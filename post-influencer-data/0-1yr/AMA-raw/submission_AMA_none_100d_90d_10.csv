After spending 7 months in jail (I couldnâ€™t afford bail) the  charges were dropped when my lawyer got her text messages where she told her friend nothing happened."
1,"I (24 F) am physically unable to have penetrative sex. Ask me anything :)


Long story short, I was born with a little anatomical abnormality that makes it impossible for me to have sex. Anything larger than a finger will cause significant tearing and bleeding. I've had my fair share of injuries down there. I have been through tons of different pain medications, hormonal treatment, physical therapy and even psychotherapy, all to no avail. I finally found a doctor willing to operate on me, and I think I will go through with it - even if there's a chance of ending up incontinent afterwards, which obviously sucks. 

Since my outer genitalia (labia, clitoris etc.) is normal I am at least able to have orgasms. I definitely have a sex drive and have never been particularly fridgid. Still, this condition has absolutely ruined my sexual life. I am a 24 year old virgin and there's nothing I can do about it. I have never been in a relationship, because I've never met a guy willing to accept this condition - which I absolutely understand. For a while I even started dating women, just out of frustration and loneliness.

I am so frustrated. I want to be able to enjoy my sexuality. I want to date guys, I want to have kids, and I want to be able to FUCK ðŸ˜‚ I'm sick of watching my friends and sisters grow up without me. I'm sick of not being able to control my own body.

Anyways, sorry for the rant. I just really wanted to get this story out there. Please feel free to ask me anything :)"
2,"I'm part of the tallest 1% in the world... ask me anything.


At 6'11"", according to most average height calculator things, I'm in the top 1% for world height, and I regularly see height related 'askreddit' threads.... while im not the tallest person in the world or even in my city, im high enough to cover most tall related issues and circumstances.

So as one of the beanstalk family, on behalf of us giants, feel free to ask me anything.... and yes I do play basketball."

5,"I lived over 10 years pretending to be an English-American, accent and all. Last year, I came clean for the first time. AMA


Hello reddit!  


My darkest secret is that I have been pretending to be English for 10 years of my life. I started when I was around 16, and I'm now 27 years old. I came clean last year, first in a letter to my best friend, and then in a sit down with my partner of 5 1/2 years at the time. I lie very compulsively, but also I do have premeditated (if that's the right word for it) lies as well. I am terribly, terribly ashamed of this behavior, and chose to come out to those two people closest to me, before opening up to the rest of my friends and coworkers (scheduled to happen this week!). I feel like part of the acknowledgement process might be understanding my feelings and thoughts a little better, and hopefully be able to go into this very big, and very scary, next step, with an open mind, and a true willingness to be honest and authentic. Oh boy, here we go. **Ask Anything.**"
6,"I let my husband sleep with other women and I like it AMA


First, there are two pieces of context. Piece number one - we're battle tested. We got married young, have been married several years and have been through a ton of life shattering things together, we have an intense amount of trust in one another, we're both hard working, competitive. Lots of chemistry, lots of fun, lots of adventure, just rock solid. The second is how it started. He started to suspect that I was bisexual. We're conservative, straight laced people for the most part. I'm not emotionally attracted to women so I had never given it a thought, every women who has had enough wine is bi. He started noticing some flirty tension with a friend if mine. He started to talk fantasy situations in the bed room. Never implying that anything would happen irl. A few years later we end up pursuing a ""hall pass"" swinging situation, where I can find a gal friend to explore it with. Basically a friends with benefits thing. I had honestly thought quite a bit about a threesome but was worried about it being awkward. Someone contacts us but is interested in my husband for the wife of the couple instead. I don't what came over me but I just said yes. I want him to have the best of everything. All the good and interesting experiences. I just want everything for him. He was astounded but gave it a chance. Fast forward half a year. I love the feeling of him going to spend a night with this married gal and coming back to me, nearly putting me through a head board with how hot for me he is. I still haven't found someone for me but the whole thing just works for me. I feel like I should feel jelouse but there isn't an ounce of it in me. Maybe it's because I picked."

9,"16 Month Survivor of Pancreatic Cancer and Still Going Strong. AMA


 

I want to offer some positive news for those recently diagnosed. I was diagnosed with PC on Feb. 6, 2018. I was given a fairly grim prognosis in my hometown. While my scans indicated that my disease had probably not spread, it appeared the tumor was involved with my hepatic artery and portal vein. They wanted to do neo-adjuvant chemo to shrink the tumor and pull it off the vessels, but if they started the Whipple and the vessels were still involved, they would have to close me back up.

For a disease as deadly as PC, I sought a second opinion at MD Anderson in Houston, where I got a much better prognosis, assuming the early chemo worked. So in March, I started four months of Fulfarinox. My CA19-9 came down from 190 to 11. I then did 5 days of high dose targeted proton radiation. When I went back in June, they said I was now ready for the Whipple. I then met the vascular team, who said they could resect the blood vessels if they were involved, but that it was high risk. They do about 10 of those per year, which is still more than anyone else.

August 20 was my Whipple day. I came through surgery after 11 hours without the need for vessel resection, even though they were involved. My surgeon was able to chip away at the tumor until it came off the vessels. I was told that only 4 of 25 lymph nodes showed any cancer and it was dead.

I then started post op chemo six weeks later, but I did not tolerate it well. I am proud to say that my scans still look clear and my 19-9 is still normal. My last chemo treatment was in November.

If I could give one piece of advice, it would be to go to a CANCER center, like MDA, Sloan-Kettering, etc. where they see more of this than anyone else. Local hospitals are great for relatively low risk issues, but for something like PC, get to the best place asap."
