0,"Legally Dead for 22 minutes, Cardiac Arrest at age 19. AMA


I'm not sure how much to write because I'm sure no one will actually read this anyway but, needless to say after reading a couple other people's stories I was inspired to post my own.

Just a lil background info to start I guess.

- No family history of heart complications or health problems 
- Doctors never did determine a cause 
- spent 4-5 ish days in a medically induced coma 
- Surprisingly minimal brain damage, although a pretty sustainable amount for 22 minutes without oxygen. ( I was getting CPR during this time but supposibly I wasn't taking to any of the breaths) 


Ugh there's so much other shit I could really say but I doubt this will even be read so I'll cut it short and say ask me anything !! ðŸ–¤"

Hey! Iâ€™ve never been vaccinated and have so far survived 16 years of life, feel free to ask me anything but please be aware that each day could be my last XD"
2,"Had a picture on r/pics make it to the front page a couple of weeks ago. I was fired for it on Friday. AMA.


A couple of weeks ago I posted a picture of the cap of the Illinois State Capitol Building which had sustained lightning damage over the years. I was told that I because I hadn't asked permission to take the photo, that I was be terminated from my position. I don't deny my error in judgment but if this serves as nothing more than a cautionary tale for the rest of the reddit community and provides you a moment of pause to consider what you are posting and how it may affect you.

Sincerely,

3,"My girlfriend faked her death. Ask me anything


So I met this girl through a dating app. We were together for almost 4 months. It was a long distance relationship as she lived far away (about a 4 hour drive) so we didn't get to see each other every day. One day, I messaged her and never got a reply. After 5 days without a reply, I ask her best friend if my gf is ok. Her friend tells me I ruined her life and said she never wants me to message her again. I get blocked. A few hours later I get a call from my gf. She says she's sorry and can no longer do this. She also said she still loves me and then hung up the phone and blocked me. I was so confused and didn't know why this happened. After 2 or 3 days, I made a new account and tried messaging her on the new account but she didn't respond. All I asked her is why she left me. I said that's all I wanted to know. I was really down and kept trying to message her best friend. I was blocked but I kept checked every single day. 

3 weeks later, I see her best friend had unblocked me. I messaged her asking what has happened. She apologized for what she said before and told me she was going to message me later that day. She then told me that my gf had passed away and she broke up with me because she didn't want me to go through the pain of losing a partner at such a young age. I was upset and very angry, as I wished I could of helped her through her illness until the very end. After hearing this, I was very depressed. Every night, I would get drunk. I got worse every day. I got into a couple fights against massive guys because I was angry. Each time I just got hit a few times and got thrown out the pub. At night I would cry myself to sleep. It was the worst pain, I have been though. I stopped talking to my mates and drove them away. My parents were always asking why I was in such a bad mood. They were getting frustrated with me. I hated life

Almost 2 months later, I'm on Snapchat and I'm looking through my gf's sisters story. I see she is at a party. In the background, I see a guy dancing with a girl who looked like my gf. I couldn't see her face, I could only see his face. I was upset as I would never see my gf again. And I've been looking at the same pics of her everyday. I wished I had taken more pictures with her. So I thought, maybe I can search for this girl, and just see if she reminds me of my gf. I know now that sounds weird, but depressed me, thought it would be comforting. So I go onto my Facebook and search through my gf's sisters friend list until I find that guy from the Snapchat story. I find him and noticed instantly that the girl in his profile picture looked so similar to my gf. Then I looked through his photos and realized it was my gf. At first, I was mad as I thought he was some creep, editing himself in photos with her. I was about to message my gf's sister. And then I realized, these were new photos of her. These were real. I messaged my gf sister and asked her about this. She said she can't deal with this. I ask her what is going on. 

10 minutes later, I get a text from a random number saying 'hey'. I ask who this is, and it's my gf. I ask her to prove its her and say this better not be a cruel joke. And she proves its her. I ask her why she done all this and how she is still alive. She explains that she had been cheating on me. She said it was too difficult being together (we were in long distance relationship). I ask her why she went through with all this. She said it was her boyfriends (the guy she was cheating with) idea. I said to her that she is mad and tell her how my life has was ruined. She said she's broke up with him. And wants me back. I say no. She asks to ring me. I say I can't deal with hearing her voice. She said she realized she was wrong and says I'm the only good guy she has ever been with. I told her she's dead to me. I then blocked her number. I kinda regretted it as I loved her so much and we were perfect together. But she had hurt me so much and I knew, I couldn't trust her.

Since then, I have had bad anxiety and can no longer trust anyone. I'm scared to talk to women. I have tried but I find it too hard. If I'm ever going to be in another relationship, I think they would have to approach me and put the effort in. That's my story. Ask me anything"
4,"I was told to wait until marriage for sex and listened. My first marriage was only so he could fuck me and leave. AMA


Hello! I don't know if anyone will even respond to this, but here it goes.

My first marriage only lasted 5 months because he only cared about getting laid. We got married quick into the relationship, I had of course NO experience with sex and was very shy in that aspect. I was always told that sex was naughty, wait until marriage, heck even masterbation is basically wrong. I hid any sexuality I had.

After a few months of being married it was pretty obvious he only got with me to have sex. He cheated on me with 2 different girls at the same time. I ended up kicking him out (we lived with MY parents) and went on to find a loving man whome I've been with for 11 years now. AMA!!"
5,"I was an escort who got trapped in a network of sex slavery in Australia. AMA.


I was an escort for two years before flying interstate (To NSW) to work for what I thought was a reputable agency, only to fall into the trap of working for an agency whom I could never fully pay off my debts too. They paid for my flights (allegedly $2000 for what usually is only a $300 flight,  forced to buy their stock clothes and outfits - also extravagantly priced - and forced to pay $1000 a day when I was too sick/tired/mentally fatigued to work). My room was $150 a night. I only made $200 an hour of my $600 p/h price, always accumulating more of a debt I was unable to pay off. I was sent to the home of drug addicts, con men and gang affiliates. I was threatened with blackamail and being ""outted"" if I left. I only managed to get out after abandoning all my belongings and buying a discounted flight one night, after confiding in a friend who wired me money, and not getting in the drivers car after a booking to return back to the apartment I was working/living in.  I lost a lot more than my possessions, was paid none of the money Id worked for, and returned home broke and broken. But alive. Ive been in counselling for the last 17 months. This is a throwaway account to tell my story to the world. I'm currently writing a book on the sex industry within the western world (Australia)  and the exploitation of our girls in the industry.  AMA."

27,"I made a documentary on why my highschool sucked, and got banned from all the county schools


In the fall of 2018 I decided to start a video on why I hated my highschool, because ya know, highschool sort of blows. Well it took me a year to make and produce and edit, and I released the video in summer of July 2019, a month after I graduated. I was afraid of getting expelled or suspended, so I waited till after graduating to post the video.

I posted it on the 19th of July, and the video blew up in my area, and it gained about 11k views, so it was pretty viral in our county, and people were basically looking at the school board for a response to the controversial video.

Any how, two weeks later I received a letter in the mail from the school board basically stating that I'm banned from all school properties and that I'm not allowed on any county campus or it will be considered trespassing. I'm not sure what they accomplished by banning me from the campus even though I already graduated, but I assume it was probably like symbolic censorship. They claim the ban was out because I illegally recorded people,but I recorded on a public campus, so I'm pretty sure they just didn't like the negative press and negative feedback they were getting from the community. No lawsuits were out out thankfully, but no homecoming for me I guess :(


Here's a link to the video if you're curious, it has its flaws, but it was a solo project so ya know:

tldr; made a documentary my school didn't like, got banned from the school"
