1,"I volunteered at a suicide hotline for over a year, and was super bummed to see an anti-hotline post get to the top of r/bestoff which contained (IMO) dangerously incomplete &amp; flawed details about the amazing life saving work that those people do. AMAA.


"
2,"I survived working at a movie theater for Avengers opening weekend. AMA


"
3,"I (M,20) have been abused by my gf (F,22) for over a year, today I ended the relationship. AMA


"
4,"I’m black AMA.


Literally anything. I don’t care how prejudice or stereotypical. Anything you really wanted to ask a black person, but wasn’t sure if it would offend them? Ask me kiddos. I’m a girl, if that changes anything."
5,"I have prosopagnosia, aka face blindness. AMA!


I can see people’s faces when I look at them, but my brain can’t remember what they look like the second I look away. I constantly walk past classmates and have completely no idea who they are. It’s easier to recognize friends or family from their body movements or hair or voice, but even then I never talk to people unless they recognize me first."
6,"Just got fired and I’m the happiest I’ve been in months. AMA.


"
7,"My brother is a sociopath, but I survived my childhood! AMA


"

Hello there, my name’s Alexei, my age is almost 19. I’m from Yakutsk, it’s city in Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya), u can find it on Google Maps and realize where it is (because of course you don’t know where it is XD).
Average temperature here is: Winter -40C/F; Summer +30C/+86F. We have a lot of rare animals and insects (i’ve never seen those beings though), beautiful nature (only during the summer lol) and matryoshka. 
It’ll be so nice if y’all ask me something you wanna know about my or people’s life here!

P.S.
Sorry for my English"
