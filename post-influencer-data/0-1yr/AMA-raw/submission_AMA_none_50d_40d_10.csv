0,"My parents still don't talk about it


When i was 8 my dad had his own church, it was like a branch, or local chapter. I was raped multiple times by a higer up in the church and when i told my parents, instead of calling the police they asked him if it was true. He said yes but that i must be possessed as i had seduced him. I was them sent away to a camp to be exorcised, basically was beaten till i realised they wanted me to say it was my fault. I did, they sent me home. I'm now 40 and to this day it has never been spoken of. AMA..."
1,"My husband is a paedophile [UK] AMA


This year I found child pornography produced by my husband on his PC. I called the police and he was arrested. There is an active court case currently in progress so I may have to skirt around some specifics when it comes to the case. 

My friends and family have been very supportive but also have been morbidly curious about the ins and outs of everything. I thought this may be something interesting to discuss here on reddit. Feel free to AMA"
2,"My Mormon parents found out how to set restrictions on my phone with Screen Time and are having a blast with it AMA


My parents went to a work party a few weeks ago. One of the parents there showed my mom all the ins and outs of restricting pretty much everything on my phone. 

It started with just time limits. 2 hours a day for social networking and 2 hours a day for games/entertainment. Then they changed it to one hour. 

Then my parents banned every website except for a select few such as PBS Kids, CBeebies, NatGeo Kids, and Disney. Because apparently they think I'm 5. [Google.com](https://Google.com) is blocked. The website I use to check my grades is blocked. Everything is blocked.

They also immediately removed the ability to use incognito mode or clear my history, so ""5 Harry Potter Actors That Have Grown Up Into Hunks"" is forever set in stone in my web history until the day I die. And I guess I just have to live with that.

Then my parents banned all apps rated 17+. So Reddit, Youtube, and Tumblr just vanished from my phone. I am typing this from my school owned chromebook because even that is less restricted than my phone. Hello to the random school administrator possibly reading this. Tumblr is blocked on school computers as well, and Tumblr is the only line of communication I have between me and one of my friends who recently moved across the country.

Then they banned all explicit music. So I woke up to find about a quarter of my songs missing from my library. I'm paying for my apple music subscription out of my pocket, but... ok I guess.

One of the only apps they didn't restrict is imgur, because when I told them it was a photo storing app they thought that seemed alright. So now I get all my memes from there. It's a significant downgrade. Half of it is bad facebook memes and reposts that are years old, but it's better than nothing.

Anyway, ask away I guess.

Also to whoever taught my mom how to do this, you are a waste of Earth's resources. Go sit in a corner and think about what you did."

7,"I was lucky enough to escape the FLDS cult along with my entire family, Ama.


I was born in 1995 and was in the [FLDS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-Day_Saints) up until 2006, [when I escaped with my family.] (http://imgur.com/a/MvZao8L) this is the first picture we took outside of the FLDS, I'm the tall one in the back. We had moved in with our dad who had been asked to leave and repent from afar, which basically meant that he fell out of favor with the current prophet [Warren jeffs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Jeffs). And had us relocated into another family to be watched closely. Our dad kept in contact with our Mom through secret meetups, eventually they decided enough was enough and they couldn't live this way. So they planned an escape with only the two of them knowing. I still remember that day clearly I had gotten up and was just getting ready for school when our mother came in our room and said ""we're going on a picnic, bring only clothes and don't tell anyone"". At the time I was just psyched that we were skipping school. It wasn't until years later I realized the amount of planning went into this. she waited until everyone at the house was occupied so she would not be pursued when we left. It wasn't until we got out of town have they realized what happened. I consider us one of the lucky ones because we got out with our entire family. So many families have been torn apart to this day. 

I skimmed a of the details as I wanted to see if anyone was interested in listening to my story."
