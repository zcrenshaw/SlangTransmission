163,"I can’t seem to make any real friends as an adult?


Okay, so growing up I was the kid that never had a group of friends. I was the kid who got into every social group and got along with everyone.

But no one ever wanted to play with me outside of school (except my one best friend from daycare to present). But that was no big deal because I was more mature and preferred to do my own thing anyway.

Fast forward to now. I moved to a new state for college by myself, and then after college moved to another new state all by myself. 

The problem: in each new place I have a job, and I get along with people at my jobs very well. Like, telling jokes and laughing so hard we can’t actually work for a few minutes. They tell me about stuff going on in their lives and ask me for advice. They ask me sincerely about my life outside of work and are happy when I’m happy.

They even talk about inviting me to this, that, and the other thing every now and again.

So why, in both of these new states, with people all so friendly and open to me, do they never ever invite me to anything outside of work?

Is there something I could be doing to help this?
I know this might sound kind of childish (idk if that’s the word for it?) but making friends as an adult is hard!"
