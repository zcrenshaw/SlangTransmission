593,"Mess......


currently i am facing with the drawbacks of being too much following ideal ideas. be it in dharma or be it morality. my own demons caught me of having or the want to become too good as to be God. Is it the drawback of reading and learning too much. this has arises due to an incident in my life.. I tried to follow some ideas of morality from the life of various Indian kings who respected and protected the women's of enemies even after they did not did the same. I too tried to do so this, but I forget I am not a king. I do not justify my misdeeds in this regard. I am now caught in between my own thinking. If I did not do any wrong this caused the pain, what would have happened if I did have kept aside my morality and did it. The actual seen is as follows:- I am actually working in govt sector. And there came a new lady employee. Its all got messed up as she was newly married and I was not. Its all about sex. I got driven towards her by mere motivation from others.. Being not over into her by my own mind, i t was just list nothing else. She said nothing and it was no from her end. But circumstances didn't last long.. It took a wrong turn and everything got messed up.. My morality always said no. Even I tried every means to get away from her way and cleared my path towards other thing while still helping her. Nature was playing its role and for the first time in my life ego arise in my mind. The ego took the form of morality and I tried to get rid of her through trying to help her simultaneously. Now, the ego has taken its ugly form and its caused everyone's ego to rise. Those who support her, was given power by me. Knowingly or unknowingly the mess is being created. Now, in such a situation, my mind is in doubt that did following idealistic ideas or learning too much is the problem. Is it correction in the problem or problem itself is corrupted. Is it a part of narcaristic behavior or is it morality? Does reading good creates good or it creates bad.. Everything is messed up the logical mind, the rational mind, the scientific mind, the spiritual mind... Logic is begetting logic.. Its not one side fault its both side.? Does following morality in public and not following it in personal life is the problem.. Or is it some mess of the mind game that I don't understand.. What is neti neti say is that I have followed my positive intitution. It was positive not only to me but to all, as it is my thinking... May be might I may be wrong or I might be right. But is this the mind justifies in an irrational way.. Blaming does not solve the problem.. In the first sense there is no problem at all. But it is as it is... It can't be like that though it seems... What is this all.. Can anyone explain?..."
