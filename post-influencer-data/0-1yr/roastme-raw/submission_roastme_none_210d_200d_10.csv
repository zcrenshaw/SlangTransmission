12,"Rule Changes: ROASTEES MUST BE 18 or older (and more!)


Hi all!

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, the moderators of this subreddit were contacted by the Reddit admins, who made us aware that many users had brought our sub to their attention. Specifically, they were made aware of concerns that some bad-faith participants were using our sub to bully minor children. For example, someone posting dozens of kids from their school, without the majority of those people truly knowing what r/RoastMe is or what being roasted entails. 

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously we take these concerns very seriously. The purpose of r/RoastMe is to be a comedy sub. We want people to laugh, not to be harassed when they come here. Bullying and harassment are also a violation of the Reddit User Agreement, and it is important that we as a subreddit not be seen as running afoul of these rules. 

&amp;nbsp;

As a result, we have made some changes to our current rules, which are listed below: 

&amp;nbsp;

- All Roastees must be **18 years old or older** in order to be posted on our sub. We are going to be cracking down on posts where the Roastee appears to be underage. This will include photos that were clearly taken in a setting where most people would be &lt;18, such as high school classrooms or photographs of people in high school uniforms. 

&gt;&gt; *If your post is wrongly removed for this reason, you may submit proof of your age to us via modmail in order to have your post restored. This will follow the same procedure that we currently use to verify that users are over the age of 16.*

- **All** of the people in the photograph must consent to being Roasted. Consent is **the most important rule** on our subreddit. This means that photographs with bystanders whose faces are visible or who are otherwise identifiable *will be removed*. Do not take pictures in crowded areas where lots of other people are in the background. Every single person in the picture must be aware of the sign, and must be indicating their intent to be roasted (by holding the sign, pointing to it, etc.).

&gt;&gt; *We previously had a rule in place to forbid bystanders from being roasted. This new rule is replacing that rule, and cutting off the opportunity for non-consenting people to be roasted on the front-end, rather than relying on back-end comments policing.*

- This also means that we will be removing posts where it is not clear that the person pictured understands what Reddit is, or consents to being roasted. This includes posts with titles like ""She doesn't know what Reddit is, what better way to show her!"" or ""My friend doesn't speak English, Roast Him!"" You can still post pictures of your friends, your coworkers, or your Fantasy Football league members, but **everyone** needs to be in on the fun.

&gt;&gt; Please be mindful of how you title your posts. Just like we do with underage users, we will be tracking people who post non-consenting Roastees and we will ban you if you try to post that person again. 

&amp;nbsp;

We know that some of these rule changes may be annoying, frustrating, or inconvenient, particularly for our international users, where 16 is the age of majority. However, given that Reddit is an American company, we need to comply with the rules of majority for the USA. 

&amp;nbsp;

We are making these rule changes to comply with the Reddit admins' requests and because we want to be transparent with you, the users, about the things that can get our subreddit in trouble. The new rules are a modified version of the rule changes that were proposed to us by the admins. We ask that you also be vigilant in reporting posts that appear to break the new rules, or send us a modmail if you notice a particularly problematic user who is ruining the fun for everyone else. 

&amp;nbsp;
