"Anal/rectal pain, doctors &amp; me not sure what it is -- DESPERATE for help!


So I (32M, bottom) have been struggling for about 2 years now of pain in my rectum that keeps me from having sex with my partner (and even just pooping). I've seen numerous doctors, and all say it seems fine and my skin is fragile and to use lots of lube... but I just can't accept these answers. Not only can I not have a normal sex life, but I also have issues with my bowl movements.

Symptoms

* When in acute phase (usually happens after passing hard/large stool) : extreme sharp pain when defecating / can hardly wipe / constant burning or stinging feeling throughout the day / lots of tightness (from the pain, I'm guessing) / obviously nothing goes in there not even a finger-- Usually lasts about 1 week to 2 weeks -- Usually happens in the 7-8 o'clock position, sometimes 12 o'clock
* When in chronic phase (the rest of the time) : occasional discomfort when defecating / very hard to do any anal play because it's tight and I'm scared of starting another acute episode...

In the past 2 years I was probably able to have sex 4-6 times. My partner is quite large, so that doesn't help, but before that period, I would be able to have sex no problem, anytime, all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to be very rigorous with metamucil / water, but even that only helps to stay in the chronic phase I find, without ever bringing me to my normal functional state. Also, I haven't noticed any physical changes in my anal area, but if I finger myself (to apply cream for example), I do feel some ""papillae"" (I think?).

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear from bottoms who've lived similar situations (or tops who have lived this with their partners). I am extremely depressed about it and I feel incomplete because of it. I feel most doctors aren't LGBT-ized enough to handle this problem. I feel like if a woman showed up and said her vagina felt like it was on fire and hurt like that, she'd be taken more seriously and perhaps better treated. I dunno...

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR : I'm a bottom with extreme / chronic pain (2+ years) in rectal/anal area and even after seeing doctors, it's still not treated and it keeps me from being sexually functional (and even taking normal shits). I'm depressed and hoping someone could guide me towards recovery.**"
"My sexuality


I‚Äôve been straight all my life but am kinda turned on by the thought of being gay and kinda wanted to hookup with a guy before I decide what I really want to be any help would be appreciated "

My boyfriend and I are contemplating purchasing a double sided dildo. Yay or nay? Has anyone on here used one before? Tips/recommendations would be greatly appreciated."
"NSFW canvas prints?


Do any of you know where I can get a canvas print of some NSFW artwork that I've commissioned? It does depict sex but it's clearly consensual, if not tasteful. I was going to use [easycanvasprints.com](https://easycanvasprints.com) but they don't print ""pornography."" Any suggestions would be appreciated. "

"Scammed...


I was scammed. Not too bad but still. So on the last day of 2018 as i was leaving work to get ready for dinner with some friends i got a text message on Grindr(red flag #1) from an older man. He started by stating his name and that he was looking for someone to be his sugar babby. Next he left his contact information. Mavin Carl was the name. 
I'm young. I'm broke. And the thought of easy money worked on me like sugar works on ants. And i was hooked. So i texted him on the number he provided and we talked for a bit. He told that to start off my weekly allowance would 400¬£ and 1000¬£ if i could remain a good boy to him( red flag #2). At that point i thought to myself: how bad could it be. So i just need to send some sexy pics every week to some guy and I'll get easy cash nbd. The day ends, no more texts. I get ready and go out with friend. So far. So good. Everything is well and no one is hurt. 
Day 1 comes. We start talking and he asks for a way to send me money. He suggest paypal. I am familiar with the platform. Seemed easy enough. I create a new account. I link a private bank account that is empty and safe to burn should this go ugly. I text him my PayPal link and i wait. 6 min go by. He texts back. As good scam technique demands, there was a problem. He texts back, he's telling me that for some reason a bank needs him to insert a code for a 50‚Ç¨ (red flag #3) iTunes gift card code. 
At this point I'm already suspecting this might not be for real and he's just playing me. But I'm stoopid and the money could come in handy. He also tells me that he will transfer me 550 for the trouble of having to buy the gift card, that btw, he can't buy himself for some reason. 
I tell him that all stores are closed and that only on the 2nd I'll be able to buy the gift card. No more conversation happens. 
Latter as I'm chilling i start looking at an image he sent me. A supposed print screen from his phone showing the bank request for the giftcard. And the more i analyze the sketchier it looks. The thing looks like it was made in paint. I point it off and he gets supper offended saying that was insulting him and what not (red flag #4). I apologize and the conversation ends. He sends one last text prompting me to buy the card the next day ASAP. 
This leads us to today where it all went downhill. So the morning comes. I go down to the store, let him know I'm buying the card and he tells me : "" when you get the card text me the code and don't leave the store"" (red flag #5). I get the card. Text the code. 5 min later i get a text from him saying that 50‚Ç¨ were not enough and i needed to buy another one. This time he says he'll transfer 1000‚Ç¨ to compensate for the trouble (red flag #6: increasing amount promised) Stupid as i am i bought the card and texted the code. And sure enough this was enough for the transfer to be completed and i must now await 5 hours ( why 5 hr specifically? I have np idea) to get the money. 
It's time for me to get to work. That's a nice distraction and by the time i get off i surely should have received the money. The day goes by. Nothing too exciting. I leave work. I check my account. No money. And this is when it hits me, once again, that i just got scammed. So i text him. I pointed out all the flaws in found in the print screens from the supposed bank app. Once again he flips, saying I insulted him and that i must be patient. So now I'm like wtv. I already lost the money. Might as well wait. It's currently 23h46 as I'm writing this and i still have no sight of the money. I've texted him a few times and still no response... 
As this goes on i keep thinking back to ground zero for this mess : if he wanted my PayPal he should never have been using the bank app. This the first RED FLAG that i stupidly ignored. Also the text from the bank app was full of grammatical mistakes that were a dead give away. 

In the end money spoke louder and my wish for easy money turned expensive real quick. 
Stay tuned for potential updates. If any of you has any tips on how to deal with this mess feel free to dm me. 

Sorry for the rambling and possible poor formatting I'm on mobile typing away. Just letting out my frustrations...

"I volunteer at a local thrift store that‚Äôs run mostly volunteer elderly women and this little conversation warmed my heart


[Sorry I‚Äôm using YouTube, I‚Äôd use Streamable but I can‚Äôt get that to work](https://youtu.be/c8wepxGM-m8)

(Where one of the ladies says ‚Äúoh that was terrible‚Äù she was referring to the aids epidemic)

**Backstory:** As the title says, I volunteer at a local thrift store that works within an old community center. It‚Äôs a nonprofit so all the money goes straight to keeping the building up. We‚Äôve gotten some expensive brands come in like Gucci and Prada which surprises me. Anyways, the people who work here are all ran by volunteers. They‚Äôre all at least 60 years old. It‚Äôs mostly just women but there are two men, who are married to of the women that work there. 

Today, we were wrapping up for the day and there were these large bedazzled high heels somebody had donated. One of the ladies said crossdressers would have a blast with them. I said, do any of you know of any drag queens that live around here? Then that snowballed into a conversation about gay people, and the video is of a snippet of that conversation. Two of the three that were present during the conversation said that they used to work with drag queens. At one point, another volunteer walked in and one of the ladies said ‚ÄúOh we are just talking about gays.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt get the entire conversation because I was sending it to somebody at the time through Snapchat.

One of the ladies said that their husband was traditional and didn‚Äôt want anything to do with gay people. She was telling the story about how her granddaughter is gay and that she was getting married. The two grandparents were invited but the husband didn‚Äôt want to go to see two gay people kiss. The wife (again, the one who volunteers) said ‚ÄúWell I just told him if he doesn‚Äôt want to see them kiss, just don‚Äôt watch.‚Äù Another lady that was there was saying ‚Äúif they‚Äôre not hurting anyone, why discriminate?‚Äù

These group of ladies that were here for the conversation were all in their 70‚Äôs. It warms my heart seeing the older generation so accepting üíõ

(They don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm gay but I‚Äôm not closeted, I just don‚Äôt feel the need to announce it)

"Is it possible to just be friends?


I am just wondering how many other bros have made gay friends that are JUST friends.  I ask because I had sex with many guys in my past that were just friends but I was able to separate sex and friendship in most cases. That took a hit on may of my friendships developing of course but I corrected that and have a few good friends today. Seeing if any other bro has been in the same conundrum "
"Advice needed


I live in a homophobic country. Being gay is not illegal but is highly frowned upon and gay people are never out of the closet. But I like life here in general. I love my mom and the few friends I have left. I know I won't be truely happy if I move to another country but I also know I will never be truely happy if I stay either. Many friends of mine live abroad- Germany, the UK, Denmark but they all tell me people there are super different from us and they can't seem to get acquainted and befriend people there. And I have heard the same thing from many, many other people- friends of my mom and aunt and so on. So I guess what I am asking is 1.how can I come to accept the fact that I will probably be single all my life and just live and work here and the opposite option 2. Being gay in another country where making acquaintances and friends is very likely to be quite hard?"

"How to be single in your 30s?


Hey Gaybros,
So I will be turning 30 shortly and I am terrified of being 30 and still single. While I have a great career, my own place and all that jazz, I haven‚Äôt had the good fortune of being in too many relationships &amp; I haven‚Äôt made much dating progress since my early 20s. How do people gays perceive you being 30 and still single? How do you single bros over 30 handle being single and seeing all your friends have nice weddings and kids?

"Girly moans


I'm a bottom. I've tried topping a few times and its not really my thing...
I also happen to moan uncontrollably when bottoming, its just something i do, and i find it hard to stay quiet - its natural i guess.

The thing is, I turn very feminine when i moan, its safe to say that i pretty much sound like a girl. And in all honesty... Maybe its just me (i never dared to ask) but i feel like thats quite a turn off...

The sounds i make are personally a little bit of a complex of mine... I feel like its a part of me that's for some odd reason not masculine enough.

I don't know... I guess i'm looking for advice... Maybe a few options?

So for my next question.... how many guys out there find feet hot? It seems to be pretty common from what I‚Äôve seen.

Me for example, I‚Äôm about 80/20 bisexual and find guys and girls feet really hot! Girls generally have nicer feet as they look after them more.

If you like feet, what is it about then?

"How does bisexual work


Recently realized I might not be 100 percent straight. Last thing I want to seem is homophobic. I believe in the future, in common human decency, not degenerate fear. but I'm clearly not handling this discovery about myself well. My entire sense of my place in the world was based around the idea that I am... ""Normal"" I don't want that to be taken as offensive, just you know what I mean? In my experience, homosexual people are actually more logically sound, emotionally stable, and overall just friendlier people. I don't know where I stand. I want to be proud. But I feel completely undermined, like my concrete base has turned to sand, and it's Ruining my ability to function at work and perform to a level I need to be capable of. Anyone able to give me some advice on... I guess... Keeping your logical side intact while having an emotional crisis? Thanks guys. "
