Here‚Äôs the story‚Ä¶

Almost 5 years ago, one night I stayed up very late studying for a test in school the next day. I was in my bedroom on the second floor, where all the bedrooms in my home are located, when I heard noises downstairs. I immediately knew something was wrong because my three younger siblings and parents were all sleeping, so no one should have been downstairs. I was panicking, and grabbed the closest thing that seemed like it could be a weapon, which was a ski pole that was in my closet. I waited around the corner at the top of the stairs, and heard someone slowly walking up the steps. When he rounded the corner at the top of the stairs, I hit him with all my might with the ski pole over the head. He fell to his knees, and dropped the gun he had been holding. I picked it up, and without really thinking, shot him twice.

He had duct tape, rope, and a gun with five bullets in it. My father is a prosecutor, and he had gotten this man sentenced to prison for about five years 10 years before this happened, and he wanted revenge. We believe that he was planning on tying up my father and making him watch him kill me, my siblings and mother.

I wasn‚Äôt charged or anything, as it is considered self defense"
