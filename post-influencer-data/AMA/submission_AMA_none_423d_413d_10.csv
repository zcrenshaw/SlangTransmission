"My dad is a missing person and was featured on Unsolved Mysteries, AMA


I am always looking for ways to get my father's case in the media, because that's how cases get solved.  So why not an AMA on it.  I'm also doing many blog interviews and starting to get it on several podcasts.

My dad, Dale Williams, disappeared 19 years ago from Nucla, Colorado.  Nucla is a very small town on the western slope with an aprx population of 1200 when my father went missing.  I was 19, in college and not living at home, but my sister was still in high school and was 17.  

When I was a senior in high school, my parents helped move an x-friends wife out of state for her own safety and for her sons.  She was in a very unhealthy relationship with a high school friend of my dads.  My parents wouldn't tell him where she was, but she did eventually call him and tell him.  

My father received a phone call the day he disappeared from a ""stranded motorist"" asking for help in Paradox Valley, about 25 miles from Nucla.  My dad said he'd bring the wrecker, but the caller apparently told him they just needed a jump.  We know this because a friend was there at the time the call came in.  My dad stopped by his best friends workplace and talked to his wife, and that was the last anyone saw him.  6 weeks later, my dads truck was found in the confluence of the Delores and San Miguel rivers between Paradox and Uravan.  It was completely submerged in over 13' of water, was put in when it was raining as the windshield wipers were on, the ignition was on, and the wheel  was turned at a very sharp angle.  The drivers window was rolled down half way.  

Over the next few months several of my fathers tools were found strewn thru the local mountains.  There are about 500 mines in the area as well and the area is quite desolate.  My mother had noticed that the missing person fliers were being removed from the post office.  Every week she'd hang more up.  Eventually, they installed a camera to find out that the x-friend was tearing down the posters.  They questioned him, but apparently nothing significant came from it.

So, that was 19 years ago.  My dad was a great person.  He was funny, a good dad, he could have been a better husband come to find out, but they did a good job hiding their problems as my sister and I had a very wonderful, and memorable childhood.  Both our parents showed us nothing but love at all times.  My father was very involved in the community, would help anyone he could however he could, which seems it inevitably led to his untimely disappearance.  

There have been many rumors of course; he went to an island, he was into drugs, he ran off with some other woman and faked his death, he's alive and well in Michigan... the list of expected theories is long.  What I can tell you is that the case is still active when it's active and when it's cold, it's cold for years.  The CBI tracks down every lead they can, there's been several investigators on the case but we really like the one that's on it now the most.  My dad disappeared in 1999, and my sister and I weren't questioned ONCE until 2013 and that's when the current investigator started on it.  No one ever asked us ""when was the last time you saw your dad?""  We are very grateful for him.

So ask away, I'll answer what I legally can.

"AMA I am an Original GLOW “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” The hit Netflix show GLOW is based on an actual show from the 80’s. Do you want to know more?


I'm noticing that a high percentage of the new Netflix GLOW series fans, DO NOT realize this was an actual show in the mid and late 80's.  It seems to me that if you are enjoying this series you may enjoy learning about, talking to and following one or more of the original ladies of GLOW!  I'd love to find out, so please comment and let's start a conversation.  Thanks."
"I’m a childhood sex trafficking survivor, have attempted suicide 5 times, and have bipolar 1. But now I’m happy! AMA!


I (24F) was sex trafficked by my stepfather ages 1-6. I struggled a lot with it in my teens, but now my PTSD is asymptotic, I’m happily engaged, and have an upper-level management position. My bipolar could stand to be more stable, but I’m working on it and getting better everyday. 

There’s hope for everyone out there struggling! AMA"
"I was homeless since 2015, now my wife and kids just moved in with me, and I’ll be getting my masters degree next year in one of the best ITAM programs in the U.S


My son was just born in June, and I just got into Central Washington’s master’s cyber security program because of my network connection in my concert car invention, ( and probably because of my fearless attitude)

I have been traveling all around the U.S and the west coast for a couple years until I met my wife in 2016 and now we finally found enough grants to go to school full time while living together. I am becoming a systems analyst while my wife is becoming a nurse. I froze in my car and overheated in my car to save money for my family. Sure, those 2 degree nights and and 114 degree days were tough, but I’d do it all again for my family. Those were some of the best days of my life, oddly enough. I could do whatever I wanted, because of lack of expenses. 
I am more motivated than ever, now that my wife safely made it through her HG pregnancy symptoms which almost killed her by not letting her eat or drink for multiple days at a time.

Here’s a video of my family for those curious [My Family](https://youtu.be/9KhcSs10zaM)"
"I got out of prison 98 days ago. AMA


Served 9 years 8 months, minus a few hours since I got arrested just after 8 PM and released just after 11 AM. I've been chiming in on prison-related topics in other threads so I figured I'd try to make an actual AMA."
"I just survived 2 types of cancer, 6 rounds of chemo and have had a total hysterectomy at the age of 27. AMA.


I had a 6 inch tumor on my ovary that was cancerous, when I found this out and had surgery, I also learned that I had uterine cancer. I ALSO found out I had suffered from endometriosis since 14, however did not know this until after my organs were removed. 6 rounds of chemo, two surgeries and I’m a 28 year old that’s going through menopause... ask me anything! "
"I used to be a neo nazi sympathizer and believed that Jewish secret societies rule the world. AMA!


As the title says, I used to be an alt-right type of guy, believed that certain races were inferior.

I also believed a lot of conspiracy theories like chemtrails, Jewish/satanist secret societies controlling us from the shadows and mind control radio towers.

I ""cured"" myself from these ideologies a few years ago and I believe I can shed some light on why some people fall into that mindset and how I personally got out of it."
"I was falsely accused of Aggravated Sexual Assult on a Minor, Went to Jail, Fought my court battle, and was found NOT GUILTY on all charges. AMA


My story is in my post history, if your interested. 

Common Questions:

Q: When did it happen?

False Incident happened in 2009, Reported in 2011, arrested in 2012, court battle in 2014.

Q: Proof?

I would provide court transcripts, however, it would cost well over 3k to get them, and I do not have the funds for that. I do have my Not Guilty paperwork, which is needed for a lot of things nowadays, but i don't feel comfortable sharing that.

Q: How long will you be answering the questions?

Most, if not rest of the day. "
