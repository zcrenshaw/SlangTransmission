# SlangTransmission
This is the code and data I am using for an independent research project looking into factors relating to the role of influencers in rise of slang terms in certain groups on Reddit.

Minimal work will be done before August.

FILES IN THIS REPO:

Web-Slang-Project-Proposal.docx
	Copy of original proposal

proposal.txt
	plain text copy of proposal

workflow.txt
	File explaining the function of each file

scripts/
	Holds all of the scripts and input files for the scripts used for data collection and analysis

Any folder with "data" in the title holds the data that I collected.
