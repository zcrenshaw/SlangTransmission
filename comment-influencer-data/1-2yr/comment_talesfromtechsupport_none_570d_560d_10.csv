Sounds about right. I don't think I've ever seen a rule come down from on high that didn't need immediate widespread exceptions to be made to allow people to do their jobs...
"The last job I had I was the sole person who happened to know enough about every system in the business to be able to provide support, on my employment contract they had a clause of ""you will be required to answer your phone for phone support of production issues""

New boss listened to my complaints about getting called for 4-10 hours on call every weekend and on the refusal of the business to train staff in more systems to provide assistance with on call. Looked over my contract. All he said was ""it doesn't say anywhere here that you need to be sober"".

Only took 1 weekend of me being unable to assist with production issues for training and a rotating roster to be set up. But by golly that weekend was fun and the next Monday was glorious. "

What a sneaky loophole. Nice work to whoever found that one.
I'd bet money on it.
"Reminds me of a situation when I left a previous job. It had been a pretty good job overall, but there were various shady things going on and after I spoke up about them one too many times to the wrong individuals, I was berated and fired; lucky for me I had already accepted a new job and was putting in my notice that day.  Fortunately I was able to smooth things over a bit on my way out (protip: regardless of how others are wrong, always take full ownership of your own mistakes).

In less than a month they called me up and asked if I could come in for a day to help them figure out a problem. They offered me significantly more than my usual pay and I didn't have any actual responsibilities at my new job yet, so my boss encouraged me to take a day off and go help them out, awkward as it was.  

This was a financial company and they couldn't reconcile two of their massively complex accounting reports that I had developed. I spent the full 8 hours going over everything I could and didn't see a problem. Eventually I went back to talking to the head of IT and the controller separately about what I was seeing and it became clear that they were expecting two different things. Once we identified this breakdown in communication, it became easy to find the problem.

I had been telling them fore YEARS that they needed to engage in a more formal (yet simple) process of writing down requirements, reviewing them, and signing off on them. They never wanted to bother. So I had the satisfaction of saying ""The reason this all happened and you had to hire a consultant to fix it is because you refused to put your requirements in writing, as I have advised you many times in the past. I hope you'll take that advice more seriously in the future.""  They paid me a whopping $1,000 for my single day of work and I got to further improve my long-term relationship with those guys who continue to provide glowing references for me whenever I need them, even after the unfortunate way I left."
"I once argued that the procedure for the after hours help deal HAD to be ""call until you get a response"". Voice mails are insufficient. Emails are insufficient. If it is an emergency, get vocal confirmation that the appropriate person is on the case.  
My boss insisted email was fine. Emergency response procedures for the next incident that occurred after 11 p.m. was not started until 7 a.m. the following morning, because the on call phone decided to drop the WiFi connection (still showed as connected but literally 0 data throughput) and stopped checking for emails.

He never did admit that he was wrong about that, but the policy got changed afterwards. "

Username is mildly forgiveable, especially if you have more than one Tim Smith for instance.

I actually had someone put black tape on the bottom of their mouse because the red light bothered them. They couldn't figure out why it stopped working... I promptly took it away and put in a old school ball mouse. Thank God for the junk drawer.

Edit: I used the ball mouse as a quick fix, ordered another optical without the red. Swapped them when user wasn't in, never heard anything else (yet...)

"I'm going to have to side with the guy turning off data.

Every place I've been that does on-call has required a phone call. There is no way I am checking every email I get after-hours, let alone waking up for every email I get in the middle of the night.

Frankly if there is a problem somewhere, and it's not urgent enough to generate a phone call, then it's not urgent enough for on-call service."
That was frustrating to read
"
One of my previous workplaces they hired a qa who's job out was to create automated test suites (through selenium etc), he spent months working on getting through their manual tests and automating them.

He pulled me up one day asked for some help, he managed to finish the cases with full test reports and videos. 

The qa lead had just finished going through the new testing system and told him the automation is useless since to use it effectively they would need to hire more staff to watch every video to confirm the were no errors and double check it all by running through each test again manually. 

For every test run.

 So may as well do it manually in the first place. 

The poor guy tried to explain to the qa lead that all she needed to do was read the report and look at the videos linked to the failed tests. 

He quit within a month of that meeting. "

"I predict she'll be looking for a new job, if she isn't already.

I've worked in a department where the people in charge of making decisions for it knew nothing about it, and had no interest in knowing anything, and it was a case of them implementing a square peg in a round hole policy, then calling me into their office to explain why their square pegs were not going into the round holes.

I wasn't even the manager. The manager quit due to stress, and it took them 11 months to find a replacement (After which I was declared redundant and laid off).

They fired him after six months after they got tired of him pointing out many of the problems they had would be non-issues if they actually followed the policies they had in place to cover such issues.

The only reason that place is still in business is because it was owned by a larger company with deep pockets to keep it afloat."
"I have a near identical story.

The context is that the server room was unlocked and used for supplies. The staff would somewhat regularly cause outages by messing with stuff physically and when their manager demanded we fix the situation. We asked for an onsite downtime window. We moved all the supplies out of the room and into the hall and locked the server room door. That's what we were told to do and that's what we did. The owner approved this I'm told.

The managers were rather angry with this and demanded keys to the room. We didnt give them the keys until they found the new home for the supplies. But imagine that... the outages disappeared.

Then 1 day awhile later we get a call that the server room is on fire. My instant response? ""Why are you calling me, call 911"" and I hung up. 

Day later the owner is pissed because IT was told the server room is on fire and we never responded. My boss requests a phonecall between us all. We start the call and I speak up, ""There was a user who does not have access to the server room who said the server room is on fire. This would suggest pretty significant fires and so I told them to call 911. It would be bad for us to go onsite and get in the way of firefighters.""

The owner basically then just agreed with us. The crazy thing... there wasnt a fire. Yet the owner wanted us to investigate why there was a fire. But there wasnt a fire...

So we go get that employee who shouldnt have been in the server room. She shows us the 'electrical fire' and she points to the flashes of lights inside the server. 

I pull the front plastic bit off the front of the tower and the hard drives are blinking. She says, ""You dont have to be an asshole about it."" I never fucking said a word but right then I decided I was going to deserve being called an asshole.

I collected 5 or so emails from this lady that came into the service account. I sent that to the owner as part of my 'investigation of the fire' with pictures of the hard drives. "
"Those 1.75 words describe every moment of every day I spent at that call center. I got away with murder there. They treated their employees like cattle, so people would leave after only a few months. I became the most senior representative on the floor in only six months. I became pretty damn good at my job and knew the rules and billing system inside and out, but they refused to promote me or raise my pay. I got pretty disgruntled. They had a zero tolerance policy for hanging up on customers, but I started to ignore that. I quickly found out that I could hang up on customers with impunity, and started disconnecting calls at the slightest hint of disrespect. I even told the customers that I was going to do it, too. Some guy told me I should go into the bathroom and masturbate while thinking about my mother, so I told him that now he gets to wait through the que all over again. It was at least an hour long wait. By the end, I was disconnecting 20% of nearly 500 calls per week. If management knew about it, they never said a single word about it to me or my supervisor.  
  
Edit: What I should have said was, ""Well actually, I'm masturbating right now thinking about hanging up on you and making you wait another hour to get someone on the phone."" I used to spend a lot of time thinking about what I should have said to that guy.  
  
Edit 2: They also added a sales aspect to our list of responsibilities; we were expected to give a sales pitch to every customer who qualified, regardless of whether they were just calling in to make a payment, or calling to sort out a serious billing error (one customer got a bill for a million dollars). We were told that if we didn't meet our sales quota 3 months in a row, we would be terminated. I didn't make a single sale, and worked there for over a year after they added the sales aspect. "
"I used to work in a call center where an employee used his access to the customer database to steal hundreds of identities. The people at the top said, ""hey, just make it a paperless environment. They can't copy down ssn's without pen and paper, right?"" Of course we kept using paper. They had this idea that you could have paper, but it had to be in one of those clear plastic sleeves that have holes for a 3 ring binder. Once a year, someone would come in to inspect us. We always knew a week in advance that it was going to happen, so our managers would walk around the floor handing out plastic sleeves to put any unsleeved paper in. It was such a massive waste of effort."
"Had a funny feeling it was outlook.

Company i used to work at had at least two whole departments of people exactly like this."
"Back in my Navy days, there was a local civilian tech rep who assisted us with troubleshooting new systems that weren't well documented yet.  This was before everyone carried cell phones.  If we needed him after hours or on weekends, we didn't even try to call his house first...  we just called the bar he hung out in.  Only if he wasn't there did we try his home number.

We rarely needed to call his house."
