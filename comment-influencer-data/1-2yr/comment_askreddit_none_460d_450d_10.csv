"Read this part first:
&gt; While rape is despicable at the human level

We still have animal nature. Rape is all over the animal kingdom, from rabbits to lions to whatever. As an evolutionary action, it has worked well for many species. I would argue that it does not work well for modern humans, but you seem to have missed that. So weird. It is almost like I must have wrote: I support the rape of humans instead of what I actually wrote.

Does anyone have some brains that I can borrow? Apparently, what I write is not what people read. Communication is VERY difficult."

"I don't think it's transphobic. I'm not saying that trans people aren't men or women, I'm only saying trans people, along with non binary people, often prefer the use of the term pan because it implicitly supports the idea that gender is not rigid, and is a spectrum. Or that gender is not really important.  It also signals that I am not likely going to be transphobic if they message me on dating apps, because it's statistically less likely for me to be transphobic if I identify as such."

"I don't think Trump makes every non-white person afraid.

One thing about him (Trump) that's interesting is he does stand-up for white people's interests, although it goes unsaid. That being said, I don't think standing up for white people necessitates hating others or not standing up for them either.

He's against the political correctness which wants to lump people in these groups as though it's the end of the day and the work is done... which ends up having a lot of anti-whiteness to it, and now there's backlash.

"I had a younger black friend that I would play with on Xbox live. Think high school senior age. I was probably around 24 at the time.

He asked me what I thought about ""white privilege"". What it was and wether or not I thought it was real. I thought about it for a good bit (I'm white).

I told him, that in America at least, I didn't really think white privilege was real. Sure you have assholes that say ridiculous things. And hell maybe even some stores or other businesses still try to segregate, although I haven't seen any. But they can't stop you from living your life. Why do you care what some asshole thinks? Just ignore them. 

If some random guy walks up to you and makes racial remarks, just forget he even exists. If a store won't let you in because of your color, there are plenty of other places that sell the same thing. 

My point is that no one can realistically stop you from living your life the way you want. Sure there are still racists out there. But they are largely outnumbered. The best way to deal with them is to just ignore them and keep living your life. 

As a disclamer though, I'm not talking about police brutality, or acts of violence. Purely the people who have nothing better to do than to say things like that guy said to you.

So in that way, I don't think I have any real advantage over a black person in life. I live in a two bedroom two bathroom house. There was once a black man who lived in the white house."

"&gt; Why can god basically just punch you in the face and say ""well you're the bad guy if you don't just take this and keep loving me?"" How is that even the slightest bit acceptable?

Neither of us could ever possibly hope to understand the thought processes behind an all knowing gods rationale. 

And life isn't about having no issues, issues help us mature as people and help determine who we are. This notion you seem to have that life should essentially just be the exact same as heaven is stupid.

&gt; He doesn't give us a REASON to have faith in the first place.

There's a reason it's called faith. And if you only have ""faith"" in something because it's been proven to you then that isn't faith at all.

If everyone was good just because we all knew and had proof that there was a god then anyone being good really wouldn't mean anything at all, it would just be a way to get into heaven.

And punishing someone for failing a test isn't horseshit at all.

"I'm sick of this fucking excuse.  No, it's not an accent.  It's either ignorance, arrogance or both.

An accent that forces you to pronounce a word wrong isn't a reason to pronounce a word wrong.  It's just pronouncing a word wrong.

If the whole point of language is to be able to communicate with other people, insisting on using an ""accented"" pronunciation is an impediment to communication.  If I can't understand what you are saying to me because of your ""accent"" that's on you, not on me.  What's next, are we going to elevate mispronunciations due to speech impediments into a ""real"" language?"

I find the biggest logic flaw with people protesting eating animals is how they refer to animals as a sentient being. Cows are cows. People are people. A lion or a shark don't contemplate whether the prey wants to live or not. I like meat as well and don't give a fuck about the mental well being of my meal. Unless it effects the flavor.
