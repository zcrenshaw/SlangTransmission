"180 no scope



Edit: why"
"i'm gonna go with 'she was already having an affair, and upon overhearing this,  found her out and left the marriage'.

No way a wife in a typical marriage flips out like that and instantly cheats about an overheard phrase.  "
I mean.. if they're expensive or high quality you probably should file a claim. If the embarrassment is worth the price of buying new ones
"Everyone's talking about the embarrassment of security opening your bag to find your sex toys, but I think once you've taken your sex toys to the airport, they're going to know what you're doing no matter what.  Your bag will go through an X-Ray and they're going to see a pretty clear outline of everything you own on their screen with you standing right in front of them.  I've had security guards jokingly quack at me multiple times when they saw my bag was full of rubber duckies.  There's not much you can do about it.  If it's any consolation, sex toys probably aren't that unusual to them."
"have that checked out, you dont fuck around with eyesight"
"You didn't fuck up at all, you bossed a tricky situation to combine a date and work.

You dodged a train wreck. "
Damn the shower took your virginity
"Not her fault in a way? Naw, totally is. If she was there resting her head on this guy, she's clearly there flirting with him in front of you. She's a twat. Weither she did it purposely or not, she's definitely at fault and not a good friend."
"If I needed to take a shit that badly, you can be damn sure I wouldn't give a fuck if it was a women's or men's bathroom either.

Edit: Hi andy"
Your friend is a bitch
Oh my god. I can’t imagine doing the rest of the trip while being known as “the guy who projectile diarrhea’d all over Susan”
"Yeah, she was already cheating and looking for a way to blame him to ease her guilt. 

But cheating at connect four???  Fuck him!! Lol"

What the fu---ohhhhhhh!"
"""Look what you made me do!""... Six months ago"
"Along with those yelling to go see a doctor I'll also interject that you need to file an accident/injury report with your employer asap (Usually 48hrs from the accident). It may seem silly for a paper cut but this ought to be covered by their insurance not yours (though IANAL). Having a report on file would be especially important if there were any complications further down the road, no paper trail=no proof if the worst were to happen."
"Haha, I just can't stop thinking of how horrible this must have been from her perspective. 

Imagine being tired and sick, in a foreign country, and you just barely made it to the toilet, in the middle of a dark, rainy night. You're peeing out of your ass you're so sick, but you can finally relax a bit because at least you're over the toilet. Maybe you even lean your head back and close your eyes, taking a deep, calming breath. Your mouth gently falls open as you begin to lightly doze off.

Suddenly, out of nowhere, *pat pat pat pat pat-* quick, urgent footsteps approaching. Right as your mind makes the connection that someone's about to open the door, you open your eyes, and open your mouth to say something. The door slams open, and you get blasted with diarrhea, like someone took the lid off a blender. 

It's in your mouth. It's in your eyes. It's in your hair, and all over your clothes. You already didn't feel clean, because you just had filthy diarrhea, but now you're covered in someone elses. You can taste it. It tastes exactly like what you always imagined diarrhea would taste like. You want to throw up, but you already threw everything up. You gag, as you wipe shit off of your eyes.

Standing before you, with eyes wide as saucers, is your boss. With his pants down. You scream, but not loud enough to drown out the horror of what just happened. 

Edit 1:

A couple people have asked about when I shit in the library:

So, I have Crohns. I went undiagnosed for like a year and a half. Basically, for a year and a half, I literally had (and I mean literally) diarrhea 8-12 times per day. I know most people reading that will be like ""VAT DEFUQ!? HOW DID YOU NOT KNOW SUMTHING VAS WRONG!?"" And, tbh, it's hard to explain. It's sort of like how abuse victims eventually accept their abuse as the new norm?

It started as just urgent poops, and eventually, over the course of a few months escalated to nonstop buttpiss. I mean the kind where you scramble to find a bathroom, and it feels like there's magma churning in your gut. And then you shit, and it sounds like someone just turned on a faucet. 

Anyways, I basically adapted to my new norm, and was able to cope with it, so I didn't go to the doctor for about six months. There was also probably a little bit of fear that I was dying, if I'm honest. It was a dark time, but eventually i went to the doctor. It took them forever to figure our what was wrong with me. Like, 6+ months. They thought I had anything from parasites, to H Pilori infection, to C Diff. At one point, I was on a cocktail of drugs for a month that was so bad I'd occassionally just barf. 

Anyways, one of my doctors even tried to say, ""well, I think you're just anxious."" And I was like..... ""uh YEAH, NO SHIT! I'M LIABLE TO SHIT MY PANTS ANY TIME, AND I JUST GOT SOME POOP ON MY MOM'S NEW COUCH CUSHION!?"" (I cleaned it off, but still. That was the moment I knew something was horribly, horribly wrong.)

So, eventually he sent me to a Gastrointestinal doctor, which, idk why he didn't right off the bat, but the gastro was all like ""drink this stuff, it'll give you diarrhea, and I'll stick a camera up your butt."" And I was like, ""hey dude, I prob don't need the stuff, cause diarrhea is my natural state, nahmsain.""

Anyways, that's way off track, but provides some context. My point was, I had a disease and didn't know, and also I'd just like to say, I only ever had three accidents.

The first is when I accidentally shit my pants on my mom's couch. Sharts are much more dangerous with watery diarrhea, for obvious reasons, and I sharted, big time. Spoiled my pants, but got a small spot on the couch as well. The second time was in the mall. I had just drank some tea (caffeine gets things moving) and couldn't find the fucking bathroom (which btw, they had ONE FUCKING BATHROOM in the entire mall...). So I was just some crazy guy doing the butt-clench-sprints through the mall, yelling at random people, asking urgently where the bathroom was. Like, my tone was that of a frantic mother who'd lost her child. I made it that time, but it was close.

The third time was at the lib. Whoof. Well, first of all, I worked there. And second of all, it was before I was diagnosed and treated (mostly all better now, fwiw). Anyways, I was stocking books and all of all sudden it hit me hard and fast. The bathroom was a mere ~25 feet away, but I honestly didn't know if I could make it. Not knowing whether you're going to explosively shit your pants in front of a bunch of people does something to a man, I'll tell you that damn much. 

So, I sort of run/waddled toward the bathroom as fast as i could. Worth noting, was that this was the library's second bathroom- the other was a full, multiperson one in like, a designated restroom area. This one, for some bizarre reason, was a single occupant room, right in the middle of the fucking lib. I mean, it literally went from shelves to bathroom. 

All I was concerned with was making it to the bathroom, and it was just like OPs story. I had gotten used to undoing my belt and pants otw to the bathroom to speed things up, and I was literally doing this in the middle of a crowded library, sweat running down my face. The rest was very similar to OP. Made it just in time to pull my pants down at the door, turn, aim, and pray. Didn't close the door, which wad open to the whole library. And, it got everywhere. It was pretty embarrassing, especially because I did the whole audible sigh of relief thing immediately after, without even meaning to. 

Edit 2: Guys, I got paid reddit money for my writing, AMA! ^^Take^that^HS^teachers 

Also, thank you :)

Edit 3: I swear I'll stop after this, but I'm imagining OP's shitsplosion like a gymnast finishing a routine. Like, he ran up to the latrine, jumped in the air, and in one fluid motion, kicked the door open, flung his pants down, and did a 180, and the second his feet hit the ground, that's when he sprayed down his employee. Like, a shitty final flourish. I fucking love this story, OP.  "
"Your friend is not a friend, and Hary is not a gentleman. Potentially two bullets dodged."
oh man. I’m sorry for laughing. you did the right thing though!
"Yup, girl is not a real friend. What a shit move on both their parts. She actively participated in physical contact with him (head on him) in front of you, KNOWING how you felt. I had friends like this in high school and college, but guess what? None of my girls would pull that now because we respect and value our friendships more than some dude's attention. "
Boom head shot 
"I would say he deserves gold, but I think he already showered his girlfriend in it. "
It was less that I didn’t care and more that I completely didn’t notice lol. Just a mad dash.
"The smell of oil and fuel is overwhelming, the wet hand isn't."
"Bored, power-hungry American Cops are cancer.

I guarantee you the airport immediately trashed them as they were considered a biohazard. You'll have to buy new ones.
Do you really want to regret your decision later when you could have prevented further damage/infection?
ER nurse here. The doctors and the nurses definitely did not believe you when you said you “fell in the shower.” 
"I agree with this guy, I've been in a similar situation but I was the ""best friend"" and the girl started chatting me up more than the guy she was supposed to be meeting there, once I noticed it I just shut down and offered zero competition, like a good friend does. Maybe y'all need to have a talk about what is expected inn situations like this."
Do these police have absolutely nothing better to do?
"Forcefully I might add, this could have been a good thing if made with love."

Still it feels shitty to pay for someone's date
"Cops in college towns can be dicks.  I myself was in a fraternity but one of the young-new campus police officers would wait parked outside of the dorms and stop kids that he thought looked drunk as they would try to enter the dorm and give them MIPs. Even if they were driven there by a sober driver. Also, nearly all of the fraternities at my school use a sober driver system so that everyone has to be sober like one or 2 nights a semester for a shift so that there is a driver 24/7 365. The same cop used to pull over sober driver cars intentionally and then breathalyze every passenger and if they were under 21, give them a MIP. Dude was a fuck so all the presidents of all the fraternities wrote to the head of campus police and the school and said we'd expell our sober driver systems if this officer didn't quit harassing students that were partying in a safe fashion. It ended up working and I'm pretty sure he got fired eventually."
"Yeah, absolutely - but this just shows she was super happy to walk over people to get what she wants, its a perfect example. 

She was not the one for you, OP, and that doesn't sound like a fuck up in this case."
At least you didn't shit into their laps in the middle of the Brazilian rainforest.
She is not your friend.
"At this school, I honestly believe busting college kids was what they did for fun. Later that same year I heard of a big party getting busted by, get this, ~40 cops. They lined up everyone and had rows of cops with tickets ready. You went down the line and got your ticket before being sent home. At least they didn't get arrested though....

Also heard they basically calling a S.W.A.T. team/National Guard to ""protect the town"" during springfest or some known big party event. They had spotters on roofs calling out overly drunk kids/packed parties.

Lame. as. fack."
"Jeez, I can't believe I did this to her..."
"""Why are your suitcases full of ducks?""

""I don't tell you how to live your life."""
Quel dommage. It was sneaky to use une amie. I wouldn't say you're the dumb one. Wtf is wrong with people? 
"Wonder if the doctor believed you. “Yea sure, slipped in the shower and got penetrated. Never knew people actually tried to use that excuse”"
"Can you imagine your party story being ""let me tell you about the time I was shit on at 2 am in a German church in the middle of the Brazilian forest""?"
"You’re a dumbass, you know that?"
"At least one of them didn’t end up getting caught in the conveyor, jamming it and causing maintenance to come out to fix it leading them to start waving a mangled dildo in the air loudly asking “who is responsible for this?” while looking accusatively in your general direction as you discreetly try to gather your intimate underthings under the gaze of a score of irate passengers waiting for their now indefinitely delayed luggage. 

Just saying. "
"Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor. But ... every once in a while [looks around, leans in conspiratorially] ... it's a dildo. [leans back] Of course, it's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. We have to use the indefinite article, ""a dildo"", never ... your dildo."
I kinda wanted to hear that tifu more.
"Trust me, it was bad."

"That means your friend gave him her number. I would have said it was all on him, but I think she’s just a shitty friend. I also think it’s weird she took you up on the offer to come along. A good pal would send you off for your date and see you another day."
Yeah that is the worst part of the story... Using the feminine form of friends was such a big lie for only 2 letters....
"I’m a paramedic and it’s seriously an excuse used pretty frequently for objects that find their way in someone’s rear.   In 20 years I’ve heard the “slipped in the shower” line probably 4 or 5 times.  ALWAYS a dude too. 

One of them told me he slipped but could not come up with any excuse for why he had the TV remote in the shower...

Mix them all in a small tub and scrub your stinky self. Then shower it off. This worked for my dog long ago and tomato juice is a myth. "

"My story got too long. Basically because the wheels rub the underside of the deck if I hit a hard bump, and travel over 30, it took me a ton of time to drive 12 miles. So I got home late, in the dark and didn’t put the trailer away properly.  

If I had put the trailer away and driven the 30 feet back to my normal parking spot, I wouldn’t have gotten stuck. "

"That’s the original meaning...originated in medieval Scotland when buckets were used for toilets.  Each evening, the buckets would be dumped from the flat windows (apartments), into the street drainage.

"My best friend put a novelty vibrator in my hand luggage ( it was novelty, so tiny and cheap it wouldn’t be worth using!) the trip in question was to fly home with my one year old daughter and my husband after celebrating my daughters first birthday. 

Loaded down with presents and kids stuff, at the airport my husband take my daughter and goes through the security checkpoint and I go through the longer line for people with stuff to have scanned. I notice the staff are laughing and then they stop me at the end of the conveyor belt. Apparently ‘something’ in may bag was moving and making noise. I think “one of the birthday present toys” and open the bag and pull it out. As I die of embarrassment I realize my extended family including my grandma are all watching. Security staff are dying of laughter, my husband is laughing on the other side of the barrier and I make a mental note to kill my best friend. "

"Yeah, if she was in any way aware that this was a kinda date thing, she should've either not joined, or if joining was all she could do, talked her friend up and helped her out. Now, she just sniped a guy from her friend, and that's just a shitty thing to do. Friendships have ended over less, and I think OP should tell her friend the truth of how she feels, and if her friend doesn't basically immediately apologise (because misunderstandings do happen) that friendship should be dead to OP."

But then she started giving me a hand job and things were going good and then suddenly her grandpa walked in. I threw a pillow real quick over my dick and she was still holding it to try to not make a bunch of quick movements so he wasn't suspicious. Then he asked ""You guys hungry? Lets go grab something to eat."" So he stood there waiting for us to get up. She got up and went to the bathroom real quick and he turned his head looking for his keys and in that split second I pulled my pants up. To this day that's the fastest I have ever pulled up my pants."

"I went to a big state school in a little town in a rural area. Your classic college town. 

The local police force vigorously enforced alcohol laws. Turns out, writing thousands of citations with accompanying fines for underage drinking is a steady source of income for a cash strapped local government. 

This town wasn't particularly nice or safe either. Break-ins/property crimes against students, particularly over the winter break, were rampant. Students that lived off campus in rental homes that weren't savvy enough to bring their personal possessions back to their parents house over winter break were crime victims. The police never bothered with those crimes, because there was no money in it. 

If challenged in court, the local PD would lie so as to obtain guilty verdicts. I didn't know it at the time, but the PD also committed too many civil rights violations to even list. Lying, trespassing, you name it.

"If that's the shit she pulls when she hears her husbands friend make an offhand comment about cheating, I'd say your mate has dodged a bullet.

That's a huge difference, and one I'm not sure you are factoring in.

"Sorry, I just want to clear something up in case people are being put off volunteering for clinical trials - asking for healthy adults is the normal second stage of a drug trial, after animal testing to be as sure as possible that the drug is safe. You want to test a drug on healthy people before sick people to see that they stay healthy - it is easier to spot a healthy person becoming sick than a sick person becoming sicker. If the researchers are expecting your body to “go through some shit” in a trial, they will make it very clear beforehand (and your compensation will probably be a fair bit higher), otherwise it’s just a standard step on the road to a drug being approved for clinical use and they’re not expecting you to experience more discomfort than you would find using any currently prescribed drug. If people stop volunteering for these trials, the exciting new drugs that you hear about on the news will never be approved. "

Took antibiotics, 100mg a day but I read it wrong and took 2/day. Fucked up digestion big time... Made my colon a wasteland. Lost 15LBS by squirting for a month. BUT, it incredibly cured an issue I had for years with my pancreas. Reactive hypoglycemia... Blood sugar drops after eating instead of rising. Had to be careful what I ate and how much. Completely gone now. Blood sugar normal and I can eat what I want again. WTF. "
"&gt;I walked into a back room where I witnessed three girls. One is pissing in the sink, one is pissing in the corner, and one is pissing in the trashcan. It was at that point I decided it was time to go home.

Sorry, I stopped reading there. Having attended college myself, I am fully aware that this is the time for NOT going home. The party is just starting!"
Spray n’ pray.
"That's a rough day right there, well 2 days."

She also took the dog with her. She says she didn’t want my stink rubbing off on the dog. 
"You *need* to see a doctor. I once got an eye infection from a string just touching my eye, I can't imagine something penetrating it."
"As I sit on the toilet reading this, I feel a sense of privilege sitting on my white ceramic throne"
"Once a child was skipping rocks next to me. A rock flew out of her hand sideways and hit me directly in the eye. My eye doesn’t focus properly anymore. 

I didn’t go to the doctor for days since everything seemed fine. 

Go to the ER. The bill is worth it. "
The importance of well fitting shoes cannot be understated here.
Shittymorph still gets me every time
"Just buy new ones, unless they were super expensive. You’ll have momentary embarrassment when you go to get them, but you’ll never have to see those people ever again. So it’s fine, I guess."
Roll tide
And the guy is a bit of an insensitive prick too.
Sounds like they might have known who did leak the photo and were looking for a fall guy.
"Tip for next time- don't try to directly fight riptide, swim closer to parallel to the beach to break free. "
"In english sometimes ""friend"" means ""guy I am fucking"". At least the gendered languages forces her to lie. "
My foot luckily crushed it to death first
God damn. This made my nose itch and feel weird. Crazy story 
This has to be an April fool's post because there's no way that a person can be this dumb
UNWISE DESCISION
"That was kind of you to help, most people probably wouldn't. Also, your wife's reaction cracked me up. "
