"How unconfident about their bodies they can be, and the bizarre stuff they’re insecure over.

Ive had two separate women *apologize* to me for having pubic hair :/

My SO feels like the backs of her hands are unattractive.

And don’t even get me started on how insecure about their boobs they get.

They’re worrying over them being too big, too small, too assymetrical, having overly prominent nipples, having inverted nipples, stretch marks, sag.

Meanwhile, I’m like “Oh shit, it’s tits!”"
"That most women can't orgasm from penetration alone. It was like that feeling when fighting sister friede in dark souls 3 for the first time. You think you finished her off and think ""oh it's not that hard"" but then it turns out she's got 2 more health bars to go through and you're already 2/3 through your estus flask chugs. "
"Some men have never gotten a compliment on their looks, not even from a family member. 

Some men have never gotten unsolicited attention, or have had people actually avert their eyes. 

Some men just get told flat-out that they're ugly. 

Pair any of that with the common portrayal of male attractiveness, plus the comments some women make about men of certain heights, races, builds, etc. and it's easy to see why a man who doesn't fit that criteria would feel ugly. "
"Very attractive and a good kind of weird.

There's something about the physical feeling of paper that you don't get with digital photos on your phone and it feels a lot more intimate, at least to me. It's quite the surprise."

I find a woman and then I make friends with her like I would a guy
"It’s weird because the role is usually guys make the first move or initiate some sort of conversation when they find a woman attractive. When you’re a good looking guy, more gay guys hit on you than women......it’s such a cosmic joke fml. "
"Hoe this counts. 

My husband spent 15 years in the military. No one but me called him by his first name. 

Once, I couldn't wake him up one morning no matter what I did. In a flash of brilliance, I called him by his last name. He shot right up.

To this day, if I need his immediate attention, I call him by his last name. The military trained him well. "
"I can't stand when I hear guys talking about how long to wait when calling/texting someone back. Like, it's 2018, everyone is on their phones all the time, who fucking cares. If you want to text her, just do it."

"-Hey, wanna go out sometimes? 

-Oh I'm sorry, I only see you as a friend...

"I did the same. Doctor said "" don't worry I'll put them back""."
"My wife calls me by my first name or ""Dear,"" the latter being with a varying amount of sarcasm / condescension.

In the military, I was ""Booty"" due to a sergeant who couldn't pronounce my actual last name. My wife hates this, and she hates it even more that military acquaintances refer to us as ""the Booties."""
"When i first saw a girl naked in person i thought she looked so weird. Years of seeing my male body made it so when i saw her there with just nothing between her legs, she looked like an alien or something to me. Honestly, i still think naked girls look somewhat alien. Also there is a large bulge above their crotch which i never knew about. "
"We don't get compliments as much as we get girls trying to flirt. It's cute if you're single, but a real pain in the ass if you're in a relationship. "
"I think it was either Chris rock or Dave Chappelle that said it best. 

""Guys, we see our friend's awesome girl and want one *just like that.*""

Girls, they see their friends awesome man and think, ""*I want HIM. Fuck that bitch I'm so much better for him.*"""
It was a lot further down than I thought it would be.

"I'd love to say I do healthy things like go to the gym, write poetry or play beautiful music - but to be completely honest when that happens I sit and simmer, questioning all of my values and taking my mind apart piece by agonising piece trying to work out whether it's my fault and whether I can fix it. In the end I simmer so much I end up cooked and then I go numb until the whole thing passes and I'm ready to stand up and take life's next right hook in my jaw."
"""Just be yourself."" At its heart, it's good advice; you shouldn't pretend to be someone else because you want someone to like you for who you are. Unfortunately, a lot of people use this advice as some kind of reason to never improve themselves or to justify a feeling of entitlement for attention. Should really be ""Be the best version of yourself."""

"Nah man I watched like 90 percent of the whole C-section thinking ""this shit is so cool...""

"I don't go by my last name, but I do have a nickname that is very commonly used by a lot of my friends. My (now) wife started off as a friend, so when we first met she used the same nickname as everyone else, but when we got into a relationship, I asked her to use my actual name instead. Took her a bit to adjust, but she did.

It's just a tonal thing for me.  I have no problems with my nickname, I'm rather fond of it, but it has a ""buddy"" feel to it, it's not something I want to hear from a loved one during an intimate moment, that would make me feel super weird."

"Experiencing all the shitty teenage romance. I never had it and feel like I missed out on something many people do in their lives but I never got around to have it. Yeah, it would've probably not meant anything in the long run, sex would've been bad and whatever, but at least I could have experience."
"How damned different each woman is about what they like. Some like no clit stimulation, some love it. Some can't get off without a vibrator, one could get off just by me dancing my fingers around her belly button.

I'm not complaining, because I find the hunt for what gets her off more enjoyable for me. "

"We don't get hit on like guys would on a woman. Only gay guys try to hit on us. Interested women will try to be around you all the time and smile. But they won't make the move, they will wait for you to approach them and quite often it is really hard to detect if you don't pay attention how many times you “run into“ a girl because they play it down all the time. When i got together with a girl they often told me afterwards that they where sticking around me for me to notice and i didn't even realize it. I mean am i supposed to have an internal radar wether a woman is trying to hit on me or just friendly? Because they act the same in both cases. But boy do they complain if someone mistakes their friendliness for flirting.... It's a different game online in social media. You get texted out of the blue by women pretty often. They have more courage online."
"Most men are considered ugly. I forgot the source, but it's something like most women consider 80% of men to below average. "

1. The variation in how a vagina could look was a shock
2. That girl's had a clit and that it felt good when it was rubbed
3. The little spot above a girl's butt as it leads up to their back... so fucking sexy
4. How truly wonderful being inside of a pussy felt
5. That they had just as much hair as we do down there"

"When I met my dude, I was sharing a studio with a guy that has the same first name as him.

Grew up in a fairly conservative home. I didn't know what a vagina was until my sister was born when I was 7. I thought they all had boobs and a penis until then. 
"That's pretty normal. Your parents are people, just like everyone else. They're screwups, they've got plenty of issues, but honestly, most of us are.

My father is awful with relationships. He like to live life on autopilot, without having to think. He's adopted a fatalistic view of the world given the last fifteen or so years of politics, which effectively killed any hopes and dreams he has for the future. He struggles to maintain a steady job because what he likes to do has no job security, and he only wants to do what he likes to do.

My mother is extremely bitter. She remembers slights against her for years, and has trouble forgiving. She doesn't trust men in general (she didn't grow up with many men in her life until she met my dad and what ones she had were shitheads), and she has an inordinate amount of trouble admitting that she is wrong about anything. She's a pack rat and a terrible housekeeper.

But damn, my dad is willing to work hard, especially if it's a project for his wife or my sisters or me. He's competent with almost any tool, and has mostly been able to keep his head above water with all the new tech. He's smart when he decides to think about things, and he's a huge believer in 'trust, but verify.'

My mom is one of the most giving people you will ever meet. She'll help you out beyond what you asked for, and she's great at getting you to slow the fuck down and look at the big picture. She's great at seeing potential issues in your plans, and she'll do research for days if it means she'll get the best bang for her buck. She's an amazing cook, and loves to find new recipes and ways of preparing food so that even though we always bought cheap ingredients, our food never tasted cheap.

My parents are not perfect. They have all sorts of issues, and they made a ton of mistakes when raising me, some of which I am still recovering from. But they did a ton of things right. They still do a ton of things right, and it's easy to overlook those things. I love my mom and my dad, despite their many faults, because they did a ton for me and sacrificed for me, and even as an adult I still find things to like about them and things they do that I look up to them for."

"My psychologist taught me to:

* Go to my room
* (Optional:) Play relaxing music
* Make the room dark (close the door/turn off lights/cover windows)
* Set a timer for 20 minutes
* Lay in my bed and get in a comfortable position.
* Close my eyes and let my mind wander or do whatever it does. It's okay to fall asleep.
* Get up after 20 minutes

At first I was skeptical of this advice, but it works and it's helped me a lot with my anxiety and depression. It feels as if I restart my brain like a computer. "

"This is so true. A friend explained this to me a while back and it stuck with me. Women see single men as an unfurnished apartment. I looks nice but takes a lot of work to get it where you want it. But they see taken men as an already fully furnished house. Turn-key, in you will. They're well established and have everything in a nice working order already. And that is more appealing. 

I can vouch for being an attractive guy that gets flirted with way more being in a relationship than when I was single. "

"I have a friend who will reflexively give a random nugget of advice, without really considering the situation. This leads to conversations like:

"Those insecurities usually come from something their ex boyfriends said to them before. For example my ex would always point out big boobed girls on the street, he would watch porn that exclusively had them and he'd always remind me how mine are too small to look like ""woman's"". He got super excited when I told him that I was considering augmentation. Surprise surprise, now I am super insecure about my breasts. Just like how short guys or guys with a small penis develop an inferiority complex about their bodies after being rejected because of them."

"If we've had conversations about whether we want to have sex while intoxicated ahead of time and I'm comfortable that we're within those bounds, it's fine with me. Depending on what you mean by pretty damn drunk, I might pass, just because my partners have been really lousy at sex while highly intoxicated. And there are certain points of intoxication that my partners have not been comfortable having sex at, so really drunk might violate the prearranged consent. "
"There is no way to describe the feeling of getting hit in the balls. Often it doesn't hurt at all for the first 30 seconds or so. They it rapidly intensifies unlike any other pain I have ever felt.

"The little pocket thing is most common in underwear that’s not made of cotton, but the material they sew in that has most contact with the vagina is cotton - it’s more breathable and better for health reasons as well.

"women's bodies are pretty insane man, they do so much shit, its crazy and fascinating and it always wows me.  
Like as men the only thing we do is make sperm and provide that to make a baby and then overall just your overall human functions.  
A woman's body, however, is like a ""hold my beer"" and proceeds to do ALL of the above (minus the sperm part) and on top of that, create life inside of them, nurture that issh for 9 months (I can't even imagine the feeling of having a living creature inside of me, feeling it move and shit, like an alien movie),  push that out, and then afterwards, having the ability to make organic food (milk) long enough for a tiny human being to grow healthy.  
That shit blows my mind,man, it's nuts, and i definitely give props to women to go thru all this shit. No offense to women, but I am DEFINITELY happy I am a man.  
With that said, vaginas are insane.  
They're self cleaning, self-balancing, self-lubricating, come in all shapes, profiles, and sizes, are malleable, and they literally have one organ (the clit) PURELY for pleasure purposes, nothing else.  
Whoever created us was probably like ""you know what, we put a lot of shit into this creature let's give them something to have fun with to offset the more or less overwhelming parts""  
The only cool thing about a man is how we can make unlimited amounts of sperm throughout our lives while women are born with a set amount of eggs that they will use/have access to for their lifetime.  
Biology is on some crazy shit.

After sex he pulls out and as expected there is a little bit of blood but nothing alarming. My ex starts freaking out thinking he hurt me or something, I had to explain to him that it was just normal period blood and not even that much. Apparently he thought that when women were on their periods only little drops of blood would come out and that was it. Every month after that he was incredibly sweet to me during my period. "
"How shit periods are. 

I’ve said I would like to experience what it’s like to have a period but honestly I don’t think it’s worth it.

Then there’s the pretending like nothing’s wrong when I know she is in agony, for instance at social gatherings that are unavoidable or planned months in advance.

"When people try to unriddle ""amazing in bed"" they often think of technicalities like who lasted how long and who screamed how loudly or ""special moves"". 

In my experience, all of that is bunk.

The things that really make someone ""amazing"" in bed is how attentive and generous she is, how well she reads me intuitively (&lt;empathy), how creative and vivid an imagination she has, how gentle she is, how generous she is, and how much she is in love and lust with me, how much of the initiative she takes and how pushy she is about wanting to make me feel good. So, what she ""does"" with and to me is just an expression, a symptom as it were of who she *is*.

And therefore, many things a woman does that give me that feeling of amazement are small taken by themselves: The way she *always* knows with pinpoint accuracy when I'm exactly at the cusp of coming and *always* encourages me to cum for her in a way that's irresistible. The way she always knows when I really need the closest of close contact and will proactively smoosh me against her. The way she'll slip her fingertip under my foreskin and play with my glans when I'm still slippery with her wetness after sex, while we're making out in the afterglow. Lots and lots of tiny things - more than I have the time to describe here.

And in sum, these tiny things then lead to very great things: Her being able to push my buttons effortlessly. Her teaching me things, so to speak, about my own body I myself didn't know. And a feeling of extreme closeness and intimacy, because you feel like you know and own each other truly, without reservation.

That's what makes a woman amazing in bed, not blowjob technique this or squirting that."

"I mean, there are obviously individual circumstances, but in general: media, adverts, programmes, cartoons - depictions of women with VERY specific body shapes and features, so many products and adverts to do with having to hide things or women being embarassed about their bodies or women needing to lose weight. Kids being taught that clothes matter and our worth lies in our physical appearance. Where messages are not explicit, they are often there implicitly.

For me specifically, on top of that all of the other girls in my childhood and teens who bullied me for not looking a particular way.

Men apparently find me incredibly attractive/hot/gorgeous/whatever, and I'm learning to create my own worth, but I still have issues sometimes or do things as ridiculous as apologise for not being completely hairless in X zone of my body/not wearing makeup.

I guess we point out the negatives out of some mindset where we don't want you to think that we're so careless as to NOT realise how shitty our bodies are (even if they aren't), or that we didn't groom X part of the body this morning (even if neither of us particularly care). Some of us would probably like reassurance that you see something good in us (and some of us will receive that reassurance terribly, but some of us will listen).

I guess the equivalent of this is men being bombarded with imagery regarding being competitive/guzzling protein/working out/having suits and nice cars/making money, but as I'm not a man I can't speak from the personal experience of having been targeted by men's products."

"Once you're in an established sexual relationship consent can be a little more blurry.  Once trust is established nonexplicit/nonverbal consent can become normal.  There's nothing wrong with enjoying drunk sex, and maybe she trusts you not to take advantage of her.  

If it really bothers you, talk it out when you're both sober.  

In my relationship - I've been with my wife over twenty years - if she initiates while drunk and I'm up for it, we'll have sex.  If I'm drunk and initiate and she's up for it, we'll have sex.  It's not remotely controversial.  "

Couldn't this effect of being taken and being seen as more attractive be attributed to the generally more confident way a man holds himself when he's getting everything from a relationship that he needs?  It's no secret that people are attracted to confidence, man or woman. 

Basically, I think that the reasoning behind the effect isn't so much ""He's taken"" but more so ""He seems happy and confident in himself, I find that attractive."""

I was also wound up pretty tight, and she taught me to just chill the fuck out and take the time to enjoy life every once in a while. Whereas I was all about competition and winning, she was all about kindness and generosity. She taught me a ton about life and showed me the world in a way that I had never imagined it was.

There was actually a post in /r/legaladvice recently about a kid who did everything right when an older women was soliciting him for sex and reported it, but the police and his parents just scoffed and/or laughed at him.

If you are a man regardless of the type of cancer you have, if you are going to undergo chemo and/or radiation therapy, they have you ""bank"" your sperm.  That is for all cancer types, it applies to *every male* going through chemo!  That said, my brother was told he could never ""naturally"" have kids so he and his monogamous wife didn't bother to use protection....  Well turns out his sperm grew back and she got pregnant with twins!!  "
I think you're right about this. I have a thin waist but large hips. I am also on the taller side (just over 5'10). My ex similarly had a weird obsession with showing me tiny women and telling me about how only smaller women are feminine. For the longest time I confused my larger hips for being fat and masculine. It wasnt until after hours committed to the gym without being able to lose an inch that I realized it's bone... and perfectly normal.

"This. A lot of men here seem to think being ugly means people are screaming at you in the streets, telling you to hide your face, etc. Oftentimes it's not that dramatic, oftentimes it's a more insidious passive attitude from society.

Things like: let's say you really work on improving yourself, get good photos, develop a personality+hobbies, and then get on Tinder excitedly. 1 month goes by... you have 1 match. And that 1 match is an extremely obese mother-of-two who takes greasy bathroom selfies and can't spell simple words. At first you're frustrated that this is all you get, that no girl who's at least decent is interested in you and you don't know why.

But then you begin to realize there's a reason you're only attracting these women despite maximizing your looks... and that reason is *this is your ceiling*. You two are equal and in the same inherent league. Think about the way most men would feel about the prospect of getting sexual with a 300lb angry looking single mother - that's how girls feel about you. That's when your ugly status is truly confirmed."

"According to Gabriel Morton (mini YouTube celebrity and Lord Yahtz-sama's nonhomosexual homosexual life partner, who was a bouncer for a long time);

Bouncing is all about physical presence... women would probably use the term ""intimidation"" but men wouldn't really see it that way... anyway, he said that the vast majority of situations could be resolved without any sort of violence or even physical contact as long as you stood your ground and told them to move along. Confident and firm without escalating.

He also  said that if anyone insisted he would fuck with them in,  say, if a drunk guy insisted on staying inside, he would offer them a chance to do so if he could repeat a simple tongue twister....at which point he would say this insanely impossible tongue twister.....

Apparently drunks regularly tried this but gave up like 3 syllables in before saying fuck it and walking away lol."

Now if a woman approaches me or something, my response is to check my back pocket to be sure my wallet is still there.

"In High school, I went by the nickname ""Chill"". It was a contraction of my real last name and almost everyone(classmates, teacher's, friend's parents) except for my parents called by it.

But whenever I would start hooking up with a girl, she would ask if she could call me by my first name. I assumed these girls didn't want to admit to themselves or others they were hooking up with a dude who called himself ""Chill"".

My first serious girlfriend was a girl who had been a friend of mine for years and had been calling me ""Chill"" since we met. When we got together, she also didn't want to call me Chill, but it felt very weird for us both to start using my actual first name. 

I don't really blame her.
Could you imagine saying ""I love you, Chill""  sincerely? 

So she just stopped using my name. If she was talking to other people, she referred to me by my nickname,  but basically didn't refer to me by name to my face for YEARS. 

I can only imagine what our wedding vows would have been like.

"Interesting science fact: Female humans are people too, and will engage in positive reciprocal social interactions with other people they enjoy spending time with.

I swear most of the questions here belong on a sub devoted to questions aliens have for earthlings.

Edit: I just realized I didn't answer the question. To be honest there is no real method to deliberately curate the demographics of your social circles that is both effective and not creepy. As soon as you start viewing your friends for their demographics, they stop actually being your friends and just turn into tokens for you.

You'll either make friends with women naturally through mutual contacts or at events where you just happen to talk to someone or you won't, it's not really something you have a lot of control over. You can choose who you connect with, but you can't choose who connects with you.

Personally I only have a small circle of friends, maybe a third of them are women, but I never really think about it. Don't worry about making friends and you'll probably make more of them. "

If they stand close, make a lot of physical contact, make a lot of eye contact, smile often, laugh often, and maintain an open posture and body language, they're probably interested. They're a lot less likely to overtly make a move on you; rather, they try to make themselves close and available so that you will make a move on them."

"...sometimes we really don't want to have sex, contrary to popular belief.  Especially those of us that are on a serious workout plans, and cutting calories to lose bodyfat.  That shit decreases the libido big time.  It's an annoying double standard, when men are seen as sex crazed lunatics for wanting action from their SO, if she's not in the mood, but men are seen as unmanly for turning down/not wanting sex.  Women get SUPER fucking salty and offended when you turn them down for sex.  It's not personal, no we don't think you've gotten fat, no it's not cause we don't find you hot anymore, yes it's because I worked 60/hrs this week due to it being crunch time for an office project + having ripped out reps of deadlifts/squats with heavy ass weight on a caloric deficit...

"She could make me feel like I was the only man in the world with just a look. Always asked questions about topics she was curious about. Wasn't afraid to have incredible discussions on any subject. Always said good morning and goodnight to me every single day. Made me feel welcome in her home, as if I had been part of the family all her life. Always praised my accomplishments and pushed me to be the best version of myself I could be. Loved travelling and was extremely passionate about anything she put herself towards. Was an absolute goddess in the bedroom.

"My mother used to compare my sister and me to each other. My sister was the ""pretty"" one or the ""thin"" one or the ""graceful"" one. I can't ever remember my mother complimenting my physical appearance. I wasn't tall and thin. I didn't have big boobs and I couldn't dance for shit. As far as my mother was concerned, there was nothing redeeming about my physical appearance. That's just one example of where this all comes from. And just to be clear, I wasn't fat. I was just short and pear shaped and I didn't like ballet classes, I preferred sports and Girl Scouts. My mother didn't know how to fit me and my interests into her narrow notion of femininity and so insulted me for it.

edit: incorrect use of the personal pronoun"
God damn that would make me nut instantly.
Yea... she wasn't fucking you in her head...
Women hate their bellies. Bellies are awesome. 
"Well yeah


But it's not ""do you want to do dinner"".

It's all this obsequious plausible deniability, but it weighs down with social pressure. 

Some girls just put, and I mean *physical place themselves* in your way all the time.

Some of the few worst get bitchy and will start trying to lay a sort of social claim, ruining casual interactions with others.

Many, thankfully ime, do a bit of both. They're always finding ways to be present and unfortunately drop hints constantly that are qualifiers for themselves or insults to perceived competition.

Regardless, I'm doing my shit. Leave me alone. I'll find *you*. Just take the hint. At least don't do it at work.

Anyone else is welcome to correct me, but in my history, girls who really want you don't 'hit on' you the way guys do, so much as make themselves available, try to stand out, and try to curb competition. They still wait for you to make the big move. (I'm saying this as an in general, of course there are exceptions, I don't fucking care about them in this context. They're so uncommon it doesn't really matter to giving advice.)

Additionally, something needs to be done to stop the pure venom that drips from otherwise very nice women, when they realize you're off the market or think they're better than your significant other somehow. (Better for *you*, as if they'd know.) Tbf, guys do this too, but it's so less common.

To be clear, I do prefer when a woman is blunt. ""Hey you're really cute, are you single?""

"I grew up Catholic (agnostic now) and we had to do CCD (catachism).  There was a 20ish year old nun teaching one of the classes.  She didn't wear all the garb that you typically think of, she didn't wear anything on her head, but she did wear a black robe/dress thing.  She kept her hair in a tight braid but her figure was obvious.  CCD was taught after school late into the evening so by the time you get out it is dark outside.  I remember the night it happened.  I had had a full day of school and we had played football at PE.  She was at the board going on and on about Leviticus and I slyly placed my right hand under my chin and propped my right elbow on the window sill.  We made eye contact and she sort of acknowledged me leaning on my elbow, which was not allowed in CCD, you had to sit up straight and not lean on the wall or lay back.  But she could tell I wasn't a boy who followed all the rules.  She saw me breaking a rule, in the back of the class but she didn't correct me, I was her little delinquent and this was odd as I had seen her correct all the other kids who did this.  Apparently to her I was different or special.  Well as you can expect I fell asleep leaning on my arm and she came over slyly and pushed my hand out from under me and berated me in front of the whole class.  She had given me just enough rope to hang myself, Doesn't matter it didn't last long, I was young and it was my first time napping in CCD, but hey I can honestly say I slept with a nun. "

I kept coming back. For the first couple of times I saw her, it was great. I was the best person she had dated. She said her mother always asked about me. Even her dad asked, and he had never shown any interest. 

But after awhile the relationship stagnated. Distance was still a problem. Neither one of us was moving to be with the other. My atheism was also a deal breaker for her. We had the same problems as before. 

Gradually, she started pushing me away. She would tell me she loved me but wasn’t in love with me. It was soul crushing. I would cry on the way home after I left her house. I didn’t understand what I was doing wrong. 

I kept finding reasons to see her: hiking in the mountains, fixing her computer, helping her with landscaping, fixing her pool filter/pump. She started to feel bad. I was helping her, but we weren’t dating. She didn’t want to take advantage of me and suggested we just try and stay friends. 

We saw each other intermittently for a couple months. It wasn’t working. I wanted more. I made one last desperate attempt the last time I saw her. It failed. Miserably. She didn’t want a relationship. When I left her that day, I told her that I’d always love her, and that I was sure we were meant to be together. She told me still loved me but... blah, blah, blah.

I cut off all contact. It was the only way to move on. It still took four more years and meeting the woman who would become my wife to help me go forward. She commented on a post from my sister-in-law to  congratulate me on social media when we got engaged (I had un-friended her when I cut off contact). I didn’t respond back. I don’t wish her ill or anything like that. In fact, I hope she’s happy. That’s what she wanted for me too. But I don’t feel anything for her now. I couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out "
"""Wow, it's... surprisingly close to the butthole.""

Then

""I can understand how those horror stories come about."""
"We bought a pack of cornettos - I'm not sure of the US equivalent; pre-filled, individually wrapped ice-cream cones.

I gave one to her, then went and got mine out of the freezer.

Mine had, unfortunately, lost its cardboard lid and gone all dried out and icy on top.

I said as much in a dismayed tone, and she said ""aww, never mind. You can have my lid.""

I found out that snakes hibernate for the winter in holes with up to 200 other snakes. Now I’m afraid of putting my foot into one of those holes.
Can’t get rejected if you don’t ask!
"Probably Compilations.

I like the fast-paced nature of compilations, and the variety of girls you get to see in a ten-minute video or whatever.

I don't get bogged down in the introduction, or the foreplay, or just watching one couple get down and dirty, when I could see a compilation of various couples/groups.

"
My place..... now!
"Endorphins. Keep myself looking young. 

I've also made it a habit so not going makes me feel extremely off."
"Had a shitty 2-month teenage romance (no sex), still feel like I missed out. I feel like I have some sort of arrested development in relationships now.

Edit: the no-sex part was for the better, we were too young for that shit at the time. Also I didn’t want to risk getting murdered by her father."
Absolutely nothing. She just laid there and stared at me the whole time. It was my first time and she wasn’t a virgin so I was probably doing something wrong 
"I never get compliments on how I look, I don't even think the few girlfriends iv had ever said I looked nice.

Men don't get compliments "
"Pressuring women to have sex because of blue balls is a dick move, but blue balls are absolutely real. When I was a teenager, I used to make out a lot with my girlfriend and it very often felt like I had a kick in the nuts at some point."
"Might sound a bit banal but don't look in the clubs then. Look in places where you're more likely to find an introvert, like a library, or some quiet place on the campus. Tbh though most introverts I'd imagine actually meet new people through their friends, so that might be something to bear in mind. "
"Can confirm.

Source: girl asked me out this week. said yes because have feelings."
"Oh my god this. As a guy, if a girl doesn't show interest back, in not going to bother looking for a relationship. If you can't make an effort to develop a relationship, then there's no reason for me to try to."
What are you lawyering up for? Pay the ticket and accept the points. If the points are concerning to you then request a plea deal of PBJ in exchange for community service. I've never heard of first-offenders not getting it.
When I was a teenager I thought women put the tampon string in that little pocket.
Am I having a stroke or does this not make any sense?
