"I'm immediately jumping to the conclusion that she's a sex worker, but that's a talk you have to have with her. If it turns out she is indeed one, the fact that she didn't bring it up with you beforehand is the reddest of red flags."
we need a post hospital update!! is she ok? 
He grabbed a knife whilst yelling at my cousin - she's also mid twenties. She called 9-11 and I had to restrain him. Cops arrived and took over but my shoulder was dislocated. It was certainly awful.
"Yes, this stupid insinuation that the parents' age is what caused this boy to be a sociopath depleted some of my sympathy for the OP."

Google tickling as abuse....this is pretty common.  
"Agree with others to work with her to find a balance. My ex BF talked about sex nonstop and was only affectionate in sexual ways. It was a complete turn off because I felt like he didn't care about me in any other way. Sex became a chore because I essentially felt like a prostitute (no $ though...shame). On the other hand, if he didn't touch me sexually for a while, I'd wonder what was wrong and would get worried. I'm not saying you're similar to my ex but just wanted to throw my two cents in here. "
"You sound incredibly selfish and spoiled. You're living rent free and driving a new car they pay for and you're penny pinching over getting your mom dentures? How about you start paying them rent and buy your own car if you find it so distasteful that your family is trying to mooch off you, since you've been mooching off them for 5 years. "
"I see/hear this viewpoint all the time, and just have to say there are exceptions.
Don't get me wrong, in OP's case it's clear as day she should remove herself from the situation and move on. But in more general terms rebounds can turn into something more, I've seen it many times firsthand and had it happen myself. My partner and I were 22 when we met, we were each rebounds for each other, he'd been with a girl he was deeply in love with and they'd broken up, and I'd had my heart broken by someone that I was still utterly, completely obsessed with and living with. What started as mutual rebound eventually turned into intense love and we're still together 10 years later.

OP, this guy doesn't' seem like anything has changed for him in that 7 months. He still feels the same as he did when you first started seeing each other- in love with his ex. You've got to move on, you'll be miserable if you don't."
"Massive red flag homie. 

Only the Sith deal in absolutes

But for real, it's gonna be really hard communicating with someone who can't see nuance. Especially in something as large and complex as gender roles in society."
"There is some truth in what you say in an ideal world, but nobody is expected to act perfectly all the time to diffuse a situation. The BiL, however, is supposed to never resort to violence regardless of the situation. "
"&gt; watched him follow her to, I assume, continue flirting with her

The ex was basically running away from him. Trying to touch and flirt with a girl who wants so little to do with you is just ...  pathetic, tbh."
"What state/country are you in? If it's a no-fault divorce state then it doesn't matter. She can fight it all she wants it's still happening. If you're in a fault based state your case is still awesome because she's at fault for abandonment. I see that she's already terminated parental rights, that was the only thing that worried me about this situation. If you want a divorce you'll get a divorce, don't sweat it. If you want additional advice go ok over to legal advice subs. They'll tell you the same thing I am. "
"Absolutely, this is awful behavior from the therapist. Imagine this same scenario with the genders reversed: ""Your boyfriend is beating you? Try to figure out what you're doing so wrong that makes him beat you"". Disgusting. I'd break up with the girlfriend, but also with this therapist after reporting them to whatever group they're working with.

Sometimes it takes a bit to find a therapist you jive with, so definitely keep it up, just not with this one in particular."

Just imagining the oldest hearing that... :( Dang. That broke my heart.
"&gt; People like this usually fall into two camps 

There's another camp:

Constantly accuse you of things to keep you on the defensive, so you always have to work harder and harder to ""please"" them, and give them more and more control. And, they have the ""excuse"" to punish you, treat you poorly, and abuse you, all because of the things they claim you do. "
I don't get why ppl say this and what response they are hoping for. Chick knows she has got a good bod. Doesn't need creep to tell her.

"Wow. This is my childhood. Right down to it being gymnastics. My dad only paid attention to my brother. Never came to my meets. I'm a 35F now and it has fucked up my relationships with men. And still does to this day. It is SO important to a daughter to have positive and equal attention from her father. It will shape how she deals with men forever, regardless of her sexuality. There are books about this. Do some research, have a big conversation with him, buy some books and keep communicating about it forever. "
[deleted]
"I get what you tried to do, with making those coupons to spice up the bedroom and made them for things she likes. But I think giving that to her as a bday gift wasn't the time.

I can't quite put it into words, but if you guys both agree that the bedroom is getting boring, or that the lack of sex is on her end (her losing libido) then reminding her/bringing up that issue during her bday (no matter how innocent your intentions) is probably what made her have that reaction. 

The arranged game comment could be that now it doesn't feel as spontaneous. I'm guessing that you thought it would play out in two ways:

1. You come home from work, she's dressed all sexy, and she says in a seductive voice ""I want to redeem one of those coupons"" *cue cheesy 90s romance music

2. That you guys are already fooling around and then she whips out one of the coupons and you both get excited and use the coupon.

I'm thinking in her mind it's going to be as least sexy as possible ""I would like to redeem my coupon please""

I also feel that giving her only the coupons as a physical gift wasn't a good move. Not that I think every woman needs to be showered in many or expensive gifts, but not including something that is about her (favorite author, piece of jewelry, concert tickets, new sweater, etc), just kind of comes across as a ""football gift"" (I got this for you, but it's really for me). Even though the coupons are for things she likes, she's probably only seeing it as sex, you're getting sex as HER bday gift.


So basically, you had good intentions, but bad execution imo."

"This is probably what my husband will tell them when he calls them tonight, I hope it's enough to make them understand how uncomfortable it made us. Not really holding my breath though "
"Totally spot on comment!!! Plus I imagine that if your wife is getting depressed because others have kids and she doesn't... she will surely get depressed when she gets kids. Let me repeat, kids are hard work and put a tremendous stress on a relationship. Did I say tremendous? Yes.

We dated 6 years before marriage, we waited another 6 years after marriage to get kids and while I can tell you they are a wonderful addition to your life, I can also tell you than I can trace back and tell you they were the source of the problems that lead us to now divorcing after 15 years of marriage.

My story is not your story but I think you are being wise with your choices. Your wife shouldn't be comparing herself with others. It's your life to live on your terms."
"If I were you, I wouldn't argue with your sister. I'd let her blow up my phone or let her yell at me in the house, and maybe say something like ""maybe you shouldn't have told me to kill myself, then.""  

And that's it. 

Your sister is 18, and still a teenager who will make mistakes. I think she will come to her senses, and realize she has treated you poorly. Hopefully, in the future, she will make an effort to hang out with you, esp as she nears college-age (or full time working age, whatever her future holds). 

Obviously, you did nothing wrong. I understand if you still feel angered, or perhaps sad about this current situation. When things cool down, maybe you can tell her or shoot her a long text message explaining how she's been making you feel, and how you hope you can get closer to her. With the sentimental text/talk, you just might be able to knock some sense into her. 

I hope you have fun at fall formal! It sounds like you're making your brother and his gf very happy to have been asked to be included in helping. "
I'm so afraid she's going to stay with him. Please don't stay with him. 
"I don't think he wants you at all. It's not a question of him settling for you. 

Also the wanting a kid thing. Really?  It seems as if you think you are trained as a caregiver, have some experience, etc. That you should/must have one. 
I would focus on leaving him and getting healthy. "
"Your husband didn't fat shame her. That girl ate you out of house and home, with help from your step daughter. SHE is spreading lies about your husband on social media.

You're backing the wrong horse, OP."
"It's not you or your husband's responsibility to take care of John. Sucks to be John, I'm sure, but you two are the married couple and are part of a team - and that only works if you're in it together. 

""Husband, I'm sure John appreciates all you're trying to do for him, but we have to focus on our family first, and we can't do that if we keep taking on roommates."" Any time your husband tries to argue, put your foot down. ""I'm not going to be convinced. I've made up my mind. John is not our problem."" The only reason he keeps bringing it up is because he's trying to pick away at your decision making regarding it, bringing up more and more counter arguments until you somehow convince yourself it'll be a good idea. You know it's not a good idea, though. John is an adult. He'll be fine. "
"Hey there! Thank you so much for the reply.

Reading through these replies makes me realize I do need to talk to him about triggers. It's not fair for me to leave him in the dark. My big fear is him feeling the need to protect me from everything. I had older friends who completely changed when I told them. They were constantly on guard and asking if I was okay. I don't want him to feel the need to baby me or for him to see me as something that needs to be saved. I am so proud of the person I have become despite my struggles. I'm strong and independent and so proud of myself. It's just going to hurt watching the person I love ask me if I'm okay watching a certain movie or if a branch falling outside is upsetting me. It just makes me feel like a child and not like the bad bitch I am. I just want to feel like I can do everything myself but I also know that's not the point of a relationship. I love him so much and I have to trust him enough to believe he knows me. And, obviously keep the lines of communication really open. 

Woo that was a lot. Really thank you so much for the reply and the brain food"
"Why are you still calling this guy your BF?

Look at how angry and vindictive you are.

1. This has brought out the worst in you.
2. How will you ever be able to trust him again?
     * He is only sorry because you found out
     * Otherwise, he would have kept at it
     * He exposed you to STI risk.
3. How will he ever be able to trust you again
     * You got violent at him
     * Everything you have done and said since is a wound that will erode away at any relationship

There is no going back, it is time to end things.

When you take control of your life and move away from him, you will find the anger dissipate.

---

Some thoughts on anger.

Don't let the anger control and/or define you. Even if your anger is justified, the longer you let it reign, the more it will eat away at who you are.

No matter how angry you are, getting violent about it is NOT ACCEPTABLE. What you did is domestic violence. Before you start excusing yourself by claiming justification or how he is a big strong man and what could a woman do to him, IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

Unless violence is necessary to defend yourself or another, what you did crossed a line.

If this is how you react when angry in general, you need to address that. You will never be able to have a healthy relationship until you can be angry in a controlled, reasonable manner.

If this is the first time, learn from it and don't do it again."
"Sounds like they're jealous and have been talking about you behind your back. There's nothing you can do about it, except grieve and make some better friends. Wait a few months and try reaching out again. "
"How do people ""celebrate"" your anniversary? Are they just saying ""happy anniversary"" or posting it on Facebook? Because they're probably just trying to be nice. It's not their fault that you needlessly did something you don't believe in and it turned out to be expensive and a bit shit. They think your major life event was happy, because weddings are generally happy. Eventually they'll stop giving a shit, and it won't be because they're celebrating the day you and your husband officially became a couple.

If someone congratulates you, say thanks and move on. If I congratulated someone and they told me ""we actually celebrate X date so that's when you should congratulate me"" I can guarantee that I would not file that away for future reference, I'd just be like, ""Um, okay.""

Lastly, you have to let go of your bitterness about the wedding you got. It sucked for you but you don't get a do-over. The day will always exist. 

Do you believe in and care about marriage now and wish you could have a wedding that reflects that? Cool. Wait a few years and make that happen. Do you just want to have a big party, fine have that on whatever day you celebrate. But don't throw people's goodwill back in their faces because three years ago you had a party you didn't quite like."
"And please if she isn't gonna dump him, 'I know and white dudes have these big pretty pink dicks, but you have such a great personality!'"
"THIS x 1000!

She chose YOU, OP. She knew what she was getting into the moment she offered to help you, and she made that decision because she's a big girl who obviously loves you for all the good that she sees in you.
She sounds like a positive influence in your life, and I think you should stick to her like shit on shingles. "
"I want to touch upon something that I haven't seen any of the other commenters talk about.  Yes anal is a pretty common kink, but that doesn't mean that your wife wants or likes it.  Anal can be painful and uncomfortable and a lot of women just don't like the sensation of something being shoved into their ass.  If she knows she doesn't like the feeling of something going up her butt she shouldn't be pressured to try it.  

"
"Especially if FIL is not paying for the wedding but OP and has fiancée are funding everything themselves, then FIL has even less than zero input or demands to make."
"Make no mistake. Her inability to fully apologize and take responsibility when she's in the wrong is just another hallmark of her abusive personality. Your mom is never and was never a great mom. Anyone can be nice sometimes, and people like your mom tend to be overly nice during the good times just to win back your admiration so you remain emotionally dependent on them despite their abuse.

Please seek counseling to help you work through this."
You did not do anything wrong. You made yourself clear. He just doesn't want to listen.

"To be fair, it's hard to be the only one talking about subjects like that. Not to mention sometimes you just run out of content to talk about that isn't current events. If you want conversations like that, you have to try to contribute as well. 

Maybe you could start reading books together and discussing them."
"And I bet OP's wife would much rather her husband take PTO to maybe give her a break instead of his sister. I understand OP cares about his sister, but she is a grown adult who made choices. OP still has a wife and kids of his own to take care of. I think even him going to stay worth his sister for a few weeks and leaving his wife to be a single mom is unfair."
I can guarantee your fiance will not want her at the wedding.  So start talking about that part now.  
"Did she just start high school this fall? That's a really stressful time, especially for a kid who struggles to fit in. She might just need some comfort from you."
"True in a sense, but the incident at the trampoline park gave us a very good window into Dean's parenting skills. Why on earth was Randall allowed to torment a much younger boy relentlessly until THAT boy had to leave? This kid is a horrible little bully and his dad sits by and does nothing. He should have been removed from the trampoline park immediately."
"Right? Like, does this guy have Internet access? You don't have to do an entire Italian opera plot to get pictures of naked women.

He's waaaay too into his ex and not nearly into OP enough."
"I would try therapy then. He sounds like he hates his life just in general and regrets having a child. That regret is then compounded because he probably doesn't Want to regret it, he wants to want to have a child, but he doesn't. "
"You need to have a very firm conversation with her that it is not her place to experiment with your illness. She may think it's exacerbated by the mental aspect, but she does not get to play with your health to prove herself right. She does not get to second guess doctor's orders. She owes you a real apology, the kind where she recognizes why what she did was wrong and promises she won't do it again."
"Give mom &amp; dad a couple days to cool down first - but personally I think they are way overreacting.


Possibly try to single one of them out (whoever seems most reasonable, sounds like dad) and mention that you are almost an adult (18) and that you still love your parents and want to be a part of their lives, but hitting you like this is just creating a gap.


Assure them you don't want to openly discuss physical intimacy with them on the normal, but recall that you were being discrete, respectful and **safe**.    Make a few more pitches about how you are a good kid, then ask them to reconsider their punishments and leave it at that.


The might think ""damn, he has some good points"".  Since you've given them time to cool off, that will help.  Singling out dad and getting him into the idea might help him work on your mom too.


Worst case, get a job - but your own phone to communicate with your GF, but don't flaunt that in your parents face.  Eventually when you turn 18, they can ""kick you out"" if you disobey their rules, but also you can legally GFO on your own."
"&gt; Get a male friend to pose as the groom, but in the middle of the ceremony, you burst in and object. Then you marry Mandy.

This is just perfect.

EDIT: I'm imagining the 'groom' then vanishes in a puff of smoke, the traditional cake and decorations turn around and are rainbows, the priest pulls off his mask and it was Ellen the whole time.

Like that scene where Dumbledore gives Gryffindor the house cup but better."
That's like getting mad at you for saying water is wet.
"You sit next to each other, do you report to the same manager? A quick ""here's something affecting the team"" pow-wow saying that you want him to knock it off might help.

If you don't report to the same person, it might still make sense to bring up with your manager. She might tell you to ignore it, but you never know."
I should say that to them! Even her parents won't let them come back. 
"You should apologize for ruining his party by being surly and then shouting at him. I hope you didn't blame it on PMS to his face. That's a weak excuse in the best of times, and at worst encourages men to associate irrational women with PMS. You can't use it as a shield without it being used as a weapon against you.

You can't plan a surprise party and then get upset when the birthday boy doesn't know about it. That's kind of the point. If you had wanted him to keep the night free, you need to tell him, and even then, it's his birthday. It should be up to him how he spends it."
IDK why him not remembering makes it easier for you to look past? I manage to get black out drunk &amp; NOT hook up with other people. 
"Exactly.  Though, dollars to donuts he has completely erased any and all conversation history by this point.

If so, that's like a smoking gun"
Do you want to be like him? Holding onto someone that is in love with someone else/doesn't want to commit to you? Because that's what you are doing. Move on. He clearly and objectively  is not perfect for you - he is in love with someone else! That's the most important part of compatibility for crying out loud. The MOST IMPORTANT PART. 
"&gt; I would like to keep and raise this baby alongside with him

Well, that's not going to happen, because you are broken up.  It's okay if you don't want to have an abortion, but you have to face that you are going to raise the child by yourself or possibly be able to give him/her up for adoption?  Do you have family and friends that can help you with this decision?  This is huge for you, so don't make it lightly."
"I don't really think he means well if he doesn't consider you at all. It takes ten seconds to say he's going to hang out with a friend so there's a change in plans. If he genuinely felt bad about the art walk and picnic, he'd not fucking complain about staying up a little later to play a board game with you. The fucking nerve. 

And not accompanying you to your mother's funeral doesn't have anything to do with 'us' time or emotional immaturity; it's a plain dick move. 

I think you need to be a lot more explicit to him about how callous he's being and how low on his priorities you feel, but I also feel like ten years of this sets a precedent for him - would he be willing to change or be better with you? This is why everyone else in this thread thinks you need to break it off - what an exhausting, lonely relationship. "
"""So who spanked it into my laundry basket?""

You don't owe them a non-awkward conversation. You do, however, owe it to yourself to be straightforward about this and about how violated you feel. If it embarrasses the 13-year-old into not doing shit like that, that's all the better."
"Man, this. 

My dad used to speak about this amazing First Nations guy in the military. He worked hard and was great at his job. He brought more to the team than many. 

But everytime he got off the base and headed back to the reserves, he'd fall back to drinking. He got back into the same habits he joined the military to escape in the first place. 

He, as a person, had great ability. But unfortunately the physical environment he was raised in and his family was stuck in, put up a lot of barriers. 

I hope the best for OP. He has earned success. "
She's Hmong and she's a girl.  Dad's not going to ask her for financial assistance in the future if he's as traditional as I think he is.
My money is on this being projection.
"Holy shit, I missed the part where they've only been together for 5 months. OP, why are you setting so much stock in your future earnings for such a new relationship? She's taking advantage of you. "
"I think there may have been a miscommunication regarding the actual appointment being the way you needed him to be there for you during this time. Maybe he thought you meant emotionally and since you didn't express a problem with him being on call and perhaps needed to leave during the appointment, that this was okay with you.

I think it's okay to feel hurt and upset with him. I just think given the fact when you really expressed you needed him there, he did what he had to get out of work and be there for you. That says something. I think he was somewhat of an idiot for sure, but I don't think it's because he doesn't care about you. "
"If I were you, I'd tell your friend. True or not, that roommate searched for this stuff and is telling people. If it's a lie he's ruining his reputation. If it's true, he should know his bad habits are now public. 

Either way, like others have said I'd just be cautious, but wouldn't worry about your safety unless something indicates you should."
"I absolutely agree with this, safety is the first and paramount concern, announcing that you are leaving or intend to leave could provoke violence.  Another factor to consider is that if you tell your husband your plan then he may take steps to prevent you from being able to carry it out, including preventing you from having access to your child without others present, making it difficult to take them with you, or he might see a lawyer and take action that way. 

You are in your strongest position if you ensure the safety of yourself and your child first and then go from there."
"You do not owe him your story. But you need to be aware that some people will not be willing to live with such a great unknown. Had he known, he could have avoided the fireworks part of the day, or not invited you so he didn't have to leave early. Your trauma is now impacting his life, and he has the right not to be ok with that without knowing the story."
"He's killed animals before so you get him another animal that has previously been abused? Dude, full stop, that is is so unfair to the dog. She is not a trained therapy dog. She is terrified of him when he's angry and your ex is right, it is most likely only a matter of time before he turns his anger on her. And now you want to give him another one?

If he's been in therapy for years and it hasn't been effective, find him a new therapist. He probably needs a combination of intense therapy and maybe medication to get himself under control. 

"
"How is this even a question?

Forget why he did it, which is psychotic. Forget that he obviously still has some sort of feelings for Brooke, and that he doesn't respect your relationship. Forget everything except the fact that he went out of his way so much to manipulate you.

Name one reason you'd even want to stay with him. I'll wait."
"&gt; It's much easier to believe in forgiveness when you haven't been faced with forgiving abuse, neglect and endangerment.

I always find this really hard to explain but this wording is really nice. Thank you."
"Yeah, if she was accusing you relentlessly of cheating, she was probably doing it herself already.

&gt; I have come to realize that she was able to move on so quickly because she was never invested in our relationship. 

Nope the reason she was able to move on so quickly was because she already was seeing her new bf or had him lined up.

&gt; I had sold my house, paid off her debt, sold my 401k and stocks, all to help her get through college and pay for all living costs

You set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. There's nothing wrong with supporting a partner/ girlfriend financially, but not to the holy hell extent you did in a period of just two years.

&gt; Things were going amazing (best relationship I've ever had)

If you're giving me effectively $250k a year, even I'll give you the best relationship you've ever had

&gt; after losing everything, my ex-fiancé, money, savings, house, re-starting career (again), and friends, how do I pull myself out of this rut and get over this woman??????

You've made one significant step by restarting your career, and rebuilding your friendships. 

I do hope to god you're not still speaking to her, as this will keep stabbing you, and distance is needed to recover. 

"
"Exactly. Your boyfriend probably knows this too, which is why he's giving you such unrealistic goals before you get married (e.g. wanting you to go off your meds and 'get better'...which he knows may take years). He's hoping he can make you wait and wait and wait, until you're too old for kids."
"A firm, forceful ""DON'T TOUCH MY CHILD."" usually gets results.

I don't care how many people I alienate.  If you cross the boundaries of me or my loved ones it will be the last time. "
"Wow...so much wrong with that guy. 

So, I'd suggest one last reply. ""I do not wish to hear from you again. Do not try and contact me in any way directly or through a 3rd party. Any continuing attempts at contact will be considered harassment and reported to authorities.""

Block his number if you can and don't return calls or texts if you can't, delete and block him from social media as well. And, if the law where you live allows it, report continued contact as harassment. 

His oddly possessive reaction seems really off to me, so at least getting stuff on record is a way to protect yourself from any future shenanigans. "
"Oh god, I've got a 2-week old and just reading this stressed me out.  Props to you for even attempting it!"
"Police police police. Do it, OP."
"He doesn't actually think he's being friendly. He thinks *you* are obligated to be friendly to *him*. Big difference. 

There's a reason he goes for women he considers powerless. You know he has a history of this. It is absolutely intentional. He thinks you owe him your time and interest purely because he considers himself more powerful than you. It is completely necessary at this point to alert your supervisor and consider police intervention, because nothing *you* say will be enough to put him off. "

"First off, deep breath. 
sorry to pry, but...
It's a little unclear - did he take off the condom at some point? "
"&gt;It doesn't matter what your brother did or did not say. Violence is never the answer. EVER.

YES, EXACTLY. It literally does not matter AT ALL what your brother said. He does not have to accept a forced apology from someone who consistently hits on his wife and is in general a major asshole, and all it seems he did was say something really rude. Your BIL's response was literally insane, and unforgivably violent. The only problem here is that your BIL physically attacked a family member. Your husband is so far out-of-line for pretending that your brother is the issue here. Him pushing his volatile brother into a family event where you did not want him caused this mess, anyway."
And book airbnb if you think he might show up. 
"I think she's within her rights to say to Allen ""You touch a drink whilst you're near me or my kid and I'm gone for the evening"", I don't think anyone with any sense would expect the entire family to sit drinking Ribena all evening"
"Consider changing therapist. There are several therapy schools, each one with a particular set of theories and therapy approaches. When you start psychological therapy you need to consider both the therapist as a person *and* his/her approach to therapy: you have to click with both, the person and the theories he/she uses to treat you.

Sometimes you have to search for the right therapist for a while. Try speaking with your therapist and seeking advice: considering you don't find therapy useful she should be able to point you towards a colleague with a different approach."
"That is one of those things that would be a red flag in same age couples, too.   "
"So much for bodily autonomy, I guess. Stand your ground. It's your house, too. Move out when you can and for the love of God, help Pam get out of that house, too. I guarantee you, her mother is trying to drill it into her head that she is now a slut because she didn't wait until marriage, and considering how sheltered she was and how little knowledge she had about the male form, it's a safe bet that any vile thing her mother tells her will stick. That will have massive consequences for her mental health in the future."
"When you can safely talk, call a domestic violence hotline and ask for their advice on how to safely get out of a relationship like this. Erase your phone history after you make the call."
"THIS. What sort of horrible person are you dating? He's happy to lie about her and assassinate her character to get what he wants. Honestly, what sort of person are you that you are even remotely considering it? Like, I'm glad that you're asking people's opinions and I hope you do the right thing but bloody hell, the fact that you even need to ask says a lot about the kind of person you are and the strength of your character. "
You should tell her before she sets him up with any other unsuspecting girls.
"&gt;its just we didn't have anal sex with anyone else because we were scared of STDs.

Oh, because you were scared of STDs, not because, you know.. you didn't want to be EVEN MORE of a cheating scumbag? That's why you didn't have sex with anyone else?

Your wife patiently (and I assume faithfully) waited three years for you to get out of prison, all while you're screwing someone else on a regular basis. It doesn't matter that it was a man, and that it was in prison.

You sound like a real winner."
"I would bet real, actual money that she is not pregnant.

Tell her to let you know when she wants to get a paternity test and to not contact you until she does. Stop talking to her except through email that you can keep track of. She sounds really unstable."
"&gt;She also says it's disrespectful to my husband that I brought ""another man"" to his bed, 

So she basically accused you of fucking your brother but you're meant to apologise? I think your husband needs to start acting like one here and really have your back instead of leave you to be talked to like this."
"Between the groping, the yelling, the shoving...Jesus, lady. If you have to ask this question when you're only six goddamn months in, then your relationship is shit.

Six months. You should should still be in the honeymoon stage. You should be so happy you're riding unicorns that shit rainbows. But instead you have a boyfriend who touches you sexually without consent, blocks your way when you want to leave and cool down...AND YOU'RE HAVING FIGHTS OF THIS CALIBER AT ALL, LET ALONE SO SOON.

You know, when they say relationships are hard work, they do NOT mean ""stay in a toxic situation or you didn't try."" Is this really what you think a healthy relationship looks like? Don't you think you can do better?  "
"What you list that's not working:

* sex
* physical activity level
* her appearance
* her unhealthy habits
* spending time with her
* her cultural background
* your love of music

What you have in common:

* you're both planning a wedding

You ought to really think about it.  Sit down and make a list of what works, what you have in common, to go along with this list of things that you don't have in common and that isn't working.

Pro-tip: the fact you are both planning a wedding should not actually be on the list of things that are going to make you joyful at the prospect of binding yourselves together for the rest of your lives.

The list of good things should dwarf the other list.  There should be at least 3 positives for every negative; it's better if there's 4.  Otherwise statistics suggest your marriage won't last long."
"First off, get into couples therapy because your anger at your wife needs to be addressed.

"Someone else's husband is not your boyfriend. You are getting 1 side of the story. You have no idea what the truth of the situation is.

Honestly, I suspect this is no different than any other affair where he tells you what you want to hear so you feel bad and let him have sex with you meanwhile stringing you along. 

He's a grown man. They aren't holding him hostage. He doesn't want to leave. Which is what happens in most affairs. I doubt anything he has told you is true. "
"Give it time. There are still a lot of ""I""'s in this post, and your sister is dealing with something complex, serious and difficult right now on several levels. She may not want to talk with you about this until she has sorted herself out.

Your dad may well have sent you away to shield you from this, or perhaps sent you away so that your adult sister does not feel she has to hold back her emotions because there is a child around.

Either way, let her sort this out."
"""Wow, mom, I can't believe you said that! I am so upset i have to end the call right now.""

(And hang up)

Clearly, she knows nothing about the USA job market. $80k is a great salary in some markets. Also, if she is going to insult you about your salary, you need to no longer discuss finances with her.

As others have mentioned, this is her being hurt that you won't agree to the arranged  marriage gamble, which would allow her to plan a multi-day party AND make new friends. "
"Should we just bring up the age gap and get it over with? 

OP, there's a reason a 33 year old man would actively date a 20 year old woman. It's because women his age wouldn't put up with this type of bullshit. He's manipulating you.  "

3k huh? You mean roughly the equivalent of 2 months rent for a one bedroom apartment on average across major metropolitan areas in the US? For a major medical expense for you mother. Think long and hard."
"So he is in a relationship with you... but he would rather be with her and thinks its OK to make advances on her. His reasoning for this is that despite being in a committed relationship with you, because he told you about his feelings for her a while ago he can cheat and pursue her all he wants.

Essentially this guy is saying that he thinks its OK to cheat on you and you're going to have to deal with it. Your options are stay with someone who will never put you first and will tell you straight to your face that he cares more about his ex than you or you can leave. I would suggest leave.

This isn't going to get better. He doesn't even think he did anything wrong. He is only apologizing because its what you want to hear, not because he is actually sorry for doing it. Leave. Let him pine for his ex while being single. Go find someone who is excited about dating you instead of wishing you were someone else."
It is harrassment. I'm from Northern Ireland too and was in a similar situation with an ex recently. Take screenshots of all the messages he sends you and if you can get copies of CCTV showing him coming into your workplace. Do NOT delete any messages he has sent. Get yourself down to the PSNI (Pizznee lol). This is 100% harrassment but the PSNI need 2 recorded instances of this behaviour in order to act on it. Each station will have someone there who is trained to help people with things like this. Please don't let this escalate any further.
"&gt;  I’m hoping the lawyer will take care of getting them out, but I’m more looking for advice on what to do about our mutual friends and if there is any hope at continuing our friendship.

Have you told your mutual friends about the part where they moved in to your bedroom while you were out of town? Or that they effectively were not paying rent by letting the yard/pool/etc get to the point where the city was sending letters?"

"Laying on top of you and not letting you go is not hugging you. He's literally redefining a word to deny his abusive behavior. 

I would just break up. But if you want to give him the benefit of the doubt, tell him you don't want it any more and you won't accept it any more. If he whines oh no you won't hug him anymore, remind him that that is not hugging.

I am dismayed how often women report this kind of behavior and just say they can't get up. Game over. He only lets her up when he wants to. 

There are ways to get him off yoi if he won't listen. Kick, hit, poke him in the eyes, bite, grab a finger and pull it back. Check out self defense videos for ideas how to overcome this kind of attack. Because that's what it is. 

And it can help you if someone else assaults you, too. "
why date a racist when you can date not a racist
Waste of energy to try and discuss this. Something didn't click for her and she has let you down gently. Accept that with grace and move on.
"&gt; I feel kind of dumb because I figured the first time of me saying that yes I had a boyfriend and no I was not interested would have been enough but apparently, it wasn't.

It's not your fault that HE is choosing to blatantly IGNORE your repeated no. You've done nothing wrong here."
"This sounds absolutely miserable. 

He won't let you buy food when you're hungry? Why do you need his permission? Do you have access to your own money? Why can't you just buy yourself some food?

I think you need to seriously consider breaking up with him and moving back to your home country. 

* He acts like he doesn't even like you. He's withdrawn all affection.
* He wants to live with his parents after marriage. He didn't bring this up until after you moved in with him. Do you get *any* say in this? 
* He doesn't allow you to buy food when you're hungry. 
* He ""measures your fat"" and tells you to lose weight. 
* He doesn't stand up for you when his family picks fights.
* When you try to address these issues with him, he says you have to deal with it. 

Any **one** of these issues would a good reason to break up. Seriously, he sounds abusive as fuck. And he's been very clear with you about the last point - he knows that things have changed and that you're not happy. He doesn't care.

Do you really want to live like this for the rest of your life? 

He may even get worse after you two get married or have kids. It's pretty common for abusive relationships to escalate after certain milestones (moving in together, getting married, having a baby, etc.) You've already seen this in your own life - he didn't start acting like this until after you moved countries to be with him. 

That's because now, you feel even more tied to your abuser. **He knows this**. He knows it's harder for you to leave him now, so he's free to treat you however he wants.

Do you have money for a plane ticket? Do you have friends or family that can help you move back home? Have you told any of them what's going on in your relationship? Maybe your old employer would be willing to give you your job back. 

Realize that if you stay, none of this will change. He's made that clear already. You deserve far better than this."
"I know a number of people in their mid 30's who want to split expenses 50/50 with their partner. Know what they do? Explicitly look to date people with similar incomes (or at least similar disposable income.) This often means dating someone very close to their age. I also know people in their mid 30's who really want to have sex with 22 year olds. Know what they do? Pay their rent. 

Yes, some 22 year olds are millionnaires, but the average one is not - especially not if they're still in school. Unless you were earning on par with your boyfriend when he met you, he knew what he was getting into - I assume he knows what you earn? 

If he wants you to join him at restaurants and bars and vacations, and for you to have on-trend electronics, he can pay for them. If not, he can shut up. 

I'm 29 and I have cousins around your age. If we're going out for dinner, I assume I'm paying. I have a similar age gap that you do, with my husband, who makes about 4x that I do. When we were dating (now married in a community property state) he paid for everything (I bought after dinner coffee and cooked dinners at his place.) The only way it should be 50/50 with a solid income gap is if the lower earner sets the spending pace and the higher earner is happy about that (more money to investments and the like.) 

Also be wary of men who want to tell you how a female feminist should act. "
"Well this has all the tell-tale signs of a toxic relationship in the making, just by the fist line.  I think I'll start counting the ways as I read:

&gt; After dating my fiancé for about 6 months (most of it long distance), we decided that we were at a stage where we were sure that we have very strong feelings for each other and were ready to settle down together

There's one!  Quick escalation to locking down.  That’s a classic.

&gt; Call me cheesy, but I've never been so in love and sure of someone. He has my complete trust.

Yep, that’s not healthy so early on.  Normal, healthy relationships progress to this organically, over time.  Jumping right into this is a sign of rollercoaster hills and valleys ahead. 

&gt; mother and sister [17F]) were spooked by the idea of me dating someone long distance and they found the concept and him really shady

Uh…if it was just your mom I might think it could just be her, but if your sister was also getting bad vibes, there is probably something to that.

&gt; He is very transparent and charismatic 

“Very charismatic” is something that I’ve noticed in every single cluster-B personality disordered patient I’ve worked with.  It is pretty much a given.   It's how they trap victims.

&gt; He has been nothing but an angel, wanting to move in with me and abandon a life he made for himself back home because he saw a love worth risking for. 

LOL!  Jesus I can’t even.   What a loser...

&gt; He told me he's going to make up the difference in what pay my mom cut for me and support me in whatever way I need.


Yes…that is not healthy, but it looks like things are working out nicely for him.  He’s already got you isolated from family and becoming financially dependent on him.  That’s impressive work.  You must be very naïve for him to pull this off so quickly.   I know you think this is a unique situation and your mom just doesn’t understand, but this is a tale as old as time.  I’ve seen this exact pattern play out more times that I can count. 

Oh and by the way, I oppose religion pretty vehemently.  But I think your mom is right here about a lot of things.  She is paying for your apartment and for you to go to school in another country which is WAAAYYYYYY more than most parents.  I can’t even imagine getting an allowance at 21, AND an apartment.   You sound incredibly entitled. 

You want your boyfriend to move in with you.  I get it.  You’re young and the idea of playing house is fun to you.  When you’re older you’ll understand why this is an incredibly stupid idea.  

You’re mom is paying for that apartment for YOU, not for you plus your boy toy.  Seriously, grow up. 

EDIT:  And you can't see this now, but this guy is a loser.  Only a loser would leave a steady job to rush off and marry a 21 year old in another country. At best, he's a moron who is letting puppy love get in the way of real life decision making.  At worst, he's an abuser looking for a naive victim.  

There is no scenario where he isn't a loser. 

"
"That's an excellent point. Honestly, as information seeps out, this whole idea is starting to feel like revenge against his wife, rather than anything calculated for the best interest of his sister and her baby. She's certainly not going to have any peace and quiet with three young children in the house.

Someone below suggested he do a short-term home rental. That seems like it could be a good idea."

He's not yours to let go. You do not have a hold on him. 
"After stealing from you, he absolutely should not be allowed in your home. Your son is old enough to make his own decisions and live outside the home. Tough love is hard for parents sometimes, but he will continue to make bad decisions if he knows there are no consequences and that he always has a safety net. Abuse is tricky, because I do not blame the victim for it, however he needs to walk away from this toxic person.  If he can't do that he should no longer be in your home. You can visit and see him but he has and will continue to take full advantage of you if you don't put your foot down. I don't think the SO has any business going to your husband's family event, given what has happened and your husband's opinion. "
"Your boyfriend is an asshole. An immature asshole. 

He's not being funny. He's not being cute. He's being a huge asshole. 

I would understand being surprised initially and making a few lighthearted jokes... but after a day of that the joke is over. Now he's just being a jerk. 

I would give him another chance. Explain that you don't appreciate his ""jokes"" you like what you do and it means a lot to you and if he can't accept that then he can take that rude attitude right out the door.

"This. And a rebound will almost never turn into something more. I feel like a lot of rebound relationships end in either the person getting back with their ex, or the person getting with someone totally new who makes them forget their ex.

"I mean, this is completely and totally your fault.

He told you all about his depression - how dare you not immediately make him feel better and try to take care of him.

Don't you realise how special he is? Because of his depression? 

Do you not understand that his depression is worse than yours - worse than anyones, because he's just an amazing guy?

Also, you get depression too (I mean, not as bad as his, obviously - but like a mild, girly sadness) surely you could empathise more. Surely you can see that your positive behavioural therapy and advice were actually hugely insulting - how dare you insinuate that he's even slightly responsible for his own health and happiness.

How very dare you try to answer the specific question he asked, even though it was hugely personal and intrusive.

And how dare you not struggle to answer the question, ultimately fail to answer it, and seek his superior wisdom for how to deal with your life.

Honestly, OP, it's almost like you *aren't* secretly in love with him and desperate to be in a relationship with him. It's like you don't think having depression is cool and edgy. It's almost like you think it's unhealthy to listen to someone moan for five hours and then tell them that they're brilliant for moaning.

It's all your fault - how dare you not appreciate how special he is.

And he's been *very* mature in how he's dealt with you subsequently. you had the temerity to be misunderstood by him and his thick mates, so he's entirely within his rights to passive-aggressively talk about you in posts you can't read, and you're lucky he had the grace and forbearance to only post a few pictures of flaccid penises.

You got off lucky here - You have sinned grievously and deserve all your punishments."
"I don't like to advocate violence, but kneeing someone in the crotch is a perfectly proportionate response to behavior like his. OP, you UNDERREACTED if anything. I might have tried to hit him in your situation."
"&gt; He blew up at me about me trying to control the conversation and tell him what he could and couldn't talk about. 

Nope, he can talk about whatever he likes, *but you don't have to listen to it*. That's **him** trying to control the conversation, making you listen to things he KNOWS you don't want to hear about, because it's more important to him that he gets to do what he wants than you get to feel comfortable."
"Hmm. I'm sure you're right that your ADHD is a problem in your marriage, historically, as you say. 

But in this particular situation, the fact your wife didn't eat all day is a tiny bit your fault (you said you would get her some take away food, and presumably forgot?) but mostly on her. The weird passive aggressive nonsense with the poutine? That's all on her. 

I mean, I guess that after years of you not being a functioning adult, a normal bout of forgetfulness might hurt her more than it would hurt other people. But I'm not really seeing how this particular story is your fault. "
"I mean, I get where he's coming from but if he never stands up to his mom, this is going to keep happening.  Either you'll have to go along with whatever bizarre demands she has - spend time with just her after every family event, rely on her more than your family of origin, not see your brother alone, etc. - or she's going to keep making problems with you.  Does your husband actually think her behavior will stop now if you apologize, or does he understand that the apology is just a temporary bandage on a much larger problem?

I'm willing to bet your husband grew up appeasing his mom, doesn't think much of it because it was ""normal"" in his household, and thinks you're overreacting because he doesn't see how bizarre his mom's behavior is to people on the outside."
"Nah, just telling them to try watersports"
"I am sorry, but your parents are not good parents based on what you wrote and commented. Even just what you described is enough of an explanation for why she ran away. Imagine being in her place where the person supposed to take care of you and love you calls you worthless? However she treats you, she is not a good mom and she has driven your sister away. I'm truly sorry but I think this is the truth and you should try to forgive your sister. If you want to be in her life after you no longer live with your mother, you will probably have to apologize for not standing up for her and be willing to respect her not wanting to see your mother. She may be upset with you and your brother for standing by and letting her be mistreated as well. This isn't your fault, but advise if you want to get back in touch with her and for you to think about how your parents really are. Do not blame yourself as You had no point of reference to know. 

Edit: some words"
"Boy howdy.

I think that, ignoring context, your comment was a more cutting than his - especially in front of friends.

*That said*, you can't ignore context.

This guy quit his job to go back to school and he hasn't even applied anywhere?  What was the point of quitting if he wasn't going to immediately start trying to get into a program?  What is his logic in any of this?  Most people would wait to get into a program before quitting - it's staggering that he'd quit, burden you with all the finances, and then just spin his wheels.

Then, while you've had to do a big career switch in order to accommodate his goals (is it a goal if he's not doing shit to achieve it?), he makes fun of it, to your face, in front of your friends.

I can see lashing out at that point.  But I do think you should own the fact that it was lashing out and *not* a gentle ribbing.  I get that he made his bed, I get that what he said was shitty, I'm totally on your side, but you basically just ""joked"" that he was lazy and getting his way paid.  That feels harsh.

It's not necessarily the words so much as the scene.  If I were your friend, I'd be immediately uncomfortable witnessing what is clearly a serious relationship issue being cloaked in barbed humor.  I'd be embarrassed for both of you - especially if I hadn't experienced or heard about your frustrations with the situation beforehand.  It'd feel awkward.

This is a breakdown in communication.  Resentment has been building on your end, and a weird superiority complex on his.  It grew until you guys had it out in a *really* passive aggressive and counterproductive manner.  You guys need to learn to have more adult and forthright conversations rather than joke *around* your issues until you end up hurting each other.

Instead of framing it as: ""It was a mean joke in response to your mean joke,"" I'd put it more like, ""I was honestly offended and I got defensive.  I should have talked to you about it at home and it was a knee jerk reaction, but we really need to talk about this.  I've busted my ass to keep us afloat because I wanted to support you, but I haven't seen any effort from you.  So for you to disrespect the job I took to keep us from going into debt while you do *nothing* to help me put me over the edge.  You don't have to like my job, but you can't shit all over it while it puts food on our table.  I'm sorry for embarrassing you, but we need to discuss boundaries and basic respect.""

If he still refuses to apologize and act like a kid, then fine.  He wants to be a poor grad student, let him.  Call up a lawyer, enjoy your lucrative job as a single lady, and let him eat ramen until he gets his degree."

&gt; I went over, got drunk on red wine, made out with my friend mostly out of spite, and stayed the night. 

Wow...Some friend. First he/she stirs the pot of your relationship, and then swoops in when you're vulnerable. And you fell for it! I get you're devastated at the thought of your boyfriend cheating, but I feel like an alarm should have been going off in your head. Your ""friend's"" eagerness to make out with you shortly after exposing your boyfriend's ""infidelity"" was *shady as fuck*.

&gt; My friend is assuring me that there is no explanation other than cheating, and I did right, but I honestly don't know right now.

Uhhhh...It's pretty obvious that your friend has an ulterior motive and jumped at the chance to play on your insecurity and ruin your relationship. I have no idea what will happen with you and your boyfriend, but you better ditch this ""friend.""  This is not someone who's got your back."

"I'm a mother myself and I was raised in an abusive home. Please listen to what I have to say:

&gt;Am I in denial?

You aren't just in denial. You have been enabling his behavior, and as such, you have exposed your children to abuse. I know you didn't mean to or want to, but the reality of it is that they have been exposed to abuse by you and your husband. 

What we know as normal and what we learn in how to behave and interact with others is shaped by our parents. They create and mold a lot of our viewpoints and our actions and reactions to behaviors and emotions. 

You have pointed out in your text that you don't want him or his career to be ruined, but I see nothing in you wanting to raise your children in a healthy home with healthy relationships and values. I'm not saying you don't want to, but I'm pointing this out because you are focused on the wrong thing. This isn't about your husband, this is about your children. He's a grown man, he can take care of himself. They can't.

If your husband does indeed becomes ""ruined"" by all of this, it's by his hand and not yours. Let him deal with his own consequences for once, because you certainly aren't doing him any favors. You have been taking responsibility for his actions for far too long and you have yet to learn that you can't control him and you simply can't be responsible for him and the things that he does. I highly encourage you to embrace this as your mantra so you can let go trying to either save and fix your husband, who can't be saved or fixed, and focus on those that can be: YOUR CHILDREN. 

It is abuse for your children to witness the emotional, psychological, and now physical abuse you have been dealing with when it comes to your husband. They are cultivating deep seeded anxiety, fear, and a warped view of how people should behave and what relationships should look like. Their self esteems are being destroyed before they can even develop. Your husband in some ways reminds me of my father. He was a loose cannon as well that would fly into rages at a whim and with no warning. He was diagnosed bipolar after my mom died when I was 30. Even now I'm very low contact with him, because it's better this way. My life is healthier without him near. And because I won't expose my child to that life that I lived. My childhood was not good and I resent both of my parents for what they have jointly put me through. Please note that I have been in counseling as an adult for many many years. Not one counselor has ever thought keeping either parent in my life was worth it at the cost of my own mental health. You shouldn't think that either.

You have the ability to walk away from your husband at any time, but your children do not. Someone like your husband needs an object of justification for his anger. If it's not you, it's going to be them, and he has proven that. 

Abuse is not your fault when it comes to you. It's not your fault your husband has chosen to treat you this way. BUT. You have not just a legal obligation, but an obligation as a mother to protect your children at all costs, and when it comes to exposing your children to abuse, you are at fault. I know that sounds harsh, and it is, but it's true. Your children are watching. What you do now in all of this is going to have far rippling consequences that will last far into their adulthood. I'm glad the oldest is in counseling, but they all need to be. They also need to know that this was not their fault and that their dad isn't healthy. That this isn't how you treat people. They need to see things can be and will be better. They need to know and feel that their lives won't be like this. Or they will seek it out in their adulthoods' because it's all they will ever know. 

In a perfect world, your husband would turn a leaf and fix himself. We don't live in a perfect world. He behaves this way because he chooses to do so. Does he act this way at work? How about with most people? I bet the answer is no. ***He refuses counseling because he does not see a problem with his actions.*** You can't change that. He will always blame you. You will have no vindication in your life. 

&gt;If I hadn't yelled back maybe none of this would have happened. 

You've had many many moments where you didn't yell back. The behavior continued.  You can't control him. 

&gt;Our oldest already has some anger management issues and I won't let that cycle continue.

If you go back, you will let the cycle continue. You will be actively choosing to expose your children to abuse. 

&gt;His parents were more worried how he will get bailed out then for our well-being. 

Where do you think this behavior comes from? I'm quite sure he has a history of having consequences negated for him, and as such, has grown quite comfortable with shifting the blame to everyone else. Why would you even be upset with them for this behavior? You are also doing this to some extend, and have done so for a while. 

&gt;I want him to get help.

***BUT HE DOES NOT WANT TO.***

Look, we get so afraid of victim blaming, we shy away from telling someone their parts in where they were wrong and especially the parts they need to here. You need to hear that you were exposing your children to abuse. In some states, like mine, children witnessing domestic violence and abuse is **grounds for immediate children removal**. Depending on where you are, you can lose your children if you go back and it happens again. And trust me, if you go back, it ***will*** happen again. 

One final thing: You need a lawyer and you need to battle for full custody. He can't handle an hour of reading without flying into a rage. You won't be there to protect them from him. You need to document all your interactions. You need to fight for court mandated protection for your children. Your children need a courtroom advocate independent from both you and your husband, because even now you are bias to your husband and could be a further risk of exposing them to further abuse because you want to preserve the relationship. That's not your job, that's his. You need someone with a fully functional and normal moral compass who hasn't normalized his behavior and it's still convinced he can be better or fixed if you give him ""just a little more time"". He's out of time. Finally, you need to be in counseling for domestic abuse. You need to confront what your marriage has been and what that has done to you. 

Your children won't get another childhood. And you won't get a do over. "
"Same with me. Dad went to my brother's sports games whenever he could, but barely showed up for my events, regardless of what they were- horse shows, art shows, concerts, whatever. If he did show up, it was just for a few minutes and then he'd leave. If he drove me to practice or a lesson, he'd leave to go do something else and then show up again when it was time to leave. It really sucked, and I still don't really get why it was so different for my brother and I. "

"It is illegal. I had to take my landlord to court over this a few years back because my landlord was a guy and it was seriously creeping me and my roommate out that he'd come over without notice. When we talked to him about it, he started giving us notice of like a text message 30 minutes before he went over - still not good enough.

The threat of legal action might make her stop. I think it gets tricky because laws tend to favor landlords over tenants, so if there's anything you've done that she can throw back at you, you might just be wasting your money. The next step to escalate is document all of this, find a lawyer who specializes in tenant issues, and go to court. If they're like my landlord, they'll settle out of court, which saves you both some time and money."
"Tell the parents, they need to know.  People may disagree with me on this but I see a 24 year old with a 16 year old as predatory.  It would be terrible if you said nothing and this girl continued to seek out older scumbags to take advantage of her."
"Wait, Belize isn't an island. I don't think it's reasonable to claim *everywhere warm* as ""dream vacation"" and thus ban your boyfriend from ever taking them. He's not taking your dream vacation. He's taking a vacation.

It sounds like in a healthy, happy relationship you can give up a holiday so he can go do something cool with family. But it sounds like you're not happy to begin with so this is a bigger deal than it should be. Will he be using his vacation time on this, cutting into time you two could take a vacation together? Or is he perfectly capable of going on another vacation with you later?

If he can go on another vacation with you, I would let this one go on the condition that he plan a vacation for the two of you in the next 6 months. Then start asking your good friends; I'm certain one of them would be willing to take in a stray on Christmas."
Then leave it when you move for the next redditor to find. 
"&gt;This was important because, it was our first date.

So he cheated before your first date?  He cancelled the first date because he had an infection?  So the sex occurred before your first date?

If I'm reading that correctly, I'm missing the part where this was cheating."

You're absolutely not overreacting. This is a huge betrayal. 
"Thank you (both andthatsathrowaway and drama_throw_away), this is the kick in the ass language I need.  I have a hard time seeing Dean in that light because 95% of the time we spend together is just the two of us, and he is a wonderful person: he's got a wide circle of friends who all value him dearly, and is a wonderful boyfriend to me.  We can make each other laugh like nothing else, have the same interests, and want the same things in the long term.  But this does not negate his shortcomings as a father to Randall.

&amp;nbsp;

You are also right that me wanting to be in Dean's life but not Randall's is selfish, and would contribute to his issues."
"I am not a sexual abuse survivor and I think what he did was pretty bad.  Him even *asking* for sex when you were that sick is bad. Then he proceeded to use you for his own sexual gratification after you said no.  That's a **huge** violation.  He treated you like an object, not a person.  He wasn't thinking of you at all.  Then he only asked again for consent when he had already gone waaaay beyond crossing the line.

Top it off that you are an abuse survivor and his actions are even more thoughtless and disgusting.  It's good that he feels awful, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place.  

I want to encourage you to do some deep thinking on this.  Make sure there haven't been any red flags with this guy that you've been overlooking.  Your history may be clouding your intuition or judgment.  He might be a great guy who made a stupidly fucked-up decision, but I want you to be sure of that if you are considering staying with him.  Talk to your therapist, as well.

Also, if you find that you can't move past it and don't feel safe with him, trust your gut.  "
"Your parents are conservative morons, but there's not much you can do. Focus on what you can control, like school and getting a job so that you can get out of the house."
"Is this fraud? I'm serious. He included some things he'd done but not other ones. 

And what is the harm here?"
"Haha for what it's worth, he did come home while I was on the phone with my sister... And even though I thought I had seamlessly transitioned conversation topics, I did take the phone call in the other room which I guess may have tipped him off...

Whatever, works for me :) "
"Partners can have different sex drives or tolerance for touch without disrespecting each other. This has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with his lack of respect and boundary stomping. Your husband is blowing off your wishes when it comes to your body. He's touching you in intimate ways after you've repeatedly made it clear you aren't comfortable with that happening in public or with him constantly pawing at you at home. That's disturbing.

How is he about your sex life? Does he respect your boundaries when it comes to sex and what sex acts you perform on each other? Does he pressure you to have sex (e.g., whine, complain, badger you repeatedly till you give in to shut him up, etc.) when you don't feel like it or have said no? 

Look, you can certainly try couples counseling. Maybe he will take it more seriously if he hears it with an authoritative third party involved. But I'd be pretty angry and resentful if the person who was supposed to be my partner didn't respect me enough to abide by my requests for him to not feel me up in public or shove his tongue in my mouth in front of my parents. If it took a therapist to convince him to show basic respect for my bodily autonomy, I would have real concerns about the relationship. "
"Even if you had had unprotected sex on aug 22, any pregnancy would be showing up in tests by now. You can only get pregnant in the few days before ovulation. After you ovulate your body prepares for a fertilized embryo to implant in your uterus 7-10 days after ovulation). If this doesn't happen, then you get your period a few days later (approx 14 days after ovulation, or up to 17 days after you had sex). Pregnancy tests detect a pregnancy within a few days of implantation, so anywhere from about 10 days after you had sex up to around 14 days after you ovulated.

Given you didn't even have sex and it sounds like there was no contact with his semen and you haven't had a positive test more than 21 days after the event, the chance of you being pregnant is absolutely minuscule. I'd put half my bank account on it. You probably ovulated later than usual and that's why your period is 'late'. I suggest reading up on how your repro system works so you won't have to worry so much in future."
"&gt; And he's probably the one taking the pics.

Exactly.

OP's brother and his gf are broke and realized they can turn their hobby into making ends meet.  She said herself that her brother is in debt.  He learned how to shoot photos so they can save on production costs.  When OP asked her brother about it, he was ashamed of his financial situation and let OP believe it was simply about validation when really...they are just broke af and making ends meet selling nudes.

At least that's how I read it.

It's totally possible that they both just like it, as well."
"I feel like I'm always spouting ""don't yuck someone's yum"" constantly. It started with my kid sister and food, but I've had to tell grown adults to not mock other people's hobbies with that same line. I've also heard people use it in regards to letting people enjoy their own kinks and sexual fantasies (as long as all parties are consenting adults obviously) too."
"Respond to every single instance by saying something like ""He's the love of my life. I'm lucky I found him."" Bonus points for looking your partner right in the eyes and smiling when you say it. By saying it directly to him instead of to the bozo who is making a comment, you are taking a moment to affirm your connection to each other. It also has the added effect of shutting the bozo out of your little world, even if it's just for a moment. "
"Look, I was 100% in your corner until you started shaming her for *eating breakfast each day*. That casts a lot of doubt over the rest of your comments here...

She is entitled to eat breakfast. That is not a 'snack'. Most people are healthier and happier during their day for eating breakfast. If you are not one of them, fine. She is. That is deserving of respect.

Buy more damn cereal. It's not like it rots in a week, just have a backup box.

Talk about the other issues and the consideration you'd like to see. It's not about what she is eating, it's about the fact you would like to have access to these things too even though she is home more often than you are. You're asking her to moderate her snaking as a consideration to you. It has nothing to do with her eating habits and just has to do with the fact you two are different people who are trying to accommodate your differences in schedule and habits.

If that is a struggle, buy and store your snacks separately. You don't need to ""hide"" them. Just tell you are putting them aside so they'll be there for you when you want them. "
"One would hope, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case.

"I think you need to talk to this guy about how he got the pictures, and why he still has them. He may not be someone you want to be friends with anymore. I would be livid if my boyfriend was aware that one of his friends had naked pictures of me that I was not aware of. Did she take the pictures? Did someone take pictures of her while she was passed out? Did someone record her having sex without her knowledge? Unless she sent these photos to your friend directly, your friend is trash."
"&gt; Unfortunately we don't all get the perfect setting to get to know each other, so we have to make decisions others wouldn't.


That's some pretty weird reasoning.

You don't get the perfect setting to meet people all the time. With lots of people.

The answer is then not to marry them to get to know them. 


""I don't know this person. I should marry him so I get to know him"" is just really weird. "
"There is no non-hurtful way to tell someone you don't want to spend time with them socially.

Just be polite and clear about it - you want to spend time with your friends alone. Do it in a private setting, and don't gossip about it with anyone else.

If he continues to harass you, a quiet discussion with your year adviser about the dilemma would probably help."

*or if not English probably best not to say fags. Or mate. "
"I just wanted to agree with the part about keeping boundaries.  OP, this will be essential if you have kids, intend to have them or if anyone else in your family would leave children in his care.  It's your right to forgive him but you have to keep in mind that re-offending for sexual offenses is incredibly high.  Offenders who target children have an even higher risk of recidivism.

Maybe you were a victim of convenience but who is to say there isn't or won't be another situation where he would offend?  The sad truth is that you can't ever 100% know he's changed.  You'll only know if he hasn't and another child is molested.  That's even assuming a victim comes forward.

The risk is high and the consequences are so terrible that you have to act accordingly."
Please do not start a family with this man. Your child will grow up abused or learn to be an abuser himself.

"&gt; Is it ever appropriate to cut yourself off from your in-laws, while your partner is still in contact with them?

No problem at all.

How about you stop justifying isolating yourself and let people know what is really going on.

Mistake here, you made a unilateral decision. It doesn't matter if you explained your reasons. After 8 years you'd think your relationship would be more of a partnership where you can collaborate and work through things together.

With that being said, she is overreacting, but you need to think about how you approach a disagreement."

"I know you think you know better than him, and maybe you do, but the way you approached this tells me a lot about why you and your brother have a shaky relationship. It sounds like you have a tendency to hover over his life and badger him with ""advice"" every time he doesn't do something exactly the way you think he should do it. 

Let him pursue this new idea he has. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. If it works, be happy for him, congratulate him, and don't ask him about going back to school. If it doesn't work, be ready to listen, and only offer advice when he asks for it. You can't live his life for him, no matter how hard you try to. "

I understand that you wouldn't eat the whole cake but it wouldn't have hurt you to just say thank you, it's really pretty, let's have sex and later talk about the cost and what-not.

My mother loves spicy foods.  She puts hot sauce on everything.  But one time, she tried a hot pepper at a Chinese restaurant and had an embarrassing episode just like your girlfriend.  If my father had even thought about her accusing her of lying during that moment, I am certain my mother wouldn't have been too pleased at all.  (Although I don't think she'd have him on ignore for two days. Either that was some serious spiciness or something else is going on between the two of you.)

So stop with the ""she lied!"" stuff.  Until she actually tells you that she lied, just assume this was a dining-out mishap."
"&gt;I'm honestly not sure of what she was thinking though, she acted like she really didn't realize she'd done something wrong.

Oh, she knew *exactly* what she was doing was wrong. She went behind you back to copy your keys (instead of just asking your permission) and then went into your house while you were gone (once again, without your permission). And she didn't come clean until you noticed something was off (i.e. the dogs paws were dirty). Who knows how long she would have kept the secret if you never noticed the dog's paws? *And* now she is refusing to give back *your property*?

If she was genuinely confused as to why she was in the wrong, she wouldn't have hid  it from you for 2 months. She would have just said, ""oh, I forgot to mention I copied you house key. I hope that's ok. If not, I'll give it back so you have a spare."" No, this psycho knows exactly what she is doing. "

Is this what he says? Or is this how you feel? Is he comparing you?

If you're feeling this despite him being supportive I would highly recommend getting involved in something. Volunteer somewhere meaningful to you, take up an artistic hobby, join a political group, take up a sport. Just because he works long hours and gets paid a lot (this is just how tech is) does not mean he is more valuable than you. 

Do you still go one dates? Does he make time for the relationship? It's great that he is finding professional success but if he is legit always busy that is a recipe for a sad home life. "

I don't think you fiance is actually being too controlling since its her wedding too. Your fiance is supporting a pregnant woman that has been cheated on by your homewrecking sister. You would be supporting said homewrecker if you stand by your sister.

Hmmm, **if there is going to be a wedding at all**, tell your fiance you don't have the balls to do it and let her tell your sister. I don't think theres no way your fiance will ever be good with your sister ever.  

Edit: Whos paying for the wedding?

Edit 2: Listen OP, I was the 1st to respond to your post but now that I've read your responses to everyones post (and the threads been locked), can I get your ex fiance's number after she cancels the wedding or after the divorce? I promise you and her that she will absolutely get a man that can make the right decisions to hard choices while still supporting her, this time. Seriously dude, you are f*cking up all over the place."
"""Mistake"" implies remorse or regret and your sister seems pretty darn pleased with herself right now. 

Your sister should not be in the wedding party and her married boyfriend should stay home.  

If sister can behave herself, she should be allowed as a guest.  

Edit - is the pregnant wife invited to the wedding?"
"&gt; he sees this as his *only* option to see his grandmother before she dies. **He wouldn't ask me otherwise.** This is desperation.

...desperation to make you cave and accommodate his father. Not desperation to see his grandmother. Because if that was the reason, he'd just go without you.

I'm not going to address how it's hard to get into couples counseling. I'm sure you're right. But when asking people for advice on a problem, the universal answer you are getting is that the problem is your husband being concerningly oblivious to your needs.

 You may be able to help him understand, but counseling is the best option, and either way, he can't be made to understand, he has to want to. And particularly for someone used to defending and accommodating a father who abused family members, that's hard. That's a tangled nest of snakes. "
"Sure she is unlikely to rape him, bit she needs to know her actions aren't ok and it isn't his responsibility to tell her that, it's the responsibility of her parents or teachers. If he tells someone in a role of responsibility, they can handle it with tact and the appropriate way. 

And FYI at 14 I had been assaulted by 3 of my peers. Their age is just the right time for this kind of thing to happen, we really need to educate them about appropriate behaviour two to three years earlier. "
"Imagine what it would do to your own son if he had to live with Randall. 

You are not a monster. You are protecting your son and yourself from a very troubled boy, one who has been violent and abusive enough in the past to be kicked out of numerous programs. The fact that Dean does not take Randall's behavior seriously is a big problem. This is the kind of boy who could easily end up in the news if nothing is done. If he does not get intensive treatment soon his behavior will be set and he will be on the road to becoming a violent, abusive adult. 

I can't believe that some authority figure has not recommended therapy for Randall at some point. Is Dean really that clueless?"
My ex (who was 29 at the time) got pissy with me because I said Jack Sparrow was hot when we watched the third POTC movie. Utterly ridiculous!
"She should also go through his wallet and look for an unfamiliar credit or bank card. My ex had one that he used exclusively for gifts for his mistress, in order to hide the purchases from me."
"So you cheated on your first wife with the woman who became your second wife. When your first wife discovered your affair and finished her masters program she moved home to look for a job. Right?

Now you're angry that she moved back home? Which she did because you cheated on her and divorced her? You're angry that you didn't learn about the baby after you made clear that you wanted nothing to do with your first wife any more? I can't imagine why she didn't tell you./s

This is why we treat people with decency and respect. Not only because it's the right thing to do, but because sometimes we only end up hurting ourselves when we don't."
"I'm so sorry OP. But you gotta tell her to take a hike.

Think on this: If her plans had worked she would have replaced you and not given a damn about what happened to *you*.

No sympathy for this woman. She is competing with you for your husband! Hell to the nah! Ignore her crocodile tales and your husband better back you up 100% when you tell her to get out. Her free ride is OVER."
"She's backing off because not only do you have the kind of ex that shows up unannounced, tries to barge into your home, and wants to ""meet"" your new girlfriend.  She's also the kind of ex that tries to kiss her ex KNOWING his current GF is around.

And then...instead of reacting with anger, as you should have because your ex was completely out of line...you hugged her and felt bad for her (which from your gf's point of view is you still having feelings for your ex)

People dont want to date people with intrusive or drama llama exes.

Cut the ex out completely and leave the past in the past

"Hi, Hmong girl chiming in whose fiancé is white. /u/whitegoldgreen is exactly correct! Luckily my parents are level-headed and aren't asking for a dowry, but I know people who went through very similar situations. Is she Christian or Shaman? That might influence why he wants what he wants. 

Hmong weddings are mostly a huge family &amp; friends reunion event to keep face, relations, for show and whatnot. Most of the invitees will be pretty irrelevant to the bride. You can do one if you want (we might), but don't feel obligated to. Me personally, if my dad did demand a dowry, I'd shut that shit down so quickly.

How does her brothers feel about the you-might-pay-for-their-wedding issue? If they're not traditional, they might be able to talk sense into their dad.

This is my experience/opinion, but from what I've seen women who get married are no longer considered part of the clan and when visiting family, considered guests. He might disown her, but I'm almost certain her family won't - not unless Dad has a stronghold on them too and they feel the need to follow his opinion. If anyone's tearing apart the family, it's her father."
"If tradition is so important to your FIL, let it be known that in your culture, the bride's family typically pays for the wedding.  If tradition is so important to him, then he should respect both your traditions and his - you will pay him $5k for his bride price, and he will pay the $x that you are spending on the wedding.

Okay, I know this won't actually work, but it might call his bluff?"
"And if the wife finds out some way later and he never told her? It's gonna look super shady. 

No. Getting in front of it is a way to show you have nothing to hide. Even something not shady you don't mention can look bad if you don't mention it up front. 

It'd be one thing if he wasn't already on thin ice. But since he is he needs to be SUPER open. Any little thing he doesn't mention looks significantly worse than if he gets in front of it.

But all in all, I always advocate for early disclosure. My boyfriend isn't the jealous type at all. I could be friends and hang out with exes and he wouldn't bat an eye. But I am super open and honest with him anyway. I've been open and honest when we've bumped into anyone I had previously had sex with. He doesn't care and often says I didn't even need to tell him. But I always respond that it's better I am up front. Because if he finds out later and I hadn't told him before it may look like I'm hiding things. And I would rather be up front than risk looking shady. Even though he trusts me to the end of the earth and back. 

OP owes his wife full disclosure while he rebuilds trust. He needs to tell her NOW.  "
Yes. Call security in the morning and ask for an escort after class. Email your professor that you are getting an escort and ask for the professor to wait until security gets there. Security can handle the reporting stuff if he is an employee. Sorry you have to deal with this!
So I obviously don't know what school you go to but I can pretty much guarantee every school in the country has a campus safety program to make you feel comfortable with your surroundings. You can call your campus polices non-emergency number and an officer will escort you or stay with you to make sure you're safe. Or there might be student orgs that will have students volunteer to come sit or escort you to make you safe. I do agree with the other comments to report him to the university but please don't assume that's the end of it. Have someone else there to make sure he doesn't try anything.
He violated your boundaries and bragged about it to your face. I'd say cut your losses.
"What sacrifices has he made till now?


Are you supposed to just play second fiddle to him forever? 



So say he becomes a fireman, you've supported him for almost a decade. And now you want something. Will he give it? Will he support you? You have no way of knowing, he never has. He might just leave, he's gotten years and years of money and favors out of you by then. "
So Julia is using future wedding invitations as a way to manipulate your brother into doing what she wants. Your brother is an idiot for not seeing through this.
I had chlamydia once upon a time. My partner and I had NO symptoms. I would urge him to get tested. You'll just end up passing it back and forth until you both get treated. 
"You're going to be a parent. This is good practice: everyone is going to think their way is right. 

Tell them straight up: Parents, my child's name is not a family decision. It is something between myself and my husband. We are making the choice ourselves. It's not up for discussion. 

So, once you enforce boundaries (you need to, sooner or later), would you consider it as your child's middle name? "
"""Dad, you need to tell Mom this. I want to meet my sister, and I'm not keeping any secrets. It's better if she hears it from you than from me.""

Of course, if your mother doesn't want any contact from your father, this is not a good idea."
"i thought they were high school aged too, jeez."
"I felt like a feral cat after giving birth. I was really concerned about being polite and letting everyone else experience the joy of new baby, I suppressed that cat so hard,  and everyone took a mile as soon as I gave an inch. You know what? SCREW THAT! Locate your inner fetal cat. Lean into that feeling. Be that feral cat mama! 

It's too bad women of your MIL's generation got the shit end of the stick in labor and delivery. They got bossed around and interfered with something terrible. Doesn't mean we haven't progressed and that you shouldn't be taking advantage of the chance to labor in a pool etc. 


You're not crazy. You got this :D


PS sorry I skipped over the husband thing. Sure he's terrified. But he's not the one actually doing it. On the other hand, that sort of frees him up to be even more terrified and helpless feeling. If you can afford it, get a doula as well as your midwife. The midwife is for YOU, the doula is for Y'ALL. She'll spell your husband, she'll make sure he stays hydrated while he's rubbing your back. She'll have the time your midwife might not to help calm him and explain what is happening in the moment. Very very helpful for both you and your partner. "
"I'd say get it over with quick and tell her to stop ASAP. No sense in letting it continue. Sit her down and be like ""hey, all the utensils and stuff are good for you to use, but the ingredients are a no go."""
"&gt; I wouldn't even abandon a stranger who was being harassed like you were.

Exactly. 

There was one time when I was in uni, when I saw this high school girl getting harassed by an older man at a bus stop. I came over and pretended I was her aunt without a second thought. 

She was almost in tears. "
"Verify documents, check and freeze credit, report banking cards as lost/compromised, etc. 

Depending on the state, if Clinger brings OPs social security card and official birth certificate to the DMV she can get a picture ID issued *with a picture of herself*.

There's no limit to what Clinger could do if she has all of the official copies of OPs documents."

"This sucks in a lot of ways, but I don't completely disagree with his kids. I don't care much more my dad's wife, she makes him happy, but if she was insistent on getting too much in my life as well as posting a crazy amount of crazy shit on instagram, I wouldn't want to see her either. Perhaps your mother needs to quit instagram and get some other therapy as well, then perhaps everyone can agree to a middle ground. 

I'm talking as someone who has steparents on both sidez that came into my life as a late teen/early adulthood. I don't consider them family, and they have no right to tell me how to behave or demand things. We stay cordial and friendly, but unfortunately for your mother, trying to push wanting to be a grandma so badly probably alienates them. "
"""My body is mine. Your body is yours. **I** am the one who gets to make decisions for my body. Not you, not anyone else. YOU do not get to make decisions about my body.""

His refusal to accept your ""no"" is a problem. It doesn't matter whether he is touchy feely and he thinks it's not a big deal. It matters that he ignores your choices and your feelings. Good partners don't do that. You can have different feelings about the situation and in a good relationship you might even have some arguments about it. But continuing to grope you when you have asked him to stop is just not OK. It's like he's trying to ""claim"" you or something. Gross."
"I'm a fat person.  Not like your roommate, but like a literal fat person.  Talking about this kind of topic is an emotional minefield and it's really easy to offend someone.

The best way, the literal best way is just to ask.  When she mentions something you pause and say something like this 

""you've asked me that before and I'm always a little unsure what to say.  I don't want to presume that I know all the answers and that I know your body.  At the same time, I've worked hard to keep myself at the weight that I am, it's not something that's come naturally.

So I'll return the question with a statement followed by a question. I love you just as you are, if you are really looking for my help I think I might be able to help you, but it's not going to be pleasant or fun.  So Do you REALLY want my advice or are you just looking to vent?  Because if you just want to vent, that's cool and I'm here to listen.""

Then if she says she wants advice..

""The way I see it is fairly simple.  You're active, not sedentary, however, lots of people gain weight in their low 20s.  There are lots of reasons for this but the main one is that it's the first time that they're away from home preparing their own meals and as a result, they eat poorly. Since you're an active person already, being more active is going to lose some weight, but not very much.  Stress and such have an impact for sure but by far the biggest impact on weight is diet.  Weight is like 90% diet and 10% everything else. 

Fixing a diet is hard so people often focus on fixing that remaining 10% and then wonder why they don't see results.  It's because you're playing around the edges and not addressing the core cause.

If you want to lose weight, you need to change the way you eat.  If you don't want to do that, I understand because it sure sucks sometimes, but if you don't then it's highly unlikely that anything you do will have any significant impact on your weight. 

Regardless of what you do, I love and support you and know that boyfriend does as well.  If you want my help making these changes that's cool and I'll offer advice, but actually doing it is the hard part and it has to be you who does it.  If you don't really want my help, that's cool as well.  I love you just as you are and am not at all interested in forcing my lifestyle or viewpoint onto others. "
"She is definitely acting in an emotionally heightened way. But she has spent the last three weeks sleeping with this puppy, feeding this puppy, taking work off to try to train it (this is pretty normal when you get a puppy btw.) And after all that work you informed her that she couldn't keep it. 

There were a lot of steps that could have taken place between ""puppy sleeps in the bed with us"" and ""puppy goes to shelter."" 
Did you talk about crate training? Getting a routine started to deal with separation anxiety? Her doing research on how to actually care for a puppy? i.e. her sleeping on the couch to be near it is absolutely not going to be good for the dog in the long run. 

How is everything else going in the relationship? Are you on the same page commitment wise, living arrangement wise, kid wise? It's possible this puppy was some sort of symbol of deepening shared responsibility to her and so took it as a bigger rejection than it is."
"&gt; People who carry a torch for their exes like that, they idealize the person. 

This exactly. He's idealized his ex and OP can't compete. OP is idealizing, too. Her boyfriend is ""perfect for her"" even though he's not only in love with his ex, but chasing after the ex in front of her. This isn't stand-up behavior and it definitely makes him *not the perfect guy* for OP (or anyone right now).

Both are putting their energies into unattainable relationships, but hopefully OP understands that now even if her boyfriend doesn't get that he's doing that with his ex-girlfriend."
"Agree with reporting her! What  a terrible thing to say, yes the girlfriend may have been abused in the past and that's why she is violent or whatever, but it's not okay for her to take it on OP and he certainly shouldn't be forced to deal with it and just ""try harder"". Wtf.

I've had therapists who were wrong for me but not anyone who gave such harmful advice."
"Congrats, you're renting a room with someone who hasn't grown up yet. Of course she's needy. Of course she's being picky. She basically gets a free ride on living situations while still getting her parents to help her out with her shit, and now she has a roommate who's all ""up in her space."" Literally sharing the same room. At least people who pay rent to live on their own get their own bedroom most of the time. 

If you're able to pay rent, then save up some money and move out. "
Sounds like he's jealous honestly
"Wow, based on the first paragraph I expected this to be a story about a bad roommate but that was a pleasant turn of events."
"Straight truth: You are a fucking moron if you agree to these terms.

Don't you see what she's doing? Every time she threatens a break up, you give in. She then moved the line, threatens breakup, you give in. If you give in on these demands, this won't be the end. She'll move the line again. 

You know how this ends?

She breaks up with you because you've allowed her to steal your heart and soul and now she has no respect for you. "
"sorry this is happening to you :(

Focus on your daughter. Maybe by helping her heal you can heal too. I am really sorry you are losing a daughter and family. Your daughter is still there, and you can still be in touch with your ex's family. Please know they are on your side, even if they still interact with your ex. Your daughter can still be their grandkid and niece, some day. Don't throw away relationships to good people who love your daughter if you can avoid it. :)

It is better that you found out. Hold on to that. Take time to be single. 

*hugs* from the internet, we are on your side."
He doesn't respect that you did what you needed to do in order to pick up his slack? That his choices put you in a position of having to take a job that is not ideal? He should be grateful and supportive instead of snarky and prideful. He needs to get off his ass and start contributing to the relationship like you have.
"Respectfully, your conjecture about your landlord is right -- because you are being very naive because of your age.

What she's doing is literally breaking and entering. She may be your landlord but that does not give her any more right to waltz into your apartment unannounced than any other stranger. It's only been a week and she's already done this three times and been highly invasive all three times. Don't be mistaken -- this will continue and it WILL escalate. Right now she's testing you.

What will be next? She'll get mad because you left your laundry on the floor? Because she doesn't like your decor. Will she come in and find a used condom and tell you you can't have boys over? Or go prying through your medicine cabinet (if she hasn't already? I'm sure she has). What if she walks in on you in the shower or naked or in the middle of sex (if you're seeing someone)?

This is highly illegal, highly invasive and highly creepy. i would strongly advise you to contact a lawyer -- they will likely recommend a cease and desist letter -- and do not tolerate any more of this. If she does this again, confront her and tell her she is breaking the law and is not permitted in your apartment without permission. You are not being confrontational -- she is by breaking the law. And right now you're a total doormat."

I suppose it's easy to be cavalier over a stranger's life over the internet, but that doesn't make it good advice. If she's looking for validation that she doesn't need to give her husband ""closure"" after he's treated her like shit for years on end, what good does it do to speculatively or hypothetically say it might turn out ok if she confronts him? She doesn't even want to do that and isn't asking about that. "

"My crazy MIL was a lactation consultant-- at least, she trained as one, but was never able to hold down a job as one because she shamed the new mothers and gave incorrect advice.

You should scream and cry and yell and whatever is necessary to get what you want!"
"You already told his wife that his behavior was unacceptable, and from the way the other neighbors behave, it sounds like other people are fed up with his behavior too.

It is possible to be polite and neighborly enough without really engaging them. "
"You said you almost never decline his sexual advances. So on one of the fi4st times you asserted your autonomy, he pushed your boundaries.

Tell him bluntly and straightforwardly and unambiguously that you are not interested, that you will never be interested, and that he needs to fuck off or you will call the police. Do it in a public place with people who have been warned that you're about to tell off your stalker. Make sure they have instructions to call the police if he reacts badly and if they ever see him come near you again."

"A professor can speak to university police or security, as well as help this student find options for reporting this behavior.  The professor also may be able to corroborate the OP's story if he/she observes the behavior.  While you and many other faculty may not feel comfortable approaching the guy, you also wouldn't have to in order to get involved.  Her professor could also work with OP to make sure she is not left alone when she is walking to the parking lot or waiting for he ride.  Her professor could ask colleagues if they've had students facing similar issues.  Her professor could speak to an office dealing with student welfare, like whichever office on their campus deals with reporting students they perceive to be in need of mental health services, or the Office of Civil Rights.

While it is not the professor's job to aid the student, many professors I know would much rather help a student navigate a difficult situation like this than have a student forced to face something like this on their own."

"&gt; So two questions. One, am I overreacting about this?

No, I don't think you are at all.

No, I think this is a good way to get a bratty, entitled kid in the long run.

&gt; And two, what should I do? My gut response is to tell her, fine. If I'm such a terrible uncle maybe you should find someone else to babysit. 

I wouldn't put it like that. What I would say is that if you aren't going to be allowed to set reasonable boundaries for the kid, you can't be a good babysitter and that she needs to find someone else.  Preferably someone who isn't a family member and therefore won't get uninvited from family events at the whim of a seven year old.

If the party hasn't happened yet, you might also want to give your parents a heads up that you won't be there and why, just so they are aware and don't ask questions.  Your sister is going to look petty and she might make up a lie to save face. "

"I am a mom whose vagina was permanently altered from childbirth. My husband and I are still trying to figure things out sexually after 5+ years. There have been too many times where I felt horrendous about myself as a woman and wife especially after we try to have sex. We were also on the verge of divorce because my husband did not handle becoming a father well AT ALL. The thing that saves our marriage is that we saves us is that 1) I heard the advice to not make any decisions about the relationship until the youngest is in Kindergarten. Things get easier especially when you can get consistent sleep again. 2) We were best friends before and still are so sex is not what holds us together. 

The physiotherapist will help a lot. One big no no for women who lift weights is to hold your breath lifting which is a big recommendation nowadays. This puts a ton of pressure on the pelvic floor. You'll just need to rehab it. Prolapses are far from a death sentence and sex/orgasms actually is one thing that helps. Hip thrusters and kettlebell swings are good for pelvic floor rehab. But do a search for post-partum fitness. There are people that know the fitness world and how post-partum changes the way you work out.

Your wife needs some serious therapy for your family to stay whole, and it's going to hurt your daughter the most, especially since it seems like she's targeted her mishaps/short fallings to attack. Your daughter is young, naive, gullible, and changing- if you guys only attack and punish her, she will begin to hide things from both of you instead of being up front. I can tell you now, you do not want a young daughter who has already dabbled in drunken drinking to get angry, feel betrayed by her parents, and then develop a habit of doing what she wants without you guys knowing about it. Honestly? Set a line with your wife. Tell her she SHOULDN'T come home until she figures out what relationship she wants with her daughter, because she's quickly destroying it and it is HARD to rebuild. Best of luck."
"Thank you. I am DEFINITELY going to check that podcast out, it sounds like something I need to listen to. "
"Yeah ok, you got me there. I just didn't want to admit it. He doesn't try daily to contact me on facebook, but any time I make an update he makes a comment on it as an excuse to say something. 

All the messages I've been getting is sorta showing me it isn't ok and that I've just been accepting it for the past 3 years, but I shouldn't have to. So thank you all.

I just never thought it was harassment as there's a handful of customers who hang about regularly to chat to me, but I don't get a bad feeling off them, just this fella. 

Customers behind him in the line always make a comment on him, usually his smell, after he leaves. Or calls him a creep."
It may seem that way to you. But you have to understand thar your perceptions about other people's behavior toward you don't always match up with reality.
"Working out does sometimes give you stretch marks.  It sounds like other things he does could produce bruising or other pressure marks.

You have no affirmative reason to doubt him.  So I would trust him."
"They don't really change, they just hide it by focusing on a different abuse target until they're ready to reveal their true selves.

EG: maybe they tease their siblings or their parents, maybe make snide remarks about exes, or they're rude to waitstaff or other service industry workers. This allows them to present their best side to their longer term victim until they know they have full control eg: proposal, wedding, pregnancy, etc."
"Your friends and family gave you what sounds like unanimous feedback about the problem, but it seems like you don't want to believe it.  There is so much space between being passive and waiting around for men to chase and woo you and keeping on doing exactly what you have been.  You can be proactive without being pushy.  Learn to let a relationship find its own flow and learn to actually enjoy the beginning stages of a relationship instead of trying to engineer it.  "
"Wanting a reason is completely and utterly human. We like to find familiar things and patterns in our lives, we like to understand things, maybe learn from where we went wrong. If we don't know, how can we learn?

But ultimately, the reason isn't important. There probably isn't a simple why. It's probably a whole shit-show of stuff. Getting a reason can feel cathartic, but often it doesn't actually make the moving on process any easier. You'll just have more questions.

Like you said. *Really*, the reason doesn't matter, even though it feels like it does. 

I mean at least this way around you get to choose the reason yourself and use it as a way to improve or make your life better."
What a bunch of idiots. What the hell is the point of this?
"How are the household duties divided?  I've observed that women tend to get stuck with most of the daily tasks to keep the house running.  After a full shift of their day job and then coming home to a second shift, there just isnt enough mental energy left to pursue interests that require a high level of engagement."
"&gt; We have all told her we do not support her, which is why she did not tell us she was bringing him to dinner.

So she disregarded all your opinions and shoved him into your family anyway? Damn, that girl is disrespectful on so many levels.

&gt; she says she already loves the child and can't wait to be involved with her

I bet the mother will do anything to try to keep her from that child.

Your sister sounds psycho."
"You've already tried to address this nicely, and Kim has utterly and completely ignored your very-clear, very-reasonable boundaries about having guests in the house alone. It's not like she forgot the rule; she knows and doesn't care and will continue to do what she wants until you either relax the rule, or you all get robbed blind one day. She doesn't seem to have a lot of turnover with new men, so the next time you kick out Theo (and there will be a next time), let him know that he needs to leave with Kim. Maybe Theo will have more respect for the house than Kim. Repeat with the next guy. 

Does your lease have any rules about overnight guests or any process for the four of you to remove her from the lease and kick her out? In college, my friends talked to the landlord and almost kicked out one of 8 housemates for nonpayment of rent and generally being disgusting. However, I think that the landlord was able to get involved due to the nonpayment of rent. At any rate, I would definitely not renew a lease with her."

"He reminds me of my friend's husband, who seems to have never heard that young children can be challenging and require patience, or that parenting books are a thing. They started couples therapy with a child development specialist and she said it's really helping him understand their kids' behavior and deal with home life. They also talk about their marriage, of course...she seems happier since they started going.

Edit: OP, I saw below that you said you don't leave your kid with babysitters because your husband won't agree to it-- my friend and her husband have a mandated date night every two weeks. Doctor's orders!"
"Woman with hypothyroidism here.  OP needs to be understanding - after I had my thyroid removed I gained 20lbs in six months while my doctor and I dialed my meds in.  It took a long time - over a year - to get my levels perfect.... and when we did it was like night and day.  

Now, I'm on a good diet and am at a lower weight than I was before surgery.  No diet in the world would have worked before my meds were right.

Be patient, OP.  Balancing meds can be tricky."
"First of all, he posted a conversation with you publicly along with a caption that resented you. That is really mean and if that behavior came from my boyfriend, I'd break up with him before that snap story expired (quicker than that). What kind of 30 year old man would do that?! Seems to me like you were an annoyance to him and good fucking riddance. You deserve way better OP. "
Anything that you can pawn? It's not a great option but better then payday loans. 
"&gt; I mean, at this point, they shoulder some blame here.

Yes, but not because they were 'greedy and selfish' for choosing to further their careers and enjoy life before getting bit by the baby bug. You *have* to have heard of couples realizing they want kids after, y'know, seeing other kids, right? ""Baby rabies""? This is a common thing, and it's not deserving of the kind of judgement you're doling out. 

Their kid is messed up - but not because they didn't have him for the ""right"" reasons, or because they waited. They *do* shoulder blame, but not for that. 

They shoulder the blame for not addressing the issues as they arose, they shoulder the blame for not listening to anyone who told them that their kid needs help, and they shoulder the blame for sticking their heads in the sand. Seriously OP, cool it with the morality masturbation and keep it to what the issue actually is - how you can keep yourself safe and set up actual boundaries, while maybe getting through to these knuckleheads at the same time. Just, whatever you do, don't bring up that you think they couldn't ""have been more reckless"" because they waited, or that you think wanting a kid after seeing people close to them have kids is an invalid desire. Yikes. 

Hopefully you get some guidance here on how to set up boundaries, and maybe once they realize people are pulling away from them, they'll get that kid help before he seriously hurts someone. "
"Ok, you're missing the big picture here.

You're so focused on this one particular trip. But you are completely ignoring the problem, that *your family* doesn't make *your wife* feel welcome.

You are not standing by your wife. You are throwing her to the wolves to get eaten alive. If you're leaving this trips thinking everything went wonderfully, and she had the complete opposite experience, then you have a major problem here, and it's mostly your fault.

What is it about your wife that your family doesn't like? What happened between your wife and your sister-in-law won't even be in the same room as her? If your parents are the ones extending the invites to come, why does your sister-in-law gets to dictate who can and can't come?  Why are you ignoring your wife so much on these vacations?

To be quite honest, based on your post, your family sounds like a bunch of assholes, and obviously the apple didn't fall too far from the tree in your case. You're failing your wife, and you're failing your marriage. You are asking an unbelievable amount of your wife, and you're giving her nothing in return.

You need to set some reasonable boundaries with your family. If they don't treat your wife with respect, then you won't be coming around until things are settled between your wife and the rest of the family. "
You're 19. The relationship was short. He cheated on you. The answer is pretty clear.
"I will focus on the situation and not your short engagement. If she's brought up micromanaging with you before this definitely falls under that umbrella. If she says she's ""got it"" then trust her that she's got it handled and don't worry about it. To her, peeking over to see what's happening after she says she has it handles looks like you don't trust her to handle a simple situation. Even if that's not what you mean to do, that's what it comes across as especially if this is something you do often. Trust that if she needs or wants your help that she will ask for it. 

For your other questions, there's no solid answer for those because every relationship is different. These are things that you have to figure out as the relationship grows. And since there may be some communication errors in this relationship, I'll just add to make sure you also discuss the big things like money and kids before tying the knot. "
"I hate to tell you, but this is emotional abuse. It's subtle and low key, but he's undermining your confidence in your self.

&gt;his response was that knowledge is power and he just wants the best for me.

This is all you need to know - he doesn't give a shit that he's lowering your confidence, hurting your feelings or whatever. He knows ""best"".

The truth is, this guys is making you feel bad. The future you see with him is going to be full of that bad feeling. There are plenty of people out there who will love you for YOU, rather than scolding or chiding you for the person that you are. "
"Same. I was like, come on, why would you tell someone everything you did every day?! Emily is crazy. He probably meets people for lunch several times a week! 

Yeah, that's what someone who has never been in a serious relationship thinks. "
"Attorney. Now.

While your job certainly sounds stressful, let's face it, any man who would act like your husband is acting  was going to cheat no matter what - all he needed was a convenient excuse to blame it on you when he did."
"I agree. I guess the something he is feeling is a little attraction because duh super fit naked 25 year old. 

The actual problem is the cousin. "
"&gt; he tries to hold me down and pass of me struggling as just playing around or faking it

He's this close to raping you.

Don't have sex with someone you don't trust. If he pushes you too far one of these days, you'll be dealing with trauma for a while. Don't risk it."
The fact he snooped your phone at random after having a big gathering is a little suspect to me as well. A lot of the time when we see one partner develop a sudden suspicion it's a reflection of their own guilty conscience.
"For your marriage to be healthy, he believes it's more important for you to wear yellow gold than it is for you to be happy. 

Do you see how ridiculous that is? A good marriage has nothing to do with rings, but it has everything to do with communication and compromise, and a desire to make your partner happy. "
I know this is pretty basic but have you ever Googled him? It may be public information. I really feel like finding out is important.
"I agree with this. My only beef with the wife is that she's complaining about his sisters irresponsible actions as the reason to not help her when they literally bailed her loser brother out of jail who apparently can barely manage to stay out. If she doesn't want the burden of an extra child that's fine but she needs to get off her high horse about her own family cause her brother is worse trash than OP's troubled sister.

Edit- just found out it was a $50,000 bond they took out on her brother because she demands full control of the finances even though she makes poor decisions like that without asking him. They have a lot more issues than this relatively minor one. "
He is trying to make sure you have someone to talk to so you can get out of this abusive relationship. He is actually being a decent human being.   
I actually assume this is the case. But she still did it without consideration of OP's feelings on the matter.
"If she thinks bullying her way into your delivery room is a good idea, she was NOT a good l&amp;d nurse. If she thinks ignoring the wishes of a vulnerable post partum woman is a good idea, she definitely was not a good nurse. If she thinks pregnancy makes women irrational and not know what is best for them, than she really was not a good nurse whatsoever. 

Or she just ignores what she knows from training and experience because her wants trump your needs. 

Now the question is what your husband puts first: wife and baby's needs or mommy's wants? 

Show him this thread. "
"My husband is also in the Air Force. We had something similar happen where I was worried about him and he just didn't call or text me because he was having a great time with the boys. I blew up. And it was for a much shorter length of time and I was worried that he was missing not that a hurricane might have got him. You aren't overreacting. 

We all decide what we're comfortable with in our relationships. A lot of other military wives will probably comment and say not having contact is just part of this lifestyle. I disagree. OP, imagine if he was deployed and just decided to not talk to you sometimes? Could you handle that? We can all be understanding of when they can't contact us but how well can you handle him choosing to blow off steam over contacting you? 

Does he have a history of communication problems? While my husband and I were apart our relationship was never tested more. His communication was awful. I made him a huge priority. I scheduled my days around when we could talk and sent him care packages. I did my best to let him know he was loved. When that wasn't reciporacated- we struggled. 

I've made it very clear to my husband that shitty communication will not fly. He's improved. He's careful to check in and let me know he's safe. He understands that a lack of effort to communicate is something that will end our relationship- deployed or not. Communication makes me feel love and appreciated so he's doing his best to meet that need. 

Sorry for the long post but I just really want you to be aware of what you're jumping into. Being a military spouse is hard. Are you willing to make that harder by being with someone who doesn't seem to value communication with you? "
It's definitely harassment! And creepy as fuck. Give your manager a heads up. It'll go much smoother if you tell him now what's going than if the customer comes in and creates a scene. But I think it's clear everyone knows this dude is a pervy creep and you won't lose your job. 
"OK then, live with the problem I guess?  "
"I second this. My mom brought home bed bugs once and refused to acknowledge it. It was six months before I convinced her to do anything about it. I still have nightmares about it. We lost a couch and a sofa and ours were pretty mild. 

I also recommend getting a cover for your mattress to help protect it. "
"Funny, that's my default out if invited to church service.  ""Thank you, that's very kind, but I'll burst into flames"".

That does not apply to weddings, funerals or grad parties.  I don't get this woman.  

Maybe she is more like an anti-theist than an atheist.  They can get quite hostile."
"&gt; His response to this was basically that he'd asked but I'd said I didn't have anything special planned (I don't remember this exact conversation, but it's possible it happened because I was trying to keep the surprise party secret.)

This is a lesson for the future. Adults make plans, it's as simple as that. If you want someone to keep a time slot open and not make other plans, you have to be open about the fact that you are making plans. In this instance, you could have told him 'Yes, but I want to keep the details as a surprise' and this issue wouldn't have arisen. 

You invested too much into the concept of a 'surprise party'- something that doesn't really work out in reality the way it does in movies- and now you're being shirty with him over your bad planning.

&gt; I haven't spoken with him since early Sunday morning and I really don't know how to stop being mad at him.
Do I have any sort of point or am I just being too sensitive?

Stop sulking like a child and go apologize to your husband for your shitty behavior."
"&gt; Whenever he drinks, he gets mean, nasty, and does things he regrets. 

So he's a mean drunk

&gt; he then told me I am a ""sick person"" because I haven't forgiven him. 

So he's maniplative while sober. 

&gt; Do I stay or do I go?

Stay if you want a lifetime of disappointment or a costly divorce "
Seriously.  I'm utterly confused by OP.  This is one of the few cases where the guy was entirely honest about what was going on up front.  
"Time for your cousin to be out of the house.  No ifs, ands, or buts, she needs to be gone ASAP. Hopefully he's just getting an ego boost out of it but couples counseling might be necessary."
"He loves you so much that he went out, willingly got drunk, willingly danced with another girl, and willingly made out with her in front of everyone.  

If you can't trust him to go out to bars without you - FOR TWO MORE YEARS - you're going to have a hard time making this relationship work.  "
Tomorrow you get in your car like you're going to work and you go to your dad's house. Then you never go back. That's how.
"I agree with everything you're saying. I feel like ""what the fuck"" is the only appropriate response. Like, you made your bed. She didn't ask for any of this. I get that he's struggling as well, and that is valid, but nonetheless she (and his child) are unwitting victims of this situation. He can't choose his sexuality, but he could choose not to pressure his wife into having kids, and he could choose not to cheat on her, either."
"Everyone else is giving really good advice, so I'll address the last little bit about you and your fiancé. 

Treat your sister like a roommate. She can pick up after herself. Feed herself. Entertain herself. And she can wear some damn headphones while you and your fiancé have sex in your home. 

You and your fiancé shouldn't let her run your life and ruin that one glorious week that you are on the same schedule.

"
"Pull the whole ""Well, if I am going to respect your culture, you better respect mine. I'll pay the $5k for that wedding, so you have to pay for your daughter's wedding because it is tradition in my culture that the bride's family pay for all wedding costs."" "
"&gt; He was making the whole thing about himself, because if he was really trying to be nice for her birthday ( despite their agreement not to do anything) he would have surprised her with something she liked, not something he thought was going to derail her progress. 

Exactly. He didn't try at all--in fact, he went out of his way to be antagonistic. "
"&gt; to reflect that your money goes to whatever charity when you pass, just in case they are ruthless of the extreme sort. Then when you marry and/or have children you can change it so that your spouse/kids inherit. As of right now, should you pass away your mom and siblings are your next-of-kin. Without any chance whatsoever of getting your money it will prove clear what their true intentions are.

Brillant :)"
"Yeah I'm gonna be frank. You are a young female 2L so they're gonna shit on you as much as possible. Support staff do this ALL. THE. TIME. Not all of them, but holy shit, there are a lot of women who take it really fucking personally that young female lawyers breathe air. I've heard administrative staff complain that they're hotter than (new young female attorney hire) and they don't see why (new hire) is getting work from (male partner). No basis whatsoever for whatever the fuck they're bitching about. Has happened to so many of my female attorney friends, though not all. Meanwhile my fellow male associates get fawned over by their female support staff, eyeroll. 

I'd honestly start replying to them in English in the mildest of tones about what they were talking about, that's enough to shut up most people. Going to the boss, eh. Honestly, they already know their office manager is a gigantic jerkface gossip, it's apparently a requirement for law firms. The most you can reasonably demand is that these people don't do it around you, to your face. 

If they escalate after revealing you understand them (and btw, I wouldn't engage them at all about how much Spanish you know), then you may have no choice but to take it to your boss. You have a good chance then because you said everyone is nice. You gotta play it by ear."
"If mom signed away parental rights she can no longer have a say or custody of your daughter. 

Mom has been absent and made it clear she doesn't want to be part of your lives. I wouldn't allow her to suddenly wisk in and take her away. 

She needs to understand she has no connection with your daughter and needs to put time into building a relationship. Maybe you three can all go do something together that Maya likes. Like going to the zoo so your wife can get to know her. WITHOUT throwing your child's sense of stability out of whack.

Also. Serve those divorce papers. You two can still be good parents even if you're not married. Don't tie yourself to someone you don't want to be with anymore. "
"What he did was wrong.  It's nothing to do with culture &amp; it sounds like he is just using that as an excuse.   Break up with him and get a new dog.  Life will be much easier! 

Plus, if you do break up, that's between you and him.  No one else, so I wouldn't worry about what others think as it's irrelevant. "
[deleted]
"Yes! I can't imagine dealing with a newborn and having to be a guest in someone else's home, when you're exhausted and feeling so gross because of all the after birth stuff and constant breastfeeding. OP should be going to her place and helping out with meals/cleaning.

Edit: And it would be safer for the baby to not be around other kids, not until it's immune system is a bit more robust."
"I have borderline personality disorder. At my absolute WORST (which could be pretty bad) I wouldn't do what she did and I would have thought she was insane for it. 

It's fantastic that you're willing to be open minded about her having BPD. It's a heavily stigmatized disease and a lot of people who run their mouths about it are actually really uninformed. But I would strongly suggest learning for yourself what BPD really is about and don't let anyone use it to justify behavior like this. "
"He has a history of treating you badly, has cheated on you before, and caused a scene and threatened you when you discovered him cheating. What is there to ""salvage""?

It's time to care about yourself, not what he wants. Do you really care so little for yourself and your own comfort, happiness, and future that you're willing to stay with someone who treats you badly and only apologizes when they realize the whole street now knows they're a scumbag? What if you froze and didn't run? What if he had hurt you or even killed you?

Stop worrying about if he wants to get back with you. Yes, he's a total asshole and surely you know that and know what you need to do next. You should be scared of him and scared of the miserable life you're looking at if you decide to stay with him."
"My brother is a few years younger than me, and if this happened I could totally see myself telling a close friend about it. I PROMISE you it wasn't malicious. I'm not sure why your sister's friend thought it would be appropriate to bring it up to her brother. That was pretty shitty on her part. Regardless, I understand why you might feel embarrassment (even though you shouldn't).

Anyway, your friends fucking suck dude. No solid friend or real man would make their friend feel like shit for experiencing natural human emotions, especially in the wake of a RELATIVE'S DEATH. I know you think they're your friends, but you might want to think about branching out to new ones. How does it feel to know that if something terrible happens in your life, you can't depend on your friends to provide any help or support? Just to laugh at you. Pretty sad."
so she's been stealthily poisoning you on the regular like some *Flowers In The Attic* shit. she wants you to have acid damage and cancer? 
"Hah well in all their minds the big difference is that a baby is the end result of birth unlike a prostate exam, so it's different. A LOT of people have this attitude, it's crazy to me."
"My friend's mom had a complete breakdown at work and was given the Baker Act as well. She wasn't suicidal, she just was under so much stress at home and at work that's she finally snapped. She said she spent the entire time she was there either talking to therapists or coloring. They sent her home with a prescription for anti-depressants and now when she gets upset, she sits down at the kitchen table and colors."
"If you think a child is being abused, call your local CPS (child protective services) and make a report. "
"Why is everyone bullshitting you about your decisions?


Neither your boyfriend nor your family can make you choose anything. "
"&gt;Or has anyone had a similar experience?

Yes. I had a boyfriend shame me because he was my 8th.  His was 60+ (couldn't give an exact number).  

I didn't even ask his number, care about his number, or particularly want to tell him mine, but he just decided to tell me his and then guilted me into telling him mine because I knew his and it was ""only fair"" if he knew mine as well. 

We were both 25 or 26 at the time, can't remember exactly.

He was an all around asshat and ended up being abusive to boot."
"pfff honestly i would consider having an abortion and leaving the dude, i dont believe the assault story for a second, i'm sorry.

i think in this case the simplest solution is the right one, he got intoxicated, got laid and got the lady pregnant, with the help of a friend.


this whole thing looks like a shitfest, i don't think you deserve it, run."
"I agree with this until the very last part.  On the sister's part, this seems completely non-malicious and the sister simply didn't understand that OP wanted this kept private (which is a totally reasonable thing to want).   It seems punitive and kind of self-destructive to say something like ""you won't come to her..."", when it may be more accurate and constructive to say something like ""I want to share these moments but I'm having trouble...""

After that, it just takes time. From OP's post they may be at this point already though. "
"It's not needy if you're exclusive.

""Hey, I noticed you still have the app on your phone.  Just curious as to why, since we both decided on exclusivity.  I deleted my app once we made that decision, and I thought it was something we'd both be doing."""
"It is not even the whole 'looks bad on paper' thing. If step siblings start dating, then have a bad breakup, it affects the whole family for possibly the rest of their lives. It's kinda like dating people you work with, except you can't exactly find a new family like you can find a new job if things go south."
"You're still his jailer. You shouldn't have to allow or forbid what he ingests. He should be doing that himself. You're not his mom. It's pretty clear you aren't really okay with what happened and haven't been able to move past it. If you can't move past it, you should break up with him. If you TRUST him enough to not do it again, then you should let him live his life and believe him."
Call your landlord and tell them this.  They can help figure out a solution since they don't want unauthorized people in their unit either.
"I am sorry to say this, but your marriage is over. 

You did everything you could to try to make things work, but him going back to the same woman is a sign that he'll never stop, and you deserve better. 

Go see a lawyer, and get ready to leave/divorce him. 

"
"I think this situation really depends on what story is accurate. 

If your husband called you a bitch, and non-violently moved you out of his way, and was apologetic about after the fact, and your sister did exaggerate the situation, it is a problem with your sister than needs to be addressed. Family means so much but you choose to be with this man. If it were me, I would withdrawal from the relationship with my sister until she could learn to respect my marriage. Maybe that doesn't mean cutting her off completely but, it is really disrespectful to your husband that it is occurring. 

If your husband truly is abusive and your family is reaching out as a life line, you need to take it. "
"What struck me about your story was that when you confronted him, he dismissed you and went after her.  You were upset, she wasn't.  And he didn't care how you felt enough to try and reach her some other time.

I hate the 'dump him' responses on here, but this is one of those times.  Read 'he's just not that into you'.  It's a cliche now and may seem cheesy, but it's crystal clear that this guy is not into you.  That won't change over time.  He won't suddenly develop the same feelings.  He WILL leave you as soon as he finds someone he is into who wants him back.  You WILL find someone who wants you."
"&gt;Cutting her off completely would be such a waste.

Please google ""sunk-cost fallacy"".

Don't invest another minute in this dumpster trash.

&gt;Even though she did what she did. Even though I know that its best for her to not be a part of my life, Kimmy is like my daughter.

The person you view as a daughter **actively tried to seduce your husband!**

She doesn't give two shits about you, she wants to fuck your husband and *replace you* as his woman.

####Stop thinking of her as a little girl and giving her passes! What she did was unacceptable and nothing she can say can excuse her actions.

You mentioned in another comment that Kimmy is part of the reason why you didn't pursue starting a family. Maybe when the dust has settled you can look into fostering or adopting kids who need a home. Find a way to move forward together and close this chapter of you life with Kimmy. She destroyed the ""daughter/little sister"" dynamic when she decided to get naked and sit in your husband's lap..

Also would note, an idea you can do right now in the short term: maybe you can start a fitness routine and doing exercises *with your husband*. Pursue this interest together as a way to improve your health and spend time together having an active lifestyle. It could make your marriage stronger and help move pass this awful period in your lives."
"People like this usually fall into two camps 

1. They've been wronged in the past/had experiences that would make them be quick to be paranoid and untrustworthy of others

2. They're untrustworthy and have been unfaithful in the past /currently/or likely to be 

If we assume it's the first. He needs you to be blunt in that he needs to understand you're not ok with such ridiculous questions. You're not ok to be made to feel bad for nothing. 
It's not your fault he has trust issues. He should work at getting past them.

Good luck.

Just for fun you should sneakily stain his trousers and accuse him of having another guys cum on him. "
"Well you've got to get her a blue french horn now. 

Apologise and laugh."
"Yeah, complete double standards. She sounds like the type who will demand he does all the ""man stuff"" around the house, and then call him sexist if he wants her to cook and clean."
"Sure, but if someone just recently lost over a *hundred pounds*, that big cake doesn't look sweet, it probably looks like the enemy. Sure, tactless, but in no way deserving of the response. He's trying to drag her down, and when she wouldn't have it, he lost it. Because he knows he's losing her, and he's just pushing her out the door at this point."
"Accidents like that can traumatize kids for life. I think as a parent you should be trying to minimize trauma, but what do I know.

It also wasn't an accident, he deliberately prevented her from using the washroom. There's been a few posts here detailing SOs doing that to their partner as a form of abuse. If you search them up you can find great info as to why it's so damaging in the comments."
"No one knows what he'll do and theres no good reason you should try and convince him to leave. At this point, you have to accept that your past is completely a deal breaker for some people. If it is for him, so be it. You will find people who dont care and those who do. Only time will tell. If anything, you should probably tell him yourself. That way he isnt told by the other frat bros that you had a 7 way."
"Man, I hear you. There's a weird internet-generation gap for the selfie that I think some very slightly younger folks might not get. During ye olde era of myspace, you were likely going to be made fun of for having more selfies than photos with friends. People were actively made fun of for changing their profile picture too often. 

The slightly younger crowd has had snapchat/instagram which I think has made it much more socially acceptable. It's basically the equivalent of a status update. When my SO's little brother was staying with us I never felt 4 years age difference so acutely. He was attached to his phone constantly. He would do it during dinner, movies, while his girlfriend was over, and would fall asleep with it in his hand. He would use texting or snapchatting to communicate time-sensitive information... not realizing that my SO and I are not constantly checking our phones. And I don't necessarily think that they're wrong - but it doesn't change how it makes you feel. 

I think rather than feeling ashamed of your husband, just tell him it makes you feel uncomfortable and disconnected from him when he's focusing on his phone. Communicate that maybe certain things are selfie-worthy occasions, but sometimes you'd rather just enjoy the time with him and the people you're with. 

This means the occasional concession on your part - sometimes the phone is going to come out. Sometimes our spouses are going to have habits or hobbies that irritate the shit out of us... but you can't control or change it. But you can ask for compromises."
"Yeah, that's a highly micro-managed approach. Not good.

I setup a similar system many years ago in order to facilitate opening a new office. We had staff on site, but it was mostly new hires, so we had a drop-in video conf running all day, as well a eboards and such just so the staffs could get a feel for each other and have some face time. 

Going to the desktop though? That's a bit much. There are way better ways to achieve the same result.

Another poster made a very salient point - you really don't get a say in terms of being a ""hard no"". Fact is, the company owns your workspace so you have to follow that if you want to stay with the company. And the chances of this lasting for any amount of time are slim.

If you feel that strongly about it, your best option is to look for a position elsewhere. If anything, this is a culture that won't fit for you, and honestly sounds pretty toxic in general."
"I've seen versions of this post with Yui, Mugi, and now Mio as the anime girl in question. I wonder when we'll get Ritsu and Azusa, or if I've missed those posts. "
I'm guessing OP is the type to avoid direct conflict and stew over it instead. 
"Agreed. I can't entirely relate because I'm definitely an emotional person, but in emergency situations (of which I've been in several - OD first response, mom having a pseudo heart attack, suicide response, etc) I *shut emotions down*. They don't help me do what I need to do, and it's a completely involuntary response. 

The pseudo heart attack happened just a week or so ago and a friend called in the middle of it and later said ""I knew it was serious when I got Arden's robot boring voice.""

So, if I can experience that then it's entirely believable to me that someone else can do the same scaled up to every day situations. I really don't see any issue with moving through stressful situations analytically then reflecting on the experience later which is what it sounds like he does. "

"So your feelings are not wrong at their root. You want a healthy sexual relationship with your partner, from your perspective you don't have one, that's upsetting to you. 100% fair and reasonable. Unfortunately for you, her being not in the mood is also 100% fair and reasonable. Guilting her and pushing consensual boundaries however, is not fair or reasonable, especially after a physical connection has already been made that day and you know your partner's drive is lower than yours. You just don't get to get mad and pick a fight with someone because they get too tired to fuck.

"I feel like people who choose something *this* expensive without input from the person who actually has to wear the thing are extremely misguided. Worse, they seem to think that how much you like the ring is symbolic of your love and devotion...that's a lot of fucking pressure to put on a piece of jewelry.

My husband and I picked out a ring together. "
"Number 1 is really significant. A couple of years ago I thought I was pregnant, and I was so stressed out about not getting my period that it stopped it from starting, which is so ironic. Pregnancy tests are really reliable - a doctor's test wouldn't be significantly better. Just breathe and try and keep your body in a regular routine."

"Allen fucked up. That situation would have upset me as well. Your infant could have been hurt. If this was anyone other than a brother, I would cut him out of my life. Since he is family and seems remorseful, perhaps in time you could work something out. Do you think this would have happened without the alcohol involved? I am not insinuating that he is not responsible for his actions, inebriated or not. What if he never drank in your presence again? I think he is not someone I could easily trust and certainly not with my kids. I just think people make mistakes. Because he is family, I would consider at some point trying to offer an olive branch. There is no way that I would want to give up a relationship with my whole husband's family because of one person, especially if that person was genuinely apologetic. I would need to see some effort on their part, though, to right the wrong. "
"My mom's family is super Irish Catholic, and if my brother assaulted someone while drunk at a family gathering, you can bet my grandparents and parents would expect him to abstain front then on when that person was going to be around.

"Do the hard thing and keep standing up to her when she abuses your child.  I know, that doesn't sound fun, but the alternative is to split up.

"In this case I'd trust him. It's entirely possible to get scratches doing work outs and not notice. The fact that they'd have to be so deep is a sign it wasn't nails, and that he doesn't have an explainable reason is a point in his favour - cheaters are likely to be prepared with an excuse for if you catch on."

"I usually dont comment on these threads, but there are too many people telling you that it's your fault for me not to weigh in with my own opinion.  There are a lot of people here telling you that you're in the wrong for not being excited about his gift.  Your paleo diet is not a new thing.  He should've known better than to get you something that goes against your diet.  I understand that his feelings were probably hurt when you didn't respond the way he wanted you to, but that's what happens when you get someone a thoughtless gift.  Also his reaction is entirely unacceptable!  He called you a slut!  He accused you of cheating on him based on ZERO evidence.  He sounds terribly insecure, and if I were you, I'd leave him.  "
"Why on earth would you move in with someone so soon? It being affordable isn't an excuse for putting yourself in such a precarious position. Honestly that is a red flag in and of itself.

And now, you're saying you'll take in your niece if your sister refuses to? So you mean you're going to make your wife take care of another child without her consent. 

Let's face it. You can say how much you're gonna help with the kids, but the bulk of the work will be done by your poor wife. That is not fair for her. I hope you'd at least talk to your wife about that possible matter instead of saying ""yeah Imma take her in no matter what"". Jesus. You think just because your wife is a SAHM doesn't mean she should be okay with taking care of another child that doesn't even belong to her. Stop treating her like a nanny. She is your partner. 

Your sister's burdens are not your responsibility nor your wife's. If your sister wants help, then go help her at HER place. Stop stressing out your wife. You agreed to the bail, you agreed to let your wife stay at home, and you let her take over finances. Stop bringing up the past to make your wife seem spoiled when you allowed it to happen. If she doesn't agree then find alternative ways that doesn't involve your wife. It's not rocket science.

"This is disturbing. It's one thing to troll people online or pick fights online. Not a nice thing to do, but fairly common. But to impersonate your spouse and say offensive things via your spouse's account? Not something a healthy, decent person does.

It seems like OP has enough evidence to know what happened. But probably not enough to force a confession from husband. She could just confront him and say ""I know it was you"" and demand an explanation. But a guy who would do this in the first place would probably stick to denying it up to, and probably even past being presented with undeniable evidence. 

He did do it though. Creepy as fuck. "

"I was going to say this as well. What was a bit off in the original post was the following:

&gt; He continued to say the N word, which angered me and caused me to strike him.

This is a wrong mentality. The kid did not cause you to strike him; **you** caused that. You are responsible for your own actions. When someone intends to anger you, you cannot hold them responsible for your reaction.

This is a lesson everyone has to learn the hard way: when someone wrongs you, losing your temper will always lead to everyone blaming you for it. There will never be a situation in which it's fine to hit someone, no matter what they did."
"&gt;I'm scared to broach the subject with him because he reacts so poorly to feedback.

You're scared to talk to your husband. He won't accept feedback. He doesn't believe in apologies. *You're scared to talk to your husband.* He made an unfortunate accident 100 times worse. He was treating you poorly even BEFORE the accident happened. YOU'RE SCARED TO TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND. 

That's not even remotely okay, OP. No ""redeeming qualities"" balance that out. It's simply not possible to be in a healthy partnership with someone who refuses to accept feedback and right wrongs. Those are the keys to growing and improving as a human being. Your husband wants to stagnate and you're enabling that by going along with it. 

Your child is going to grow up thinking it's normal to live a life walking on eggshells and holding her tongue to avoid setting violent people off. Something needs to change. I wish you well and hope you get some help.

"I'd like to add to your story; my father didn't know he had a daughter until one day we were sitting down for dinner and she just showed up at our door. My father went white, and nearly fainted.

He had a hard time coping with the idea he wasn't able to be there for his daughter, even though there was no  way he could have known.

Ultimately,  I think it hurt both of them profoundly.. because how do you make up for that and how do you square your feelings for your family with a totally unknown factor?

In the end, when he died we all lost contact with her because she wasn't part of our family. Which must hurt for her just as much now as when she found out that she had a father.

It's best to know.   "
"Well yeah, not because they’re gifts from my ex. They have value to me because I enjoyed wearing them, if I didn’t then I wouldn’t fuss over them as much. Aren’t I allowed to enjoy something that was gifted to me even if I’m no longer in contact with the person who gifted them to me. 




I acknowledge they were an issue which is why I stopped wearing them when she was around. But that should be as far as it went. I should not have to give up clothing I love because she doesn’t like it. 




I bought more clothes like the ones I lost here and there but that doesn’t mean that I need to get rid of old ones. Yes, they are just clothes but for the last time they are clothes I really like. Whether or not my ex gave them to me doesn’t matter, if I’d randomly purchased them while drunk I would still love them simply because they happen to be clothes that I enjoy wearing. 




You’re putting blame on me when someone went into my home and threw multiple pieces of clothing into the damn garbage. I don’t need a reason to keep my clothing beyond ‘I enjoy wearing it’. As far as addressing it goes, my deciding to not wear them, have them laying round when she was over should be enough. Do you police what your SO wears? If they happened to have clothing that was a gift from an ex that they enjoyed do you tell them you don’t like it and continue to get mad if you so much as see it out of the corner of your eyes?

"""I want to reply to her that what I did was none of her business and if she ever talks about my family like that again we won't be speaking anymore, and that I'll expect an apology from her.""

You already have the only correct response."
"I think your heart is in the right place, but that you're terribly misguided. 

You're asking a LOT from your wife and kids and you don't seem to acknowledge that at all. Introducing a new baby to the home, especially when your wife isn't 1000% on board, is going to cause a lot of upheaval for your children - and your wife. And you. 

I lived through something like this when I was 13 or 14. Long story short. Sister had nephew. Realized she didn't like having a kid. Had post partum. Simply refused to take care of so someone else in the house HAD to intervene. Eventually started staying out till wee hours of the morning. Nephew was raised by my parents with me as a nanny. There was irreparable damage done to relationships on all sides. Mom and dad, parents and sister, sister and myself. And it's been 20+ years at this point.  

The truth is, you have no idea what is going to happen to your sister after the baby comes. She is already emotionally traumatized. You think she's going to stay with you a couple weeks and then feel confident...more likely she'll have a few weeks to few entirely overwhelmed by the reality of the situation. In a home where she knows she's not welcome by at least one half the house. 
And to be fair, even if you take time off, she's not going to come to you talk about hemmoroids, or nursing, her breast pain, or bleeding concerns, or really anything to do with being a mother to a newborn. She's going to look to your wife. And that's a hell of a thing to sign your wife up for. 

Let's talk worst case. Sister has post partum and doesn't take to being a mom...now what? Who's taking that on? Sister refuses to get up and care for baby or freaks out and can't...who's doing it? For how long? What is she just up and leaves? Or starts not coming home right away? 

Posting bail for someone is incredibly impersonal compared to moving someone with a new baby in. You have spent money on your sister, you have supported her, you've agreed to go to the hospital with her....that's more than enough. 

Your PTO and emotional resources should be for your wife and kids. They should come FIRST. You should be concerned with providing them with a stable, healthy home - FIRST. It's pretty shitty to say your wife is spoiled. You've got three kids and a wife who as forgone a career of her own to raise those kids for you. Saving you untold sums of money on childcare and risking her own future financial well being by not establishing her own ability to support herself and the kids if need be. And SHE'S spoiled....You're supposed to be a team. Who's team are you on here? Seriously.  "
"You didn't do anything wrong but you should be totally up front with him. This is something you will not be able to hide from him.

It is up to him to continue dating you. He might be cool with it but he also might feel awkward knowing that 6 of his brothers all had sex with you. It would help if you got tested as well, group sex is obviously risky as far as STIs go.

Don't feel bad for having a good time though."

"Holy shit, if he really doesn't want kids, he needed a vasectomy *years ago.* Abortion as birth control is ridiculous and your poor body is taking the physical consequences. What you describe is not love, it's co dependency and cost sunk fallacy. Go to therapy and/or start an exit plan.     "
"OP, you did the right thing. Condoms are a great way to protect yourself from STDs and other nasty things that you can get from sex. It is definitely reasonable to need protection when having sex with someone you barely know. Chris is being unreasonable and was trying to push your boundaries. Good on you for not giving in. "
"I don't know if she's your best friend, but she's certainly not the brightest bulb if she's dating someone she knows to be a nutjob.

If you have his real name, I'd start looking to build a paper trail so that if this situation escalates, you have some solid proof you can use against him."
"You're quite right. 

I think she has a very difficult time empathizing. It's pretty rare that she'll ask me how I've been feeling. I don't expect it all the time (in fact that would be really annoying) but you know, even being asked how I feel/how the new thing I'm trying is working etc. once in a while could do a lot of good. When she has even a small health issue, I'm on top of it right away.

"That poor wife...the family got used to pushing her around, and now they're pissed that they can't do the same with OP. Clearly Jerry wasn't happy with the relationship with his first wife if they divorced, so it's ridiculous that he keeps saying, ""Well, [first wife] did this and that and let mum be in the room..."" Like, who the fuck cares? If it were me, my patience would have run out a long time ago, and he'd find himself divorced twice. I can't stand people who try to let their partners get run over by family, and then wanna be upset when their partner is firm and stands up for themselves."
I'd just stop debating it with her.  Tell her that you don't feel like the discussion will achieve much.
"I am SO sorry that you have been so much trauma.

You've done a really good job staying on top of your physical health with self-discipline and professional practitioners. 

What I don't see is you staying on top of your *mental health* in the same way. You clearly suffered some PTSD and PPD with the birth of your child, as many women do. But you haven't sought professional help to recover from those things. 

It is awful and so hard that you prolapsed, but it sounds like you're having a really hard time accepting what the doctors are telling you. And of course you are, because you've already been through so much and one more thing seems impossible to absorb. But that's where therapy can start to help. 

You need to process your grief around this trauma and find your way through to the other side. Go find the people that can help you do this. &lt;3

PS - Hysterectomies are usually only recommended in cases of *severe* prolapse, so while you can try PT and injections first, you need to prepare yourself that they may not work. Best of luck."
"Whew... it must *suck* when people start babying you. Hopefully if you communicate what you need from your partner involving your PTSD, he'll respect your boundaries and treat you the same as always! for example, explaining 

- what your general triggers are

- what you would expect for him to do (keep an eye out for triggers at potential events/movies/dates etc.)

- the fact that you don't need him to constantly check in with you about whether or not you're okay, as it only makes things worse

- that you're in control and if you need his help, you will reach out to him for it 

- etc. etc.

Or whatever is better suited to your needs and desires! I'm glad my comment helped, and I hope your boyfriend is communicative and trusting of you in the way that you deserve. :) &lt;3 You got this!!"

Being drunk is far from an excuse to justify your actions, or lack thereof. It comes down to character."
Everyone is agreeing with this but I'm confused. Where did OP say she expected the in-laws to never forgive him? She said the opposite in the title in fact.

Do you know who is great at listening to your issues? Therapists, I highly suggest therapy. Worst case you are out a little cash best case you feel better about your life and your marriage.

"&gt;I kept on hoping that if I kept dating I would find a guy who had similar values and goals as me. But it wasn't working so I gave Asian guys a shot. 

This is why you should be worried. You literally admit you never gave asian guys a shot until you ran through every white guy who would give you enough attention. That might as well be admitting to him that you're settling, and if you had your way you would never have dated him because one of those guys who dumped you would have stuck around.

I also find it hilariously dense that you kept looking for people who shared your values, but never considered that the guys who shared your race might also shared your values. That's not what you did. You went looking for a *white guy* who shared your values, and you found out that they were perfectly willing to use you for sex and perfectly unwilling to commit. That's what your BF knew inherently, because he lived it his entire adult life. He's seen the women that are like him look only for white guys.

Look, all this stems from the fact that women are pursued and men are the pursuers. You had your choice of men who expressed interest in you, and literally every time up until now you chose the white guy. He, on the other hand, had interest in many women, I'm sure, but if he's only ever had two reciprocate, then he's probably seen women like you choose white guys over him his whole life.

Yeah, you're right to be anxious. I can't guarantee how your BF will react, but the possibility is very real that he would end the relationship over this."

Your friend is too emotionally invested in your life and maybe even controlling. So what you go on a date and it doesn't click. SHE took a chance on her reputation when she set you up with HER coworker, which let's be honest you didn't want to in the first place.  Now she is disappointed and embarrassed and reacting it off on you by blaming you, and she believes her coworker over you. She's not being a good friend.  

You should tell her what happened, and you should tell her that she needs to learn to respect your boundaries and to stop pushing her expectations on you. She shouldn't blame herself for what happened with him (I mean, he seemed like a great guy) but she should be embarrassed for being so annoyed at you for not getting along with this guy. 

About this guy and assault: The fact that his reaction is to initially blame you instead of apologizing, and then to sulk about it for days leads me to think that he doesn't understand consent. If he had apologized at any point, I would've thought there was some miscommunication which can happen. The fact that he seems to feel entitled to cross your boundaries, and is now acting like you weren't ""nice"" to him, makes him look like a creep. "
"Tell her the facts, it's not rude to explain party etiquette to someone.  This isn't just about weddings, it's about any party invite.  You can't just invite a third party without checking with the host first. Weddings are a more restricted version of this, where the host indicates up front clearly who is invited.  Usually, relationships less than 6 months to a year don't need to get the plus one.

Your older sister's under no obligation to invite the shocker of a BF. 


Why are you all dancing around your younger sister's feelings like this?"
"ugh, this reminds me of a friend whose ex used to tickle her until she passed out from not being able to draw breath. then he'd tell the story at parties about how ""oversensitive"" to tickling she was, hahah, wasn't that funny?
"
"Or just asking to take a picture of him, for him. I dont know if its the case with hubs in this scenario, but I have plenty of selfies from events simply because Im always the person who takes photos of everyone, and I can't tell you how many times Ive come home and look through photos and it doesnt even look like I was there or even attended. Its depressing. They'll take photos of the cake, or the venue, or whatever, but not the person they spent the whole day with.

Asking for someone to take a photo of you feels sometimes even more awkward than just snapping a selfie, which is just a quick ""here I am!"" shot. "
"Wow. I don't know if I could forgive them, frankly.

But first things first. Figure out a way to say goodbye to your mother. Has the funeral happened yet? If so, hold another memorial of your own and give yourself some time to process her loss.

Beyond that, I would strongly recommend speaking to a therapist. Grief combined with betrayal on this level is going to be difficult to get through alone and you can't lean on your family for emotional comfort right now. You need somebody in your corner who can help you through all of this and the best choice would be a professional.

I'm so sorry."
"You are being incredibly irresponsible and seemingly are determined to blow up your life (and the lives of your family) without a concrete reason to do so.

Get a real paternity test. Before you do anything else. Then go from there. "
"&gt; He can't choose his sexuality, but he could choose not to pressure his wife into having kids, and he could choose not to cheat on her, either.

Exactly. The actions and choices are what is lousy here. You're under no obligation to forgive him, though you aren't really owed an apology either since the relationship is not yours, per se."
"While I understand your reasoning, I think it's very, very important to live with someone before you marry them. It's different than spending a lot of time together. 

That being said, wanting to wait until you're engaged is a much more reasonable idea - that way you have the commitment, but can end things if you are totally incompatible. "
"He gets it, he just doesn't care enough to stop doing it to you yet."
"You're correct. The airing of the recording was a step too far. And now it's been dealt with and people will have forgotten about it by next week and you need to do the same. If you see the person who played the prank around the office treat them as you would normally - polite nod and ""hello"" etc etc. Don't let it turn into some simmering battle between you."
"No, you're not crazy.

The company someone keeps says a lot about them. Your boyfriend wants to be best friends with an alcoholic who has zero boundaries, disrespects his relationship with his girlfriend, spends Christmas away from her husband and with your boyfriend's family, and is a mooch. 

If I were you, I would sit him down (or even write him a letter), explaining why this bothers you. If he makes excuses or belittles your feelings (and remember, this woman invaded YOUR bed...WTF), or agrees with you and does not follow through with creating and sticking to boundaries with her, you will know she is a larger priority to him than you are and you should move on. There's no way you should put up with that. "
"&gt; didn't ask if I was okay, and then made it all about him when we got back to my place after.

And this? If he had a panic response, okay, that's something they can work through, but when the heat of the moment passed he still didn't take responsibility for leaving her in a potentially dangerous situation. Even if he feels embarrassed, deflecting blame to avoid talking about it is a selfish and immature response.

What evidence has he given that he'll ""try better the next time"" when he hasn't even acknowledged that his response was inappropriate this time?"
Sounds like that's exactly what she did with husband's first wife :(
"Thank you for this. OP offended me (an older mom) with the line about how they chose careers and money instead of having children at a more reasonable age. Also, a 10 year old is not a teenager.

That aside, definitely refuse to watch this child again! He sounds like a danger to himself and others for sure. I am curious--he must act like this when he is with his parents at times, right? Just wondering how they can blame it on the caregiver..."
"I only read the headline. The answer is no. You are not unreasonable. If ypu have bugs of any sort, you aren't coming to my house. Period. And I'm not going to yours.
"
"Matters of the heart are rarely logical and straightforward.  We (most of us, anyway) have all made similar mistakes as OP.  "
Except that his dad was right. Your husband's porn use IS ruining your marriage. 
"Eh, I think a stumbling drunk person holding your baby is pretty serious and deserves a good berating."
"What does your therapist say?

&gt;  I have sexual urges that are unavoidable and natural and I'm trying to figure out what to do about that.

What do you think SHE did for 6 months?  Fuck yourself bro..... take that either way ;)"
"This. OP, please let the GF know that she has support no matter how she proceeds (breaking up, pressing charges, etc). Social pressure is a big factor in keeping women in abusive relationships; we worry that our friends will turn on us if we get a ""nice guy"" in trouble."
"Are you always asking the same questions for the same type of situation? 

Or is it different questions and different topics?


Logistics companies are very detail and process oriented, there is usually a process and physical tick list for the kind of activity you describe. If there isn't, make one."
"There's really something to be said about tethering your life to someone who thinks there is only one way to do things-- his way-- and he pushes that way on other people whether they're willing or not.

That's all I'll say. Think long and hard about whether this is a recurring thing in your relationship."

"I think it's more the point that YOU cheated, so there's really nothing to say that HE didn't also 'cheat'. For some it might be personal assumptions around anal/gay sex, but it's also a trust issue.

What if HE was sleeping around on you and gave you something? That's essentially how you're treating your wife if you don't tell her and have sex with her.

EDIT - just to add that there is there is this idea that cheaters don't love their partners who they cheat on - you mention a lot about your prison side partner but almost nothing of your wife. That's what I read from the DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH HER bit."
Best answer! This is why Reddit can be so awesome.
"&gt;We have talked about cleanliness in the past, but the conversation always devolves to the basic facts I laid out: ...

It's not a fruitful conversation to just air complaints if you want something done. The discussion has to involve actionable plans, and the onus is largely on you to come up with them, because it's you who wants to change a status quo they find acceptable. However, this may not be easy for you to push through, because...

&gt;I am not on the lease, and don't pay rent but neither does anyone else. Long story short, the company they all work for pays for living expenses because they're long-term international consultants. 

Even if they're not paying for it, this is *their* apartment. They get it through their jobs - each one would still be there if any of the others left, while you wouldn't even be able to get in the door if you weren't with your boyfriend. You're not a spouse, so you may not even technically be allowed. What I'm saying by this is that you are basically allowed/tolerated, rather than entitled to the apartment, so I don't think you should expect accommodation to your level of cleanliness. I actually would have personally found the replacement of trash bins in my apartment to be a rather rude thing for an SO to do without discussing it with me first.

Regardless, is this really such a big event that you can't apologize first, for the sake of keeping the peace while guests are around? If problems continue to recur, it can be revisited after guests leave."
"&gt;  I would have said the same thing if it was a guy. 

Oh really??  I don't want to sound sceptical, but I struggle to believe this.


Does he understand that it has hurt and offended you, and has he agreed not to do it again??"
"This is crazy. I was checking to see if you're my own half sister, because I worked at the movie theatre in town and met my half sister there for the first time a few months ago when we happened to see each other. She's in her mid twenties and I'm 19. So... I can relate! The awkwardness... yeah, it's pretty uncomfortable. 
If you don't want to reach out further then absolutely don't. If you aren't under any stress and genuinely want to meet her, then just wait for her to accept your friend request and shoot her a message. I would just be wary that she is a little younger and may not be comfortable, so I wouldn't try anything unless she accepts. 
If you're close with your mom, I would definitely bring this up. She might have some good advice and knows your family better than any of us. All you can do beyond that is wait for your half-sis to reciprocate. 
Edit: Also, do you think you two communicating will get you roped into communicating also with your dad's side of the family? "
"Your feelings, priorities etc are being stepped on by your sister. She has already shown she is immature and does not care about you. And I think you should tell her that her inaction makes you feel she does not care at all about you. Hopefully that will get her into action. 

Regardless, it is time for clear and set limits. Tell her now that on September 30th you are changing the locks, and prepared to call the police. She has enjoyed your hospitality long enough.

Yes, it will likely cause some anger, it might sour the relationship. But if you do not take this step, it will also sour the relationship and perhaps harm the relationship with your SO. Stand up for yourself.

edit : since you did not give enough information about the issues with sex, whether they are yours or hers, I could not really respond to that. But if her foreseeable future involves roommates, she is gonna have to learn there are times to make yourself scarce."
"My ground rules would be, ""You can have sex with anyone, as many people as you like, as many times as you like, and you don't have to tell me anything bc you are single now.""

Your bf is greatly overestimating ""youthful spontaneity."" He is greatly underestimating the improvement to sex that happens over time with two people who know each other well and are committed to making each other happy. 

I don't think your ex-boyfriend has what it takes to make an open relationship successful. It sounds like what he wants out of a relationship is primarily orgasms, and that's all well and good, but you don't have to feel bland just because he wants to spread his wild oats."
tbh I find the butthole part oddly pleasing? The worst part is the top/above the vagina if you go fully bare. You can do a landing strip to avoid that though 
"&gt; He's admitted to me that he feels slightly less attracted to me than when we met and on some days he notices the fat around my thighs to be heavier. Recently I tried to put on some shorts I had in college and hadn't worn in a couple years and they didn't fit. He told me that really upset him and he was worried if he didn't say anything now that it would just get worse.

Holy red flags Batman, this is not normal behavior. This is controlling. Think about it this way - can you *ever* in any universe imagine berating your boyfriend for gaining 2-3 pounds, or telling him that you've noticed he is gaining some flab in his stomach and that it ""really upsets"" you? No? That's because it's an asshole thing to do and you don't seem to be an asshole. 

You're not being sensitive at all, he's treating you like a possession of his that needs to be fixed. That's fucked up dude. Of course he should like you as you are now, there's nothing wrong with you but the fact that you're in a fucked up relationship and don't realize it. "
"&gt;  He told me that his friends/family thought his behavior was just fine

Just because he said it, it doesn't mean it's true.  I highly doubt he'd admit it if his mother thought he was being a manipulative asshole.


"
"&gt; I feel like I'm under surveilence, 

Because you are. 

He's controlling and manipulative and you are heading into another abusive relationship.

Also, you need to check your computer/phone for keyloggers and stuff like that. He's a nutjob, but they can be pretty tech savvy."
"He's described himself as being ""vain"" before so yeah, I think he might be into women who have the high-maintenance look, at least on some level.

I wouldn't say he's forcing the fetish on me necessarily, he doesn't actively complain when I'm wearing less makeup, but the amount of positive reinforcement he gives when I DO wear a lot shows that it's his strong preference. I'm used to dating guys who like less/no makeup so it's sort of a weird contrast for me."
"This is a fucking weird flavor of sexual harassment to have to deal with. Even if you fix this, they've made it clear they're jackasses you're going to have to mommy into basic professionalism at best.

I'd start looking for a new job, if that's at all a possibility."
"She needs therapy to talk this out. You sound like you could use someone to speak to yourself.

You also need to move house. Like yesterday.
The area isn't safe and she's really never going to feel safe in her home again. "
"First of all, you need to go to counseling with your wife to see if it's possible to work through the bond issue. Decisions should be made as a couple, not held as an ""I did this for you, so now you need to do this for me"" chip. You're obviously still pissed off about it, &amp; it's not going away for you, so you need help in dealing with it. And if you feel like your wife generally makes all the joint decisions for you, then that's all the more reason to go. 

As for your sister, we all understand that you want to do this. You can stop arguing back against everyone that says they don't think it's the best idea. But the thing is, your sister is unexpectedly pregnant but not an incompetent adult. You want to swoop in &amp; be a hero &amp; save her in the way you find suitable. But lots of us here think that taking time off work &amp; staying with her in her own home will be more helpful. Otherwise, it's going to be just as rough of a landing to drop her back home, where she has no established routine since she's just spent 3 weeks in your house, completely by herself with no car &amp; a baby. It would be great if you could deal with sleeping on a sofa for a few weeks so you could help her establish her mommy routine in her own home, with her own resources, so there's no second transition when she would need to move out of your place. And you need to be open to the ""worst case scenario"" stuff you're dismissing right now. What happens if she has a difficult birth (say a C-section that limits her mobility) or the baby needs to stay in the hospital for a while or she experiences post-partum depression &amp; can't be left alone with the baby? If she doesn't have anyone else &amp; won't accept your mother's help, then you really need to consider these things. "
Your gf seems immature
"When I was very young (5 or 6) my mums best friend had a miscarriage. My parents told me (and I can still remember this perfectly) that when a mummy is growing a baby inside her, there are hundreds and hundreds of switches that the baby has to have turned on to grow and be healthy. If even 1 or 2 switches don't come on, the baby won't be born. It's very sad and we should all be very nice to auntie Cathy etc"" 

The main thing I took away from this was that 1) it was no ones fault and 2) growing babies is a very complicated thing that sometimes goes wrong and it's okay to be sad. "
"Your boyfriend needs parenting classes. His current method of parenting isn't working. 

Randall likely needs therapy to deal with his obvious anger issues. 

As for the relationship with Dean? Your kid depends on you to keep him safe. "
"Right? I love buffalo chicken, spicy burritos, and jalapeño margaritas. But there's a huuuuuge difference between that and

&gt; the spiciest dishes of all time

The food she ate has made her sick for 2 days. That's serious gastrointestinal distress we're talking about.

OP, I'm glad you're excited to be engaged but I think this might be on you."
"Of course it's not toxic to *her*, it's toxic to the freaking son! He's only 11 years old! "
"&gt; If they expected you to wait until marriage, they should have preached that particular thing to you and made it clear what their expectations were (no sex in the house, wait until you're 18, or whatever). 

Fucking this. I mean, even when most people in this sub probably disagree with 'waiting till marriage' or not allowing your kids to have sex, not punishing your kids for something you never established as a rule is parenting 101. "
Please take that to heart. 
"If you remain friends with her, it will just keep hurting. Time to move on."
"I will say this OP, I probably would have broken up with you too. Relationships should be partnerships where if one partner has a problem they approach the other one like an equal and use communication to find a solution.

You unilaterally decided that the puppy was going to be given to a shelter or given away without trying to communicate first and come up with other solutions. You didn't treat her like a partner; you treated her like you were her parent or her boss. You have every right to express that you are struggling with having the puppy in your living space and hell you even have the right to decide that you want to give away the puppy.

But, just because it's your right doesn't mean it's the right thing to do in a relationship."
"If I were Jim, I would probably politely decline.  I do think it's odd they didn't invite his long term girlfriend that he lives with.  I think the only time it's acceptable not to invite a SO is when the wedding is super duper small and intimate; however, if that were the case, Jim probably would not have been invited anyway since you said they aren't as close anymore.  Also, Ben probably would have said that when asked earlier."
"""I'm sorry, I won't be driving to the party, so I won't be able to offer anyone a lift"".

Never volunteer someone else for a task.  If she asks you to ask your ride, just say ""No."" 

""No"" is a perfectly valid, complete sentence.

Don't try to come up with excuses.  Don't try to justify or defend your ""no"".  just say ""No."""
"You were raped and worse, your friends who should've had your back set you up to be raped. 

I would tell them to fuck off and setting you up like that is super shitty. I wouldn't reveal you have an STI because they sound like the kind of people who would do bad things with that info."
"""You need to take a pregnancy test and we do need to start talking options if you are indeed pregnant. Waiting and not knowing is completely stressing me out and I imagine it is for you as well.  I'll stay with you via skype, on the phone, wait via text, etc. But I need you to do this.""  Then make sure she actually does, see results, if she is make sure the doctor gives a clear window for conception and that your time together falls in it, etc.

If she is pregnant.  ""Obviously I care about you and want to support whatever you feel is right for you, but we don't live in the same area and have only been dating a month.  No matter what you decide it is going to be challenging for both of us to navigate it. I think we need to slow down on the relationship piece and focus on our options for handling this. What are you thinking?""

If she wants an abortion.  ""Regardless of what happens with us, I'll find a way to make this as easy on you as possible.  What do you need from me?""

Then have the transparent conversation post-abortion, she is under enough stress.

If she wants to keep the pregnancy and have the child. ""I have to be honest, I don't see this relationship working out. We've only known each other a short time and we don't live in the same area.  A pregnancy is only going to add stress. I'll obviously pay child support and figure out how to coparent with you at the level that makes sense for us, but I think we need to break-up now rather than prolong this into something that is unfair for all involved.  From here on out it needs to be about what is best for the child.""

Don't pretend even for a little while because you don't want her keeping the child on the idea that the two of you might be together. But definitely get a lawyer, paternity test, etc. 

If she wants to consider adoption.  ""I agree that we aren't ready to parent. I'm also thinking about how hard it is going to be to continue the relationship while you are pregnant given the distance, how long we've been dating, and the other life stressors we both have. I think it'll be healthier for both of us and this pregnancy for us to stop dating and try to stay friends instead (if you want to stay friends of course).  I care so much about you, but I don't see this working long term.""

You need to see the potential pregnancy through.  If the likelihood of her being pregnant is low hopefully you're fine and it is just a scare. Take this as a lesson to always use birth control and condoms and to discuss what would happen should an unintended pregnancy occur and make sure that you are on the same page whenever possible with a partner before you get to this point."
He doesn't get to decide that. The person being manhandled gets to decide how they feel about it. Intentions don't mean a thing. 
"&gt; I just feel guilt for drinking away so many years and missing out on so much of my kids lives.

You can't change the past, but you can change the future.

Hell, what are you doing today?  If you're doing chores around the house, why not blow them off and do something extra fun with the kids?

Doesn't even have to cost money...  check out a public park, find a frisbee-golf course, go to the library or beach, etc.

Therapy will help, of course, but a spontaneous outing is something you can do RIGHT NOW with almost no preparation or long-term commitment.

Have a good day!"
You absolutely tell her mother that her HUSBAND is cheating on her with her DAUGHTER.
"&gt;he's able to adult.

He's able to adult but mommy moved in why would he want to?

I get that everyone has preferences. He grew up that way and so while *he goddamn knows well by now how to peel and de-seed his own fruit*, he knows he can get OP to do it by playing this stupid game that ""Wah I don't know how to peel my own fruit and ew seeds.""

If I were op I'd stop doing everything for him. She's his gf not his mom, and, really unless he has an Oedipus complex, he's too old to be behaving like a toddler. "
"So I've lost 110lbs over the last few years by changing my diet and eating healthier. That being said, if my husband got me a huge cake for my bday I would think that was awesome and sweet and thank him. The fact that your first reaction is to ask if it's Paleo is worrying. Sounds like this has been an issue for a while and your husband just wanted to do something fun/nice for you. His reaction was awful but you don't sound like you're very receptive to his efforts. I would recommend counseling if you want to save the marriage but honestly it doesn't really sound like you want to."
"I get that you're upset, but you're coming across as really self-involved.  You never think about how you behavior might have effected her.

This girl wanted to wait until marriage, she found a guy she really liked, but he dumped her after five months because of no sex.  Then she slept with her best friend and gave up her vision of only sleeping with one man for her whole life."
"This comment cannot be high enough.

I have never understood why we do things to children that we would consider abusive among adults - anything from tickling or hugging when the kid doesn't want to, to shouting at them or hitting them. This, too, is abusive, and *not ok*."
"You need to tell your husband, and work with him to move forward. If he finds out from someone else first this will make you look untrustworthy to him again.
 

As for the other man, do nothing. Ignore your AP completely. Do not speak to him. Do not waste time wondering why he moved to your area. Act like he doesn't exist.

Don't give this guy any attention or any space in your head. If you see him, ignore him. If he approaches you, tell him to leave you alone and walk away. You don't owe him friendship or basic politeness out in the world. You do not have to engage with him just because he is around."
"So... Like someone else asked, why didn't you 'follow up' when you didn't hear from him for three days? 

Personally you're sounding a bit like you were taken aback by his response, your pride got hurt, and now you're trying to blame him for this."
It's getting pretty scary these days with kids being suspended or expelled for things that occur outside of school hours and off of school grounds.  
"In reading your comments, it sounds like the crux of the issue is that you miss having an intellectual connection with your wife.  It potentially also sounds like you miss seeing her be passionate about something.  If either of these things are true, I'd tell her that.

"OP really buried the lede here. Honestly, the sleeping is the least of his problems."
"Liking a band = enjoying the art they are creating. 
Putting up pictures of a half naked anime girl = enjoying the sexyness of said cartoon character.

How can you possibly compare enjoying an art form with drooling over a half naked girl? An appropriate comparison would be filling your apartment with posters of a half naked band member. Alternatively, the equivalent of getting a signed guitar would be getting a signed copy of the cartoon by the artist that made it. 

Edit because of spelling."
"There is literally no reason you husband cannot go alone.

His insistance to the contrary would hugely, and negatively, impact my opinion of him.

This would be a dealbreaker for me."
"This man is obviously a garbage human being and I don't blame you one bit for not wanting to be near him. I'm guessing your husband and the entire family has a super warped idea of normalcy considering this man wasn't drop kicked out of all of their lives. I'm very close to someone who dealt with an abuse situation like this and that's what happened--none of them ever talked to the monster again, and it's hard for me to fathom wanting to interact with someone who was ever a child predator.

I second the motion that if he won't go without you that's his choice. He needs to respect the fact that you don't want to be around this man, and I feel a lot of people, sex abuse victims or not, would feel the same way and be completely justified in that"

"Okay, but your SO will necessarily be the core of your support network. So if he's hardly enough for you, how do you expect to sustain a family?

Sorry to be blunt. But seriously, from your post he doesn't support your recovery as you see it going. You need to get on the same page about your recovery and what you both want/ are capable of.

I hope you find satisfaction."
"I think you both could handle it a bit better. You were hella rude. Just going to your room is (rightfully) interpreted as a super passive aggressive sign that you're annoyed with them.

I'd say a week is overkill,but considering it still hasnt sunk in for you,maybe you needed the wake up

&gt; I told her that I didn't see how it was rude.

Unless you have no social skills, this is pretty hard to believe.

Part of having inlaws and visiting is playing host. Suck it up champ. I'm not saying you have to spend every weekend with them, but doing it without saying a word is probably the worst possible way you could handle it. You can't just wander off without a word"
"4a. She tells me to stop, but what does she know about what she wants? I know better.

Not a love language problem. More like a complete lack of respect problem."
This is pretty relevant info! For some women getting ready for Round 2 is difficult. You should edit your main post with this.
"I can definitely understand why this would hurt his feelings, but I also know, for me, I wouldn't want the symbol of our commitment to each other to be something that my partner had negative feelings about every time they looked at it.

 I think bringing up the idea of taking the stone from that ring and having it re-set into a different band is a good way to do it- it still keeps it as the stone that he proposed to you with. For me, in his shoes, I'd prefer something like that over the advice that you're getting to just stop wearing it when you have your wedding band."
"It's important to remember that this JUST happened. She was assaulted. She'll never totally get over that but the feelings she has now will fade.  

I had a cousin that pulled a knife on his brother-in-law. He was super drunk, and my cousin-in-law said he would never be around him again.  

My knife-pulling cousin just got married, and my cousin-in-law didn't come, but they sit at holidays together and are around each other more than twice a year. A year from now, maybe she'll not want to be around her b-i-l but she'll feel a lot more calm about everything than she does right now. "
"My friend is part of the family, he treats my little sister as his own. He takes her to plays and reads her foreign literature, she likes language and he is fluent in many. I will speak to him tonight, I do not know how to ask him of the situation however."

If you'd rather trick yourself into thinking this 25 year old woman sleeping with high school students is somehow morally above fucking other students, some who are probably in a lot worse shape emotionally than your brother and his gf, then feel free to do so. Just don't expect the rest of us to agree with your decision. 

It really comes down to cowardice vs doing the right thing. You'll pick what works for you."
"Seconded.

Was once Maya. 

So glad my dad got sole custody and kept it."
"You could remind him that he's only her *brother*, not her father. I have a brother who's 9 years older than me and he does not buy me things. Granted, your boyfriend is in a wholly unique situation of having a new sibling, BUT it's been over a year? And he still acts like that? I don't know... Maybe time to start acting like siblings, and none of the things you described are terribly normal for siblings. "
Totally agree. Do not pay. You need to set boundaries early on in marriage. Or they'll keep pushing. I guarantee it. 
"Send a picture of your sonogram that reads ""Thanks for the parting gift, asshole.""

No, I'm kidding. But, yeah you should tell him. Sit down and consider all the possible outcomes (ie. he doesn't want to be involved, he wants some involvement, he wants all the involvement) and plan accordingly. You don't want to be caught off guard by any potential response of his, and you should have a clear idea going into the conversation of what your desired outcome is, and what you're willing to compromise. If you are concerned about potential custody issues, consult a lawyer. 

Once you're prepared, you can start the conversation in a way that makes the most sense to you. Good luck!"

"Problem is, in the 21st century, women are still critiqued for being sexual and men aren't. 

Truth is, as a man, you don't deal with the low hum of sexism that still exists and that women have been dealing with for centuries.

Don't let what is supposed to be the best day of your life get ruined by people who just tear you down. I am willing to bet that on your big day you honestly won't even be thinking about them. "

"&gt;She then either physically lashes out towards me or threatens suicide.

So she is abusive, mentally and physically? You may be a stabilising presence in her life but she is a detrimental presence in yours. Staying with someone who abuses and disrespects you will take a huge toll on your psyche. Don't set yourself on fire to keep her warm. Keep in mind that you don't have to stay married to her in order to help her. You could keep in contact and see that she gets help if she needs it. But you should at the least try a trial separation.

If she threatens suicide again, call the police. That may be one way to get her help. "

"They sell these cute silicone wedding bands, great if you want something flexible and easy to clean and if you take it off a lot you don't need to stress about replacing it if it gets lost because they are low cost. 

You could also wear your ring as a necklace (perhaps your neck is less sensitive then your fingers?). I did this when I was pregnant because my hands swelled.

Also finger tattoos have notoriously short shelf life, they rub off over time and need to be touched up frequently. 

Keep investigating options and keep open communication with your husband. I'm sure there is a solution out there that you guys will both be happy with. Maybe try and compromise and wear the ring only when out in public.

"Mix it up a bit, teach him how to yell ""FUCK OFF""^I'm ^kidding"
"This is great advice, however I would go against deleting all the photos! Put them somewhere inaccessible, or at least out of obvious reach, but you may want them in the future when you've moved on and still have some happy memories with her.

Just because the relationship ended doesn't mean it was all awful or your memories aren't valuable/true. It just means she didn't want to stay with you forever. Don't let that invalidate the happy memories you had.

But for now, it's easier to make distance and try not to think of her, save the happy memories for when you've moved on."
+1. Why hasn't this happened already I don't know. It will put an end to the asking. Even just posting an anniversary picture on Facebook with 'X years with my beautiful wife' would do the trick.

Deal breaker."
"&gt; Well, to be fair, he isn't really treating her badly.

"What the everliving fuck.  Your BIL kicked the cane out from a disabled man and kicked him on the ground when he couldn't defend himself?  He needs to be in jail.  Your brother needs to call the police and you need to testify about what you saw.  There is no world in which BIL was justified in his actions.

Your other problem is your equivocating, enabling husband.  You would be more than reasonable to ask yourself ""if he's willing to forgive and defend his brother after he attacked my disabled family member without provocation, is there any situation where I can expect him to be my side when his brother causes problems?"". There isn't a middle ground here.  Your husband is showing where his loyalties really lie, and it's not with you or his daughter.  Let that sink in.

There is just so much dysfunction here.  Your brother needs to go to the police right away.

Edit:. You're being a shit mom, by the way.  When your daughter is in therapy years from now because she was exposed to constant family violence and tension as a young child, she's not going to be in there talking about the time she got nice presents at the birthday party where her uncle was viciously assaulted in front of her, or the time you went on some dumb vacation in order to pretend everything was okay in your broken home.  Jesus fuck, lady!"
"Hi OP,

The first thing you might want to consider is to stop using your boyfriend as an excuse.

&gt;I keep saying ""Matthew probably wouldn't be comfortable with me hanging out with a guy one on one."" and ""My boyfriend wouldnt be too happy with me letting another guy rub my body so I think I'll pass."" 

This implies that if Matthew wasn't in the picture that his behavior would be okay, and it's not.  Use I statements, and let him know you are uncomfortable with his suggestions, period, and stick to your boundaries.  Block him on social media and keep your interactions work related.

You also need to stop accepting money from this guy.  I know it's probably hard to do at this point, but if I were you I would pay him back for the money he's given you thus far.  It isn't appropriate.  But moving forward, do not accept any more gifts.  He's not being nice, he's being a creep and is trying to make moves on you."
"&gt;""just a neg"".

The idiot who came up with the idea of negging belongs in a special circle of hell. It's literally a way to manipulate someone into thinking they're lesser so they put up with your bullshit. 

Saying ""it's just a neg"" is like saying ""it's a compliment"" when you're catcalled. No, it's not, and stop lying to yourself to make it sound better in your head. "
"You've surrounded yourself with some really shitty people, TBH."
"There's three issues here: 

1. He lied to you specifically about having kids and entertained the idea even AFTER you two were engagaed.

2. He is saying he doesn't want a child (unless it's his ""own"" which apparently is not possible)

3. If it was just about him not being able to not having his own biological kids, that's one thing- but he's not trying to close off discusssion to ANY children. And you didn't sign up for that.

Is he sure he is in fact infertile? I def. would be putting a hold on the wedding indefinitely until you come to a resolution."
"I'll be honest, OP - you aren't wrong, though neither is your wife, really, even though her reasons sort of suck. 

It has nothing to do with your sister being ""foolish"" or whatnot. She might be a free spirit, but sounds to me like she's entirely functional so it's not like she's a free-loader. She trusted someone and was naive. That's not malicious or inherently self-destructive.

But, man...3 children of her own as well as a newborn infant and a new mommy who will need support as well will be a lot for your wife. That's a lot for her to deal with while you're at work. Kinda have to respect that.

Are there any other options for helping your sister out on the table? I think your compassion towards her is commendable, but logistically maybe there's another way for this to work."
"I agree, the child could potentially benefit from a double citizenship and/or other things. He doesn't really have to behave like a father, but it could be nice to have a grandmother in Europe or something like that.
For the child, not for the father (which appears to be rather shitty).
But I highly recommend that OP informs herself on the laws about this (just to make an example, in some countries if the father doesn't want a child he can simply not appear on the birth certificate and that's it, in some other countries you can't put the father outside the children life, he has certain rights) and depending on the laws she can decide what does it really mean for the future to tell him."
"You realize that most parents have baby monitors in the bedrooms of their sleeping infants, right?"
"No, but that doesn't really have anything to do with your blind spots. You both have them, and they are introducing a *lot* of chaos into your marriage. 

Your wife's brother sucks. He also had no one else to turn to. Whether or not he deserves support is moot to your wife.

Your sister, even with your glossy description, clearly hasn't grown up. I'm gonna guess that your wife is about as enthusiastic about her being forever tied to a shady con artist by her pregnancy as you are about your wife's ties to a criminal drug addict. You both have cause to think the other's sibling is a goddamn idiot. And you unilaterally offering your house to your sister without your wife on board would show about as much contempt for your supposed partnership as your wife's bail-posting. 

You have no idea if your sister's loser ex will come knocking with some sob story trying to wheedle his way back into her life. I'm sure this thought hasn't escaped your wife. Let your mom handle your sister and deal with your shaky-ass marriage before inviting more stress into your life. It is *long* past time to address the balance of power and the communication fuckups in your marriage. "
"Absolutely. Especially since the boyfriend has already mentioned the same issue of being ""blindsided"". 

Op, the fact that your boyfriend told you he didn't like being surprised by finding out about friends you've slept with once, and it literally just blindsided him again, is probably the biggest reason He's upset"
"I don't blame her for that. Announce my engagement by calling me a fat walrus? Yeah, you're not getting an invite."
"exactly this. hes is gaslighting you saying that, its total BS"
"My boyfriend was a boob guy too, but instead of pointing out how small mine are (B) he tells me all the other things he loves about me, and says now he's an ass guy! (I have a big booty)

If my partner ever said anything negative to me about my body, followed by comparing me to his ex, I would be done with the relationship. SO's are supposed to boost your confidence and self esteem - not shatter it."
"Your fiancee should know better than to make jabs at your sister, BUT your sister is a disrespectful little b-word.  I don't think your fiancee is over the dog incident, I don't really blame her, sister's response to losing the dog was horrible.  Had she apologized then, I doubt the engagement incident would have happened.   
  
Again, as a 25 year old fiancee shouldn't have said anything about sister, but sister is further out of line IMO.  I hope you weren't expecting her to stand up in the wedding.   "

"Just start. 

Say good morning to her tomorrow, see where it goes. If she doesn't respond, that's fine. Say good morning again the next day. It is a very weird situation, but it's good that you want to change it. You can change it. Little by little. 

The other option is just to talk to her honestly about it and tell her everything you wrote, that you want a better relationship... etc. But it sounds like you might not be ready for that. It's up to you. 

You can't control what she does, but you can control yourself. You can say hi every time you see her, ask her how she is, and just start talking. Eventually the routine of being silent with one another will fade and it won't seem so odd to talk. Just start. "

"I'm an atheist (really a secular Jew) myself, but I also understand the importance that religion plays in a ton of peoples lives and I always respect that importance, even if I don't understand it. People like your friend are what gives atheists a bad rap in the first place. Honestly, she's being really disrespectful and this is a sign that she's not as good of a friend that you thought she was. She's free to not go and celebrate your marriage if it's really that against her morals/beliefs, but this is probably a sign that you need to distance yourself from this friend a bit."
"&gt;And I realize it would save him time, but it's not like this is an incredibly huge inconvenience


Yeah, actually, that *is* a pretty large inconvenience. And the fact that you don't acknowledge it comes across as super unappreciative.


If you refuse to find a way to see him that doesn't require him to do all the work and come to get you, I guess you don't get to see him. Not sure how long the relationship will last in that case, but it is what it is. 


This is your issue; it's on *you* to find a way to work around it and not place the entire burden of dealing with it on someone else."
"""Her and **others**""

Bullshit. He was caught and he's now trying to lie his way out of it. He couldn't be bothered to tell you he was meeting her until now? That means even if he was telling the truth about just trying to help her (he isn't) then he was **still** prioritising his secret meetings with her over your relationship and your feelings on the matter. Her &gt; you. 

You have literally no reason to believe him. He's going to pull out all the tricks to excuse and defend what he was doing and right now he's going to the standard ""I was just trying to be a good guy!"" defense. I'd be willing to bet he's going to tell you ""I didn't tell you because I knew you'd be upset"" next, which makes literally no fucking sense.

This would be a dealbreaker for me. He's a liar and he's almost certainly been having an affair, otherwise he would have told you. Call your attorney."
"Well, let's focus on the outcomes.  Does he actually listen during these discussions?  When you try to have a serious discussion, does he pay attention to what you're saying (even if there's a phone on) acknowledge and discuss the problem, and then work with you to come up with a solution, which he then implements in the future?

For Instance:

You: ""It really bugs me when you roll your eyes whenever my friend talks.""

Him: [Opening video.]  ""I can't help it, your friend thinks crystals have souls.""

You: ""If you don't like my friend we can arrange for you not to hang around her as much.  But when you are with her, you to need not be a jerk to her, because it makes the entire situation uncomfortable, and puts me into a position to have to choose between you.""

Him: [still looking at phone] ""Ok, that seems fair.""

[later]

Friend: ""And that's why I think the soul of my newest amethyst is a reincarnated Zulu warrior.""

Him [without eyerolling or sarcasm]: ""Interesting.  Welp, I'm going to go do something else now, you two have fun with your talk.""

If that there is what's going on, I'd say maybe that's just his way to process.  But if the situation is a little more like this.

You: ""can you please flush the toilet after you use it?""

Him: [Opening video.] ""huh.""

You: ""I really hate having a bathroom that smells like shit.""

Him: [watching video.] ""huh.""

[later]

You: ""You left another huge turd in the toilet!""

Him: [Opening video.] ""huh.""

Then the problem is just that he's using the videos to ignore you every time you want something that interferes with what he wants.  No shit it ""helps him cope,"" he's coping by not listening to you and ignoring your problems.

If it's the latter, dump him.  If it's the former, consider staying, but also consider that this may just be a dealbreaker for you even if it's not technically ""wrong.""  If what you need in a relationship is someone that spends more time actually focusing on you and talking to you instead of staring at the phone in your general vicinity, then that's what you need.

At the end of the day, being with him is making you cry.  Even if he's not actively trying to manipulate you into doing whatever he wants by stonewalling you every time you try and talk to him about something, this just might not be a good relationship for you to be in."
"&gt; Even though he may not want this, I do think that after a paternity test and the like that his family would be welcoming and would try with the child.

"Stop infantilizing your girlfriend. She is not a passive object, and she is the one with the responsibility not to cheat on you, not her best friend Peter. She has to be the one to establish boundaries with men who are interested in her, or else she'll just cheat again. 

It honestly sounds like you still haven't accepted that she cheated on you. You're still making excuses for her, trying to find a way to absolve her of what she did so that you can convince yourself that she's still the perfect girl you think she is. As a consequence you have all this misplaced anger towards Peter, who you're using as an unhealthy surrogate for your rage at her cheating. Furthermore, concerning Peter, distancing yourself from him is fine, but there will be other guys like Peter so it's important to realize that the problem starts with your girlfriend's infidelity and inability to establish clear relationship boundaries with men. Also don't get physical with him.

OP you deserve better. You keep saying you know he loves you but I haven't seen that evidenced **anywhere** in your story and that's even accounting for the fact that your venting and we're only hearing the bad right now. any other good things he does still wouldn't make up for that."

"You are not Superman or a Jedi. You are not the gallant hero who is saving the world from an evil 'succubus'. 

Stop trying to frame this as an epic battle or war. It only makes you seem like an unreliable narrator. You hate her. We get it.

Some people will choose to keep this woman in their lives no matter how toxic or dramatic she is. Nothing you do will change that. You don't have that power. Other people get to make their own choices.

You control you. Cut contact and keep contact cut. Block her everywhere. Frankly, it doesn't sound like her attempts at gossip have been very successful, and if they were, that would be a thing to address with the people who are *actually your friends* and who you have relationships with—not with her directly because she is not your friend and you don't want a relationship with her.

This girl has your number. She knows how to get a reaction out of you. Even in cutting contact, she's spun you right up. Stop playing right into her hands with melodramatic attitude. You will not out-asshole her and this is not any sort of movie or comic book bullshit where you can write everyone else's lines and behaviours.

"Document document document. 

You need to put your foot down and hard because people like this love weakness. If you continue letting yourself be undermined, they're going to just keep doing it.

Don't be emotional and try not to show any stress during any meetings with them. Be calm, factual, procedural. You are in the right and people like these two tend to dig their own graves when confronted. 

Everything that you do and say, make sure it is documented in an official capacity, meaning make sure there are official witnesses and documents. If Sarah and Janet say that they are not going to do the schedule anymore, then write an email/letter to them reaffirming what was said...and make a copy, that way you have ammunition if they start acting out again.

Don't let yourself fall into a role of feeling like an imposter (Google Imposter Syndrome). You BELONG in that position, and you were promoted because you do good work. You don't need to let these women overrule you and undermine you. Put your foot down (but always stay calm and professional) and don't be afraid to challenge what they're doing.

Love is a feeling it's not real it's not tangible.  it's something you put work into feeling every single day.  


there is no one right person for you.  that is a bullshit concept.  there is merely people you make a conscious decision to choose to be with.

let me guess, she's high on the attractive scale for what you think you deserve.  but she's not attractive on the inside dude.  she's not,  she's manipulating you and she's not right for you.  you are not right for her.  



you'll read all these comments, you'll listen to your friends tell you everything people on here are telling you.  and you'll ignore all of it and stay with her for a very long time because you think this is what you deserve and you think this is what love and healthy relationships are.  and you'll be miserable and not even realize it.

"There's this way of articulating how things are supposed to go in times of trouble.

Something like, the injured party (nephew) is the center of concentric circles. His closest people (you and husband) are the first circle surrounding him, those a little further out (your mom) are the second circle, etc. The mental image is that all support flows in toward the injured person.

Your mom must not burden the more inner circles or the injured party with her emotional distress. She's only supposed to send love and support in toward nephew. That doesn't mean that she isn't legitimately grieving. The point is that she must seek support from the circles that surround her.

"What a bunch of idiots. It's obvious that the other plans aren't ""more important""-- it's just that, as with most things in life, stuff that gets pencilled in the books first gets precedence. How they've gotten to this point in life without learning this is beyond me. Actually, they probably are just the type of people to bail on shit they've planned because they found something last minute they want to do more, which makes them selfish and inconsiderate. Guarantee you there's more than one person out there who stopped being friends with more than one of them for that kind of shit already.

You need new, mature, nonpetty, noncontrolling, and nonjudgmental friends. Anyone who would call not being able to afford two expensive trips within one month a ""stupid excuse"" has clearly never really travelled outside their privelaged little bubble. Maybe with age and experience they'll mellow the fuck out and gain some perspective, but I don't recommend you stick around to find out."
"Here's what I would do in these situations:

1. Do you have an admin for your group? Reply to your boss and say ""Sure, I'll work with Kathy to get a meeting scheduled."" You can use something similar for requests from others: ""That's not really part of the data management role. Perhaps ask Kathy?"" If you don't have any admin, then you should leave, because it won't get any better. A lot of companies think they can get away without having an admin to save money, but what happens is the most junior person has to do it. 

2. I would let this one slide, because its coming from someone who clearly knows your role. Consider going to him for advice on how to push back when you get assigned menial tasks.  

3. You need to escalate this to the boss. Make a chart of the last 10 or so weeks, and list when you received each engineer's report and what follow-up you did before you got it. Explain that you understand the engineers are very busy, but not having to do this much following up &amp; compile their data last minute would free up a significant amount of time for you to work on other things. Ask if they can speak to the engineers about this. I'd also suggest calling a weekly meeting where the engineers report out their updates. It's one thing to ignore an e-mail, it's something else to admit in front of everybody that you're unprepared. Ask if your manager would be willing to attend to lend credibility. 

4. You handled this correctly, although your manager does not seem to exactly be emphasizing that ""support role"" does not mean secretary. Another thing to do is just ignore it. Let them go to your boss and complain that you didn't handle their PTO form. When they follow up, say ""I assumed you sent me that by mistake. That doesn't have anything to do with my role."" 

5. When engineers delegate work to you that's their responsible for, assume that they are asking you a favor because they're swamped, not because they're entitled to delegate their shit work to you. You could say something like, ""Gee, Larry, I'd love to help you out this time, but I'm really swamped myself with my work. Maybe one of the other engineers can help you out?""  That said, in this one case, I understand why he asked for this, if you do it for other people.  It kind of sucks that on-site people have to do work that off-site people don't have to. "
"If he didn't quit his job, you wouldn't be forced to become a ""sell out"", so he can't say squat.

Sure, it's not nice to call him out in public, but he provoked you.

Give him a deadline to find a job, and then decide if you still want to keep supporting him if he doesn't meet that deadline.

"&gt;I asked how he intended to cope with litter tray cleaning etc (given his serious weight issues bending down to empty a litter tray would be difficult for him) He presented me with a spreadsheet, he had created with a team rota for cleaning up after the cat and feeding. He had also costed out food, insurance and the actual cost of the cat on said spreadsheet had an expected 'donation' from each team member (On a sliding scale depending on how he perceived their financial circumstances to be. I was paying the most as I am single, earn more and have no dependant children.

Holy shit that is ballsy.  No wonder the support person was so dejected.  Others in the office, who don't like him and had no say in him even getting a cat, would be the ones forced into helping look after it and pay for it!!!??!

In what reality do you come up with that plan and think ""that'll work!""?"

"Your sister is a fucking brat, but your fiance is just as immature for having some petty little war with a teenager.

Your fiance *didn't* taunt your sister first, though.

&gt;""I don't care about your stupid dog. I have my own life""

She didn't give a shit that she was at fault for your fiance's dog getting out, knowing damn well he could've been picked up by anyone, dropped off at a shelter, hit by a car, or any number of things could've happened for her to have never seen him again.

Look, you don't have to go no contact with your sister, but your fiance should. It's stupid to take part in teenage squabbling when you're twenty five years old. You need to tell her to lay off on the body shaming, and if she wants to go NC with your sister, you cannot try to push her into doing otherwise."
"He sounds really insecure. 

Ways of coping:
1. Make a bingo card with your girlfriend of things he regularly says about poor people. When you're around him you two are playing, first to bingo gets a prize, like a massage from the loser later that evening. 

2. Call up a friend afterwards and laugh about him together. 

3. Read the book *The Millionaire Next Door* about how the rich really live. "
"&gt;  It's not a reflection of connectedness to the other person but instead it's an indication of the seriousness of the intention to find a partner.... Her behavior says to me ""I am not interested in being in a relationship with anyone.""

I don't think her behavior does say this though. A huge swath of American dating culture says that the best way to find a partner is to date a bunch of people at once. You can see it in this very thread. She didn't want to put all her eggs in one basket, dating is a numbers game, it could take a century to find a partner if you only date one person at a time, etc.

I'm the same age as OP's GF, and I'm the kind of person who only dates one person at a time. I heard all of that and more when I was on the market. Friends and coworkers basically pressure you regularly, saying that your way of dating is silly and isn't going to work, and don't you want to find someone??

I completely understand why she would have gone on that date, even though she really liked OP, especially since she agreed to it before she even met OP at all. She doesn't want to be the jerk who cancels a date, and everyone around her is telling her that not only is it expected to go on multiple dates, it's stupid not to. 

And then she goes on the date, feels horrible about it, and realizes, ""you know what, screw what everyone else thinks. This multi-dating thing is not for me. I only like OP, and I only want to date OP."" That's not jarring to me at all.

"&gt; I do tend to touch her ""sexual areas"" more often than anything else

I've been your girlfriend in this situation and you *have to stop this*. Every time you randomly come up to her and grab her boobs she's likely thinking ""Oh god he wants sex. *Again*. I don't want sex right now. Should I do it anyway just to appease him? I hate having ""duty"" sex though. But if I turn him down is he going to sulk about how we never have sex anymore? I don't want to deal with that either.""

To you it's an expression of affection. To her, it's a constant reminder about your mismatched libidos, your unhappiness, and the anxiety that comes with the constant need to have sex when you don't want to. You are actively making the problem worse.

&gt;after a day or 2 she'll be upset that I haven't touched her butt in a few days

Have a conversation with her about how she would like you to express non-sexual affection. Can you use your words? Compliment her on non-sexual things. Can you snuggle in front of the TV? If you have the urge to grab her butt, can you stroke a hand down her back or kiss her forehead instead?

Your girlfriend sounds like she has a lot of anxieties around the mismatch in your libidos. She *knows* you want more sex than she does, she *knows* it's making you unhappy - that's why she's trying to gear herself up to have more sex (as illustrated by the picking out of condoms), but ultimately she doesn't want to have sex when she, well, doesn't want to have sex."

"This is going to sound really awful, but.... are you sure she actually has MS? Have you been with her to a doctor visit or is she taking medications from a pharmacy to manage the condition? There are no specific tests for Multiple Sclerosis. It's diagnosed by pretty much ruling out other conditions for the patient's symptoms (differential diagnosis). 

In diagnosing MS, physicians use the following:

1) Blood Tests: This is done to test for and rule out other conditions that may explain the symptoms.

2) Lumbar Puncture: This is done to see if there are abnormalities that *may* indicate MS and to test for and rule out other conditions that may explain the symptoms. 

3) MRI: The doctor should be able to see lesions on the patient's brain that are consistent with MS. However, these lesions are more obvious during the active phase of MS (it sounds like your wife has relapsing-remitting MS) and the lesions themselves may be caused by other things (e.g. viral infection). This is the most common way to diagnose MS. 

4) Evoked Potential Tests: The physician may test the brain's response time, usually to visual stimuli. Abnormal response time can indicate MS, other neurological diseases, or damage to your eyes themselves. This test doesn't seem to be as common as the MRI test.

Basically, when the physician rules out everything else for the patient's symptoms, what's left is MS. If the patient is lying about their symptoms... it's going to be hard to tell."

"&gt;WHere did you get that from? I don't ignore my wife.

""We do go on the trip, and my memory of it is it was a good time. Not my wife's. Somehow there were a few percieved slights which I don't even want to get into.""

This is what I'm talking about. You're going on these trips and being completely oblivious to what is going on with her. And it really makes it hard to figure out what's going on, because you ""don't even want to get into"" it. These sleights are the crux of the issue, and you won't even address them. That's what you need to figure out.

Look. Your family was incredibly rude to your wife. Of course she has bad memories of this trip. Do you have any idea how hard it is to be trapped somewhere full of people who don't want you there, and the only person who is supposed to be on your side takes theirs instead? That's incredibly troubling. No wonder why she doesn't want to go on this trip.

You say that your family treats her warmly, but she obviously isn't feeling that. Either she is delusional, or there is something that you aren't picking up on.

And I'm really shocked that your family knows that she wants her parents to be invited, and to this day the invitation hasn't been extended.

It sounds like she just wants an ally there. You're too busy living up childhood nostalgia to be able to properly be there for her. If her parents really are as much trouble as you say they are, are you two friends with another couple that you could invite?

Nah. He kept talking to her because he wanted to. The rationalization came later, I guarantee. 

I dunno, OP. Only you can decide if this is worth looking past, but if he cheated *and* he's not sorry about it (and refusing to acknowledge it as cheating is the very picture of ""not sorry"") then you'd have to do some serious mental gymnastics to trust him again. "
"You are enabling your son.

You want to know part of why he isn't changing? He doesn't see actions from you for his consequences. No matter what he does, he has a bed to come home to. He has a house to live in. He gets bailed out of his debts and bills paid. 

Why would he want to change when he's not seeing consequences from you? You're literally teaching him ""do whatever you want, I'll always save you!""  But that is not going to help him become self sufficient.

No parent dreams of kicking their child to the street, causing them to possibly be temporarily homeless. But sometimes it's necessary. Sometimes you HAVE to draw a hard line in the sand and say: ""I love you. I want to help you. But until you are ready to change, I cannot keep supporting and enabling your bad choices. I am here for you when you are ready to change and get help.""

Then you leave the door open for him to come back. But to show him consequences you have to stop bailing him out of monetary debts. And stop giving him security. 

Look, I get it. I'm 29. And my mom will still sometimes help me out. But ONLY because I am a functioning adult that sometimes has issues to no fault and repeated bad choices of my own. She would NOT bail me out of car repair debt if I had no job, wasn't working to get one, and was puttering around with a loser and likely using drugs. She only does because I'm gainfully employed full time. And I am working hard, just am occasionally hit with bad luck and need a little extra help. That's how she's helped shape me into a functioning adult. She didn't allow me the option to do nothing, work towards nothing, and still be supported. She'd go to hell and back for me if I was working as hard for myself or if I was truly ready to change from bad choices and fix my life. But she won't subsidize my ability to keep making bad choices. 

That's where you need to get as hard as it is. Get a therapist and work on how to do this."

The good news is that wearing a condom and not banging when you have a sore (yes I know you can be contagious without a sore, but wear a rubber and maybe take that pill?

"Yes, you and she are consenting adults. I am not going to give you a lecture from a morality standpoint. The mother is an overcontrolling asshole with a depressing view of religion.

However, you screwed up in a life changing way and it is going to take you a while, like, one or more years, if not a lifetime, to undo the damage you have done. 

You, too, are pretty sheltered if it didn't occur to you that having sex with the highly sheltered daughter of a very Christian woman from a conservative foreign country wouldn't be a huge violation of trust and a huge problem for your father, whose largesse you depend on for the roof over your head, and his girlfriend.  

What you are supposed to do: get a job, now, because first of all, you are on your own for the foreseeable future, and second of all, you may have gotten this girl pregnant. Do you think highly religiously conservative people are going to run off and take Plan B or get an abortion? I don't think so. OK, you did do well to get the condom on sooner rather than later. Hopefully that will work out. (Edit: might want to try sneaking Plan B to the girl, though) 

So get a job, get your own place, continue with your schooling as well as you can, and welcome to the struggle, because your free ride is now over. 

I'm sorry, but your actions were childish, impulsive, and self centered.  What were you supposed to do when she was trying to have sexy times with you? You were supposed to make a decision whether satisfying your boner made raising holy hell with your father's girlfriend, losing your living situation, and potentially fathering a child worth it. You were supposed to take leadership in this situation, tell her that you can't do this and why, go take a shower, whack one out, and go out and meet a girl from your own culture who is not a potential stepsister to be, or get yourself independent financially and then offer the girl a lifeline out. 

Sorry, dude. I know I'm being hard on you. You are not a terrible person, but you are a bit immature, and sadly, I expect that Pam will bear the brunt of the consequences. 

P.S. Also consider offering the girl shelter with you, because as hard as you have it, she may be getting verbally if not physically abused or be about to be sent back into isolation or who knows what awfulness. That would be an honorable move. Virginity is stupidly important both culturally and religiously for her mother and this girl is certainly in a world of hurt.

Plus, if you're confict-averse, you'll feel ten times worse that there are people 'waiting for you'. 

But besides all of that - it's still really not bad. I've got a situation at the moment where I had a bit of a meltdown a week or two ago. My daughter-in-law's due to have her baby in a couple of weeks, and my sister was insisting that I insist on being present. I was like, WTF? The woman isn't my daughter. I have never seen her without her clothes on. She has the right to not let me do so. She's a grown woman with a choice. AS ARE YOU. You don't have to let another person see your private bits (or even your non-private bits) if you don't want to - not even your mother, and your MIL is nowhere near to being your mother. 

So, just tell him he's in effect wanting you to be naked and screaming and vulnerable in front of another person, and that if HE agrees to getting naked and having a colonoscopy in front of YOUR mother, then you might go some way to seeing his side of it.

Functionally speaking, though, there are a few things to consider. Is this the first time she's ever acted out this way? Is there anything else happening in her life that would cause her stress? You've got a 6 month-old, so post-partum is a real concern here as well.

Just as in the other woman's case, the problem is more than the unwanted tickling, it's his complete disregard for you saying stop.

This could be an early sign of abusive attitudes. Holding you down is a kind of control. Ignoring your right to bodily determination is a form of abuse. Escalating after marriage is typical of abuse. Responding to your completely reasonable boundary by sleeping on the couch, giving you the silent treatment, and wanting time apart is manipulative. He might not be an abuser, but he sure looks like it from where I sit (in front of my computer).

YES. Your GF is 28 years old and definitely wants kids. She's got a limited window of fertility, and being with you is wasting her time. Because realistically, I don't think you want kids. I think you want to want kids because you know your GF wants to have kids and you don't want to break up. But you don't actually want kids. I have a feeling that if you broke up with her, you'd suddenly find yourself a lot more sure about how you feel (and it would be that you don't want kids). I had the same feelings, only from the other side of the coin when I was dating a childfree man. Once we broke up, I knew that I had just been trying to convince myself to save my relationship."
"I have someone in the office who is guiding me through it if I have questions, but I feel like she is getting really annoyed because I'm always asking for her help.

"You get that you might have been the catalyst for her sleeping with the friend, right?"
"Your boyfriend is an insecure idiot. Comparing it to a sugar daddy situation is really creepy. It's your *grandpa* ffs.

I couldn't be with someone who acted that immature and ridiculous. "
"Holy shit OP. *Choking??* Your mom is off her rocker. That's not normal. If I witnessed that I would see that she ended up in JAIL.

Her apology should just be ""That was wrong and I have no excuse. I'm sorry.""  I can see why you wouldn't be satisfied with her bullshit hormone excuses. 

If you still love her and want her in your life, that's okay. You can do what you want. But please keep this in mind when *you* have kids...I don't think I'd want her babysitting. People change, so it might be okay, but it's something to think about. 

Good luck OP. My parents have done pretty screwed up things, and I still keep them around. So I get it. It's okay to forgive. But it's also okay to cut toxic people from your life. "
"You don't really know someone till you see how they react in stressful situations.  Now you know.  He shuts down and shuts you out.  See how long it takes him to come out of this.   How does he react?  Does he yell at you?  Call you a stupid idiot?  Or, does he say it can happen to anyone and he's glad it worked out?  

When he comes out of it, ask him why he reacted that way and ignored you.  Was he working through anxiety and trying to stay calm?  Or, was he mad at you, blamed you for everything, and was disgusted to be with you?  Very different reasons to shut someone out."

"- pics of children

A lot of people want NO pictures of their children on the internet. I don't know if this is considered extreme or not, but it happens. No mather what one thinks of that, the parents wish needs to be respected.

- (step)grandma

Well, no. Marrying someone with adult children does not necessarily make you their step-parent, or their childrens step-grandparent (in my book, at least). 

My grandfather remarried when my mom was already an adult and I was born. They tried to push the ""grandma"" angle hard, but I just couldn't. Nice lady? Sure. My grandma? Nope."
"I don't think you have to know first hand that abuse is happening to report it.  You can just tell CPS or DCFS that you suspect that he is being abused, and you can even do it anonymously, so your family doesn't have to know it was you.  Also, OP, FWIW it sounds like you have an incredibly difficult family, and I hope you're okay."

"Imagine how long your BF rooted around in her room before making this discovery. Surely he didn't just magically find it in the first place he looked. This is completely uncomfortable and gross. OP, you need to put him in his place in regards to his entitlement of thinking he has the right to snoop through your daughter's room... or even be in there at all, for that matter. I'd also let him know that his backward-ass thoughts on human sexuality are not to be mentioned to you (and certainly NOT to your daughter) again... but that's just my personal stance on the issue, you may feel differently. 

What a massive overstepping of boundaries. I would seriously consider revoking his house key privileges. What a fucking asshole. The glaringly obvious problem here is him. Please make sure to ensure your daughter that this creep will never step foot in her room again. "

"Honestly, from what I read, he was a child brought up in difficult circumstances, but managed to get himself out of there and to become a better person. If you never felt threatened or scared of him, I don't think you have a reason to be now. 
Otherwise we can only read what you wrote about him, so the only person capable of making the decision of staying or leaving is you. I can just say, from your description, he seems to be a good guy with a troubled past but a bright future. "
"Your wife just deliberately made you sick and you think the best this is to ""let it slide"". You are a fool.

Acid reflux can cause esophagual cancer.    

Your wife thinks that your health problems are fake, the pain, the mucus etc, are all in your head, she also thinks you are a fool.   

This isn't the first time she's done this.  Whenever she puts stuff in your food and you don't complain she takes it as a sign that she is right, she'll continue doing this because she's smarter than you and the doctors, yeah that scarring of your esophagus that's in your mind dude.  


Your wife is delusional, and she thinks that you are making up your illness, she has no respect for you, and based on her response no love.  Good luck with the rest of your life with her.  I wouldn't eat a damn thing this woman made.  I'd be sleeping with one eye open."
"Piggybacking on this to add that there's a chance that you haven't been downplaying your triggers as casual preferences as well as you think you have, and that can be very frustrating to someone who shares a lot of life with you and wants to share a lot of life with you. He wants to be able to make plans and do things with and for you and know that they'll be welcome and good for you, and not bring you pain. It may be very frustrating for him to be in a position of trying to plan and suggest things and be denied and shut down without understanding the impetus behind it."
"You are getting treated for your mood disorder. Now he needs to step up and get treated for his. What that looks like is up to him, but he *needs* to work on himself. He's part of family now, and his moods affect the rest of you.

"Dean's ex actually took Randall to a psychologist this summer for a screening because she thought his issues making friends were a sign he was autistic - after six weeks of appointments, the psychologist said he didn't show any signs of autism, but possibly had a defiant disorder (?).  I want to say that Randall is still seeing a therapist in some capacity, and has definitely seen therapists for his behavior in the past."
Agreed. The OP should replace the post with this comment. Or Reddit should be renamed with this comment.
"No, but it's not exactly fair to complain about ""not having had sex in a while"" when you had it just hours ago.

If by ""her sex drive is lower than mine"" OP means ""she isn't in the mood for it twice a day"" then that's a completely different story."
"Here's hoping that the other commenter's suggestion works.  As a minister who has performed more weddings than I can even remember at this point, I can tell you that having a wedding party that is fully invested in taking care of the wedding couple on the big day goes a *long* way toward making the event a happy memory for everyone involved.  

For many people, the wedding day is the single biggest event in their lives; it's a happy day, but it's none the less emotionally draining, and there's no real way around that.  The absolute *last* thing a bride and groom need to be dealing with, on top of the monumental surge of emotions that they have inside themselves, is to have to worry about whether someone else is going to have a tantrum in an attempt to steal the spotlight."
"Putting any blame on OP for this is just awful. There's *no* excuse for what her cousin did, and the fact that she could be making a bit more of an effort to work out (etc) is truly irrelevant to the cousin's actions. "
Does he just like make you sit in the car or something??? This is so insanely controlling I'm almost speechless.
"Seconded!  Phrasing the question as ""What can I do for you, right now?"" will give you an actionable answer instead of a yes/no (""Is there something I can do?"") 

 It's usually easier for the person because it saves them a decision step of ""I dunno....is there something they can do?...."" and instead frames it as ""of course there is something they can do"".  Gets the ball rolling a bit faster without as much pressure :)"
"Also a therapist,  all this! "
"That's exactly what I was going to say.  Between Facebook's ""On This Day"" and apps like Timehop, many people get a notification about what happened previously, and I'm sure that's what causing the messages.  Just thank them and move on

* they obviously like you 

* they probably had a decent time at the wedding, if they are still talking about it 

* they are trying to be nice "
"There's a couple of things here.

One, yes you most probably have replaced one addiction with another. Replace 

&gt; I'm addicted to sex work, it's the only thing that motivates me to shower, to get out of the house, to ""turn on"" my positive energy, the easiest way to channel my focus.

Sex work here with heroin and you'll see just how dangerous a state you're in. This doesn't have anything to do with the morals of sex work, but that you find it your sole driving force. Your other symptoms before that resemble in some ways withdrawal as well as the depression you already recognize. 

But as for would you date an ex-escort, I don't know. But I can say one thing for sure: I only would if I knew from the start. If it was hidden and I found out later, no way in hell would I be able to get past that. Yes, most people will find a past in sex work unacceptable. But nobody will find a *hidden* past in sex work acceptable. 

You need to get yourself together first though. You recognize you have an addictive personality and you're bouncing between addictions. You need to either control it or find healthy outlets for it, and when you say your sole reason to live is how you perk up when your pimp calls you is as far from healthy as it is possible to be."

"Sometimes you're so focused on not being abused that you wind up picking a still pretty shitty partner after leaving an abusive relationship. 

This guys sounds very selfish. Without considering that it was a couples trip,i'm still not very impressed that he decided to leave you alone at a hotel while he went out with his friend and then has the gall to complain that ""everybody had fun so why are you ruining it"". 

He planned a romantic trip, he needs to remember. If he changes his story and denies that it was a romantic trip when he proposed it, he's gaslighting. "

"If I could add gold to this comment, I would. You and I sound like we have a lot of life experiences in common but I wont divulge why as this is already going to be a wall of text.  Please take these answers to heart, OP.  You know in your heart our replies are valid and have steps you really should take. Don't live with the regret of having stayed, for your innocent baby girl, and for your own wellbeing and sanity.  While a professional has not diagnosed my own father, he too has all the signs and symptoms of PPD, and I had a miserable, abusive childhood I barely endured.  And I have absolutely no relationship with him now and haven't for the better part of a decade in total.  And my relationship is incredibly strained with my mother. I have a lot of resentment towards her for staying with a man who was paranoid and abusive, and my sister and I have been in therapy for it on and off for it over the years that still hasnt resolved anything for her and I.  My mom seems to have a habit of putting her men first (she is remarried and puts his feelings ahead of her kids). Please, don't stay with him. Leave this situation for baby girl. Don't let him fuck her up with him being her first example of a man.  Don't stay stuck in a mistake of a relationship just because time and money has been invested. Your example as a woman and being the best mom you can be should be priority #2, behind both of your safety.  If you value having a strong relationship with your daughter in the future, you need to get out of this situation ASAP. Also, not to be morbid or dramatic, but the #1 way women die while pregnant is via murder. Google it. People with PPD can be unpredictably violent. Be as cautious as you can when you attempt to leave him. He has expressed violent tendencies at others who he has imagined having ""wronged him"" and he may suspect you're leaving because theres another man. My father stalked my mother when she left him. As a kid I used to stand there and watch them fight in case he hit her or choked her again, just so I could be a witness for her in case police came. No kid should have to do that. You see a fork in the road ahead of you now. Please take the smart and safe route and not the unpredictable, dangerous, and miserable one. "

"I think the key word here is ""support."" Be there to support him, but like /u/toldyaso said, don't try to fix the problem. Don't feel frustrated or disparaged if he doesn't feel better soon. Be patient, and know that being there is the most/best thing you can do.

And please don't forget to communicate. After the 48 hours are over, ask him if he needs privacy or if he would still like you around. Make sure his response is sincere and not an answer he thinks you want to hear. "
"Are you sure you want to let her give a speech?  If she never has anything good to say about you, and she's having power struggles with you over your wedding, it seems likely that will come out in the speech.  It might be a good idea to move her speech to the rehearsal dinner or ask your mother to read your sister's speech beforehand or something.  

As for the sibling relationship, I think what you've been doing is the right approach.  Keep her at something of a distance, but keep trying from time to time to have positive experiences together.  At 20, she still has a lot of growing up to do.  But if you are never close, life will still go on. 

One thing you might try to pay more attention to is how your parents talk about both you and your sister and treat you both.  Maybe the core of her jealousy comes from their comparisons between the two of you.  If so, you probably have to address it and start combatting it before the sister relationship can become more healthy.  "
"If the genders were reversed, everyone would be calling this sexual assault. Your cousin got naked and climbed on top of your husband without his consent after being told to stop multiple times beforehand when touching him inappropriately and sharing intimate feelings. She has no respect for either of you. To touch someone inappropriately and then climb on top of them naked against their will is *incredibly* messed up, not to mention that that person was someone who was a father figure to her who is married to someone who saved her life. Her selfishness, arrogance, and complete lack of respect and concern for you and your husband is evident, and honestly I'd go no-contact after this. 

How would your husband be reacting if this was a man that got naked and climbed on top of you after you told him multiple times that you weren't interested? You need to start thinking of Kimmy like that. "

That's not on you. 

At this point it seems like she may be using your ADHD as a scapegoat for unrelated issues she's having with you. You need to have a serious conversation with her about that. "

Not to you.

Definitely ask your therapist how to cope with this. I've broken up with people who are relentlessly negative, usually after having repeated versions of the same conversations that you have had with your SO.

It's not dramatic at all.  NO-ONE has the right to put their hands on you.  If he pushes and grabs you again, get out of the house right away and call the police when you are somewhere safe.  You don't live together, do you?

You are under-reacting and justifying his actions, also blaming yourself.  This is very common for victims of abuse and I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.  I have been there, too.  I left my ex fiance 2 months before our wedding because he started doing the same things.

Your girlfriend is an adult. She is capable of making her own decisions. She is just as capable as you are. Just because her decision is different from what you want doesn't mean it's illogical or irrational or rash. Most people don't walk away from a 4 year relationship unless they're sure.

Respect your partner enough to let her make her own decisions. Respect *yourself* enough to not stay in a relationship with someone who doesn't want you. You can find someone who wants to be with you as much as you want to be with them. Why wouldn't you want to be loved?

And please, examine why you think you know better what is going on in your partners head than she does. You keep blaming her turning 30 for this decision, but you have no reason to. You're grasping at straws. I get it. It hurts. You're heartbroken. But don't infantilise your girlfriend in order to make it ok in your own head. And try to think if these attitudes towards women go deeper than this event. Do you tend to think of women as emotional, rash, illogical? Because if you do that is highly offensive, and it *will* come across in everyday interactions, and especially in relationships, and it *will* drive women away."

"That work schedule sounds incredibly stressful. It sounds like you have no family life at all. 

I know.this has nothing to do with what you asked; just an observation. Being on pure survival mode for indefinite periods of time is not good for any relationship. 

Also, if you are living so close to the bone, you would save a lot of money if you personally did not go, not to mention if there were any kids involved. 

P.S. If he decides not to go without you (which I'm sorry, sounds kind of manipulative), then by the money you save and the week you would have off, you could certainly afford one or two appointments of couple's counseling. "

"I think it would be a good idea to see a therapist. I doubt the therapist will think she's being silly. Therapist hear all sorts of things everyday from people, hers should be no different.

Crazy as it sounds (I'm sane), I don't think she's crazy. Her mom exposed her to something really bizarre and frighting at a young age and kinda scarred her. Everyone handles things differently.

I'm no therapist and Idk if this relates but maybe some type of exposure might help? What's the least scariest thing for her? Let's say having the lights off....Maybe she can sleep with the lights off (with you beside her) for one day or a brief time to show her, there is nothing or no one there. Than gradually work your way up?

Sorry if this is shitty advice, lol, just hope she can get some help.

"I had a similar take on it.   they have been dating 4 months, this was supposed to be first time OP is meeting her parents.   they are not in high school but that is still an important meeting if things are serious. 

and she uses it as a giant prank to feed her actor friends ego.    

My guess is that she is good at acting as a GF, but OP is more a placeholder bf for her amusement than a serious partner.    I get different sense of humor, but this is a completely alternate mindset. "

"&gt; I feel like the logical solution is to leave, but I simply can't when I'm four weeks away from giving birth. Logistically, it isn't feasible.

It is always feasible when the situation is this dire. You wouldn't be the first woman who had to pack up and run at 9 months pregnant. 

Go to a shelter if you have to. Ditch your phone and get a cheap burner. Give the number only to those you trust. Do you trust your dad to back you up? If so, ask for a loan. You can pay him back later, but you need money and an ally *now.* 

The stress of an infant will *not* improve his condition, and chances are very, VERY good that it will worsen. To the point where he poses a threat to both you and your daughter. You're thinking the damage won't occur until she's old enough to have opinions and beliefs, but you're facing much more immediate danger. Do not take the risk. You will only be more vulnerable during and after the birth. Now is the time to run."
"I find it odd that you said you need to have ""a place to hide"", specifically that you used the term ""hide"".  I'm not accusing you of anything, but I suspect your reasons for sleeping apart aren't for simple comfort and easy sleep when you use that word.

"100% this. When his friends badgered him about going out his response should have been ""I broke OP's trust and did something stupid and irresponsible.

Mission accomplished."

"OP said the in-laws will eventually forgive him so she doesn't know how to continue her relationship with her in laws. So in a sense, she wants the in-laws not to forgive him so she can continue to hang out with her in laws. 

I also agree with the commenter because seriously, OP can't expect the entire family to cut ties with Allen because of this (for her). Yes, what he did is wrong and she should never forgive him or see him ever again. I don't see why OP can't have a relationship with the in-laws if they forgive Allen."

"Yes, I agree with all of this! I also think it explains why I'm against the idea of a do-over. Renewing your vows when you're a cute old couple that's been married forever is one thing. But you've been married three years, OP. Most people are not going to respond well to a do over wedding for a couple that hasn't been married all that long because they didn't really like their first wedding, they just had to go through with it anyways to get money from all their guests since they couldn't get their deposits back. It's really kind of rude. So yeah, my advice is to take your wedding anniversary off FB if you have it on there, say thank you when people tell you happy anniversary, and try to find a way to make that date special. Other people have given good suggestions on that - a special trip, a fun Vegas vow renewal just the two of you, something. At some point have a nice anniversary party you two can plan - but please, not at the three year point. "

"From the insights you provided, I seriously wonder if this is a manifestation of abandonment issues. She has misinterpreted the kindness you and your husband have shown and broken your trust by crossing boundaries that friends, let alone family members, do not cross. Children who feel they have been abandoned have a strong desire to feel ""wanted"" and seek out approval. If they don't work through these abandonment issues as they grow up, this may manifest in self-destructive, inappropriate behaviors to gain favor with people in their lives and ""feel wanted"". If that's the case, I hope she goes to counseling and gets help for her self-destructive, selfish behavior before she hurts anyone else."

You can't expect her to pay you back. You made the purchase 100% yourself 
"The reason is because they’re my clothes, no one else’s. I have certain issues when it comes to personal boundaries and things that are my own. I have no problem with not wearing them in front of her or keeping them out of sight if she’s over. In any case what I choose to do with my clothes isn’t important, they’re important to me and not because they’re gifts from an ex. They’re clothes that I like and really that’s all there is to it. If she had earrings or shoes or clothes an ex gifted her that she likes because they look good on her then I wouldn’t kick up a fuss over that. 



You’re making it into a them or her situation. I should not have to give up clothing because someone is uncomfortable, a gf, a friend or a family member. So donating them isn’t an option simply because they’re mine and I enjoyed them. Well, not anymore because they’re gone. They made me happy when I was wearing them. Why should I have to toss away something that makes me happy when I’d already taken the steps to keep them away from her ? She was the one who’d see them here and there in my home and still become irritated even after I stopped wearing them. Shouldn’t she have to find some way to move past her own hang ups? If I was already making an effort then couldn’t she do the same ? It shouldn’t have to be a 100% effort on my end when it takes two to tango.



Of course if it was something that had massive emotional value I’d understand but for me, I just like them because they’re nice clothes that I happen to look good in.



In any case what matters here is that without so much as a conversation, she went into my home and tossed my clothes into the trash.

"He tried to become her partner during pregnancy and is now trying to become a favorite ""uncle"" to your daughter. Honestly, it sounds like he's trying to edge you out. He wants to pretend you don't exist and play your part if you let him.

I would NOT be okay with someone who tried to have a close relationship with my young child and my spouse, but was actively antagonistic towards me. 

It sounds like your wife is handling it well, but the situation needs more boundaries. It's time for a long talk with your wife. I don't think you'd be out of bounds to ask her to put some distance between this man and your family. "
"And make sure he has proved himself capable of enforcing those boundaries. He might agree to all kinds of things, but once confronted by his family, he could start leaning on you to compromise the boundaries you thought were solid.

Maybe visit them for a bit and see how he acts around his family when you need your own space. If he handles the situation well, good for you both. If he starts making excuses and pressuring you to do things you don't want to, that's a good indication of how he will act when they live next door (shudders)."

Furthermore, you say ""can't relate"" but you never had an interest in those topics before and just liked listening to her talk about them.

It sounds like you want her to be a living wikipedia that you can ask about various topics. You have google homey, use that instead and educate yourself since you claim you don't know anything about them but love hearing about them.

Also, try to engage her new interests rather than nagging her for letting go of her previous ones. Embrace the new. If she's interested in celebrities, she probably watches shows/movies they're in. Maybe watch those with her. Accept who she is right now and see the good in it, its your problem not her's."

Yes, thank you. It's quite obvious that he was just as perturbed at the thought of her masturbating in general as he was the toy sharing (by checking the browser history and screeching about how OP needs to be stricter with her.)

It's backwards as fuck and has no place in a sex positive household that doesn't penalize or judge her daughters for normal sexual exploration, if that's what OP is going for, anyway."

"You have to nip this in the bud now. She is taking advantage of you and probably looking to get free baby sitting so she can have time to herself. That would be fine if she was reciprocating.

"Speculation: he views dating as a necessary evil, something you put behind you once you find someone to commit to. To him, the fact that you're still thinking about dating (even for other people - interpreting what a flirty message means, thinking about what the best response would be, seeing other guys' profiles and approaches) means you haven't ""moved on"" and aren't fully committed to him. You're still in a ""dating mindset"" that he thought you'd left.

This is just speculation, mind, and if it's accurate, I think it's rather ridiculous. It's basically saying, well, you did well enough on Tinder to get *me*, so now you can just discard that part of your brain because I don't want any of your headspace given over to other men. If you're still thinking of ways your own experience as someone who successfully started a relationship via Tinder could help your friends looking to do the same, that means you enjoy ""playing the game"" and thus aren't really happy with him. It's... insecure is the best I can probably say about it, and honestly, his refusal or inability to articulate his issue with it in any clear or reasonable way is worrying."

How awful *has* she been in the past?  

I would imagine pregnancy hormones have something to do with it, but enough that it can explain away her bad behavior.  Pregnancy isn't exactly like the movies show where women shouldn't be held accountable for their actions.  It just doesn't work that way.

Even if she has the baby and levels out again, I don't know how you guys could recover from this. "

"Oh yeah, absolutely. Let's not forget that part. It's not just pathetic, it's really creepy [Edit: In my opinion. Apparently that needs to be said.] The break down of events: 

1. OP sees boyfriend essentially feeling up his ex, while she, by OP's own account, tries to escape. 

2. OP goes up to boyfriend to rather rightfully ask ""What the fuck?"" Ex Girlfriend uses the distraction to get the hell out of Dodge. 

3. Boyfriend tells OP they will talk about it later, then takes off after his ~~victim~~ ex girlfriend like Wile E. Coyote after the Roadrunner. 

4. OP wonders what they should do. 

Honestly, I think OP should pat themselves on the back for helping out a woman (who was minding her own business, trying to stay fit and healthy at the gym) get away from her creepy ex and get the hell away from him themselves. "

No, you're not being paranoid. She's being shady, so unless she's upfront, I don't blame you for assuming that a sudden influx of money signals her return to sex work. It's the most obvious and likely scenario, and until she not only denies it but also explains where the money *is* coming from she's just reinforcing that likelihood."

Your bf failed to have it properly trained, failed to have it properly restrained, and left it unattended (crate or not) when someone else was in its territory.

You have a bigger problem, though - a man who wants you to go along with huge lies against an innocent woman, just to cover his own ass.  That speak volumes of his character.  And if you go along with it, it speaks to your character as well.  You shouldn't be ""conflicted"" at all.  This would be a dealbreaker."

OP! Get out of this controlling relationship!
"I think if anyone is going to do anything, it should be your girlfriend. She is the one that needs to sit down with her dad, without you, and let him know that what he is saying is inappropriate. She needs to tell him that it offends her to hear her father talking about her boyfriend and his family in this way. She needs to stand up for you. 

If her dad is a good man, he'll apologize to you. If he's a mediocre man, he'll never mention it again, or maybe try to save face by making a joke next time you see each other. If he's an asshole, he'll get angry for being called out, and if he's stupid he'll threaten you or your job. How he responds determines how you move forward.

On another note, make sure you and your girlfriend are communicating openly about your views on wealth and finances. She seems like a lovely person, and it sounds like you might be considering staying with her for the long haul. Speaking as someone who grew up poor and is marrying someone whose family comes from great wealth, your different life experiences can and will surface during times of conflict. Being open and understanding helps.

Best of luck!!"

"Periods don't make you have, like, a total break with reality. They don't take over your thought process or make you say/do things like a zombie.

Periods are sorta like being sleep-deprived. You're a little on-edge, you're a little more likely to snap at someone who is irritating you instead of keeping a lid on it, you're a little less able to articulate your feelings politely.

The stuff your girlfriend rages about, period or not, is what she actually *believes*. Those are her values - are they yours?"
"Ah, I can understand being hurt much more then.  Still, when getting to know someone new there is often more to talk about - she known your thoughts on [whatever topic] but might be curious as to his.  With that additional information I'd frame it in terms of if you are getting enough or not.  If you are happy with the amount of contact you guys have than whatever else she is doing with her time doesn't matter (assuming no relationship agreements are broken).  If you are feeling neglected, or just want more time/attention, that's something to address separately from her texting him so much.

Basically it's better to ask for additive changes (do this) than for subtractive ones (don't do that).

Good luck! "

"He admitted it because he wants to believe it's normal. If you sit there and listen, then maybe he's not a rapist, right?

The right thing to do here is to treat it like what it is, rape. He forced sex upon someone who didn't want to have it. She tried to stop and he wouldn't let her stop. That's rape. Every time. It might not be easy to prosecute as such, but that doesn't change what it is.

Your friend confessed to raping his girlfriend. I suggest you break off your friendship with him, tell him never to do that again to any woman and never discuss it with any man, because the last thing you would want for him is that he would go away thinking you weren't disgusted, or that what he did wasn't rape."

"He fucked up. Someday, you will fuck up.

Shit happens in a marriage. He didn't cheat on you, he didn't bring in a secret drug addiction, this is NOT the end of the world. You said he feels terrible about it, so its not like he doesn't care. All your anxiety is based on finances. Meet with an advisor to work out your best course of action. 

FWIW, I know what it's like to come from nothing and become something. I understand why you're terrified. But do you really want this anxiety to be what destroys your marriage? You might want to talk to someone before it becomes total resentment. "
"I think that if you want to maintain an actual friendship with him (and I'm not so sure you should, but you know him best) then you should be honest about how shitty his behavior was. This is also a favor to him, so he can improve himself.

"Why is this even a question? Tell your wife dude. This post makes me angry just reading about it. How could you possibly think anything good would come from hiding something else from her after she literally walked in on you fucking someone else?You need some serious therapy to figure out why you're so damn selfish.

I predict doom for this marriage. Shall we take an over/under 5 years tops?"
Don't consider it. Fucking do it. You could be about to destroy your family over nothing. This is serious shit and it needs to be treated seriously.
"I had an ex that called occasionally after I got married.  She knew my wife as well.  She was a bit narcissistic so it was always about some problem she was having.  The first few times I just told my wife about the call.  Eventually I would just hand my wife the phone when she called, and they stopped pretty quickly after that.  Earlier on I very briefly tried the ""what's wrong with being friends"" line on my wife.  She had a great response.  ""Was she at your wedding?  No?  Well then how good of a friend is she really?""    At best he is trying to hold on to a piece of his past that he probably thinks is part of his identity.  At worst, well let's not go there. "
"To qualify you as a partner? Are you a race car driver?

1 - Were you safe?
2 - Have you been tested?

THAT IS IT! That is the only information that is required. The next time just let them know that you don't feel the information about numbers is important, because it isn't. 

Also, that is the only information they are required to give you as well. My SO and I have never had that discussion other than those questions. Never had any issues.

Good luck."
"Dude. 

Do you even like your wife anymore? Honest answer. I have seen you sing the praises of your sisters in this post but I have yet to see you say one good thing about your wife. You seem to have written off your finances completely, you have about 6 tons of resentment you're hauling around regarding her brother, and it almost sounds like you'd rather have your sister in the house than your wife right now.

None of this is a criticism. Only observations. Do you actually still want to be with your wife?"

Getting married means permanently putting your wife ahead of your twin sister.
"&gt; I feel like I am betraying her by excluding her

Your wedding is about you and your wife, not your sister.

&gt; What happens when we have children? Will my twin get to be involved with them?

Ask your wife this. But in the end, your wife should be your priority, *she's* your new little family now."
"Dude, seriously. I haven't read all the comments, but I've read enough. You're here for validation, not getting it, and arguing with everybody, most of whom are offering decent advice and compromises.

We get it, she's your twin and you don't really give a shit about dudes wife. That's fine, but it's your girl's wedding too, and she's just lost all respect for your sister. And I wouldn't want someone have no respect for in my wedding either.

You've got a couple of choices. 1) show your wife that you're spineless in the face of difficult decisions and willing to wash away any sense of decency for the sake of saving face, or 2) tell your sister that you love her, but don't approve of her recent decisions and that you won't turn your wedding into a gossip furnace; find a compromise your fiance is willing to accept and present a unified front to your sister.

Or you can start your marriage by showing your soon-to-be-wife that she's on her own when difficult situations come up and plant that seed that you won't have an ethical backbone when things get tough. Your choice dude. It's her wedding too. You're spending to much time thinking about ""she"" and ""me"" that you haven't considered the ""we"" part yet. That's bad."

A couple years later it still hurts but at least I'm not being used all the time."
"&gt; She doesn't have a support system outside of myself and my family. No one

Except all the guys she's boning you mean."

Now cut out the apology and you'll be good.
Agree 100%.  I have many nerdy hobbies my wife doesn't share or enjoy.  Aside from some gentle ribbing here and there she respects it and doesn't try to make me feel bad for enjoying the things I enjoy.

"I had to create an account just to answer this, because it strikes so close to home. 

I also  love fanfiction. I used to write in college (when I needed  a creative outlet) and I still read a lot of it. 

About three years ago my (then) boyfriend found out about it. At first his reaction was very similar to your boyfriend's. He sniggered. A lot. He poked fun of me for being a crazed fangirl. When he asked me what I was reading, and I answered ""fanfiction"" he would ask me ""who is taking it up the butt?"" and when I tried to explain that not all fanfiction is smut, he would dismiss it and say ""but why would anybody read something that isn't about nasty sex?"" and get really explicit about it. 

What helped us was a very honest, conversation. (Apparently, despite all his intelligence, he wasn't smart enough to realize that belittling and sexualizing something that was important to me, was not a smart move). I got us to sit down, at  a time that we were both really calm, and explained that this was really important to me. That every time he made fun of it, or made comments like ""who is taking it up the butt"" I felt really hurt. Worst of all it was making me lose faith in our relationship, and left me feeling that I couldn't share important things with him. I said that I didn't want to spend my life with someone who made me feel ashamed of things that I liked.   

He protested, tried to brush it off, kept insisting that I was too sensitive, and he was just joking. But I stayed calm, and kept pointing out that his ""jokes"" were  unnecessarily hurtful  and that I found them insulting and unpleasant. 

I think what really got through to him, was me explaining that I was (for the first time in our relationship) tempted to lie to him every time he asked what I was reading, because I found his ""teasing"" to be so unpleasant.  He never really apologized (not his style), but the remarks did stop. He is now my husband, and though he occasionally still seems bewildered by my love of fanfiction, and says that ""doesn't get it"", a quick reminder of ""you don't have to GET it, you just have to respect it"" is enough for us to end this conversation.

Sorry for the long post, and I hope it helps you handle the conversation with your boyfriend.     "
What did she say? Why was she spinning? I need to know!!
"Nope. Plenty of American women would not be okay with it. 
I personally wouldn't mind (hell, I'd join) but this is a completely acceptable thing to *not* be okay with. "
"I have already talked with the counselor we talked to the last time. She can only see us next week, which is usually not a problem but my wife is trying to talk to my daughter about all these amazing cities she has been and can take Maya to, hence the urgency of my posting"

"Is he aggressive with you?

He doesn't sound like a great person to date ..."
"I won’t comment on your relationship, but I can tell you that living in the city, most of your time IS spent out of the SMALL, CRAMPED apartment .. including meals. 

It’s why you’ll see people just hanging out on the stoop, at the bodega, etc. "
"&gt;I woke up to a message this morning from my friend telling me she thinks I'm making a horrible mistake, that going to NYC was a sign we were rushing this and I should never have traveled so far from my social network with a man that neither she nor I know super well (I think I know him well) and he probably has ulterior motives. She said our other friends agreed and this was a huge mistake.

wtf??? you're taking a short trip to NYC with the guy you're dating, these people are making it sound like you're going to be sold into slavery or something! ""so far from your social network""...I hardly know what to say. I think these people are WAY too involved in your personal life. She's acting like your mom and you already have one of those.

edit: is this just one friend doing this? rethink your friendship with this person, honestly."
"Maybe tell him how what he said not only hurt your feelings, but completely tanked his chances with your friends anyway. Your dilemma of whether or not to keep taking to him will probably take care of itself. 

He's an ass and you shouldn't waste your finite amount of social time on him."
"that is *exactly* what would happen - my kids are turning seven and they routinely forget things they were uber-dramatic about last week.

So, if your wife had been having anal sex with someone else while you were in prison that would be cool?

"Right? So when he's making $100,000+ he will still be responsible for all the couple type stuff, and she'll also be making $100,000+ that will be solely for her. "

"&gt;Now boyfriend wants me to basically tell him about anyone I've ever been intimate with as he meets them. But I think that's ridiculous. I love him, and I don't want to lie to him. But I also don't want to dredge up unnecessary things from my past that I feel have nothing to do with who I am now or my relationships with the people in my life. I just happened to really like sex a lot in my life and didn't like commitement so I've had a lot of partners.

I do not think that this is a realistic assessment of the situation. To me, it sounds like many (most?) of your *current friends* are people who, in the past, you have had a sexual relationship with. This is probably going to be an issue for any serious boyfriend. It doesn't ""have nothing to do with who [you are] now,"" because your current relationships are former sexual relationships.

A partner - a **significant** other - wants to feel like they are special. Right now your boyfriend might be feeling like he's just one of a harem. This isn't a totally rational feeling... but it's not totally groundless, either, it sounds like."
"What does that even mean? A no is a no. A simple ""stop this"" should be eniugh for a rational person to realise that what they are doing is not alright. "
Don't forget he gave $50 when they evacuated from a natural disaster!
"&gt; She used to stay in a rented house by the same people who came from the same region. they drunk/party sometimes, and this is where the thing happened.

Your wife partying with other people was where you decided that you would take the results of an ancestry test, that you only have a middling understanding of, and apply them to determine the parentage of your son, despite the fact that this test is not designed for that purpose? weird!"
"I think it's perfectly reasonable for him to do what he's doing.  It's a small safe, nothing bigger than pill bottles or papers could go in it, right?  I think the idea of a mystery you can't solve is what's bugging you - like a cat that wants to get through a closed door, or a child being told a certain area is forbidden.  I don't think you can draw any rational conclusions about the health of your marriage or your mutual trust levels based on him owning a safe.  Imagine if he had a safety deposit box he never told you about instead - you'd be none the wiser and he'd have his need for limited privacy met.  He's being respectful and demonstrating honesty and transparency by telling you about it."
"You are sooo young, and she is much, much older then you, so thats red flag #1. Second, the way she ""tests"" your love, ""do you love me? do you really really love me?"" classic abuser stance. Her asking you to cut your family and friends off is red flag #3. The red flags could go on for pages, but the conclusion is the same. Depression can make you think/do crazy things. I don't doubt you THINK you love her, but nowhere in your post did you mention why you love her. Is it because you think she is the only woman who will ever love you? Because all I read was, ""no one else will want me..if she leaves I won't find anyone else.."" that is not love.

She is trying to isolate you. Abusers do this to gain emotional, physical, financial and mental control over their victims. She will cut you down, then build you back up. The highs will be really high and everything will be great, but then the lows come, everything is bad, she gets angry, she loses her temper, she calls you names, and she makes you feel like the lowliest slug on the earth. But then she's happy again, she lavishes you with love, sex, attention, she probably even cooks you your favorite meal, she apologizes, and for a while all is forgiven, until the cycle starts all over again. If she eliminates your support system, aka mom, dad, and friends, when the lows come and times get tough, you have no one else to depend on but her. After enough of this you begin to feel that you need her, that you can't survive without her. This is her plan all along. OP please get away from this woman. Leave this horribly toxic relationship behind. Most of the time we don't listen to those that love us the most because we don't want to hear what they have to say, believe me, i've been in that position before. But these are the people that genuinely love you (Mariana does not love you) and that know you the best, they want the best for you, they are genuinely seeking out and looking out for your best interest, if they saw/see red flags with Marianna, listen to them!!!

You will dump her, and life will go on. You will find someone who actually loves you, who actually wants the best for you, who will love your family and friends, and who will want to spend time with the people you love, simply because you love them. Hold out for that! Thats real love, and I promise you it exists."
"&gt; The reason she wants to go back to her boyfriend is because she wants normalcy. 

She may also think that, even though her boyfriend is violent, and has been violent to her, he could be violent towards others to protect her.  "

"If a person is being abused and it has yet to escalate into physical violence, they're always referred to deeper resources because **it only takes one time to be deadly**.

That's what's hammered into our heads, because it's true. It doesn't matter if it's the first or five hundredth time, a physical altercation *always* has the potential to turn deadly."
"I feel like when people from other parts of the country talk about the great parts of LA (beautiful beaches, palm trees, outdoor lifestyle), what they're really talking about is San Diego, but they don't know about San Diego.

"Just wanted to say this: If you two do want to have kids (and if you want to get pregnant, contact me for some good facebook groups for pregnant trans guys!), *BOTH* of you need to cut them off if they aren't better. I'm a trans daddy and my mother never accepted my gender. The way she treated me has really upset our kid and I think it's fucked up his own sense of gender (we're working on it). We had to go NC almost a year ago and it's heartbreaking how much she hurt him.

If she can't respect the man you are, then you don't have to be around her and if you do have kids, you should *not* let her be around them for *their* sake. IT's really hurtful to kids to watch their parents get mistreated."
"&gt;Dude totaled my car. Dude totaled my scooter. Dude used me in really shitty ways all while claiming that I was his ""best friend"".

And you let him. For *years*. Give him the damn pan, just WASH IT WITH A SCRUBBER first. It's his, but you can clean it. And the only person you should be angry with is yourself. You allowed everything. Get some therapy to find out why you let yourself be used for so long."
"Sorry to break it to you, but you want to get married to a dickhead who doesn't care about your health and is accusing you of getting your doctor to lie to him because he doesn't want to marry you. 

ETA: You deserve much better than this. There's a guy out there with every good quality your SO has plus actual decent bones in his body. "
"I have kids b/c my husband changed his mind after 20 years. He's very happy while I'm miserable. I've had to take anti-depressants that's making me gain weight. Don't get me wrong, but the kids are great. However, one of them is disabled. I have to take care of my son everyday and it costs $70/hr if we were to hire a babysitter. 

Even if he was a healthy kid, I'd still be unhappy. I hate other mothers and I hate doing kid stuff. My husband stopped having sex years ago for unrelated reasons and I can't leave b/c having to stay home and take care of my son. Needless to say, this killed my career. I spent more than ten years building it up and would've been making six figures by now. Instead, I'm stereotyped as a soul sucking SAHM living off my husband. Pardon my language, but I really goddamn fucking hate being a mother. 

Please realize this is a deal breaker for you and for her. There's no compromise. Even if there is, one of you will be happy at the expense of the other person's happiness. "

My concern is the bride may grow frustrated as to why her friend is holding up the dress process.  I've seen that happen where someone holds out (but not for pregnancy).  I don't blame her for not wanting to tell anyone.  It just may cause the bride to have hard feelings since she won't understand why she is holding up the dress process for weeks or so. 
"That's honestly one of the worst parts of it, he can't be outside without a leash (he's partially blind) so the fact that she wouldn't have told me if I hadn't pointed out that he was dirty really upsets me. He's my baby."

"So almost as soon as you were tied to him legally he started hurting you and ignoring you when you say stop? That's very concerning.  

Maybe there is a chance you calling him abusive was a wake up call he sorely needed, but I would not bet money on that.  It's much more likely that this will just start a cycle in which he tells you he has changed, is on his best behavior for a few weeks, then starts being abusive again until something happens to kick off another round of apologies."

"Homemade sex coupons are pretty brutal as a 30th birthday present. Can you imagine her friends asking ""so what did OP get you for your 30th?"" and her having to reply ""sex coupons""?

I wouldn't be astonished if the total disregard for her likely feelings means the coupons never get redeemed... "
He didn't apologize sincerely if he tried to convince you that you were overreacting. You should really consider changing your passwords after this because he has shown that he isn't trustworthy around your stuff. How long have you been together?
