You look one spinal accident away from leading the X Men.
Cancer only takes the good ones.   
You're hired
I used to bowl against this guy on wii sports
Use your make-a-wish on some new clothes.
"Your look like you're into poetry slams, dry handjobs, and the word ""actually"""
Took no nut November a bit to literally
Nothing is more Rasta than a middle class white girl who forgets to cut off her admission bracelet
You also look about 13% female. 
The only meaningful embrace you will ever experience is from that shitty hot topic corset
"Sad to report, the eyebrows are still malignant. "
I figured by the time people hit 35 they grew out of this stage in life.  
Men only pick you up cause your tiny hands make their dicks look massive
"The ""Smoked one joint starter pack"""
You could try and roast her but the radiation already did. 
"Sorry to be the one to tell you this, but that scar is where your ovary would be.  Testicles are a bit further down. "
How long ago did you figure out it wasn't a good idea to wear cat ears? 
"""Let me have it, boys""....I take it those are words you use quite often?"
Well this is a nice break from the onslaught of attractive girls posting in this sub for attention.
Tell Kermit we said hi
What kind of bee stung your nose?
I'm curious what compliments you've heard hundreds of times.
"Well, you've already ruined mine."
Your eyebrows would make the perfect mustache for a Mexican old school gangster.
"you're not as mysterious and sexy as you think you are. people don't ""misunderstand"" you, they just don't like you."
"'Wow, you're actually smart.'

'man I'd love to be friends with you'

'you are so much more than your looks'

'how are so down to earth?'

Your eyes are as lifeless as your sexual partners.
Roast?  I will hard-boil you.
"""Forgets"""
I wax my forehead every morning as well to get maximum shine 
I'd be confident to ask you out on a date.
"16yo, looks 24.

Keep smoking and drinking and you'll hit 60 by the time your 30."
Because you're not allowed within 1000 yards of their classmates
"You will be able to avoid the roasts if you pay an extra fee of $5.99/month. 

But by the way, Ajit, no monthly fee can fix up that face."
This just screams Notice Me!!! I’m not basic!!!
Ajit Pai painted lines in his own driveway so he could double park there too
"Probably ""Are you going to just lay there and not move while I do all the work?""...."
You look like you practice crying in front of the mirror.
Because you look like Ed Kemper
You don't need to work for a living. Just sell ad space on that forehead. 
I've seen WW1 documentaries with more color and joy in them.
"Stealing them from a playground doesn't make them ""your kids""."

In 5 years serial killers will tattoo Comcast on their foreheads. 
"You look like the kind of girl that was every guyss ""back-up"" in high-school"
You would be super cute if it wasn't for a certain facial feature.  Who nose what that would be...
You don't seem to develop much. 
The cancer realized what the fuck it was living in and got the fuck out.
I bet your glasses are twice the size of your tits. You could get laser eye surgery and it'd still be cheaper than buying those windshields.
"""Nice tan"""
You made a cancer survivor laugh out loud on that one.
Its a good thing you have large boobs cause if guys tried to keep eye contact with you they might get nauseous. 
I'm sorry Bob Marley..

Yeah, we all understood it.."
"I'd fuck her.

But if you look at me, it's not a compliment."
"The term ""pick up"" being literal in this instance. "
"... ""You're beautiful""

""Yes, I'd love to see you again""

""I'm proud of you""..."
Introducing white people's tupac... OneSac.
At your ages boys will do and say anything for sex. Take advantage of your age. Boys eventually develop standards.
"In five years, you’ll be leaving your three kids from different men with your mom to go to ladies night, so you can pound fifty-cent drafts and then let the bartender do you in the ass to pay for your $4 tab, blow him after as a tip, then go home and kiss your shitty kids with your shitstained lips. Every. Week. "
Jaw locked from the long shift at work last night?
        Fatal Error: Cannot determine breast size

"this right here is the first roast that has actually hit me right in the chest. the format is ""you WOULD be cute if not for ____"" 

and that there, is a way of saying ""you're so close, yet so far. you COULD be this, but this one ugly feature is blocking you."" a way of pointing it out further, giving me that glimmer of hope i can't quite reach.

And that is a good fucking roast. props to you, seriously."
"""We're proud of you"" - your parents."
Show your wrists
"When people say ""fuck cancer"" they don't mean it literally..."
"Shut up, Meg."

"You aren't special. You're like every edgelord loser teenage girl there ever was this past decade or so. I won't bother predicting all the ways in which your life will suck and the ways in which you'll fail, because you know them already. Deep down, you're smart enough to be well aware of what a disappointment you are to everyone who ever tried to mentor you, and still dumb enough to never put forth the effort the change yourself for the better. 

You're a spoiled middle-class, perpetually misunderstood attention-seeker, hence why you abuse substances. You want to be a part of the crowd whilst also standing out as your own person, so you do things differently. Just like all the other girls. Just like your mom was, resulting in the loser she created. 

And by following the same patterns, listening to the same music, thinking the same special snowflake thoughts, and acting exactly like all of them did. 

I'd afford you my pity were it not for your overflowing trashcan and Kardashian-esque eyebrows. "
