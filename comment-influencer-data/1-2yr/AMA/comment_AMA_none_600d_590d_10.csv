How far into her bunghole where you able to get your tongue? Did you just jam that thing in like a starving hummingbird?
But did she mean father?
Quality shit-post right here.  Better head downstairs and high-five your mom!
Someone get this man some blank pages and a pen. I'm buying his next novel.
Probably gonna shoot him in the leg 
"I was physically ill when I realized who it was. I had no idea how to confront it, so I decided to rip the band aide and attack it head on.

He ended up confessing to it all. Gave me some bizarre story of how since it was always just him and his sister their whole life growing up with a single dad, that they grew ""too close"" and that the relationship had actually started when they were 17 and 18. So essentially, he was cheating on her, with Me?

"
"Why are there so many negative connotations on sucking dick? My friend sucked my dick last night, and in return I sucked his. We don't think anything less of each other."
"I actually suspected he was cheating, so I had gone thru his phone and found tons of very inappropriate texts, emails. I just thought he saved said person under his sister name....until, I saw the photos."
Always treating a gun like it‚Äôs loaded.

"This happened many years ago, and I made a complete clean break, block them ect. So I never heard what ever transpired afterwards.

What I did know, is the sisters fiance knew about it, and was actually ok with it.

I had felt like I was on a movie I could not believe it all."
"I was an ordinary infantry in a shock and emergency brigade, we had to stay awake for long periods of night in the cold mountains, one day in june of 2017, during the liberation of mosul, me and my friend ahmed went into a house to check it for militants, just to find a family holding a white flag and they were terrified, the first words came out of the mothers mouth were : are they gone? I was shocked and disgusted from these animals that commited crimes in the name of my faith, we talked to the women named karina (she was a yazidi woman) they raped her and killed her husband, when we found her she was protecting her kids, it was disgusting and I still remember it to this day.
This is not the islam I Know nor the god I worship."
"I am 6‚Äô1‚Äù 

Its about the size of a baby carrot when fully erect. "
"They Hate them, pure and simple, we even found a sunni sheikh in ramadi preaching against ISIS and saying : go fight with your shia brothers against these dogs for it is the truest of jihad.
I have many other stories but this just a prime example."
Thats called child porn You were a minor?Why not go to the cops? 
"1) His original sentence was attempted murder which would have led him to Prison. He accepted a plea of  felonious assault with a bunch of stipulations like never being able to purchase a firearm, several hundred hours of community service, and probation for 5 years. He now has restraining orders from everyone who was involved and isn‚Äôt allowed to contact any of us.
2) no he claimed insanity and that we drugged him. Hard to believe I could force someone to smoke who willingly accepted a blunt to be passed to them lol.
"
"What, the little ones aren‚Äôt good enough for you?"
"Its okay to be gay, bro. Its 2018. "
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?
Well it‚Äôs hard to stand at this point

"I suppose I could send you a PM, but I don‚Äôt know how I feel about that. I have never sent a dick pic to a dude. Come to think of it, I only sent one dic pic in my life and the response I got was as follows:

üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëåüëåüëåüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Yo we homie sexuals in here

I used to be embarrassed by it. Now I will go to one and let it flop around with pride. 
No pics = you're fake. 
"Yeah, that's why you always make sure it's cleared before you pull the trigger. Failed literally all of the basic firearm rules:

1 Always treat every firearm as if it is loaded

2 Never point it at something you do not intend to destory

3 Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot

4 Always know your target and what is beyond it"
and I‚Äôm out 
"Holy shit, there are new episodes of Jerry Springer?

Also, unless something significant has changed, all the guests on the show are actors and the whole situation is staged.  He sang the love song because he was paid to do it. "
Yes very high then I got to the hospital and have been high legally since I got checked in.
"I‚Äôm not mad at him at all, it was a complete accident. He nearly cried apologizing to me after and is still apologizing 12 hours later haha. In his defense he asked if there was one in the chamber and I said no, I thought that I had cleared it."
"To be fair, you're also the only person who goes in there when you are having sex."
Have you thought about going to nude beaches to try to find the person with the micropenis fetish?
I feel like a pedophile every time I play with my prick. That‚Äôs how it feels. 
Pics
"That was over 10 years ago, is it still around? I don't mean that as a joke, I mean it as since social media wasn't as big then as it is today did it go away quick?"
Yes. Symmetry is everything. 
"Very clean, she takes very good care of herself. Enjoyable, yes I like pleasuring people and she seemed to enjoy it. "

"Something tells me he won't be using a computer for a while, or watching tv, or having a phone, or a car, or privileges..."
"I think so, she described it as a feather like pleasure. "
Sounds like you won having the worst roommate award. What are you going to do with it?
"What was his sentence? Did he apologize for trying to murder you? Like ""whoa that was some cray stuff, I'm sorry for stabbing you in the head."""
"&gt;1600 - 200

Fuck I can‚Äôt even afford to die"
"Ok, Logan, two questions:

What do your parents think about you having the sex with your sisters?

How long did it take to grow the amazing beard?"
"Congratulations, you have ruined my appetite!"
I stuck it in a hookers vagina and she pretended to like it. 
How small are we talking?  And for context how tall are you?
Haha...not quite bot
9mm and the pain was non existent for like 30 minutes after the shooting. I feel it now tho lol.
"We had been together 1 year. Yeah, it was pretty serious, we lived practically at each others homes. 
I only told my parents. I was so ashamed, and felt humiliated for not seeing it, or realizing it earlier, as there were probably obvious signs from day one.

We always suspect another woman, but never the relative... lol 

Sometimes, you gotta laugh."
"If I was lying, I think that would make me the first person in all of history to lie about having a micro penis. "
After you shit on it
In all my 70+ years it's never occurred to me to eat some ass.  Tonight I'm going to ask my wife if I can eat her ass just to see the look on her face. 
We was high
"Photos!

How did you confront him about it? (Or would you rather talk about something else? Ponies?)"
You've just killed Santa.
Masturbation is ridiculously pathetic. 
Hes having seconds
I cashed it in and now live with my girlfriend of 2 years. Ended up turning out good :) 
Thats a tough one. It depends on the girl I guess. I have only been laid a few times besides hookers. I told them every time. Its kind of unfair to the girl if you don‚Äôt tell them. Then they have this awkward moment when they have to pretend to not be surprised. Its embarrassing for both of us. 
"Did you just call women a ""bag of organs??""

Holy fuck, you are literally proving every stereotype of people who fuck realdolls. Women aren't bags of organs, we're people, and this might be a shock to you but most guys actually appreciate being with someone they can connect with on a physical and emotional level. 

Also, you don't ""chase women down,"" psychopath. "
Was it an enjoyable / clean experience?
What would you say is the general attitude of the average Iraqi civilian in regards to ISIS? 
Are you going to put her on an all corn and all peanut diet so she is ribbed for your pleasure now?

Don't pass her the blunt
"I'm not sex shaming anyone, but a Mother would probably feel as though there's a difference between her daughter being sexually active, and her 16 year old daughter drunkenly being put on the spit by two guys that clearly didn't have her best interests in mind.


Sucks that happened to you, OP. Sorry."
Why you so bad at doing an ama?
Bout a half inch. 
I hike alone a lot. It's honestly one of the most rejuvenating things to me. 
Hi I'm 20 how long should I grow my beard for?
"On a lighter note, you can always go balls deep"
Mmmmm projection at its finest. 
Did he/she like it?
Come on dude. You're not in love. Download Tinder
Never too late my guy
"I want to know if he found the video of the guy opening the controller and being like where the fuck is my bong and if so, if he showed to his mom as a Hail Mary pass"
Tongue punch that fart box! 
"Based on your comment history, it appears you have a tendency to use Xanax regularly to get high. Were you and/or your friend under the influence of alcohol or drugs when this incident occurred ?
"
He‚Äôs having number two‚Äôs
"The ""drugged him"" thing may have just been on the advice of his lawyer or something.

Did he get kicked out of school?"
did you ever find bugs bunny attractive when he put on a dress and played a girl bunny?
"I hope I am not being rude, but do you up your oral game and have a stash of toys?  If he had significant skills in other areas it would more than make up for it in my opinion."
"WTF guys?

These comments are disgusting.

I know it's AMA but 70% of the comments thus far are ""pics or it didn't happen"" or people implying murder is cool."
"I am a US veteran who served 2 tours in Iraq. I have since felt a very strong sympathy with the Iraqi people as they have struggled through continued violence and infrastructural challenges. I have admired their strength and resiliancy. So i am very interested in your point of view! Thank you for doing this! 

How has fighting ISIS influenced how Iraqi citizens see themselves and others? I know that Iraq is diverse in terms of their population and this has been a source of tension. Has having a common enemy brought you closer? Who did you fight with (the army, police, more informal militias) and what are you going to do now? What was the hardest and most frustrating part of fighting ISIS? Were there any people who left ISIS (surrendered themselves) and what did you do with them?

 How has the civilian population been helpful in your fighting? (Informants, providing food, anything) How have they not? 

What was your daily experience, your daily routine? 

Don't feel like you have to answer all of these (or any of them). Any response would be great. Thank you.

"
"I'm honestly not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this obviously fake story. 

Is this some kind of creative writing assignment or something?

Don't you have school to be at right now?"
[deleted]
Wow! Hope you recover soon. How are things between your friend and you at the moment? Are you mad at her/him? 
Sorry but that line of thinking means you aren't ready for a relationship with another human. Lack of compromise and consideration for your partners feelings isn't going to get you far.
"r/circlejerk is more like it, I doubt he's at all serious. If he is then he's prob just high off his ass"
"Nice to meet you sir, thanks for your sympathies, I really apreciate it.
The fight of Isis brought people together.
Espicially when sayed al sistani, the most renowned shia cleric, declared jihad and men of all of iraq to volunteer he is the man who Saved Iraq.
Yazidis, shias, sunnis, shabak, and sabia all contributed to the fight and even joined al hashed al shaabi, most times we dont get paid because were volunteers and we dont really mind. Its our duty, I fought with al hashed al shaabi woth colaberation of The army and the police force, although al hashed is considerd a terrorist org.( wich is bullshit) we are slowly getting integrated into the Army and most leaders of the hashed gave thier eq. To the government, now Im going to settle down with my fiance.
The civilians were really helpful, espicially children who are so innocent and pire they dont care for themselves and insantly give you info if you have a choclate bar lying around, but the rest of the civiliand are helpful too.
When  a militant surrends we intoragate him for info, then Either we finish him ourselves or the we send him to court ( I know us punishing him is conmdemed by the un but its hard to transoprt them from the northern areas to baghdad), and sometimes we leave it to tribes of the area to decide what happens to militant.
Thank you again, I hope I answerd thoroughly and clearly.
Thanks Again."
"Fawkin this guy gets it. The strange thing is my balls are pretty normal size. Its so unfair that I was given regular size testicles, but a baby carrot for a penis. Im passed that now though. "
"I used to have to pay hookers because I didn‚Äôt want anyone I know in my personal life to tell everyone about my freakishly small penis. Now I don‚Äôt give a fuck. Go tell all your friends, toots. I got my nut off. Thats all I care about. "
"The fact those $1000 were a single payment instead of a recurring one, probably /shrug"
"Stepping in for OP as these are important questions: as long as someone has good general hygiene and goes the extra step to prepare their ass for eating/play, there‚Äôs no bad taste or smell. Earthy would be one way to describe it."
You gotta pump those numbers up
"When I was 16, my brother (13) was shot in the face by his friend - another kids playing with guns accident.  My mother never recovered.  Ever.  She spoke of him coming to her at night and how he was riding his motor bike in the clouds.  7 years later, she left the family and eventually drank herself to death.  2 months ago, my sister lost her only son in an auto accident.  I hope she recovers somehow but have no idea how that would happen as she completely broken, to the point that I'm avoiding calling her because I just don't know what to say.  We're 1000 miles apart, and as soon as we hear each other's voice, we both just begin to cry - then awkwardly say goodbye.  It's torture.  :("

"I'm very sorry for your loss. Losing a child is such a painful experience that we don't even have a word for a surviving parent in the English language. Whatever you do with them, I hope you find some measure of peace. "
