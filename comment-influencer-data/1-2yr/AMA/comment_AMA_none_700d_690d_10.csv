"At what point did you realise you were not elon musk, and was it difficult coming to that realisation?"
"About 4am this morning. I wouldn't say it's difficult, confronting for sure, but I have come to terms with it over that past hour and a half and I think I'm going to be ok. "
"I was bullied mercilessly for looking younger than I was, and even ""sexually"" assaulted by a guy in high school who wanted to make me understand why sex was amazing, only to recoil in horror when he saw that I literally had nothing downstairs or upstairs."
Will you show us a picture? 
Ik this is probably a joke comment but I'm just genuinely curious as to how this would even look
I'm missing all my organs. I did not go through puberty. My body has never responded to hormones.
"There's the question everyone should ask.  A person doesn't just wake up depressed one day and say, I'm gonna stick this needle full of poison in my arm.  Most normal, functioning people of society are completely unnerved by that thought.  It's a process.  It starts with broken relationships, a sense of low self worth, and hopelessness.  Almost all heroin addicts start with pills (unfortunately, most are prescribed by doctors).  Eventually, the pills aren't enough.  They start buying more pills off the streets, the strongest they can get. 
 Somewhere in the mix of bad company, there's a heroin user that suggests, Hey try this.  It's cheaper and lasts longer.  The person says, Omg I would never use a needle.  They say, Oh, you don't have to, just snort it (which seems no big deal since after all, they've been snorting pills for quite sometime).  After snorting it for a while, a seasoned heroin user says, Just shoot it because it's SO much better.  Then, there's the day the person finds themselves with a needle in their arm."
Nice try Mom
What is it like to not be one of the best minds of our generation.
"I was always paranoid I was gonna screw something up at work due to not sleeping for a week so took a xanax night before a shift in efforts to get sleep. Ended up sleeping thru my shift, so no call no show. Didn’t put two and two together so did it again less then a week later. I had already signed a paper saying if I no called no showed again after the first one I would be fired. My assistant manager who could tell I was strung out on something decided to ask me about why I didn’t show up and I fully confessed. Ended up getting put on leave had to go to 7 weeks of intensive out patient rehab, 90 NA meetings in 90 days and get a psych evaluation. Having completed those I was able to return to work but have to continue to attend 2 NA meetings a week and get drug tested randomly about once a week for the first year. They can continue to drug test me for 5 years. "
"America, I have more freedom, I get to actually go out and do things with my friends, here it always feels like I'm trapped like I need to ask permission to breathe. People here are so close minded in ways you'll never believe. Plus, it's beautiful over there, it makes me feel like I'm in a movie, and the seasons !!!! fall and winter !!! I miss them so much !!  Although I will say, with how things are now, Saudi Arabia seems safer for me than America. "
I THINK I KNOW MY QUESTION SIR 
My job is a lot easier now that I’m eating and sleeping on a regular basis (who knew) and I have been able to repair my relationship with my family and a lot of my friends. 
I have XX chromosomes.
Yeah it's ok. I mean I get a fair bit of me time so I have that going for me... which is nice 
It doesn't last forever. Guys are into young girls like 18-26. It's not sustainable. 
Thanks for the answer. I'm sorry this happened to you! :(
Where's my package
fuck that guy
She can’t man. Didn’t you read?
"Are you missing all reproductive organs or just external aspects of them? Did you go through puberty? Do you require ""replacement"" hormones? 

Thanks for your AMA!"
Me either! 
"No questions, just kudos for getting out."
"Aww, honey, no quotes necessary. You were sexually assaulted. The victim's physical attributes have zero effect on whether one is sexually assaulted."
I am lacking a sex drive.
"They live in Paris (I’m near Athens). This was a decision we made together, because they thought I could benefit from the experience."
"&gt; Why is it ridiculous?

The OP didn't go through puberty like the rest of us, so think back a bit, I know when I was a kid and someone told me that when people kiss they put their tongues in each others mouths I was all *""What the?!?  Why would anyone want to do that?!? Ew!!""*  I imagine things are like that for the OP.  When you lack the physical/chemical characteristics the fuel sexual desire the whole premise of sex-for-pleasure becomes a bit of a non-entity.  It is pretty much pointless as the OP said.  Sex, and the *'pleasure'* that comes from it has meaning for others because they have the physical/chemical physiology that allows them to enjoy the act.  Without those characteristics sex becomes pretty pointless and has little meaning."
Congratulations on 4 months! How has your life changed?
That assistant manager probably saved your life in the long run by not firing you...
I do have a urethral opening.
"I have, but it does nothing for me."
How do you pee? Do you have a urethral opening all by itself?
"Do you wear the all black outfit with face covering? If so, say you are out with friends or female family and you are all wearing it how do you know who is who? Do you look at people's shoes or do you just know?

What if your Mom walks ahead of you at the market and you're like....which one is Mom? Does that happen?

I'm not making a judgement on the covering....just curious about the practicalities of it. "
"Well that's fucking sad :/
(The last part)"

They gave me a gender neutral name.
Pretty fucking boring to be honest
I'm not joking. I want to see hahahahha
Never in my life.
"When I got my chromosomes tested. I do identify as a girl, and I present myself in a very feminine way."
"Yup, it's just smooth skin. I'm also lacking boobs."
"I can't have kids because of it, I haven't gone through puberty, and I don't experience sexual arousal. I used to hate myself for being different, but I've grown to accept it, although I do wish I could experience arousal. I'm asexual."
"You think it would be losing contact with all of my family or losing my house, but it was the day I climbed into a dumpster because I was starving.  As I picked up a loaf of day old bread and felt like I'd hit the jackpot, there I was perched up on top of that dumpster, smiling, holding my prize.  I looked over at the backdoor of the bread shop to see an employee staring at me.  It was like my entire life flashed before my eyes and this was my shining moment, that loaf of bread.  All the shame of my life hit me right then and there.  I wanted out, I wanted better."
"OMG!
Not Elon Musk finally answered my lifelong question.
I can die in peace now. "
It is a rare form of Mullerian Agenesis.
"She definitely did. My using had been escalating for a while. 

My store manager told me if he hd been handling it he wouldn’t have asked those questions he would have just fired me.  So I definitely got lucky. "
"women here have to wear the abaya ( the black outfit ) but it's not always black, they have them in color's and patterns now, and not all women cover their faces. I don't cover my face. In more strict cities like Riyadh the women do cover their face with the niqab, but you just know who is who by the way they speak, their purse, their eyes ( the niqab doesn't cover the eyes ) , height, etc it's kind of obvious I guess. aha sometimes I do freak out when I don't know where my mom is but she doesn't cover her face either so I usually just panic until she finds me, call her, or try to look for her face lol 

( but I am completely against both the abaya and the niqab and forceful hijab ) "
"Even though you've never experienced sexual arousal, have you ever felt anything romantic for someone elce?"
"Oh, they noticed."
I'd turn up to random places unannounced and start handing out $100 bills to passers by 
You know who else we kill? People who know without being told. 
Awesome things. I am just over 90 days clean. Let’s keep it going!
We're here for you dude you're gonna be fine.
I am more prone to UTIs. I don't get periods.
"I don't really care, to be honest."
Found the reason why he's not Elon Musk guys
"Yeah, that is a pretty dumb way to think all right."
"My father was never charged with his crimes against me. Who's word were they going to take? When you're that young, you don't even know it's wrong. I did report him more than once. I ended up being the one to see the shrink. He did eventually serve 3 hrs for an unrelated crime. I am 52 now"
"I've had 13 in my life so far, and I'm in my early 20's."
"I actually look like an adult with an extreme babyface. I am 4'9""."
"No worries, sensitivity can't be an issue when it comes to something this serious.  To answer your question, I can't say I ever felt like life wasn't worth living.  And yes, the drugs is what kept me going every day.  Once a person is in the clutches of heroin, it is all they think about and desire and will do anything to get.  Even though I hated myself, my life, my choices, the pain I caused myself and others, I would wake up every single day wanting more heroin.  I did come to the realization that the drug life wasn't worth living.  Not to end it all, but to get out and have a better life.  It sounds corny, but hope is what kept me alive.  The glimmer of hope that one day it would be better.  I would see strangers on the streets, smiling and having fun and think, I want that too.  The same strangers that I would beg money from, lie to and say it was for food, kept me hanging on.  Their kindness stayed with me.  One particular day stands out:  I was begging for money and told a lady that my car had broken down and I couldn't afford a tow truck.  After the rest of my sob story, she handed me $50.  I remember thinking, I can buy enough heroin for the rest of the day with this.  But I also remember thinking, This is the nicest woman I've ever met.  As she drove away smiling at me, I made a promise that day that if I made it out of this chapter alive, I'll pay it forward for the rest of my life.  And I have.  When I see someone begging for money, I'll give them enough to get something to eat.  Now, I know 99% of the time they'll spend it on drugs or alcohol, but what matters is the kindness.  That woman's kindness that day helped saved my life."
What happened to your parents?
What's it like to not be Elon musk?
Why go to college when you can make more money hooking?
Birth defect.
Thank you for posting this AMA and for being so open with your responses. I don't have a question but wanted to tell you I respect you for opening yourself up to questioning and think you're brave. 
Does it look like one of those dolls that pees? Where it’s just a hole at the bottom?
Good bot.
Yes and no - when I was born they put my real bladder back in me. My body continuously rejected it for the first four years of my life causing a lot of threatening infections. When I was 5 they did a reconstructive surgery where I got my artificial bladder or resevoir and a stoma (small hole in my stomach) for self catheterizing. My urinary sphincter was replaced with surgical material similar to a rubber band causing a lot of incontinence even still at 25. The surgery was a 12-13in slice directly down the center of my abdomen ending at the entrance to my vagina. My anatomy had to be moved around for the artificial bladder to fit. My surgeon did a great job reconstructing my genitals and closing me up. My junk looks completely normal but it pretty much stops there. My anatomy is so different inside that my cervix is too low to be able to have sex comfortably or at all really. I don't think this happens to everyone especially now but back when I was having surgery everything was still experimental. I'm now looking at a follow up surgery to fix this problem 😬
You are 22. Leave now save you're 20s. Trust me you will regret staying in that. 
Lemme rephrase that: I like both girl things and guy things. Although romantic comedies do suck. Except for the Princess Bride.
"I didn’t go through an official process. My parents are still legally responsible for me, but they trust me. Aka if something went wrong it’d still be their fault."
"Yes. Like any 'new' tecnology, once many have been made the economy of scale kicks in and prices fall. Think about your DVD player 15 years ago you'd pay a pretty penny for it, now, you'd struggle to get $10 for it on craigslist/ebay and the buyer would want free delivery."
"Did you ever feel like you went through puberty? You say you don't have a period, no breasts, and no sense of sexuality. How was it being a teenager?"
Do you have the same sex drive without genitals? I feel like several key sex hormones are normally produced there right? At least in men I know that's true. 
'bout free fiddy
I have so many questions haha. Like do you have no opening? Is it just smooth skin? And what about your boobs?
Pretty much.
I synthesise molecules that are used as 'pigments' in solar cells. Essentially I make pretty colours that turn light into electricity. 
"No question, just good on you for getting off! "
I actually sound like a more high-pitched version of Meghan McCarthy.
Have you ever tried anal masturbation? 
"I kinda want kids, but at the same time I don't know if I could handle being a parent, particularly when they get to be teens, due to my not experiencing most of what comes with being a teen."
"I can't help but laugh at the misuse of neutralize over naturalize, for your sake I hope you don't get neutralized."
"Thanks mate, I really do appreciate it!"
How did you get into heroin? Glad you're clean sober! 
Did you catch her in the act?? Walk us through here.
I would imagine you to get more than just the tip in this line of work?
"Yes, I'm one of those lucky, lucky people who basically has permanent psychosis, it comes and goes a little throughout the day but basically I'm never *not* hallucinating to some extent. I think that sounds worse than the reality when I put it that way, but if I had to speculate I think I'm actually luckier that I don't have many distinct or jarring psychotic episodes. Kind of like how you only notice background noise when it stops.
Can't say for sure though, it's just always been like this for me.

I don't pay too much attention to my voices to be honest, most of the time it's like somebody talking in another room, sounds like words but you can't really pick them out. And sometimes they can be positive, or at least neutral, sometimes they even make me laugh. Which y'know, totally helps me not look like a crazy person.
But yes, they can be pretty bad, but I really try not to dwell on it too much because it can easily be overwhelming. Nobody can be as cruel to you as your own brain."
So okay next question: how does that happen?
"Of course, currently a junior in High School."
This is why you're such a terrible king. 
"Hey! I was born with the same thing! They took some intestine and other stuff to build up my bladder. They also took my appendix and it's now used to form a bridge between my stomach and bladder. I use a catheter. I guess my question is if you could have a normal bladder, would you? "
If you had the choice of being a millionaire or running your wife over - how fast would you hit her? 
Nope!
"Teach us, master! "
"Dude. I know we’re supposed to be inclusive but when I think hooker, I think young girl. Why buy a used car when I could get a newer one with less issues?"
"That was really thoughtful. When did they determine that you are a girl? Do you identify as""girly""?"
Because you’re adopted 
Fair enough. Black ck’s. They’re soft and have good support 
"The Princess Bride isn't a romantic comedy, it's an anthem, a beautiful shining beacon of hope and awesomeness is a dark world of hate and despair.
-from me a 40+ bearded guy. "
"What's bouncier, you or the tits?"
So how do you know you’re a girl?
"I envied my friends who were going on and on about how big their boobs were getting, but at the same time I didn't envy their complaints about periods, and I'm ashamed to admit that there was always at least one occasion each semester during middle/high school where I would smirk at the sight of someone experiencing a surprise period in school."
"I think the main thing was the ability to rebuild relationships.  Because without relationships, a person has nothing to turn to except drugs.  "
Did your parents have to wait to have your chromosomes tested before they named you? 
Yup!
"I personally think it's ridiculous in terms of pleasure, but I can understand the reproductive aspect of things, even if it strikes me as pointless."
"Wow, that's great that your work helped you out and worked it out with you too. "
That’s what I figured but it’s been so long I’m just gonna keep it rolling to see how long it takes someone to say something. Kind of like a social experiment lol
"Travel times is a big one, can't take the car for another year, so bus is the way to go... "
How big is your hog?
because 
Are you be more prone to UTI’s? Do you still have a monthly cycle?
I don't have a question for you but just wanted to say please stay safe
