"Have you considered bringing props with you? A foam finger and a box of popcorn, I mean. Possibly a cowboy beer helmet?"
"My nephew, as a 3 year old child, slowing picked away at his car seat foam stuffing. Only thing was every time he successfully removed a piece, he would proceed to stuff it in his nose. Fast forward to a few months after doing this repetitively, his mom, my sister, is frustrated by the sinus infections he had been getting, not to mention he had a strange smell coming from his breath and facial region. She took him to a specialist and he pulls out 8oz of car seat foam from his nose. That shit smelt and looked like death. To this day, I give him crap about it, saying things like, “What’re you gonna do, stick it up your nose and let it sit for months?!”

Edit for spelling and grammar 

Edit cause I’m not trying to hog the karma here. Sorry op."
"I only remember that I once wished to be deaf, as weird as that sounds. 

Then, a few weeks ago I took a bath, and got water stuck in my ear. Usually all it takes is a few pulls and jumps, but it didn't got out for days. 

Eventually curiosity took over and I tried to ""touch"" the water, maybe scrape it out with my finger, when I scratched something which did not belong to my body - and then I remembered how I put it there, and thought maybe I should go to a doctor. "

"Chalk it up as a win. You gutted it up by stripping, yeah, but also by asking her out. That's two cool things there.  
And she politely declined. I don't think there's humiliation in either of those. Disappointment, sure, but own it, man, don't let it own you.

"Well, when it got removed it felt like a cork being pulled out of my right ear. It suddenly got a lot louder and more clear, instantly.

Then I got very sensitive about sound. Everything was just too loud for a while. 


I also started to hear a lot of sounds which seemed like I've forgotten them, something as banal as the sound of an S. literally, sssss.

"I live in Germany and haven't been to any kind of doctor in a long time, I guess I never felt comfortable around them. 

And basically I just wanted to get that piece of plastic out, so when he asked me what my medical problem was I told him just like I wrote it in the title: ""put it in a long time, noticing it only now, please put it out!""

And he did, it took maybe 20 seconds. He asked for a few details, and he kept mentioning ""that is such a rarity"", when I left he even asked me to wait so he could tell the lady at the front desk about this ""case"", and he told me I should put it on the internet somewhere. I also have an appointment ""three months from now"", whenever that will be."
"Nope. The business isnt even operating with proper permits or licenses. I have a draft for such a contract in my inbox, however it hasn't been signed. Clients can get out of a contract in 60 days, even sooner if the company is in breach, which it is."
"Out of a random encounter. I have to walk past her room to go to the kitchen and back again. One night they came back from being out and left their door open. Maybe they thought I wasn't home, maybe they were just so into it they didn't think of closing the door behind them I don't know. Anyway I walked past her room and I took a glimpse inside and they saw me passing by and she said something to the effect of ""like what you see?"" and I said yeah it's really hot and wished them more fun. I wanted to keep walking then but again my roomie would stop me, this time by bluntly asking if I want to keep watching. I was unsure at first but eventually walked in and watched them. They told me to get comfortable and I just kind of sat back, and watched and eventually started playing with myself."
"hello. just finished my exams. my whole geology class was in the hall, waiting for our prof to come give the exam. after 20 minutes... no sign of him. a student had the phone number he distributed at the start of the semester, and called him up.

i think itll be three months from now
"So this is a difficult question and one that we grapple with ourselves quite a bit. 

We do have one identity that goes by our birth name and for a very long time we assume that she was the ""real"" identity. However, we now believe that is most likely not true. (Long, complicated, traumatic story). 

DID is caused by trauma very early in a child's identity development, so there's a very good chance that this happened so early in our development that there genuinely isn't a singular real ""me"". We may have just developed this fragmented sense of self from the very beginning. "
"I have heard other people with DID describe having a mental headspace, but this is not something we experience. We (all of us) have aphantasia, so I wonder if this is why we lack this particular experience that other people with DID have? 

I am able to communicate directly with some of them, but we don't all share that level of communication. It's something we have had to work at. 

We do not all get along. There is definitely some conflict. "

"Hi, hope you don’t mind if I answer a couple of your questions!

&gt; Do you switch personalities in the middle of interactions with people, and if so can people notice even if they aren't close friends/family/so?

Yes, they do switch in the middle of interactions, although the frequency depends on the day and other factors. I’ve known them for a very long time so I have a pretty good idea of when it happens and who I’m talking to (although I’m far from perfect at it!) Most people wouldn’t notice, or at most they might pick up on what they’d perceive as a change in mood.

&gt;Whats the age range of you all?

The youngest (Emma) is around 4, and the oldest ones are the same age as their physical age, 32. 

&gt; Are there any different physiological characteristics with personalities as well (i.e. only one is allergic to orange juice, one is athletic/coordinated..etc)

Allergies are shared between all of them, since it’s a physiological response of the body. However, they do have some different…gestures, I guess? Quin bounces his leg when he’s anxious, Hailey chews on her hair (when it’s long enough). 

&gt; Lets say you're at a job that you don't like, or some other unpleasant situation. Can you retreat internally and let a personality that likes it take over? 

Yes, absolutely. There are situations that some find more unpleasant than others, and it’s not uncommon for them to “step back” and let a different alter take care of it."

"Thank you. It was a struggle. We actually dropped out of college once and took about 3 years off before returning to finish our bachelors, so it wasn't an easy path. 

So to clarify, I was not actually the original identity who was present during our childhood. In early childhood she was only vaguely aware of us as imaginary friends or voices (internal voices, not auditory hallucinations like schizophrenics experience). In adolescence she became aware of periods of amnesia and started to experience social problems such as people accusing her of doing things she couldn't remember doing, people approaching her saying that they knew her when she couldn't remember them, etc. 

I would say that it was gradual in that we did not dissociate as often or as severely when we were younger. It's a reaction to stressful events, so it really started becoming a problem during our teens. "
I don’t know why this keeps deleted again. But they used the girls to gain info. Not really for blackmail 
"Hey thanks!! I grew up in housing for aboriginal people until I was 9 - and I just remember my Parents were always trying to fix and maintain a house that wasn’t built to last ( I only learnt this in my architecture degree ) So I used to just draw the ‘dream home’ that I thought my parents deserved. 

They have always worked so hard and have been great role models - they gave us all the opportunities they never had growing up "
"basically, i was a freshman in high school and i had a crush on this boy- it wasn't too big of a crush, but i thought he was cute, and he liked the same TV shows as i did. he was older than me and he made me feel cool because he had turned down a few other girls but he still hung out with me. i never really got the impression that he liked me back but it didn't bother me too much because i still liked him as a person. one day after school i was with him and my other friend in a lab room at my school. my friend left and me and him talked for a little bit.

all of a sudden i started feeling really dizzy and my heart was beating too fast for my chest. i felt like i had drifted out of my body. i don't remember this part too well but when i finally ""snapped back"" to reality he had me up against the wall and was forcefully kissing me. i was completely frozen, just totally removed from the situation. i'm pretty sure my eyes were open too. he pushed his hand down the front of my pants. that was the moment i realized that that was actually happening to me and i needed to react. i pushed him away and told him to stop several times, but he didn't. i don't know why, but i can't remember anything that happened after that. i know i wasn't raped, but i know he didn't stop when i told him to. afterwards, he told me not to tell anyone and then left. i got home and sat down on my bed, staring at the wall for at least 45 minutes. i was so confused- i had liked him so much, why didn't i enjoy it when he touched me? why didn't i push him away earlier? why did i feel so dirty? 
ever since that day i have not been able to feel clean. i felt like i had no control over my body at all. in a poem i wrote the year after, i said ""i feel like my body doesn't belong to me anymore. it is like a favorite shirt that he borrowed and once he gave it back i couldn't see what i ever liked about it in the first place."" 
i began restricting what i ate. i wanted to control at least one thing about myself. as i lost more and more weight, it was as if a different weight was lifted as well- i thought if i could just get down to 99 pounds i would like myself again. i would be able to look in the mirror and not be disgusted with what i saw. i thought that when i walked down the hall, everyone saw right through me- they saw what i had done, that i was a whore, a slut. i thought if i was thinner, so thin that everyone could see i was starving myself, someone would finally talk to me. someone would ask me what was wrong, would ask my why i was doing this to myself. 99 pounds came and went and no one ever asked. "
Ask them politely yet firmly to leave.
He did. He was a high rank in his academy. He knew him as a high guy to answer to
"It is nowhere near as dramatic or exciting as it is in the movies. For one thing, we don't go running to the closet for a wardrobe change or start talking in a different voice. 

But one of the diagnostic criteria for DID is the presence of 2 or more identity states that ""take control"". So yes, they do take over. We call it ""fronting"", as in they are the one out in front. When one of the other alters is fronting, the others are generally unaware of what is going on during that time. 

Since I am the one fronting right now, the other alters (identities) are unaware of what is going on and will have amnesia for this time period. "
You should also report them to the state to get them officially out of your market

Isn't that how you quote..?
"That's hardcore!! Something to be proud of!! ...maybe 


For me it was like a one-time thing, though some part of me kinda feels like my left ear got too good of a deal... 😉"
"&gt;Do you switch personalities in the middle of interactions with people, and if so can people notice even if they aren't close friends/family/so?

Yes, we do switch in the middle of interactions. People do tend to notice that something is ""off"" but they don't know what is wrong unless they already know that I have DID. Most people will just ask ""Are you okay?"" 

&gt;Whats the age range of you all?

Age 4 to our physical age (currently 32)

&gt;Are there any different physiological characteristics with personalities as well (i.e. only one is allergic to orange juice, one is athletic/coordinated..etc)?

No, not really. We're fairly prone to somatic illnesses like stress rashes, stomach aches, migraines, etc and those can vary between us but that's not that exciting. 

&gt;Are there strengths to having DID (such as releasing full potential of the brain with multiple skillsets you wouldnt have with just 1 personality) or is it more of a struggle?

Other than allowing people to survive abuse that might otherwise be soul crushing, not really. 

&gt;Do each of you talk with eachother internally? Do you ever get angry or upset with eachother and try to fight for the position of the body?

Yes, absolutely. 

&gt;Lets say you're at a job that you don't like, or some other unpleasant situation. Can you retreat internally and let a personality that likes it take over? Are new ones generated in this way?

I doubt that new identities are created that way. I think it takes something more traumatic. But we have had situations where no one will take control and we get like the psychological equivalent of hold music playing in our brain. Basically we just sit there semi-catatonic. 

&gt;What are the biggest struggles with DID?

Dealing with the periods of amnesia and trying to pretend like you know what's going on. 

&gt;Lastly I suspect my sibling may be developing something like this. His moods change very drastically, and I've noticed he will tell me things and then later the same day even it will be a complete 180 on what he said previously and he acts as if he never said the first thing. He has told me it feels like some other energy takes over him (he said its much like a demon). Are these possible signs?

Possibly? But there are dozens of other things that could be. Unless your sibling experienced severe abuse in early childhood, I would not suspect DID. Either way, definitely seek help. Those symptoms sound distressing. "

"We do not share the same feelings for people. We all have different ways of viewing and interacting with the world around us, and that includes the people in it.

I think we all consider our friend  /u/__haunted a good friend too. But she's had some experience in dealing with some alters who were initially not so friendly. "

This is a legit question.  Please answer. 
"Would you consider yourself to have one personality that contains the ""real you""? Or do you consider all personalities to be equally valid? If you consider your own personality the ""core identity"", would your alters agree?

"Quin is the one running this AMA. The other alters are Arlo, Caden, Carrie, Hannah, Morgan, Storm, Zoe, Hailey, and Emma."
"He said besides getting out of the tail and opening envelopes he was assigned to recrute German prostitutes to send them to the high rank in Berlin 
Edit: prostitutes "
"We don't stress about it too much. We're fairly gender-nonconforming in general. Honestly, it used to be a lot harder when we were younger, but we live in a pretty liberal area now and there are lots of trans and genderqueer people here so it's a lot easier to dress in gender non-conforming ways and just be at ease. Occasionally we deal with some dysphoria but it's manageable. "

Like: boom! both she and I were non smokers. No side effects, no withdrawals. It is possible folks!"
"Congratulations on doing so well academically despite having to deal with DID! How did become aware of it? Was the dissociation gradual, beginning with symptoms of bipolar/schizophrenia, or did another personality/ies just emerge without other stuff?"

"There was certainly some trauma, but I won't go into the details in this AMA. 

We have a few assholes in the group. Things have settled down a bit now that we're older. Everyone understands that there are consequences to our actions and that everyone in the group has to suffer those consequences, regardless of who performed the action. I think peer pressure keeps most of the group in line. 

I think I am probably the dominant personality. Most of the group would probably agree. I'm probably here about 80% of the time these days, I think? "
"I very rarely use ""we"" except in a handful of specific circumstances, and only when I am talking to someone who knows I have DID. I use ""we"" when:

* I am talking about something that impacts the whole ""system""

* I can't remember exactly who was fronting (in control) when a past event happened 

* I'm being intentionally vague

For the most part, I talk about myself singularly. I experience my sense of self and identity in the singular. 

Our original/core/host/whatever rarely fronts anymore. It's a long story. She kind of burnt out, I guess? Things are better now that I'm in control. 

Switching happens pretty frequently. A few times a day, at least. 

I have my own name, but I answer to our legal/birth name because it's easier and most people do not know that I have DID. "
[deleted]
"Some muscle memory definitely carries over. Everybody knows how to type. Initially Hailey (who is emotionally about 8) insisted that she couldn't text, but the muscle memory for it is there and given enough motivation to want to communicate with people she can do it. 

It seems like muscle memory translates well across all alters, but things that require focus and attention do not. "
"Thank you, that's the idea. There are a few employees that stand to lose their jobs that need the income, so I'm not going to act on that aspect of my plan until I have another paycheck waiting for them"
It hasn't been brought up. But if they'd ever offer it I'd most likely accept the offer.
"&gt;  I was not actually the original identity who was present during our childhood. In early childhood she was only vaguely aware of us as imaginary friends or voices

What happened to the original identity?"
"It's not inappropriate at all, I welcome the discussion. :) 

&gt; How do you recognize which personality is fronting? Do you approach different personalities differently?

It can be tricky. I don’t like to outright ask who I’m talking to but I do like to know, so I try to look for different “tells” that let me know who it is. Their writing styles range from being slightly different to *radically* different; Quin, Hannah, and Zoe are very similar, but the younger ones are pretty easy to pick out because they’re not a fan of capitalization or punctuation, haha. But differentiating between Quin and Zoe is more about picking up on their tone and how they respond to certain things. 

I do approach different alters a bit differently, but I try to be friendly and welcoming no matter what. But, for example, Arlo tends to get confused by jokes, while Caden is a joke-cracking machine. 

&gt; And lastly, are there situations where your actions might please one personality but hurt another, but you are not aware which personality is currently fronting? How do you deal with such situations, if they ever arise?

Hmm. This is a good question. There are certainly things I could do that would annoy or even upset one alter and not faze another, but I can’t think of any time when that’s happened. I usually try to make 100% sure who I’m talking to before engaging in any conversations that might be distressing to one of them. For example, once upon a time there were some alters who found talking about dissociation quite upsetting, but Quin liked to talk about it, so I would just make sure I was talking to Quin before broaching the subject. 

Thanks for your questions!"
"Yes. We work very hard at having good internal communication and being able to talk to each other. I know it sounds silly, but it's essentially just thinking at each other. In the early days, before we were good at communicating with each other, we used journals and notes to each other to communicate. "
Someone took a shit on my dad's computer 
This was not a part of the questions but I will ask him right now. I want to know as well besides the bunker I should hide at. 
Do you ever join in?
"I wrote a little bit about each of them, because every time this gets asked in an AMA, they dodge the question. It did take a while! 


Caden is a little ball of sunshine. When he’s around, he’s being silly and cracking jokes left and right. He’s also a vegetarian and has a sweet tooth. 

Zoe is passionate. She can be more outwardly emotional and volatile, and she’s not afraid to speak her mind, but she’s very caring. She likes to write, although I’ve never been allowed to read any of her work. 

Arlo is the one who steps in when there’s just too much going on and they know that what they really need is a blanket, a drink, and a snack to calm down. They talk quite frankly, usually about a game or some other interest, and only stick around on the front line for a little bit. They used to play Tetris quite a bit.

Hannah is a caretaker of the bunch. She looks out for the young ones and has a very warm and protective heart. When she’s around she tends to clean or bake.

Storm is…Storm. Haha there’s really no single word that sums her up. She tends to show up like her name implies, angry and the like, but once that passes, she’s quite sensitive and kind. Once upon a time she wrote poetry, but I don’t think she does anymore. 

Carrie I’ve only talked to once or twice. I gather that she doesn’t typically spend time online and is one of the more social ones. 

Hailey is easily frightened and very sensitive. She’s only started texting somewhat recently, so we haven’t really talked much. She likes to watch videos on YouTube and color.

Emma is the youngest and she doesn’t text with words very often (usually just “yes” and “no.”) We usually communicate using pictures and gifs. She also likes to watch YouTube, color, and play with toys. 

Quin is…well, he’s the one running this AMA, so you already know he’s very intelligent and articulate. He takes care of everything and tries to make sure things go as smoothly as possible for all of them."

Now to the point: I cannot help but to notice the writing style. Is it common for you to address yourself/yourselves as 'we'?
You mentioned, that you weren't the original identity. What happened with that one?
Do you 'switch'? Or the change is gradual to the point where it's virtually permanent (or till next one emerges)? Do you go by same name?
I hope none of my questions is too personal. Looking forward to your answer!

Fast forward a couple of weeks, he returns to the doctor begging him to put it back in so he doesn't have to listen to his wife's nagging.  "

"Well, to give you an example, I've always been rather close to Quin. Some of the other alters weren't initially a fan of this...they were suspicious that I might ""out"" them, or in some cases they were a bit jealous of our friendship. It took some time to earn their trust, and convince them that I like talking to all of them, but now I think I'm on good terms with almost all of them."
"Do you switch personalities in the middle of interactions with people, and if so can people notice even if they aren't close friends/family/so?

Lets say you're at a job that you don't like, or some other unpleasant situation.  Can you retreat internally and let a personality that likes it take over?  Are new ones generated in this way?

He has told me it feels like some other energy takes over him (he said its much like a demon).  Are these possible signs?

Sorry for so many questions.  I'm genuinely curious about this condition, and firmly believe it exists though many people do not.  I've listened to a professor talk to me of her husband with DID but it was very brief.  I also have an acquaintance with it (I only know because she told me, but I know she wasn't lying). Unfortunately she moved away and we only text maybe once a month, so I was never really able to get information from her or experience being close with someone with DID.  

Thanks in advance

"Hey, just wanted to pop in about this. While being investigated for vascular type myself, I was pretty down about the lethality/potential lifespan stuff. My mom, who is a nurse, when I told her I'd probably not live to her age, replied ""I've seen a lot of people live and die, and we all have a set amount of time on this Earth. Some people don't have as much time as others, and that's just normal. But the number of years doesn't diminish the quality of life-- you can have some people who make it to 30 and cram a lot of living into those years and others who make it to 90 with poor quality of life and a lot of regrets. Most folks don't know how much time they have, so what's important is just living well with what you've got.""

For me, who was panicking and just generally feeling awful, it was really powerful for me to hear her kind of flippant response. ""Oh, yeah, that's normal, that just happens sometimes. Here's some advice."" Wishing you well!"

"This is going to sound ridiculous, but we essentially ""think"" at each other. I don't know how else to describe it. If we are completely alone, we talk out loud. 

If we really need things to be concrete, we write things down in a journal or use notes like Google Keep. "
"Yeah. Someone is definitely going to be upset. Sharing this much private information is definitely against ""the rules"" but a lot of things are against ""the rules"". "
"Lol, you little shit made me laugh more than i am willing to admit"
"Even if you didn't sign it it may be valid. If they sent you the contract and you continued working for them, it could be seen as an implied acceptance of the contract. It's not as strong as a signed contract, but you're not necessarily free and clear.

You should definitely report them to the appropriate authority for their lack of permits and licenses. Also if you have good documentation on the minimum wage issue, you should report that too."
"Yesterday she told me, she loves my roll chair because she can get around the room easily. I think she just can't sleep on my crappy mattress and so she's doing that. "
"She said she ""almost felt bad for me"" as I was bawling on the floor"
They were very excited for me - leaving our home town was a massive step towards a better life. They told me to make sure I never come back! 
"I actually like this question. 

I have changed my name so many times, but I honestly don't remember where I got any of them. 

Storm used to go by Raven, which she got from one of those ""Teen Witch"" Wicca books when we were like 11. We teased her about it so much she changed her name to Storm. Now we won't stop teasing her about being named Storm, so she's thinking about changing it again. 

Caden chose his name right at the beginning of the Caden/Jaden/Braden/Aiden trend, before that whole thing had really exploded. He's regretting it now. 

Carrie named herself after a friend who was named Carrie (and just maybe because she really likes the Care Bears). 

Zoe named herself after a character in a children's book. None of us can remember the name of the book, but it was about a girl who made friends with another little girl only to find out that the girl was actually a ghost. The ghost girl was named Zoe. 

Hailey... I have no idea where Hailey's name comes from. She used to spell it ""Haylie"" and tell people ""I'm a lie"". We made her change it. It was fucked up. 

I'm not sure why Emma is Emma, but we sometimes call her ""Em"", and ""M"" is the first letter of our birth name, so I think that might be related? Not sure. 

Arlo is a mystery. Arlo insisted on having no name for a while, and then randomly declared themselves Arlo. We had no idea why until we were at Costco and saw some security cameras called Arlo security cameras. And then we were like ""Did you name yourself after a fucking security system? What the fuck?"" That seems like something Arlo would do. 

I'm not sure where Hannah's name came from, but if I had to guess, I'd guess that she chose it because it rhymes with Banana. "
"Of all your personalities (from reading your comments I assume 3-4?)  are some of them better at certain muscle memory things than others? 

I play guitar and find I often zone out and leave it up to muscle memory to play certain songs, and i'm very curious about your potential experience with that. :)"
"We all adopted our own names when we became aware of ourselves as separate from the identity that goes by our birth name. I guess the stream of thought kind of goes like ""I'm not her. Well, if I'm not her, then who am I? I'm somebody... If I'm somebody then I guess I should have a name."" 

We either picked out our own names or someone picked out a name for us. A few of us have changed our names a couple of times. I've gone by Quin, Sebastian, Justin, JT, Jonathan, Jon and then back to Quin. Identity is a funny thing for us. "
"Serious question about dating. Do each of your personalities individually date people, ie you only go out with person A when a particular personality is fronting? Can your personalities cheat on you if the wrong personality showed up at an inopportune time? "
I've personally forged relationships with the business managers and owners at the locations we clean and the company I work for is in breach of their contract 
"Normal? 

The instance he pulled it out it was different. Like, milliseconds. I remember a distinct ""cracking"" sound as it got out.

Since then it's very different. I can't call it Normal yet."
"It was pretty easy cuase the state was already trying to take us away from our mom

I see her as a mother figure but she will always be my big sister

I dont know "
"Yes her boyfriend helped me buy her a gift 

I got her 30 dollar gift card to her fav nail solan"
"I could very easily get completely derailed on an entire discussion about the controversies of DID and spend all day on that alone. 

I was actually really lucky to go to a college where I had two professors with opposing views. One was a social psychologist who believed that DID was iatrogenic. The other was a trauma specialist who believed that DID was a valid traumagenic disorder. I was taught both perspectives. I was actually already diagnosed at that point so while it was a little difficult to be confronted with that skepticism, it did help me later when I was faced with skepticism from other people. "
"This is one of those questions that probably depends completely on the person with DID. Everyone is going to deal with this how they want to deal with this. 

For us, we're already pretty hesitant to get into any kind of intimate or romantic relationship with anybody so it hasn't really been an issue. We wouldn't want to do something like that. "
"The strangest client I ever had wasn't really mine, he was the regular of a friend of mine. She was someone that had stopped taking new clients, and in my opinion was a little too focused on keeping her hand full of regulars.

So one of her regulars was into incredibly detailed, tedious roleplay, that neither of us really understood, but was obviously based on incidents from his own life.
 
Physically it wasn't demanding, because he never wanted to have sex with us, he'd just masturbate on one or both of us.

It usually consisted of us acting very authoritive, dressed like a policewoman, or soldier or something then stripping off and acting like a simpering school girl (all the time pretending he wasn't in the room) then getting dressed again, acting out some scene, and then pretending not to notice him wanking on us.

In the five years I did sex work that was the strangest, as in I found it the hardest to understand. "
So what events lead her to gaining custody? Like what happened with your mom and you guys?
"We all have terrible handwriting, so sort of?"
"I had tried quitting a few times before and failed miserably. I had cravings, had to rely on my (ultimately failing) will power, and eventually just continued smoking.

But this time it just... went away. No cravings, no need for will power. I could eat a full meal, drink a coffee, drink alcohol, drive in my car (not after drinking, obviously), have an argument, watch other people smoke and not think about smoking myself. 

I hope by telling other smokers that's it's possible, that maybe it'll happen for them too. It'll click for them like it did for me."
"What's your favorite type of cheese?

Also, massive congrats for kicking it. "
Is this an ad?
Good lad. Your sister is raising you well.
"I think it's unfortunate that so many young psych students are still being presented with such a limited perspective. I feel very lucky to have had a professor had specialized in trauma and dissociation. I'm not here to debate DID with anyone, but I will point to the inclusion of DID in the DSM-5. I think that if DID were as controversial as your professors would have you believe, it would have been removed from the DSM on the latest revision. "
How do relationships work? Do you and your alters share the same feeling for a specific person or does it differ per alter? 
"So we actually do not drive for that exact reason. It would be unsafe. 

DID and PTSD are actually very similar. Everyone with DID has different triggers and they are specific to the trauma that you experienced. But yeah, we've been in traffic (as a passenger) and switched and started screaming at other cars. 

Relationships of all kind can be really hard. We do connect differently sometimes. I think  /u/__haunted can speak to this better than I can, actually. "

"I remember watching the United States of Tara a while ago and the Psychology professor character alluded to himself not believing the disorder was real. That always stood out to me, and always I wondered why there is doubt in the professional/academic realm. How are the professionals ""rationalizing"" the condition?  Why do you think there's ambiguity or an inability for consensus?

I honestly hope this doesn't sound offensive in any way. Your commentary would be very unique as you're actually  in academia and  diagnosed with the condition. Thanks."
"Damn, I wish. If I try real hard I can make my eyes look two different directions, I think. Does that count?"
"Happened to me too. I showed up the next day, door was closed, thought ok, maybe professor is late. I saw some classmates and just chilled with them, turns out they were there to take another final for another course they had.

This gets worse as I start to panic when they asked how I did, I realize the final was yesterday. I panic and start to contact the professor via email and contacting his office at the other campus he teaches.

I google his name and soon find his resume with address, home phone, and cell phone. I contact his cell and he immediately sends an email to please lose his cell number and not call again.

I was forced to retake the course the next quarter, I ended up passing with an A and he claims I cheated. I purposedly sat at front and he still claims I cheated, I told him I had gotten B's and A's last quarter on the quizzes and midterms, still claims I cheated. He threatened to fail me and tell the chair, little did he know I knew the chair of my department. I got a C and he is no longer employed by the campus. Soooooooo, sometimes, well, sometimes missing a final isnt so bad."
Hahaha. Stop trying to be offended. I gotta remember to use that one.
"Do you wish you did, or they wont allow?"
"It would take a long time to list that out for everyone, but maybe we'll do that some time? 

Emma can read, surprisingly. 

Our family is the source of our trauma and unfortunately we do still have a relationship with them because some of us won't accept that and continue to engage with them anyway, which is a constant source of distress. They are not supportive. They are horrible. "
What did the professor say?
"Still trying to figure that out myself honestly, in between weird emotions, anxiety, depression, and schoolwork it sometimes feels like there's no point.
I guess the thing that really keeps me going is the thought of being able to move out and make things better in a year."
"Because TV and movie portrayals of DID (like Split) make DID look like something absolutely terrifying or mystical, and the reality is that people with DID can live pretty normal lives. "
