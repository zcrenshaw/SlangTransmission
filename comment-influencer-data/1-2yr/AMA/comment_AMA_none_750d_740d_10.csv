"The light...and darkness...was very eerie. It wasn't like Twilight. Different entirely.

I thought the sky would be very dark during totality work lots of stars.  It was really just a very deep blue AMD the brightest stars peeked out. 

Got chilly. 

It was breathtaking.   Over too fast.  "
"Hey, i'm assuming you're a Harry Potter fan from your name? Sevy? Am I write? I use a screen reader. It is a program that allows me to use my laptop. I use shortcuts. Some are windows bassed and others are related to the screen reader. The screen reader reads out what I type and what I'm arrowing over in synthetic speech. I could, if I ordered one online plug in a braille display to my computer and use that too. I learnt to type at a very young age in school. The screen reader I use is called NVDA. You can find out more here. www.nvaccess.org"
"No, I did not vote for Trump. And sadly yes, he did live up to my expectations of him."
I don't have a question for you. Just reaching out to wish you well. 
"I never thought i'd say this but have you considered trying meth? 
"
Why? He knows nothing. 
"I'd say the gratest challenge is socialising, but that's just me. Not every blind person is the same as I'm sure you know. As for an upside, I'd not really know as I've been this way all my life. Although If I had to pick a nice thing i'd choos getting guided by women, that's nice. :)"
how are you reading this?
"Well, advice number one: stop doing drugs. If you're up for positions that drug test, don't do drugs, at least until after you've been hired. Also, if you're without a job and income, that drug money is money you could be spending on more important things, like food and student loans. "
"I got fired a week ago from a job I had for four years. It was an embarrassing situation. I'm at a pretty low point as I'm still under a significant amount of student loan and credit card debt. I live with my parents who are divorcing (not peacefully) and will need to find a new place soon. I don't drive. I have no friends and have never had a relationship at the age of 31.   I'm feeling more losery than usual. I have interviewed for a great  job that pays real adult money but I totally garbled the interview and would not pass a drug test even if by some miracle I got the job. Im surprised I don't feel more depressed than I do. Its not a happy situation. Anyway, I'm lost and confused and terrified and angry at myself for the total ineptitude I've shown in running my own life. Any advice?"
"I do hold a bit of reverence for the Confederacy as much as any Southerner might. The Confederacy stood for a lot of bad things, but those who fought for the Confederacy did so for countless, and for some maybe not so nefarious, reasons. I understand that some fought to uphold the institution of slavery, some fought for state's rights, but others fought because it was their social obligation to do so. 
Many in South Louisiana, miles away from the nearest plantation, likely fought for the latter. I 
guess I 'support' those folks. 

As for why I would name my son Robert E. Lee, I named him after my dad. "
"Thank you, u/WhyNotWhine. I don't know you, and I haven't even stalked your reddit info (not yet, at least). But this is beautiful, which tells me you are probably beautiful too and I am pretty sure I love you.

No question. Just thanks."
Well played OP. Well played.
"Totality itself was otherworldly, but in many ways the environmental changes were just as interesting.  I took this video of the landscape going from light to dark. https://instagram.com/p/BYELogjAEI9/   In the minutes before totality cicadas started to chirp and lots of birds started to fly around low to the ground.  I also saw the so/called shadow bands but they didn't come out on camera.   "
"""Then they came for meâ€”and there was no one left to speak for me."""
"First of all I need to point out that my methods aren't considered healthy by most. However, my doctor was surprised by my drastic weight loss and found nothing unhealthy about me.

- Intermittent fasting - fast for 16 hours with a 8 hour eating window (YouTube it, health experts on YouTube explain it in full)

- Cardio every morning on an empty stomach. It's very important to do it on an empty stomach as your body will burn your fatty acids.

- Worked out 2x a day - before and after work. All I did was play basketball and lift weights. If there was nobody at the basketball court to play with/against, I would dribble up and down the court.

- Diet, obviously. I cut out sugar completely. Reduced my calorie intake drastically. Lots of days I consumed less calories than I should.

- Drank a kale smoothie every single day. Simple recipe: Kale and/or spinach, coconut water and a banana. 

- Drank green tea every night before bed.

- Supplements: No weight loss pills or any of that horse shit. Only protein shakes, vitamin pills, fish oil and amino acids.

- Download MyFitnessPal - this app is a game changer. I tracked everything I ate. No joke, even crumbs.

Will add more to this list if I remember anything else. Again, people say this this healthy but as a fat fuck,  the hell did I care. I was VERY serious and strict about all of this. Hope this helps you. "
"Valve doesn't care and there won't be any AMA. But I'm finally not mad. I'm happy we got a tiny piece of the closure we deserved as the fanbase that Valve wouldn't exist without. We can say goodbye to Freeman now. Seriously, the situation we were put in for so many years - a total lack of respect and a big middle finger that we can, at last, return and move on."
"Be careful with that mentality. Some of the worst human beings in recent history (Hitler, Mao Zedong, Stalin) brought improvements and prosperity to their nation's for some time but at the cost of millions of human lives. No one has the right to take another human's life, not even the leader of a Nation. The only proper action is to condemn this violence and show absolutely no support for the murderer in charge. He is not doing good, he is ending lives. "
"I noticed birds grouping like they do at the end of the day. More than anything I noticed a real calmness to everything. Also, it was a lot cooler outside. Though brief, today was worth the build up imo"
"More along the lines of couldn't afford to really leave and drive far enough away to camp safely. Our money went to getting my mother, senile grandfather, and grandmother with Alzheimer's out of harms way. My brother and I made the decision to stay. My father is one of the most loving and giving human beings I know, so your assuming self can fuck right off. :)"
Go to the store and purchase more.  Short and sweet!
"No, a degree in communication actually, how about you? Do you plan on being a stereotypical jerk for the rest of your life?"
"Cannot thank you enough. We are Texans, I believe we will persevere. "
"I have to be honest, yes there is and less crime too. I felt safer for quite a while but lately people at my age are starting to get executed that is what I'm afraid of. "
/u/GabeNewellBellevue please talk to us
I am out of milk.
"What were your feelings at Appomattox? 

Any plans to sue the federal government for turning your home into Arlington cemetery?"
That sucks so bad bro
Just got back from store. Now have milk.
"Not to be a jerk, but do you consider what kind of a burden you are on your loved ones?  Because you are unwilling to eat a healthy diet and lose the weight, your family suffers right along side you.

Losing weight and being healthy isn't some unattainable, magical secret.  Fruits, vegetables, lean protein.. And less calories going in than going out.  You CAN change and fix your health, but YOU have to be willing to put forth the effort.  Please PM me if you have any questions or need some motivation.  "
"Is there any end in sight? Like does the government give updates or reports such as ""we now believe we have killed 70% of those involved in narcotic sales"" or ""we hope to have this problem taken care of by this time next year"" or is it just no end in sight? "
"Sorry, wrong Robert E. Lee.
I've never visited Appomattox, and I'm living comfortably in my home now. "
"I was around people with dogs. The dogs' tails went between their legs afterwards and they tensed up as if to say ""WTF!?""

Also, cicadas went off and on over the 20 minutes before. There were crescent Moon shapes on the ground near trees. The darkness was surreal. It wasn't like night or twilight like you'd think - more like a subtle color desaturation as in an old 8mm home movie. The actual eclipse darkness was unlike anything else in my experience really. You could see a couple of stars, but it wasn't dark like night exactly. The sky, accented by a ring of solar corona, was just wrong. It's not that profound visually tbh, but it's neat knowing that a massive celestial event is happening at a scale larger than life, and you're just incidentally caught in the alignment."
Can't speak for OP but if he is from Houston the city is virtually impossible to evacuate. Last time the city was evacuated in 2005 more people died in the traffic than in the storm 
"Absolutely! When I was younger I was proud of the flag. However, as I grew older I saw the flag being taken over by the white nationalists and the rednecks alike. This makes me pretty sick. So much so that I don't own a Confederate flag of any kind to this day. "
"Are any of you called Bob, Robby, Rob or are you all ""Robert""?"
"My dad goes by Bob, I go by Robert (formerly ""Robby""), and my son goes by Tre'. 
We actually have two other Roberts in the close family as well as a Bobby. So, family get togethers can be quite interesting. "
Alcide. It's a fairly common Cajun French name.
"The government doesn't admit it but the order of the President to his police men ""shoot to kill"" if the suspect would resist or fight back upon arrest but most cases it has been a common excuse for the police men to say that the suspect fought back that's why they had to shoot the suspect down."
"If your real name is Sevy then I apologise. I thought it was a play on the name Severus or sevvy, or Sev, see? As for hobbies. I go out with my friend Amin who is also blind like me. We go to restaurants mostly although we have explored covent garden a little. I read, meditate, listen to audiobooks, listen to walkthroughs on youtube, listen to youtube videos about other things, go to the shops with my nan, (although I'd not call that a hobby as such, mor like a thing that must be done.)"
"We are as safe as we can be. Our plan now is to just wait until daylight comes (roughly an hour) and try and asses the situation more.

Edit: boats don't start running for rescue until 6 am"
Thank you!  Thank you for taking the time out of your day to post this!!!
"No. I could ""see"" them in my head if that makes sense. Kinda like daydreaming, sort of. I can remember all if it vividly like I did then still. I learned about rape and sort of knew what murder was, and absolutely had not ever heard the word ""Satan"" before, which I learned the very first day I met Faye yeager in Atlanta Georgia. I was forced to say my dad raped my mom in front of me multiple times after he and the other occult members drugged her then they took turns. My mom said "" oh that's probably why I had all those bruises"", and was playing into it. That fucked me up, imagining that and her saying that. She was just probably anemic"
"That depends. If it's from a college inviting 'Robert' to apply or to visit their campus, my son opens it. For just about anything else, I open it. 
It used to be a lot easier to determine who opens what. But, now that he has a job and a few dollars to his name, he is beginning to get more mail addressed to him."
"Also, if you are in an addictive relationship with drugs or alcohol, if you feel like you can't quit or can't control your use, recovery help from substance use disorder is available. And recovery is possible. I am 22 months sober."
"When your household gets a letter addressed to Robert E Lee, who opens it?"
Can you see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
"I'll get back to you on that, because the only help we have received in the past 24 hours have been from friends or boaters associated with the Cajun Navy."
"There was no way to know this would happen. We evacuated from our home to a friends house on the other side of town. This area hasn't seen flood water is 50 years. 
We have plenty of water and food to last and we should be out of here by today or tomorrow."
He's the reason why these killings are happening. He encourages it and legalizes it. What makes you like him still?
I've been in a mental hospital twice now after attemping to take my life. I just wanted say thank you for your work it honestly really helped me. 
"Girls can be bros too dont be sexist, man."
"That looks to be really good software. My wife has something similar as she's dyslexic but it's nowhere near the quality yours has.

New question: What are your hobby's? I would guess that the options are limited?

PS; I am a harry potter fan but I have no clue how my name, Sevy, gave that up?"
"Hey join us over on /r/stopdrinking!

We're friendly, and I think you'll find a lot in common with many subscribers over there. It's a huge help.

Stay strong!"
Who chooses and buys your food?
What's the greatest challenge and the greatest upside to. being blind? 
"It isn't working. It's been out since 4 am. 
And not here, lol. We have too many guns per person."
"While these are all criticisms that surely deserve to be levelled at him, I don't think r/AMA should be used as passive-aggressive Twitter."
You're assuming only the guilty are killed.
"I was in shortly after Vietnam ended.  Black clap was a story used to scare new guys.  Sort of a joke.  They told them there was this strain of clap that was so bad, the only thing the doctors could do to your junk was smash it with a hammer to get rid of it. Other stories were that your junk would turn black, and there was no cure for it, so they'd ship you off to an island like a leper colony, and you stayed there until you died. Remember, we're talking about 18 and 19 year old kids who in many cases hadn't ever left their little towns before, were terrified, and were gullible.  Not doing an AMA though because I only know of it anecdotally."
Reenactments aren't racist.
Man fried chicken is the shit
"I can't let anyone in, because I'm afraid they'd find me shallow and unintelligent, among other things. I know I'm projecting my own thoughts of self-criticism, and that people probably wouldn't think that way if I did open up to them. I also know why I have such little confidence in myself, but I don't know what to do with that knowledge."
"Yes, and more so lately.
Some white people assume that I harbor racist views and will start sharing theirs with me, which is just as uncomfortable as it sounds. And I'm sure some black or brown people treat me differently because of my name. But, by and large, people make a comment or a joke and move on."
I think i've tried them. Here in the UK we call them Cinnamon grahams. I've tried them and I do like them.
"Honest question that ive been thinking about. Do you think Houston will be able to rebound from this fully? The 2020 census is just around the corner. Do you believe that Houston will still be the 4th largest city in the country or will it slip down? New Orleans still isn't back to pre-Katrina population. 

I hope you, your family, your neighbors, and everyone else in Houston stays safe and makes it through this terrible flood. Good luck and keep us updated on your situation. I hope you get out of there soon. "
Honestly I like the President and I voted for him but these killings make me feel unsafe
Except El paso. Fuck that place. 
"No, I don't hate any group of people."
"No, that's very stereotypical of you, thank you. But I am considering working abroad but not as a maid because I'm gonna have a degree next year and I'm planning to take my Masters degree right away "
"&gt;most cases it has been a common excuse for the police men to say that the suspect fought back that's why they had to shoot the suspect down

aww, just like in America. "
that's quite the reach you've got there...
"I'd like to start this by saying that I cannot speak for all blind people. I can only speak for myself. For me, no, it does not matter in the slightest. As a matter of fact, I prefer a chubby/fat woman with a soft belly to a skinny woman. Having said that as I said before, it's personality first. I don't really have boxes that women or I need to tick to be happy. I'd like her to have a chubby belly and to be smarter than me or at least to be able to debate me but if that doesn't happpen and we end up clicking in other ways, so me it."
"Oh man first off I'd like to tell you I'm sorry this happened to you.  I was in a very similar position at one point.  One thing I have to point out to you is you seem like an extremely caring and good individual.  Now unfortunately I am going to tell you something your not going to want to hear.  Let her go.  Your best chance at getting her back is to let her go.  If this doesn't work I can guarantee you that another love will come along.  But you have to let go brother.    I've been in the same situation, and I definitely did not let go.  It took years of my life from me.  What could have been good years.  I completely understand how difficult this is, but I absolutely wouldn't be surprised if she comes running back once she's seen you've rebounded.  

So my advice is to get back on the market yourself.  Although it's counterintuitive, this is the best path.

Talking to someone definitely helps in this situation.  Feel free to message me any time you need to vent to a neutral stranger.  I'll always try to help."
"Sorry, I need to hang on to some level of anonymity here. "
Well that's anti-climactic 
"At 800 pounds almost any diet would yield weight loss. You literally must be eating nearly 10000 calories a day if not more. It's not that the diets don't work, it's that they aren't being followed."
"Cant you just ask people to start feeding you a standard 2000 calories per day of something healthy? Do they just buy you any food you want knowing is it the cause of your condition? Do you ever ask them to put you on a diet? I guess I just dont understand. 
I feel bad for you though, best of luck."
"Bro, your heart is in the right place,  but now is not that time to be thinking of this guys peen. That comes later. "
No we weren't. Being shamed into opening his doors after pretending that the church was flooded doesn't absolve him at all in my book.
Right off the bat I can tell you that you are intelligent.  I read your post.  Your sharpe.  I cannot speak on shallowness.  We both know that's easily correctable.  You cannot spend your entire life worrying how others will perceive you.  Use your intelligence to realize that there is not 1 perfect human being on this planet.  I'm interested to know why your low on self confidence because you are smart.  You have at least one great quality.  Pm me for private help on the confidence issues.
/r/shittyama
"Nope. That's not a thing I personally do. Other blind people may do it but I don't. Well if I was close with a girl then I may do it but apart from that, I don't do that."

"On a lighter note, it is scaring off tourists. I *love* The Philippines! I have been to about 20 of the 7000 islands there but won't go back until your president is out of office. 

Stay safe! "
"&gt; Although If I had to pick a nice thing i'd choos getting guided by women, that's nice. :)

Quote of the century, right there. We can shut down the internet now. Everyone go home."
"No problem and to anser your question, I do get a picture in my head of my bed. Mostly because I spend most of the time on it. :) Other people and things that are outside of my room, not so much. I think because i've been in my room most of my life, I can picture it. OH I do get out but I spend a littel more time in my room than I do out of it."
and there was much rejoicing.
Are you a confederate supporter? If not why did you name your son after their general? Do you know why your grandfather named your father after the general?
"Sure. Playing video games. I can play fighting one on one games but haven't played a games console in years. I like listening to walkthroughs and find them to be good enough for me. I'd like to socialise alot more, i'm working on that."
"I wouldn't know. I've not had a fully sexual experience yet. I'd assume it would be the same as a sighted person having sex but instead of focusing on the visual aspects of sex, I'd focus on touch, smell and sounds."
We left our own home and came to a friends on the other side of town. This house has seen 5 hurricanes and never taken water. This was something none of us could have imagined. 
"Have you ""felt"" any actual decrease in drug dealing? Do you think the county's drug related issues are starting to get solved? I'm reffering to things you experienced first hand, not what you've seen on the news     "
You should get a 1969 Dodge Charger. ;)
"Of course it's not worth it, but of course you should do it anyway. I feel no sense of gratitude, I'm resentful and bitter at our government and the people of this country for not valuing education enough to address the tuition expense crisis. By any measure, college was inaccessible to me. I found a way somehow, but it's sucked, the entire time. It's been really hard trying to pull that all off from the lower tax brackets. "
"Son, the devil is speaking through you!"
idk probly kill myself
"The police don't have to prove the tourist was a drug courier. They just have to say they were. In my eyes, that makes it too dangerous. "
"It's called ""ageing out.""  I doubt there was anything your spouse could have done differently."

Are y'all safe? Waiting for rescue?
"We never got an evacuation warning in this side of town, voluntary or mandatory. We took on 5 foot of water from 1 am to 4 am."
Why didn't you leave prior to the storm making landfall?
"My girlfriend of almost 4 years broke up with me because she was leaving to school in Philadelphia and didn't want to have a serious relationship over the phone. She said she just wanted to wait till we had time to be around each other and that she needed to focus on school. 2 weeks later she gets feelings for a guy who she had feelings for the entirety and before our relationship but woukdnjust ignore them when she was with me. She didn't even want anything out of it I guess she was just trying to get it out there. He turned her down and she recovered but now we just argue. She says she doesn't see a future in us anymore. She still cares about me is what one of our mutual friends tells me, but that she wants her space and that me trying to communicate with her is something I should stop doing. She's the love of my life and I can't even handle not talking to her for a couple of days. For the past couple of weeks my life has just been numb and my emotions are out of control. I don't know what to do but school is going to start again. I don't know how to convince myself to not feel anything the way she has done to herself about me. "
"Yes absolutely. Growing up in the South, I/we get by pretty easily with this name. But, I've also lived in Illinois, Virginia and Hawaii. 
Living in Illinois was the first time I realized that some people might react pretty negatively to my name. I was asked time and again what my parents were thinking when they named me that. This came as quite a shock to a younger me. 
In Virginia, I was back in familiar territory and was probably complemented on my name more there than in my home state of Louisiana. 
In Hawaii, I found that not may people were even aware of who Robert E. Lee was or that my name was in any way special. "
"UPDATE : I slept in a parc, wasn't that bad lol, still fucking lost"

"I consider it an honour to work where I work and who I work with. The people I work with have lost family and friends due to their illness. My colleagues and I work with and continue to serve and care in the face of their illness. 

I use the term 'work with' for residents, which is very disjointed. Ireality residents do all the work. We just provide the understanding and acceptance. 


Thank you for your compliment. "
