"I was a senior in high school, searching for colleges, when Trump was elected. I had been considering applying to the University of British Columbia but was on the fence about it. The election pushed me to apply. I was accepted and decided to attend. I think it's the best decision I've made in my life. Not sure whether or not I'll be coming back, we'll see what the world is up to when I graduate. "

"Thankfully no. Most common hallucination for me, when it comes to auditory - is just gibberish noise, no matter where I go. It is annoying, so it makes me very irritable. Never heard voices, but I know some that do. Visuals are very imaginative. However, the most common visual hallucinations in the past year or so have been something very similar to [fregoli delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fregoli_delusion), how I experience this is that people that I both know and do not know are either unrecognizable, or really recognizable in someone else. It's hard to explain, but I can give you an example. Last week I took the bus to the psychiatrist, on the bus i saw my sister (it was impossible for her to be there at that time), she went out of the bus, and a couple of minutes later I saw her again sitting somewhere else on the bus. Then I saw her two times, at the same time.

Two years ago I used to have an imaginary friend, which I thought was real"
I don't really have one

How long do you use the internet for?
"Yes, they are professing Christians (as am I ). 

Overall, they felt that a lot of our local schools had been dumbed down to the level of the lower students, and with homeschooling, each individual child  can be taught at the level they are, and especially in the things they are proficient in. (Not all of us -&gt; &lt;- are good at math for instance)

They also have rescued a child with special needs who had been starved in an orphanage in Bulgaria for years. We adopted her at age 9 and she weighed 10 pounds.  We now have 3 children with special needs, and they do go to classes at School, and that has been working very well. "

The words Flat Earth put together with Scientist is illogical. "
How long can you hold your breath under water?
"That's because r/thedonald is not a political group, it's an ideology.  Those people worship him like a crummy, orange, god."
My brother bought it at 100 bucks a share. But lost it because the company got hacked. Are you also on suicide watch?
I've never tried it before
All i do is make it as juicy and tasty as possible. 
Long hours with minimal time actually doing anything. I don't find it very rewarding.
I was suffering from severe IBS/GERD and vitamin D deficiency. I was depressed but I don't think they knew the depression part then. Mom started to see symptoms of depression much later.
"Not so much recently, but it used to be that my parents couldn't interact that much in public because of the stigma. Personally for me, In jr high and boyscouts, it was an extra thing to get picked on for. ""This guy is gay, just like his parents"". "
I try not to pick favorites because all of my relatives are amazing. 
"Like my mother, I am very disappointed in myself"
"I didn't leave because of Trump (I was already gone by that point), but I am not coming home this holiday season because of Trump.*

*I'm not coming home because the family I come from has a huge Trump boner and my spirit just can't take it.  So, I'm staying in Europe where I'm around sane people. 

"
I understand. I have to write a seven page by Monday and I haven't started yet. 
Certainly not here. 
Mate... By the time I get to the fifth wank me bollocks and knob are gonna need a right proper skin graft. You have fun mate
"In your opinion, what is the worst thing you can do/say to someone?"
The weirdest shit I've seen is a guy who wanted to pretend that he had two dicks because he wanted to be different. It was weird and he was weird in general. 
All the time
Where do you like to celebrate the holidays the most? 
What aspect of her life does she need to sort out? She works in the sex industry. It‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of. We all prostitute ourselves everyday we go to work. Congratulations by the way OP.
"I'm straight, I prefer women. But I am bisexual for pay. "
"1 if I‚Äôm a bit hungry, but if I‚Äôm really starving I could go for 3. "
Poor leadership. I‚Äôve been Walmart blue in this store for almost two years and came here with the idea of taking my own store. Your quality of life as a salaried Manager is 100% dependent on your Store Manager and to a lesser extent your Market Manger. I was the second Co to leave in the last few months and an Assistant left with me.
How many hot dogs can you eat in one sitting?
28 and mainly just a fascination with sex
My mother
I may be wrong... but they may have meant it like do you celebrate Mother's Day for both your biological mother AND her wife?
"You mentioned you are homeschooled,  do you know how that decision was made vs. public school? Also, would you say your parents are religious?"
Girth brooks
This is a really good idea of an AMA. Kudos 
How big is your penis?
I was definitely not possessed. My mom definitely knew that and as I said mom and i don't believe in this kinda shit. My dad's family has a history of believing in it. Anytime something happens to someone they   take them to  some voodoo guy.
Lmao I‚Äôm choosing to believe this is edited 
"Yes, of course"
"Okay, this is the best one."
Describe how you prepare your steak.

"**Fregoli delusion**

The Fregoli delusion, or the delusion of doubles, is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. The syndrome may be related to a brain lesion and is often of a paranoid nature, with the delusional person believing themselves persecuted by the person they believe is in disguise.

A person with the Fregoli delusion can also inaccurately recall places, objects, and events. This disorder can be explained by ""associative nodes"".
