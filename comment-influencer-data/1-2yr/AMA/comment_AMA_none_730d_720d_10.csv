Do you dream of electric rats
"Thats almost two years you fucking psychopath lol

edit: *almost* 2 years"
"My wife and I were at her parents one day and her younger sister was sitting on the couch with her boyfriend. Her sister was 17, she was dating a guy who was like 19 or 20. Well we were watching the news together, my wife's parents and siblings, and towards the end of the program, the weekly ""deadbeat dads"" segment came on. After a couple of other dudes were pictured on the screen while the anchor was giving out their info on the dads, trying to get people to assist in catching these dudes. I wanna think that there was a small reward offered by the sherif in return for info. Wel the boyfriends mug popped up, all his info was correct, he was just really good at avoiding the cops trying to find him. My sister-in-law had no idea that he even had a kid! Things went south pretty damn quick! Their dad (my FIL) was a constable at the time. He radioed it in, and we all had a really awkward 25 minutes before a deputy showed up. The FIL actually pulled out his service weapon and sat it on the dinner table. "
Yes
Why not a fan.. or a radio...
Its just been in there for so long I dont want to change it. Lol
If you showed up for work as frequently as you did for this AMA then I understand. 
"Do you fall asleep, if you watch the movie mid day?"
"Shit, man, I'm your age and I feel for you. This kind of thing scares the shit out of me. Best of luck"
I don't necessarily fall asleep but it definitely makes me noticeably tired because I associate the movie with trying to fall asleep
Have you ever thought of reaching out to u/doubledickdude ? 
Met up with a girl i met online and we had sex. Turns out she didn't know she was positive as well. Kinda ruined my life.. 
Why is it the only movie available?
I use a fan too. 
"Well, i do have health insurance but the medical treatment from where i come from is affordable even for a student such as myself. About $60 - $80 a month. 

Well, i'm hoping my school life won't change much. With the medication i'm taking, i should be as good as new. Well, with the addition of popping pills every 24 hours. I also made some changed to my lifestyle, eating cleaner and working out more. Try to help my immune system any way i can. 

Well, she was the latest person i slept with. I think she took it harder than me. She slept with many more people and i think maybe guilt is playing a part? I told her that personally, i won't hold it against her. Just try to tell those she did sleep with to get tested. 

Well i am a christian. I didn't really affect me too much. I personally look to god for solace and comfort. So in that aspect no, but it did make me wonder why these things happen. I also at some point was contemplating taking my own life. I couldn't bare the shame and ridicule that will come my way. But as stupid as this sounds, the fear of god prevented me from doing that. All in all, in some weird way it kinda made me believe in my beliefs more? 

It's cool, no need to be sorry. I was an idiot in the first place. "
"I was imprisoned at the Allan B Polunsky unit in Livingston, Texas. It houses the states death row inmates also, I was one of the 'lucky' to share the same building as them and it was all solitary. There is only so much you can do to pass the time. TV isn't allowed and the radio didn't work (that I paid for!!!!). I read and wrote a lot. I'd workout to tire myself out so I could sleep as much as I could. Everything gets very old, very quickly. I spoke to myself a lot and created stories and conversations, It may sound strange but it helped to pretend."
How much weight do you think you'd lose if you quit pussyfooting around and took a dump already?
You didnÂ´t use sick leave for 30 years though right? 
"Not to rain on your encouragement parade, but if you fuck 50 people in one day without protection, you are kind of opening the door to every std ever.

But you could fuck 50 people with protection and still catch HIV, which would be unlikely, but very possible.  And you could also fuck 50 people in one day without protection and not catch anything.

I'm sorry I cannot agree with your phrasing, but I agree with what I hope you were trying to convey with your message.

The key is communication.  No one who knows that they have and STD should engage in sex without informing their partner and using protection."
"I'm currently with a fine Pamela Handerson. 

I am trying online. I don't really want a life partner, I don't want to hold someone down and make them watch me suffer on my bad days, or make them feel like they are obligated to treat me super well and be scared to show their flaws just because I'm more delicate. I don't think I could handle a separate person - she'd have to do a ridiculous amount of housework and cleaning and favors and she'd feel like a servant or caretaker rather than a partner, and I can't promise I'd be able to take her to do fun things, or always be able to fully please her in bed, or do things I would want to do for her to show my appreciation. 

I'll just spend a night in with Grandma watching movies or playing Scrabble, and bring some flowers. That's always great when I have too much love trapped inside of me. Or go to a restaurant with my mom and and buy that expensive cheesecake she really likes. Here's to wiping my 16 year old ass ---- you deserve it."
I married up.  She's also a pastry chef so I'm fat now.  
"1. Being able to wait hours to get good spots for my favorite artists without worrying about other people's wants

2. Meeting a ton of new people who were also there alone"
"thanks man, stay safe and don't be a idiot like me. "
I'd probably have to get a new copy of Ratatouille 
Oh god. I'm imagining all the neurotic and hypochondriac redditers thinking they've got AIDS now.
"Yeah, when you see a movie that much you begin to be fond of it"
My wife has done that with Harry Potter 1 for 16 years.  
Have you ever tried ASMR Videos?
"I did a similar thing with Frasier, when life was a little rough. Everything OK?"
"Small thing I learned a long time ago, if everyone around you is an asshole, you're the asshole."
"My husband was caught on the show. I was sitting in a room with my mom and grandparents and littlest sister, who was 12 or so, teaching her the dangers of the internet.  Nothing could ever have prepared me to see my husband come onto the screen. I was young,22, and he was 2 years older than me. We had been married for almost 3 years and though things were not perfect- nothing led me to think this would ever be my reality. I literally got up and left my grandparents house, called the police to escort me to pick up my things and then left him. Really crummy life experience that dictated the next few years of my life before I realized it wasn't my fault. 10 years later I have forgiven myself, but never him. "
Ratatoullie is more interesting 
"I hope you know - you're not an idiot, and no action or lapse or whatever brought this your way. You could've banged 50 people without a condom in a day and you still wouldn't be an idiot. It's a shitty disease that can affect anyone. 

I think you're brilliant for sharing your experience in a forum like this. It helps to reduce stigma, promotes awareness &amp; increases empathy in general. 

All the very best, and good on you again. "
Does anal intercourse lead to anal leakage when one is older?
"I waited a month to take a preliminary test (90% accurate) and then another 2-3 months to take the final test (99% accurate)

There are a myriad of symptoms and you might not even have any. That's the scary part, if i didn't get a sore throat. I honestly would have gone about life normally (Which would be for the worst) "
Jeez....talk about awkward.

"Probably 100+, likely more"
"There's a difference between ""there is no god"" in the context of normal conversation and ""there is no god"" in the context of a recently diagnosed HIV patient explaining that their faith is the only thing carrying them through said turbulent time and was a contributing factor towards their decision not to kill themselves. It's like going up to a rape victim who's cradling a cat and explaining that the cat doesn't really love them and it's merely sticking close to them for warmth and a Pavlovian response triggered by previous occasions where the cat was given food due to it's proximity to people. Sure you'd be correct but you'd still be a petty cunt."
My ex wife hit me a couple of times in front of one of my sons. Best thing that ever happened to me. It was one of the main reasons I ended up with full custody of my three boys. 
"I wouldn't say your life is ruined. The current length that people live on average after being diagnosed is 35 years. Five years ago it was 25. So you are more likely to die of heart failure than from AIDS if you stay on anti-virals. Also, many people have found that anti-viral medications can temporarily bring their viral load down to undetectable levels, which means that the likelihood of you giving someone HIV years down the line is 97% lower than if you were not medicating. 

Your life is going to be much different in some ways, but I can promise you it is not going to be as different as you think, and it is certainly not ""ruined.""

One day you will be able to get married, you could probably even marry an HIV negative woman (Or man) and if y'all are both taking the proper preventative steps it's very possible that she could never get it. We've already seen advancements in medication bring about the ability for HIV positive mothers to have HIV negative biological children. I'm pretty sure that you will be just fine. "
And fortunate that there actually *is* medication. It used to be a death sentence. Now it's just a nuisance...
Your wife sounds cool
"I've seen men kill themselves, light themselves on fire, mutilate themselves, run into walls, lose the ability to talk etc. If someone is willing to set themselves on fire 3 months before release, what do you think? When I say I still hear screams at night, o really do. Bloodcurdling screams of inmates losing there minds will stay with me forever. Being on the DR unit for a long while, I saw first hand what the hopelessness of solitary confinement can do to the human spirit. Solitary does need to end."
"My ex assaulted me two days before we were set to move across the country and start life where I landed my residency position as a doctor. I had to see a neurologist one day before starting because I realized I couldn't move my left hand a full day later. Total damage assessed: Nerve damage to left arm, rehab of at least 8 weeks for ""probable"" return of function. One concussion from an end table over the head. Several stabs from a scissors. Several small cuts from bottles being thrown at me. Bites requiring antibiotics. One small bone broken in my wrist trying to hold her off. Hematoma from aforementioned table over the head I had to drain myself with a scalpel because of how bad it looked and being afraid of being seen as ""unprofessional"".  

One of my wounds ended up getting infected. Cue further antibiotics.

I am not a small man. I fought competitively in martial arts for a long span of time. I just wanted to resolve the conflict without hurting her.

The messed up part? I knew if I reported it I was more likely to be arrested than her, in which case I would lose my residency position. I didn't report it. I left instead and am starting a new life out here on my own. I completed my rehab and have about 90% function of my hand back. Still working for the last 10%, but I think it will return in time if I'm lucky.

We stand together friend.

As brothers in conflict I am always here to listen and help however I can. It's too easy to feel isolated in our position, and I'll be damned if I let somebody else go through what I did knowingly and not extend a hand out to help.

Do not talk to her. Not a single letter.

Burn that bridge. Never look back."
"A sore throat is a pretty vague symptom. How did you jump from that to 'I should get tested for HIV'. Was there anything else that tipped you off. 

"
"Do you have health insurance? How is that changing with this diagnosis?

How will work or school change with this diagnosis?

Do you know if you passed it to anyone else between when you got it and when you found out? How did you tell them and how did they react?

Are you a religious person? Has this experience changed your view/belief/unbelief in any way?

I'm sorry, I wouldn't wish that on anybody."
on the inside
"As someone who works in a HIV clinic, please take your meds as prescribed! I have seen countless patient disregard this and think they can take their meds only when they feel bad. Then they're body becomes immune to that medication and that becomes one less medication that could have helped the patient. Take as prescribed and you'll live a normal life."
How many times have you masturbated whilst it's on? Don't lie.
"&gt; as a kid

Fucking hell that movie came out 10 years ago.."
"All internally. From the outside you would never be able to tell it was any different. 

I'm 24 and I accurately self-diagnosed myself with a vaginal septum when I was 13 but I couldn't get any doctors to listen to me until I was finally diagnosed at 20 years old. I had no idea I had two uteri until they diagnosed me though."
"As for the actual science and engineering behind why Roman structures are so sturdy and robust, I will say that their use of the arch and dome design provided an extremely strong support structure.  I have little authority to speak further on how the physics and engineering of Roman buildings works. My focus of study concerns how the architecture and art reflects the sociocultural institutions and values of the Romans and how the Greeks contributed to this Roman ethos. 

That being said, it was of the highest importance to the leaders of the Republic and subsequently the Emperors of Rome to maintain a city that reflected Rome's dominance, power, and most importantly for architecture, perpetuity.  Therefore the Romans poured untold amounts of money and manpower into the research, development, and construction of buildings that would reflect the values they maintained of Rome as the biggest and the best. 

I hope I answered your question as best I could; I think that for a more adequate answer you would need an engineer or someone with more of a specialty in the science behind why the structures of Rome are among the most durable and sound ever built.


Edit: After a brief glance at my notes and a google search, I remembered that the Romans were the first to develop sound, reliable concrete mixtures, similar to the concrete we use today. This of course was a major contributor to the integrity of not only their architecture, but infrastructure as a whole. "
"I know that logically, but it's still rough. I love that girl, and there were times when she was sweet and loving. Looking back on it it's like I was dating 2 different people. I'm going back and forth in my head like, ""If I had just said this"" ""If I had just done that""."
do you quote the movie in every day life?
why is this a different username than the post?
"I went to school, and worked with someone who was caught on that show. He was a quiet, nerdy kid. Kindof odd, but smart with little ""common sense"". He was religious (Christian), and his family was upper middle class. He went to meet, what he thought was a 14  year old girl, IIRC. His chat logs were very graphic, but I knew him well enough, I'm sure he was a virgin. Not to excuse what he did, he was wrong, but I'm sure he was just lonely and wanted a girlfriend. He quit working where I worked to go to college, and shortly after the episode aired he came into the store and was very outgoing, and odly happy. He hadn't come to visit prior to, or after that. I think he took some kind of plea deal and didn't do any jail time. I think he had to register as a sex offender for a period of time as well.  

Edit: he was sentenced to 10 years, and did 4. He had to register for life as a sex offender ."
To you maybe. But God/faith and spirituality is personal. This definitely isn't the thread for this comment. 
"Unfortunately there is no solution, it's something i'll have to live with. I am fortunate in the sense that the medication is heavily subsidised. "
"Well in all honesty, i suspected that i had it. A few symptoms started to show. But it was a huge blow psychologically. Add that to the fact that i really cannot tell anyone about my situation and it's really hard. But, i've got to take things in my stride i guess? "
Thanks for a great AMA.  You know you have to show up right?  How did you really lose your job?  
"Occupy yourself. Find anything, write, read, clean, sing, sleep. Take it a day at a time. "
"You know, I have conducted many um... purely scientific experiments in an attempt to find out, and the results have been inconclusive. I think I have 1 G-spot that might actually be split between the two vaginas? But its really hard to tell, so I can't say for sure. I personally find it uncomfortable to have two fingers in both vaginas, so whether I can stimulate it on both sides is kind of ruined by how uncomfortable it is. There's probably people out there with the same condition with two though!"
"You know it wasn't your fault, right? "
A decent amount
No condom?  
I thought he was busted for bullshit. 
Is Ratatouille your favorite movie?
"It's either could **HAVE** or could**'VE**, but never could **OF**. 

 See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information."
How much of Ratatouille can you reciete off the top of your head?
"I see you saying sore throats and aches and pains, but everyone gets them, what was it that set yours apart and got you to suspecting the diagnosis?

And I noticed you said treatment was affordable bc of your location, what's the general of your location affecting this?"
How did you catch it?
"It looks completely normal from the outside, so you might as well look at any other pic of a vagina and I can assure you it looks the same."
Yes
Be a troll somewhere else. This is a pretty serious discussion.
"Nah, after 30 years, you've ""aged out"", but shhhh....because that's illegal, they had to find something, anything.  "
"No, just a thing I use to follow asleep"
this is not the posting account. you are posting from two different accounts and that's making you look dumb.
Disarray
did u died?
I've had a sore throat for the past week... probably HIV

Do you change the language every once in a while just to have a bit of variety?
WebMD duh
"Well, it was not what I expected. Maybe because I didn't know what to do exactly. He pretty much stole a kiss from me the other day when he asked me to help him with something in the cooler (at work in a diner). Today we met somewhere nearby for lunch and made out. In his car. It felt awkward at first but he showed me how to kiss him and things picked up a little from there. I always thought that when I did kiss a guy it would feel natural and I would know what to do somehow. Not so but I will say that it felt good. It was exciting but not any more romantic than you could expect being in a car in a parking lot..... I can't stop thinking about the time we spent together this afternoon."
why do you think the Romans were able to create such quality buildings compared to the majority of buildings today?
"I hope we can get a cure in your lifetime man. You refer to yourself as an idiot, but aren't we all. We were designed to make mistakes. Try to not be too hard on yourself. In the end we all die. All of the best. "
This is a pathetic excuse for an AMA. OP is clearly using two or more names here trying to sway opinion and discussion.
