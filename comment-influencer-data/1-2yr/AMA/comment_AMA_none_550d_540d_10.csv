"I stopped watching ever since you started covering up your camera, to be honest."
legit curiousity question. How do you guys deal with women who are on their period? Do they just wear a tampon and keep it moving? 
You say that like it is easy

one time a super creepy man asked if I could rock him to sleep. The answer was a swift no

Your username makes me doubt the veracity of these claims.

I came here to say the same thing. Thank you 
"Off the top of my head this story comes to mind:

I was serving dinner for the home owners and another couple. They were drinking VERY expensive wine and it was over 30 years old. Now the thing with wine of that age is the cork can dry out and then be very crumbly. So this bottle of wine will not open easily and the cork is simply crumbling, I ended up having to pour it through a chinois and then back into the bottle via funnel, many people wouldn’t think sounds like a stressful night but in my line it is. 


One more oh shit moment-I was  cleaning up after dinner one night and I was hand drying a wine glass.  Mind you this isn’t any wine glass..this was a handmade Verona glass, worth over 10K each.  As I was drying it, the handle snapped off I nearly had a heart attack. She does have a set of 2 dozen so it will not be easily noticed. I then had to bring this glass to a artisan glass blower and he was able to fix almost immediately. I was so lucky that day. But that’s being a butler, you worry about the shit so the home owner doesn’t have to. "
"Since I made this, I am 9 pages in. And it is due in 4 hours"
"Well the only rule i can think of is that our parents told us we shouldnt tell anyone at school and such. 
As for visits, we are almost always clothed when someone comes by, just with a few of our best friends we remained naked, as did they. And in those cases their own parents always knew and were okay with it "
"Were there ever arguments in your family about what temperature to keep the house at? If one person is hot and one is cold, you can’t exactly take off more clothes to get cooler, so I’m curious."
"Yes, I have a funny story about that. I was once in the dumpster swimming some laps looking for stuff, then I hear someone say, ""hello?"" I look up to see an employee looking inside the dumpster at me. No clue why I did this, but I look up at him and go, ""hi welcome to chillis."" Guy gave me a weird look and said I don't care that you're out here but management might. So good luck "
yes i do not
Shut up and dance
yes that is the week i dont leave my room witch is this week
I was a waiter in a high end restaurant in high school and this couple would come in a lot. After some time they asked if I would like to work in their home serving meals and running errands. This job continued all through college(which they paid for) and once I graduated I did one final year with them. I loved them like family but they didn’t actually need me on staff. Originally they wanted me for those two original things and once they saw I liked it/was flourishing they just made space for me on staff.  They would not be around for a few months in the winter every year as well which gave me time for my studies. After school I was craving a bigger role and since I knew I couldn’t work for them in this created position forever I moved on to the next family with their blessing. My original principle family and I still keep in touch and I’ll forever be grateful to them for all the help they’ve given me. They set the bar high for me(standards to follow at work) as well as what I expect out of an employer.

"Well yea it does happen at the start of puberty i guess. But after some time it doesnt happen anymore cause I was used to seeing everyone naked. 
And noone reacted to it, it was just normal for boys that age. But after some time it didnt happen anymore "
Why
You have no power. 
"I’ve had to deny people who think I’m an easy lay because I work there. For some reason they think because they are friends with my boss and they have some $$ I’ll be down for whatever with them. 

One time I had to deny an 11 year old weed. He was visiting the house I manage and he tried to take me aside and ask me super politely if I could get him weed. I said I couldn’t do that and he proceeded to tell me all about how his father is friends with my boss, and if he tells his father I was mean he will tell my boss and I’ll be fired. Needless to say i didn’t get it for him and I’m not intimidated by little shit kids. "
Must have been terrifying for the other guy. One moment he’s getting busy raping this chick and the next moment some rabid stoner bursts out of a wardrobe screaming and attacking him with a coat rack. Damn. 
"Holy shit I remember you posting an AMA about it yesterday. I never thought you were going to make it. 
1) How did you feel when you finished it and turned it in?
2) What were you thinking halfway thru the paper?
3) Does anyone know this accomplishment? If so, what was/is their reaction?

I think talking about it is the best way for you to deal with this and im glad you're doing it

You’re a hero. My SO was in an abusive relationship prior to mine. It’s been a year and a half and we’re still making progress. You saved that girl from the most traumatic thing someone can do to another person.

SERIOUSLY OP ANSWER THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS 
"My current employers are wonderful people. They are kind, generous, and thoughtful. Though they are not generations old wealth, but they are highly respected by new money and old alike. The family I left to start this current position was about as bad as you can imagine. For example, they would call me at midnight on a Tuesday because they got drunk and needed 2 cigarettes or my bosses friend got drunk while out on the town and instead of calling an Uber, he would call me at 2AM to go pick him up and drive him around. But then the next day complain that my house were too high. He essentially thought he could afford my staff and me but in the end he could not and expected one person to do the work of 4. I had to leave him due to unrealistic expectations. That happens more than you’d want too. Overall, if you want to have a good experience you need to find a family that you get along with exceptionally well since you are such an intimate part of their life and wear so many different hats. "
I dare you to leave the seats up in the bathrooms.
"I started during a pi-memorization competition in seventh grade-- I'm a pretty competitive person, so I memorized about 60 digits the night before and found it fun. I also tend to have short-lived, weird, obscure obsessions with things I temporarily find interesting. I guess when you combine those two personality traits, you get somebody who's willing to spend way too much time memorizing random numbers."

silly but a serious question.... does it ever happen during tour puberty you git erect in front of everyone?. how do you control a bonner at home. how does your family react when something like this happens
"&gt;shall pass 

Unlike OP"
well i wasn't in foster homes i was in a big like apartment building  turned into a house with staff and things like that food was always good we get to have pizza once a month so that was cool bed i shared a room with 3 other people my 1st group all got adopted expect me 2nd same thing 3rd same thing 4th went to my foster home (now my home its so wired to say that) entertainment is tv broad games and stuff like that think of it this way its like having 40 siblings that you dont know if your ever going to see them again when you wake up in the morning 
"I typically work Monday thru Friday 8 to 5. If there is something I need to stay for obviously I will stay later or come in early. Whatever I have to, in order to get the job done. If there is an event on the weekend I will be there for that but I manage 22 people in my current position so there is always someone there even if I’m off. I run the house like a small hotel, I have different departments and each dept gets their own schedule. It is similar to a small very high end hotel in many ways, from the constant stream of guests to the private parties and how almost all services come to the house instead of going out to them. "

"My base salary is 155K but then I also get a car, 100% paid benefits, and a retirement account.  Some positions I’ve had also provided a house with all utilities paid. It all depends on the family and the more they want from you, the more perks they are going offer. For example the house sounds nice, but then you realize it’s right next-door and you’re kind of “living in the poison”. It is a lucrative field in my experience, you just have to be good at your job to keep it. "
lol what time is it due? this is how i used to be when i was in school.

Are there any kind of rules for that?  What happens when you get visits?
Yep
"It absolutely is a different world once you hit that $100,000,000 mark. If you think about it, you can’t really have all the trappings of wealth without that much. Yes, most people could take a fraction of that and be 100% fine for the rest of their lives. But think about it....someone buys a mega yacht. There is $25-$50 million or even more. Then you need a house with a deep water dock, there’s another $10-15 million. But don’t forget...that’s not your house, that’s the boat house. You get into your $1 million dollar Ferrari and drive to your $20 million dollar estate. You’ve practically spent $100 million right there...and the upkeep on all the properties and toys also adds up very quickly. 
When your at that level all services come to you instead of you going to the store or salon. When your at that level your time is usually so valuable that it wouldn’t make sense for you to do your own “chores of life” If you took an hour and went to the grocery store that would take an hour away from work and if you make 20 million a year, that trip to the store just cost you $7,700. Your home also becomes more than just a place you live, it is a work of art. Even the items your decorating with (at least in the classic houses) are typically antiquities and will go up in value provided there is a knowledgeable staff who cares for it properly. When your at that level it is easy to live in a bubble of sorts. You go from one beautiful bubble to the next beautiful bubble. "

"To me, YOU are the victim. Unfortunately, this woman carelessly ran into the road and caused her own death. You were the unfortunate person who just happened to be on the road when she did so. 

No matter how you spin this, this is not your fault. She made a bad decision and in a split second, it changed your life and her family's life. 

I believe that if she were alive, she'd feel guilty. I know it may seem weird to say but ultimately her choice caused this accident. She'd apologize to you, for causing you stress and grief. She'd apologize to her loved ones, for doing something so careless.

The only way someone could blame you is by wishing you weren't on the road that day. At that point, they're better off wishing there was no road.. that cars weren't invented or better yet.. that she never fought with her family etc.. That just doesn't make sense.

This wasn't your fault. This was an accident and you were also a victim of the events that transpired that day. You deserve understanding and compassion. It could have been anyone. Unfortunately, it was you that day. Be compassionate with yourself. Tell yourself you did what you could and that it wasn't your fault. Because that's the truth."
Both actually. I gave my students an assignment and I am talking about their performance and how they learn and what I’ll do next and yada yada yada.

"An awkward story-We we’re having a fundraiser dinner in the home. This house is very open and museum like and we had setup a bunch of round tables of 8 or 10, I can’t remember and it’s not important. So it is a little tight because it is a charity event and we are trying to squeeze as many people in as possible. So we had hired a outside catering company and usually they know the kind of waiters to send. They must’ve been low on staff because they sent this one waiter who was really fat. My boss has a, I don’t want to say phobia, but she really hates fat people. Nothing we can do about it, so I take him aside and tell him he needs to stay away from the home owner. He says ok and the night proceeds. Now we’re in the swing of things and the dinner is being served. The fat waiter is doke his job and wasn’t thinking and squeezed his fat body in between my bosses chair and the person sitting at the table behind her. I saw the look or horror and disgust on her face as his fat sweaty stomach touched her and she immediately called me over to tell me to fire the fat waiter. I apologize profusely and grab the waiter. I bring him in the kitchen and he was kept on garbage detail the rest of the night. I got some serious shit for that one but I felt too bad to just fire him on the spot for being fat. Other than that she was a really nice lady though. "

"The families contribute to a retirement plan. If you work for the same person for twenty plus years, chances are they are going to provide for you in retirement. Not everyone will, so that’s just another reason it’s so important to find the right family. You can always tell if a family is desirable to work for because if they are there is virtually no staff turnover. I was once in a position that had 15 other people in it in less than 2 years. "

"if your gf didn't agree with you , would you start wearing clothes for her and also grow kids the same way?"
I fake it with them and they don’t realize that I’ve been circumcised. You’d be surprised at how little some people know about the anatomy of the vagina. To make up for my lack of sensation I typically have rough sex and my previous partners have seemed to like that. One of my previous partners commented that he noticed I got circumcised when I didn’t react like “other girls” to him touching me.

"For some families you do travel with them. If it’s a travel position the employer will normally ask if you have a family and such.

"UPDATE- apparently mother dearest was ill informed, her son was actually killed due to an undisclosed amount of money in what is suspected as a drug transaction gone wrong. The blame is coming because she has no one else to blame for her sons poor life decisions."
I’m married and my husband travels about 3 weeks out of the month for work so we don’t get too see each other too much. We do enjoy the time we get though! In general you don’t get too much of a personal life in this line of work. 
"First of all, the number of people who would care to watch you privately masturbating is probably not very big. You are just another person to 99.9999% of the world. Plus when people aren’t being watched they are likely not at their most flattering/ attractive. unlike someone who is knowingly being recorded or even just in a room with one other person seeing them. it’s much more likely someone with this ability would be watching/ recording celebrities and selling the copies for profit. Furthermore, the number of people who have the ability to hack into your smart phone camera is very small. And the chance that these two relatively small pools of people overlapping is incredible unlikely. (Plus they would have to be type to do this morally and unlawfully)

Secondly, who cares? Right now the whole thing is like Schrödinger’s cat, you are living your life the same way regardless, because you don’t know if someone is watching or not. And although it’s a overwhelmingly likely they are not, even if they are, it isn’t hurting you. You are unharmed. 

You never consented to it or agreed to an invasion of your privacy so it isn’t really something people can rationally judge you for. Unless you were watching some really wacky fetish porn or they are completely opposed to masturbation in general, in which case they are vastly outnumbered by masturbators and likely surrounded by them on a daily basis, so they have bigger things to worry about. 

So keep choking your chicken or flicking your bean! You can rest easy knowing nobody saw, or at least it doesn’t matter. "

Congratulations :) I'm happy you've found a loving family! What has been the best and what has been the worst thing about your experience in the foster system?
"Very close family member, my Mom, not sure about closer than anyone else, I have 1 sibling, but she was my world. 
  
Zero clue, she taught me how to save, how to only shop clearance or outlets, a food sales hoarder, but she was on a huge pedestal in my eyes. I thought she was the smartest, so that everything she taught me must have been right.  
Any and all gifts were maybe 50$ and the only time I ever saw larger money spent, was after weeks of research onto the product.
  
Yes, she was extremely generous and several of her important charities received large amounts as well. My sibling got the same that I did, although some of the estate is still being settled so there's an additional unknown amount as well. 
  
I learned of it when going to meet with her finance person after she passed. The executor of the estate didn't reveal any inclination of the amount, maybe they thought we knew. 
I thought possibly 6 figures as that would make sense, but i learned that day that my math sucked, I was shown the numbers of the different accts and the total for just me and couldn't grasp it. Still can't. For an estimate, it was about 3x the size posed in the title. 
  
It has been almost a year and I still shop clearance, I still sort by lowest price, I had huge anxiety buying my new car for the 1st time ever and slowly I'm doing renovations on my ranch house.
The number is unreal.  My whole life was based on getting paid to pay the bills and if extra then save it. I used to grocery shop at the dollar tree. I probably will still shop there as needed.
soo that's a long story
  
TL:dr- inherited a very large amount of money that was a surprise"
"I’ve heard of some crazy parties and the debauchery that happens in them, mostly at a gay couples estate. The rumor is that they have one employee whose sole job it is to go around the country and find hot young men to invite over for their weekend long parties all airfare and expenses paid. I would imagine their time is paid for as well. Thing is, this gay couple isn’t bad looking. They’re not totally old and gross, not that being old equals gross...I more mean people who don’t take care of themselves during the aging process. "
Any regrets for starting it so late?
Yes definitely
All of the time. I used to feel like I wasn’t “Woman” enough and that no man would want to be with me since I couldn’t feel pleasure normally. I became resentful and angry at some stage because I couldn’t orgasm. Imagine stimulating your vagina but feeling like it’s numbed. I had my first orgasm at the age of 20 when I bought myself a magic wand. I still feel kind of jealous when my friends describe how pleasurable sex can be. Especially oral sex. I’ve had my boyfriend give me oral sex and it felt like he was licking my arm.
"I answer a good chunk of this in a thread further down but I also want to add this - my having a disability doesn't mean I can't raise my kids or have problems raising them in general and is honestly why I wanted to do this AMA. So many people have these notions that all disabilities are the same and that my being in a wheelchair automatically makes me mentally or physically unfit, and that's not true. I'm able to do a great number of things and adapt to a lot of others - I've had to do that my entire life. 

Truthfully, my CP is pretty mild compared to others. I have average intelligence, my speech isn't affected, nor my arms. I basically look and act like a normal person who just so happens to sit in a chair with wheels.

My kids are happy, healthy and thriving, and that's what matters "
