"I'm going to finish college, and pay off my remaining student loans, and pay off any other outstanding debts that I have. 

I'm buying my first car once I finish driving school and I'll be purchasing my first house when I finally find the one I'm looking for.

But most importantly, I'll finally be able to help my parents out. They've helped me out my entire life, and to see them still working everyday,  my dad at 61 and my mom at 67, it hurts. More so my dad than my mom. My dad works in construction and his knees have been giving out and I want to help them have the best years of their lives. "
wtf no I don't even have a life

OP. I've read on the internet that you are very attractive. Are you really as attractive as they say?

You might want to talk to a financial planner.  I would hate for you to spend too much and end up in the hole.  Sorry I don't mean to be a buzz kill.  
Honestly never done anything too weird. Just regular sex and shit

"I started during a pi-memorization competition in seventh grade-- I'm a pretty competitive person, so I memorized about 60 digits the night before and found it fun. I also tend to have short-lived, weird, obscure obsessions with things I temporarily find interesting. I guess when you combine those two personality traits, you get somebody who's willing to spend way too much time memorizing random numbers."
No. I'm always surprised when i look in the mirror. I often scare myself if I walk past my reflection. I've had green hair for about a year now though which helps me recognize myself and also helps my family and friends find me of I get lost in a crowd.
How old were you during your oldest memory?
Weirdest sex act you've done to your gf?

Where is there 0 answers in the thread from EA or Dice?
"There's too many to say which is the weirdest... the first one that comes to mind is this guy who had this fantasy where everyone was a hermaphrodite. Whoever had the biggest penis was the dominant one that penetrated the other one. I was supposed to pretend his was so big when I saw it, then take my clothes off to reveal that mine was bigger. I can't remember a ton of details, I just remember after he came he continued talking about the roleplay as if he were narrating a book for at least 3 more minutes. It was... something else.

Another strange one - I was directed to scream for him to help me as I sank into quicksand. I've also talked about abortion, death and magic potions. Lots of strange stuff."

"Oooh good question! Well I know what a face looks like and I can distinguish between different faces just fine, it's more like the thing connecting the face to the person is broken. So people in my dreams do have faces but maybe not the accurate face? I'm trying to remember how a person i know looks like in my dream but I can't remember how they look in my dream or in real life... There isn't so much a focus on the face I suppose. I can't recall ever having a dream where I looked into anyone's face directly. "
One. And that's not a finger.
"But this is important. Everyone is up in arms when someone disgusting like Weinstein is accused, because he's gross inside and out, right? It's easy in that case isn't it? 
We need more of the Spaceys to come into the light, so that people have to deal with and judge their heroes and the people they admire. They can't be excused for this behavior anymore just because they're good at something. "
"No I don't remember anyone, not even myself. By their face anyway. Over time you do learn to recognize people by other things like voice and movements and things like that. I tend not to rely too much on looks because if they ever change haircut for example I wouldn't recognize them again."
It's illegal to pose anonymously as a lottery winner when claiming your prize. Having my face out there is going to scare the shit out of me in the beginning.  
"Man, I am having visuals to the point where I can't really tell what's real and what's not it's just sort of augmented reality, I can't seem to relax my body even tho I took .5 mg of Xanax when I realized I'd done three times the most I'd ever done before, I went to a pretty ghetto ass movie theater with my roommates and it was terribly uncomfortable, sound wasn't loud enough and it was too bright, also was a maybe 50 person room pretty crowded, idk at one point I started thinking about the really long significant relationship I had (10 years off and on again, I'm 26 now so basically 16-25 years old we dated. Lost virginity to each other and so on ) and I realized that I was over it and I didnt hate her and honestly would love to talk to her and bring some closure to it if possible and I was really happy and crying and I realized that it made no sense to be crying at that scene in the movie and I felt super awkward "
"I've never heard of face blindness until now. What are your dreams like? I've read that the brain can only recreate already known faces in dreams, so what do people look like in dreams for you? "

"Yeah it does occasionally happen that someone gets offended if I can't remember them, thinking I'm just pretending I don't know who they are because I don't like them or whatever. I try to tell people I'm faceblind pretty quickly after meeting them so I can avoid an awkward situation later."

"There are two types of face blindness (prosopagnosia); one caused by a head injury (congenital prosopagnosia) and then one caused by a genetic mutation (developmental prosopagnosia). Now I have developmental face blindness and I got it from my dad, who also has it. 
It can be really hard to recognize my family members and friends but I've learned to look at other things like the way they walk and the way they move their hands. I also rely heavily on sound, like the sound of their voice of course and the sound of their footsteps."

We are largest car manufacturer in the world per capita and Slovenia's economy is even bit better I think.

"Just be nice to people man, everyone's going through a crazy experience and even if you're not a good person, you can still be a nice person? Does that make sense? Life is one giant artistic orgasm flowing through everything and the fact we cant understand it is infinitely entertaining and frustrating in the most intoxicating way and it's basically just a giant conduit of energy, for some people it's too intense, some people can tap into it in really intimate ways but I think that our perception of ""life"" is probably a fraction of what's ""really"" going on"
"This is bullshit. People who are in comas for a few weeks, even a few days will have recovery periods that can last months and years. Most Coma patients have to learn how to walk and talk and eat again. Laying flat for years, even if nurses move your muscles for you, will ravage your muscles.  You don't come out of a 3 year coma just feeling a little stiff. A 3 year coma is something that you see on the news and in record books. "
I'd imagine being lost in a crowd would be pretty stressful for you since you would have a hard time finding the people you are actually with.

"My elder brother is a high-functioning autistic, we used to be close when we were kids, in high school I started to get annoyed with him but we were still on ok terms. He has stopped talking to me for the past 5-6 years. I have always been nice to him, and very encouraging and ensured my parents to let him learn programming like, almost a decade ago. I knew he liked that and would've probably flourished. My mom refused to let him do game design, but I tried to talk her into it. I praised his weight loss (all my life I've scolded people who have said that he's fat or acted remotely bullying to him). I bought him all his favourite books which he accepts. He wrecked my car and he knows that I know, but I paid to fix it anyway.

He also doesn't speak to a younger brother, but he's on talking terms with the rest. My mom has given up on trying to get him to respond to me, my husband says that's just how he is, everyone is different. 

Can you remotely explain if certain people tick you off? And if they do, what's the best way to remedy it. I think he is calmer now and definitely more confident after his weight loss, believe me I'm more than elated. I just don't understand why he's stopped responding. (He's 31 this year)"
"Take this advice or leave it. I will give you my experience. I had a well paying job, then I went on to cofound a company that was acquired to a very large adtech company last year. Like you I haven‚Äôt founded any startup before then. What happened is:

1- things are way harder than they look at the beginning

2-things are a lot more expensive than you plan for

3- you will not be funded quickly

4- plan on working without any income for a long time

5- it is going to be emotionally and physically abusing experience

6- once your company makes it and it is acquired, it honestly doesn‚Äôt feel as good as what people think (even though it sells for $$$$$$)


Personally I was lucky that I got my money back and a lot more. However, in the process I managed to lose my apartment, fancy car, relationship, most of my friends and family and of course went broke.


I am still working in startups, and I don‚Äôt see myself working for a big entity now. However, I feel it is my obligation to tell you what you are going to face based on my experience "
