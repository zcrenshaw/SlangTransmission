I'm as good as Donald Trump is at being the President of the United States. 
What’s you’re favourite memory of 2017?
If you were gonna orchestrate the next school shooting where in the US would you like to strike?
Throw it in the nearest trash can. We can’t keep polluting the earth.
Maine. There’s so many nice people up there. 
"I don’t have a question, but I’ve been reading this thread and you sound like a really cool and funny dude. Thanks for starting up an AMA about this subject"
"Dude I have never thought of that in 20 years, that's genius, thx!"
The Vegas shooting.
I don't know what is up with everyone basically condoning this man's actions because it taught you a lesson. It was not okay. I seriously hope these people are never wronged because apparently they think it would be fine to just have an insane sexual punishment to fix the problem. I am so sorry this happened to you and so glad you're able to share it somewhere. I hope you're friend have been more supportive than these commenters. And I hope you are healing from this abuse. 
"Anything that has to do with sexual assault, especially on a child"
"I don’t know how he was as a person, but I really appreciate his work."
What kind of crime should be legal?
"I mean, I guess the advantage is anyone could deep throat you ;)"
"Medium rare, and covered in sautéed peppers and onions. I also want it to be juicy."
How do you like your child?
What would you do if you found an abandoned baby? 
"Because he’s the 

#  # ALMIGHTY BEACON OF ENLIGHTENMENT "
What do you think of Adolf Hitler and his impact on the world?
"I kick it as hard as I can, to let out the repressed anger I have from my childhood"
"As someone who works in law enforcement, I am really of two minds about this and I'm going to be blunt;

First, I think it's absolutely foolish of you to do this, because a) it is dangerous, and one day someone could easily pull a gun on you and end your life, especially since you are confronting them with something that leaves them in a corner. b) You are not a trained law enforcement individual, so you open yourself up to a slew of things (potential charges towards yourself, civil suit, etc.) and c) I have trouble believing you do this out of the greatness of your own heart, as opposed to wanting to brag about your exploits later on (as in this post, or im certain, when you talk about it at parties.

On the other hand (and I'll know who bothered to read to this point by the replies...), I think it's wonderful that people are looking out for the kids in this world full of predators, and that your intentions mean well. I hope that these types of actions will make someone think twice about moving forward with this type of fantasy, and second, I know police need hard proof to convict someone, and sometimes criminals get off easy on technicalities, which you don't have to worry about it.

I'm really unsure of how to feel about it...I think if I knew more of your work, and could see your process, and if I thought it was solid, I'd be okay with it, and I also HIGHLY respect the fact that you don't publish it online, mostly because I feel that the groups who do, simply want the notoriety.

I mean, once you've confronted the guy, he's obviously learned a lesson, and even better if the police are informed. But I feel like those who publish the videos are ruining individuals lives, without them being proved guilty in a court of law. I know it's easy to point at the chats as proof, but there is a reason we have the rule of law (this type of scenario does not allow for someone to show up and change their minds, it immediately paints them as guilty, and I believe in the rule of law, else we have vigilantes everywhere!)

I think my TL/DR would be - good job stopping the actual predators, but be very careful, you are opening yourself up to a ton of potential dangers and consequences that the police are trained for, despite your best intentions.

One question - is this in the US? I would't do this in the US, just because of the prevalence of firearms...confronting the wrong person could easily end your life."
"I never had sex in terms of penetrating someone. I had a girlfriend 2 years ago and we just rubbed each other's body with clothes, we broke up not long after that (that was my only experience). I don't really plan on penetrating anybody, it's not really a thing for me, although I'm up for trying different things in the future. "
"God I hope so, that would be so funny. Although I believe as a baby I had a normal sized penis, the thing is it just doesn't grown as a normal one. "
Upon seeing a child with mental disabilities you?
What type of car do you drive? 
you fuckin sharks or something?
"That's genius mate haha I drive a small car, but I woudn't want to compesate for my micropenis by driving a tank. I would be okay with a Subaru Impreza or a Nissam R34."
"I kind of just kept quiet, and they got worse over the years. I went to public school, and it was confusing at first. As a kid I believed anything my parents said, but once I got to middleschool i totally rebelled and thought my own way. They were mad, and we have a lot of arguments, but they don’t try to pester me about it now. "
"Got some good news mate, minimum 5cm to reach through the vagina, so you should be ok at penetration."
I sure hope she is.
"Yes, but I do it with the tip of my fingers, almost like rubbing it off like a girl does (which is kinda of harder in a way). Orgasm wise I believe I'm like every guy with a normal sized penis. 
"
7 cm when erect. That small. I believe it does classify as micropenis.
Honey I would do anything if you paid me enough.
Just got really paranoid and had to make sure my own penis was longer than that.
On a scale of 1-1000 how good is your other half at sex ? 
"Okay, I'm terrible."
Thank you so much for your comment! I really appreciate it!
Do you believe anne frank is dead?
"I’m open to suggestions on a bucket list though. I’ve already been skydiving. My goals so far:

- Get married to the love of my life (he’s been with me 5 1/2 years, and taken care of me through all of this. We’ve been friends for 11 years, and he’s the most amazing man on the planet). 

- Go to Hawaii with my friends and family

- Write a book about this crazy experience (I have a blog if you’re interested. Cancerouskelly.tumblr.com)

- Travel out of the country (I never have!) 

- Take a few weeks to go on a cross country road trip with my fiancé and our daughter and visit out of state relatives and friends! (If you live in the US and wouldn’t mind us crashing on your floor, let me know!) "
"A guy who turned out to be a (relatively unknown) local politician. 40 years old, he said he wanted to pick me up after school and pretend to be my father, then take me home and force me to drink his cum after sex. It made the news and he publicly resigned from his position. No, it's not a job, I do this voluntarily."
Not enough
It’s finger lickin good
"I believe I'm not, I also do not have enough girth for condoms, even the extra small ones. "
Have you ever had sex? Do you plan to?
"I would tell them that although I know how frustrating, saddening, and exhausting it is to have to put up with these insane, polar beliefs, you should not let them deter you. Don’t let them gaslight you, or shame you for what you believe, because the reality is, you’re not in the wrong. A lot of people dealing with delusional parents may be worried for their mental health, which is a very valid concern. One I struggle with a lot. Parental figures that show signs of paranoia, distrust, anxiety, and literal insane behaviors is a scary and tough thing to deal with, and there’s not a whole lot you as an individual can do. I would say the most important thing is being open to discussion a lot, without being accusatory or defensive. Even if it doesn’t change anything necessarily, it can help them be open to more accepted concepts. "
"As someone who has sat at thanksgiving dinner trying to explain Obama is a citizen and now sees a stupid red hat on top of my fathers head every time I visit, I can relate.  At some point you have to agree to disagree and move on.

Best of luck to you."
Roofie?
"They reluctantly vaccinated me because I really wanted to do sports. However, my parents now want me to stop seeing an actual doctor and instead go to a homeopathic doctor, which is scary for me because I rely on Prozac. They’ve tried getting me to take his Brain Force +, but i have no idea what’s in that shit, so I just say I will  and never do.  "

"I made her an email address and I’ve been writing her emails. They usually start with “for your 13th birthday” (she’s 11 now), or “when you get your heart broken,” or “when your best friend dumps you,” etc. They go all the way to age 25 and include her wedding, the birth of her first baby, and all that. 

I write letters to Sam via email too. But he reads them in real time. They’re sort of like love letters. But I’m also writing a book, and he hasn’t read that yet. 

I have a blog with a lot of letters to Sam.

"I just wanted to say that it is absolutely NOT your fault that this happened. You may have vandalised this guys place but he totally took advantage of a young, impressionable foreign boy. HE is in the wrong. You may have made a mistake but it wasnt warranted. 
I feel so bad for you! Has this had any lasting implications on you? "
How many people do you poison with cyanide every month?
The sound of my dad crying.
Can’t pound with that for sure 
"It’s so bad for you, but god damn does it feel good to eat it."
Would you support and execute a second holocaust?
Are you able to masturbate and achieve orgasm?
"One close friend knows about it because he used to complain about his normal sized penis all the time, so I told him. I realized when I was about 8 or 9, at the school bathroom - I looked down to my friend while we were peeing and his cock was so much bigger than mine it genuinely 
scared me. I started to look at other guys and confirmed I was the one with a problem (although, at that time I didn't really realize what it really meant)."
"In your experience, What's the most effective way to seduce a woman?"
I would. 
"how did schooling work with school telling you science and your parents trying to reverse it at home? I'd be pretty confused. Or were you homeschooled maybe?
Do they try and force their beliefs on you, or have they given up on converting you like you have them?"
"6, and my dad"
"To gain control over the people, essentially. It doesn’t really make sense to me, but they think it’s apart of a plan to create a new world order "
How small exactly? 
"At birth did the labor delivery nurse and your parents believe you to be a female because your penis was so small, like in a bad comedy?"
It’s like talking to a brick wall. My mom is extremely ignorant and can’t back up her logic and my dad is very angry and defensive 
&gt; implying it'll reach the throat
It’s not my first choice.
What sound do you strive to hear daily? 
"Thanks dude, I never really thought it could actually go inside, I'll keep in mind if the situation comes."
"How many one night stands have you had and who was the most ""gifted""?"

Ouch"
What are your thoughts on eating human flesh?
Please send help. I don’t wanna be here. There’s no button on the desk. 
"Absolutely not lol! I’m pretty liberal, want to work for the federal government, and believe in science. I’m as much of a ~~product of the zionist globalists~~ different being as it gets. "
Well none of us would exist if our grandmothers didn't fuck somebody...
"Thank you! I’m hopeful but realistic. I read the odds and understand them, but no one can really be put into categories that way. That data is 5 years old, and the chemo I had this last time only became available in the last 2 years. I’m younger than a lot of women who get this. I’m strong enough to take the rough stuff. All that factors in, so I’m hopeful about my chances. "
Stay strong Barron and how is life in the White House vs Trump Tower?

What do you think of having people of different race living in your neighborhood?

I hope it is my friend. 
"Just googled it, its 2,75 inches"
"Nowadays I'm chubby because I'm not looking out for my body and I have the shittiest metabolism in the world, although I've been on my 'recommended weight' for about 2 periods of my life and it didn't change 1% of the size.  I actually got surprised the last time I got fit, because I really thought it would make a difference."
"I mean, I would do it, if the situation called for it, and depending on who it was with. But I'm not a penetration kinda of guy, I'd rather be the one being penetrated if you know what I mean."
"I once moved to a very big and expensive school here in my city. There, after gym classes everybody would shower (it was the school rules), so I basically had to sneak out of every class or sometimes just skip it enterily. I managed to finish the year without showering there once. 
I've also experienced mean comments of friends at school while peeing so I started doing in in the toilet instead of the mictory. 
There was once a time where boys at school were playing of hurting one another in the penis/balls. I was paranoid every day at school because the first time I got pranked the kid told me, 'dude, you have no cock?'."
Got nothing to ask but something to tell. As i read your story i got depressed but as i can see you are not depressed. Not at all compared to your situation so you are probably much more powerful and realistic than most of us. So please do not give damn about statistics cause i am pretty sure you cannot be killed by a dumbass disease. I wish you a long happy life with your family.
"Maybe like 10,000? I would get tired after that, it takes a lot of energy, yknow?"
What's your favorite part about having a pet?
What do they believe the government's (or whoever's) reason is for lying about flat earth stuff?
"you should watch Hot Girls Wanted on netflix, they portray the darker side to the industry and interviews with family members"
The kid went through sexual trauma and you're worried about if he learned his lesson about vandalism? 
You seem to have an incredibly level head on your shoulders and sound very mature for your age. Keep going with this attitude and outlook. It will get you far. 
"sometimes right near the entrance feels the best, you're in luck!"
"Firstly, thanks for your comment. No, this is not in the US, and carrying weapons here is illegal. I am fully aware of the fact that what I do is very dangerous, and I am always extremely careful, as I've said in other answers, I choose crowded areas to avoid violent reactions and I ask a couple of friends to come if I suspect that the man is dangerous. No, I don't do this to brag about it. Only a handful of close friends and family members know. In fact, I made a new reddit account just to make this post, because I don't want people who know what my actual username is to find it. "
He confessed that he felt the same and that he had regretted saying that we would be better off as friends all those years ago. Although I am happy that he did as I think the timing is better this way as we are older and have a solid friendship. We got together last March and I've never been happier! :) It was the best thing I ever did and the easiest relationship ever as it felt so natural. You're story is very heart warming happy it all worked out for you!
Are you big enough to penetrate some one?
I think I'd rather have OP's penis than your personality. 
"If you got dropped in new Zealand with an industrial sized tub of lube, how many sheep do you think you could rape?"
What sort of weight are you? Sometimes when men are overweight their penis get a bit buried under their fat. I just wondered if this had something to do with it or not.
At a family reunion. 
"Not sure if you're just joking, but if you're in the same boat as OP definitely don't consider that an impossibility. If a woman decides she likes you then insecurities surrounding a small, even very small, penis are more likely to push her away than the small penis itself. Being secure enough to satisfy a woman in whatever way works for her will always be attractive. "
"It wasn't worth being victimized, stripped and sexually taken advantage of. "

What's the one thing you'd never bring into your married life?
"I really don't know the answer of that. I don't know if they knew about, if they just thought it was going to grow eventually or if they expected me to talk to them about it."
This answer could be good or bad depending on who you ask. 
"This is actually a very good and complex question for me. I got only one real experience of dating a girl (which was bad all the way throughout) and after a moment of very intense and kinky kissing and rubbing I realized if I were to stay with her, we would eventually - very soon - be having real sex, so I was planning talk to her. Unfortunately (actually not), we broke up so that never happened.
If for some reason I would date a girl again (which I find hard to believe), I would try to talk to her as soon as I could handle it. I wouldn't want to be in her position of finding out her boyfriend not only has almost no penis, but he also doesn't want to put what he has inside of you. Same would go for guys, I would just try to talk before hand what sex would be like - that said, this 'conversation' would be very very difficult for me since I never really had the chance of doing it and I'm very shy about this in real life."
Seriously?? You are telling this poor MINOR child it was payback for vandalism???? He never deserved this!! Would you all treat him like this if it was your 15yo daughter or sister?? He was preyed on by an ADULT.
