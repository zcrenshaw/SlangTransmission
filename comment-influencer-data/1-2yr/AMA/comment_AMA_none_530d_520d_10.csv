"Put a backpack on her when you put her to bed, will stop her potentially rolling onto her back and choking on vomit"
"We met in college. It was about 6 months into the relationship when I began to notice things were a little weird. She would constantly text me, asking when I’d be home, where I was, what I was doing. When I was home, she’d follow me all over the house and basically couldn’t handle being apart from me for extended periods of time.  She also would constantly hound me for sex, often at inconvenient times. At first it just seemed like normal clingy-ness that was only a little annoying, but as time went on it became more clear to me that it was a bit more serious. One night when I was very tired and not in the mood, she refused to take no for an answer. Eventually she just climbed on top of me and started to rape me. I struggled but she worked out a lot and was quite a bit stronger than me, so I had no choice but to lay there and take it. When it was over, I left my apartment and spent the night at my friend’s place. In the morning, I filed a police report and she confessed to everything. I eventually got a restraining order in place, which she thankfully never violated. About a month later, she got ahold of me and told me about her diagnosis and apologized to me. That was a couple years ago, I haven’t heard from her since."
"I ran into “men can’t get raped” a lot, and it was extremely frustrating. Once they realized I had actually been effected by it, my friends and family became more supportive. But it’s a very lonely feeling: to go through something like that and have your loved ones laugh and shrug it off when you tell them about it."
"She really didn't like the way I ran the office. We had to choose a new health care plan and I let another employee take charge of that project. She wasn't very happy about it. She wouldn't even attend little award shows I would put on for my people so they can feel good about working. I guess she didn't want to see that corporate sanctioned such events and didn't want to pay for it.

Then some rumors about our CFO sleeping with his secretary prompted more sexual harassment training where I had to ""retire"" my jokes that I thought lifted the sprits of those I was in charge of.

Once, I had to fire someone to reduce overhead and she wasn't happy that I took way to long. Look, I've worked for these people for years and, in some ways, I'm like their dad and they are my children. How can you fire your children?!

During an important meeting with a very important client, I found out that she was recently divorced and started drinking heavily at Chili's. She wasn't thrilled at my ability to connect with our important client until he agrees to renew his contract with us. I guess she changed her tune because she started to kiss me in the parking lot of Chili's and mentioned that she was staying at a local hotel. So, I went to take her back and well, needless to say, I think I was Mr. Rebound. I didn't mind though as I was helping a friend, a fellow co-worker going through some tough times. By the way, I didn't put anything her drink like she thought.

I was so thrilled that I connected with her in such a way that I told the entire office what happened. She was not happy at all and decided to do my performance review over the phone instead of in person.

I dated this other woman for a bit, but she dumped me after Christmas. I guess my boss took pity on me and invited me to Jamaica. No one knew about it until I accidentally emailed a picture to the entire office showing me putting on sun tan lotion on her. It went ""viral"" in the office so it was official. I had to fill out one of those love contracts from HR. 

It didn't last long though as my boss broke up with me right before I was going to interview for a big promotion at work. Turned out, I was interviewing for her job! She found out, yelled at our CFO and threaten to sue the company.

She eventually moved into my condo with me and started making candles.

"Were your friends supportive? I know a lot of people find themselves in the ""you can't rape men"" camp, which I find annoying enough without a personal history of it."
Shabooya roll call? Which episode
"I knew I had mild colorblindness growing up, but I always underestimated it.  Biggest impact it had on me was not knowing I was driving a purple truck for  3 years (because the registration said blue when I got it). Welcome to the party, the very drab decored party. "
"Honestly, I'm not sure. We were at a very harmless club that we've been to many times where everyone knows everyone, she walked off with a friend and 30 mins later I found her completely incoherent in a corner. "
He was my husband...

"First of all, wow. Second, I’m sorry you had to go through that. "
That is actually such solid advice. 
"Definitely ignored. I grew up partly in Oklahom and my Oklahoma history class contained very little Native history. The class asked questions such as “Do they still live in tee-pees?” and “They smoked weed out of peace pipes right??” 

We’re stereotyped as alcoholics, casino owners, and moochers. When people think of Indian they think of vastly different things than what I think of. 

But most of my one on one interactions are respectful and full of understanding. "
The finale
"Ah, Central America. Truly a bastion of peace and prosperity."
"Haha, I’m not sure. It’s a great place a lot of the time but not a great place a lot of the time. It’s very weird to me though that a lot of Americans don’t know a lot about the first people who were here."
"Okay, background and basic history? How did this start? Initial situation? Initial warning signs? Leadup? In short: tell your story. 

Edit: if that’s too sensitive, just let me know. That’s fine. "

"Yeah OP, you gotta stop dropping these bread crumbs and then not elaborating. You’re killing us!

Edit: Too soon?"
"Yes, I was told that by several of my friends and my brother."
"I became a vegan from watching a family member and wanted to become really healthy. It was definitely a lifestyle change, expensive and time consuming. It can definitely benefit some peoples life but to me I was really starting to feel weak and tired, and I was getting all my nutrients too. It is not for everyone. I still continue to eat healthy and vegan meals but am not a dedicated vegan anymore. Also, my craving for meat was getting really bad. I craved it so much and no matter how much vegan food I ate, I was still hungry. Everyone is different and we should all respect what people want to eat and what makes them feel healthy and good. "

"A buddy of mine got really drunk at his house and woke up to his girlfriend's best friend raping him. It would be easy if she was a pig but she was actually really attractive. Of course nobody believed him and his girlfriend dumped him thinking he cheated. I had him call the police who basically laughed at him and asked if he seriously wanted to file a report. Only after she finally got arrested(never charged as far as we know) did anyone outside our friend group believe him. He got a restraining order but we still had to see the chick on campus. His gf tried to come back but it was too late, he no longer wanted to see her. He actually cut a lot of people out of his life due to this. I was always grateful for my conscious telling me to believe him at once and not question it or laugh at him. "
"What was your father like as a person? And in hindsight, were there any signs as to him being the kind of man he turned out to be?"

"Just FYI- you can’t renounce US citizenship until you have citizenship in another country. It typically takes at least 4-5 years to obtain citizenship in any given country, so it’s unlikely OP could renounce USC unless they already had citizenship in another country at the time they left the US. The process of renunciation usually takes at least 6mo- 1 year to process too."
"Jesus Christ, even leaving the government is a bureaucratic nightmare"
"So, I wouldn’t really have an issue with it if people who had any trace of Native in them made an effort to learn about their tribal history. But I feel that most people who say things like that are more than likely not Native haha. I just wish people would use it as an excuse to learn more about the culture rather than an excuse to seem exotic. 

I do not but I’ve frequently visited.  They’re much better in recent years than when I was a kid. They focus on sustainable living. But honestly, the conditions aren’t amazing. They’re apartments and small homes and they’re definitely not the worst. Reservations are often very isolated and there’s not hardly anything to do on them. 

Richer nations have better reservations, from what I’ve seen. "

Thank you. It was a pretty crazy thing to go through.
"No, I'm still a U.S. citizen. I'm technically just traveling. I'm on a tourist visa and have to leave the country every 90 days to renew. I've been doing that since June 2017. Although I enjoy the travel, it's starting to get really expensive. Mexico has 6 month visas so we'll probably head there next."
"i always have respect for people who say something and goes along to do it, especially if it involves a certain level of life changes.

"I haven’t had a life threatening situation as of yet but I have been made fully aware that it is more than possible.

I’ve had it for about 18 months. It came out of nowhere slowly and gradually believe it or not and I didn’t really notice all the signs.

I went for a walk with my partner and children one evening and I felt like I was on fire and itchy all of a sudden. I lifted my shirt up and I was literally covered in hives from my neck down.

I went home and it faded fairly quickly.

A week last or so and I had put it to the back of my mind and was eating an ice lolly. My lips must of tripled in size.

Where ever it affects me it burns like a burn from something hot - ironically. It is excruciating."
"Indians seems fine to me. Red skins is derogatory so I don’t like that. But I think that when someone names their mascot The Indians, they’re implying that the word Indian means strong/powerful/successful. Which is definitely what I think of when I hear Indian. 

Some people think that Indian is disrespectful to India Indians. But if your school is located in Indian territory it would seem appropriate to me.  "
"I was on a program aired on Channel 4 in the UK, called ‘how to lose your friends in 10 days’. It was part of a series of programmes called ‘Gay to Z’, focussed on LGBT stuff.

It was very short, filmed over the course of a week or so. A gay lad from Kent had some old school friends who were all straight, and although they were tolerant he felt like he couldn’t really be himself around them. He came to Brighton for the show and met up with (3 I think) groups of friends that he had to choose to spend the week with, and he chose my group. 

The producers did say that they wanted him to choose us, I don’t know much they influenced his choice.

He spent the week getting makeovers, spending time with us at bbq’s and nights out etc. Very little of the dialogue was contrived at all, I think there was maybe one time where I said something off camera and they decided they liked it so asked me to say it again while they were filming.

In the end he chose between us and his old friends (basic premise of the programme - bit weird!) and he chose us. I didn’t really keep in touch with him but I think one of the other guys did. He was a nice lad.

The whole experience was pretty fun and odd. Didn’t get paid for it at all but lunches, dinners etc. were paid for and they would slip us some money to go and grab lunch which would inevitably go towards BOGOF jugs of cocktail at a local gay bar. Good times."
I slept with mine before I got married. I was working for another company and he recruited me to his. We were banging at that point. He made me work harder then everyone else. Then another manager caught wind and blew our cover. He ended up getting fired..and I switched departments. The end.

"I’m 1/2 Cherokee and 1/2 Choctaw (: 

When I was a kid it was the Little People. They were these little people that lived in the woods, adults couldn’t see them only children. They welcomed you into the woods to play and were generally friendly. If you got lost, they would guide you out. If you were hurt, they would heal you. 

But they were evil! If you took anything from the woods they would follow you home and kill you. If you were an adult they’d taunt you and try to cause you harm. 

I used to swear I could see them and I was terrified of playing in the woods lol. "

"First time was simply importing cacti, I was ordering quite a lot back in the day, before the government clamped down on it.  It was all personal and I did not sell anything.

My packages where opened by customs before when I was living in a nice middle class area. Though when I moved to a more run down place, they intercepted and raided my house, over 4KG of cacti chips.

I had a lab in storage, but nothing illegal, they tried to bust me for manufacture, it took about three years on bail. In the end all charges where dropped and I was free to go. I was lucky my computer was encrypted and they couldn't access it, pissed them of when I told them where to go when asked for my password.

Second time, they illegally raided my flat, because someone else in the apartment complex was smoking cannabis. Im pretty carefull and I dont tell anyone what Im doing, anyway this time I was caught red handed manufacturing DMT.

This took three years and the end result was a small fine and suspended sentence for 11 months. Which was weird since I was caught with 10g of pure crystal DMT, but I`m white so no jail or anything. I was free to smoke cannabis within my probation time, though if caught I would of gone to jail. I wasnt tested not did I have to report to anyone, I was pretty much a free person.

The court thing was horrible though and not something I liked at all."
Obsessive Love Disorder and Hypersexuality
"I was the assistant manager and her my direct manager. We worked closely together, especially in inventory. 

The first time I got a big hint was when she told me she dreamt of us having sex. The next day she gave me what I would say is a ""sexy hug"". Think hugging someone low and raising up with her breasts tight against me. 

We were doing inventory and the tension was high and we made out. Weeks go past with us secretly dating til it came out. One of us had to be transferred to another location. She offered but they had me do it. Luckily a management position was open at that location and I was next in line for promotion anyways. So indirectly I got promoted by dating my boss. Still going 6 years later"

"&gt;I'm receiving a lot of questions that can be answered with the following: ""After much thought and reflection, the root of my disappointment was not necessarily Trump himself (although he is repulsive). The fact that approximately 25% of Americans went to the polls and voted for him (about half of registered Americans voted, and about half of those actually voted for Trump) was more disturbing. What does that say about my fellow Americans? At this point, I just see Trump as the representation of 25% of Americans. Is that something I want to surround myself and my family with? The answer is no, so off we went!

When you find a place where 25% of the people don't suck in one regard or another, let me know.

The asshats of the world are more or less evenly distributed, and they will always be with us.  What's different here is that some bad actors found a way to *organize* the asshats.  This phenomenon won't be confined to the US... not for long, anyway."
"Hm, this is a great question. If you can, visit a reservation. Attend a tribal holiday. Bring friends to these as well. Native people are very kind and we love teaching about our heritage. 

Creating an environment where we can share with people not of our culture is important. We also want to learn about other cultures! 

What would mean the world to me is seeing something like the Cherokee holiday get bigger. Attracting people from all over the state and surrounding states. It’s really a lot of fun and I would be thrilled to sit next to a melting pot of people as an Elder tells folklore. "

Feminists are firm believes that all genders can be victims/survivors of rape, sexual predatory behaviour, coercion and so on. Do your research. It's 2018, it's not to much to ask is it?"
"Just FYI- I’m pretty sure you might just be confusing a plain clothed LP with a secret shopper. I had a friend who was a “secret shopper” and her job entailed pretending to be a customer and, well, shopping. The secret being that she’s really undercover and working for a company writing reviews about retail establishments. I could be wrong here though."
"I had my laser eye surgery roughly 12 years ago. The treatment variant I had was PRK - unlike more common LASIK where incision is made in the cornea to create a ‘flap’, and actual corrective laser work is covered by that flap, in PRK the laser treatment is done on the surface of the cornea. It extends the healing/recovery time significantly, but also reduces some of the risks. 

The procedure itself was painless and fascinatingly trivial. I laid back in the comfy chair, got some medication eyedrops and was told to “look at the red dot”. Things got blurry as the laser kicked in, and I’ll admit there was some rather unpleasant ‘organic burning’ smell, but not much. Then they rinsed out the eye and I suddenly had crystal clear vision. 

I had no problems or complications post -procedure and my outcome was a bit better than 20/20 - now, 12 years later, my eyes are back to 20/20"

"If you meet a feminist who isn't for equal rights, or a TERF, they're not a feminist, they're a misandrist. Huge difference, my guy"
I actually think a lot of proclaimed feminists are fully in support of the issue of male rape. I agree though that the feminist label has been tinted by extremists and many should just use the egalitarian label instead.
"Omg no I’m curious about your culture!! I’ve read so much about the indigenous people of NZ. There’s such a rich history there. 

My childhood was very... spiritual. I learned a lot about the earth, superstitions, farming. I grew up singing songs in Cherokee and playing with dolls that I sewed myself. I thought every child ran around barefoot through the woods, had a bag around their neck with their birth cord in it, only ate meat if it was blessed. 
I didn’t know that non-native people really existed. But I found them to be very loud and not have a good understanding of personal space. Most didn’t see the Earth as a spirit that you need to respect. There’s a lot of things tho. 

When I was really little it made me feel special and princess-like. I got to travel a lot and visit many other tribes and it was like a whole adventure. When I got olde I realized that being chief was just politics and it wasn’t nearly as whimsical as I thought it was. My dad honestly spent a good majority of his time dealing with casinos and regulations. 

My culture is so important to me that it brings me to tears thinking about it. It’s my whole identity and the most important part of me. It’s important for me to talk about it and teach people about it. It’s important for me to revisit things I learned as a kid because I think I had the purest understanding of a lot of my native beliefs back then. "

OP this is how proof works. You take a selfie with a piece of paper. In the picture is your face, and on the paper is your Reddit username. Not a pic of someone's license, and not a pic of a pic of Gore and his dad.

I'm one of the guys who realized OP is a complete charlatan. What sparked it is he didn't know who waterfield was in relation to his dad. Well, waterfield is Gore's cousin. A fact I don't believe for a second would be lost on the killers son.

&gt;yeah the OP is a fraud, he's NOT the son of David Gore the serial killer.

&gt;I just did a google search for Michael Alan Gore vero beach FL and it turns out the real Michael Alan Gore was arrested for raping some kid/teenager, and the self pic the person claiming to be him posted is not of the actual Michael Alan Gore.

&gt;Also the driver's license picture and the picture of the picture of the actual Michael Allen Gore could easily be faked or found via google.

edit 3: Regardless of who he says he is, is true or not. Here is his criminal record. This is the scumbag we are possibly talking to. **A child molester.**

You answered your own question in the title. It’s The Office
"I wasn’t involved in the show at all but I saw some of it being filmed. An episode of “Big Ang”, was being filmed at some little outdoor bar/restaurant. A few of the women on the show were sitting together. When the camera wasn’t rolling they all sat and talked and laughed. As soon as the scene started they’d all yell at eachother. Then cut. Go back to talking and laughing. Then do a couple of takes of yelling. So yeah. Prettt fake. "

Your question is a bit amusing from my perspective...! 

I speak with an Indigenous Elder at work regularly. In Canada, the government just made a push to use the word Indigenous, so I asked him about it - what did he prefer?

He thought for a second, and then said ""Indian, Native, Indigenous...I don't care. It always seems to be mostly the white men arguing about what to call us...I'd prefer they just use my name"" he said laughing.

I couldn't help but think of his comment when I read your question."

And this is exactly what I despise about the left so much.

You have this ridiculous notion that who someone votes for solely determines whether they're a racist or not. You deal in ridiculously extreme levels of identity politics, as if every single person who voted for Trump is automatically a neo-nazi.

I know several Mexicans who actually voted for Trump because of his policies and because he actually paid attention to their state while Hilary didn't"
"It’s because you associate sex as an award.  At least you did twice in your post.


Being on the other end of that is exhausting.  Any gesture or thing that happens can be read as “is he/she just doing this to get laid?”  I’m not saying it’s an intentional feeling or one your wife wants to have, but when you’ve made that association, it’s hard to not want to read into things.  As soon as this pressure is off of her she’ll go back to being the person you fell in love with.  I’d bet she feels claustrophobic, because sex isn’t about getting something, it’s about sharing something."
"Walter White, is that you?"
"While I applaud you for following through on youe word, it's baffling that you would condemn millions of people, many of whom I'm sure you haven't so much as seen, much less had an extensive conversation with them. It's unfair to them. If a person is truly good, or virtuous, then their political beliefs are not relevant.


Most of those who voted Trump were desperate, desperate for a change. I, for example, was not able to vote but I supported Bernie Sanders before Trump. Many Bernie supporters went on to support Trump in the race. The fact is that the 2016 election was scary, the 2010s have been scary. It's like the aftermath of 2008 and 2012, and we're still clearing up the rubble. The last ten years have been an absolute shitshow, and everyone is tired. Surely, you can sympathize with desperation, as someone who moved out of the country due to such an inclination? I'd think you'd be able to.


I'm glad you're happy, but please don't ruthlessly condemn people who weren't happy, the people who hated both Trump and Hillary but felt that they had to vote for the ""lesser of two evils"". You don't know them. Additionally, the president doesn't have anywhere near as much power as we think he does. The president is heralded in American society as somehow being the equivalent of a position in a monarchy, when this is simply not the case. 


With that being said, I personally fail to see why you'd move out of the country just because a new idiot is thrown into office. As well as a broad, unfounded judgment of character which you have cast upon millions of desperate and hopeless people. You're only one of them. You've done what you've had to do, I hold no ill will towards you for that. I don't know you. Millions of Americans did precisely what they felt they had to do on that fateful November day, please refrain from joining the herd mentality and holding them in contempt. It's wrong and divisive. "
"So funny story.  My older brother who is colorblind and a 5th grade teacher tried to demonstrate how prevalent colorblindness is by showing them this. (So as not to be cruel it says: fuck the colorblind) my brother , being colorblind had no idea and had to have an awkward conversation w the principal about what he had inadvertently done.  https://i.imgur.com/pPoKOHz.jpg "

" I did heroin for about six months. I started out by smoking it and it didn't take long to graduate to shooting it. I didn't particularly like it, to be honest. I liked the rituals about it more than the high. I liked the act of smoking and the entire process of shooting up. 

The high, for me, was that it would numb all of my pain, make me drowsy, and nauseas. My girlfriend at the time seemed to get a burst of energy from it and would want to go out and do things. I would just pass out.

We were both addicts before we started heroin so it only added to our addiction. 

I ended up in rehab because of it. She ended up dead. 

If you're considering using heroin, just know this. Heroin kills people. It doesn't matter how much you think you know about it or yourself, it will kill you if you can't stop."
Unfortunately we live in a society that treats men as expendable.

"Hello! I just have two questions that I feel like you could best answer.

1. How do you personally feel about people saying “my ancestor was Cherokee/Native American” even though they’re like 95% non Native American? How does the general community feel about this?

2. Do you live on the reservation? If so how are the living conditions there? I ask as I read a book recently on the conditions there and it was extremely depressing to hear. (Even if you don’t live on one currently, do you still know how it’s like?)"
I have been an extra on two Amish based reality TV shows.  One as a Mennonite gangster and one as a wild party animal Mennonite.  It was a blast!  My keg stand was a keg of root beer which was funny.  My favorite aspect was that I got to destroy an isle of food in a grocery store and they payed for any damages!  It was like a Beastie Boys video.  I am not a Mennonite at all by the way and I improvised all of my dialogue.
"A bit of a sour start, my fish died, but I'm starting my job at an antique shop today. It's around 11:30 where I am. Thanks for asking."

Good bot
what in the actual fyuck
I played whats new pussy cat over the intercom 7 times then one play of its not unusual then whats new pussy cat 7 more times 
How does it feel to be that lucky?
How badly do you react when exposed? Life threatening? 
"Lol your kids have the upper hand now. I hope they’re not old enough yet to realize what power they have over you. “Turn that game off, it’s time for bed!” “What was that, turn the heat off?” "
"Tbh it makes sense, you can't just become a complete non-citizen and it's not super easy to just become a citizen of another country for the same reason it isn't super easy to become a US citizen. No one wants to just take in a citizen who will abandon their home country on a whim just because they didn't like the most recent election. You need to prove that you have reason to become a citizen and that the country has reason to want to take you in as a citizen, those reasons can be more out of charity like in the case of refugees, but just disliking the most recent president us far from enough reason to justify something like that. "
I like to think I saw them. They looked like gnomes but without pointy hats. Bark-like skin. They wave at you as you pass. They seem jolly. 
Are you a user yourself? 
"Yes, I filed a report and she confessed to it."
That is actually fucking genius.

"I wasnt on Shark Tank but from what ive read just being on their will increase your profits by a huge amount due to free advertising.

Not all deals made on the show goes through since they find out some people lied about numbers or something.

Also someones presentation is usually like 1 yo 2 hours and they cut most of that into only like 15 mins that they show you. There are a lot of arguments and bad language that happens that even the person presenting cant believe it but they dont show most of it from what ive read."
"When I started to become weak and tired and I felt like I was missing out on life too. Like when my friends wanted to try a new restaurant and I missed foods that made me happy. Plus, I missed my hispanic cuisine so much!! I also was having super strong meat cravings which was weird because I was not even a meat person to begin with."
"Shitty families suck. You don't have to associate with them anymore.

My uncle strangled me when I was ten and nearly killed me. Same thing ... never mention it again.

I moved out as soon as I turned 18 and cut off that half of the family completely. I have never regretted it. That was 28 years ago. 

Take care of yourself. You deserve better. "
"Hi, it seems like you are doing well and that is good. I have found that the more I talk about it, the easier it becomes. Not to police, but friends and people I meet. It is nothing to be ashamed of, even if it is horrible and unfortunate. 
Maybe later on try finding a professional who deals with sexual abuse survivors and work it out a bit. 
Anyway, I hope this helped you and wish you all the best :)"
Omg do you still speak to your parents
"Hope she is OK.

I've had my drink spiked by accident. It was awful. I'm a tall guy with a fast metabolism, if it was a small female, things would have been much worse. 

It happened when I was at a bar with a female friend, she was drinking beer and I was drinking wine. We think that someone must have spiked the glass of wine as they assumed my friend (a girl) was drinking wine, not me."

"I find this particularly useful with Indica strains. I have a very difficult time falling asleep (I developed anxiety/depression from military/police work). Indica products make me feel tired and allow me to fall asleep easier. However, overuse can make your REM sleep disrupted from what I've read."
"Being legally blind doesn’t mean you see complete darkness or something similar. I used to think that too. I can only see right in front of my face and even then it’s bad vision and I get ghost images and black spots.

"The older you are, the worse. A lot of teens are open to gay people, I personally have some homo- and bisexual friends, but we are a minority of the population. There's a lot of homophobic people in Russia, partly because of how badly educated the populace is, partly because of propoganda. It's not life-threatningly dangerous, unless you are well-known in media"
"She agreed to a restraining order, in exchange for me not pressing criminal charges. She was held at the police station for a little while."
She seemed genuinely remorseful and I just wanted to forget about the whole thing. The restraining order seemed like the quickest and easiest way to never have to see her again.
My brothers ex fiancée can answer this one if she’s on here..
"There's no solid opinion on Trump, because that's foreign politics and only a small portion of young people know English and/or have interest in that.

Opinion on Putin varies wildly. I estimate, that the more educated and grown-up as people teenagers are, the less they think of him."
"Haven't heard abour mass shootings here for a while now. Very loud and stupid suicides maybe, but no match for US. 

Crime is kinda everywhere and nowhere at the same time, very hard to explain. Everyone knows someone who's been to prison in two handshakes and it's really easy to bump into a bunch of thugs, but it seems like nothing very serious happens. I, at least, have almost never heard of a hostage situation anywhere in my town, which is the second largest.

There's general negativity towards US in both media and populace. I try to awoid Russian media, so I don't know what the situation is, exactly."

"These formative years of my son’s life will shape the foundation of who he is. What I’m doing is exposing him to a wider world view; not teaching him to run away from tough situations. My life experiences tell me that what is best for my son right now is to expose him to different cultures, languages, and peoples. Once he establishes a solid belief system, then he will be able to use that as a compass to guide his actions - whether it’s to remove himself from toxic environments or be able to intelligently and compassionately change his environment.

"you said you moved to central america, uuuh why? I know you don't like Trump but America hasn't changed because of Trump. When Brexit happened I wanted to move out but I didn't because it's a waste of time and money"
