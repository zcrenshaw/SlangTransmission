"Yes, this is what true socialism looks like, don't let yourself be fooled when people say this isn't real socialism

"Why? You made $1999 more than most of us, congrats."
also i have a deep hate to commies and ignorant people that thinks that the URSS was something good and the rich people are the bad ones.. Socialism can only work in a country where the majority of the population is ignorant.

I wondered what I'd do with 15 Bitcoin worth 12 cents, so I did nothing.

Then Bitcoin starts taking off a bit. I try to find my login creds for the account. Can't get in at all. The account I used was before Gmail too, so it was local ISP account that I no longer have access to.

"As soon as I graduated nursing school I had 6 months before I was required to pay my loan back and before my interest for each loan kicked in. I used that time to live with my parents and saved as much as I could for 6 months before I moved out so I could have about 4 grand saved for emergency. 

Then Instead of paying the minimum requirement of my loan per month I payed $500/ month. With that I also had it in automatic payment because I read in details that if you have it set to automatic payment it will decrease the amount of interest rate that you owe in your loans. With my automatic payment I had it set to pay off the loan with the highest interest rate. As soon as each loan dropped to about $1000-2000 ( i normally had that saved up in my bank account) I would go ahead and pay off that loan and then changed the automatic payment to the next highest interest rate. I continued to cycle that every couple of months. Also every time I worked over time, when I got my tax refund, and or earned extra money I would pay it towards my loan and not keep it for my self. Then December came along and I had $5176 left in my loan. I had about 10K saved up ( 4K for emergencies) and decided to pay off the rest of my loan today. I wanted to pay off the rest so that way I can get as much as I can back during tax season. Rule of thumb before you invest in anything .. save up for emergency and then pay off your big debt. It definitely is a relief to have this out of my mind and now I'm saving up for downpayment to buy a house! "

"One of my best friends killed himself too. I was 17junior in highschool and he was 16. He experimented with acid just 1 time and I think he had a moment with personal issues regarding school and his parents. This is obviously all in hindsight cause I was just a high schooler. 

Anyhow he had mentioned 'going to do something ' before the school year ends and well he jumped off a clock tower that we visited beforehand. He climbs up there with a soccer ball and well texted me if I wanted to play soccer. This was a Sunday and I lied saying I was going to do some church activities with people.  He died from injuries sustained from the fall an hour later. I only found out later that night by driving past that clock tower cause it was lit up like a circus with police lights. I felt awful but no one could really sympathize. I had Asian parents that sent me to school the day after and I was just crying nonstop. Happened a week before my SATs. I fucked up my senior year and my freshmen college year and now I don't think I can pursue my studies tbh. 

It all started with a death of a friend. But you got to understand it's just a small moment in your life. Don't drag it around making it your future as well or you'll become like me. It's not even about trying to be a good person to your dead friend. I guarantee you'll regret it all trying to satisfy your personal needs( visiting your friends grave, talking to your dead friend's friend zone, visiting and looking for old pics and memories). It may work for some but I don't have the time or the money to be happy enough to be willing to visit my sad memories. There used to be yearly meets to have some friends group and meet together but after like 7 years it's just me. At this point what does it really mean to cherish a friend and memory if it's literally exhausting and killing you from inside? 

I don't have an answer but you can probably tell you don't want to be living my life. So my best advice is to get over it or fucking live your life in full dedication to this dead person. Sorry I don't want to be mean. Just don't waste your life like me is all I want to really inspire you to do."

"Not my AMA but I feel like the guy needs some help. 

I’ve never had to remove a human body from anywhere, however I once left a sandwich in my fridge while I was away for about 6 weeks. It was a last minute decision, I threw it in there with the intention of eating it before I left for the airport and never did. On my return I had to bin it, it had turned from turkey and mayo into a little gremlin type thing. Was pretty gross. "
" Wow... sure that was tough... i think war can't be compared to this, im glad to know that you're fine now :)

How unqualified are you?
"The problem with governmental intrusion in the market is that the government is ALWAYS staffed by bureaucrats who are rarely qualified, let alone the best and the brightest. Add to that the fact that under such monopolies, a lack of competition and the inevitable corruption that occurs under socialism and you get the same played out story... starvation, rampant poverty and institutionalized evil.

OP... I know it's worth nothing, but I feel sorry for you and your countrymen. Best of luck.

Since ends of 2014, im not eating 3 times a day like i used to...
Sometimes i eat twice in a day, sometimes once... sometimes i don't eat anything in the whole day, and is horrible...

Now it is around 6 USD per month and its getting worse, and the food price still the same."

"I’m trying to keep this AMA alive in op’s absence because it looked interesting. 

 To answer you, I’ve never had a weird encounter with a dead body, however my house overlooks a field and some woods. A few weeks ago at around two am lights started flashing through my window, dog was going crazy and I thought the aliens were coming for me.  I looked out the window to see what the extraterrestrials were up to and there was a light beam waving all through the woods. 

Turns out it was a guy walking his dog with a really cool torch, but for a moment I thought it was probe time. "

I've been picking up small projects and practical skills each week,  like working on our car, working around the house, etc. I'm also a student, undergoing my Master's in Counseling Psychology, so that keeps me a busy. 

On a separate note, and maybe tied to your question,  I've witnessed the detrimental effect on the psyche, the situation has had, and the results. I've had close relatives suffer from mental breakdowns to anxiety attacks. Even suicide has seen a spike, I really think the government should include the issue of mental health to their repertoire of problems to be dealt with."

This happened to me once many moons ago. I was promised a promotion if I moved and helped another location get back in line that had been struggling. Afterwards the hiring manager selected someone else from another location that was a less qualified person I think due to a VP playing games. I followed this advice and didn’t quit until I had another job. In the end it worked out better as I became wiser about such things and it was much more gratifying to quit because I had a job with that companies largest competitor rather than just quitting because I felt I got screwed

"well i am unemployed since a few weeks, but my life used to be, waking up in the morning, eating an ""arepa"" with ham and cheese, taking a bus to go to the work, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, and then when i get home sometimes i just sit on the computer and forget about taking a shower... and then taking a dinner and a shower, and going to sleep at 12:00 of midnight....
And the weekends were just for playing games, and sometimes going out with friends to do something different....

Everytime i steps the streets, i see starving people with not too bad clothes,  makes me think about how people that used to be like me is now looking for food at gargabe... sometimes i am afraid of end up there too....

"Back when bitcoin was something like $0.10-$0.25 each, I was considering buying $10 or $20 worth just to say I owned some. In all honesty, I definitely would have sold them when they were a couple hundred each (maybe earlier). 

There are all sorts of stories about people saying shit like “if I had bought some like I was thinking about, I’d have a billion dollars,” when in reality, they would not have held them this long.

Also, Bitcoin is solidly in tulip territory. It’s a digital currency that is being bought and sold almost exclusively as a speculative investment. A 66 year old retiree on my Facebook feed just made a post about how his friend convinced him to buy “this bitcoin thing.” Bitcoin has value, but nothing near what it’s trading at recently."

"All socialist governments become dictatorships.

I'd be interested to know if one can name an instance of socialism from the last 150 years in which an evil cunt wasn't able to wrestle the reins of power away from the masses and subsequently force their populations into starvation, forced labor and summary executions?

IMO, communism / socialism always purports to be utopia... when the environment doesn't match the ideal, it become a crime to even acknowledge the disparity. 

That's the true power of free markets and elections... competition and its self adjusting nature. "
