"Add to that we're in late November, she might be thinking of Christmas gifts and this could have been a pretty home run gift for an adult child."
"&gt;I sent him back some pictures of some rings I liked, and he blanched at them. He thinks they're too gaudy.

Her guy dislikes it. He doesn't want to buy a showy and tasteless ring for his fiancée. To do so says something about him and them as a couple. He's not alone, as many people think flaunting wealth and status is tasteless. 

Their value system is not in alignment and it needs to be talked out and addressed before moving forward."
"It’s absolutely not your SIL’s job to try and make *your* expectations of *her* new baby a reality. 

Your whole family’s approach is counterproductive.  If you keep pushing and being obnoxious, you’re likely to permanently damage the relationship between your family and your SIL, which means smaller chances of seeing the baby more regularly when the (tiring, exhausting, frequently miserable) newborn phase is over.

You guys need to be showing her that she can trust you to respect her and her wishes regarding the child that she carried, delivered, and is now doing the primary care for.  Think of it long-term: I know I’d never leave my children with someone who I thought wouldn’t respect my parenting choices.  You guys are just showing your SIL that you don’t respect hers.

Put it this way: your SIL is now the “matriarch” of *her family*, so what she says regarding her new baby goes, or ought to.

You can keep insisting that it’s “unfair” and likely hurt your chances of getting what you want, or you can politely back off and start rebuilding some trust.  Don’t make things worse."
"You need to let go, you can't control everything. I know that's really hard, but you can't control your mom or your inlaws *and that's ok.*

Your in laws aren't childeren who need to be protected and sheltered. They are adults who can make their own decisions be it going, not going, or leaving early if they get fed up.

You did your part, you communicated possible friction. Don't worry about how they feel after the fact. Just remind yourself they are adults who can, and should, figure out their boundaries and feelings on their own. You don't need to fix this. "
"All the evidence is there. He's been cheating on OP since they started their relationship. He has not agreed to monogamy, which was a condition of the relationship from OP's perspective. I understand that it's not the nicest thing to infer about someone but who said that relationship advice has to be 100% nice all the time?

See, this is the biggest problem with this sub now. Sometimes people need to hear the truth. This isn't even harsh truth. This is a realistic truth. OP's husband needed a visa so he married OP on a very short timeline. *Since the beginning* of their relationship OP's husband has been cheating when a condition of the relationship was monogamy.

I'm sorry, but it's not cruel or harsh. It's a likelihood."
sounds like she's going for a Friendsgiving and there are other people counting on her to be there. .. along with all the food she bought.
“No problem. You can pay me back for the food via my PayPal:  _______. “
"I’ve always slightly blamed myself for not knowing his family because when his family first found out he had a girlfriend they told him to invite me out to dinner a couple of times but on both occasions I declined because I used to have severe anxiety issues and I was worried I’d make a fool out of myself or that they wouldn’t like me and he’d stop dating me. 

That was way back when I was 14 though.. I really have no idea why I’m not allowed in his house but after all these responses I am growing concerned that he doesn’t want to increase the chances of his family slipping up and telling me about something/someone he’s hiding from me."
"I’ve only been to his house when they are on holiday and there’s no chance of them coming home. 

They are wealthy and his home is very nice. My mum actually is a hoarder and when we go to mine he complains that he gets pet hair on his clothes yet he’d still rather that than invite me to his. I’m just realising exactly how weird this all is now that I’m explaining everything to other people... it’s embarrassing. "
"&gt; Considering the circumstances, I think this is an oversimplification.

Sometimes oversimplifying lets you see how things really are. Step back a bit and see what's happening here from a big picture perspective. Ask yourself what your best friend would tell you is happening.

&gt; It's hard to convey, online, what our relationship really looks like - but there's no doubt in my mind she wants to be with me.

She wants to be with you so badly that she lashes out at you twice a week, said no to moving in with you, and then took a job 8 hours away?

I think you may be projecting (or hoping) just a little here, man."
"Im so so sorry to hear that. :( i know how it feels... my ex said similar things..such as  ""You need to squat"" ""your ass looks like its sagging"" ""only really hot girls can wear jeans""  ..... yet there is nothing wrong with my body. Im just thin and he was into really big butts. It ruined my self esteem for close to 3 years and im still self conscious. Lets just remember that we are good the way we are and most people dont think such things at all when they see us! &lt;3 i hope you can have your confidence back and forget about that guy :) "
"This. If her goal is to convert people, you do that by feeding them delicious yummy vegan gravy and mashed potatoes and stuffing. Not yelling at them."
"&gt; As someone that's been hurt, I would be a bit paranoid about my partner going out with other single people.

That would be difficult, but would be *your* problem to deal with, and dealing would be you handling your own insecurities, not restricting someone else because of your problems. "
"Your mom has already raised her kids. Why does she need to take care of your daughter “1-2 times a week” so you can have a “social life”???? 

That is unfair to your mom and is what makes your sister right. You just don’t see how wrong you are. 

Someone already posted how she suffers from anxiety, but still goes to work and does not let her illness define her. All I read in your posts is:

1. You don’t work because your sickness won’t allow you too
2. BUT, it’s ok to go out “1-2 times a week” to have a social life so you can be happy. Even when there’s no work income. 

I’m sure your mom loves her granddaughter, but most likely telling you what your sister told you would cause a rift, and she won’t want that. 

I think all this makes you seem very selfish. Only thinking of yourself. 
"
Yep but it's the best advice
"Op has had NC with these people it was pretty obvious this was still an issue for him. At the very least it was THEIR job to ask him considering he was the victim here. It would have taken no time calling him ""hey we are thinking about inviting your sister and you ex over and we wanted to know if you are going to be fine with them being there or you want to have other plans for us to meet"" instead do of ""hey your ex wife that cheated on you with your own sister and her are coming over, see you there""."
Have you done it yet OP?
"That is a thing that people do, yes"
"Hilarious that she's richer than you and still saying ""this is the only nice thing I have to wear!"" Lady, you could get something better at Target for $50. 

I have plenty of friends who are richer and/or prettier than I am who are still jealous of me. Beauty and wealth are not the only qualities to be envied. I bet your successful relationship isn't the only thing she's jealous of."
Can confirm.  My ex husband brought Random Internet Women home to fuck while I was working and my kids were sleeping in their rooms.
"&gt; From an ethical standpoint, I think you really owe it to Kara to do whatever you can to reach out and offer her your support. Let her know that you are also horrified by Jess’ behavior and are completely opposed to what went down. Send a card, send some flowers, relay a message through her mom if she (understandably) is not responding to your calls, idk. If I were you I would be more worried about trying to help her feel better than anything else.

I would actually advice against this. It's actually more likely that Kara wants to distance themselves from everything regarding the situation --including OP. Yes, OP wasn't involved, but Kara doesn't know that. And honestly, Kara doesn't have to know that /now/. Any unwanted contact --whether cards, calls, texts, etc.-- is easily taken as just more pressure and stress on Kara when that is definitely something she doesn't need. 

Yes, maybe send one text that apologizes, states that they were no way involved, and that Kara doesn't have to respond. The text is to not overwhelm them, to not force OP to get involved in their life, and instead just says, ""I'm sorry, I wasn't involved nor would have let this happen, I'm wishing you the best, don't feel pressured to respond""

OP should instead focus on getting out the lease, reach out to local resources for in their campus/city that provide training in how to support survivors. I say this because I have been that person to intervene when well-meaning friends tried to comfort survivors of abuse/sexual assault but were about to do things that would have made it worse --trying to reach out excessively, focusing on apologizing instead of actual support, trying to pry for more info, etc. 

"
"For what it's worth, that's completely ok. You don't have to make a decision right now. It's ok to take your time and evaluate your options. Just please know that you do have options - just because you married her doesn't mean you're trapped. And I promise you, wanting to be happy isn't greedy.

If you have close friends/family, now is definitely the time to start getting a support network around you, for whatever you might choose to do. Reach out to people you trust and tell them how you're feeling. 

(And this probably goes without saying but just to reiterate the advice of some other people here please, please don't get her pregnant while you have doubts about the relationship. Because so far, all of this is completely reversible, but once there's a kid in the mix, it won't be.)"
This is usually what I tell my friends when they date weird or quirky people. Nothing wrong with weird or quirky but is it still gonna be cute a year from now? 
In these examples I wonder if he’s projecting. If there’s no reason on her end to suspect infidelity maybe it’s there because of him.
Or just simply be finished in the 10 minutes she’s allowed before she has to message back lol. 
"OK. Some perspective. I know a lesbian who was with 22 guys (22 guys, not had sex with a guy 22 times) before she figured it out. I've never slept with a girl and I know I'm gay. LOL. It's different for everyone. Take some introspective time, don't panic."
"One of my friend's grandmother's told her something profound: When you find yourself walking on eggshells, stomp.

You are doing things that make you uncomfortable to prevent the risk of her feeling uncomfortable. The first thing you need to communicate is that you are deeply unhappy with the course of the relationship. Reach out in to your social circle and tell your close friends that you are deeply unhappy. 

The next thing I would do is schedule an appointment with a school therapist. Tell an unbiased observer how you are feeling, they will validate your feelings and help you plan next steps. It's okay to say you need an emergency appointment, it happens all the time during finals week. 

If you do these things, you will start to reclaim small pieces of your life, maybe it's a night alone. Maybe it's studying off-campus with another classmate. You are allowed to want and do these things. If you remain calm and reasonable and communicate that you are unhappy and plan (don't ask, just do) time for yourself, her reaction will do all of the work for you. 

I suspect that she has deeper problems than you're noticing and as a result of feeling insecure about the future, she's glommed on to this idea of what your relationship is. But she's not listening to your needs or even observing her own behavior for what it is: smothering. You're not even living, you're living in fear. So start to put up small boundaries around your time and personal space (which you'd be entitled to in a marriage anyway), and see how she reacts. I suspect she needs more help than you can give her if she is threatening harm to herself."
"I suspect the mental diagnosis will be for OP’s wife, since this guy boils down to “women are crazy loons and men are their victims”."
"Go to the shows?

Watching a professional shoot or show (or semi pro in this case?) tends to take the skeeziness out of what your mind was picturing "
"Her son is not making any decisions at all, he is asking his mother for things and SHE is making the decision with either saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’. A 13-year-old child does not make household decisions in the ways you’re talking about, their parent(s) do. Any ‘decision’ you feel this child has made against your wishes has actually been made by your partner, by either agreeing/disagreeing with it or allowing him to behave in the way he does. For example, he didn’t ‘decide’ for the litter to be moved, he asked his mother and she decided when she agreed and moved it. Stop viewing a child who doesn’t hold any real agency as the problem and realise the real issue is ALL with your partner, otherwise you’ll get nowhere."
"Personally, her lack of boundaries with this particular ex and with other guys in general would be too much for me to handle and I'd move on. You can't force your gf to do anything, but you can always move on yourself if you can't handle being with her."
She has told you twice she doesn't like you and made it pretty damn clear that she doesn't like you in that way.
Crying is not a choice. It's a physiological reaction to stress.
"You are not responsable for what she did - she would have done it sooner or later. Answering her call would AT MOST have delayed this by a day or so. She is in professional hands now. Listen to your aunt. 


why did you fight mom? "
"Don't pretend you're the logical one when you're the one claiming men are more driven by visuals - like that somehow makes what he did understandable. It doesn't. He's a disgusting pig and men have choices. He made a bad choice no excuse or ""reasoning"" makes it okay or less bad. "
Invite your parents to spend the holiday with you.
"That kind of talk is so prevalent and it's honestly disturbing. I see it a lot on here whenever posts come up where a woman is talking about her sexual past, the terminology becomes very objectifying and distant. "
"For REAL. OP, associating with this person makes you look terrible. I would never date someone who kept friends like that around. If I were your wife I would be questioning your respect and loyalty towards me. "
"Nothing. Delete block and move on. Stop letting him get to you because yeah annoying you is entirely the point here.

Friends bring it up? ""Does it look like he and I are back together?"""
I don't think lying about not seeing anyone else and faking sickness to meet the other girl is part of normal dating though.
"Side note: There’s a really killer vegan cupcake recipe out there I found a couple years ago and it’s one of my favs. 

So it might also be a nice dessert option. It doesn’t taste vegan either and it’s a great, moist cupcake. "
"""I'm unhappy"" is more than enough of a reason to break up. But this sounds like this is much more than just cold feet--she controls who you hang out with, and you can't have a serious conversation without her derailing it with her unhappiness. It sounds like she has issues she's not working on and she's dragging you down.

Alone and able to grow is better than together and trapped. If you can't say ""fuck yes"" to getting married, don't do it. I'd make one last ditch effort with her, and get into counseling. If she won't go with you, break it off. You have to put yourself first. "
"He confided to his girlfriend that he wasn’t comfortable with something sexual that the two of you did. You responded by lambasting him and telling him that his feelings were wrong. 

And seven years without penetrative sec because you’re afraid of getting pregnant? Jesus. Haven’t you guys heard of condoms and birth control? Use both at the same time and you’ll be safe. "
"Not doing something to help fulfill his needs??? They had sex and he climaxed! She didn’t even “wake him up for sex”, she just cuddled him and he woke up and they wound up having sex. He’s being a big baby because he didn’t get sex twice when he wanted. "
"&gt;I'd assumed he'd tell me when there was something going on I could come to which he hadn't (because he'd though I wouldn't want to come anyway so he'd just mention he was going out). 

Ok, not massively shitty but still kind of shitty in that the version he has of you in his head is pretty uncool which he used to justify himself being uncool. 

I honestly think you should try therapy before it becomes an issue again. 

Glad you know what's going on though. "
"Tell her, she has the right to be making decisions with all the facts"
"Goto the bank. And make it so your mom can't touch your money. If you can't donthag basic thing and take charge advice won't help you.
Also, be strong. Hard to do but just do it. Tell your mom to not touch your money. Get angry,stand up for yourself. Suicidal? Screw that you want to be happy and you should fight for it.  Don't be sad or upset. Get angry and fight to be independent."
What if he turns out to be a pro life nut? Then not only will he not pay for half but he may harrass her and add to her stress. If she does plan on pursuing a relationship with him after this then yeah she should tell him even if she's aborting. 
"Dude, just let her go. Don't waste her time. She loves you, but she wants to be a mother more. If you lead her on until it's too late she will just hate you."
You’re getting downvoted because you’re acting weird and obsessive and you’re making a big deal out of nothing. This is like... 5% on the awkward scale. Laugh about it with a friend and then move on. 
"Choking (which he has done to you in a nonconsensual context) is literally the number one sign that someone will kill their partner in the future. Please, please do not isolate yourself with this man."
That's not abnormal. Accept rates are low and people are busy. It's not a sign that you're unwanted. How often do you invite people to do things?
"Do you really think kids are replaceable? Oh, this one died, we'll make another?

This may be just the attitude that hurts her the most.

Let her go. "
"You have no idea. I got a pocket full of little instances like that. She gave me an ugly as sin necklace as a gift for no reason. I didn't want to be rude, because we just started dating so I said it's lovely. She said ""I'm glad you like it, because this necklace has a lot sentimental value."" Apparently it's a replica of the necklace that character wears in the show."
"Your post history is worrying - please try to get to some therapy. It sounds like you've had a lot of upheaval in the past year, I'm sure you could benefit from talking about all of it with a professional. Good luck x"
"&gt; find a time machine

and break up her parents engagement"
Am I the only one who wants to see my SO every day?
"You've been dating for 3 months, and are moving in together? When you aren't keen on living with her dog? Sorry friend, but it sounds like you should hold off on renting a place together for awhile..."
"OP's entire defense is ""She wanted it"".

He was only FWB with Allison because ""she wanted it"".

Now he's moving in with Casey because ""She wanted it"".

I bet if we press him on how the two (He and casey) even started dating it would be something like ""Well, she pursued me..."" ... i.e, ""She wanted it"".

It's no wonder that OP's actions are coming back to bite him in the ass - I could believe that he's the type to hide behind that defense of ""It wasn't MY idea!"" for just about everything..."
"When I first read the title I was gonna try to see this from both sides because I can be bad at texting too... but my unresponsiveness only lasts several hours at most, not multiple days. Yeah, he needs to be more engaged in this relationship or stop wasting your time. I don’t blame you for being frustrated. "
"&gt; you might even make a new friend

You have obviously read OP very differently to how I did."
"I think some parents do. And the ones that don't may not necessarily think of it as a totally foreign  concept but just a difficult topic to approach and compromise on. I had sex for the first time as a teenager and it was with my monogamous boyfriend who I thought I loved. He decided to tell everyone and I was humiliated by a lot of people at school. I remember wishing I had never done it and waited for a better person to share that with since he only cared about reaching that milestone. Even adults are sometimes not equipped to handle the emotional baggage of sex, kids certainly aren't. 

Teens might be capable of engaging in loving and safe sex but it's still worrisome for a parent to watch their kid navigate that. When my kids are teens I will encourage them to wait until they are truly ready but I won't refuse to give them the safety tools they need to be careful (condoms, etc). "
"Yeah, same. I've been a vegetarian for decades, not gonna change. The number of people who don't want that, while it's a valid preference because your diet does affect your partner, yet want to date me, either hoping to change it or pretending it's a non-issue, is silly. Like, why?! Deal breakers are totally fine, I don't get why someone would be so eager to date *anyone* that they'd overlook attraction or compatibility"
"Yep. It's so sad too because everyone only remembers the obnoxious vegans/vegetarians, since the normal ones aren't preaching or even talking about it most of the time. 

Like I get it, if America still had slavery or something and my family wouldn't stop, I would absolutely not shut up about it, especially while they were serving my meals. But then, I would expect everyone to shun me from their dinner tables, since ruining their dinners would be my goal honestly. Maybe that's what she's going for...?"
"Accusing an innocent partner of being abusive is actually a very common abuse tactic. You are making reasonable requests and he's responding by blowing up in your face. At best he's immature and unable to take any constructive criticism. But my money is on him trying to actively train you to never complain.

&gt;He just wants to make me happy and feels like he doesn't

That's a lie. People who are upset about hurting someone's feelings get sad and weepy. Now that isn't a good tactic either since it turns the person you hurt into your comforter, but at least it CAN have roots in love and caring. He's getting angry with you. He doesn't see his behaviour as the problem, he sees you not liking it as the problem. "
"&gt;Are my boyfriend’s concerns valid?

No.

&gt;What should I do?

Leave him.

You are so young, you have so much of your life left ahead of you, and *so many accomplishments* coming your way. Why would you want to tie yourself to someone who refuses to celebrate you? What else will you give up in order to save this relationship?"
"No it's not. I work in a client-facing role and I can tell you that there are in fact ""mean"" people who like to ruin others' days just to feel good about themselves. "
"I'm really confused about how this situation has ended with her *still* being in touch with him. 

That restaurant conversation should have been a breakup and that should have been the end of it. If she's in a romantic relationship with two men (even if she's only sleeping with one) she needs to actually choose one and actually stick with it. Just saying she's chosen you means nothing if her actions don't back it up. Don't be a fool OP, she's being abnormally selfish and has seeming gotten away with lying to you for your entire relationship. I can't see how you can believe a word she says!"
"&gt; I have a hunch he's depressed. But I don't know how to talk to him about it or try to get him help, as he has become pretty defensive over the last several months. When I suggest that he start looking for work, or even just get off the couch and go do something outside, he gets very defensive, makes excuses, and claims that I'm being a 'controlling girlfriend'. When I try to sit him down and have a serious conversation about my issues with our relationship (i.e. him not working, infrequent sex, emotional distance, etc.), he insists I'm being manipulative and emotionally abusive.

Okay. Then he can leave, right?

Seriously. Think about this. If talking about your problems in a serious, adult way is *so terrible,* if trying to get him to do things is *so controlling,* if bringing up issues in the house is *so manipulative and abusive,* then what's stopping him from leaving? 

Oh, right. It's because you're his meal ticket.

Honestly, I think you've done everything right here. You gave him space. You gave him time. You've tried talking to him about the issues. *He's* the one who says he can't do it. *He's* the one who's not doing anything to fix those problems. *He's* the one who says even trying to talk about the issues in the first place is abusive and manipulative.

It's entirely possible that he's depressed. But that doesn't really matter. Depression doesn't make you incapable of talking about your problems like a big boy. You're not his therapist and you're not his mommy. You can't make him get help or fix things: he has to do that himself. And he has told you, over and over, ""I don't wanna.""

I don't know if it's possible to get the boyfriend you used to love back. Even if it is, you're not going to be able to do it, because it's not your job. He has to do it, because he's the only one who can. So forget Old!Boyfriend. You're not dating him, you're dating the guy you have now. Do you want to stay with the guy you have now?"
"&gt; He didn't park illegally, but you need him to be wrong.

This seems to be the core of her issue here. She parked illegally and got a ticket, but what she wants is for *him* to admit it's actually his fault, and by doing so to absolve her of any blame or guilt. Life probably is much easier when you can find a way to blame someone else when your own actions have negative consequences. 

"
"OP you're missing the point. This **obviously** mentally unstable person is not safe to be around. He would have taken his revenge no matter what. 

Get away from this person. He is dangerous. What happens if he hurts himself seriously and decides you were the cause of the accident? He would want to inflict the same injury on you!!"
"I agree with this. If she was engaged with the guy long enough for her friends to leave the bar unnoticed she's spending way too long with the guys and not paying her friends enough attention. Girls nights are meant to be just that, a girls night, not an ""exchange numbers with random guys because they might end up being a really cool person and I might get to be his best man in the future"" night. OP, your friends have made it clear that they don't want you to redirect the attention of these guys to them, so shut the guys down quickly and stick with your girls if you want to keep going out with them. "
"This is as bad as that, maybe even worse. Dear god! This guy is scary! Please, don't be near him!"
Why would you even want to stay with this creepy abusive asshole?
"&gt; But my emotions are telling me not to hurt my bf like that

You get that *he's hurting you like that* right? He isn't *feeding* you. No. A real partner, that cared about you, would want you to be anywhere you could be happy and healthy - *adequately fed* shouldn't even be a question. "
"&gt;  I don’t believe in divorce and neither does he. So any comments about divorce are not helpful to my situation

A lot of people who end up divorced feel like this at the start. Being married to someone who you are, not attracted to, don't love and can't have good sex with wipes away that conviction over time. This is your one shot at life, why would you spend it unhappy when you have the power to be happy?"
"I am autistic (what they used to call Aspergers). Your wife’s processes sounds very much like mine. On really bad days I can’t be in the physical presence of anyone, even my partner of 15 years. Phone calls are excruciatingly painful too. 

Texting and e-mailing has been a gift for me. It allows me to choose words with precision; it takes away the difficulty of having to parse the entire gauntlet equation of: 

physically present conversation =
[words] + [literal dictionary meaning] + [their body language] + [our relationship history/modifier to context of conversation] + [detection of metaphor or specialised language] + [filtering out automatic word association and internal mini infodump as each word comes] + [normalise own behaviour and face] + [select appropriate body language to display extrapolated expected reactions to what X is saying] + [engage enough with the meaning to reply with relevance but not avalanche with over-detail] + [THEN wrangle and identify and coalesce own emotions &amp; opinions around subject]

It’s hard work, and can be more difficult when talking about subjects that she finds important or emotionally connected to. Texting gives a bit of breathing room and weeds out a lot of the above equation. "
"Um if I were your wife my bags would be packed. Unless you're willing to majorly compensate for this, reflects pretty poorly on you. "
"Tell her, OP. She deserves to know the man she married took the first chance he got to sleep with another woman. "

"Personally I think this is weird, but have you talked to him about his thought processes? More than a few gay and lesbian couples shy away from traditional engagement and marriage tropes, because it feels too much like buying into heteronormative stereotypes about relationships.

If this is just about finding a fresh way for you guys to affirm and explore your commitment to each other, perhaps you can help him find something a little less gross and creepy."
"On the very slim chance this is no troll....

&gt; I wasn't as physically attractive as the guys she dated before me... she would [have sex with] with the most popular/fratty type guys out there ... they were ALL White ... when that type of stuff didn't work out, she told her friend to just introduce her to another Indian guy.

Her actions tell you who she *wants* to have sex with. She may now claim to be ""past that"", but no, you are never past what you find attractive and exciting. You simply settle for what is now available and otherwise acceptable.

In short, yeah, now that she is cruising towards her thirties, you likely are the ""marriage material"" guy.  Someone else got the fun, young, wild times, and you can get the middle-age bills and other stuff.  Great deal for you! /s

&gt; I am really feeling like I should break up with her. 

I would. No anger, no harsh words. You sound like you are just not interested in gals who sees you as the ""Indian dude backup"", now that she is not able to pull men she really wants. That is a perfectly healthy and normal filter to apply."
"Yeah, I have no idea what's going on or why K was pissed at the beginning of the story."

OP, your husband is being a complete asshole. Tell him off. I hope he apologises profusely once he's woken up properly.

"There's a difference between looking the other way when they open a door, and holding the door open for them. At that age it's good to let them take the step of opening the door, because it's one more pause point that lets them reconsider whether they really want to."

Yes, they are Chairs but they are so much more. "
"Since you two aren't married and you have no biological connection to the baby's conception, would you actually have any legal rights at all?

I think you two need to speak to a family law lawyer as soon as possible.  This ""turkey baster"" pregnancy I suspect is going to be a horrifying legal hassle for everyone involved including the biological father, unless you two figure out a way to sign a lot of papers where he relinquishes his rights and you formally adopt the child."
"Yea, that message was obviously for someone else. If it truly was about a movie, it would have been phrased more like ""hey want to see that movie on Friday?"". The wording on the initial message implies plans were made prior (to whom, it wasn't you) and he was chatting with that person about Friday and he expressed excitement for the (pre-made) plans.

I'd run and be glad you dodged a bullet. Or if you want to fight for the relationship, nip it in the butt right here right now. Demand to see messages and explain why. Set boundaries. Obviously isn't the best choice, but I wouldn't just dismiss it. "
"The more elaborate the lie the better the chance of getting caught.    Keep it as simple as possible.   Tell them you do video editing and production, and that you are are a contractor to a bigger freelance company, the work you do is boring, industry specific, nothing that would ever be in TV, or even YouTube.  "
"I think hormones have a play in this, but why wasn't it a good time to have the phone call? My bf sometimes silences calls that I don't see who the caller is, but it doesn't bother me... "
"Thank you, it's an excuse. One I accepted and thought he would over come but now it just feels like an excuse to just not say anything. I've seriously felt like I wasn't worthy of his love. And it's painful and messes with my head. "
"I tried to explain to my grandma that I felt this way and she does not even care, and won't talk to him about it. I am an adult and able to speak with him, yeah, but it is very hard.  Confrontation is always difficult but I might need to say something because I ended up just going back into my room without saying anything. Thanks for your input"
"&gt;Does he seriously think your parents abused him or is he just saying it?

That's what I don't know and what concerns me the most. There are some things that if he doesn't remember, then I'd genuinely wonder if there's something wrong with his brain. Like claiming he has to work to feed himself at school or that we left him at home when we went to see our grandfather. These are things that are just blatant lies.

But to me he says that I'm deluded because our parents ""favored"" me more so they never deprived me. He's told other people that our parents buy me designer clothes and pay for my fancy vacations while they make him work just to pay for food. I ask him give me an example of these vacations and clothes and whatever, and he just ignores me. 

The one ""example"" he has is when I got an internship my freshman year summer that I applied for myself. My parents paid for my plane ticket to and from that city. The rest of my living costs were covered partly by the company and partly with my own savings. My brother claims this is a clear example of favoritism because they paid for my $1000 plane ticket and not his $10,000 summer program? He ended up staying at home that entire summer because he didn't bother to apply for anything else."
"Her boyfriend is only 25 and they have been dating for less than a year. It is perfectly reasonable that, at this stage in their relationship, he is not branching out to building a relationship with her child."
"You literally have no reason to trust, installing an app like tinder is not something you have. Did he let you see any messages he had recieved? I mean come on, installing Tinder while abroad, you sure u havent been cheated on?"
"""I am not your secretary."""
The decent thing would be to answer her questions honestly so she doesn't continue wasting her life with a liar. I guarantee he is lying to her and telling lies about you so she won't leave him. You'd want answers in her position. Do unto others... 
"So...who just goes straight to messages? That's weird.  

Is there a reason you wanted him to look at your phone? Is there something you wanted him to see? I thought it was pretty socially normal that one does not just look through someone else phone. "
"&gt;It will only get worse.

Honestly, if you stay with him, it really will. Because the only thing he'll have learned is that he can do those things to you and get away with it."
"Could just be that your jokes and making fun of her have actually been upsetting your mom and she was trying to act like it didn't.

Would also help if you told us what you said"
"&gt; I have always known i have a problem with controlling my emotions

I bet. Is he maybe also the ""rational one"" wielding logic alone to handle life's hurdles? Let's examine your situation:

You do your makeup, he comments and you make changes, then you leave. So far so good. Then he ""notices"" that you didn't actually do a good job fixing the problem. Let's assume for a moment that there even *is* a problem. Okay, so now your super observant, ""helpful,"" boyfriend points this out. Great. You tell him you can't fix it where you are and offer to go back home (logical!). He shoots that down and continues to harp on it. So what does he want? What outcome is Mr. NottheEmotionalOne shooting for here? 

A) He wants to bring you down, insult you, make you feel incompetent/ugly/generally bad. 

B) He's goading you into an ""overly emotional"" response to continue the fiction that you're just another histrionic woman. 

C) I dunno, he's an idiot?

Point is, there is NO reason to behave the way he did, harping on 'imperfection.' What's more, emotions ARE a rational response to someone treating you like shit. Physical pain is unpleasant, but it tells you to get your hand out of the fucking fire. Similarly, emotions can be unpleasant, but right now yours are telling you to get yourself out of a verbally abusive situation. "
"Right? She seems like a very young 25. For her top priority to be a $10K ring after it was very clearly explained to be out of her boyfriend's price range is already not great if it isn't paired with her coming up with ideas on how she can contribute and save towards it. 

But for it to be her top priority WHILE her boyfriend's dad is going through a scary health crisis and her future little siblings-in-law are young and vulnerable and could be in dire need of money? She isn't ready for this kind of commitment and adult relationship.  OP, maybe this woman will be a different person with different priorities at 35, but right now she is not someone you should marry. "
Do I want him to hurt? Yes. Do I want to fuck him up? Yes but I'm understanding to a fault and I hate myself for it. I wish I could be an asshole but I'm just not. The reason why I think she should know is because I'm a firm believer in honesty and openness which allows people to make informed decisions. I think it's WRONG that he's living this way and it only becomes my issue because it involves my wife and now I have knowledge of it. I'd feel like shit if she didn't st least know who she was dealing with. Maybe that's selfish of me and my moral standards but that's how I choose to live and how I want to raise my children. The only reason this question came up is because I told my wife I'm gonna tell her and she asked me not to because she's pregnant and does not want to stress her out which is why I'm now torn or if it would even matter in the long run. I don't know her at all so for all I know she could blow this up and put it over Facebook which is something I DONT want which is why I'm hesitating. I want to keep this under wraps for my kids sake and I hate that I'm saying this but I still love my wife and don't want her put on blast in public. Again I'm always thinking of all angles and try to be sensible at all times.
"Break up. She deserves someone who doesn't judge her for her past. 

This is why people lie about this - because they get judged. "
"Preach. I think many of us have dated this guy. He's insidiously charming and most of the time his only downfall is the lack of commitment, which you decide to overlook for a while because he's just so *lovely* in every other aspect. 

Eventually, the uncertainty of the whole arrangement eats at you - you find evidence of other women in his house a day after he's stroked your hair and kissed your face good morning - and you realise the whole situation is just a self-esteem crusher. Why are you not good enough? You're there emotionally, physically, sexually, and intellectually for him - how needy is this guy that he needs to keep his options open on the odd day of the week you aren't around?

If you truly want a relationship - get out. 
If you are ok with being FWBs - start to distance yourself, for your own mental health."
"Five months is a long time to lie and cheat.  It sounds like this relationship is over, you will most likely never be able to trust her again after this. If I were you I'd wait until you can calm down a little and gather your thoughts, then wake her up to have ""the talk.""  Although it would be better to wait until tomorrow you will be in absolute misery until then and it's just prolonging the inevitable.  Good luck."
"It's pretty disrespectful of him to take photos of women's feet and masturbate to them. They didn't consent to that.

He's also being a selfish partner. It's fine to indulge him in his fetish, but it sounds like it's starting to become an obsession. You don't sound like you are getting sexual satisfaction from this relationship. It's all about him. You need to have a come to Jesus talk with him about how he's completely disregarding your needs. He can't even focus on you to cum. He has to have porn.

A break from porn is probably what he needs, but a therapist would also benefit him."
"Though there were different reasons for it, I could have written portions of this myself about six months ago, and we have gotten to a much better place now. We started scheduling sex, and it was a godsend. 

Put your foot down with your boyfriend. Tell him that making time for intimacy is deeply important to you. Then pick a day, once a week to start, and agree that you’ll have sex then. Nobody really has to initiate since it’s an agreed-upon time, so that helps relieve that particular pressure. I know it sounds terribly unromantic, but once you’re having regular sex, you’ll stop being worried about not having it, and then any little particulars become easier to address. 

"
"You're a parent. You should know you won't like everything you have to do, but you still have to do it. "
"Yes. This. 

I was hit, more than once, by someone I dated years ago and still feel like I don't deserve to call it abuse because it's not like we were in a fight or... 

Oh my gosh, it genuinely just came over me as I was typing that out how that sounds. Like I genuinely just NOW realized I'm not being misleading or exaggerating or trying to make someone out to be evil by calling them abusive when they did physically hit and shove me. 

What I'm saying is... it's really easy to tell yourself you aren't in a relationship if you don't see your relationship as the picture you have in your head of an abusive relationship, like for me I was like ""well we weren't in a fight, we weren't yelling, it's not like they were taking me home on every date and beating the heck out of me, it was just kind of a few times and it wasn't that hard like I wasn't hurt""

Shoot. I'm really going to have to think about my experience some more. But take it from me, OP: you really, really want the satisfaction of leaving this person immediately, the first time it happens. It's what I wish I had done. "
"""she should be allowed to discuss these things with her friends as a sounding board""

"If you read through some other comments, she spent 8 months salary on Christmas presents for extended family. I do not think it was a wise choice since her bf has no money and she HAD to take on all the bills, but then again, the bf should have saved. "
"Do not use this man to make your life easier.  If you go after him, under false pretenses, thinking that you can just ""fake it til you make it"", that's pretty terrible.

Unless you KNOW that you love him and want to be with him and can't wait to touch him, don't bother.  It's unfair to him."
"You took his children to spend time with people who beat him, humiliated him, and who only wanted to 'start fresh' because they could no longer hold the physical upper hand. Jesus Christ, woman. 'Family' isn't a magic talisman that negates abuse."
"Like, I don't have or want kids, but I get how that makes this worse. They're kids, they can't make decisions or judge for themselves if this is safe or okay. I feel like she did it deliberately to show him ""Look, your family isn't monsters! They didn't abuse the kids!""

Meanwhile I wouldn't even let my cats around my BIL, but they can sense evil pretty well, so there's that. "
"""We loved him, he was just the closest punching bag we could find!"""
".... I’m sorry this just seems weird to me. You think your wife is cheating based on your mom saying she acted weird?

Your wife’s reaction seemed pretty normal to me. Actually I’d be pissed if in a completely normal relationship with no previous issues or inklings of this kind my SO decided I must be cheating because a family friend was around for a completely normal reason and his mom said “it seemed weird”

She might be cheating she might not but why is your trust in her so easily swayed??? "
"So he wants to keep you in reserve so that when he’s done sleeping around ‘in several years’ he has a woman waiting who will bear him a child? Wtf? Does this open relationship extend to you too, or is he he only one that gets to shop elsewhere?

I say go. He’s dishonest and a proven liar and has no respect for you. The upheaval will be disruptive but you can settle again elsewhere with your dignity and self respect intact. "
This exactly. OP's hubby must have thought being a dad was just tossing the pigskin around on Sundays. 
"Hey OP, I'm from the Netherlands and know how sensitive this topic can be to people. Sadly, I don't think that even if there were a respectful way to communicate this to your boyfriend's family that they'd consider it that way.

Stand your ground on the issue though, you aren't alone!"

"Nope. Items were stolen, OP has a right to report them stolen."
"There are so many serious issues in this post. The fact that you're asking if you're the one being unreasonable points to a history of manipulation in your relationship. It sounds like your wife is resentful of children out of jealousy. What she is asking is **beyond** unreasonable. You need to ask yourself if this is the kind of person you want to spend the rest of your life with.

Whatever you do, please maintain that relationship with your niece. Do not allow your wife to come between you and your *actual* family."
"Are you a partner the same way your gf is? Or do you go above and beyond like Nina?

It sounds like you're either actually frustrated and resentful in your own relationship - or like you want to swing bat outside your league.

If you're that high quality of a partner yourself I think you need to really think about whether you're happy with your gf and try to separate it from the idea of Nina. Maybe you're just starting to fall out of love."

"Yes! reading the part where this grown was woman complains that a NEW MOTHER didn't make her MIL feel ""welcome"" when she was dealing with the aftermath of popping out a newborn? just from that example of self -centered silliness, I can tell why she doesn't want to be around this family."
"If he doesn't know what happened or why, it's hard to judge.  They could have had sex, or maybe nothing happened.  It could have been consensual on his part, or not.  It could have been consensual on her part, or not.  

I think he should start by asking his friends to try to reconstruct what was going on that night, and he should share everything he learns with you.  He should get STD tested as soon as is feasible and you should abstain or use protection until he knows if he got exposed to something.

If anyone has the ability to track down the girl, it might be good if someone (you, maybe?  Or one of her friends) could ask *her* if they hooked up, and if not, what she was doing in his room and in his bed.  

But also, maybe how the night ended isn't as important as how the night went earlier on.  At some point your boyfriend was unconscious.  But earlier he was just drunk and making decisions.  What decisions did he make?"
"See, every abusive relationship I've been in (yes, sadly, more than one; I'm a slow learner), this is the hallmark behavior. Right before things start to escalate. It's all manipulative, especially The Silent Treatment® she got there at the end.

If I caught my SO under these circumstances he'd probably explain, ""Babe, I know how this looks. Let me tell you why I have that.""

"&gt;now that it's cold out and I'm not using my AC unit which would drown out the sound during the summer, I can actually hear it very clearly.

Have you thought about running a fan or getting a white noise machine?  That could help drown out the noise.

If that doesn't work, I think you are totally reasonable to ask her to not have her alarm go off over and over for 30+ minutes.  She needs to find another solution.  They have vibrating alarms that are worn on the wrist that don't make noise, for example.  There are also light alarms that wake a person up by getting brighter and brighter.  

Also, if she's having this much trouble getting up, she should consider that she's possibly not getting enough sleep or has some kind of sleep disorder.  Or maybe she just can't get up that early and she needs to find a way to change her schedule so that she can get up later when it's easier for her.  "

"Im 27, AFAB, regularly seen as a teenager.

You need to learn how to look like an adult. You can. You dont even have to go femme. I personally suggest thrift stores so you can experiment for cheap. There is a HUGE range of styles. 

Business casual is a good place to look. I find button up shirts under a nice, form fitting sweater make me look like an adult. Hairstyle is also a huge difference, I got a haircut and people treat me like a Serious Adult now.

I personally just have three outfits I wear for job interviews and important appointments where I have to be taken seriously. Just have a handful of ""Im a grown up"" outfits you wear for dates with one hairstyle and youre good. 

 The bottom line is that no GOOD man your age is going to be comfortable with everyone looking at him thinking he's dating a jailbait highschooler. And, frankly, most mature men have well outgrown that ""cutesy teenage"" aesthetic and *want* a partner who looks like an *adult woman*.

Thats not going away. Its going to get worse as you get older.  
"
"&gt; When I got back I just dry heaved and broke down crying into the foetal position

And that right there is probably why he didn't tell you (if it's true). You apparently take non-monogamous sex very seriously. You mention him being ""understanding"" about you having done so a few times as if that was not to be expected. You're both adults and it's reasonable to assume that you'd both been around the block before getting together.

If it is true, is that a dealbreaker? Do you really want to break up over his past today, when he is the same person he has been the 2 years you've been together? Personally, I'd be curious why he lied about it, but it would not affect a present relationship and breaking up would not even cross my mind."
She is such a delusion narcissist that she will never see light or reason on this or probably anything much.
"^ this! Your husbands behaviour is almost identical to my ex fiancé’s behaviour; over 7 years together and this type of verbal abuse (and it is abuse to speak to you like that) began to turn physical. Not saying that will happen here but please just be careful. 

Not to mention how dangerous it was to dump you in a car park (ex also used to do things like this, lock me out of the house etc). "
"no offence but this type of behavior just stigmatizes mental health.  Something is wrong here, people should talk about things that are wrong in confidence to their friends.  Should her and Jack just live like this and continue on, without any outside support because it's embarassing.  Is telling a therapist a violation of his privacy?  

For many people the path to answering mental health questions is &gt; family &gt; friends &gt; professionals.  Family is her husband, I'm assuming she asked him and has gotten no answer, so step 2 is friends.  Which you are ignoring, I would tell her to go visit a therapist if you refuse to discuss this, or a better friend (which is what she did)"
"Try talking to domestic violence shelters in your area that might be able to help. Or some friends or paternal family

I'm so sorry honey. Judging from how calm your response has been this isn't the only abuse she's inflicted on you, even if it's the first physical abuse. She could have easily killed you. A correctly performed choke hold will knock you out in less than 10 seconds and kill you in 30.

You always have the right to defend yourself. Always. Her back doesn't come into it. You life and safty is more important

You need to get some therapy asap. This is not normal or even close to it. This is so far past normal its out of sight. "

"OP regularly had them cleaned and cared for by antiquity specialists not ""left to collect dust in an attic."""
"When my parents first told me around the same age as those kids that ""Santa is not real,"" I was *devastated* and perhaps your boyfriend had the same experience, so he feels like you were inconsiderate in your actions? Yes, he did overreact with how much he berated you, but you also did not apologize for your actions and admit you were wrong. Do you have a habit of not being socially aware and saying/doing things that could impact the people around you? If so, then that may explain why your boyfriend snapped. In his mind, you may have essentially ruined Christmas this year for these kids and now put their parents in a tough spot."

He lives with them so he sees them much more than that.
Yes. At 2 months the relationship should still be easy and blissful. You shouldn’t be on pins and needles waiting for the next blow up or mean comment. I’d dump him and look into therapy. He likely sensed you’d be vulnerable due to your past and has been picking at your vulnerabilities. Work on those and developing a good sensor for abusive behavior. 
I was really freaked out. It did scare me a bit. He took my things without asking because he knew he NEEDED them to leave. He trapped me there. Shit is wack and abusive and just fucking weird. I've blocked his number. 
I'm 28 and I barely have anything resembling a life plan. 
"Are you saying that she's an alcoholic (and maybe gambling addict)?  I'm guessing you haven't been around alcoholics before, but her behavior really seems like alcoholism, mental health issues (and undealt with grief).  Alcoholics don't really deal with emotions well, so when her Mom died, I'm guessing she began to become unhinged then.  The birth of your child and your husband's attention to the new child (the ""loss"" of her child to his new family) might have pushed her over the edge.  Hopefully she'll get perspective in sobriety and come back to make amends later."
"It's actually more likely that your parent's struggles led to your sister's problems, instead of the other way around.

Omg read that same story and years later the boyfriend who abandoned his long term girlfriend ended up becoming his boss lmaoooo he ended up basically being pushed into quitting.
That makes no sense.  If he loses his job will you divorce because the marriage isn’t legitimate without him having stable employment?  Then remarry when he gets a job again?  Wtf does stable employment have to do with being married when you’ve already made the relationship work without being married? I’m honestly annoyed on your behalf.  
Huh? It's not your husband's friend fault that he bought a great gift instead of you. The idea of wanting to personally call him and berate him over it in addition to you previously ruining your husband's bday is giving you a bad look right now. Move to the next best gift and give your husband genuine support and excitement. 
"She knows your cousin raped you and she doesn't care. 

You may never get a clear answer from her. 

Sometimes, in order to get closure, we need to find it for ourselves, because the people that wronged us so horribly are incapable of giving it to us. Sometimes, the hurt they did to us was so profoundly awful *because* they could never explain to us why they did it, no matter how many times we asked, politely or angrily.

Your mother will likely never be able to explain to you how she tolerated you being raped by family, because it is intolerable. The human mind is capable of incredibly acrobatic feats in order to keep itself sane under intense pressure. It's likely that at some point before her death, your mother might crack and feel the weight of it all, but I wouldn't bank on this happening. It may only happen on her deathbed.

You don't need to explain it to her. She knows what happened and cannot comprehend it.

"A lot of women place ridiculous amount of importance on their wedding ring, because of culture and tradition and societal expectations.. also because they are going to be wearing it forever and it is something of great personal significance, so they may be super super picky about it.

I’d seriously consider if this might be the case. Or if the girlfriend is really THAT materialistic or that much of a red flag.

OP, you know her best.  Does she usually come across as a materialistic person?  Does she try to be equal partners with you and give as good as she gets? How are you guys about splitting bills, chores, gift giving, planning dates, etc? Does she expect you to be the one putting in most of the money and effort?  

If this is typical behaviour, run for the hills. 

If this is atypical behaviour then I wouldn’t necessarily see it as a red flag.  Some women are just like this about their wedding rings because of societal/cultural expectations .  Tell her how hurt you are that the ring is more important to her than you.  Ask if it’s ok to give her a placeholder wedding band for now and promise that you’ll be setting money aside for her ring and set a timeline. Something reasonable like that.  Is it unfair? Yes. However it’s also unfair that people expect the man to propose to the woman, yet it’s generally accepted. So it’s more of. Are you ok accepting this one unfair practice that seems to be important to her? 

Personally I think it’s kind of bullshit (my husband’s ring is more expensive than mine and both are less than 1k and we mutually decided to marry, no proposal) but everyone has their irrational sides so shrugs. "
"One year married, which adds to the red flags "
This!! My first thought when he kept talking about the cheating is that he probably is cheating and projecting it on her. 
"Right?! So many times I have seen my friends wives leave.
They tell husband either we are going home now, you sleep at the party, or you find another way home. "
"Wow, he really has some nerve telling you that you need to put effort into trusting him while he walks all over you and does what he wants and doesn’t have to face any consequences. He’s going to be doing this as long as you are with him. People don’t do this repeatedly to someone they love, they just don’t. "
"Your post is riddled with excuses. Little stories you are telling yourself to protect yourself from rejection by pre-rejecting everyone else and letting you stay comfortable, protect your pride, and not change. I am just guessing, but I feel like I know because I have been there.

Here are your supporting arguments:

* we clearly would have been an imposition
* we hadn't been invited or we'd have to rudely invite ourself
* Also, my wife are introvert-extroverts

Here is your conclusion:

* My wife and I are always afterthoughts
* We just don't fit into anyone's social circles anymore

That's your story, not anyone else's. You need to find a good therapist who will kick your butt, or do it yourself somehow. You are stuck, and making every excuse to stay stuck. Even introvert-extroverts (or whatever) can learn how to give off positive energy that people want to be around. You don't need to be social butterflies."
"Firstly, I recommend Adult Children of Alcoholics, as another user has already stated. The groups are free, and twelve step has proven integral to many people’s recovery from addiction. 

Second, your fiancé is willing to change his behavior, but you don’t want him to do it for your sake. It’s okay to be a little selfish when it comes to your health, and this is your mental health. Perhaps you can have a sort of middle ground and set a boundary: he can go out and drink with friends, but he can’t come home drunk.

Third, I would highly recommend doing some research into basic DBT and mindfulness methods. These techniques, when put into practice, can be extremely helpful for people with flashbacks. They can be fairly simple. Two off the top of my head: the “counting” method, name five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can feel, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste; and the ice trick, where you put an ice pack/frozen towel on the back of your neck. These are supposed to help you focus on the present.

I think the ultimate goal should be to get into therapy, but that’s not always an option. Until that’s possible, these three things may be of use to you. I’m so sorry for what happened, and I’m glad that you’ve found such a healthy relationship. It really seems like he truly cares about you, and I’m sure that he’ll be happy to be a part of your healing journey. Be honest about your needs, and you can encourage him to do the same, this can open up meaningful lines of communication, which will help immensely with the future. 

Best of luck to you, your partner, and your recovery."
"This might be a win-win situation. It's kinda tacky to re give a ring that you previously gave to someone else. Most than likely he'd have to sell it at a much reduced price than he bought it for. If you buy the ring from him you'd be saving him some money. I would definitely go for it, but be prepared to get rid of it. He's going to get emotional and having a financial negotiation about a ring is probably going to be the last thing he wants to talk about."
"&gt;he says that he isn't sexual satisfied with me because of his foot fetish and i am not willing to continue to have my feet done at all times and the color polish that he likes. i told him he should pay for my pedicures if that is something that he likes for me to have on a consistent basis. he feels like i should just do it because it is what he likes and he shouldn't have to pay for it.

This is NOT okay. He told you he's not sexually satisfied with you because he's unwilling to compromise? You should pay for pedicures to fulfill his sexual fetish? No. His behavior is concerning, not the fetish but how he's treating you due to his fetish. He sounds manipulative. 

This doesn't sound like a healthy relationship. Your boyfriend is unwilling to compromise with you, he told you he's not sexually satisfied with you due to his fetish.

There's nothing wrong with having a fetish, but how your boyfriend is going about his fetish and treating you is not okay."
"My mom was a child of a woman like this... 

I know she got a little better in her adulthood (honestly, and my and the rest of my siblings' advice/coaching), but when I was young, she was such a rule-follower, afraid to break any rules even if they were silly/ridiculous. She was so eager to please that anyone could walk all over her again and again and again. She also had next to NO communication skills when it came to resentment or anger, and she'd either be passive aggressive and hope you got the hint or blow up completely because of everything that had been bottled up. 

She's happy and healthy and a *wonderful* woman, but she would have had a much, much easier childhood and early adulthood if she had not been so afraid to be a little assertive at the right times. 
"
"I don't think that talking to the step dad would be a bad idea.  If he knew that OP heard the comment he would probably feel terrible and apologize.  It would help to open up the air and, if step dad knew OP's feelings, would make it more likely that the relationship would continue."
"Yeah, if we're reading that right and that is the timeline of the divorce + new relationships, it seems reasonable for the new husband to be sensitive to this and not feel very secure about the relationship."
I’m his age and he sounds too controlling...
"Agreed.

I have a friend who when we ask him about making plans always says, ""I gotta check with 'the boss' and I'll let you know."" It's harmless and doesn't mean he thinks of his wife as a buzzkill. It's just that she knows the schedule better than him and lets him know what that week's activities are for the kids. 

What bothers me more is that OP's husband isn't upset that this girl basically threatened his wife. I would expect my husband to confront her and let her know how out of line it was - drunk or not. "
"Doing the same thing repeatedly, and getting the same result, isn't smart.  Just because you've marginally improved each time doesn't mean you know the material better, it likely means you've gotten used to the questions.  You really should try something different after 4 tries."
"Honestly, while the first part (saying 'santa isn't real' in the movie theater) isn't necessarily something to get worked up over, the fact that you failed to recognize that it honestly upset your boyfriend and you instead said something callous that made it worse is something you should be worried about. Even if what you said is technically correct (that kids do eventually learn santa isn't real), it was a very hurtful thing to say right at that moment. And honestly, the fact that you lacked the situational awareness to recognize that is worrying, and probably a sign that this kind of thing (saying something when it's not the appropriate time to say it) is a problem in your relationship.

It's not always about being 'right' or 'wrong'. You should be able to recognize when your partner is upset about something, and try to help them feel better. All of this could have been solved with a simple 'sorry honey, I didn't realize that it upset you this much.' Because that is the truth! You didn't know it upset him that much! But helping to make him feel better when you have done something hurtful to him will go a long way towards keeping your relationship healthy and happy.

(Please note that you shouldn't do this all the time, because 'being the one to apologize for any time your partner is mad' is a sign of abuse. But relationships are about give and take, and when your otherwise healthy relationship is on the rocks because you said 'santa isn't real', maybe it's time to say 'I didn't know that bothered you so much, sorry.')"
"It is very common for mothers with infants this young to only have their own mother around shortly after giving birth.

Honestly, I think your family is being too pushy. I know you want to see the baby, but she is so young, your SIL just gave birth and is probably constantly exhausted, and expending energy on interfacing with your big, loud family is most likely a draining prospect for her.

Also, your brother gave your mom a perfectly viable option to see the baby and she turned it down, which is just petty in my opinion. She asked to see the baby and then refused when it wasn't exactly how she wanted it to be.

It's only a month until Christmas, let her recuperate and love on the baby then. You're not going to ""not have a good relationship"" with her because you aren't seeing her at 3 months old."
"His mother actually is a waitress, so maybe that does have something to do with it. I have no issue with him wanting to tip more, but it feels so rude for him to dictate how much I tip. He's never had an issue with me leaving 20% before, though. Although he always seems to doubt me when I say I left 20% or he'll remind me to leave 20%. I don't know why he thinks I'm not going to tip well."
"Yeah I've been wondering if maybe it's just him trying to put me off the trail, but I also kind of just want to tell him it's in the next six months or bust. I don't know if it's unfair to set that ultimatum though."
"Give a gift without expecting anything in return. A person is not obligated to use a gift just because it has been given to them. I have been given lots of gifts that I did not end up using. 


As far as the collage, I think that sounds like a lovely gift. But don't do it just because your fiancees family ""is cheap,"" do it because that is something you think they would really want/appreciate."
"I have a friend who's been married 20 years.  Has a kid.  I was best man at his wedding.

For 20 years, he's been talking to me about redheads.  Every time he sends me a pic of a cute girl, it's a redhead.  Not a bottle redhead - a real ginger, with milky skin and freckles.  He's been unbelievabably consistent about it.  Most people change a bit with time, but not my buddy, not on this issue.  

His wife's a brunette.  She fools with the Clairol every so often, but it can't make her the green-eyed, pale, firecrotch fairy that my buddy so obviously has longed for all his life.

I feel sorry for both of them.  Why did they do that to each other?"
It is pretty shitty to only tell people if they are pregnant. Don’t you think not pregnant people deserve to know too? 
"There are enough accident children in the world born to parents who were young, wholly unprepared and pressured into parenthood because of morality/guilt. Well, you don't get any points for living life on hard mode. You need to really consider how you want your future to be. Do you want to be a single parent at 22, with an unwilling tinder match sperm donor? Do you understand how much that choice can limit you in the future? School, career, relationships and passions will sit on the back burner indefinitely. You will lose sleep, self care and possibly your sense of identity. You might loshe the chance at having bio children with someone you love in the context of marriage, children you would be in a much better position to provide for. Try to be pragmatic here. What kind of future do you want? 

Either way it's truly up to you now. And get yourself on some reliable birth control afterwards. IUDs are wonderful inventions."
"Great suggestion, thank you."
"OP, at this point I think you need to be proactive. Call a marriage counselor or therapist today and make an appointment. Then come home and tell you wife that you are very sorry, you are committed to you marriage and you would like to go to counseling together. 

I think you made a mistake but not a relationship ending one. In my opinion even the most well adjusted couples can benefit from counseling. Making the appointment and going will show that you are ready to take actionable steps towards growing together as a couple and making sure that this doesn't happen again. "
The subset of relationships posted here generally aren’t the ones doing well.
"Oh I'd love to make as much as a doctor makes too but I did not work for it. Nor did you work as hard nor did you consider maybe having a child with no means to support one is not a good idea. Basic facts, is it takes hard work, blood sweat and tears, to become a doctor. You think they don't get anxiety and depression? You have skated by this far, what would you do if you had to support yourself and your child should your mother decide to renege support or even worse, pass away? 

You can only blame your lack of opportunities so much before the responsibility is personal. 
"
"Honestly, would that even be a bad thing if she does go through with her plans? 

I couldn't stand up next to a couple getting married if I knew the bride was purposely keeping something like this from him while making me 100% complicit. 

These things always come out. There is likely to be photos. Do not become her scaregoat when things go to shit and the husband finds out. "
Is there a better place to post it?
That's not a decision you have to make right now. Do what you need to to stay healthy and sane. This is your timeline. 
"How often does this happen?

One of the things that really stuck out to me is the difference in lifestyle between you and your boyfriend. It seems like you're looking for a relationship with cosy nights at home, cuddled up on the sofa. He is looking for a side-car to his main event, which is hanging with his friends (case in point: his plans with you come after his plans with his friends in the evening schedule). Seems like you guys have completely different priorities. 

You're not wrong when you say he would rather be with his friends than with you. That's what he is telling you via his behavior and choices. What you do with that information is up to you. 

I agree that it's shitty the way he phrases it, which leaves you with no choices. But I think the actual issue is that your priority is the relationship, and his priority is his friends. "
"&gt; ""A 14 week old unborn baby's feet are this big""

"Tell him to fuck off and block all contact with him.

You deserve better. "
"Lmao. 

Honestly all there is to say. Life is to short to debate with someone like you who is almost certainly concern trolling. 

If you're so concerned for the kids, you should be much more concerned that the wife brought them in contact with LITERAL VIOLENT ABUSERS THAT ADMITTED TO PHYSICSLLY HURTING SOMEOME BECAUSE THEY ARE WEAKER

"Honestly, a lack of drive can often be depression. People can be cheery and upbeat and still be depressed or anxious or whatever. The excessive phone use can be escapism - he might feel he needs something to occupy his mind or else he focuses on himself and his problems. OP mentioned he feels tortured and upset over his inability to do stuff - it could be ADD and depression over the symptoms.

Well, really all this wondering is meaningless and what he needs is a professional. I just wanted to offer a counter to the ""laziness"" suggestion. ""Laziness"" to the point of one's own detriment is more often than not a symptom of an issue, rather than just someone who doesn't care about doing anything. "
"It's not a choice, but she was mistaken about her sexuality. She identified as lesbian when she was actually bi."
"That post was the actual worst...as bad as the one guy who poured a jar of dead spiders on his girlfriend, knowing she had a deep-seated fear of them, and she burst into tears :/"
"I kind of see where you are coming from in this case. If this is really just a one time thing, well, we all goof up. If it is a case of her consistently being oblivious about her surroundings, I get why he would be upset. However, how he's handling it, according to OP's description, is not a good way to handle it. I think that if he is just tired of her not being aware of what is going on around her, he needs to have a talk, calmly, about that."
"I have this exact same problem. Even more embarrassing, it's happened at work during difficult conversations with my boss.

I've found that, as soon as I start getting teary, if I explain that it's just a physical reaction and I'm fine with continuing the conversation, most people are fine with pushing through it. It may seem a little weird to them at first, but once they see that I am actually still capable of having a rational discussion while I'm crying, they get over it.

If you haven't already, just explicitly explain the problem to your boyfriend (preferably when you're not in the middle of crying) and make sure he knows you're not doing it as a manipulation tactic. I've been accused of that before, and it sucks. Don't bottle things up for too long either, because that'll just make it worse when you finally do have the difficult conversation. Once you've had a few of these conversations and your boyfriend sees that you're still being reasonable during the crying fits, I'm sure he'll trust that you're not just being overdramatic or anything. Good luck!"
This should be way higher. People don't often understand that people don't want to hang out with you if even YOU don't want to hang out with you. Learn to love and appreciate the time you have with yourself and the rest will come naturally if you're putting forth even a little effort.
"Also in the long term.. how will the child react, treat and understand personal hygiene if his father doesn't do it?

"It's a shared home. If she wants 100% control with zero compromise, that my friend is called being single and living alone.

Since OP is married and living with his wife, they BOTH have a say who comes into the home. A compromise is the husband saying he won't have his niece over while his wife is at home. It is unreasonable to expect that that children can be banned forever from the home. 

What are you not getting about these facts?"
"My husband and I bought my ring very affordably at an antique store.  I went back a week or two later and bought him some sterling-silver bar-ware as an engagement present.  (He still uses them, too.)

Some of his friends' wives and fiancees were absolutely horrified with me when they found out.  ""Why did you do that?  You shouldn't buy a present for the guy!""  Yeah, okay, sure.

"Six months in and you're already living together and he's already stomping on your boundaries?

Your married brother who's living in his parent's house with his wife called you cheap?
Wow! Omg please leave him. If you fly back to Germany the US won't pull you back for a custody hearing. The fact your gut tells you that you can't trust him is really telling and I think you need to get away from him. He sounds dangerous. Quietly wrap up your affairs and go home. Don't tell anyone just be gone one day.
"First up, I'm so sorry for the loss of your sister. But more relevant to your post, your dad sounds like a really good man. If my husband hit our daughter in the face I would react the exact same way as your dad did. I would *destroy* anyone who hurt my baby, even their own parent. 

Thirdly, your mom punched you in the face. It probably didn't take much to see that she isn't fit for custody of you. This isn't something that your dad and his lawyers did to her. This is the natural consequence of her own action. 

Fourthly, your dad is an adult and can sleep around if he wants to and his parents can suck lemons. But it actually sounds like he's being very responsible and keeping his dating life separate from his children. 

Fifth, and I'm sorry but:

&gt;How can I get them to stop feeling this way about dad?

You can't. Very simple. You cannot control other people. You cannot make other people do anything. You cannot force other people to change their minds or their opinions. What you can (and should) do is tell your grandparents to knock it off. Tell them that your dads dating life is none of their business. Tell them that if they don't stop trying to cause problems then you're going to stop speaking to them too. "
"Yeah, I didn't say that.

If someone is suicidal they should say ""I'm feeling suicidal"".

"Yeah, that's the thing that bothers me about this interaction. It seems so simple for him to say 'ah shoot, I was looking forward to time alone  tonight when you went out' instead of being a pest and having the situation escalate. I think that's probably the best way to frame it to him - he had two choices 1) be honest about his desires &amp; let the chips fall where they may 2) bully you into making the choice to go out and wind up with a crying wife. Why would you ever choose option 2??"

"Putting a pet on credit is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard. Your sister is a moron.  Also how the hell were you supposed to know that you had to make payments on the dog if she told you she got him for free?

Is there any chance that the dog will be repossessed?  Because if so I might try to find a way to take over the payments, even though I don't think you are responsible for them.  If not, I think you should refuse to discuss it with your sister and tell your side of the story to anyone who asks you about it. But I think the most important thing is to find out more information about what could happen to the dog if your sister doesn't pay the rest of the money.

Also, and you probably know this, do not under any circumstances offer to co-sign a mortgage or any other loans with your sister."
It also sounds like he'd date his friend if she wasnt gay.

They do?? I don't?? I've never heard that this is a thing everyone does

"Jesus Christ, you should dump him based on that statement alone.  He thinks he can shit all over you to make you take him back.  Fuck that guy, he's human garbage.

Honestly that's why he went after a teenager when you first started dating, because then he could neg you in your formative years.  I bet your attitude about yourself comes from him.

Please please please get rid of him.  Maybe get some help or therapy.  You've been with an emotional blackhole as long as you've been an adult.  Run away. "

"There are different words for ""good looking"" depending on what kind of traits you want to point out. Handsome is used to describe someone with masculine traits.

"&gt; He said if he were in my position, he would be able to be happy for me.

Yeah, that's easy for him to say because he's never been in your shoes. The big thing that stands out to me here is his lack of empathy for you. Now, perhaps you've been shielding him from your true feelings and how you're dealing with everything. That is not uncommon for people who have grown up in dysfunctional households to feel the need to diminish their feelings/needs or to not burden another person with it. So, you need to talk to him about what you wrote here. Explain how you feel, why, how it's affecting you, etc. A man worth your time will listen, care for you, and empathize even if he can't fully understand your past. He will be supportive and communicative. If your boyfriend is dismissive of your feelings or downplays it or tells you that you shouldn't feel the way you feel or should be happy for him because xyz, then he's not your forever person. 

You've been together for only six months so far. It takes a while for the entirety of a person's character to come to light and for you to assess whether they are, in their entirety, the person you want to do life with. People are on their best behavior for the first bit of a relationship, and you're seeing them through rose colored glasses. 

You also have to be understanding that it may be too soon for him at six months to include you in holiday gatherings, while something outside the day-of (and thus ""not a holiday gathering"") is okay. But you should be able to communicate together about that, and have a reasonable timeline of when you can be expected to be included. I personally would have invited you. I invited my long-term ex to Easter after we had only been dating a month because he lived far away from family and would otherwise be alone. But, everyone's different.

What you should absolutely do is be proactive and make some plans for yourself for Christmas. You say you've gone to friends' houses in the past. Reach out to your friends and get something set up so you *know* you won't be alone.  "

"It probably won’t matter to him till it happens to him... I was so guilty of using my phone while driving until three months ago. I lost control of my vehicle, swiped another car, skidded off the highway and slammed into some trees. I totaled my car but miraculously didn’t hurt the other driver and only had minor injuries myself...

I feel like the world’s biggest piece of shit. I could have killed the other driver, or myself. I could have maimed them. I am so grateful that we all walked away and have been carrying around a large amount of guilt, shame and anxiety since. I keep thinking “what if she had her kids in the car?” And “what if I had looked up one second later?”

Let your bf read this. Maybe it will help him. Maybe it won’t until he learns it the hard way, but I hope he makes better choices than I did.

That way you can argue that they're asking to share a bed, not fuck, so if your daughter suddenly doesn't want to it's pretty evident what she was trying to do. But at the same time at that age they're having sex probably, and if it's not in the house then it's somewhere in the streets. I think after a certain point you have to stop trying the *prevention* method for your child's sex life and eventually move on to *harm reduction*


When I eventually have kids and they're about 16 I figure the rule will be something like ""we don't want to catch / hear you doing anything that you wouldn't want to see / hear your mother and I doing to each other."""
"I think most people are going to tell you that you're going to be on your own with this baby. Unless you have a very strong support system such as family, then you will be a single mother. You can't force other people to get better. The only indication that he is interested at all is when you said he got a little better when he found out you were pregnant. Whether that boost  of energy was sincere or out of a sense of ""well, this is my life now,"" only he can say. "
"Forgive me, I'm trying really hard to be gentle here, but that's not your decision to make. He's made his situation clear and wants space, so if you genuinely care about his well-being then you'll let go, move on, and BACK OFF."
"Wait is my boyfriend the only one who wraps a strip of an old bear skin rug around his dick whenever he doesn't wear a condom?

Oops, bare. "
"Stop with the friend zone nonsense. It's an idiotic expression. Most of our relationships including people we are sexually involved would fall inside of the ""friendzone.""

So you mad she's acting like a friend? If you can't deal with it then let her know you can't handle it and block her.  "
You could make a seitan roast or oat/lentil/mushroom 'meat' loaf. Personally I'm making a pie with mushrooms etc. because my family is scared of meat substitutes and i don't want them to see being vegetarian as hard or scary :)
"But she's not sexually into women is she? So that's not fair at all, Cause you have desires for both genders and want to be fulfilled in both of them but you are trying to limit her to only what you say is okay, which is a much smaller list than yours."
"When I met my now-husband we had only been dating a few months when the holidays rolled around.  We had initially talked about our plans early on and I said I'd prefer to celebrate separately.  I wanted to keep my holidays simple.  However, I found out shortly before Thanksgiving that my husband had no-one to celebrate holidays with.  His mom and stepdad are snow birds and they went out of state from Nov. through the winter.  I was horrified and begged him to come to my family's holidays.  Sure, I had wanted to keep it simple, but I cared about him and he was *alone.*  I would never have been okay with him being left out once I knew the situation.  What I'm saying is, it makes me wonder how much your boyfriend really does care about you.  Because that's just not something someone would do when they care about their partner.  It should hurt him, if you feel hurt, but it doesn't.  If I was you, I would really need to assess the relationship, because that's just really hurtful behavior."
"Just to be clear, offering someone a ride then taking them somewhere against their will is exactly advocating kidnapping."
"&gt; He's not forcing them to be nude, 

It's not cool regardless. He's in a position of power over these people and thus his demands hold more weight. He should learn to back off and respect people's boundaries. "
"Deal with your own issues and stop victimising yourself as a martyr. She’s in hospital, let them take care of her.

As someone with mental health issues you really should consider the impact that body image has on mental health and how beneficial this elective surgery might be for her. She’s not making you be her caregiver: the doctors and nurses can do that. "
"I am and I’d feel like such a failure as a parent. I’d be hard pressed to go NC forever (my kid is a toddler so it is hard to imagine her being so cruel, because right now, she can’t be), but my focus would be the supporting the victimized kid and there’d be no rug sweeping. "
Linda? Check your names you may have used a real one when you didn’t mean to
"Honey, I'm sorry but what the fuck? You gotta get rid of him. He's still with her, he's just seeing you on the side. "
"She knows you want to.  She's making it possible for you to believe her, even though she's lying.  

Honestly, the fact that she lies to you to deceive you about things like this is more important than whether something actually happened.  "
"As a transwoman, the fact that she’s inconsistent and is effecting the people around her is a major problem and 100% on her. 

If she couldn’t come out to everyone why did she even come out at work? Why does she even care so much about pronoun use when she allows others to get away with it because she’s ‘not out’. 

Your HR needs to understand this and you might want to consider requesting that they get some outside help from one of the likely many lgbt advocacy groups around your area to help everyone figure out how to handle this. 

If you don’t have that kind of option then you might have to either prepare to be fired on a whim or quit. Either way you should make it clear that your colleague has poisoned the workplace and none of it has to do with her being transgender."
"No, no I am not *implying* that at all you’re simply choosing to *interpret* it that way.

The comments I’ve seen are what I’ve addressed and they’ve all contained undercurrents of anger and an attitude that women try to trick men into getting them pregnant.

Otherwise, agree to disagree - it’s weird and controlling. She doesn’t need to inform him that she’s making changes with her birth control so long as they don’t impact him.

It’s clear in this case the impact to him was, at most, greater piece of mind because it no longer needs to be taken everyday at the same time.

To be clear; yes, his concern over not taking it isn’t an issue.

To ask that question is fine, to hear that it’s still being taken care of *should* warrant no more than an “ok, cool”.

Instead this attitude of “you need to fill me in on the minutiae of what you do and now I’m all POed” is simply ridiculous.

The impact to him was the same if she switched from Tylenol to Advil so I’ll ask the same question again; ought she tell him about that, too?"
Wasn't there a post about a guy who didn't tell his wife about his vasectomy and made her take the pill or something?
"Ask him what if it was you. What if you were in a dire moment, and some prank caller took 3 minutes out of that ambulance's time. Out of *your* time. Your **life.** How would he feel then?

Honestly, I don't know if I'd even do that, this relationship would be over to me. But after so long together, only you can decide. "
It’s not super important but it does shed light on just how petty or mean she’s being and whether she handling her feelings appropriately. Given what you’ve said here I’d say that it seems that she’s not and has a history of talking about stuff that she shouldn’t. Definitely not okay no matter how she’s feeling. 
This happened to me.  When i went on the nuvaring my dad flipped out that he wasn't paying for me to have a diaphragm.  Still think your boyfriend overreacted though.
"&gt; I still trust him... 

Um, I don't even know what that means. Trust him to... what? Seriously, he's doing the exact thing he was doing before. "
"You just outlined my marriage. It was horrible,being stressed out, having to baby a grown person to help, it's horrible, horrible and it will not get better but it will get worse.

I also struggled with the whole how do I leave, what do I say, what are my options. Do I just come home one day and say ""I want a divorce"" that seems so cruel. How could I do this gently to not hurt his feelings. Blah blah.

I came home one day and said ""I want a divorce."" he tried to manipulate me for about 2 weeks to ask him to stay, I didn't budge and he left. Honestly, it's the only way do it, just say its and let the emotional cards fall where they fall.

I had also spoken with a family law lawyer before I broached divorce with my ex. So I knew my rights and I knew what to expect. 

Remember this, this breakup isn't clean, you will have to be a part of each other's lives forever, put your kid first. 

I don't particularly like my ex but we spend the kids birthdays together, Christmas and Thanksgiving because it makes those events less stressful to the kids and they can witness their parents being positive and happy both together and not together. "
#1: that was my thought too. Maybe it was to hurt her.
OP said she can't afford to replace the $40 coffee maker at the moment so I'm guessing any camera is going to be out of her budget. She could mention to her boyfriend when the other roommates are within earshot that she managed to set up that hidden camera. If it was one of them maybe they'll stop.
In other words -- a bad dog owner. 
"&gt; What do I do to pull myself out of this hole?

Go no contact and start moving on. In a few weeks, when you're a bit further in the griefing process, you'll realise what a jerk your bf actually is. Instead of being honest with you, he was basically stringing you along. I mean what was his ""excuse"" for never telling you that he loves you? Or what was his ""excuse"" for not integrating you into his social life? I mean you also carry a bit of the blame...why did you simply ignore those red flags?"
"yeah, I mean a simple ""oops, that was meant for my friend"" would have been fine and no cause for concern at all. But guilty conscience probably had him screw it up"
"Does he like her?  You have a lot of explanations for his behavior but it does read like she's just a bother to him.  Maybe you can talk to her about her worth outside of her father's opinion?

My mom never liked me and my father telling me over and over that I wasn't right about that didn't fix it.  "
"Let me tell you a little secret, based on experience.  This is going to get worse, not better.  My ex didn’t criticize our sex life, just everything else.  Welcome to your reality if you stay together. "
"I wish I had thought to say that! lol

He's no prize pony, that's for sure. "
"Didn't really tell her either, just mentioned the anniversary and got upset when she didn't read his mind. "
"No way to know. This sounds like something my friends and I might do, but we're generally very affectionate. 

The real issue here is that (I'm guessing?) you're uncomfortable and you need to address that with her if so. "
"No, it's not that complicated. You treated him to dinner.  He complained about how you never leave an unreasonably large tip, and gave you his acceptable tip range, the lower bound of which is at the high end of normal for average service.

You chose this option, yet he then continued to berate you for not being good enough, despite meeting his previously stated acceptable criteria.

Does this sound familiar?  It's a classic...

PETER: What are pieces of flair?

JOANNA: That's where you know, suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff.

We're, uh, we're actually required to wear fifteen pieces of flair.  Quite stupid actually.

PETER: Do you get to pick them out yourself?

JOANNA: Yeah. Yeah. Although I didn't actually choose these. I, uh, I just grabbed fifteen buttons and, uh, I don't even know what they say!  Y'know, I don't really care. I don't really like talking about my flair.

STAN: Now, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare minimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a terrific smile.

JOANNA: Huh. What do I think? Let me tell you what I think, Stan. If you want me to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over there, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of flair?

STAN: Well, I thought I remember you saying you wanted to express yourself.

JOANNA: Yeah. Yeah. Y'know what? I do. I do want to express myself. Ok? And I don't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it. (Flips him off.) All right? There's my flair! And this is me expressing myself!"
"He should be able to trust her, but he should also be much more informed and educated about birth control. ""Idk how the science of this stuff works"" is a juvenile level of uninvolvement."
Did you even read the post?
"I had a boyfriend once tell me he didn't like when I wore bright red lipstick. I sat him down calmly, asked him why he felt that way. We discussed why I choose to wear makeup, that it's my choice, I value his opinions and want to be attractive to him but in the end I will do what I want and not let him tell me how to look. It was a hard talk, but he realized he was being very judgemental based on appearance (he thought girls with obvious makeup were ""trying too hard""), was appreciative to hear my view on things, and accepted my stance.

Know what he never did (even before our talk)? Tell me to take the lipstick off. Or send me mean texts. Or leave me at a train station. Girl you shouldn't have even gotten past his first comment. He can say he thinks it's thick, but that doesn't mean you have to change it for his controlling ass. And he is a controlling ass, dump him."
"&gt;I then asked if he was comparing being hit in the balls to manslaughter, which he again declined to answer.

This is not even a conversation you two should be having. It isn't a question you should have to ask anyone, let alone your *husband*, someone who is supposed to love and care about you.

&gt;Should I expect to be hit back over something like this?

I think he has every intention of hurting you. "
"Surely your issues with addiction would make you more empathetic to her issues with academics, no? "
"You'd probably get better feedback in r/legaladvice. 


Not a lawyer, but I think she legally counts as a tenant which means that you can't just leave her stuff out on the curb &amp; change the locks. You'd have to go through the eviction process if she refuses to leave when confronted. "
Something tells me shes going to be feeling really dumb in a few months. Don't go back to her.
Together 10 years means you were 20 and he was 30 when it started? It’s entirely possible there’s stuff you don’t know about because you were 8 when he was an adult. 
"I honestly would break up with my boyfriend if he had views like this. 

He and I already had an argument just because he said he doesn’t like trial by media and thinks that they deserve a fair trial. I guess he wasn’t wrong but my instinct would be to believe the women first. Fortunately my bf does think what harvey weinstein and all those guys did were wrong and he said if he ever knew of something like that he would speak out for the women. 

But yeah, I would not tolerate it if my boyfriend thought like your husband. I’d probably make him read loads of things about rape culture and watch all of Law &amp; Order SVU or something. Ugh. "
"She's been on and off about everything. From having feelings for me to being physical. She flirted with me all day yesterday and then got angry later on at friend's apartment when I accidentally leaned on her because she ""wasn't in the mood for physical contact"" out of the blue. She's been trying to gaslight me, saying she never initiated any kind of physical contact, which is pure BS. She cuddled with me, kissed me, she even showered with me that morning. That's not something you generally do with platonic friends as an adult. She doesn't know what she wants and she steps on a lot of people without regard for their feelings. I should've seen this coming. Maybe you're right.aybe she did break up with me just to go and sleep with them. "
"&gt; 1k. And that definitely depreciates faster than that purse.

Yep! A lot of designer purses / bags retain their resale value. Phones do not. "
"&gt;I know that I should've told my wife

Yes you should have. 

The fact that you hid this is a breach of trust, and naturally makes your wife wonder what else you have been hiding and whether there is something there she needs to find out.

The trust between you guys is broken. You're going to have to work to rebuild it with her. I suggest getting into counseling. It should be helpful to have that third party mediator since other than concealing this you never really did anything wrong.

Thank you. It's just very awkward to talk about.
"

&gt; So that was my fault. 

its not ,since as you said.

&gt; since we never made any. "
Agree! Seems the MOH is secretly hoping OP tells her fiancee and gets dumped.
"In today's age, losing one's phone hardly prevents them from contacting their loved ones. If he really hasn't made contact with you in two months he may have just ghosted you... or something may have happened to him."
"Really have a look at this thread and your responses OP, maybe show your wife, because here you've shot down *yet another* totally reasonable suggestion. "
"Disagree. Flexibility is always a good quality but socializing out does not always and should not always take precedence over nights in. For introverts like myself, nights in with SOs is almost always more rewarding and fun for the relationship than nights out. "
It’s not normal because this relationship is not normal. He’s at a different place in life than you. This will continue to happen. People in these relationships always insist it’s not the age gap when it’s totally the age gap. These kind of mismatches when it comes to where you’re at in life will not stop happening. He’s. 30yr old dating a teenager. Gross.

"Yeah, frame it like this. Shitty that it has to be a woman that is ""his property"" to get him to have a reaction though."
"for legibility:

&gt;So quick backstory. I am pretty much what anyone on this planet would call an alcoholic, problem drinker, whatever you wanna label it, me and alcohol= bad news. I was sober when i met my girlfriend because i had a severe DUI and was wearing an alcohol monitor. I fell hard for her and decided being sober with her was better than drinking so i stayed sober for about 9 months. Slipped up when she was out of town lied about it. Things were good but i was sneaking bar time and lying about it. She caught on then it was a roller coaster of back and forth of being together and sober and lying and drinking and being apart. Finally our relatinship hit a point that we finally admitted was to toxic and walked away. We still very much loved each other but if i amdrinking i am not capable of being in a relationship. 3-4 months after we part ways I end up checking into the hospital with severe stomach pains. Turns out i had alcohol induced acute pancreatitis. I spent three weeks in the hospital being fed through a tube in my nose, not able to walk or use the bathroom on my own. The whole thimg was a miserable experience and its incredibly embarrassing. I only have no problem sharing here cus i dont know anyone who may read this.

&gt;So I get out of the hospital and we reconcile and she gives me another chance to stay sober and work things out. I obviously had reached out to her after detoxed and my painkillers were reduced a week into the whole thing. That was Jan-Feb. Fast forward to this past saturday. I agree to go to abirthday party for her friend/coworker. I meet everyone and the minute i am alone with her friends S/O he starts in on a story about his brother trying to drink himsrlf to death and how upset he was about it and he respects my choice to not drink, i never told him i dont drink just that i didnt want one. Confusion sets in cus the whole thing was uncomfortable. Why is this stranger disclosing this personal info? Why does he assume i just dont drink cus iturned down redbull and vodka? 

&gt;So I forget about it until tonight. I ask my GF if she told her friend that i was in the hospital. Before she can answer i know she has. I see it in her face. So i get upset. Not yelling and fighting, more what in the fuck?? I am an extremely private person and she knows this, I only share what is pertinent to a conversation. About anything. If i want someone to know something about my life, I tell them. If not, i give the cliffs notes version cus not everything needs to be shared. This particular thing is particularly embarrassing and its not something i advertise ,especially to strangers. Hell I didnt tell my mom i almost drank myself to death. So she doesnt understand why i am upset because my drinking affected her so she feels she should be able to share it if she wants. I explained that just saying that drinking has caused problems in our relationship so therefore i quit. She doesnt see my desire to keep this thing, which i am conpletely ashamed of such a secret. I explained i dont want sypmathetic looks or stories about other people like me. Especially from people i have never met!!! 

&gt;Then she brings up old fights and escalates it into argument over past things that have been said. I attempt to get her to understand it from my point of view, shame and embarrassment, but she cant. She says she wont  tell anyone else but she still stands her ground that she is not exactly sorry for what i feel is oversharing but she is sorry that her friend told someone else and i was put in an awkward situation. So now she is super upset at me. I really feel like just saying that i dont drink cus it causes problems is really the only explanation needed. 

&gt;I should also add that we never talked about not telling anyone this. It was just implied and i thought understood that i didnt want her telling people. So that is my fault. Also i realize how my actions and self induced hospitilization affected her. I am not oblivious to that. I also know she is an oversharer as opposed to my being an undersharer. I guess it leaves me wondering just what and to who she shares things?? 

&gt;TL;DR: Am i wrong for being upset or should i have been ok with her telling gossipy friend/ coworker something about me i find embarrassing"
You sound toxic. Maybe there is a good reason she doesn't want to contact you directly. 
"Nip it in the *bud* though, not the *butt.* It's about stopping something before it ""blooms"" into something bigger, not biting a behind!"
"Yeah somehow I feel like he doesn’t really “see” just how much he’s gone for, because it doesn’t effect him.  He’s doing what he wants, not doing extra work alone.  I totally suggest following this advice and marking yourself several weekends (preferably in a row) on the calendar, so he can see just how daunting yet another upcoming weekend alone with the kid feels like! "
"If something's doesn't belong to you, you don't take it and aren't entitled to it. Is that logical enough for you?"
"You aren't going to like this but..  this is a you issue.  When at work, focus on work. Do your job.  Don't vent. Don't find your""confidant"" and bring them to a conference room to gossip.  Just do your job.  If you need to vent do it after work hours."
"sorry, why are you with a guy who lets his friends shout at you and calls you a loser to your face?

The problem isn't that he's letting his friends do these things, it's that you're sticking with someone who thinks this behaviour is acceptable."
"I'm not entirely sure what you mean here.  Let's say hypothetically he makes $6k a month, and she makes $2k.  If they have a 50/50 split, renting a place for $2k a month would cost her half her income, while it's only a third of his.  After student/auto loans (especially for hisnew car he'll insist she pay half of), utilities,etc, she could end up with little to no money to put into savings or buy personal things for herself, while he had several thousand dollars of fun money.  That's not fair to her if she would rather live more frugally, say at a place for $500 a month so that she has money to do other things she wants.  He'd have even more spending money in that scenario.  Seems like it could still lead to resentment from either party, but living based on the means of the lower earner is probably the best way to manage a 50/50 split.  (Personally I prefer combined finances once trust is built up because it makes me feel like part of a team.  I say that as the higher earner too, least you think it's just a greed thing.)

Also if divorce is an issue, it being his personal accounts vs joint accounts probably won't matter.  If he's that concerned about it, he should talk to a lawyer and see about a prenup."
"The scenario where he's keeping something from you is worst case  obviously and it's hard to conclude anything, but him keeping you from his family in strange ways is a sign towards this. Passing gifts through him is also super weird, again since he has such constant contact with them, why shouldn't you, being his girlfriend?

I've been cheated on by both my exes and during both times I was isolated from their friend / family circle. They would set boundaries like not having their friends know about me (bullshit excuses for this), and not wanting me to visit them at school/work unannounced (bullshit excuses for this, too). So something like keeping you separate from his family gives me that feeling.

This issue with the parents is its own topic, in a way, but when you put it with the fact that you only see him 2 days a week, and on *specific* days, it does give the impression he's not being honest with you. Either way, though, the issue with him seeing you so infrequently is troubling and I think the main point; I agree with what other posters are saying that the two of you expect different levels of closeness from this relationship.

"
"Yeah, no financial institution is going to give these two a loan for a $400K house based on their income. "
"She's seven months. She can handle it, and if you don't tell her she may mistakenly name the baby after a man who is unfaithful. These kinds of secrets should be revealed as soon as possible, there is never a valid reason to wait (in my opinion)."
"I took it back in the 80s (in high school), and honestly, I'd jump at the chance to ""relive old times"" once, especially on a NYE, and especially when I knew it was actually MDMA. (I'm assuming your husband did some research and bought it online from a reputable seller.) 
Hell yes, I'd love to try it again, and I probably *would* be bummed if my SO didn't want to join me.  
(It's not like you're not going to have a bad time, lol.)  
But, *of course*, doing *any* drug should be *only* your decision. "
"Put it this way. Had you died, neither he nor his girlfriend would have given a crap. In fact they probably would have been happy because he would have saved money from not needing to go through a divorce. So don't waste your energy caring about him (or her).

Focus on nurturing relationships with people who deserve your attention, people who care about you.

Also why are you protecting their reputation? He had an affair with her. Why haven't you told people? "
"That's so upsetting to think about, but with his behavior nothing is impossible. He would have 100% blamed OP had something happened to her though he would have been at fault for being a horrible partner and not making sure his wife got home safely, though he would never take responsibility for his actions which is very clear by OP's post. "
"The way he emphasized about how fun the ""other wives"" were being, it sounds like he already has eyes for them if not already banging some of them. "
"Okay so I've been in a similar position before (wasn't in a relationship, though) where I blacked out and woke up next to a co-worker. First thing I asked was ""....did we have sex?"" I really think that'd be the first thing out of his mouth upon waking up in that position. If they both woke up naked (or close to naked in his case) in the same bed it's probably pretty safe to say they at least did *something* sexual. Maybe he was too intoxicated to actually do the deed, but I mean, she *was* naked, and she had to have gotten up to the room somehow, right? I know you mentioned the possibility of being drugged, but if he's not been more sick than a normal hangover, he probably wasn't. Date rape drugs will make you sleep for a long time and will usually make you very ill. 

I also wonder where his friends come into play here. They had to have realized something was going on? Has he tried to piece together what happened? Where was his other friend who was splitting the room? Do they remember him going up to the room with this lady? 

The decision to leave or to stay is completely up to you. I do think it's a good thing that he told you right away and he seems to be really sorry. But, I would be cautious. I do think you should try to piece together what happened from his friends. From my experience on both sides, I don't have reason to believe relationships can come back from infidelity. Any time you see a mention of the city he was in when it happened, whether it be in a commercial, or in a movie, you're going to think of him cheating. Any time he goes out with his friends, you're going to be worried. He's also going to live with this crazy guilt that may consume him. I guess it's just up to you where you want to go with it. I wish you luck and I'm sorry you're in this shitty situation :( "
"&gt;I don't think you did anything wrong

He flirted with this employee because he enjoyed her attention and thought she was beautiful. He let her flirt with him. He drove her home alone after she propositioned him. He ""turned her down"" by thanking her and saying he was flattered, rather than shutting her down after she offered him an open invitation to cheat on his wife whenever he wanted. 

He did *a lot* wrong. "
"LOL. Sounds like she liked him fine long distance but got tired of him in person after 8 mos. He lost a lot of sympathy from me when his first complaint was ""she stopped wearing lingerie all the time and our sex life isn't enough."" Everything afterwards was a pretty legit complaint and makes her sound awful but we don't really know what he is counting in that 25k. It can be everything from paying her car insurance to CVS bills. I am not sure why he is asking us about whether to divorce. She moved home dude. She is done. Just call and take her off the cc and the bank accounts."
"To be very frank, the house is for her. I like where we live but because it's ""soulless"" she's always hated it. I've never, ever minded supporter her in her art but after 5 years of her doing it full time, she's made maybe $5000 total and it's hard to hear her criticizing me over my potential reduced contribution. 

No kids now, we would lose some potential benefits provided by my company like 401k and health insurance but we could do that on our own. 

Podcast may not last long term but I can always go back to being an engineer. "
"Her mother punched her.  No matter how bad shit was it doesn’t justify PUNCHING a child over a broken vase.

None of this is OP’s cross to bear."
"&gt; 22 and not getting any younger 

I seriously spat out my tea. 

Girl I have been planning for the entirety of my adult life to create a stable, loving environment to bring a child into. I'm twenty-seven now and I'm aiming to have my first within the next few years. I can assure you that at 22, I was in no condition to have a kid, maturity wise. Let alone at 19. You have the right idea. Don't let this dude sway you."
"I would be very, very skeptical of the condoms. Obviously you know him better than a bunch of strangers on reddit, but I would be concerned that he might try to poke holes. Has he tried pressuring you in any way to have sex without protection? "
"Honestly, OP, I'm a little concerned by the fact that your response to watching this man abuse his sister and get violent with other people is be jealous. Like, do you really want him to turn that sort of attention to you? Do you want him to start calling you a slut and a whore or assaulting people ""for you""? Is the way he treats his sister really what you think love looks like? Because it's not. That is not how you treat someone you love and care about. If he really loved her and cared about her he would want to her to grow and find a fulfilling relationship and have a happy life, but the only person he wants her to have a relationship with is himself. He doesn't care about her happiness, all he cares about is having control over her. 

What he is doing to her is abuse, full stop, no questions asked. And what he has done to other people is assault. He should have been arrested, apparently multiple times for his actions. How can you look at all of that and still call him a 

&gt;&gt;sweet, loving, caring, quiet kind of guy
? 

Clearly you need to dump this guy, but after that I think you need to do some serious thinking on why you were able to excuse this man's absolutely horrific treatment of other people in his life by saying that at least he's nice to you, and why your biggest problem with his awful, violent, misogynistic, abusive behavior is that he isn't giving you enough attention. Learning to recognize toxic behaviors in potential partners will be very beneficial for your long term happiness. "
"If her focus issue is dating, then maybe it would have been acceptable to say something like ""So, do you also feel comfortable arranging the mugs in your dates/bf's homes?"" Maybe she will make the connection sooner than later? And I mean not just about mugs, but say things to her that aren't rude, but that will give her a hint that she is doing things that may push guys away. I honestly believe that if she's begging for help and honesty, it's time you and your wife let her in on the truth. If I were her and I were to that point, I think I would be willing to hear the awful truth. She knows there is something wrong with her, but she obviously needs someone to tell her what that/those things are, since she isn't figuring it out on her own Like a commenter above said, it may be overwhelming to tell her everything at once...but then again, maybe it's best to get it over with. However, there has to be something positive you add to the talk, if you do it. I believe in always starting off these sorts of uncomfortable talks with saying some things about the person that are positives. For example with the mug thing-""Sheila, you are a very organized and tidy person. That is something most men appreciate in a mate. However, would you like it if someone came into your home and started rearranging things to their liking? People have things a certain way for a reason in their homes, and unless you are specifically asked to help change something, it's actually rude to do so."" Also, there are some things that she will assumedly be able to adjust about her personality and behavior will little effort...and there will be things that may need years of therapy to help her change. Discern which things you should point out as friends, and that maybe you can help her to notice and work through. And then recognize which things are deeply ingrained in her personality and are beyond your ability to help. Maybe suggest therapy to her? (If you mention whether or not she is in therapy, I apologize because I didn't notice)."
"Then she needs psychiatric help, not OP's boyfriend. Their relationship is inappropriate. He cannot be his ex-girlfriend's savior and main (and only??) source of emotional support. Sorry, but even in her examples, she's shown that he's consistently chosen her over OP. I cannot believe OP put up with this for as long as she has. "
"I'll share based on being like your girlfriend, some women just share a lot of things with their friends and don't see anything wrong. I'm one of them. My friends and I share everything, we need to vent and seek out advice. My husband is very private and had a hard time understanding why I needed to talk with other people, I didn't get why he didn't want to talk with his friends about certain things. Through marriage classes we have learned this is normal and we just have different boundaries. So we have established certain boundaries that we agree on. Don't make her feel like she's wrong for her boundaries and unless you've discussed before what your boundaries are this isn't something up break up over. Talk with her. Let her know she can talk about her business, but you don't want her talking to her friends about yours. Example I can give, I talk to my friends about issues I'm having in the bedroom (after my 3rd baby my libido dropped significantly) but I wouldn't talk about my husband's sex drive, things he has said, or things he likes. I don't talk to them about a subject unless my husband would be ok with it. In return my husband doesn't say anything anymore about why I would tell someone something. He just accepts we are different. Now if she breaks your agreement or you guys can't compromise, then I'd say consider leaving her. "
You're 20.  You were born into it.
"Yeah it's pretty obvious imo that he just doesn't wanna make himself look bad to his friends for leaving her behind so if she comes it looks like it was something they both wanted to attend. 

And dammit why do so many people out there seem to think that after having a C section you should just be up and ready to go no problem?? That's such a huge surgery to have and from what I've heard healing afterwards SUCKS. Medicine has changed since my mom had her 3 C-sections so things better be better afterwards but she also had a hysterectomy several years ago so she's had the surgery four times. I remember her healing after and it didn't look fun. Even coughing or sneezing would make her Yelp afterwards for 2-3 months after "
"I think it’s direct. If someone is acting like a child, it’s totally appropriate to call them out on that. If the behavior persists,  there’s only two options: treat them like a child, or leave."
"Thank you for your response!
So how would you respond? Confrontation? Breakup? Ultimatums? Just disappear...? 

The first guy I got cheated on by, I didn’t handle it right. I tried to make it work and one of my biggest regrets about it was I didn’t leave soon enough. But with him... things are a lot different. He puts genuine effort into our relationship and is very open about his stuff in general - aside from this, he has never given me any reason to doubt and I haven’t exactly made it easy. Until I made up my mind to quit going through his phone, I was that crazy girlfriend that would freak out over nothing. "
"Agreed, this is classic narcissism. I have a sibling who regularly does this kind of thing, and I've learned not to accept any gifts or favors from them whatsoever. "
"So i sent the link of the comic to him, and he refused to read it “why can’t you just talk to me like an actual adult” is the comment i got back. Honestly don’t know if I see a future here. "
"The first amendment says that congress may not pass laws restricting speech, religion, assembly, etc.  It does not say that your employer must allow you to do and say anything you want on company property.  
"
"Wow, yuck. What a bunch of jerky stuff to say. 

I'd ask him what's up: ""Hey husband, you've made some comments lately about how you like boobs that are smaller than mine, and they've really hurt my feelings. What's going on?"" "
"Sober, he’s never been a big drinker and had only been drinking fizzy drinks that evening. No drugs as far as I know either. 

Honestly the thought of him relaxing in my house right now, making fun of me and the ambulance responders, makes me sick. I get home from work at about 1am and I want to pack his shit up. I don’t know if in the uk I can kick a long term partner out or if he has rights since he’s lived here for years but I’m going to start looking it up."
We all have African DNA. It's kind of hard not to have it.
"Yes and as someone who comes from an emotionally abusive home, and who ended up marrying a covert narcissist, it's possible that OP's husband married her because she is selfish (according to her post and comments, perhaps so entitled, selfish and low on empathy as to qualify as diagnosable with NPD). Those of us who've been abused consistently often tend to be drawn to people like our primary abusers, even when we are trying not to. It's quite possible that her husband (like me), finally saw just how amazingly selfish she is. She connected with his abusers-I'd say that's a good signal to him that she's toxic as hell and he never realized it till now."
"&gt;  I feel like because I was so eager to take the easy way out and let her handle my problems for so long I've unleashed a monster on the world and don't know how to back down. 

The monster was already loose. You just decided to marry her.

I'm sure you don't want us to tell you to divorce her, but there's no way in hell I could be married to someone like this so I really don't know what other advice to give you."
"Maybe your family is a little jealous/resentful that you’re spending so much on your bf of 2.5 yrs and not them who you’ve known your entire life. Nothing wrong with that — it’s your money and you should do as you like, and you’ll have to just be okay that it ruffled a few feathers with your family."
Yes you need to go to the police as soon as possible.  Holy crap.  Could you imagine how terrible you would feel if you saw him on the news a year or two from now and knew you could have stopped it before any more kids got hurt?
"The therapist is a professional (supposedly). When someone gives you feedback as a client, the correct response is to thank them for their feedback and wish them well, not to give a bullshit non-apology that blames them for their feelings and passive aggressively suggest it's their fault because other people gave you good feedback. That is petty and completely unprofessional."
"Yeah, and we don't really have any way of saying whether OP's husband was actually being bad about this, or if his coworker is just trying to cause trouble by making it sound that way. 

People with a certain kind of personality love to think of reasons why the person they want should be with them instead of their actual SO. I had a friend show me dozens of pictures from some guy's facebook saying how fake and forced his smiles look in pictures with his GF and that proves that he isn't really happy with her. "
"Well I mean he wants to see his brother who comes down a handful of times a year and his father is having risky heart surgery. If New Years is the only time to get them together then it's the only time to get them together. It doesn't really have anything to do with NYE specifically, rather with good reason this is time he wants to spend with family and it just happens to be NYE. 

As for your GF, you offered a compromise and she refused. It's time to stop playing games and let her get over it on her own. If she's so self centered that she can't comprehend why on earth you would want to spend time with you dad/family at that time then she's not really worth the effort. "
"The answer is: she can't. OP isn't going to change her mother's personality, or her opinions on physical appearance. 

That's why a lot of people recommend going no-contact or low-contact with people like OP's mom. There is no magical ""fix all"" that will nakr OP's mom suddenly see te light and start treating her hubby with kindness and respect. Because you can't change another person.  But you can absolutely change your own situation. If you don't want to put up with your SO being belittled, then don't continue to put yourself in a situation where it will happen. "
"THIS, OP. Being sick has very few benefits, but one perk is that you basically have a doctor's note to get out of stuff you don't wanna do. 

Is your mom on a special diet? It is so hard to follow those guidelines when you aren't in charge of the food and how it's prepared. If she's neutropenic then she really shouldn't be eating anything served buffet or family style, and she definitely shouldn't be around a bunch of strangers in the middle of cold and flu season. A weak immune system  is a 100% valid reason for y'all to opt out of Crazy Aunt B's Random Church Thanksgiving™

"That right there is a perfect example of your levels of maturity, your obviously well, well ahead of him. Ask him if you’ve given any reasons why he should doubt you, i honestly doubt he will give you an honest legitimate reason as to why he has done this or felt the need to..I’m sorry to say but I think he has unresolved issues with someone or something and I don’t think he is ready to be in a trusting relationship :( "
"Yes, that's unreasonable and kind of childish.  The appropriate response is to tell your boyfriend not to bring them home, to hang out at their house.  That's reasonable.  He doesn't have to agree, but that's the reasonable request.  Asking them to use another door because you don't to see them but aren't willing to say they can't come over is kind of petulant.   

Tell your boyfriend that this is your house too and you'd rather they not come over.  If he wants to hang with them, they can go to their house five minutes away."
"&gt;I didn't feel like he should be making decisions in MY apartment.

That seems like a really cold way of viewing the situation.  Has it ever been your intention to make him part of your family?  Also, has it ever been your intention to view the apartment as belonging to you and her as a couple?  Instead of just *your* apartment?

&gt;I don't feel comfortable correcting her son. I don't know when or if its even appropriate.

Were there any conversations about this prior to her moving in?  Or any since?

&gt;To top everything off, she has also made me give up porn, gone through all my email accounts and looked at pictures that I had been sent by girls long before I knew her and somehow this was all my fault that she did it right during our anniversary and her birthday.

At face value, this seems controlling and possibly abusive, but given some of your other statements in your post, I do wonder if there's more to the story. 
"
Is there any way the phone call and the BIL thing was actually about a gift/surprise for you? 
"Right, he wouldn't be upset by this if it didn't cause him negative emotion, and he's totally off track by labelling her as ""irrational"".  I can see why this thing has gotten out of hand, and it sounds like OP has a lack of empathy, combined with believing that he's logical and rational just because he isn't yelling or crying.

Just be kind to your girlfriend.  I guarantee you aren't any more ""logical"" than she is, and it's time to get off the high horse.  I'm sure the more you say these things to her, the worse the relationship gets.  If you don't want this to be years of nonsense (or a breakup) you are gonna have to learn to communicate with kindness and empathy (and not deciding you are the ""logical partner"")."
"Okay, then keep doing exactly what you're doing and end up with the same results. I suggested a compromise that involves exactly what you mentioned you wanted above and you don't want to do that, so I'm not sure what to tell you unless you're just looking for people to tell you that you're right and he's wrong."
"Yeah and it's ALWAYS the most mean critical judgmental people who can't take it in return.  It's usually because their meanness comes from insecurity.  It gives this douche pleasure to see you upset.  In future throw it right back at him, I guarantee he won't be able to handle it.  And to make it even easier, next time you know you will see him, think of all the low hanging fruit he usually goes for like your appearance etc and prepare some really awesome insults to throw back ahead of time so he won't catch you off guard.  He'll quickly stop insulting once he realizes how painful it ends up being for him.  "
Exactly. Just don't play his game.
"Shit, I’d have this info buried 6 feet below me. I’m all for honesty, but this is pointless and only hurts those involved. "
"Yes, it's weird.  Sounds like you've got a momma's boy on your hands.  He's a parent now, he doesn't get to indulge in this behaviour.

I'd be tempted to tell him not to bother coming home from his mother's once he's well."
Leave her. Don't deal with this anymore. Stop setting yourself on fire to keep her warm. Your gf is a 33 year old adult and she'll figure out how to survive without you.
"You can build a big ass with calories and squats. 

Moreover, I've never heard dudes come home from the mall and say things to each other like ""I saw so many big asses tonight, if only I were single,"" I have definitely heard remarks like ""I saw so many incredible Asian girls at the show, man"" "
"So she doesn’t even have the motivation to *let you take her* to the library? As in she doesn’t even have to do anything to get there herself? Sounds like she just wants to complain about her job, but not actually do anything to improve the situation for herself. "
"Yeah, not sure what the result is and not blaming her, but it doesn't sound like he was happy at all in the marriage.

Doesn't excuse cheating; more therapy, an open marriage, divorce first then play, plenty of ways to go about this.

Though with a kid and a nearly sexless marriage trapping you, sounds like it sucks for everybody."
"Not OP, but it is not illegal to have money in countries other than your country of residence. There's really no such thing as an ""illegal"" bank account. (Of course money can be used in endeavours that are not legal, or are legal in themselves but not declared, whether onshore or off)."
Good luck with your novel. 
"Give her a heads up. ""I'm cutting back on expenses to save for bigger things. I won't be able to continue to pick up the bill each time; hopefully we can think of some romantic, free dates for that time.""

Her reaction will tell you all you need to know. Chances are she's gonna get huffy. Because this gal feels *entitled* to your money. "
"&gt;It’s inconvenient to him that you have needs. Not only does he want you to shut and go along with whatever he wants

This is how I feel. Like I am putting him out by wanting something other than what he is already given. 

I mean, he is kind and thoughtful. But anytime I request anything outside of the freely-given thoughtfulness, the world is ending."
I agree that this is the weirdest part.
Why doesn’t she go to a doctor? Why doesn’t she do her exercises?
"Honestly, he didn’t hide it from you, he even wanted to share the experience with you. You are fine to not want to do it, but he’s not in the wrong to want to, barring legality obviously. He’s not too old to do it as long as he’s physically well, and he just wants to have a good time, with you. If he does it still without you, I’d be supportive, seeing as he was so open to you about it. Don’t ruin his roll by making him feel bad during it, if you really don’t want him to do it, tell him directly. "
"The guy was an immature, insensitive, selfish idiot. What you could take as a positive aspect from pornography in general is that tastes are very wide. Some people are into women with small boobs; some aren't, and so on and so forth. There is no one Ideal Woman or Ideal Man for everyone because we are all individuals.

Just because this guy treated you badly and demanded you doesn't mean that every guy is going to do the same. If you're not ready for another relationship yet that's fine, work on yourself, think about what you really want out of a future partner, but don't waste any more of your time on this idiotic ex."
"She's done.  There's no hope for this relationship.  She's just stringing you along for her own agenda.  (My guess is she still wants something - gifts, part attendance - from you over the Christmas holiday.)

Tell her that the two of you should just call it quits now.  Then block her.  Don't waste your energy on a relationship that is over."
"You can't wait for him to ask you out again because given what happened it's unlikely he will. I'd just get him alone, explain that you thought he was joking and say you'd love to go out with him if he's still interested. "
"Unfortunately the fact of the matter is that supporting someone with so many issues as you do takes a lot out of you physically, emotionally and mentally. In order to do so you really need to commit a good portion of yourself to helping the other person and considering how young he is it would be extra hard. 

I don't think either you or him are at fault here, I just don't think that you guys are compatible. "
"Yeah after reading this post and your last post, I don't think you're overreacting. Honestly it sounds like the two of you are not compatible when it comes to finances. He doesn't seem to treat loans with the same sense of seriousness that you do. At the end of the day it doesn't matter who is right or wrong here though, because you're allowed to have the way he handles money be a dealbreaker."
"Or microwave the pills, or just plain force himself on her."
"This isn't legal advice and it certainly isn't moral advice. But just so you know, absent a court-approved custody agreement, you have very broad rights to act without the other parent's approval or knowledge within the US. You should speak with a family law attorney immediately. 

Also, start documenting any contact with your ex. Let his calls go to voicemail so they are recorded. Save texts and emails. "
Not wanting to be near a toxic person like this who will turn it around and blame OP again is not being a doormat. It’s just being smart.
"And now, you've just slipped down the slippery slope toward cliche-dom. 

I have sooooooo much in common with the PYT subordinate from work; I have nothing but shared history and a family in common with the 'ole ball-and-chain. Let's not mention the vows of fidelity I made to my wife; I'm trying to forget those."
"An Upvote for you Glenn Cocoa! ""You go Glenn Cocoa!"" Mean girl quoted because this deserves it"
My personal opinion is it's disrespectful for her to even meet up with him or have any type of contact with him. He disrespected your relationship together when he tried to kiss her. He disrespected her last relationship by cheating with her. Your threats we're way out of line and another topic entirely. She is being disrespectful towards you and your marriage. Don't keep friends who can't respect the boundaries of your relationship. 
"so do the anniversary a day before/after

He married his sugar daddy for a visa. Now he might be in trouble and acts all cutesy. He is going to continue meeting other guys if you forgive him.
"Yes! One if the taboo issues around dementia are violent outbursts even by people who were never violent before dementia got to them, against people they never wanted to hurt while still being unaffected. Would OP be able to deal with that? She shouldn't have to either way. OP, home care sounds like a terrible idea in this case even though you have to deal with a society that guilts relatives into the care taker role, especially sons and daughters. It wouldn't be a responsible solution. "
It's really a no-win situation. Either option sucks.
Let him know it scares you and offer to text for him. I do this with my husband and it works out. 
"THIS. Your mom would be exposed to a lot of strangers. Her immune system could be compromised. ""Avoid crowds"" on the list of medical recommendations?

"""Making my partner happy is a core part of my understanding of a healthy relationship.""

That is NOT a healthy relationships. A healthy relationship is about give and take, reciprocity, respecting them but asserting your own needs as well. You want to make them happy, sure, but they want to make you happy too. It's not a transactional relationship where you do X number of nice things for GF, and in return she grants you her company and sex. 

Also, I know people say all the time ""let her know you like her!"" That's not your problem. SHE IS NOT INTO YOU. But the fact that you think some compliments and dinners and loving gestures are going to change that is delusional. It just shows her that you're a wimpy, spineless guy who will put up with ANYthing for the promise of sex. 

Do you know what would probably turn her on more? If you stood up for yourself. Said ""listen, this isn't working. Clearly we're not sexually compatible, and I think we both deserve to be in a sexually fulfilling relationship. I don't know if you're interested in working towards that with me, but if not we should go our separate ways.""

"
"It's a little more complicated than that. We've both gone through periods of being broke and we've supported each other through them. Most of the time he has supported me. Only a couple of times have I had to support both of us. 

When we did both have jobs, we did split the rent. We also each paid for different things (I paid utilities, he paid for food and stuff for the cats). I wouldn't really say we mix our finances. We don't have a joint bank account or anything. We try to split things pretty evenly when we are both able to."
"Jesus, from what you described, his house is so bad that he deserved all that and more.

"Ugh, I'm sorry but you guys sound like the absolute worst. She gets pleasure out of berating and bullying people to get her way? And you thought it was okay because she's short and ""cute?"" Chicks like this with her sense of superiority and entitlement give other women a bad name. I don't see how you can change any of this. This is who she is and you were A-ok with it until she turns on you. Like, there is no sense of common courtesy and decency to other human beings? Having worked in some of service those jobs when I was younger I never understood how people like your wife could be so hateful. Now you've explained it. It's so she feels like she can win over 10 bucks. "
"I had a roommate issue a couple years ago and I literally just opened her bedroom door one day because my Ugg boots (which were a gift) had gone missing and they were right there on the floor. While I know it's an invasion of privacy, I think this is one of those situations where it's ok to do."

"He really needs to grow up. You cannot compromise on an animal. The sulking has got to stop. It is quite manipulative.

It does not seems like your collective lifestyle is conducive to dog ownership at this very moment. He needs to grow up and realize that.

Perhaps you guys can set a timeline but it seems like your living situation would need to change significantly."
"ARE you too thin? Sometimes we don't see ourselves the way the rest of the world does. Given you're not eating peanuts OR milk OR wheat, that's a lot of diet groups you're removing; and it's possible your husband is justifiably worried. 

Or - your husband is judging you by iffy standards and is way off base. 

Either way, a GP visit to check your bloods and vitals will help - either as a nudge to yourself to eat more nuts/fats/whatever; or a nudge to your husband to butt out. Consider it an investment in keeping yourself healthy for your baby, if you can't justify it otherwise. (And it's pretty dickish he didn't buy you the cheese, I will give you that. I'm annoyed FOR you. Having no cheese in the house is supes depressing.)"

"It'd be one thing if it was OP's decision based on health, it's now ... weird and awful because like OP's husband has an opinion on what size and what cup he wants.  It's like he's putting in his order for the best type of breasts he wants to play with.

Like, tbh, if you were getting a reduction for back and shoulder pain, dropping down to B or C would be a better idea than a D cup.  "
Time to end that relationship. There's nothing to be done. Don't be friends with people that insane.
"Not 8 months of *her* salary, to be clear. 8 months of what would be ""average"" salary. Not a terribly helpful metric without knowing what portion of her own, actual salary that is. She used it to make it sound like a lot, to justify why she's concerned about supporting her boyfriend in addition to all these other ""expenses,"" but if just makes her sound like she doesn't really care about her money when it comes to being generous to people she cares about. Either that or she's really irresponsible with money, *or* she has so much she can afford not to care.

So... yeah."

"IMO this is all on her.

You were clear in what you wanted (a nice dinner and movie with her). She apparently was not honest (she seemed excited but secretly doesn't want to stay home on Saturday).

When these alternate plans came up, you were accommodating but still made it clear you wanted to salvage some of your original plans. She was okay throwing out those plans without much thought.

I get the perspective of preferring to do stuff out, with others, vs staying at home with your SO. But this wasn't a case where you'd just be staying home - you had specific plans to do something together. If she wants to go out more or not be home on a Saturday night, that's fine but she needs to communicate that to you. Otherwise it seems like you're her backup plan if there is nothing better to do."

THANK YOU for making this point! Married people should be equal partners. You shouldn’t need his permission to go 
"That's not how sleep disorders work... Everyone can go a day with no sleep without affecting their sleep schedule. It's not about being tired at X hour and fall sleep after 1 day, it's more about having a routine everyday. He's not trying to solve this at all. He HAS to wake up at, say, 10am EVERYDAY and go to bed at say 12pm following a routine (eg. wash his teeth, read a book chapter, drink a glass of warm milk...) EVERYDAY at thw same hour, even if he ends sleeping at 5am. He'll end up tuning his sleep schedule to it.

And if that doesn't work he has to go to a psychologist/doctor or someone who can help him adjust his sleep schedule. Maybe he needs sleeping pills while he does that so that he associates routine - sleep. Maybe he needs another treatment like putting off going to bed 2 hours everyday untill he ends up going to bed at 10pm. I don't know, I solved this with routine + a week of mild sleep pills, but his doctor will know what's better for him.

That is, if he actually WANTS to get a normal sleeping schedule. Being able to sleep through any daytime responsibility may very well be the actual source of his sleep problem

"I have my best friend coming over tomorrow, and I didn't really want to bring this up with too many of my friends because I know it'll become gossip"
"That's really interesting, I never thought of that! I reckon you're right. He may have been holding a grudge because he paid the entirety of the accommodation costs (even though I offered??) and thought I should just automatically offer to 'shout him' all weekend, and if I didn't, *I was the bad guy*. I just can't believe he made not a single mention of this beforehand. I just assumed we'd do what we usually do, go 50/50, or have one person shout food, the other person pays for drinks, and then swap the next night etc...

I'm just wondering how he ever thought that forcing your girl to pay for the entirety of dinner, while on your first night out on holiday, would EVER be attractive?"
"I don't think your message was rude or anything, just to the point which is not necessarily a bad thing. I just don't think her message was any more blunt than yours. Her reply was fine and professional imo, perhaps bar the defensive bit where she says many people had positive experiences with her - but I don't see why you'd be so distressed about that line. What about the reply specifically upset you?"
"Talk to her family/friends. Let them know that you're breaking up with her because she cheated and that she's threatened suicide in the past, so you want them to be aware of that. Then break up with her and block her so she doesn't have a way to contact you. If she gets around it and threatens suicide, call the police.

Please don't think this is your responsibility. You need to get away from her ASAP - the chances of her actually hurting herself are much less likely than her just using it as a threat to keep you with her. This is abusive and you deserve better."
"First few paragraphs were full of red flags, and the best thing she said about him is, ""he seemed fine."" Keep an eye out for this pattern, OP. Not really into someone, and they make you uncomfortable. Double punch. "
"You're probably a lovely woman, but you aren't coming across too great in this post. Your lifestyle and general concerns are mostly unrelatable and shallow. 

I think you need to take a look at your relationship, and figure out why in the world this is an issue. I don't want to diss you or your problems, but if a quick conversation doesn't nip this in the bud, there may be more problems in your relationship than you realize. "
"The problem is that he could go on making payments for a hundred years, and still owe $60,000."
"Thank you for the thoughtful and nuanced reply. I agree pretty much 100% with your theory. Either way though, the outcome is the same. I’m super sad this is ending, but I need to get out of this relationship, and whatever he does next really isn’t my problem. "
Your ex is an asshole.
encountering someone who would ghost a girlfriend is like finding worm in your apple. Throw it away and be glad you didn't keep eating it. People do it because they 1. are extreme cowards 2. don't view other people's feelings as being as important as their own. There is nothing you can do. Trying to maintain contact only heightens his sense of importance and allows him to tell his friends he has another stalker. Stay away. Far far away. 
Yah lol what’s with the harshness in this thread 
You should head over to /r/JustNOMIL
"Right, it's like telling someone that you think they're ugly and then trying to take it back.  Some things just can't be taken back.  People don't just forget that stuff with time, it sticks there and eats away at them.

We all have likes, preferences, ugly judgments, etc.  The difference is that most adults know to keep their mouths shut about it.  "
It sounds like your sister may have an undiagnosed learning disability. She might be a better fit in a trade school or apprenticeship program. She should talk to her guidance counselor at school about both of these things.
/r/JUSTNOMIL would welcome your story and offer much support. 
"I understand that thank you for your advice. We do feel that way. It always feels like she’s choosing them over us, over her own kids. She’s upset now that we won’t have a relationship with her any more. "
"He didn't offer to pay for the wedding and we don't want to ask. They are not that well off actually. They are middle class. Even if I weren't helping my family with medical issues, the ring still wouldn't be affordable for me. I'm not American which you seem to be assuming. I lived with my parents until I was 25 and spent a considerable amount of time with my siblings. Though even if I didn't I would still want to help since they are my siblings. "
My mind jumped to child support...
"Probably, especially since OP seems to think the guy loved her even though he married someone else. But if I was the wife I would absolutely want to know, no matter what. "
"Right. Different families are different about when SO’s get invited, and to what events. Thanksgiving was pretty open, but Christmas morning was just family and people who were engaged to family. 

I get how the updates were hurtful but I think he could have been trying to stay connected and it backfired."
"I think decent parents are likely reluctant to disown their own children. It seems like they were very unhappy for 5 years and did not like what their daughter did, but after 7 years, they've probably accepted that Jeanne and Nicole are together for life (they've now outlasted OP and Nicole) and don't want the family to be divided forever. Unfortunately, it's not their decision to make, and the sister and ex-wife were cruel to OP on top of the affair: not telling him they were together, lying that he ""knew,"" making absolutely no effort to apologize or otherwise mend bridges, and dismissing his hurt and betrayal by insisting that he should put that aside and be happy for them immediately. 

OP gets to decide how much contact he has with his sister and ex-wife, and it would be 100% valid for him to decide he's never having any. I hope he has a decent support system outside of his family. "
"I got a serious tummy bug and was also hit by a car (just tapped really, but it shook me up) the night before we had to go to an out of town wedding. My fiance drove all the way there (14 hours, over the mountains), stopping every hour or so so that I could be unspeakably sick in a rest stop, supplied me with gatorade and fizzy water, and was incredibly sweet to me the whole time, even though I needed a lot of rest and wasn't a whole lot of fun the first few days we were there.

If my fiance had behaved like your boyfriend, I would have dumped him."
"&gt;He doesn't want me to get a job 

So he doesn't want you to support yourself. He doesn't want you to have funds to get yourself out of your relationship.

&gt;or have friends

So he's trying to isolate you. 

&gt;Won't even help me get my license.

So he doesn't want you to have your own transportation? Another way to make sure you fully rely on him for everything.

&gt;This is my first relationship.

First but not your last. You know this is unhealthy. This man is DOUBLE your age. He's grooming you to fully rely on him so that he can control you. Not only is it wrong, but it's creepy as hell.

&gt;I don't know if anyone will ever love me or want me like he has. I'm scared to be alone. I'm scared of life without him.

How many people do you know that only date one person and then marry them and stay together the rest of their lives? No one. He is manipulating you into thinking no one else will ever love you so you stay with him. You're 22 years old, you won't end up alone. Listen to your sister, she sounds smart."
"Exactly this - I imagine life is awkward because everyone is being so nice, but ultimately I'm sure you can work something out to still be 'grand' but a bit less awkward "
"To be fair, mothers can also be selfish narcissists, so, I wouldn't make any assumptions on the feelings of another person."
"Financial incompatabilities are often overlooked when dating but often cause huge problems when married or in a long-term relationship.

If possible please try to think of it as a bullet dodged, because yes this woman has red flags all over the place.

I'm sure this is a hard issue to talk to friends about. It's hard to convey all the facets of the situation without getting deep into it. Her friends are probably seeing it as ""he agreed to go on a holiday with her and then ditched her!"" because they don't know the whole truth that it was a horrible financial decision and she emotionally manipulated you into agreeing to go in the first place. Note: I originally put ""pressured"" but changed it to ""emotionally manipulated"" because she literally threatened the relationship if you didn't agree to go.

Maybe travel is really important to her but I still can't understand why she couldn't have planned a simpler, less expensive trip if she was really dying to go on a trip. Personally I would not want to be with someone who was okay with doing that.

Please do not let her bring you into the financial trainwreck she will undoubtedly cause for herself."
"It's totally valid for OP's own life to come first. Some people are not as into family and won't go chasing down relatives to find out about someone's game, etc. And that's fine!

Maybe it's just me, but some nephew's sports game not being a huge priority for OP doesn't necessarily mean his family is an afterthought."
"You can't control who your mom has a relationship with, but you are allowed to set your own boundaries about what your mom talks with you about.

Make it clear to your mother that if she brings up Kim around you, then you will not be talking to her for a while and that she needs to respect your boundary in this regards for the sake of the relationship.

If your mom continues to pretend like you and Kim are together on social media, call her out on this and tell her that since she is lying on social media that you have no choice but to block her.

Again, she can go out to lunch with whom she chooses, but when it starts to impact your life, you should feel free to set boundaries and withdraw contact when they are crossed."
You should just leave them both be.  There is nothing you can do.  It might even make things worse.  It's really awful but it's better IMO to just let them both grieve on their own. 
"&gt; he was freezing me out, being mean and nasty to me etc and I was miserable

Oh, thank god you got away from him. That behavior is unacceptable. Oops, wait.

&gt; because of him being addicted to marijuana, which basically was the root to his nasty behavior towards me

Okay...don't really buy this but fine if he's really willing to change.

&gt; After two weeks of being back together and everything is really good, I come home and he is furious with me

&gt; The day after my boyfriend goes bezerk on me because he went through all my stuff (again) and calls me a little, filthy liar and yells at me

Ah, so it's not marijuana, he's just an abusive asshole after all.

&gt; He doesn’t want to break up with me but he will never get over it 

Even if you had done something wrong, which you DID NOT (and he did by going through all your accounts without your permission, which is a disgusting violation of privacy), this is a really horrifying manipulation tactic. He doesn't trust you and will never forgive you, but is keeping you on the hook so you can...what? Grovel for the rest of your life? Cut out everyone in your life to make him more comfortable? Allow him to yell at you and call you names because you deserve it for daring to take a walk with a friend?

This man is controlling, cruel, and abusive. Someone who loves you doesn't invade your privacy, call you names, and hold completely innocuous things over your head in order to have power over you.

Please trust your initial instincts and get yourself away from him before this escalates further."
"Dietary issues are the worst. I actually had a teacher who had a similar small list of foods she could eat but as she got older her list got smaller that she just chalked up to developing more allergies.

"Often we recommend to tell one friend you trust the story and a script, something about how you don't know amd don't want to talk about it, and let that friend handle your other friends. "
5 years is a long time to accept things. 
"How should she reply?  This is social etiquette 101 stuff:

""I have removed your appointments from my schedule.  I wish you luck in finding a counselor that is a better fit for you.""

Done.

Don't attack OP because you (the counselor) cant handle having your *feelfeels* hurt.  Your ""of course she does X, you did Y"" is EXACTLY why she isnt that great of a counselor.  Good counselors arent emotionless, but they are able to temper their emotional response through self-discipline.  This counselor lacked it."
"I’m sorry, I don’t want to sound rude but reading this post and the original I am surprised that you’re 33. Have you had many relationships in the past? 

"
"I think it's more than rude, it's almost like a big con! I mean I don't buy expensive wedding gifts for my friends who are just in relationships, especially ones that seem as precarious as this one apparently is. If they had treated it as a common law marriage celebration and been up front about it that's different but they lied about their relationship's status and made people spend money and time on something that frankly has no chance of lasting. "
This. All I could think while reading this story is that it would be perfect on r/raisedbynarcissists.
"For what it's worth, I do recommend talking to SOMEONE now that he's gone. Talking to a third party might help you walk through your relationship and become more cognizant of red flags. This could help you avoid people like this in the future! 

I think in time you'll find that you loved his potential, not the man he actually was. I highly doubt you (or anyone) could genuinely love someone who is happy that they made you miserable. A therapist could potentially help you really move on from the mess he tried to turn you into. "
"He gets angry at people online, angry at bad drivers on the road. He gets angry when he's competitive, he gets angry when things don't happen like they should. I've told him he needs to see someone about it but he hates therapists. He has a lot of resentment in his heart. When it's good, it's great. When it's bad, it's awful. He's never violent, but he raises his voice, curses, and flips things over sometimes (like controllers or folders). I've never felt alright about it.

Whenever he would start doing that stuff to me I would put my foot down and let him know very clearly he is never to treat me that way. It's the single thing I've been unrelenting and strong about. He promised me the next time 'it became a problem' he would see someone about it but there have been little bursts that don't warrant a problem, but are enough to put me on edge. This is a problem he doesn't want to address for painful reasons I think, but it has definitely added to the problem of me not wanting to be with him in the long term unless he got help and figured it out.  "
"oh my, I almost forgot - that was terrible. Aswell as this relationship seemed to be. Good job OP for getting out :)"
"The boundary my husband and I set long ago which has worked well is that we wake up on Christmas in our own beds and spend Christmas morning alone.  

If your nieces and nephews aren't even at the IL's on Christmas morning, then there's absolutely no reason for you and your family to feel like you need to be there either.

"
"Look, you've tried talking to your friend about this before. He doesn't want to listen. Trying to talk with him about it again is only going to drive him away more. This is one of those situations where you need to let people make their own mistakes. You can't help your friend if he doesn't want help. "
"Stop talking to your ex, just block him and refuse to talk with him if he's present. I don't know why your boyfriend is encouraging you to talk to your ex but it's a bad idea, tell him that he's the one you love and that he needs to go talk to his therapist about putting your ex above himself."
"We did this too! While he was eating, we'd sneak a hand between his face and the bowl, and open it up to reveal a treat. My husband would also make the dog give him kisses (putting his nose to your face) while he was eating, and then giving him more treats so he would be fine with kids/other dogs putting their face in his while he eats. Now he's almost 3 and there is pretty much nothing you can do to make him uncomfortable or snappy (other than actually hurting him). The dogs in OPs story sound like a nightmare."
"I'm pretty poor so $400 is a lot, so on my level, if I saw my husband pulled $100 out of every check and I asked him what was up he'd be like ""oh yeah I just like having some cash if I go to the bar or to buy smokes with""

He wouldn't turn over and blow like some kind of engine and drive the hell away from the point of the conversation

His reaction clearly shows that he's specifically hiding something from you. Like you didn't even have to dig before you heard the THUD. Now you gotta uncover what's going on. If I had to guess he's blowing it at a bar or strip club or something. Or he has a secret savings account which on it's own is not the greatest sin but keeping anything secret from your life partner is not good. Best case, it's a surprise for you, but hope often does that shit happen?

Also, OP it's November. You can't even do taxes until January. What the fuck. Are you sure you weren't just snooping?"
"That would have been the best case scenario in this situation after he decided to abandon OP. Based on the behavior of her husband, I don't think I'd want to deal with his ""punishment"" after not coming home, because of course she would be blamed and insulted. "
"&gt; just a few hours ago she told me how happy she is with me and how much she fucking loves me and now this? I don't know where to start and what my next move is?What am I supposed to do now?

she cheated on you for 5 months.....she doesn't love you. you dodged a fucking bullet, end that shit. She would have continued cheating if tom didn't find out, i hope to god you end this shit"
"I suggest also posting on r/justnomil - it's for posting about unacceptable behavior by moms as well. The people there can give you a LOT of tips for dealing with this, and also for if there could be issues in future.

I also want to commend you for recognizing how not okay your mom's behavior is and even trying to call her on it, trying to defend your date and be compassionate for her and her feelings. There's a lot of people who struggle with that at twice your age."

I hope not. What 20 year old would like to be named Linda? 
"No, but people are framing it as a more frivolous / shallow purchase than electronic items in comparable price range (especially if we’re only considering the $700 coming from their joint budget.) Most people don’t bat an eye at spending that same amount on a new phone every two years, or a laptop, or a TV, or any other electronic item that will be outdated in a few short years &amp; will be replaced. But because this is a purse, people are judging it harshly, when in reality, a well-cared for quality purse will long outlast those other items I listed. "
"If she wanted to talk to you, she would have. Her actions speak clearly: she is not interested in you. She doesn't want to break the ice with you. She doesn't want to talk to you. Let it go. You obviously care about this whole thing way more than she does. 

You are the one being weird by hanging on to this. Move on. This whole situation warrants all of a passing thought along the lines of ""oh huh that's weird/funny/odd/whatever"". You're making a mountain out of a molehill here. Take a cue from her and just leave it be. "
"&gt;She was the creep

She left you alone. You, on the other hand, are now seemingly obsessed with getting to her by setting up a lunch so you can ""dish it out"" (funny you edited that from your post) and tell her she's weird when you're the one making it weird."
"&gt; he says that’s not a good enough answer— how do I respond? I find I’m exhausting myself from explaining and re-explaining my day to him.

""I've already told you"" / ""I'm done talking about this"" / ""Stop interrogating me"" -- and when he doesn't let up, you leave.

Your boyfriend doesn't trust you and is being abusive. If I were you, I'd call a friend that'll pick you up (from where you are right now) so you know that he won't escalate physically and leave with that person. "
DAAYYYUUUUUM.  mic drop.
"First off, I'm very sorry for the loss of your dog. 

I'm not sure how well you did or did not get along with your neighbor before this incident, but from an outsider's perspective it certainly looks like he was rather patient and gave the both of you a lot of courtesy before he finally took action. 

By the time he first approached the two of you about the dogs, he had said he had seen a ""whole damn lot"" of them within the last month. How often do you think? Once a week? Every day? He could have shot one or both of them on the very first offense and had been well within his rights to do so, especially given that the dogs are a direct threat to his livestock. 

Instead of making that decision, it seems like he tried to avoid that outcome, and once it became apparent that it was not at all an accident that the dogs were loose, he tried doing the neighborly thing by letting you know that it had become a problem. By the time he brought it to your attention, it had most likely become very disruptive for him.

Once he finally did take care of the problem himself, because your husband didn't, he did the right thing by calling the police and giving them all of the details and having it officially documented. He could have just as easily let your dog disappear and not have to deal with the police and owned up to his actions. 

Because of the way he handled it from the beginning, I'm willing to bet that he took no joy in putting the dog down. It seems more likely that he was doing everything he possibly could to avoid shooting someone's dog. Your husband just didn't care. And that's why you're both suffering now.

You're obviously going to have to break it to your husband that this is all a direct result of letting dogs run around in the wilderness and get to people's livestock. I'd probably frame it the way I have above: the neighbor didn't seem interested in killing a dog. He seemed more concerned with not having to do it. 

But, if a predator came into your lawn and was a threat to your dogs, you'd defend them. And that's exactly what your neighbor was doing. You both owe him an apology, and if I were you, I'd refuse to get any more animals until you feel comfortable that your husband can handle the responsibility of owning one.

 If you don't trust him to keep your other dog leashed or fenced, I'd suggest going the route of hiring someone to dog sit while you're at work or a doggy day care of sorts. It seems extreme, but I'm not sure your husband would respond to anything less dramatic. He's clearly in denial about all of this.

Good luck to you and I hope you're able to patch things up with your neighbor.

"
"I do that, and she says alright and sort of mellows out but it just happens again a week later or so. It isn't the biggest issue in the world, I know. I might have to assert it better that this isn't what I want to be doing ANY weekday after work, I can manage her weird topics on weekends though. I like to entertain it, just not every darn schoolday"
"Have you gone no contact or is he texting you?  

You’ve done the right thing and bonus learned a hard life lesson, always be ready to talk things through and don’t settle for a non commital answer that skirts around the subject.  

I’m guessing you’ve known this for years but didn’t want to have The Talk because of the time/years you have spent investing in a relationship. Good for you OP taking the plunge after 8 years rather than 16 years when you’re solely responsible for children that he never wanted in the first place."
"Yeah, I mean, a heads-up is nice. I don't think it should be obligatory, though. Like, I switched my thyroid dose a few months ago. Sorry, no guilt over not boring my husband with how many grains I'm taking or what a grain even is."
"Most guys have to work to get laid. Only a small minority of men can just send a quick message and get a hookup. 

One day take a picture of an average guy (and I mean average with a slightly receded hairline and some chub) and make a tinder profile and try to get a hookup. It’s not easy. "
"Oh my stars this is the cutest thing.  Thank you for the update, OP!"
Yeah. That was my first thought too. How does ge react to OP believing her sister? Why does it read like he doesn't think this is a big deal?
"&gt;Two Questions: 1. Was I a rebound? and 2. Is it alright to message her now and let her now how I feel and get some closure? Thank you.

1. Maybe
2. No

This relationship ended MONTHS ago and you've barely communicated at all since then.  You're not going to be able to get any more closure than a picture of her happily dating someone else.  It's over.  "
"Yeah, his reaction is making me think this was malicious.  She does say in a comment that he's said the chairs were ugly before.  I can't help but think these actions were motivated by that mentality?  Certainly if he thought he was doing this for her, his first reaction wouldn't be to get defensive and call her unappreciative after this fiasco."
"If you're not ready, you're not ready, and it's okay if you're never ready. It's shitty of your girlfriend to push you to go to your family for Thanksgiving, but people who don't have terrible families don't understand what terrible families are like at all. Your mom may support you a bit but it doesn't sound like she's standing up against the rest of your family much.

Do your own thing at this point, you're an adult. I would strongly suggest, given your past, that you move to somewhere new."
"Don't skip Thanksgiving.  Especially considering you're supposed to be going to his family's house for Thanksgiving.  Even if you are right (which, I believe you are), it's going to reflect poorly on you not going, and you'll likely be written off as dramatic. 

""I just don’t want to speak to him right now"".  You may not want to, but obviously you need to.  You're both feeling some shit right now, and just not talking to him doesn't solve anything.  If you're allowed to say ""he's a grown man,"" it's just as easy for him (or his family) to say that ""you're a grown woman, and you need to talk through your problems"".  

"
"He IS the bad guy, though, OP.

He is bad FOR YOU. He wants to erase your heritage, and put you hard earned skills in a lockbox, unused, so that HIS idea of what he wants HIS life to be can be realized 

He DOES NOT see you as an equal person with her own goals, needs, and vision for her life.

I'm actually begging you - wake up and look at what he actually is, not who you think he is or who you wish him to be.

Compromise is when two people, working as a team, come up with a life plan that satisfies both.

It is not one person begging to hold on to the scraps of her identity by offering to cut off some of it as a blood sacrifice to someone else's entitled selfishness. "
"Op, I hate to say this, but your dad is not a great parent. You don't have a great set of parents. You have an abuser and an enabler. What your father did while you were growing up was not ok, and what he is doing to you now is not ok. You need to cut contact with him to protect yourself until you can learn how to enforce healthy boundaries. You should try to get into therapy asap."
"'he's agreeable to be around when I don't ask him to actually contribute like an equal partner', usually."
He constantly tells me that I'm the most important thing in his life and that he wants to marry me - I think I just kind of fell for the words when the actions aren't there to back those sentiments up. 
"You're not being unreasonable. They could have chosen a different date, and if your mom so badly wants to do a family Christmas card picture she can schedule that for a day when you're available. "

Bravo!"
"I get her  mindset. My boyfriend wont tell me stuff right away and it  angers me that when good things happen im not the first person he wants to call. Makes you feel unimportant.

Have a talk with her and express you care. Try to be more open with her. I have a feeling this isn't the first time you haven't shared something with her. "
"Probably not. But there's still an expectation. My dad has said things like, ""but it's your sister."" "
"&gt; fear failing and her leaving me for someone else

Well, 99% of teenage relationships fail. "
"Yeah dude, thats being maipulative and petty.

If you have an issue, be a man a talk to her."
"I don't think this is the case at all. It's unrealistic to find this not incriminating - she locked him out, sent a guy something right after she pierced her nipples, and got back ""those are perfect"". That's 100% incriminating. What, do you think she locked him out so she could take a picture of his Christmas presents for this dude?"
"I'd suggest getting yourself into therapy. This sounds like a major self-esteem problem and it's probably the main contributing factor to your lack of success in finding decent partners. Men like the last guy you dated prey on insecurities like yours.

You have to be nice to yourself before you can expect anyone else to be nice to you."

Do you want to stay together if she goes to school 2?"
"It sounds like you want to reach out. Reaching out and acknowledging his grief is not going to say it's okay he cheated. If it doesn't hurt you to send a card, I think it's worth doing.

Yes, he cheated on you and that's awful, but he's still a human being going through loss.

But if it pains you to even touch the subject, just let it be. Don't risk your own emotional health to support him.

As for the sister, again, if it's not too hard for you, you could just send a card. You don't have to engage in a conversation about it. But don't send a card if you honestly don't care. (And it's okay if you don't care.)"

"I met a guy when I was 17, a few weeks before my 18th birthday. He waited until after I turned 18 and finished high school to ask me out. I *thought* he was 22 maaaybe 23. Imagine my surprise when he told me he was 25, turning 26, which he was very nervous about telling me. By that point though I was head over heels

We were in different, but weirdly comparable stages of life. He's not an abusive guy. I was very mature for my age and he was a bit immature. The dating pool where we lived at the time was very small. My mom recognized that he was a good guy and I was an adult, so she held her peace. Now he fits in so well with my family.

We've been together for 10 years. We have a baby and a really wonderful life. Good, healthy communication, no weird power struggles. Healthy respectful and loving. It's the exception, not the rule, but still. Sometimes age really is just a number. Be supportive and keep your eyes open (like see something say something) but they might be okay. If the relationship is going to fall apart you can be there for her. If it goes the distance, people who were disapproving might not enjoy a close relationship with them."

This just sounds like she's looking for stupid reasonings to get her way and you're not playing along, so you must be the party pooper.

"LEAVE HIM. He isn't your friend, his weak and pathetic response in your update shows he won't change and he is a 28 year old child. You say you don't have other friends...you don't have friends, period. And he is holding you back. 

To OP's boyfriend who I am sure will be back to read responses again: you are pathetic and disgusting. Your friends are pathetic and disgusting. It isn't just about not defending her, it is about being a bad partner and an immature idiot. You should feel deeply ashamed and I hope you don't change. Because then she will leave and find someone who is actually deserving of a relationship.

Jesus I'm surprised it took her that long to leave! If she gets married to him they get a bunch of financial benefits from the military. I highly doubt he filled her head with anything. I had a boyfriend in high school that my parents hated and I just continued to date him behind their backs. Then when I was on my own I dated him again. I didn't marry him because he really was terrible but I had to find that out for myself. You sound like you don't actually know your daughter at all.

"If you've both read the book
then you both need to go back to school to upgrade your language skills.

The book specifically says that requests are made, never demanded.

It is about doing something for the other person, recognizing that they have certain preferences that may be different than yours. i.e. you cooking for her means nothing to her... so you can't complain that she doesn't appreciate it. Likewise, you don't care about gifts, so she can't complain that you didn't appreciate the thousands of dollars she has spent.

The author is very clear, and it baffles me that you both missed these points, repeated over and over again in the book?"
"Oh wow. The anti-owning people are really irrational.

"Four months is nothing. It sounds like you are trying to rush this along and it's not helping. There are going to be a lot of ""firsts"" here that will be unbearably painful for her: first Halloween, first Thanksgiving, first Christmas, first Diana birthday, etc. and each will be a fresh wave of grief at her absence. Let her lead the way. Don't press her on things that don't matter like shopping or pancakes. Those traditions hurt now. If she wants to talk about Diana, listen or get someone else to: don't try to avoid the topic because it makes her seem sadder. I'm sure you are all grieving, but this has hit her extra hard because they were so close. You can't expect her to go along as normal with her daughter dead."
"This is the very reason Ive watched younger male lawyers move ahead of me in my firm: I was working so hard to get people to understand. Like the world CANT make sense if they couldnt possibly see how insane they were being in a particular conflict or political situation. 

Once I stopped trying so hard and started living by the truth I knew, things fell into place. More often than not you find that people arent as stupid as you think: they get it...they just want to ignore, whine, manipulate etc. Or they have some sort of emotional block that prevents logic from seeping in.

Either way, it is a WASTE of energy to pander to this nonsense. Live your truth. Be open minded, diplomatic and fair. Accept input and listen to grievances. But ultimately...call the damn shot."

She may think it's going to set a precedent. The baby can't crawl now but eventually she will be able to and she'll be able to walk and break shit and ruin shit that belongs to your wife. 
"Things you should be worried about too:

-Did you have a conversation to make sure you are both on the same page about what you will do if birthcontrol fails and an unintended pregnancy occurs?  Are you both actually able to access the option you would both most likely want (as in you have money and live in an area where your choice, whatever it may be, is accessible to you)?

-Have you both been tested (even if you've never had penetrative sex that doesn't mean you can't have STIs)?  If you have been tested are you actually sure of what you were both tested for (and what you weren't tested for), and whether any other sexual contact that either of you engaged in that could cause an STI would fall into the window before testing occurred where it wouldn't be caught on a test (or after)?

-Have you both had relevant vaccines (such as the HPV vaccine)? 

-Is she on birthcontrol and if she is, what method/ what are the actual risks, concerns, effectiveness, etc.?

-Do you have enough condoms and know how to properly use them? (even if she is on birthcontrol you should still be using condoms).

-Have you tested to see if you can stay hard in a condom?

-Is it worth obtaining emergency contraception (and is that a legal option for you where you live, something she'd be willing to take, etc.) in case you mess up and misuse a condom the first time or incase it breaks?

-Have you two gotten to know each other sexually in other ways or is it the first time you'll be having any contact? (if it is the first time reconsider going for full on sex and instead work on getting to know each other's bodies, how to pleasure each other, etc.). The fact that she has never seen you naked suggests you haven't really been testing the waters so to speak.  Consider holding off until you both get comfortable with each other naked.

-Do you really fully 100% understand what is and is not consent and are you in an area where you can both consent to sex with each other? 

Truth, it may well be awkward and might not go as planned the first time.  Prepare for all the ways it could end terribly as best you can (so protection, communication, etc.) and start by just trying to enjoy each other without a clearly stated end goal of ""we must have this type of sex in this way at this time."""
"My words don't seem to be very effective either. Point blank ""I am really stressed out and nervous about thanksgiving"" and ""I am hurt that you didn't ask me if it was OK to change plans"" didn't work. My words don't seem to click with him unless I am emotional as well. :/ I'm starting to think that maybe we really are not a good match at all. Thanks for your response."
"I'll be honest. From a relationships perspective, if you do not keep this pregnancy, the outlook doesn't look great. That doesn't mean that keeping the pregnancy is the best choice for you, or that your relationship will be fine if you do keep the pregnancy, just that the outlook probably isn't good if you have an abortion. Since you and your partner do both want children (or at least a child), I'll echo the others in that therapy is probably your best option, along with a lot of anti-nausea drugs. Speaking of the drugs, I would make sure you choose an OBGYN who fully understands and respects the severity of your condition. Obviously no pregnant woman loves dealing with the nausea, but this goes far beyond the average person's distaste of vomiting. Some doctors are hesitant to prescribe various anti-nausea drugs for pregnant women due to the risks, but in your case the benefits of some of the riskier drugs may very well outweigh their risks (this is similar to other women who need to take not perfectly pregnancy safe drugs for their mental or physical health during pregnancy).  "
"&gt; Is it such a crime to leave my friends for fifteen minutes

Yes, this is the problem.  If you are out to be with your friends then be with your friends and not the random strangers.  If you want to meet new people then you need to go out without your friends.   It sucks to be left hanging for 15 - 20 minutes at a time."

"Your mother is too old for that crap, she sounds like she's your age honestly. And she's not a feminist, she's an asshole disguised as one because it's trendy and you can go online and hate on others under that excuse.

I find it amazingly ironic your mom made the same type of asshole comment Trump would have made himself. 

Regarding your date, honestly it's up to her if she wants to pursue things with someone whose mother is an idiot with no social awareness. Not your fault of course, but she's entitled to feel uncomfortable with that situation. Talk to her and see how she feels, tell her you don't understand why your mom was behaving like that. If she agrees to pursue things, don't ever take her again to your mom's place."
"&gt;Do you live in a very conservative area/somewhere where women are expected to be stay-at-home moms?

Yes, I live in a major city in the southeast. Women are very much expected to be stay at home moms. Of the working women I do know, 100% of them also do 100% of the childcare and 100% of the chores, on top of working full time, which is the biggest reason I'm so wary of starting something with a person who can't pull his own weight. 

It's been really nice (if confusing) to hear all of these positive responses, I was expecting a ton of people to be like ""how dare you, it's 2017""."

"&gt; To be fair, she majored in Psychology with a side focus on Child Psychology so I understand she does have knowledge on the topic.

I just read this post to my Dad, who is a PhD Child Developmental Psychologist with a 46 year career.  He said, and I quote ""that woman has just destroyed a child's world, destroyed his trust in his parents, and she obviously doesn't know anything about the intricacies of adoption and how to handle it.  I hope she doesn't continue in psychology at all for a career, unless she can realize how monumentally she screwed up.""

So yeah.  Your wife is horrendously in the wrong.  As you said in a comment, your brother and his wife have been navigating this process with a therapist working with their son, and your wife had NO RIGHT no interfere.

Tell your wife that you disagree vehemently.  Tell her you won't run any interference between her and your brother/his wife, and that you expect her to apologize.  Tell her this seriously shakes your trust in her because she just robbed decision-making ability from a parent, and how would she feel if someone did that to her about her own child?"
"With her follow up comment and the fact that there were other opportunities to date you that she didn't take, I read it as she sowed her wild oats when she was younger and now she's looking to settle down. I don't know how you can come back from a comment like that. And do you really want a relationship with someone who you worry settled for you? Like that voice is going to be nagging in the back of your mind now regardless. You haven't been together that long. I'd end it, and wait until I found someone who was Fuck Yes about me."

"&gt; He always joke that the chairs were ugly

This puts everything in context. You need to put this in the OP.

It strongly hints at malicious intent... and if *not* out of the purest malice, your best case scenario is that he did this driven by supreme arrogance and disrespect: fully believing that what he thinks matters more than what you think, and that his opinions are far more valuable than yours *even when it comes to YOUR possessions that YOU own.*"
"The loss wouldn't be tax deductible because the gain was never recognized in the first place. Imagine I find a really rare antique at a yard sale and pay $20 for it. If I now sell it for $100,000 then my profit is $99,980 and I'd have to pay tax on all of that. If it's destroyed before I sell it then I can't deduct the $100,000 because I never paid tax on the $100,000 in the first place."
"That being said, spending a lot of time together on a day-to-day basis is not an argument you should use in this. "
"Here's the heartbreaking thing then: he doesn't care. He doesn't want to care about your effort and your kid. He wants to live like a child and have you take care of him and his family supports this idea. 

If you saw that one of your children were in a marriage like this, I'm SURE you'd want them to get out. I'm a dang stranger and I care about you enough to want you to you to be able to get out. I know it's extreme and scary and it will likely take you months or years to get to the point where YOU are ready (instead of it coming from internet strangers). But this guy not only doesn't care, but when confronted with it, doesn't want to change or get better or love you better. That's a deal breaker. 

The good news is that you're strong as hell and you can do anything. You've got this no matter what you decide to do. "
"well... no, most kids find out on their own, i would imagine, whether through the media, their friends, or otherwise. "
"SO I almost thought my dude wrote this about ME. I've had depression since I was a teenager (im 26) and my adult life brought severe anxiety. Most alarming being disassociating! and slowly over time would disassociate during sex. Sex that I didn't want but had anyway about every week or two to keep the relationship happy. But that's not real happiness obviously. at this time I also dissociated with my identity, not recognizing my own face as ""me"" etc. I absolutely think her intimacy issue is due to her mental health problems. she needs to want to take care of herself for her and the relationship's happiness.

and in case you wondered, now that I'm medicated again and taking care of myself, I like sex (and my dude is fineee)"

"Do you guys live far away? What exactly have you done to see the baby and or help? It sorta sounds like you just want SIL to call and Skype when it's convenient for you, and complain that she's not over the top begging you to be apart of the baby's life. You even admit your mom doesn't want to visit. So what exactly are you expecting here? "
"&gt; no. I'M surprised that HE'S averse to rings like that given his CLEAR appreciation for the role I play in his life

Those two things are completely divorced from each other and the fact that you're conflating them with each other is your problem.   You see the role you play as one you should receive restitution for in some form - this case a ring.  But really, you should be doing - or want to do - those things because that's how a relationship works.  He pays the rent because that sacrifice is worth being with you and you clean and cook because the sacrifice is worth being with him, not because you think you're gonna eventually get something for it. "
"Sorry, his behaviour changed shortly after he got what he wanted out if you. I wish you all the best, but I think you were used. 

Whatever the case, get him out of your life."
"&gt;an unspoken agreement to continue paying his mom's mortgage indefinitely since his father passed. 

And he had a WRITTEN lagally binding agreement to pay rent. HE PUT HIS MOTHER AHEAD OF YOU. When - if ever - do you think he will start to prioritize YOU? Never, is my guess.

However, it came down to only him and another sibling paying and the rest were off scott-free. He felt bad leaving the entire mortgage for the last sibling to pay so he continued living there instead of figuring it out amongst the rest of the siblings.

So this will carry on? he'll go on paying for mummy forever? Even when you marry? His mother is preventing you and his marriage from getting off the ground. This is utter madness.

&gt;it ended up being more like 5 months 

OK so he owes 50% for that period. 

**do not marry a mummys boy - they never change**"
"Yeah, you were right."
She’s showing an incredible interest in only your wallet. Dump her quietly and block her 
"&gt; Our relationship was going so well, literally 3 years now

Sometimes, something happens that can utterly and irrevocably destroy a perfectly fine relationship.

Getting drunk and publicly accusing your partner of having an incestuous affair in front of their family at Thanksgiving is one of those things.

Even if *you* forgive your girlfriend, how will you ever be able to bring her around your family again?"
"Write a book.  Now before you think this is foolish let me finish.  You need to set yourself apart from the rest of the field.  You need to stand out, be perceived as an expert or someone highly skilled.  There is no better way to do so than to publish something about your field of study.  

Pick a topic within your area of study and write a 30 or 40 page ""book"" about it.  It doesn't have to be ground breaking or original, it could be a collection of ideals or processes bundled into an easy to read package.  You are branding yourself.

I did this when I used to work in the finance industry.  I published a 45 page ""book"" on managing money.  It dealt on the basics - how to save, how to budget, insurance basics, how credit and mortgages work, etc.  I was creating a brand.  It would never win any prizes but I suddenly I was the advisor who knew what he was talking about.

Set up a very inexpensive website were a personal URL if possible (one with your name in it).  Put the book, in PDF form, on your site for everyone to see.  Include links on your resume and talk it up with potential employers.  You are branding yourself.  

Again, you are not doing noble prize research.  Just packaging up ideals, processes, methodologies, etc.  None of your peers or competition is doing anything like this.

Good luck.  "
"Your family sound horrible, controlling, interfering and completely toxic. I feel so sorry for your younger sister, she would be much better off without them in her life. So would you. Cut out the crazies. "
"Why would the family all know about the rape? Most victims keep it. Secret for many valid emotional reasons, and OP chose to be discreet about it here "
Now's the time to actually shave your head bald and see what happens with your fiancee.  You want to find out now before you are married whether she's going to reject what for you will be the inevitable.
The first rule of staying in a bad relationship for the sake of your child is DON'T DO THAT because it's actually the worst thing you can do.
"I live with him. I cannot just get up and walk away that easy. We have things together. I had knee surgery, I can’t drive. This situation isn’t just as easy as me getting my stuff together, putting it in my car and leaving. I cannot drive with my current injury. I don’t have friends in this town because of...guess who. It’s very stressful. I don’t know how to move on when I am injured and have very limited mobility. "
"This is definitely not a 'HELL NO GURL BREAK UP RIGHT NOW' post. Guy fucked up by telling her, but from what we can tell, he's a great partner who loves her. Shit happens, life is messy. It's not super nice but it's fine to casually date multiple people until you know who you want to be with. OP, very naturally, has this 'made for each other' thing in the back of her mind, being 'someone's Alyssa', as a lot of us do, but it's not realistic - and believe me I'd be feeling the same thing as her right now. 

OP you need to tell your partner you're upset by this, it was wrong of him to tell you just to alleviate his own guilt - he needs to do a lot of repair work by reiterating how he wants to be with you and how much he loves you - and you might need to do some work on getting the fairytale out of your head. "
"It could be that she wants to photograph the city. New Orleans is a beautiful town and if she lives somewhere like Ohio it would add to her portfolio to have some beautiful pics of our grave yards, the French quarter, live oaks and historical sights.  "
I didn’t say he should invite her.  I’m saying she does not have a family.  Not having a family period to spend holidays with is a completely different situation than having a family and choosing to not see them.  OP is upset over her lack of family and how it leaves her alone over holidays not the actual holiday itself.
"&gt; I do not know why she is fixated on hating me.

Because you are a child, and she knows your relationship is wrong. A 50 year old dating an 18 year old is beyond creepy and gross. Run away."
"The only insight is, if you want this relationship, deal with it.  There is no magic button because you can't change ages. What you listed is what comes with it. "
"Maybe it’s me but I’d get that ring box, and get down on one knee, open it up with a picture of the other man in there. And ask her ‘will you be my x and get the f#&amp;$ out of here’. "
Liking stuff in your butt and loving women are not mutually exclusive.
"Be brave, OP. If there was ever a time in your life to be brave, it is now. 

Please do some reading about the cycle of abuse. 

&gt;[Psychologist] Lenore E. Walker interviewed 1,500 women who had been subject to domestic violence and found that there was a similar pattern of abuse, called the ""cycle of abuse"".

&gt;**1: Tension building**
Stress builds from the pressures of daily life, like conflict over children, marital issues, misunderstandings, or other family conflicts. It also builds as the result of illness, legal or financial problems, unemployment, or catastrophic events, like floods, rape or war.[5] During this period, the abuser feels ignored, threatened, annoyed or wronged. The feeling lasts on average several minutes to hours, it may last as much as several months.[6]

Your boyfriend lost his job and he's frustrated and emotional.

&gt;**2: Acute violence**
Characterized by outbursts of violent, abusive incidents which may be preceded by verbal abuse[5] and include psychological abuse.[6] During this stage the abuser attempts to dominate his/her partner (survivor) with the use of domestic violence.

The coerced sex, the slap to the face *during* sex... I mean, your title even tries to downplay with by saying he ""kind of slapped"" you, but, he pretty much slapped you, full stop.

&gt;**3: Reconciliation/honeymoon**
The perpetrator may begin to feel remorse, guilty feelings, or fear that their partner will leave or call the police. The victim feels pain, fear, humiliation, disrespect, confusion, and may mistakenly feel responsible.[5]

&gt;Characterized by affection, apology, or, alternatively, ignoring the incident, this phase marks an apparent end of violence, with assurances that it will never happen again, or that the abuser will do his or her best to change. During this stage the abuser may feel or claim to feel overwhelming remorse and sadness. Some abusers walk away from the situation with little comment, but most will eventually shower the survivor with love and affection. The abuser may use self-harm or threats of suicide to gain sympathy and/or prevent the survivor from leaving the relationship. Abusers are frequently so convincing, and survivors so eager for the relationship to improve, that survivors (who are often worn down and confused by longstanding abuse) stay in the relationship.

Yeah, sound familiar? He cuddled you all night... he cried and begged forgiveness... he called himself the worst kind of human being... he promises to change....

&gt;**4: Calm**
During this phase (which is often considered an element of the honeymoon/reconciliation phase), the relationship is relatively calm and peaceable. During this period the abuser may agree to engage in counseling, ask for forgiveness, and create a normal atmosphere. In intimate partner relationships, the perpetrator may buy presents or the couple may engage in passionate sex.[5] Over time, the batterer's apologies and requests for forgiveness become less sincere and are generally stated to prevent separation or intervention.[6] **However, interpersonal difficulties will inevitably arise, leading again to the tension building phase.**[5] The effect of the continual cycle may include loss of love, contempt, distress, and/or physical disability. Intimate partners may separate, divorce or, at the extreme, someone may be killed.

Life is stressful. Life events like sickness, money troubles, house or work problems, or unemployment happen. You now know that when the going gets rough, he will resort to violence -- and not even violence, but sexual violence, to make himself feel better. 

Most abusers are not psychopaths. Just like most domestic abuse victims are not pathetic women with no resources. "
"I would say that the fact that she doesn't want his mom to know is a really bad sign.  If this were an immature woman having what she thought was an adult relationship with a younger man, it wouldn't need to be secret.  She knows it is wrong.  "
"I'm sorry that your ex-friend is a terrible person.  Especially when you did so much to help her.

Your friendship with her is over, and you *should* just ignore her and move on, but it'll be hard to grieve a long-time friendship.  Part of me wants you to talk to other bridesmaids and find out if they actually feel like Sarah, or if she was just throwing them under the bus.

And if people ask why you aren't involved in the wedding anymore, be truthful.  Sarah will tell lies about your absence because the truth is too ridiculous to be believed."
"I'm very well off but I don't have complete access to my money so I can also ""max out"" my funds until I can get more. It sounds like her family is wealthy, which means she probably doesn't have access to all the wealth that can support her. "
"Why is nobody pointing out she lied from the get-go about going home after work? I can't imagine her going home to take care of dogs and *not* changing out of her work clothes to go out

This whole thing is premeditated cheating from square one!"
"Same.  If I'm giggling it was great.  If I'm laughing gleefully, it was amazing.   "
"Yea I'm glad I got away from him, but not before I married him, he isolated me from all of my friends, tried to drown me in our bath tub and tampered with my birth control so I got pregnant, thinking if we had a kid I would never leave. The night I finally left I had to call my mom to come and get me, she explained that her and my father couldn't watch me go through it any more and they wouldn't continue to support my marriage and that I needed to have him arrested, which I did and immediately moved back in with my parents. 3 weeks later I missed my period and was trying to convince myself it was just from the stress of everything I was dealing with... a week later I took a pregnancy test and sure enough... positive. He went through anger management and therapy and I got back with him a month before I was due. The labor and deliveye was traumatic, I needed comfort and support and he sure as shit wasn't giving it and wouldn't let my mom come in the room. When I was being rolled into the delivery room he was next to me but ran before I even got there. I have birth to my daughter  completely alone. I'm crying just typing this up. We only lasted a month after that because I finally realized this was not the life I wanted for me and my child. Best choice I could have made.

My point is, this is just the tip of the iceberg, things can and will get worse. I am lucky that when I met my now husband my ex disappeared from our lives. She is 10 now and mu husbanf has be daddy since day 1 9 years ago. I am now living a life that I deserve, which took years of therapy to come to terms with. I am worthy of the love I have found. 

You are worth more and you deserve better. I hope you get out of this and find someone who is worthy of you. I have many more stories of what I went through and what I went through with my mental health. Please PM me if you want to talk, or need resources or just someone to be there for you. "
"&gt;  you are absolutely shooting yourself in the foot

Oh lord, yes. Seriously, with every comment I'm understand better why they aren't invited. "
"It’s not flaky or unreliable, but it’s unlikely the rest of the family knows that OP is given so little notice for these things. So it probably comes across as flaky to them."
"&gt;The therapist dug deeper into our emotions and we discovered the root of the problem. I was being uncommunicative and made her feel neglected.

There's only two scenarios here. You either:

A) Have a shitty therapist or

B) Let her manipulate your therapists words into blaming yourself

I'm just gonna be blunt here since you're unwilling to take advice anyways and tell you that your girlfriend is trash for manipulating you this deeply. 

The good news is that even if you did dodge this bullet, you're so incredibly gullible and naive that you'd only be shot by another one later anyways."
"&gt; he has to be able to make the choice whether that is acceptable to him.

No, some dude who's not even willing to wear a condom and makes her shoulder 100 percent of the responsibility for birth control absolutely does not get to make a choice whether it's ""acceptable"" to him.

"
"Learning lesson for you. If you had the money in your bank account you needed to pay for it and recognize you have to cut back elsewhere. That's just a life lesson.

PS: Standard tip is 20%, not 15%. I know you didn't have a ton of money but if you go out to eat you need to factor in the tip. 

PPS: Because a standard tip is 20%, serving is a nice gig since you're looking for a job."
"I'd add to this: go back once only, with a friend or relative, to get your things. Stay at a hotel if you must. Your safety is the utmost of importance. He may have been stewing in anger all week. Don't face him alone."
"I'm actually disgusted in you as a person. Not only did you betray him to his abusers - but you ARE an abuser.

I seriously want to give your soon-to-be ex husband a hug. He does NOT deserve any of this. 

I don't think any other comments or feedback will have any impact on you whatsoever. You've shown no accountability in this situation, and none of this seems to be getting through to you."
"And the fact that OP has to compromise 100% to Brazilian customs, but her husband isn't willing to accept customs or other aspects of her culture. It's very unfair and doesn't make for a healthy relationship when only one person wields all of the control and power. "
"Could you sit together and text?  And maybe you could still speak, but give her the time to get her words down?  You might still get the emotional connection that you want out of a face to face conversation, but also allow her to communicate as she does best."
"People can reveal a lot about how they see the world when they tell you about hiw they think others see the world. He thinks you would lie and try to trick him into paying more than his share, because that's what he thinks everyone does because that's what he does.

Most people don't assume others tricks people into paying for them. But also most people don't expect people to pay for their expenses without discussing it first, argue for the more expensive option when someone else is paying, or pretend like nothing is wrong when even the waiter is reacting to something being wrong. There's an obvious connection between his assumption of your behaviour and his own behaviour: tricking others into paying for you. This is how he thinks people behave.

He might honestly not realise it's unattractive or weird, because he seems to genuinly think that such lies and deceit is normal and everyone does it. To get to his point in life still not realising how immoral and weird it is must take a lot of self delusiok and denial."
"You must not know many people, because I've seen incredibly nice people make horrendous judgement calls. Many times. We're all human, we all make mistakes, and yeah, sometimes those mistakes are really big and really stupid and easily avoidable."
"One reason people always bring this up is because someone not aware of the law on this might just assume it was OK  to just change the locks and throw all their ex's stuff out in the street or something, which is absolutely illegal and could likely get the cops called. So while you're right that it won't be necessary to actually go through the process most of the time, it's important to know that the tenant does have protections and you can't just do whatever you want. "
"You are in a negotiation. They are no longer your parents in this scenario.

You are not trapped.

Point out exactly what will happen if you leave. Show your worth. Negotiate for a more ownership stake in the business. Get a better share of the profits. Especially if you leaving would essentially tank the business.

And be ready to walk. That's the biggest thing. They are doing what they're doing because they can. As long as they feel you won't leave, they will maintain the status quo. Because the status quo favors them."
"I was linked here from a Foucault Dank Meme facebook group so I will try to make this as little of a shitpost as possible.

First of all Foucault is right about a lot of things but is also wrong about a lot of stuff. Honestly applying a lot of his philosophy in a parent child situation seems a bit silly, especially because biopower is something that sort of just exists and cant really be resisted by shutting a door to your bedroom while you are making out. As far as discussions go either A) ignore him or B) troll him insesintely by arguing the complete opposite of whatever he says, in this case I would recommend arguing that Hobbes (an english philosopher who believes authority is absolute IE you should always obey the government and your parents no matter what) is true.

Also when you say a book about how capitalism makes you crazy are you referring to Capitalsim and Schizophrenia by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, because if so get ready for commentary that is a 100 times more weird  and anti authority than focault

"Huh your dad sounds like mine used to be. Constantly loan sharking and then fishing for thanks and praise for things he gave me that I didn't want, and getting offended if I tried to refuse. 

It ended when on one of his 'I said jump and you didn't ask how high' tantrums I just went ""Sorry you feel that way but no."" Every time he escalated to make me back down on my decision by demanding gifts he'd previously given back and disowning me I just went ""OK then"" and started discussing the arrangements to give things back like I didn't care. He hung up in a rage and we didn't talk for a bit. 

Once he got the message that silent treatment would never work and I was prepared to move ahead with my life with or without contact with him, and that I would be very open with friends and family on why we were no contact if asked, things changed for the better. Maybe he didn't want to lose face, but setting that boundary did improve our relationship, he hasn't done the loan sharking since. 

If you do take this route, whether you end up no contact or not, I just want to let you know the sense of freedom from no longer having things held over your head is so worth it.

"I agree with you until the last sentence. They've decided not to buy it for him and that's that. They don't have to back down, and especially in light of this new situation I don't think they should."

"I'm pretty sure you guys are doing it backward. Why your love languages are things that come naturally to do so you're more apt to do them (acts of service, gifts etc) learning each other's love languages is about how to make the OTHER feel loved. So since your LL is acts of service, if she wants to make you feel loved she does something for you instead of buying you a gift because this is YOUR love language. If you want to make her feel loved you buy her something instead of doing a task for her because gifts are her LL. 

Learning Love languages helps us understand how we give and receive love, but learning them as a couple is focused more on how to make sure you are showing love in the language of your partner. 

Does that make sense? So almost the opposite of how you've been doing them!

Also your GF sounds like a crappy gf love languages aside."
"Well that just seems a silly reason to judge someone, given that it's a perfectly legitimate spelling."
Are the offshore accounts legal? 
"So despite BOTH climaxing she is obligated to have multiple rounds of sex that wouldn't be enjoyable for her? No. They had sex, they BOTH got off and he decided later that he wanted more. Even if she originally woke him up for sex that ""obligation"" you seem to think she had was fulfilled when he had an orgasm. I'm at a loss here about why this is even in question. "
Because it's another financial stress for me? Isn't it obvious...
"Very bizarre. Who is on the invite - him +1? or he and you specifically? This is totally inappropriate and reads like he doesn't want you at the wedding, but now this chick he likes wants to go to New Orleans with him he will bring you along so spending time with her looks less weird. How old are you and how long is the relationship? 

This is super inappropriate and yes, this wedding should be romantic couple time, not random 3rd wheel time."
"Right, because if the abuser was always abusive then there would be no relationship. They're not stupid. They know how to dole it out slowly at first, with lots of plausible deniability. Then they eventually break you down and you're a shell of your former self who doesn't know up from down. Don't let that happen to you. "

"You realize that your edit makes you behavior in this even more atrocious, correct? This isn’t about your failure at suredly shutting down your subordinate’s attempts to seduce you. This is you feeding a crush on your subordinate, leading her on that you wanted to step out on your wife with her, flirting with her, and then only giving a soft no once she calls you out to pay up. 

Then you have the audacity to throw your wife under the bus, blaming her “insecurities” as unfounded because you “fixed” it! 

You have been and shown yourself to be a shitty manager, a shitty friend, as well as a shitty husband/father. You tempted fate and then blamed your wife for your shortcomings. 

Don’t you dare spend one more minute wishing your wife would just trust you when you have been nothing but untrustworthy in regard to this woman.

"He cooks dinner for you every night and does all your laundry in exchange for looking after the dog? I'm guessing not.

"Whoah, do NOT take this to your grandma unless she's the very last person in your life you have to turn to. Chances are she's going to side with her husband and this will ruin the relationship you have with her and probably not help the situation at hand. 

Is there someone else you can talk to? A counselor at work or other trusted adult you're not related to? Often times you have to take something like this outside of the family in order to get real help that isn't influenced by family ties. "
"This is absolutely what's happening. Husband doesn't want to face the fact that his mistake killed your dog (really sorry for your loss) and he would rather die on this revenge hill than admit he's the only one to blame here. 

Without knowing your husband it's hard to recommend the best course of action, but perhaps coming at him with compassion might disarm him and get him to open up about what he's *really* feeling. Tell him you understand the desire to do something but it's not going to bring your dog back. However you can still comfort each other over the loss and mourn together. "
"Yet, although it was difficult and impractical, *they wanted you there enough to ask you anyway.*. They thought your company was worth the extra effort.

"My first reaction to both you and OP, is that you're side chicks."
"Keep in mind that before her you spent the majority of your life as a child.

You don't really get to make your own choices during the first 18 years of life.

Then early adulthood is spent low income or as a student with no income.

Hopefully now you are old enough to both hold a job and handle finances to avoid stress and mishap.

You have more agency these days to choose how you want your life to be. "

You do what is best for you and your family! Consider the PT position to keep contact with your employer for when you want to go back to work. 
"No, this is not normal. You need to have a conversation with your partner about the lack of sex and dates. My husband and I make a point to have date night out of the house at least once every 2 - 3 weeks. 

If you're not getting what you need from this relationship, you need to talk about it, thoroughly, before you get married.

&gt; It has honestly been going down hill for probably the last year but hes always had hangups about sex so I just brushed it off and learned to self love more than usual. We have sex maybe... once every 3-6 months. And now its starting to bother me. 

You may also need to consider the possibility that you're sexually incompatible."
"She doesn't seem to know very much about infants. What is she expecting to happen via Skype? A song and dance? The baby eats, sleeps and poops. "
"So...let me get this straight: you’re not good enough to meet his friends, but he wants to maintain contact to be FWB’s?

You not only get to be his masturbation tool, but also his dirty little secret? (I’m choosing my words deliberately, so you can see just how outrageous his texts are.)

Classy women respect themselves and don’t waste time on trash like this. Be thankful that he showed you who he was early on. Ghost him. He doesn’t deserve a response."
"And unfortunately, if you go through with a marriage in 3 months, you WILL learn the hard way. There are already a bunch of cultural differences you have yet to explore. Like, you made no mention of whether he gave you gifts or properly proposed, which are common in Arab/North African culture. so if not, he's bamboozling you."
"You're right, I have to get over my anxiety and talk to him so he can decide how he wants to handle it."
"""I have told you *many* times I am not interested in dating you. If you can't respect my relationship with my boyfriend, we shouldn't stay in contact.""

He is not your friend, he's just waiting to get in your pants."
"As a woman, if I were his daughter and heard that he had said that about me, I would feel threatened. But otherwise, I completely agree with what you have said."
"Tell him how much her comment bothered you when you're both sober. This was not a great thing to bring up when he was drunk. I don't think you should tell him what to do about it, but do let him know that you're hurt and that him dismissing it hurt you more. "

Secondly, sad to say but it's either a drug, prostitute or gambling habbit.

Lastly, even if it is something innocent, you are his wife. There should be absolutely no reason he hides something from you. Or gets mad or mentally abusing when asked about it.
I'd recommend removing yourself from the situation but not before you sit down and actually talk to him about it making sure to tell him that whether he yells or not, this conversation will be happening.
Good luck."
"&gt; he doesn’t feel very welcome -at what should be considered his other home. 

yeah, op is not grasping this part. that's his mothers home so it is his other home. 

he's not a guest in op's apartment, he's staying with his mother at her home and they are an extension of one another. this poor kid has no choice where he lives and i bet it's been very difficult for him having to live with op too."
"Just to add on:

Check your local laws, but if he literally refuses to leave within a month (or whatever the legal minimum and/or your preference is), you can send him an eviction notice.

Also, unless you guys had an agreement that you'd be paying him back, don't support him financially.  Everyone makes decisions in relationships and hopes for the best, you don't get to be vindictive when you know relationships don't work out sometimes.  Don't harbor emotional guilt over it."
Was it because you didn't cry while posting?
"jesus she's really gotten herself into a serious mess. All you can do is say ""look I strongly advise you to leave this terrible terrible situation. Just leave it behind, you can come stay with me for a period."" and support her if she decides to leave. She's an adult who can make her own decisions so that's all you can do."
You should drop her and move on. She is crazy and you did nothing wrong. She's saying you're in the wrong because you didn't text her as soon as you got home? That is super controlling and you are better off without her. 
"Why is Matt so resistent to visit his mom? What's he doing for 3 days that it's necessary for him to be in the apartment? And why can't be considerate to his FIL? 

Yes, it's annoying, but why is he not looking for a compromise in some way? "
"You're not overreacting. He is being a bad partner to you. This would be a completely serious reason to break up with him. What if you get injured again, will you be able to trust him to help you in emergencies? Or will you always be worried he will abandon you? Take some time to think it over and decide if you want to stay with him or not. 

Side note: OP, you made some mistakes here and you have endangered your own health. You may not always have a boyfriend to drive you to the emergency room. You and you alone are in charge of your health. You must obey your doctors. You must fight your eating disorder with every tool you have (medical doctors and talk therapy combined). Since you are prone to injury you should always keep a backup phone battery or charger, and have enough cash on hand for a taxi in case you get injured. Your life literally depends on these things.

Also, your recovery is affecting all your relationships including with your boyfriend. Even the most angelic, saintly boyfriend would probably nope out at this point because you are a danger to yourself and it's hard to watch someone hurt themselves repeatedly with no end in sight. He shouldn't have kicked you out of the car, he's a terrible person for doing that. Instead, he should have broken up with you, if he's too angry and hurt at you to truly be a partner to you. 

Good luck OP, I hope you beat your eating disorder and become strong and healthy again. Probably without this boyfriend since he seems capable of treating you badly and you don't deserve that. Perhaps stay single for a while so you can become healthy and independent on your own. I hope someday you find a new boyfriend who will be by your side during the good times and the bad. "
"""Did you want to make it a double date?  If you want to bring your girlfriend, my boyfriend would love to go to a wine tasting day!  We both enjoy those kinds of things.""

Kind of a gentler let down?"
Thats what I thought! She had to have done this with malice.
"&gt; He did a freelance job and found a new employer within that time frame. Seems impressive really.

Seriously. It doesn't seem like they're in the US, but for any major city area here that would be insanely fast. Like, holy shit good for him. 
"
The fact that these people are not part of the wedding and she is hiding it from her fiance are really big red flags. This is just going to end up badly and personally I think it is best to just stay out of it completely. 
It sounds like your boyfriend wanted to give you a beautiful surprise and thought you'd want to see him on your anniversary. Obviously he probably should have insured it more but it is also a fairly typical expectation. It seems with how put quotes around anniversary and didn't even think of seeing if it was ok to go out with your friend that the relationship isn't critical to you and I imagine he feels that. Personally I feel for your boyfriend because he tried to give you a romantic surprise and you kind of treated it like something not important and didn't seem very sorry for it.
"Seriously!

OP leave Kara the fuck alone! She doesn't want to hear from you and doesn't need people like you and that cow of roommate you call a friend on her life. 

The only advice I have is to learn from this, but from the sound of your post you haven't learned anything and are more concerned about your stupid living situation problem than the trauma caused to what sounds like an incredibly sweet and vulnerable girl. 

Grow up. "
"You make an excellent point. My relationship with my mom suffered severely as well, specifically because she defended and refused to divorce him. I was around 11 when I told my parents to get a divorce, btw. Kids want their parents to be happy, and to be engaged as parents. 

Luckily for mom, I was willing to mend some fences as I got older."
"Texting really isn't diminishing the importance of a conversation - see it as a way for your wife to feel free to communicate with you confidently. There are days I have trouble walking and just can't make it down the stairs to talk to my SO while he's working, so we've had plenty of long text conversations while we're both in the same house.

 It also has the added benefit of never having any arguments over who said what - it's literally the clearest form of communication...you can look back and see exactly what was said. Sure, it doesn't convey tone due to the lack of verbal and facial cues, but in my experience you tend to get a feel for how your partner texts and will begin to understand their intended tone."
"She says she lives in Ontario, Canada. The first amendment does not apply in this situation. We have pretty good labour laws here though so I imagine this would not be allowed. "
"Nope. In fact just a week ago he was saying those pranks/protests where people pay fines in small coins are wrong because it causes hassle to staff who likely didn’t have anything to do with whatever the cost/charge was. 

If he was genuinely remorseful about it I would feel different. I could see him admitting he fell into peer pressure and wouldn’t do it again, would try to give back to the service by paying the fine or volunteering. At least he’d have learned from it? With small mistakes/rude stuff he has done he usually realises within a few hours and is remorseful. 

But it’s been over 24 hours and before work I could hear him on the computer, talking to friends through discord laughing about how I was still upset.  For whatever reason he does not care about what he has done. Isn’t even remorseful for scratching my face when he physically went for the phone. "
"&gt;  Is it just an xbox or something and you are calling it an 'investment' to make it sound better?

This, totally."
"So, yea... this is exactly where the issue is, you are showing exactly the behaviour that people dislike in person, here in this thread.

I would suggest that you and your wife see a counselor, together, and work on this as a couple. You can support each other through it, and work on things together. "
"Can you guys maybe decide on a safety word, like ""banana""?(sorry Family Guy) Then, if that is said then you BOTH understand that playtime is over."
"Okay, in this case he needs to live with a bit of discomfort. 

The wolf that wins is the wolf you feed, and it's absolutely not good for him if you allow him to feed his controlling, paranoid side by giving in to these demands.

Even the bizarre 10 minute return his call rule would seriously put a dent in you having perfectly innocent fun, girl talk etc by making you closely monitor your phone. With these expectations he's setting you both up to fail.

I would actually say to him that it's okay to have these feelings but it's not okay to act on them by trying to unhealthily control you. Instead he needs to seek some sort of therapy to deal with them, because they're not rational and they're going to hurt the relationship."
Makes me wonder if she told the kids to keep quiet about that visit and not to tell Dad who they were with. Shady.
"This. I came here to be sure this was said. 



And when I became a parent I realized it was not the sex I was worried about (I want my children to be fully functioning adults) it was that I knew eventually their hearts would be broken (because we ALL go through this). Was it awkward? Yes. Was it scary? Hell yes! Was the most important thing to keep the lines of communication open? Hell HELL YES. "
He had a job! He quit after 1 week! 
"This is going to go one of two ways.

The stock discrepancies get pinned onto that one co-worker (when from the comments you've received I'm guessing they're not the only one doing it) and they get fired for it.

or, it's a ongoing thing from the top down and the manager just needed a name to blame and you provided it.

Either of those options will only temporarily affect you right up until the point where you find another job and leave, because that's not a great environment to be working in.

I have to do a weekly stock count. We have to explain any variances beyond the acceptable. I mean, diet coke up, coke down? I guess someone changed their mind after paying so it just got swapped and not refunded, re-sold and that's ok as long as they kind of balance each other.

If we keep having discrepancies that are unexplained we get audited. If we get to that stage we're fucked and talking about written warnings etc.

The other people in this thread saying it's ok, your colleagues were just taking low value stuff? That's how a good manager loses their job, because they are the person responsible for their companies products and if stuff gets stolen it's their problem."
"My family did the same thing when I got on a bus and moved to Texas. I was young and had lived in the midwest my whole life and wanted a change. They mocked me relentlessly, told me it was a stupid and irresponsible idea. When I moved back a year later I got ""ah so now you come back with your tail between your legs,  huh"". Honestly I think they were envious of the fact they gave up their lives to raise me, and as soon as I became an adult I used my newfound freedom and did what they couldn't. I feel bad for OP, it's a really shitty feeling. "
"I'm uncomfortable with the idea of you withholding her passport/greencard. That sounds like the sort of thing an abusive person would do; even if she volunteered I'd decline.

But to be frank, if you don't trust her, I'd decline anyway. You haven't been married that long; it doesn't sound like you were originally a love match anyway. I'm not saying you couldn't make it work, but outside that traditional, conservative culture, she's going to be tempted over and over again to repeat the same behavior, and whatever her issues are, they don't sound resolved. My guess is you're right; she's found she liked the grass better on your side of the fence than on her parents.

I wouldn't take her back, but if you're going to, you need to figure out exactly what drove her to do what she did; not the excuses she might give because she'll tell you anything to get you to let her come back, but the real reasons she'd decide to not come back from visiting her family, and why she said those things. Because if you don't correct them, eventually she'll feel the same way. You will also need to figure out a way to restore that trust she destroyed."
"Uh....you've got more pressung issues than the condom, though the lying is troubling, especially if an unwanted pregnancy is at stake. His reaction is the most troubling--does he always react aggressively and over-the-top like that? Very concerning.

By the way, have you considered a tubal or better, more reliable form of contraception?"
It sucks that the USA won't approve more non-hormonal IUDs. There are really cool metal ones available in Europe and other parts of the world that don't cause the crazy periods like the Paragard can. I got lucky and got a Gynefix Mini installed. It's like the paragard but much smaller and doesn't cause pain. Any woman going to europe on vacation should definitely look into medical tourism for IUDs.
"&gt; I still don't want to see her cry.

and yet she is happy to make you so stressed that you'd consider MOVING HOUSE just to avoid her?

Let her cry. It'll do her good. "
"The bride SHOULD tell the groom about this whole big thing, she needs emotional support from her soon-to-be husband. It's understandable if husband told his family about the wedding drama too, because his family is super-involved in the wedding. It's not to expand on drama, it's to get some support from the people you rely on in a hard time.

They reacted so strongly because this is a pretty big deal. Older sister is trying to blow up the wedding, turning the bride's own mother against her, and cursing her out going so far as to say she's got nothing going for her and the marriage is going to end in divorce. I mean, wouldn't YOU be angry?

I didn't read the original post as fiance+family pulling rank, but as they're arranging 90% of the things at the wedding they absolutely have standing to say ""this is fucked, and we don't want her there."" There were no threats to withdraw funding."
"She already has done this multiple times, I agree that's a completely reasonable compromise. I'll ask my fiance to check over/revise important emails that I don't want coming off weirdly, but I don't make him do the first draft."
"And not only does he sit idly, he enjoys it. He's really not that different from his wife. When people are disrespected, it's ""funny"" to him. What a joke. "
He wants her to break up with him and doesn't have the balls to do it himself
"&gt; I just feel like an extreme asshole if I were to break up with her over that

Not an extreme asshole, an immature asshole."
What is Haley passionate about? Do you try to become interested in her hobbies? 
"Damn,  i usually don't advocate the nuclear option like this sub is so fond of... But does he have any respect for you at all? "
"She's broke while spending *your* money? 

She's taking advantage of you. Pack her bags and send her to Dumpsville. "
"Yep, I don't understand why he continues to praise her and is shocked that his wife is pissed. Sure, Nicole might be stunning and an efficient worker, but she's not a wonderful person if she's trying to screw a married dude. "
"&gt; Their relationship seems healthy 

Then I think you have to pick your battles, and this isn't one you should pick. 

She's with a guy who appears to treat her well, and your only complaint about him is his age, so I think you have to let this one go. "
You are so off the mark about emotional manipulation.  So essentially when my friends ask me about my weekend and I say “oh I had migraines for 3 days” you see my honesty as emotional manipulation because I just didn’t have a good weekend?  I’m not trying to elicit sympathy or any sort of reaction.  I shouldn’t have to lie to people about who I am just so they don’t feel uncomfortable.  It’s up to them to choose how to react to what I say.  Most adults just say ugh that sucks or something and we get right back to some other topic.
"The bf is using him cheating as an excuse to ""rule"" the relationship.  They either need to work it out through counceling or end it."
"Yeah, you don't get to say you want to forgive someone and move on / otherwise remain in a relationship with them AND continue to use the prior indiscretion against them without an extremely good reason.

Either you forgive them, or you don't. If you or they don't, stop torturing them and yourself and get the fuck out, it's that simple."
"OMG you're right! Just the thought of being married to him... argh no way.

 I'm so, *so* lucky this happened. I reckon it would have taken me a fair deal long to break it off with him without a flag as huge as this one landing in front of me. He was doing a few other things I didn't like, but I was letting him get away with it (cancelling dates for 24-hour bugs, forgetting to get back to me about dates, never calling, no longer bothering to take me out for dinner, no daytime dates etc....) 

Thanks for the good luck!!"
"&gt; if you seek someone with a 16 year old or older child it’ll be less pressure and if he has custody soon they’ll be out of the house.

If a guy had a kid at 18-22 years of age, that means you should be looking for men no younger than 34-38 years of age (assuming their kid is 16 years old). You might want to go up in age rather than down (those guys are likely looking to have kids for the first time)."
"This guy deceived you, which is gross. Now you consider him an embarrassment, which just adds more grossness. This manipulative liar doesn't deserve any sympathy, yet I couldn't help but feel bad for him when you shared your fantasies about how the wedding guests would laugh. Please end it and spare both of you."
"An immature, impulsive person who is already being irrational about wanting a baby, and:

* clearly does not value the being of his partner (thinks she should have a baby age 19), and

* has already shown he is terrible at predicting outcomes (teen mom and dad who live with their parents will totally be able to take care of a child), and

* appears to want a baby because everyone else has one, and

* when his partner doesn't want a baby he tries to gaslight her into having one anyway by calling her immature for not wanting one.

* Gets nasty when balked (she's the immature one here?) and attempts emotional manipulation by making veiled threats about ending the relationship if he doesn't get what he wants (patience running out).

But you think it's weird to warn OP? 

This guy is like ground zero for reproductive coercion. He's showing all the signs - Puts own ego over partner's well being. Wants something stupid and then turns it around to make their partner the bad one for not liking it. Ignores reality in favor of how they want things to happen. 

The reason people are warning OP to guard her BC is because it is exactly this kind of person who does shit like poke holes in condoms while telling himself that it's OK to do that because he knows better than she does and anyway once she's pregnant she'll see how it's actually a good idea after all.

Maybe he won't do that. Hopefully he won't do that. But if he does - best OP be on guard instead of pregnant when she doesn't want to be. "
"Next time, please don't let guys get away with small things.

Some of them will use the small things to test you, and see how much shit you will take from them.

And if they decide not to continue the relationship because you didn't let them get away with small shit, then you're a winner because you didn't waste any more time on them.

Stop being a doormat, basically. The small things are just a warning that bigger shit is to come. "
"It's sad that you think being on good terms with your daughter is more important than James' mental, sexual and emotional health and development. 

James is a *child*. Your daughter is a *predator*. Are you really saying you condone her behaviour just for the sake of keeping up appearances? I know this is the standard for religious people but *come on*."
"Why the fuck are you giving you ex an out for this? It’s bullshit that he saw through it the whole time. He didn’t until he got dumped by your friend, then he put the pieces together and tried to use them to cover his ass. Too bad there’s tons of cracks and I can still see it. He cheated on you. What they did was cheating. He’s a scumbag trying to lessen his responsibility in your eyes. In my view, boyfriend of multiple years gets 75% blame, your shitty shit friends get the other 25%. Guess what? You need to cut all of them out of your life because they’re disgusting and toxic."
"Very poor boundaries on your part and you even admitted that you liked the attention.  This co-worker is very bad news and you should have ran like your pants were on fire instead of allowing her to heat you up.   You screwed up dude, big time.  This woman is not your friend and she sure is hell not a friend of your marriage and your wife has every right to be super pissed off.   You need to take a long hard look in the mirror and understand your need for attention compromised your integrity and damaged the trust your wife had for you.  Address whatever it is within yourself that caused you to cross this line.  If you don't, you will be one of those men who has an affair and destroys your family and your reputation.  Time to dig deep!   "
"Well it *is* fair if you actually do it too, isn't it?"
"Best case: I was a moron when I was younger and couldn't find a good guy even if he wore a sign with 2' tall lettering that said ""I'm a good guy!""

Worst case: I sowed my wild oats and had my fun, and I'm now ready for a responsible relationship.

Based on her reaction of:

&gt; she says that I am being offended for no reason that ""guys do it all the time."" That guys go around dating the ""hot sl*ts when they are younger, and look for wifey material when they are older.""

it sounds like she's closer to ""worst case"" than ""best case"".  Is it insulting?  Yeah, a little bit.  But I've been a boring responsible person for most of my life, so I've always known who I am &amp; what I want from an SO.  Most people haven't been that way most of their lives.  Whether that's a deal breaker for you, I don't know."
Or not letting it affect the part of her life that revolves around being there for him.
It almost warmed my heart too.
"Sitting him down without prompting from him and teaching him things he should've taken care to learn himself is indeed coddling. If he can learn at work, he can learn this without her doing all the fucking work."

Why you dating someone who treats you like shit?
Be careful on sound recordings. Ask the attorney about that. It could be illegal to do in your state without someone's knowledge.
"I saw a program about a family that was under investigation by child services.  Their 4? year old son wasn't talking at all, not even making ga ga noises.  The mother dismissed it, saying both she and the father had been late talkers.  But they had a clip of the dad having supervised visitation, and he just sat there on his laptop while the boy played.  There was no interaction at all.  The dad thought the visitation had gone well, and you could see the social workers going ""......Right.  That's not going to work""  The family eventually agreed to give him up for adoption.  They weren't malicious at all, just incompetent.  Just competent enough to know they couldn't do it, hence the adoption.  
Like Jack said, children learn language from being talked to, not at, and it being safe to talk back.  And that happens really early.  If she learnt early on that talking was more trouble than it was worth, her brain's language centres never formed fully.  And they never will.

It's not her job to push/force him to grow up. That suffocates relationships
"YOU DIDN’T ASK TO BE BORN. Your parents made the decision to have you, and in doing so, accepted the responsibility of childcare. This does not mean that you “owe them” for feeding and clothing you throughout your childhood. It is literally required of them. Don’t go through life thinking you have to “pay them back” for raising you, or that you have to put up with their abuse because of it."
"Talking to a counselor might help.  Being someone else's caregiver is mentally and emotionally draining, and you would probably be facing some depression even if you had supported her decision to do this.  She will eventually recover and you won't have to endure this forever, but in the meantime you need to take care of yourself too."
"If this is how she reacts over $10, I have no idea how it's possible for you to have seen anything in her to make you think ""This is the woman I'm going to marry and spend the rest of my life with"""
"We're not in the sixties, and even if we were, you're not a housewife.  If your idea of me-time is being alone, pregnant and with a child to look after to clean the house while your loser husband is off for a fun weekend with the boys, there's something very wrong with your marriage. "
"College prestige discrepancy? What college you went to means a lot less then you think once you graduate. The only actual potential issue is if she is a lot dumber then you. In that case you may end up having different interests and difficulties having conversations that engage both of you. But you can cross the bridge if you ever come to it. 

Honestly this reads like more an excuse to humble brag about your ivy league education and prestigious medical degree compared to your ""stupid girlfriend."" "
"I came on here to say this. Change your name now. Passwords on any accounts you have. I would go to your financial institution and tell them your *identical twin sister* has committed fraudulent acts against you and you need to know what to do to keep your account safe as well as pull a credit report to make sure she hasn’t already taken out loans in your name, etc.

Put your health information on lockdown at your doctor’s office. If you are on your parent’s cellphone plan, it’s time to cancel AND set yourself up with a new provider. Your family has always used Verizon? You now use Sprint. At this point I would strongly urge you to delete your Facebook account. 

Do you have a relative who is a black sheep but who has always been kind to you? Perhaps you could move in with them temporarily to get yourself established somewhere new. 

It’s time to use the Grey Rock technique with your family. They lost any right to being treated with respect and decency when they chose your sister and her lies over you. Go no contact for at least 3 months to think things over.  

I know that I am basically advising the “nuclear option” but people like your sister don’t stop until they have turned you into a shell of your former self. Anyone standing by and just watching this happen (and worse, blaming you) lost any right to be called your family."
"I think the slow fade is the move here. Besides this weird stuff with guys, she is also one of those people who makes subtle comments to put me down and it's really annoying."
"CBT is cognitive behavioral therapy. Its core tenants are focused on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviors influence each other. Instead of just talking to a therapist, in CBT you learn how to better understand and challenge your thoughts inside and outside of therapy. My therapist likes to give me worksheets. It's really effective for anxiety sufferers.

DBT dialectical behavioral therapy, a type of CBT. It focuses on mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. My therapist is pretty big on meditation and mindfulness, and I find both of those to be key for keeping my anxiety controlled a minimal interference in my life."

"No, OP was saying that his mom was knocking on the closed nursery door to offer tea.  That wasn't about new mom, that was about MIL wanting inside.  "
"I feel like he's not telling you his full motivation for this. It sounds to me like he's either really turned on by the idea of you being naked onstage, or just wants to show off his hot wife to all his friends, and either way he's thinking with his wiener rather than being reasonable.

At least one of the actresses who have recently come forward about being sexually harassed by directors and producers said that the director in question -- I think it was Brett Ratner -- used the ""you have to do things you aren't comfortable with"" line to manipulate her into inappropriate situations. It's a gross cliche in the industry. Please tell your husband that."
"While all that is true... 

We are all forgetting that she is largely in this debt because her fiance promised to move in together, they COSIGNED on the lease, and he failed to move in or pay up. This is largely on him. 

This is not just about the frivoloity. This is him shafting her."
Dude that is LITERALLY using her like an uber.
"I don't get why people keep equating 'teach kids safe sex and to be responsible' with 'here is a bedroom and a bed to share'. A parent can teach their kids to be safe and responsible but still draw the line at wanting their teenagers (and 15 is still really young, they can't even drive yet) to share a bed. "
"So, since she was at school, you have allowed her almost no freedom. So she fought back, to which your response was to restrict her movements even further.

Good for her. You drove her away. 

Oh I am sure it was with the best intentions, so I won't break your balls about it, but you drove her away. A little flexibility when she was a teen, a little realisation that teens and students also need a social life, and she would not have done this.

Congrats! If you're REALLY wanting to propose on New Years maybe get a fake ring that looks real and tell her the real one is coming soon so she can have both or you can go the silly cute route and do a ring pop.
"It sounds like the girlfriend was sexually assaulted honestly, not that she cheated."
Nope. This is all on the older sister acting like a baby. 
"Exactly! OP is not being super empathetic to her here either. She's dating an alcoholic. This doesn't just affect OP it affects her. She's also feeling a lot of emotions about being in this situation and she needs to have an avenue to vent to someone. She obviously can't vent to OP so she needs another outlet.

Compromise is needed here. Maybe strictly lay out who she is and isn't allowed to speak to about this. Expecting complete privacy from her is not only unrealistic, it is dangerous. Yes she should not be telling EVERYONE, but having a couple of people she can rely on is necessary for her own mental well-being."
"this sub is insane sometimes, he talks to his friends about this trait as if she's not in the room and says IF ONLY I WERE SINGLE.

Bone char is used by a lot of sugar companies to get the white colour and are consequently not vegan. 
She can dump (or not dump) him for any reason or no reason. It’s not a meritocracy and you can’t accumulate enough points to innoculate yourself against being dumped. 
"Yes, this. My girlfriend used to work at a vet office/kennel and was bitten by a dog and the hospital informed her that in our state, they (the hospital) are REQUIRED to report all dog bites to animal control for investigation. My girlfriend chose not to press charges because the bite was an accident while they were playing, but the hospital said she was fully within her rights to if she wanted. The vet office was also annoyed with her for going to the hospital for that very reason (they didn't want it to cause trouble with their precious customers; one of the reasons she eventually left)."
"There ya go. Reset moment.

Girl...get out of there!!!  These aren't just a few red flags, these are enough to make the Communist Union go ""hang on...we need more color here"".

He doesn't respect you, he doesn't care about you, and all he cares about is how he looks.  Actually even without that, HE LEFT YOU AT THE PARK!!!!

PS. If that happens again, call EVERYBODY!  I don't care how late it is, if any of my friends were left at the park late at night I would NOT let them walk home.  I don't even have a car but I would call an uber, or three way call somebody else to make sure that this friend was safe.  All while making sure we were blasting the person that left that friend and NEVER letting that go.  The only person who should be embarrassed is your worm of a husband."
"&gt; The fact that he's embarrassed what his friends might think about you listening to kpop is really weird and screams insecurity.

Insecurity and possibly also xenophobia. In my friend circles, people themselves come from different countries, and even the ones that don't, are interested in diverse art from various countries. It's xenophobic to insist that people only consume art from the country they reside in."
"I sympathise with your sister. All you have done on all these answers is complain and whine but haven’t actually done anything to sort things out.

I’ll say it again - if you can socialise then you can work. I have great sympathy for those with anxiety disorders but very little for people who do nothing to deal with their problems. "
":( are you in a country with effective child protection authorities? Can you trust your teachers, the nuns or the priest to help you? I'm so sorry this is happening to you, you sound like an intelligent, kind and hardworking young woman. "
"My heart goes out to you.  Your mother is not a parent. She is an abuser who should never have had children.  Parents do not hit or bite (?!!!) their children. They do not tell their children horrible things. Your mother is a miserable excuse for a human being and her excuses for abusing you are not founded in reality.  She abuses you because she is jealous of you and hates herself.  You do not deserve this treatment and nothing you have endured is your fault.  Please tell someone about the abuse. Tell a trusted school counselor or teacher. They know who to call to get you the help you need. The damage your mother has caused you is immense. Please ask for help. I'm thinking of you,  sweet young lady.  Stay strong and remember that you are wonderful and that you are not the cause of your mother's shameful behaviour. "
"She is purchasing property with not-her-husband? Who is 10 years older than her? Oh, honey.

The only thing that causes me pause is the thought that this boy friend is trying to distance her from you because you have supported her when their relationship was on the rocks. You are probably a source of stability and support, which doesn't help an abusive man keep a relationship going. 

You tell a story of doing a lot of favors for her the day of her party and the morning after. And taking on a considerable dog sitting job to help her out. And this is what she thinks of you. 

This person isn't being a good friend. I bet that she will be dropping you even if you don't drop her. I almost wonder if she picked a fight with your just now so that you would back out of dog sitting, then she would be able to gain sympathy from mutual friends because you ""flaked out"" or some such non-sense. And push you out of the friend group."
"This. She's using it as an opportunity to try and convert what I would consider very vulnerable people (no family around, fish out of water, developing language and communication skills, maybe homesick). 

There are many many other venues to help international students develop their language and communication skills. Religious ones are not one of them. I moved to a foreign country and I've been approached by church folks (mainly Jehovahs Witnesses) who I know approach me because of the very reason I listed above. It's predatory."
""" Sadly, it was ruined by an explosive poop.""

Me, in reference to every baby gift my husband's extended family got us."
Then I’d say she was wearing that to get a rise out of you. I think you should just dump her as a friend. She sounds like a total shithead.
"I'm about to take a big step and move in with someone. I've never lived with anyone. I still live with my parents. I wanted to make sure I'm making the right decision and she is who I believe her to be. I don't see anything wrong with looking it up online and making sure my decision is sound.
"
Why are people getting mad that he was searching her ass up instead of being angry that she has lied to OP about something important and plans to move in and have a future with him. It is obvious that they both want to have a serious relationship. You can't be hiding something as big as that and they could be possibly married.
"Too bad then.  She wrecked all that when she came onto you.  

You can't be friends with someone who is an enemy to your marriage, it's disrespectful to your wife.

You already indulged this too much and it's causing problems at home.  Invest in your marriage instead of this friendship."
"So you acknowledge youre attracted to her, that's why you let her flirt with you and proposition you and that's why you drove her home and walked her to her door. You're being a bad husband and you lied to your wife. "
"Thank you so much. It's very awkward to talk about, but I guess I'll have to tell someone - he's meeting my cousin from the other side of the family this Thanksgiving. She's one of my best friends. While he very rarely does something to really disturb me, he does make me uncomfortable just to be around. He probably won't do anything, but I still want to say to my cousin ""don't be alone with him, don't have a conversation with only him."" 

Anyways, I appreciate your comment a lot, thank you."
"You need to sit him down and have this conversation with him asap. Parenthood is not about ""being in the mood for it"". He chose to have a child and it is as much his job as yours to care for that child. I know mothers who work, study and still have to look after their children. Then do not get the option of being ""too tired"" to parent. Fathers shouldn't either and neither should your husband. I'm sorry if I sound harsh. But I hate this mentality. parenting is a 50/50 issue. Not a 90/10 one when your hubby feels up for it. "
My partner and i are doing this - i have 6mths maternity leave and then he is taking 6mths so we won't need childcare until bubs is 12mths
"You know, if the mother of the child didn't learn how to bathe or feed her child or make sure the babies basic needs were met most people would be screaming neglect and abuse. 

She learned how without being trained. She probably bought a book, talked to other parents, and used available resources to figure it out. His penis doesn't prevent him from doing the same. Unless he's mentally handicapped he should have this figured out. There is no excuse. He is a neglectful father. 
"
If you look like Dean you should have much of an issue getting a normal girl... Just sayin.
"If anyone is qualified to make a decision about her relationship, it’s OP. She felt it was time to move on. Who in the world are any of us to tell her she is *wrong* about what she feels? 8 years is a very long time especially for one so young. She gave it a *lot* of time to know if it was right and she decided it wasn’t. "
"If he was in town and you were continuing to have sex during the transition from pill to nuvaring, I can see why he would be upset. (You can still get pregnant when beginning a new birth control). But you haven't seen him in over a month and weren't having sex. There's 0 risk here."
"&gt; I have to a degree.


I'd probably speak to her on every agree about this -- sounds as though you two were close and this is bothering you a lot. You don't just want to talk with her more -- you're also feeling bitter and forgotten. Tell her that, too."
"&gt; there were videos of them on Snapchat doing things to other people’s houses like peeing on there door step, things of that nature

And they egged your car as a ""joke""? Not to get back at you for something (and even that would be inexcusable), but just for fun? What the hell is wrong with these people? 

Stop engaging with her. Don't text her, don't message her. Step out of the group chat and talk to people individually. 

Pursue this legally, as you would if a total stranger egged your car. File a police report, follow it up with your insurance company, tell your manager. "
Fuck your gate keeping nonsense. Just because it's not traumatizing for you doesn't mean it is not for someone else. 
"&gt; In the car ride, it's okay to aim for music all can agree on, 

Even then, the driver's word is law. The driver needs to  be okay with the selection, because it's the driver who's going to kill everyone in that car and potentially other cars if they are distracted by music that is too loud, or irritates them, or anything.

It's okay to find a compromise, but a car is not a democracy. 

Also, everything else everybody says, especially about the ""I thought we talked about this"" bit."
"I am so, so sorry this happened to you. This is so traumatic and such a breach of trust. I would definitely recommend going to the police. Also, if you need it, there’s no shame in getting therapy. "
"Has this topic ever come up before then? If she'd be ok with a second-hand ring? If not, I wouldn't assume that she'd be happy with it even if she's happy with a lab grown diamond. I want a lab grown diamond, but I would be really upset if my boyfriend got me a second-hand ring."
"Here it is. This needs to be higher. 

OP, it's time to defend your husband. You absolutely need to be on his side and it's past time to start calling your mother out on her bullshit. "
"&gt;Ever since my GF ignores me a whole day if she knows I talked to another female, even a coworker, and constantly brings up how she's worried I might leave her over her laziness. 

She knows it is a problem, refuses to fix it, and takes it out on you.  She also has jealousy issues.

You need to have a serious, possibly even come-to-Jesus talk with her about this.  You shouldn't have to put up with this, you deserve so much better."
If you really care about him like you say you'll let him have the space he needs. If its school that ended this relationship like you said then I'm sure he's hurting right now and needs space to get over the fact that the relationship ended. Let him have it.
Because accepting his apology puts her on the higher ground in this sparring match. He wasn't actually apologizing. I think it was a great response myself.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. I don't even care about the waste - I just wouldn't want a cake smashed in my face. Are people allowed to refuse? What about people who wear makeup and then have it all ruined? What about people with sensitive skin who don't want sugar frosting all over their face? What about people who just don't want to be smashed in the face with a cake? This is absurd. 
"Hi OP. It seems like you're into Nina. If you want to break up with your girlfriend because you have no shares interests and she's not a Nina-type girl, please do so now so that she can find someone who wants to be with her. :)  
  
Goodluck on your search for a girl like Nina, although to be honest, I think you just want to have Nina as your girlfriend and while there's no guarantee that you'll get her or someone like her, it would be unfair to stick with your girlfriend now if she's not someone you want to be with."
"I'm baffled how you don't see that your boyfriend is 100% the problem. David can crush on your boyfriend and try to drive a wedge between you all he wants, but the only way for that to be effective is for your boy friend to let it happen, which it sounds like he does. If he set boundaries and stood up for you, nothing David could do would be detrimental to your relationship. He's not a puppet that David is controlling, he's a person with autonomy who can decide what kind of people influence his choices and relationships.

&gt; there is a saying you are the sum of your friends surrounding you

&gt; he only picks people to hang out who are deeply disturbed (married men cheating on their partners, going to prostitutes, cheating, women creating drama, etc.

I mean...what does this tell you?

It sounds like David isn't some weird anomaly, he's yet another kind of shitty person that your boyfriend has attached himself to because maybe he's kind of a shitty person too."
"First thing for him (and you if you've had sex since he came home) is to get tested for STDs. Has he asked his friends what happened? They might have more info and help him remember. 

Honestly, I think you could work through this. If he's genuinely apologetic and makes efforts to rein in the drinking (at the very least be more cognizant of it) and you think you can trust him again, you can make a go of it. But only you can know that, not internet strangers. 

I'd break up in a hot second if he refused to get tested though. "
"&gt; That said, you have never been able to find a job? And you're 26 years old? I'm sorry, but I have to call BS on that.

This was my reaction as well. I developed Depression, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I was 13; they went untreated until I was 20 years old. I'm 29 now and have been working pretty steadily since I was 18 - this includes most summers between semesters as well as full time work since I graduated in 2012. Of course, I am not a doctor but I do often wonder if the difference between me and someone like the OP isn't that I am suffering less or coping better but rather I simply cannot move home, nor would I want to. I push myself through some shit situations because I can't imagine moving back into my childhood bedroom and I don't know that it would even be an option. Not maintaining a job would mean starving to death on the street. Hardly what I would call a life goal of mine...

Having said that, I can't speak to the state of things in the UK with regards to Disability and obtaining it with anxiety, but in the US it's not the easiest thing to lock down. In the UK, it looks like you can't just go, ""Yeah I don't work, pay me"" - you have to prove that normal day-to-day activities are difficult and that doesn't just mean work. It means socializing, maintaining hobbies, friendships, everything. But OP just said:

&gt;She babysits 1-2 times a week **so I can have a social life.**

This may sound mean but I'm personally really not into paying X amount from my paycheck towards people who have ""anxiety"" when it comes to working but can manage to date, have kids, and socialize. Some days I cry in the bathroom at work, some days I quietly fidget at my desk while I panic, but I get my ass to work. I know others who do the same. I can't help but feel a little aggravated that I can do that, am too wiped to socialize at the end, but posters are in here telling this woman to apply for government aid so she can go out with friends a few days a week. Fuck I don't even go out a few days a month but I'll just be here working, thanks."
"&gt; You should look into receiving disability from the state for this if you can't hold down a job because of it. 

The problem here is that OP openly admits to maintaining a social life. You can't just apply for free cash because you don't have a job and blame anxiety; not even a diagnosis of anxiety is enough. She's in the UK, which seems to mirror the US, in that they want proof that this is a truly disabling condition. Dating, having a baby, and going out a few times a week with friends falls laughably short of meeting those requirements. She'd have to do some hardcore lying to get around it and as someone who suffers with anxiety - diagnosed - I find that abhorrent."
"You cleaning the house for her isn't going to fix anything. And I'm pretty sure there's nothing you can say that will magically get her to open her eyes, because other people have said stuff and she hasn't listened. Maybe there's a mental illness, or domestic abuse, or some other external factor going on. Maybe they're just both slobs. 

I say you call CPS yourself and let her work it out with them. You can take custody of the baby if it comes down to that, but maybe an external authority will give her the push she needs to pull herself together. "
"Matt is actually out right now, so I will have to ask him when he gets back.

"There is a need to worry, until a med check clears him - and daddy shouldn’t plan on it ever doing so just because it’s less work for him to think that way. Yes it would be wonderful of problems could just disappear because they were stressful, but he’s meant to be living in an adult world where problems must be dealt with and planned around, not a fantasy one. 

He needs to start stepping up rather than hiding from responsibilities. That includes taking care of feeding the toddler at least occasionally. 

He also dodged responsibility for forgetting to buy the right foods, by the way, and deflected it into an accusation of you being picky about pizza. Seems like hiding from responsibility is a learned behavior for him.  "
If you speak to him he will just tell you whatever you need to hear....

You should run. I used to date a guy who would go through my phone. I woke up a few times because he tried to be sneaky and unlock my phone while I was sleeping. Then he started going through my mail and my e-mails. At the end of the relationship I couldn't even go to the grocery store alone and he became *very* abusive. This is a giant red flag.

"You can care greatly for another person, and not be compatible. A breakup doesn't have to be because someone is a raging asshole or abusive or they were cheating, aka it doesn't have to be for dramatic or painful reasons.

You're not excited about your future together. *That* is a perfectly legit reason to break up. Relationships can be work, yes, but it shouldn't feel like a struggle to be excited about someone. If people ask, ""it wasn't working out"" is a good enough answer, along with ""let's talk about something else""."
Why? They were authorized by the husband to start working. The fact that he did it against OP's desires is not their problem.

"&gt; At Christmas dinner at my grandma’s, my dad talked my brother into letting me move in with him. He accepted and I moved in shortly after. **He forgave me and everything was cool.**

I'm lost. You decided to move out, you gave him your car. Life didn't turn out that well. You moved back with family, whilst working and still getting your shit together. And he was a position to *forgive* you of something?

He has quit jobs multiple times knowing you would step in and cough-up the rent. He's not sad you've left and he's going to miss his sister, he's angry that he can no longer flop about on his arse all day and get life handed to him on a silver plate.

You should have equal say in how the money is spent. If he's spending 400 dollars a month every month and blowing up when you ask what it's on, he's the one being suspicious and behaving like a shit partner, not you.

You said she was causing drama by being angry at you for not inviting her on your hunting trip, but now you're pissed at her for not inviting you to her party? How is that not hypocritical of you? Also, it's pretty self-centered to assume she moved away because she thinks she's better than you. If she's 26 and buying an apartment (sounds like it might even be her second home), she's doing really well financially so I'm sure moving was a great life choice for her. Honestly it sounds like you're projecting a lot of your own insecurities onto Mira and assuming she's trying to piss you off when in all likelihood, she's not even thinking about you at all. "

What good is a joke without the payoff of a laugh at the end. I would expect him to come busting out of the room laughing a minute or two later. Unless he is just really wanting to fuck with OP's head for a day or two but I say if he hasn't revealed the joke after a few days it's definitely not a joke. 
"&gt; Ouch. This hit a little close to home. Now I'm sad.


Sorry to make you sad, friend, you were collateral damage!


For what it's worth, this is a tough situation. It requires work from both partners.


On one end, there must be a commitment to honesty and openness. On the other end, there must be a commitment to making one's self a safe person to be honest with.


The trick is to knowing what is causing the problem. In the OP, he was clearly in the wrong and hiding it from his wife - so he was the problem. But let's change the scenario a little bit. Let's say hypothetically he did nothing to encourage his colleague, she hit on him, and he firmly and unambiguously turned her down - if his wife flipped out when he told her about it, then she would be the problem. Alternatively, OP could have done nothing to encourage her, *and* his wife could be an understanding and empathetic person to be honest with, and yet he still could have hidden it because of his own anxiety about conflict. Three different problems.


Don't know which it is in your case, but best of luck anyways.  "
"Your sister went about it the wrong way, but she is right. 

I read all the replies and you never once answered why your mom has to babysit your daughter if:

1. You have no job
2. You’re not currently seeing any therapist

No, I’m sorry but you’re letting your sickness define you and are dragging your mom into this whole mess. You’re adult enough to have a kid, then you should be adult enough to handle the responsibility that comes with all of it. "
"Exactly. She is very clearly stating you weren't fun/sexy/whatever enough to date when she was young, but now that she's older she's willing to accept she can't land for marriage any of those fun/sexy/whatever guys so is willing to settle for you. Fuck that noise.

This would be a VERY different situation if she hadn't said earlier when asked if she wanted to date you that you were appropriate for her only when she was older. If she had said back then she wasn't interested, sitcom-noir would have a point---sometimes people need to learn what shit looks like by going through it and only then can appreciate the awesome right in front of them.

Again, that is NOT what she said. She very clearly stated she recognized you were appropriate for the ""settle"" of a 30 year old women, but not acceptable for her until she reached that point.

You can do better. You can be with someone who doesn't think you're a settle."
"I’m glad he’s seeing a therapist, that was more than my ex ever did. I ended up divorcing for other things too but it was so strange to discover how much of those other things were tied to the alcohol. Our sex life took a nosedive and I thought it was because I had a low libido. Therapy and space made me realize I don’t and that I was so resentful about his drinking I could not feel attraction towards him. So many problems in our relationship were a direct result of the booze, even ones you think wouldn’t be.

I hope your hubby is making the effort. Divorce sucks but it was the best decision I’ve ever made because I could not imagine my life being his booze police and I definitely couldn’t imagine my son growing up around that. My mom did and she hated her dad for a long time growing up. I did t want that for my kid. "
"This sub has a reputation of being trigger happy for ending relationships because half the posts in here are people who know they need to break up with their SO, but need the outside push to do so.

"Your friend obviously has some serious self esteem issues and I feel sorry for her. You hurt right now, but she's going to have a far worse time than you are in life. I'm so sorry"
"I think you should let her move out. You're both in a raw place right now after such a loss. Both of you could benefit from seeing a therapist as this is an extremely traumatic event. 

Give your girlfriend some time. Let her know you love her and will be around when she's ready, but it's clear she needs time and perspective (especially since she believes you wanted to baby to die!). "
"Except for the sister I feels like all those bits of information are accomplishments or skills of his. If he is shy like you say, he may see sharing those things as ""bragging"" and feel bad about doing that unprompted.

I know I've personally been with partners who knew very little about me because of a combination of A) me not wanting to bring attention to myself and fearing i'd come across as self-involved and B) them having very little curiosity about me and never asking personal questions. 

So, you did't know he had a sister. Meaning, in these 5 months, you never asked him if he had siblings? I'm assuming he didn't lie to you about it, right? I'm sure he'll be forthcoming enough if you help him explore anecdotes from his past with more questions!"
She also originally told you she never slept with any of her sugar daddies. She lies. It's been seven months. Cut your loses and move on.
"I feel like this is really the only solution.

Your average level ""jealous/insecure boyfriend"" response to this would usually be ""I'm concerned about her and Jake going together, but she's with 2 teachers so there isn't likely to be much opportunity for shenanigans. Still, I think I'll find some sneaky reason to facetime call her a couple of times at night cause jealousy and insecurity"".

This reaction passes that by a million miles. Jumping straight to ""you aren't allowed out of my sight with other men of any age group, regardless of the circumstances, because you'll just orgy with all of them regardless of age"" pretty much says that this relationship is not going the distance anyway. The jealousy would eat away at his personality until he was just this rotten shell of what he once was, and there would eventually come a point where you realize just being with him at the grocery store is more stressful than tax time. 

I would feel pretty confident that this conversation was the logical end of the relationship. At this point it's a matter of when everyone parts ways."
So everyone in mistress’s orbit is supposed to suffer? The sister didn’t condone the cheating and certainly can’t convince her sister of the error of her ways now. She’ll find out in time most likely and doesn’t need to deal with Op’s (rightfully) intense feelings.
"I'm a woman and my fiance is a man, and he's a constant complainer.  If something isn't to my liking, I quietly fix it and go about my day. If something isn't perfect for him, he complains about it. He says that he's ""not making real complaints"", just conversation, but it's incredibly annoying to me. Can't we talk about how great things are instead?"
"He *did* say no when she first told him she was in contact with his brother. She disregarded that and then went behind his back to socialize wit his family and dragged her kids along in the bargain.

It's about what *she* wants, not what he wants or needs. So, yeah, she's a raging narcissist. "
"Ok, I also am crying."
"They way she goes on dates is sort of duplicitous and mean.  She's leading these guys on, getting them to buy her drinks and dinner, maybe even entertainment, then after flirting and teasing she rejects their advances and then goes home to you where you mock the guys as she even has you impersonate her and play with these guys over media.

That's using the guys and frankly just cold and mean spirited towards them.  

She should stop doing that sort of thing."
"My curious side kinda wants to see what happens if you keep burdening her by being a Sitcom Husband who does nothing.

Burn dinner repeatedly. Stop vacuuming or do it so badly she has to do it herself. Never pick up the post or cancel a subscription so she has to chase it up herself. Ask her to book your appointments. Etc. 

At what point will she realise she can't do everything herself and screaming at people has a hard limit on effectiveness? All it takes is one person who either doesn't play by the rules or doesn't give a fuck to either belt the living shit out of her or put her into meltdown mode because they don't care that she's pissed at them.

I knew a woman like this, and you know what? While she wasn't entirely unhappy, in her later years she realised her attitude and behaviours had alienated a lot of worthwhile people. It's sad."
"Here's what I'm seeing:

&gt; I'd really like to be **married** within the next two years 

&gt;  ""So when are you going to ask me officially?"" ""Sometime within...next twelve months."" 

You wanted to be *married*, ring on the finger and paperwork signed, by (ostensibly) August 2018. Your partner appears to have no interest in even getting engaged for another 12 months, and then god only knows how long he wants the engagement to be. 

I think it's totally fair to approach him and say, ""Your answer doesn't suit me. I told you my timeline and you agreed to it. You are not being open to me about any milestones or goals that you want to tick off before we get engaged, you're just putting the matter off indefinitely. Right now, I'm no longer comfortable continuing to wait for another twelve months. You simply saying I won't be stuck waiting indefinitely isn't good enough, especially when you've provided no evidence to the contrary.""

I know you want him to propose to you, so you have a proposal story that *he* took initiative on, but I think it's already too late. He's already dragging his feet and forcing you to be the one to take action *again*. So I think you need to give up on the proposal story, the nice memory, and just ask him, ""Are we getting married, yes or no? If yes, what's stopping us? Let's make it happen now.""

But honestly, I think you need to ask yourself whether you really want to be with a man who's refusing to give you an honest answer, and is happy to keep you dangling on a string. "
"Getting a relationship back on track from a break requires concerted effort from both partners. 

Sleeping with someone else even on technicality shows no effort towards making the relationship work by one partner. "
"So why even slow fade her?  Just tell her what’s happening, have Allison there to back you up, and tell her the friendship is over."
"If you keep pushing like this, you are going to drive your SIL away entirely and then you really WILL have a hard time seeing your niece. Your brother married *her*, not you guys. if you're Italians you're catholic, and you've certainly heard that people getting married are supposed to leave their birth family and cleave to their new spouse, right? "
"&gt;  Friday to a clean house, hot dinner, groceries and laundry done

How important are these things to him really?
Like I know you like doing them but if he's perfectly happy to do them himself if it means you're in a better mood and not complaining for an hour, maybe he'd prefer that?

"
"&gt; Having a baby NEVER EVER fixes the situation.

Because marrying him worked WONDERS.

Oh, wait..."
"Life doesn't go in rewind. If you want the healthy friendship back, you're probably going to get that only if you make a new friend."
"I agree that men are not innately conservative when it comes to expressions of affection towards other men. I do believe that it is largely social conditioning whether men show affection to other men since it varies around the world, but I do not believe hand holding, kissing, and cuddling men exists to the extent you are implying. 

You have to take into mind the significance of the gesture too. Like kissing cheeks is very common around the world between men but the context is different from what OP is implying. The kissing is 99% of the time used as a greeting, it doesn’t have the same connotation. It’s actually a lot like shaking hands is for us in America. Also the idea of personal space varies differently around the world. Like the boundaries of personal space between men vary incredibly between Norway and India. 

No as I am typing this I think what separates men from performing intimate gestures is whatever or not the gesture has the “lovey-dovy” connotation it has when a boy cuddles up with his girlfriend. It’s weird for us to see men express gestures of love and compassion and overall emotion I guess "
"Anniversaries are important, sure, but they don't have to be celebrated on the exact date. An anniversary celebration between two people is also far easier to move around in a schedule than a big birthday party with many people. I completely understand why she's giving priority to a friend's birthday party here.

I can also understand why she wasn't itching to invite you. It's not her party, it's her friend's. Sure, you might be friendly with the birthday girl, but obviously not enough to merit an invite of your own. And that's OK. Your girlfriend probably *can* show up to the party with you in tow, but honestly, you're at an age where showing up with you SO is not a given, and where an invitation to one member of a couple is not an unspoken invitation to the other. Just because she *can* bring you, doesn't mean the birthday girl or her friend group will be thrilled by your unexpected presence. It kinda sucks that she had to come out and say she didn't want you to come, but that's likely more because you'd be making things awkward by violating the social norms within her friend circle, and not because she doesn't like spending time with you.

Celebrate your anniversary next week. Be confident enough in your relationship that you don't feel you need to be joined at the hip. Be your own person outside of your girlfriend. You'll both be happier."
"He was most likely hoping to inspire some kind of feelings in you towards him so that when he did this you would be more inclined to stick around as a fwb.

Its not an unheard of tactic but it makes him so much more of an asshole for doing it."
"Was he remorseful at all?  It really doesn't sounds like it.  It is still creepy, but the most important thing is how it made you feel, and it doesn't seem like he cared."
"Exactly. 

In my situation, the cheating wasn't even with the girl from the pictures. It was with another woman a few months later. According to my ex, the coworker they had all the pictures of never went further than dirty texts.

But the pictures were the first sign. I wish I had walked away then. It would have been less messy, less painful. 

"
"She's not just a moron.  She's a sexual predator.  If the sexes were reversed, a man spying on a physically vulnerable woman whom he knew was naked, people would be calling for his blood.  "
Maybe she just took the selfies for her own personal need. I’ve done this and never sent to my boyfriend. I just wanted to feel sexy but didn’t have the confidence to send it to him. 
"Then say ""It's a little weird for me, but I'll get over it."" Don't pass judgment on their relationship and don't make your issues their problem."
"Please, point me to a ""worldwide scandal"" where an person was not allowed to have a bank account and had one, and that in itself was the crime."
"If that's the case, that's fine. Either it'll happen within the next six months or I'm gone.

Silence is a weak ass way to live. Anyone who can't honestly vocalize their wants shouldn't be in a relationship."
Why? Do you not think that forcibly groping someone against their will is assault?
Not all the time. My divorce went to court and my ex paid me every month. It depends on the jurisdiction you’re in. My point was that people definitely pay their ex’s instead of having their checks garnished. 
"This^ 

Lawyer up, delete social media, hit the gym, get joint/total custody"
"Firstly I don't think you know what triggering is. Annoys him would be a better term.

And his ex is right. His behaviour bares all the hallmarks of alcoholism. Right up to the denial, insistence that it's normal, lying and sneaking about.

You cant force him to acknowledge that this is a problem. And if he won't then he won't get better. All you can do it walk away"
"By leaving. This is abuse. He has no respect for you, no concern for your safety. Anything could have happened to you and instead he called you a wh^re."
"No he is the most antisocial and quirkiest man I have ever met. No exaggeration he should/would be diagnosed something if he were ever evaluated. Nice guy most of the time but a switch flips if he is ever challenged or if he feels he was left out of something, no matter how small. "
I truly feel bad for his wife. She deserves better. I woulda been out the damn door
"He kicked you out of a car with a broken arm. Throw him in the trash, because he's garbage."
"Doesn’t sound like a slip. She took him aside and “accidentally” mentioned it... really? She was showing him Russian books? What kid wants to see books on Russian culture randomly? “Gauge his reaction”? Like, he’ll just connect and somehow know he was adopted from there despite no one ever telling him.

But, I think the kid should know. He’s 13. I don’t understand why parents keep it a secret. When they’re young and don’t quite grasp the concept, okay. After that? Did they plan to keep hiding it for another five years, ten, forever?

Your wife is lying to cover her actions"
"Also assuming you guys stick it out and go the distance, there's some advantage to having your kids grown and mostly independent in your 40's - you'll still be young enough to enjoy your post-childrearing life for quite some time, and you'll likely be around for a lot of your grandchildren's life, too. "
"That's not deranged, that's just an asshole."
"I don't think he's your bf anymore. A lost phone doesn't mean he can't contact you. 

I think you need to accept that he's done the ghost. This is over. Just because he doesn't say the words, doesn't mean you haven't been dumped. "
"She sat on her betrayal for a week and acted like nothing was wrong. As much as it sucks her character can't exactly be trusted here. 
"
"This is a you issue. I honestly think that you should consider therapy, because you're taking something totally innocent and going way too far. 

"
I really thought it would be about her being sexually attracted to ghosts and op had been legally dead and resuscitated or something. Very disappointed.
"Sounds like he's being honest with you. You should tell him exactly why you're uncomfortable with this. Him saying that you shouldn't judge the cheaters he was with is a red flag, but it's possible he's just defensive of his friends. 

As a guy, I get that bachelor parties are sort of mandatory, but that party sounds way over the top. If he makes a habit of it, I would definitely not tolerate that, and I wouldn't feel obligated to hang out with his friends since they're such scumbags. "
"I love my nuvaring, best decision I made, and I feel like you made the right decision since you felt it was part of a larger pattern. Hope you’re doing ok, make sure to treat yourself well as you recover from the breakup."
"&gt; PS. She's going to DESTROY you in the divorce.

wow can you imagine.

She is apparently STILL in full battle with her own mother over the wedding arrangements, a year on"
I would be pretty mad over someone acting that immature over a minor tall too.
"It's always rough to lose a friend and her reaction was pretty nasty (though she did make her own grave here), but you definitely did the right thing in letting her husband know. The way she reacted says a lot about her character, and from the looks of it she would've continued what she was doing if you didn't say anything which is super unfair for her husband. Good on you and hopefully things smooth out with time. You've been a good friend."
"I have to laugh, having foolishly wasted my time on the exact same situation when I was your age.

Spoiler alert: he knows precisely how he is making you feel. That’s the point. He’s training you to swallow your dissenting opinions. He’s training you like a dog so that your self esteem crumbles to nothing, you think you deserve his abuse, and you learn that you have no rights in this relationship.

Your boyfriend isn’t magically so oblivious and stupid that he “doesn’t understand” how being nasty to a person would make them feel. If he was, you’d be taking advantage by dating someone that deeply mentally handicapped. Even someone with an IQ so low that they wouldn’t be allowed custody of their own child is aware that when you’re mean to people, it hurts their fucking feelings. 

You’re doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to excuse his behavior and to not have to face the attitude underlying it.

He’s hurting you on purpose. He’s hurting you WITH purpose- to tear you down so far you stop trying to get back up. He likes abusing you. He likes hurting you. It’s fun for him. Like a hobby. "
"Yeah I'm not 100$ sure it was a ""stupid-only"" decision.

I hope it's not the case, but maybe he wanted to get back at OP for some reason and ruining her most valuable possession under a false good intent was in his mind, the best way to do it."
"Your desire to spend New Years with your family seems pretty normal to me.  It's not like it's a particularly ""family"" holiday anyway.

My gut response here is that her ""incredible upset"" and crying is simply her method to get you to change your mind.  Sometimes even married couples go to separate holiday functions when the logistics just won't work out.

"
"OP, print this out and read it word for word when you call your mom. And stick to it."
