You don't go to an office supply store for free boxes... Try a grocery store.
"I would have insisted that they wait while you check what has and hasn't gone through as she scanned some things herself you have no idea if things went through correctly/were mis-priced etc. It's security for her and for the store, after all ;)"
"I thought this story was going to be about some old lady yelling at you for something that's her fault and saying ""a child could do your job better than you!"" I'm so glad I was wrong. "
"How do you see where they're coming from lol 

If you stopped helping them to chit chat with your regular, that would be very rude. But it sounds like they were waiting, you were manning your post, and greeted another customer. 

Old man is an ass hat. "
Just......what the actual fuck
Holy crap I wish I'd thought of that in the moment! Would have wasted more of her precious time 
Maybe if customers learned how to read there would be less problems... we can only dream.
"""Yes, I would like to revise my statement.  Take a screen shot of the page where it says that, and come talk to my manager so you can embarrass yourself by showing that you cannot read, and have failed to master common human decency and humility went confronted by the fact that you made a mistake..."""
Or a drycleaners. That's where I get mine. They have huge boxes of hangers and other things that typically get tossed anyway.
"""Do you have this in stock?""

""No we are sold out.""

""So you don't have this in stock?""

""No we are sold out.""

""So you're sold out of this?""

*facepalm*"
"It's funny how such a small gesture could make your 21st birthday so much more memorable. Really cool story, thanks for sharing!"
"Flip side of that is when you check the back, and miraculously the thing you're looking for is right on top and you can actually get to it.  But the customers never understand how impressive it is that you actually found it."
"If something like this happens again void the sale and start over by emptying the bags and pushing everything back past the scanner. 

As soon as you turned your back and she scanned an item you lost control of the transaction. Next time make sure you wrest control back. "
"Just remember to answer with ""I'd agree with you but then we'd both be wrong."""
Excellent balance of sarcasm and politeness.  Bravo!
"Something kind of similar happened to me.

I work in a wine tasting room, and I had a couple in their early 50's at the bar. A very young looking couple walked in, and when I asked to see their ID's, the woman in her 50's pipes in with ""You didn't ask for my ID"", which is something get all the time.  I have a few corny jokes programmed to respond with to diffuse the situation (as I have had some people legitimately angry that I didn't ID them, even though they are clearly 50+).

I went with ""Well I felt like I could trust you folks, these guys however look kind of shady."" They laugh, the young couple laughs, I pour some wine and everyone has a good time. A few days later we got a 1 star review from a grumpy woman who was standing at the other end of the bar by herself (I tried conversing with her, got nothing but cold, disinterested 1 word answers), saying that I had the audacity to call paying customers ""shady"".

Whatever lady."
"This is actually one of my worst fears, alongside losing my teeth after falling down, face first.

EDIT: I'm really glad I'm not alone in this, hahaha!"
Having a degree doesn't magically give you some kind of colour superpower. My best friend's bf is doing his masters in engineering. He's colourblind.
"That's absolutely disgusting. I wouldn't let them back in after that. We aren't allowed to ban people at name brand children store, but I'd do it anyways. I'd be like ""no. Leave or I call security"""
"You know, with these types of customers, you should always remember that there's Knowing someone, and Knowing Of them, and the latter isn't always for reasons that they'd be proud of......"
"Oh, wow, that is a new level of disgusting... Why would anyone even consider that to be acceptable behavior? I'm glad to hear you had an understanding boss, though!"
“I don’t know what to tell you since I’m stupid and can’t read.” Amazing! Lmao! 
"""You are without a doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of.""  

""But you have heard of me."""
"Screen printing shops too. The last time we had to move, they showed us a room with empty boxes stacked to the ceiling and told us to take what we needed and then take more lol"
"It absolutely is, except at places that...you know....SELL boxes. Haha"
I don't have OCD but even I feel like washing my hands now. I'm amazed at the reaction of your boss and coworkers too (in a good way!).
Or an office supply store. Some of them get so many boxes they have special equipment to crush them. 
"My little sister is on the spectrum and she automatically faces labels and tidies shelves while we shop. I tell her she doesn't have to, but she says she loves to. So, I guess it does make a difference to the staff. "
"Seriously, do these people not realize that they do this to their fellow human beings? "
"Bet she won't be receiving the ""common decency"" or ""reading comprehension"" patches anytime soon"
"""Can you check in the back?""

*double facepalm*"
"This story gives new meaning to 'Out of sight, out of mind'!

Although, I'd really love to see her 'aha' moment when she decided that cutting off the exceptions would make them no longer matter. I bet it would have been hilarious!"
"Reminds me of the time a girl peed on the floor in our carpeted fitting room, and then wiped with one of our shirts. It was a crazy Friday and we didn't pinpoint who it was til she had run off. 

Stank so bad we had to close the fitting rooms for the rest of the night and have it professionally cleaned the next day. RIP her kidneys- there is no way a healthy person did that. "
"I'd like to also add the wife was rolling her eyes, looking at her husband and shaking her head and muttering too. She was absolutely awful and I hoped for the next 6 months on registers I'd never see her again....."
"Thank god im actually off registers and in the deli department (...but equally as crazy interactions) and haven't dealt with it again. But if it ever happens again in my life time that is what I will be doing, with some choice words to go with it ! "
"&gt; ""We'd like to return this. It still has the tags on but we've lost our receipt""

No receipt. No return. What? Your dying grandmother bought it for you and it's her last wish that you return it for money to pay for a liver transplant for your disabled daughter? SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE RECEIPT THEN!"
I find that most customers don't seem to see workers as human beings.
I go to liquor stores for boxes. They get a lot of them and most don't have space to spare to store empties for recycling. 
I work in a retail setting and its somewhat common to give away our empty boxes
"Or bought and drank the glue. Either way, problem solves itself!"
"I like how she asked you direct her somewhere else. I never understood customers that do this. 

I also bet the 14 year old would have been into the books or whatever she could pick up at your place. He clearly had some sort of interest in science considering she went to you to get his gift. "
That sounds like a nightmare. At my job there's no easy way to do a return for that many items
"It wasn't rude though. When people tell me something is rude, I ask them to explain how it's rude.

That bitch wouldn't be getting put through to the other department until she explained."
"I'll leave you this:

I'm sure if the kid then 'accidentally' scanned something twice they'd expect to see a manager five minutes ago and have the entire bill paid for.
I never understood why more stores aren't allowed to ban people. I think employee safety comes before customer satisfaction. 
"This happened to me once. I searched a special item in a store and couldn't find it so I asked a staff member. He helped me search but we only found an empty box. He then wanted to have a look in the back because a shipping just arrived and it's a very small store so it's actually possible to have a look.

 He asked me to follow him to the door but upon opening the door we both saw the arcticle sitting on top of a pile. We both were amused how impossible this should have been."
"My eight year old nephew and his friends can barely handle a sippy cup of juice let alone a five year old with a god damn fuel pump. Kids are random, one minute they're fueling up no problem the next they're chugging gasoline from the nozzle because hey it looked like apple juice! (No that has not happened to my knowledge)"
Liquor stores! There was a period of my life when I moved once a year and I never paid for boxes. I'd hit up three or four liquor stores and have more than enough. 
"Why do all customers think they're so special that every employee will *of course* remember them, from that one time, like two years ago?

At least she didn't try the other, escalated, variation of this theme - the ""I know the owner"" trick.  I've had customers try this on me, and they didn't even know the owner's name!"
"Obviously he needs two masters, not just one."
Because understanding that would mean admitting that you are a human being. This is more of a challenge for people than many would like to admit.
"Right? If OP went out drinking, they probably wouldn't remember their 21st that clearly"
"""you see, they're in *the building*, but they're being unpacked from a whoooole lot of pallets stacked up really high so it might take hours until we actually find it. It could be under refrigerators for all I know! You *can* wait if you *can't wait* haha :) but if it's not an emergency then realistically it's going to be sometime later today or tomorrow. I know that's inconvenient that the website was misleading - it's not intended to be... so I'll pass along that feedback and suggest that we perhaps add a delay to how quickly the website says it's in stock"" "
It is always the people who make the transaction take 10x longer who complain about how long it is taking.
Same. I only had the faintest hope that the story would turn out the way it did
"Wtf, in my head I image it as someone going down the conveyor belt and being scanned, you know what I mean?"
I was pretty much screaming at my boss to get it off me... Poor guy. I apologised to him afterwards but he understood.
"*Sir, that is not even close to the most insensitive thing I could say.*"
"D'aaaaawwwwww!  They are so cute!  What great guys.

Best 21st birthday ever!"
Old man is just salty that you couldn't magically teleport his order into his car and was looking for things to complain about.
🤔🤔
