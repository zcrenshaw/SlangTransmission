Seems like you dodged  a bullet there.
‚ÄúOn and off girlfriend‚Äù That sounds like disaster to begin with.
"My favorite memory is going to sound weird. I was chasing a subject, and we ran up a deck. He popped out and hit me in the stomach with a baseball bat, and I fell off the deck (only about a 5 foot fall). I had to go to the hospital and stay for a few days, but I met a nurse. Who is now my fiance. "

Send me a message if you need someone to talk to. Life throws us some shitty pitches sometimes - I'm here for you if you need someone to help prop you up on your feet. "
No questions for you. My heart hurts for you. You deserve happiness and success in everything you do. Best of luck to you in this chapter of your life.

lots and lots of failed relationships. But with each one I have gotten better. I have been hospitalized 7 times. Attempted suicide 3 times. Im now 31 just screwed up another relationship but I think this may be the last one I make a mistake on. I learn how to interact socially a little more each time I make a mistake.

What's the world population after WWIII?

Did she hit rock bottom?
They dont make dad jokes there the cool and hip dads lmao
That actually   happened after humanity cured the common cold.
Do you have to suffer...double the dad jokes or is that a myth?
"Mutual friends, Whisper posts, Fetlife posts.....

We personally vet all applicants for a few weeks before we accept them. Then there is a mandatory STI screening within 30 days before the date. A waiver is signed stating such before you even pass through the foyer."
"No, but I did take a just-legal girl's cherry as the only dude in a 4 way once...."
"He told her that if she stays with me, then he would fight her in court to get full custody of their daughter. She became so overwhelmed and depressed that she attempted suicide 3 days later."
"I was born in the united states, and it was my middle school teacher who started to question what was going on. "
What is up with child porn in the future? It would be fucked up if it were legal. 
Nothing to add except i am a male abuse survivor as well.  Good on you for moving forward.  It sounds like you are doing quite well.
Voice is a lot. I also send my aunt pics of people and she describes them lol 
We called the police immediately. 
I hope your a abusers went to jail. Stay strong!
"they were seemily normal people even to me. Even when I was abused they were ""nice"" about it. They made it seem like  this is just how the world was. "
I never would of said anything. the shame was too great. It was my Middle School teacher who asked what was going on and got the ball running. I swear that man saved my life.
Does she know u were planning on proposing
Do they instruct you on how to be so damn nice? 
No street wear allowed.
"We require that everyone shows up sober, and we spend a portion of time playing dirty party games and sharing a few drinks.

"1 yes its my aunt she doesnt want kids cuase she is asexual 

2 no

3 sometimes "
I don't know they both answer and i just point to the dad i need
yes
" Not OP but can answer, former cop:

Sometimes nothing. Sometimes random BS. Depends on the circumstance and why they‚Äôre going to jail. Usually they want to know what the process is going to be like, how long it‚Äôs going to take. Return customers are begging to be OR‚Äôed or cited if it‚Äôs a minor crime they‚Äôre taking a ride for. 

Contrary to popular belief (fed by media) they have not been read Miranda while being cuffed in most cases. If it‚Äôs an arrest that happened because of PC that night I don‚Äôt need to ask any questions after they‚Äôre arrested (domestic violence, DWI) so I will purposefully not engage in communication of a questioning nature. Of course spontaneous utterance (truth vomit) happens and I‚Äôll be recording everything they say,

Random comments from my backseat:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill you after I rape your wife‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù

‚ÄúI fucked up, my life is ruined‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for being cool about all this‚Äù

‚ÄúCall Granny and tell her where I am and that I‚Äôll be late for Thanksgiving dinner‚Äù (one of my cousins that had a warrant)

(Incoherent sobbing)

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even that drunk‚Äù (que vomiting)

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to throw up‚Äù (my response was always ‚Äúgo ahead, trustees will clean it up after we get to the jail‚Äù Never pull over while in transit unless it‚Äôs a legit medical emergency and even then only with backup very close).

‚ÄúI never fucked my daughter she just gave me head‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that Mexican music?‚Äù (Plain white guy but for giggles I‚Äôll play a local Spanish channel loud enough so they can hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to shit my pants‚Äù (shits pants)

‚ÄúI have to piss‚Äù (pees pants)

‚ÄúHey man, I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt look like a bitch when I get in there so imma kick and scream when we get in. Try not to beat my face in.‚Äù (Some guys like to put on a show)

‚ÄúYour car always smells good‚Äù (frequent passenger)

Could go on for days "

How did the upcoming WWIII go?
Does Donald Trump die from a common cold?
Funny thing. We were going to put the house on the market today. 
they sold me. people would come by the house or I would be sent to peoples houses to have sex with them. Star in child porn. Or be abused. The rule was that they never could hit me too hard though. Mostly because it would leave marks. 
"She knew that I was looking at rings, but she had no time frame of when or how I was planning to propose."

"I have a few close friends I made and confided in. One was my boyfriend for a summer in 8th grade, who at the time felt he was asexual. I later quietly ended the relationship, a mistake that still haunts me. We have begun to talk again. The other being my friend Skyler, whose family is very liberal and have been accepting of me from the beginning, taking me out and just letting me be myself. It's not a whole lot of fun, but what's life if you can't make the best out of bad situations, right?! I try to just live my life, reminding myself that one day, I'll be allowed to be me, and I won't have to be ashamed or hide from things I can't control. "

"A mix. Once we had a couple who only played with each other, but generally everyone plays with everyone."
My mom actually took me out of the business. Right after recording a lot of other people were wanting me but my mom didn't want me to end up like Amanda Bynes or Lindsey Lohan or anything... I developed a passion for yoga after getting a ten vertebrae spinal fusion. I saw how quickly it healed my body and mind and had to start teaching.

Did they kill themselves because they were going to get caught? 
I'm into some werid things. but I guarrentee its because of the abuse. I never told any of my partners I was abused. I did this ama because I am going to tell her what happened to me.  I screwed things up with her and I want to try and slavage it. 
"I mean it is unbelievable how nice you people are.  I know its just your job but I really appreciate it.  When I thank the woman at McDonalds I get a grunt

There are definitely a lot of people who call me Boo! Experience has landed well overall. Some weird things happened growing up like paparazzi coming to my kindergarten and random people being able to find me in my dorm at college but other than that it's been great! Probably hit me in elementary school when all the fifth graders wanted to be my friend as a first grader but no one elses.. haha
Yep! That's the plan. T minus 2 years! My GPA is a 3.65 and my SAT was a 1380. Trying my best to save up for an out of state school!

Meet John Goodman or Billy Crystal?
"It is pretty cool to play out your dream as the protagonist instead of as a viewer, last night I ran away from a comical Hitler and Mussolini who personally chased me through France after escaping a POW camp during WW2, but in the dreams that are based around real life it is fun to say things to people you know that you are too polite to say in reality, or to spend the night socialising with people and doing things you wouldn't usually do. It is also pretty good fun to just do nothing and chill with your thoughts and still wake up feeling well rested even though you've just spent maybe 45 minutes thinking about whatever you want to"
"No question here, but just take solace in the fact that despite it hurting really badly right now, if she wasn‚Äôt in it 100% she probably did you a favor in the long run. The universe is setting you up for someone better. Best wishes to you internet friend. "

"To be completely honest, trying to give someone instructions in a supermarket is surprisingly difficult especially if they're unfamiliar with the store. But sometimes it is funny to skip a word or two in a sentence and see if they notice ;) "

Someone who knew him then did say he adapted well to the school after a month and invited friends over to his house to play videogames. He loved basketball. And he was pretending to be the son of a chofer, no one knew he was Kim Jong-il's son."
Wait. So they would show up to just have sex in the presence of other people having sex? 
Why would you propose to an ON/OFF girlfriend?
Are you okay? :(
"I would have to take my boyfriend, I can never have a bad time with him. And of course he would protect me from Randal ;)"

Thanks .... I think ... Wait no edgey teen NO ITS NOT YOU DONT UNDERSTAND ME
"yes. But they did it in a loving way. ""meaning they were nice to me"" My mom would tell me that  I was worthless that  I deserved to die. But they said it in a gentle way. That I wasn't supposed to be here, that they were doing me a favor by abusing me and using me for money. That it gave me a purpose and a reason to be here."
Wait she was a potentially drunk allegedly pregnant 14 year old that was driving a car? What the fuck lol

"The best was when one dude answered the door wearing nothing but a bath robe and a German accent, with a riding crop.  He called into the house, ""Oh, everyone, ze pizza iss here!!"" and another spindly little fellow in cuffs and a ballgag came over to take them....

""Ah! Ssank you!"" said the first dude, as he swatted the gagged boy on his bottom as he took them.  He paid the pizza the pizza dude, who kept trying to see in at the massive titted brunette tied up just around the corner....     "
yes. But it took a long time. Im at the point now where people would never know this happened to me.

"I have luckily never had to shoot anyone. I was involved for an Officer Involved Shooting. The subject raised his fire arm and shot at the four of us on scene. One of our Officers was able to return fire and kill the subject. 

I have a ton of shocking things I've seen (Most I wish I could unsee). I was called for a report of a suicidal teenager. We went upstairs and attempted to talk with him. He said goodbye, he was sorry and thanked us for trying to help, and shot himself."
