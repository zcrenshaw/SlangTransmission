"Body positivity is saying ""a person's health shouldn't affect how you treat them, and nobody should have to feel like they're worthless because of the way they look."" Normalizing obesity is ""weight has absolutely nothing to do with general health and there's nothing wrong with being obese."""

"lol, I cringe when I think of my emo phase. My mam wouldn't even let me be a proper emo because I couldn't dye or straighten my hair. I was like emo lite. "
That Czech free-use video. Anyone who's seen it knows what I'm talking about. 
"First, it's important to keep in mind that compared to the general population, Reddit is comprised disproportionately of younger, introverted males. The anonymity of Reddit is also highly attractive to people who reasonably don't feel comfortable expressing their views in the public sphere -- e.g. Red Pillers, ""pick-up artists,"" men's rights activists, etc. People like this are overrepresented on this site for sure. 

It is considerably easier to find a casual sex partner as a woman than as an equally attractive man. I will admit that. But too many frustrated, empathy-challenged Redditors are tempted to play the victim instead of pausing to consider the logical reasons behind this. The stakes are higher for women, for one. We bear the majority of heavy consequences that can be involved with NSA sex. Obviously, we are the ones who get pregnant. The ramifications of most STDs also tend to be more severe for us and result in things like cervical cancer (HPV) or loss of fertility (gonorrhea, chlamydia). It's also highly frowned upon by society for women to be ""sluts"" who ""sleep around,"" but men tend to be praised for similar behavior. We need more of an incentive than men do for NSA sex (i.e. a more attractive or desirable partner) because there are simply more risks.

It's also worth noting that the rewards for NSA sex tend to be stronger for men than women. Why do people have sex? Well, there are a few main reasons at least for emotionally healthy people: expressing passion or love, feeling close to another person, and sexual release. The first two are generally not applicable with near- or complete strangers, so it comes down to the last one. Women are [half as likely](https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/well/2013/11/11/women-find-orgasms-elusive-in-hookups/?referer=http://www.thedatereport.com/dating/sex/women-twice-as-likely-to-orgasm-from-relationship-sex-than-one-night-stand/) to achieve orgasm from a one-night stand as men are. So, considering that we more than likely are better able to satisfy ourselves in the comfort of our own homes while avoiding the aforementioned risks, we need a much more compelling reason to have NSA sex. It adds up. And at least for Redditors, the buck seems to stop at hookup ""inequality."" 

Just being 100% candid here -- at the risk of sounding conceited, I am a young, thin, white, conventionally attractive woman. Having an endless supply of people who want to hump you like a blow-up doll and then ditch you is not a ""privilege."" I have had just as hard of a time finding compatible, willing long-term partners as anyone else -- it's taken years of trying, failing, and yes, getting rejected. Finding a healthy relationship isn't easy for anyone, because the strength of an emotional connection is mostly based on things that are not physical. The subtle nuances and differences between personalities are endless, and finding a good fit can be a lifelong endeavor. 

There's also a really big difference between someone liking *you* and liking the idea of fucking you. I've been rejected plenty of times by people who just didn't like *me* that much -- maybe not sexually, but definitely for the purpose of any kind of meaningful discourse -- often after the relationship had already turned sexual. Being objectified like this is a uniquely dehumanizing and awful feeling. And in the cases where people are willing to ignore that they don't actually like you because they like fucking you or they like the way you look -- is that any better? Am I supposed to be happy about this? If anything, I think it's harder for women to find meaningful relationships, because we have to spend so much time weeding out the people who just want to use us and bolt once they've gotten their notch. 

Edit: Oh my goodness! Gold! Was having kind of a rough day actually, and this really cheered me up! Thank you so much, whoever you are! "
"Doing things by myself. Like hiking, going to museums, going shopping, etc. I used to feel like I was on display when I was alone, but since I've lived in new cities where I didn't know anyone, I actually started to enjoy doing things on my own. It's still fun to do things with others though, but I wish I would've been more independent earlier on in life."
"My mom actually mentioned this in her speech at my wedding lol. The story TLDR was that I, a very extroverted preschooler, once told her very seriously that I would NEVER leave her like my older siblings. She, the introvert, was internally terrified at the idea. 

Anyway as a kid I remember her saying things like ""everyone has to learn to play by themselves"" and ""it's time for me to read the newspaper while you play"". I think it was still hard on her, but I think sometimes she just approached it as if it was part of our daily schedule and part of my job as a kid. I imagine it's much harder when they are the age that needs constant supervision, but I think some kids can be trained to play alone in front of you. "
Napping as an almost daily event. I even got my SO into it.
"My ex never leaked anything, but I have a similar situation. My freshmen year of college I did a cam session to save up money for the next semester and I made a shit ton of money without hardly doing anything. l basically stripped and chatted on webcam. Anyways I had no idea people would record it and put it literally everywhere (stupid of me, I know). Once one person stumbled upon the video, it spread like wildfire. The person who spread it all throughout my hometown happened to be an old close friend of mine and the man I went to prom with. I was so shocked he would do something like that. My hometown has about 4,000 people and the university I go to that's about 2 hours away has 4,000 students. EVERYONE found out.


I remember I went on yak one day and the top yak was ""damn, that redhead really knows how to get it"". I went on into the comments and my stomach sank. They were talking about me. I get chills just thinking about my initial reaction. I have never felt so sick in my life and I couldn't believe that it was actually about me. I had a boyfriend at the time the yak was made and I just drove really far away and sent him a text saying I needed to talk to him, but he had already seen the yak. He was so angry at me. The next few days consisted of me not eating at all, having a constant pit in my stomach, and feeling super anxious whenever I went anywhere. I struggled walking to class or even eating in the cafeteria. But I still did it and I acted like I was ok. Men would harass me. Take pictures of me. Yell out the name I used for the webcam session... it was hell. This is something that completely altered my life and it still has a major impact on me a year later. I thought going home I would be able to escape, but I didn't realize everyone here knew about it too. 


I used to be the nice, quiet, smart, innocent girl. Now I am the girl who did the cam session. How men treated me after they found out about it has forever altered how I view the world and how I cope with things. "
All of my tattoos :( I don't HATE them I just don't love them and I wish I would have waited instead of covering a huge portion of my body at 18 years old.

"""You know, everything happens for a reason!"" Cut the fatalistic bullshit, Nancy, my dog just died. "
The amount of premarital sex I have. Teenage me was a super diehard Bible thumping evangelical Christian. Years of sexual repression really take a toll on ya lol...
"We let a friend crash on our sofa for two days. Two days quickly turned into one week. He never even thanked us for letting him stay. He got coked out of his gourd one day when the rest of us are straight-edged and not OK with drug usage. He then wrote shitty ""deep"" poetry while off his tits and then proceeded to try to read it to us at 2 am when we were all trying to sleep. Eventually my (normally chill) housemate physically threw him out of our house. He then proceeded to tell everyone we knew how ""mean"" we were.

He is not our friend anymore."
"""How's the job search going?"" It took me a really long time and I always hated it when people asked. "
"My alternative/""cool girl"" phase. Like, I'm so different and therefore better than all of the ""basic"" girls (not that anyone was using that phrase back then). I have more thoughts and feelings than anyone else, no one gets me, I'm totally gonna do something *alternative* with my life and that makes me *better*. 

Yeah, no. I come across people who still have this attitude as adults and I just find it so childish. At least I was just an obnoxious teenager who grew out of it. "
"This one?

"My mother had ""Captain's Hour"" when my siblings and I were small. Basically, it was a time we were not allowed to enter the living room for an hour, usually 7-8 pm (right after dinner). Knowing the time was a regular thing helped us as little kids because we knew when the clock hit 8:01 we could go and bother her, though usually we were so engrossed in play by then she would have more time to herself."
Shopping at Aldi. I used to think it was a crappy store but I was super wrong and I've been saving SO much money since I've started doing most of my grocery shopping there!
"We'd only been together for about three months and we had Friday night plans he'd been looking forward to all week, but I had to cancel on him last minute because my little sister was diagnosed with leukemia.

I was a complete wreck. My sister came over to talk to me and my parents about it and we all had a good cry. When she eventually left to go be with her friends, he let me know he'd skipped out on our plans altogether and I was more than welcome to come over to be cuddled and comforted if I felt up for it, but he'd understand if I needed some time.  

When I got to his house, he'd made a cuddle nest of my favorite pillows and blankets in his bed, queued up my favorite episode of my favorite show, loaded a bowl, and bought me a veritable zoo of gummy animals and a case of my favorite beer. When I saw it I immediately broke down all over again and he just held and pet me while I snot-cried all over him, and continued to do so on and off all night and the rest of the weekend.  

Very, VERY luckily, after like three months of getting second, third, and fourth opinions, it turned out my sister had been misdiagnosed, but I will always and forever look back on that experience and feel stupid grateful to have such an amazingly supportive and kind partner that I know I can count on to be there for me when I need it the most."
"The idea of being used as an object is very appealing. It just isn't for you, and that's fine too. "
"I am a very introverted mom with a very very extroverted son. Basically I've learned to grab quiet time in weird places. If I'm having a particularly rough day and just need peace, I'll take him to the park or McDonald's play place. I get tea and sit with a book while he plays (he's 4). I still supervise him but I usually get some time to read.

One thing I do despite it making me tired is to always take time for me after he goes to bed. Once he's asleep I desperately need time without being touched or talked to. So that's when I stay up and watch a movie or get stuff done. I'm a single mom which actually helps in this case!"
Wearing leggings. I don't think I can ever go back to jeans. 
"My dad is pretty much housebound. I was at the hospital taking my mom off life support, and my husband realized that no one was with my dad (my dad also knew he couldn't take being there when my mom died: personal decision I completely respect). 

My husband packed up our little one, went over there and watched movies with my dad for the day. I hadn't even asked him.

As long as I live, I will never forget that.

"
"A long, long time friend of mine tearfully solicited our friend group for donations because she is behind on her bills and things had been dire for a long time. She's had financial troubles basically since we became adults six years ago, largely because of irresponsible spending, but had never asked me for money before. I gave her money, and also asked her if I could give her some financial advice. She declined the advice, saying she had a plan going forward to turn things around, she just needed to get back on her feet. 

Three weeks later she posted ""just got paid!"" with a picture of a $400 tattoo. 

Many sighs."
I thought I was definitely for sure straight and that my feelings about girls were just a phase. As it turns out I was having a straight phase.
That I have a partner. Teenage me was convinced I was going to die a virgin.
"It happened when I was 15. Made my life hell at school, people still tell me that they've seen the pictures. I coped with it by cutting a lot of people out of my life and just tying to pretend it never happened "
"
I haven't been with current SO for long. Going on three months. But damn if he isn't the best thing to walk into my life. 

On our very first date/first time actually meeting (yeah, I found him on Tinder), we were at a bar getting drinks when I got repeated phone calls from a friend of mine. I'm of the mantra that you never answer your phone on a date, but this person never actually calls me and they wouldn't stop, so I apologized and answered. Just as I picked up the phone, a news break came on the TV at the bar we were at. Turns out two of my best friends were in a horrid car accident earlier that day and killed someone and were pretty mangled as well, one of them was thrown in jail and charged with vehicular manslaughter and all this other stuff.

I feel like anyone else who was on a first date would have excused themselves in that moment because what do you say to someone who has that come up?

No, he stayed. Let me cry it out, held my hand, let me freak out and didn't judge me at all for it. He walked me home, made sure I was okay and came over the very next night with dinner and a movie and sat with me to make sure I wasn't alone.

If that's not the definition of an amazing and selfless human, I don't know what is."
"Me: oh, yeah. That feels good. Right there. Just like that. 

Him: * changes whatever he's doing *

Why???"
Getting professional massages. It's worked wonders for my back and shoulder pain. I could have saved myself so much misery if I'd made an appointment sooner!
"I think it's a really complex issue that is very rarely discussed well, especially on Reddit.  Good luck."
"Reposting my comment from your previous post:

I think it's because of the demographics of reddit. A lot of younger (but often older as well), nerdier, more introverted type men congregate to this website and I think they often have more trouble with dating. They of course still want the kind of women that everybody's lusting after - young, beautiful, thin, usually white or asian, very conventionally attractive...basically, the kind of women who are in demand by society as a whole and the kind of women who are probably less likely to have trouble finding men who are interested in them (and that's not saying that they never get turned down, or never have difficulty dating). I am sure they regularly ignore average looking or unattractive women on a regular basis and they could probably more easily find relationships if they looked for women who are not held up as the pinnacle of beauty.

Also, IMO a lot of people here have whacked out standards. I've seen people calling beautiful celebrities ""average looking"" or even ""unattractive"". I get that beauty is in the eye of the beholder but how in the world is Jennifer Lawrence average looking or unattractive...

Any woman who has ever been the average to below average friend in a group of beautiful women knows that you will routinely be ignored in favor of the prettier ones and that you don't have an ""easier"" time getting into a relationship. "
"That I'm alive. 

Teenage me couldn't picture being an adult at all. I didn't have many (any?) people like me to look up to. Teenage me never really expected to make it because people like me never did. "
"I'm the opposite. Usually my default is no, having had a lot of social anxiety problems growing up, but lately I've been forcing myself to say ""yes"" more often because generally speaking I regret going out less than I regret sitting around kinda wishing I was doing something. But to each their own FOR SURE!"
Nothing wrong with good old-fashioned ketchup. Garlic aioli if I want to get all fancy.
"People are so awful. &gt;:{ They pay you in private, then turn around and shame you in public."
"People from high school saw, people from college saw, my neighbors saw, my parents saw. I remember my dad saying he wanted to move out because he didn't want to be known as the family with the town whore. 

That, among other stuff, has led to severe depression that I have trouble coping with to this day. I've become so fucking paranoid that I don't know who's my real friend and who might be plotting something against me, or who might so much as know something they can use against me. I've cut out A LOT of people in response. Have almost no friends now. Sometimes I don't even know when I'm being irrational, but I'm too scared not to be hypervigilant.

"My emo/fangirl phase in the early to mid 2000s where I was obsessed with The Used, My Chemical Romance, Underoath, etc. I wore only jeans and band shirts and skate shoes. My statuses on social media and AIM were Taking Back Sunday lyrics and the only eye shadow I wore was black. It lasted for about 5 years and then I slowly got out of it when I got to college."
Learned the hard way. Had my trust and heart broken multiple times - that really changes you. I stopped caring what people will think if I say no. People haven't been good to me.
Congrats
"A close friend of mine was getting married and both of her parents had passed. The grooms family did not have much money so the couple needed pay for about 95% of it on their own. He's a school teacher and she's an office manager living in a high rent city, which means they don't have expendable income either. I have a lot of hotel points and used every last one of them to book them a huge suite at a super fancy hotel in our city. It served as both the reception location and of course they got to stay in the hotel on their wedding night. 

Cut to a few days.. checked my credit card statement and there was over a thousand in charges from the hotel from food and beverage. Because it was all under my name, I had to check in with my card. 

Cut to one month.. they filed for divorce. 

I'm out over a grand and years of hotel points gone. "
Pizza. I didn't have it until I was 34. 
"What helped me enormously was reading Miss Manners.  She reiterated many times that saying no is perfectly polite and well within the bounds of etiquette, and it's further pressing someone who has already said no that's rude."

"""You have to love yourself completely before anyone else can."" 

Don't get me wrong, this has a lot of truth in it and I think people need listen to it. But it just wasn't true for me. When I met my boyfriend I was in a pretty low place. I didn't even like myself, let alone love myself. Over time he made me realize how much I was worth. It wasn't until I saw myself from his eyes that I truly loved myself. It wasn't like he was my ""savior,"" it took a lot of hard work on my part to get to that place. But if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have even made the effort "

"I went through a cowboy phase that I thought was life. Went to rodeos all the time. Wore starched jeans and pearl snap shirts. Drove a truck. All my friends were farmers or rodeo people. We only went to western bars and I listened to mostly country music. 

My sister asked me if I was going to stop wearing cowboy clothes when things started getting serious with my boyfriend/future husband (he was def not country) and I gave her an incredulous NO. 

When I graduated from college I couldn't afford the clothes anymore and then got married had kids and really couldn't afford them or going out to cowboy bars. My best friend at the time decided she hated my husband for no apparent reason and we cut ties. All of our ""friends"" went with her because I wasn't really country. I witnessed too many serious injuries and animal deaths at rodeos and stopped finding them fun at all. I got more worried about the environment and started finding big trucks and rolling coal incredibly annoying. I still love classic country but you can't pay me to listen to any of that other crap. 

We are living in rural Texas now which the old me would have loved. I just find it all incredibly annoying and can't wait for the kids to graduate so we can move to the city. I have one pair of cowboy jeans and boots for all the stupid denim and diamond events they do here. Spending money on them was painful. 

I'm more hippie than anything anymore. "

This right the fuck here. It's suuuch a privilege to get constantly solicited for sex and then treated like I don't exist after the sex. Isn't it every girls to be used for her body and denied intimacy at the same time?
"When I was in high school, I let my friend borrow my bike to ride home because her mom had called and she had to get back fast.  She said she'd bring it to school the next day.  I didn't see her again for six years.  She said her uncle scrapped my bike for parts and she switched schools (for a totally unrelated reason).  I bought that bike with Christmas money my grandpa gave me and had only had it for a couple months."
"Growing up I was really in love with wolves, like I had a ton of wolf books (fiction and non-fiction) and wolf knick knacks all over my room. I wanted to go to college to study zoology and wildlife conservation so that I could work with wolves. Well, when I got to college I realized I was shit at chemistry and biology. It kind of killed my dream, and now while I still like wolves I am nowhere near as in love with them as I was. Now I am more of a dog lady."
Being quiet.
How does this happen? Are you from somewhere that didn't eat pizza? Were your parents anti-pizza? Were you just too stubborn to try? So many questions!?

"Victim of revenge porn here. This happened, damn, almost 4 years ago. He had taken pictures that I had saved on my phone and sent them to himself without my knowledge. A couple weeks later I had respectfully told him that I didn't want to date him anymore (we never established a relationship) and he didn't take it too well. Two days later a guy friend of mine found my pics online and had called me. Only one pic showed my face and I was fully covered in it. He sent me the link and I had him flag me to the mods of that website as me being underage and they were taken down moments later. I immediately had called the guy and asked if he did it. He denied it at first, I threatened to go the cops and that's when he confessed. But he confessed only to taking my pictures. He claimed that he was distraught the day I ended things and went to a friends house to vent. He brought his laptop there that had my pictures saved in a folder on his desktop and left the room and ""his friends were the ones who put them online."" I felt so sick to my stomach and felt very betrayed. I ended up going to the cops, only to be slut shamed. Not a day goes by that I don't think that these pics will resurface one day. "
"Being moody while traveling. 

I've been on vacations with a few moody people before - partners, friends, family - who would complain and snap all day because we had to walk twenty minutes with our bags, or would withdraw and not talk because it was too hot. 

If you're moody and irritable at home, I can go do my own thing and give you space. But when we're on vacation, well, we came here *together* and I don't know anyone else here. There are also people who are super easy going at home in their comfort zone, but when they travel they are incredibly high strung and flip out at the smallest inconveniences. It makes me feel super isolated and alone, and I *hate* the feeling of wandering a few paces behind someone who is too irritable to enjoy anything when we're in a fantastic new place and there's so much I want to get excited about but all I can do is watch the sidewalk go by. I'd much rather not travel with someone like that. But if we're going to be partners, I'd want to be able to travel with them. 

So if I want to get serious with someone, I need to take them on a trip. If even for just a weekend. "
Wait until you switch to cups. That's where it's at.
"I think the men who say this are defining ""women"" as ""women I want to date.""  And they might also be defining ""can easily find"" as ""I, personally, know right where it is.""

So when they say ""Women can easily find a boyfriend"", they're really saying ""I know exactly where to find a guy who is willing to date the women I want to date!"""

Right before I was wheeled away, my SO kissed me. It felt like the physical manifestation of him telling me ""I love you, I'm worried, I hope you'll be okay and I'll see you so soon.""

Anyway, I almost died in theatre and looking back, that kiss is so special to me because it could have been the last kiss I ever got if I had died. "
"I got an Aerosmith tattoo right on my wrist when I turned 18. So visible and so stupid 😂 8 years later and no longer a massive obsessive fan of Aerosmith, I've learned to accept it as a token of the 10 years growing up that I wanted to bone a 70 year old man. "

"- I got super stupid sick shortly after we started dating. He showed up at my apartment with groceries and banished me to the couch to make me soup. 

- When we had to put my dog down, I didn't have time to call him at work. I went to his workplace at the end of his shift, where he and some friends let me cry it out and got me all the wine I wanted. The next day, he had desserts delivered to my apartment. 

- The other night, I went to bed early. Woke up to an empty bed, which is weird. But he left a lightning bug in a jar next to me so I'd wake up to something happy. We let the little dude outside after saying hello. 

- He's reviewing last night's class and practice material with me today, since I had to sit out last night because a food handler didn't believe in lactose intolerance. 

- Has scheduled the same day off every week so we can go to practice together. I found this out last night and swooned a little.

"Polyamory. I thought I was ""polyamorous"" for years. I had a close friend who was into it (this guy was one of his girlfriend's five partners), and he encouraged me to give it a shot. I got pretty gung-ho about the lifestyle and did a lot of research that confirmed my point of view. There's a lot of theories to back up polyamory and I ate that shit up. I was one of those idiots that thought that everyone should be polyamorous, and people were just brainwashed by religious morals. I used polyamory as an excuse for why I did the things I did when I was younger, and why I wanted to date more than one person. ""It's just who I am!""

I had my fun with a few non-exclusive relationships but I don't think that lifestyle aligns with who I truly am as a person. I think I wanted to experience dating different people because I was young, and romantic attention has always been a priority to me. I think I was also deeply (and rightfully) dissatisfied with my situation, and had been for a long time, but didn't want to really pursue the end of my very first big girl relationship. In fact, the guy who encouraged me to pursue polyamory suggested that as a possibility early on. I should've listened to the people who knew me and my situation better than my naive, rose-tinted view could really allow me to see.

At the end of the day, and this is something I learned at university since I study wildlife -- people point a lot to apes such as chimps to speculate what's most ""natural"" for humans. Chimps are a lot like people in their relationship patterns. There's every combination imaginable. Sometimes it's many males with one female, or many females with one male, and all sorts of variations thereof -- but a lot of chimps do actually prefer to be monogamous. I think it's better not to dictate other people's choices and just live your life the way you want to live it. There is no perfect human relationship style. We make our own choices."

"Self-hatred. I thought that my whole life would just be endless self-loathing and misery and fatigue.

"You're confusing the politics of equality with sexual fetishism. 

A woman can completely say, ""Hey, you need to treat me like a person, not an object"" in *every* situation and still elect to go to a sex party where they strip naked and are freeused by every person at the party. 

Sexual fetishes are often contradictory. Women don't generally want to be raped in real life, and yet rape fantasy for women is a thing.

"&gt; Also, IMO a lot of people here have whacked out standards. I've seen people calling beautiful celebrities ""average looking"" or even ""unattractive"". I get that beauty is in the eye of the beholder but how in the world is Jennifer Lawrence average looking or unattractive...

Hahahahah I've seen guys on here say they ""deserve"" a hot woman who waits on him and then turn around and paint a woman who wants a guy who is kind and she is attracted to as a ""delusional, entitled who should lower her standards"". The double standards are astounding.

EDIT: I also find it curious when I see guys say things like, ""I will say yes to any girl that is nice, not fat, and somewhat ok looking...we just want someone to love us."" This is great and all but irl, I have seen guys turn down sweet girls that look perfectly fine in the hopes that they will snag some VS-model look-alike in the future (and when they do find her, they inevitably get rejected). I mean, it's fine to have standards and all, but expect the people you approach to have standards as well. But eh, I guess I'm just getting too ""ranty"" atm."

"I first have to say that I didn't necessarily regret this.. it was just really messed up.

A few years ago I was eating at a burger place in front of my university. It was lunch time so it was extremely packed to the point there were no seats available inside. When I walk out with my food to sit in the patio, a young teenage guy comes up to me and asks me for money. He tells me he has a wife and two kids and they don't have a place to go and need money to get a hotel and buy some food. He then points to his wife, she was sitting with a new born in her arms and a toddler sitting next to her. I gave them the change I had left from my meal (about a $1.50 or $2) and sat on one of the tables next to them. I felt horrible eating next to them. 

Before I started eating, a man in a suit gets off his Mercedes and makes his way to the door. The young guy asks him for money. He tells him he only has a card and no cash but is willing to buy them all their own meal. The guy then tells him they all ate already. The man then tells him, ""wait right here! Let me go to the bank and get you some money."" The man leaves and comes back in less than 10 minutes. He then hands the guy a bill. The man walks inside the restaurant and goes on with his day. Then I hear the guy's wife ask.. ""how much did he give you?"" The guy then says, ""the fucker only gave us $20!"" Then they both proceed to laugh and say he should have given them more.

I was so angry and in disbelief that I just grabbed my food and left. I could not believe that they were so ungrateful that this man went out of his way to give them money. He didn't have to do that. I don't regret giving them money, I did it cause of the baby and the toddler but I can't help but wonder what ever happened to those kids. "

"I paid for a condo on the beach for my best friend, her husband, and her two adult brother in-laws... it was my first major vacation as a 24 year old adult without my actual family being there. Really proud of being able to save money and time off for this vacation.

They're always ""tight"" on money but they ALWAYS go and spend it on the next big Xbox game or will even drop money for the newest gaming console... anyways they promised me that they would save enough money (booked in February for July) in those months leading up to it so we could eat out at amazing seafood places and go parasailing etc. it was going to be our awesome adult vacation.

Night before we leave they withdraw 800 from their banking account (I was there and saw the amount). Cool. I'm thinking we're going to have fun on this trip. Nope. When we arrive and start planning out the next few days, they exclaim it has to be dirt cheap because they don't have the money for it. I confront them and they give me some bullshit excuse about how they had to pay bills with that money but went on a gaming shopping spree the afternoon we left (found that out later when we arrived). They literally didn't have that 800 they withdrew in a 24 hour time period.

I asked them why even come on this trip if you want nothing but pizza and to sleep until 4p and then hit the beach. It was awful and they guilt tripped me out of doing activities because they didn't have the money for it (and I for sure wasn't going to pay for them). Ended up doing my own thing half the time and we all left a day early. We didn't talk for a good 6 months cause I was pissed. Never again will I spend a dime on them again."

"Used to be a server/manager. Had a young girl (maybe 15?) come in a few times a week, she only ever ordered a coffee and would sit in the back room doing homework. This went on for about a month, and we'd talk if I didn't have any other customers. Found out that her mom was pretty fucked up on drugs and men, and the only time this girl got quietness was after school coming into the restaurant. My first fuck up was that I stopped charging her for coffee (owner was ok with it.)

Well. She comes in one day and is telling me how awful her house is, how her mom won't buy any cleaning supplies, and she can't afford them, doesn't know what to do cause her mom won't even buy laundry detergent. 

I mean, look, I'm used to the scams about food or clothing. Or phone bills and gas. I've never had a teenager be upset because they don't own a mop and Fabuloso. I had the next day off and told her I'd take her to the dollar store to get the basics. She gets $12 worth of stuff. No big deal. 

Head to Wal-Mart for the mop and stuff. She gets one of the more expensive ones but I figure whatever. Gets a bucket. Then she gets the giant thing of Tide. At the end, she accumulated like $150 worth of cleaning shit, paper towels, paper plates, toilet paper, trash bags, etc. 

Anyway, we check out. Already have a bad feeling about it, but then she snatches the receipt out of the cashiers hand. I ask for it when we get to the car, and she says she wants it so she knows how much she owes me when she gets a job.. Ummmk, no, you owe me $162. Then she says she must have dropped it. Fine. I'm never going to see that money back and that's fine because I knew that going in. 

Later that night, I guess she forgot I was still her friend on Facebook, because she posted a status wanting a friend to take her to Wal-Mart to return something. I commented and asked why she didn't return it when we were there earlier, knowing full well what she was doing. She blocked me, but not before her mom messaged me on Facebook to ask what sob story she gave me. She PayPal'd me the money back.  "

"I just want to say thanks for even asking this question because it's reminding me that other moms are in the same boat as me. 

My boyfriend and family are mostly extroverts so I have a hard time not feeling guilty when I freak out and need space sometimes. My boyfriend likes to go out and adventure with our daughter when he can which is great because it gives me some time alone every once in a while. But honestly, it's not enough for me to feel 100% okay. The kid is 3 now and she's in this super clingy stage, at least with me, and I can't figure out a way to get her to be able to play by herself (it's especially hard in our small apartment). 

I think the main thing is accepting that it's good for your kid that you to take time for yourself when you can. And to let people help when they offer. That part was hard for me at first because of the whole guilt thing. "
"It's almost like women have as much variation in their sexual interests as men!

This comment is like looking at a foot fetish video and asking ""but I thought that men were more interested in tits and asses than feet?""

Also there are heaps of ways you can have a sexual fantasy which totally goes against your actual wants in reality. You might be turned on by the thought of a sexy doctor scenario but *at the same time* think it totally inappropriate and disgusting for a doctor to try and have sex with their patients in real life. Rape/exploitation fantasies are common but it doesn't mean the person actually wants to be raped/exploited outside very narrow situations."

"I've had the fun experience of watching my field (neuroscience) go from being considered ""hard STEM"" to ""soft STEM"" or even ""not *really* STEM"" according to some...by sheer and utter coincidence this trend has precisely mirrored the demographic shift that has taken place over the same time period, from neuroscience being very heavily male-dominated to slightly female-dominated among the ranks grad students and post-docs.

You can already see a lot of people starting to regard biological sciences as a whole in this way, especially biomedical specialties.  Hell, in some countries women are the majority of medical doctors and it *just so happens* that in those countries being a doctor is a low-paying low-status position.  

So that's the thing to know about STEM as a woman, I think: Everyone mostly knows about the endemic sexism already, but a lot of people don't realize that if women buckle down and work twice as hard for half the credit and finally succeed in breaking down those barriers...then their entire field will be considered covered in girl cooties and will suddenly command less respect and lower pay."
"I think we all have ""types"" when it comes to physical appearance, which is totally fine. People can date who they want.

My problem is when people make absolute statements like, ""I'm just not attracted to [insert race here] people..."" or worse, ""[Insert race here] men/women are so unattractive!"" I mean there is no way the person saying that has met every single person of that race to be able to say that. 

Even more, I have seen people on Reddit *compare* ""racial preferences"" to sexual preference. I'm sorry but I just don't think you can compare racial preferences to something so biologically ingrained like sexual orientation (and in a way making such a comparison sort of belittles the natural complexities of sexual orientation, esp. since sex *isn't* a social construct the way race is). Because unlike sexual orientation, a lot of our racial preferences come from cultural biases, and can *definitely* change if a person with stringent ""racial preferences"" would just really try to think about the factors that led to these biases.

And yes, *exclusionary* racial preferences in the end of the day are biases, because the person saying they would never date someone of a certain race are basically generalizing *every single person* of that racial group to have a certain physical (or even behavioral) trait, which is pretty much prejudice and stereotyping.

EDIT: I see a lot of people saying that racial preferences aren't harmful. However, this type of ""brushing off"" only helps to perpetuate and continue the narrow standards of attractiveness in western society. And we all know that attractiveness not only impacts your romantic opportunities, but also your friendship opportunities, self-esteem, and even employment opportunities (so it's a rather large chain effect). I am just trying to say that it wouldn't be bad if we all sat back and thought about why we like what we like, and try to keep a more open mind."

I was going to talk to him about how I was feeling, but I finally realized that even if he agreed to make more effort, I don't want to be with someone that needs to be reminded to call/text/make plans once in a while. If someone is right for you, they'll want to see you and talk to you."
"I was feeling really anxious about our future one night and getting really concerned that I was holding my SO back. After graduating, my SO had 3 job offers and we were discussing which one he should take. The highest paid one was in an industry I find deeply unethical (oil and gas...) as well as being in a part of the country I really didn't want to move to. We had spent a month there when he was interning and I just hated living in that city. The second highest paid was in software development which my SO loves, the pay was still super good and it was in a really beautiful city. The lowest one wasn't really a consideration. 

Anyway he took the second highest paying job. Shortly after we moved, he mentioned to a friend that he probably would have taken that first job if it wasn't for me. It was only a throwaway comment but I got really concerned that he was resenting me, that I ruined his career prospects etc. I brought this up to him and he goes,

""Let me be clear. There's no job in the world that I would choose over you. That's because I don't think it would matter what I did because as long as you're with me, I'll be happy.""

He went on to say how glad he was that we decided on the job he's in now because he's much happier in this industry and we like living here. He clarified that when he said that to his friend, he wasn't expressing regret over his decision but more gratitude to me for making him consider more than just the salary. 

It turned out to be a great move for me as well as I also quit my job to move and ended up going into my dream industry and am loving it."
"Had my heart and trust broken for the last time. It actually only happened about just over a month ago, but it broke me in a way I just was not at all expecting. I felt absolutely awful about myself and life for about 2 weeks before I decided it felt so utterly shit that I needed to make some big changes.

I said no to three guys (long standing FWBs who I see infrequently often with big gaps inbetween) and told them each that I couldn't see them anymore and why. 

I told one of my best friends that I didn't like the disrespectful way he talked about his girlfriend and to not talk about her like that to me, because he just reminds me of all the assholes who have hurt me. He has messaged me constantly every single day since the day we met (almost a year ago), but he stopped contacting me after that and I had no intention to contact him first. He ended up contacting me yesterday and he asked to see me and I said no and that I'm not ready yet.

My other best friend has a habit of ""consoling"" me by suggesting everything she thinks I've been doing wrong when it comes to men. I usually just nod along and feel absolutely crushed inside. Last time she made a comment I finally said, ""No, I don't think I've done anything wrong. I treat people very well and nothing I've done was an invitation to be taken advantage of, mistreated or lied to.""

At Hockey another player kept elbowing me and shoving me the whole first half. I ALWAYS just take that shit and say nothing. This time, after I won a tackle against her and she started to take her 5 metres, I said loudly and sternly, ""You need to watch your elbows!"" I know it doesn't sound like much, but I've never done it before and she immediately apologised.

"&gt; we should be encouraging healthy eating habits and exercise no matter what.

We could easily look at this kind of thing as a form of self-love and body positivity in the more internal sense. Like, ""I try to eat well and exercise *because* I love my body and want to do good things for it."" It doesn't have to be ""You shouldn't love your body because your overweight/obese.""

I do agree with your sentiment about ultimately not telling other people what to do with their bodies. Crap like that is almost always just concern-trolling."
"When I was around 15 I was completely convinced that I would be wearing denim mini-shorts for the rest of my life. As in, I genuinely believed that I'd be wearing them into my 70s, and not just in a 'hadn't really thought about it' way; I had specifically pictured it and decided that it'd look great. 

Turns out I was mostly done with denim mini-shorts by the time I was 21. Because you know, your sense of style at 15 isn't usually timeless. "

I was young and naïve at the time so I didn't know how to deal with it but obviously now I realise a) I was underage so the photos were illegal, b) my boss is a POS (well I knew that anyway), c) I should never have been shamed into not going to HR"

"If you have to ask, that's usually your answer, especially at the beginning.

"I'm going to start this off by saying that this is just my own view/opinion, and I do not expect others to think the same.

I feel like body positivity is a great tool for people with any kind of body image issues.  For example, I'm heavier than I would like to be and my weight has yoyo-ed a bit over the past 10 years.  But whenever I start to get really negative about my looks/figure, I start reminding myself of the things I CAN do, like ""Hey, you can take a 3-4 mile walk and feel fine!"" or ""Remember when you went to Disneyland last month?  You walked almost 9 miles that day and you still felt alright the next morning!""  I remind myself to be grateful for the things my body can do and the level of health that I have, and in turn that reminds me to treat myself better by eating healthier, working out, etc.

Meanwhile, fat acceptance seems like it's trying to put a mask on the issue, or it's like a little kid who thinks that if they hide their face no one will see them.  I've heard people say things like ""Well Marilyn Monroe was a size 14 and she's considered the standard for what a woman's figure should be!"" completely ignoring that Marilyn's size 14 was on par with our size 6.  It's saying ""No, I'm healthy, I'm just fine!"" without acknowledging that there is a high risk of healthy problems, joint damage, etc caused by being overweight.  ""The average woman in the US wears a size 14/16!"" yes, because the average woman in the US is overweight.

I feel like in any issue involving weight, there's a very fine line between healthy and unhealthy.  It goes both ways, with people who are underweight or overweight."

"If I think about it, it reminds me of a poem by W. H. Auden:


Looking up at the stars, I know quite well

That, for all they care, I can go to hell,

But on earth indifference is the least

We have to dread from man or beast.


How should we like it were stars to burn

With a passion for us we could not return?

**If equal affection cannot be,**

**Let the more loving one be me.**


Admirer as I think I am

Of stars that do not give a damn,

I cannot, now I see them, say

I missed one terribly all day.


Were all stars to disappear or die,

I should learn to look at an empty sky

And feel its total dark sublime,

Though this might take me a little time."
"My first kiss with my SO of 6 years was pretty epic. We were dancing to soul/funk music at a bar and he was twirling me around and kind of swing dance style dancing with me. We had a couple of moments where he leaned in close but didn't kiss me yet, letting the tension build, and finally he spun me and pressed me up against a pole. He lightly kissed my neck first and then landed a deep, slow kiss on my lips. Followed by leaving the bar and making out in the streets of New York and a sexless sleepover. "

"She's still a friend, I just won't give her money again. I've given her gifts in the past that were worth more than what I gave her this time ($100), so I just thought of it in terms of that. I honestly went into it expecting her to do something short sighted and dumb, but hoping she could do better. I absolutely believe that she really was in a bad place and desperately needed help when she asked. She just has no concept of long term thinking, and I'm sure her thinking really went ""I just got paid and my immediate needs are covered, huzzah extra money I will do something fun impulsively!"" With no thought to the fact that her paycheck doesn't cover her needs and that's why she is always broke. She's not malicious or intentionally taking advantage, and she grew up in the most fucked up household I've ever seen and as a result just... lacks... certain modes of thinking. Usually she's the only one who suffers as a result of her terrible decision making, and this was the first and only (it's been over a year) time she's ever asked for help, so I haven't cut her out of my life. I wasn't mad, just disappointed. "
"I went into a Game shop about eight years ago to buy a gift for my current SO. The guys behind the counter were freinds of my ex- my first real boyfriend, but as the break up was amicable, everyone stayed on good terms. 


They were being overtly flirty that day, and when I asked them what was going on (I thought it was a prank) they revealed that my ex had taken photos of me during my first sexual experiences and distributed them to all his freinds. 


It had started months after we broke up, and nearly everyone we had mutually known had seen me in unflattering positions. I had never known he'd taken them, and was horrified, at 19, to realise I was basically the local porn star. 


So I cut each and every person who admitted to seeing the pictures and not telling me out of my life. Numbers blocked, Facebook blocked, just cut them right out. Anyone who knew but didn't admit it was also cut off. My ex got sent a single text to let him know I understand he was clearly frustrated that I had moved on, I pitied him and I cut him off too.


I later wished I'd sent an email to the manager of the store to let them know a number of their staff were sharing inappropriate pictures of a customer without her consent and then *flirting with me* about it. I wished I'd come back and told them all about his tiny cock. But I didn't. I heard through the grapevine that several of them have since lead shitty lives, but honestly I don't care. I just wanted them to stop, and I knew they wouldn't, so I stepped away and pretended it didn't happen. I don't know if my SO ever heard about it."

"I believe most straight people do not completely respect my sexuality. And I'd say about 90% of the straight people I know do not respect my relationship as much as they do straight relationships. 

Something regarding this just happened to me recently so I have a lot of feelings about this. I've been in a same sex relationship for about 3.5 years. I've been having sex with my girlfriend for 3 years. And recently, a straight friend of mine just started having sex. She tells me a story about her most recent encounter and it sounds like she wasn't that into the PIV sex. I ask her if she and the guy did some foreplay before. Instead of answering ""yes"" or ""no,"" she begins to explain to me how foreplay works. At first, I was just pretty confused. I know how to have foreplay, I've been doing it for 3 years (and before that, I had a few sexual encounters with a boyfriend). And then, she just launches into an explanation of how it feels to be penetrated.

So I ask her, ""You do know I've had sex before? Like a lot?"" And she goes, ""haha...yeah I guess, but, *penetration* is a lot different."" I respond, ""Dildos exist."" And she says, ""Oh yeah...""

Upon reflection I realized that she does not see sex between two women as real sex. She downplayed my relationship so much that she just made this unconscious assumption that I wouldn't know what foreplay was like or how penetration felt. 

People often do not recognize female same sex relationships as real in many ways, not just sexually. When I introduce my girlfriend as ""my girlfriend"" and act affectionate with her, we still have people assume that we are friends. My parents sometimes (supposedly absentmindedly) introduce us as friends, even though I correct them. When I dated a boy, all of my relatives were excited to meet him and teased me for having a boyfriend. When I started dating a girl, none of my relatives congratulated me or even recognized the relationship. Some relatives even confronted my younger sister (age 13) to give her their sympathies/condolences since she now had a ""gay sister"" (I'm bisexual, for the record). I also had one person tell me straight up that two women can't have ""real sex."" *darn*

Tl;dr: my relationship and sex life lacks legitimacy in society and to straight people.

I also have the weirdest luck of going on dates with guys who will just offer up that I'm not their type; in fact, I'm usually the opposite of their type in lots of ways. And then the guys get confused when I assume that means they aren't that into me... "

"Money? I feel like women who say that they care about a man's finances are vilified and immediately branded as gold diggers, and people always say that money doesn't matter, but my ex was very bad with money and it was so stressful with the constant emergencies that came up, last-minute expenses due to poor planning, never being able to go out, etc. I don't really care about someone super rich or want someone who will support me, just someone who is stable and able to pay their bills and occasionally do fun things."

"I guess as a disclaimer - I am of East Asian decent.

I think it is a really tricky topic. I am personally, only attracted to Asian men - but that doesn't mean that I will only exclusively date Asian men because things can change. I find non Asian men good looking, but I am not interested in dating them if that makes sense. Perhaps there is also the influence of culture, upbringing and all that as well.

I have huge issues with people who want to date someone outside of their I guess race or culture for the wrong reasons. I hear so many guys having 'yellow fever' or wanting to date Asian women because we are apparently 'submissive' or 'make a good housewife' or other weird stereotypes that make us 'exotic'. It is really off putting because you are fetisizing someones race and culture and I think that it is really disrespectful."

(Had an ex that would only eat chicken quesadillas from Taco Bell for dinner.  Even when we had a date he would suggest Taco Bell and whine if I made a different suggestion.  THen if he did agree to go elsewhere he woudl order plain chicken fingers (usually off the kids menu or mac and cheese also usually off the kids menu).

"I started actively noticing when people said ""no thanks"" to me, and how much of a non-issue it was, and how the people who *did* get pushy and take issue with a polite no were shitty people who didn't deserve to get everything they want.

One thing that really helped was improving my technique for telling people ""I don't want to do this but I will.""  If your friends want to ask you to dinner at a place you don't like, and you want to hang out with your friends, instead of just going along with it, try saying ""Mexican food doesn't really agree with me, but I'd love to come along and have a margarita!""  Then, if your friends are SUPER SOLD on Mexican, they don't feel like they have to give up on their food for you.  But if they were just suggesting it for the sake of having a suggestion, they'll be like ""Oh I'm also happy anywhere!  Is there somewhere else you'd rather go?""

Another thing that helps is practicing being assertive in non-no situations.  Like, taking the initiative to compliment someone.  Or inviting your friends out for an activity.  It requires putting yourself out there more, the way that saying no does, and helps fight shyness, but for some people might be easier than saying no."

Here's what I see: women being really really defenseless and (sorry for not being able to express this in any other way) abused as and reduced to just ""holes"". 

I know this is just porn and therefore just fantasy, but where a gangbang seems risqué enough, this seems exponentially that. In a gangbang at least the woman gets to see the men, here she doesn't see anything, like e.g. whether this would even be a man she is comfortable with, or whether she find the man repulsive. At least the men get a picture of the woman. 

I was always under the impression that for women moreso than men a ""whole-body-and-mind"" experience is important, as opposed to ""just in-and.out"". This is the definition of ""just in and out"". Additionally the stalls and the whole situation look unpleasant, uncomfortable and unsanitary. 

On reddit in general and ""askwomen"" especially ""men treating women like they have a right to their bodies"" is a constant topic, and rightfully so. But the topic of ""freeuse"" in general (a word I didn't know until today), as well as impregnation, seems to resonate quite a bit in this thread.



So could anyone educate me about what you see in that?"

"You may meet the love of your life in your 20s, you may date a ton of people and not meet the right one, you may have 1-2 long term relationships with the wrong people for you, or you may date very little or not at all - any of these is fine! You don't suddenly expire at 30 and if you haven't met the right person at that point, you still have plenty of opportunities to do so. Likewise, if you happen to meet the right person in your teens or 20s, you're not missing out on something you absolutely need to experience. 

I've found that attitudes toward settling down in your early-to-mid-20s (or in your 20s at all) vary wildly depending on which area of the country you reside in. (I'm in the US.) In some areas, you're looked at as strange or ""wrong"" for getting married in your early 20s. In some areas you're looked at as ""wrong"" for waiting a bit - in truth, neither one is wrong or right.

We were only about 7 months together when I got my first iud. The insertion wasn't painful but the pain after that somehow quite painful. Then the next day I got my period and the pain was somehow tripled. 

I couldn't walk much and had to take a day off from work. I whined a lot and he came to my home straight after work and brought so many stuff. He got menstrual pad because he thought I couldn't use tampon for a while. He got ibuprofen, heating pad and my comfort foods. He made some tea, then wrapped me in a blanket and rubbed my tummy until I fell asleep. 

It still bring some smile when I remember that. "
Me too! Except I'm still rocking out to TBS in my late 20s. Some things will never die. 
"PIV sex shouldn't hurt. even virgins usually experience discomfort rather than pain. don't keep doing it and hope it will go away without treatment, or you could give yourself vaginismus on top of whatever is physically wrong.

know your worth. it's not outlandish to want a committed relationship, you're not high maintenance for wanting actual effort made by somebody who supposedly wants to be with you. ''that's how it is with modern dating'' is an excuse made by lazy people and people who are afraid to ask for ''too much'' (the bare minimum)."
"Easily that sex is easier to get for girls, purely because the likelihood a guy want to have sex with them more than a girl wants to have sex with a guy.

They seem to forget the majority of these guys are 100% either unappealing or out of the question in other ways to girls. And then that okay sure, if you lower your standards enough to sleep with literally anyone, it's going to be absolutely shit sex. And not the ""bad sex is like bad pizza, still pizza/sex"" mantra, the ""I was in active pain, had all my needs and wishes ignored and disrespected, and had to go take Plan B because he took the condom off half way through."" 

There is a big barrier of understanding for some guys and the risks involved in sex for girls being that much greater. And whenever these guys are asked if they would sleep with someone old, fat, downright ugly etc, the answer is always no - so why do they never let this apply to girls? There always seems to be this assumption when talking about how easy sex is to get as a girl that all guys involved are respectful and attractive, and continues the idea that all guys want sex literally all the time, which is damaging as fuck."
"Jackhammering. Zero foreplay. Zero *interest* in foreplay. Zero interest in my body other than my boobs, vaginal area, and other ""scripted"" things (neck, mouth, ass) that they think they're supposed to touch. Routine, with longer-term partners, as in doing the same thing in the same way for the same time frame every time. Assuming that it won't take forever for me to get off. Silence. Alternately, weird dirty talk if it's something we haven't discussed before (i.e. name calling)."
I'm fine with the size. I hate their shape and sagginess.
"I'm an electrical engineer.

The biggest thing I've encountered is that, as much as companies say they want women in STEM, my personality and work style don't seem to be ""right"".

Many of the women in STEM that I know (myself included) tend to be quieter, more reserved, and more likely to evaluate all potential outcomes and complications of a project before committing to a specific approach and publicly declaring it to be the way to go.

That's not a bad thing - there's a lot of benefit to be had from that sort of perspective, and I think it can really balance out with the more gung-ho, loud and proud style of many men I work with. 

However, I notice that all the women's conferences and events focus on telling us to be louder and more dominant - traits that many people see as more masculine.

The industry focuses a lot on encouraging women to take a more active role in the STEM fields, which is great, but it needs to go both ways. I think we need to encourage industry leaders to recognize the benefits that women's different styles and perspectives offer. "

"I'm majoring in Computer Science. Sometimes I feel like I have to work twice as hard for half of the credit, if that makes sense. I also find it challenging (as someone with fairly severe anxiety and a fear of being judged) to ask questions or seek help when I'm having trouble. I'm afraid I won't be a 'person looking for help', but a 'dumb girl in the wrong field'.

Though I've made lots of friends (all male... who would have guessed?) which have really proven the contrary. While I may be the only girl or one of the only few in most of my classes, having some people who view me as a person rather than a minority gender really helps calm me."
"Still being alive. There was no real reason for it, I figured I'd die in an accident or from cancer or something, I just never in a million years expected to see thirty. Like Beth March, in Little Women:

""I only mean to say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. I'm not like the rest of you. I never made any plans about what I'd do when I grew up. I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about at home, of no use anywhere but there.""

That was me. Now here I am completely at a loss, because I didn't expect this to happen."

You could try doing the shower gel and brushing teeth before you rinse out conditioner. Conditioner is supposed to stay in your hair for as long as possible before rinsing. 
"Because a lot of young men (the most visible demographic on reddit) kind of forget that ""women"" doesn't only include extremely conventionally attractive young women with at least outwardly pleasant personalities.  Those guys are only focusing on those women that immediately catch their eye, because that's likely the prettiest, most charming girl in the room.  And they say ""she's already got a boyfriend/husband/thousand guys flocking to her"" and extrapolate that to all women.  Because they haven't noticed the other 20 girls in the room who *don't* have a bunch of guys enthralled with them.  To these guys, those 20 other women don't count, because the 21st probably *could* get a date with (*almost*) any guy if she wanted.  Those 20 other women don't count as women, even, and if the 21st ever did get rejected, it's only because she's set her sights on someone unattainable, like a movie star or an NBA player.  Because they're also not taking into account the feelings of other men any more than they're not taking into account the existence of other women.  The fact that the man that gorgeous, charming girl has a crush on is married, or gay, or prefers redheads to blondes, or prefers chubby girls to skinny girls, or thinks she's boring, or just flat out isn't all that charmed by her despite thinking she's a fine person, doesn't cross Mr. Reddit's mind, because *he* would never say no to a date with her.  

tl;dr: The people saying this both don't consider women they don't find fuckable human women at all, and also have trouble empathizing with other men who may have different tastes."
"Please, never let him do it again. He's dehumanizing you for the sake of his penis, even when you've made it clear MULTIPLE TIMES that you don't like it. Loving people stop when they're told.

Sweet and loving guys don't come with a caveat."
"Several reasons:




* Lifestyle &amp; loneliness - There's probably a handful guys on Reddit  that genuinely would date any girl who'd have em - or think they would. They're lonely and they have a lifestyle that perpetuates isolation. I do have compassion for these fellows. There are plenty of lonely and isolated women, but they're less likely to bone anyone to cure it. Probably due to the next reason.



* Age + gender differences - Men and women do a different cost/benefit analysis when deciding whether to get with someone. We have a higher expectation of risk and a lower expectation of benefit. Many reasons for this, including anatomy. The difference disippates with age, but 18- 25 is definitely the early stages.  I did my graduate research on a related topic. 



* A lot of men think women don't care about appearance. This is a lie, largely perpetrated by men who aren't willing to put the effort into getting hot."
"My soon to be ex husband threw a tantrum on a family trip. I tried talking to him and said I want us all to have a good time, that we're on a family trip. ""Well I don't want to be a family with you,"" he sneered. Six months later he got his wish. "
Probably a tie between the regular weed smoking and the pierced nipples 
Do I need to?  I just remember the ones I liked.
"Had a couple threats. 

One guy said he would leak them and mail them to my father if I didn't get back with him. I told him go ahead, I'll report you to the police because it's child porn (I was 16). He never leaked them and as far as I'm aware he deleted them when he realized. (He was 23)

Another guy threaten to leak them to get back at me for breaking up (I was of legal age now) I told him to go a head  since I was planning on posting them anyway, I wasn't ashamed of people seeing me etc. he realized he didn't have any leverage and didn't post them. Later on his computer got a virus. "
"In general any job-seeking advice from people who haven't looked for jobs in the last decade or two and have nothing to do with hiring people at their current jobs. Like I get that they're trying to be helpful, but they're always suggesting things that are completely outdated and at worst straight up counterproductive. So now it's like unless you can get me in touch with someone who might be interested in hiring me, we're not talking about my job search. "
"I think it's more like ""Don't expect someone else to complete you."" Of course, you should not be dependent on another person to be the sole purpose for your happiness and being. But If they don't complete you, or at least, compliment you, they aren't write for you."

"Current goth of 7+ years here.... It doesn't HAVE to be expensive, I thrift most of my clothes and DIY style it up. However, a sh!t ton of quality gothy pieces (good lace items, fancy dresses, corsets, big stompy leather boots) can break the bank...."
"I have triplets, so it was really rough in the early years.  Not enough hands or time to go around even with a very involved spouse. 

I got the kids to play without me fairly early on, mostly by putting them in a safe space where they couldn't do much damage and had lots of toys, and I was still in earshot to catch any attempted murders etc.  

Once we got them going down at night (we did cry it out) I made sure that I always had time to read before bed-  getting that non-negotiable quiet time saved my sanity.  I also started waking up earlier in the morning so that I have almost guaranteed alone time to start off the day.  It means a bit less sleep, but it's worth it to me. And my kids have grown up knowing that it's important for people to have quiet time, or alone time, which I think is good for their mental health too. "
"My half sister called me a 'kite', thinking it was a Jewish slur (kike).  Not only could I not stop laughing over how badly she'd messed up the insult, but both of her parents are Jewish while only one of mine is. "
"Oh yeah I know, that's why I put it in quotes. We were all still outcasts when you looked at the entire school as a whole, but we weren't necessarily rejected by the rest of the kids at school if that makes sense. Like we still went to parties and still had friends outside our group, the ""weird"" emo kids were the ones sitting on the ground in the corner of the cafeteria by themselves pretending to be wolves and shit."
One might even say this video makes us come together?
I'm very particular about jewelry so someone would have to know me well in order to pick something I'd like. All those stereotypical pieces you see in jewelry commercials are not for me
"I had a friend stay with me for a few days last month. She came by plane, so I had to drive 2 hours to pick her up, 2 hours to drop her off. She fully expected me to cover all the gas on my own and acted surprised every meal when I just paid my own, not hers too.

She started her period the 2nd and bled on my guest bed. Everyone has surprise periods sometimes, I wasn't even mad. When I offered to take her to the store to get some of her own pads and things, she refused. She just wanted to use what I had in the house. 

Two days later, I drove her back to the airport. When I parked, before she even stood up, she apologized and said she had another accident. She had packed the rest of my pads, not bothering to wear one, and bled all over my passenger seat. For two hours.

Never again. That was such a mess."

"Okay. To play devil's advocate a bit, there are some couples who drop the pretenses sooner than others. Those big fights and working out the differences can mean there's some passion present, and that both people care enough to find a workable middle ground. 

Fighting isn't necessarily an unhealthy sign. It's more *how* people fight that's a barometer of their relationship's future. "
I had no idea being a goth/metalhead was so expensive.
I used to think I would be a horse girl for life. Turns out I am a tree loving woman. Who knew? 
"The weird part of this question is defaulting to the word ""sign"".

I'm totally onside with *getting* a prenup, by which I mean we and our lawyers work out an agreement that meets both of our needs.  Unless the partner of my dreams crosses my path within the next couple of months, I'm almost certainly going to have completely paid off the mortgage on what will almost certainly end up being our matrimonial home without the support of a partner, so protecting my assets has been at the forefront of my mind lately.

But the phrasing ""sign"" a prenup elicits the idea that my partner would have an agreement all prepared without my input and expect me to put my signature on it then and there, which is highly questionable."
I just shake my butt at him. Or just grab him and pin him against the wall. I don't do subtle.
"I've had a couple of guys I was dating be all, ""but I don't waaaant to weeeaaar a condom.""

I just said well, I'm not on birth control and I don't want to get pregnant so... Your choice. They laughed at that and then they shut up and wore condoms. 

Years ago I had a guy (who I was having a ""fling"" with) remove the condom whilst we were having sex and not say anything about it. I just let it happen because I didn't know what to do about it. I went and dealt with getting the morning after pill by myself the next day. Thinking back on that makes me really angry with him and I would handle it much differently now. "
"SSRIs have been very effective at treating my anxiety but have had very little effect on my depression. So, I'm still dealing with that. I currently take Paxil. Doctor is considering adding something on to augment it. 

As for being dependent on meds, there's nothing wrong with that. People with diabetes are dependent on insulin. People with bad eyesight are dependent on glasses. You have an illness and you have every right to treat it. 

"
"I DON'T KNOW!  It seems like it's become a *really* prominent thing in the past couple of years.  I don't even think there are that many people out there who have suddenly developed incest fetishes... I just think it's the latest ""naughty"" thing that can add a little bit of excitement to the life of the average sexually frustrated otaku who's burned out on lolitas and panties.  These little sister characters are total wish fulfillment, too.  They always seem to be into porn and video games, they're sexually aggressive, and they're ridiculously devoted to their ""onii-chan""... 

I guess it's like an idealized ""easy mode"" relationship.  A little sister like that will never reject you, and you don't have to awkwardly approach her because you're already comfortable with each other.  She's already horny and obsessed with you, so you don't have to do any work to develop the relationship.  You don't even have to worry about her interests or feelings because she's only interested in things you like and her only feelings revolve around you... ugh it's so fucking gross.  The incest (while gross) actually bothers me a *whole* lot less than the way these shows reduce girls and women to shallow male fantasies."
Buying a decent Magic Wand and discovering porn in the form of gifs rather than videos.

"When I was 18, I shaved my head on a dare. My mother looked at me, burst into tears and wailed, ""I knew it! I knew you were a fucking dyke! You're ugly and have never had a boyfriend, and now your hair, you're a fucking dyke!"" As if that was the worst possible thing for me to be. I laughed as I'm about as straight as one can be and did have a boyfriend at the time. She forgot that part. 

And she still wonders, though not to me, why I don't have anything to do with her anymore. "
Honestly ranch dressing is the only good choice here 
"Edgelady teenage baby-atheist who almost refused to go to her sister's bat mitzvah, but eventually cooperated. I had all these pins on my backpack, I got snippy, and I was so, so supercilious.

Yeah, I've definitely mellowed the fuck out - I teach at a Jewish day school, my Jewish culture is a very clear part of who I am, and I've arrived upon ""agnostic"", because I'm not comfortable with absolutism.  The doubting kids look to me, for some reason (I've never put my faith-stance out there, but they know I'm non-practising), and I'm happy to be a spirit guide that teaches them to be who they are, but to be kind, too. "
Averaging less than seven and a half hours of sleep per night only ever leads to me crashing and burning somewhere down the line.
"I made the mistake of going to law school when the market is horrible where I am. I have $150,000+ in loans (this is considered massive, in Canada) and find myself having to work for free just to boost my resume. 

What's worse, is when I received admission into law school (one of the most respectable ones here, I might add), everyone outside of the field had all these expectations that I would just be rolling in it strait out of school. So when they see how I'm doing, and don't know the market, I can see that they're wondering how I fucked up so badly."
"I once briefly saw a guy who would always ask me if I came after clumsily fingering me for like two minutes. I felt so much pressure to orgasm, it was a huge turn off."
"Until you are actually interested in looking for a ~~litre~~ life partner, just break up if things in your relationship are hard consistently.  If you are definitely not getting married (Or moving in with,  buying a dog with an SO) until after college, then you don't have to treat your college relationships that seriously. I'm not saying leave if he likes black olives and you like green,  but if there is some lifestyle,  interest,  preference,  etc that is making the relationship hard,  don't stay and work through it.  Just part ways as amicably as possible.

"I agree, and this helped me, too. Realizing that an authentic ""no"" is far, far more polite and gracious than a fake/ forced/ unhappy ""yes"" was super helpful for me, too. Now, that's not to say that sometimes obligations or doing things that aren't your first choice isn't needed - that, too, is manners. No one *wants to* help someone move, but sometimes you have to help people. In other cases, though, I'm thinking for invites to things, you don't *have to* attend all the things "

"My mom unfortunately let me do whatever I wanted to my hair. At my school there were the ""cool"" emo/scene kids and the ""weird"" emo/scene kids. I was a part of the cool kids group because I was full blown emo/scene with the teased bleached hair, bands tees, ripped skinny jeans, etc. I don't regret it, I just wish I stopped after my sophomore year of high school so when I switched schools my junior year I would've made more friends. I didn't stop being ""alternative"" until the middle of senior year. "
"Having a messy house.  I will not live in filth, and I sure as hell will not be the only one cleaning.

And I hesitate to say it because it will make me *very* unpopular, but I will not date a dog owner.

Oh my god that sounds awful. Especially hearing your da say that about you. I think if you haven't already you should go and see your local gp about how you are feeling. Make even just talking to him about things will help you or maybe he could recommend some counselling to help you overcome this 
"That I was better than everyone else. ""You're so smart and mature for your age."" ""You're at the top of the class!"" ""You're like a child prodigy."" ""You're way ahead of your peers."" 

Eventually my peers caught up. And I didn't know what to do, because my identity had been shaped around being the best, and now I wasn't the best anymore, so what did that make me? I still don't know how to evaluate myself without comparing myself to others or going by what other people think of me. I feel like I don't know who I am. "
"Any job seeking advice, *especially* if it comes from someone who hasn't looked for a job since the 90's or retired from theirs before online applications were a thing. It's really quite depressing to be reminded of the fact that, yes, you're still looking, and no, dropping off your resume isn't how things work anymore, Michelle! "
"When I was younger, I wanted to move to Canada. I was convinced that was where I would start my life, and I was even going to attend university there to get a head start on my citizenship. 

I visited the school and I hated it. It was objectively beautiful, but the people were awful and the city was shit. 

End of my Canada phase. I kept the free uni shirt, though. "

A few days later I decided actually, I'd rather be single forever than be miserable with him. "
"When I found out my ""boyfriend"" at the time was sexting at least a dozen other girls. We were watching a movie in bed and he dozed off as usual. His phone wouldn't stop buzzing on the desk so I decided to see who it was. Doesn't it open to a convo with another girl who he's planning to meet the next night. He had been texting her while he sat beside me with his hand on my leg... fuckin sick. I decided to look through the rest of the messages and that's when I found all the other girls. Oh man was I furious. I literally saw red. I would have sucker punched him right in the balls if he wasn't my only way home. Instead I texted a friend for a ride but she was about 40 mins out. I took that time to text all the girls and let them know what was up. Deleted all the messages on his end so they could play it however they wanted when Prince Charming finally got back to them. I slid out while he still sleeping and scratched the fuck out of his brand new truck when I left, since apparently that's the only thing he had feelings for. He called me about an hour later wondering why I had left... I told him to ask the dozen girls in his phone if they might know why and never spoke to him again. "

"Liking guys better than girls.  Not in the sexual sense; I mean as friends.  I wasn't a girly-girl and high school I frequently declared ""I just get along better with guys"" and, barring a very few close female friends, I thought I ""didn't like women"" and thought this was a function of my personality/temperament.  I was smugly proud of this.

I think my personality DID play a role, but it was also a function of me extrapolating the worst traits in the girls I didn't like as an adolescent (judgmental, catty, insecure, changed personalities around boys) to represent all girls--which was short-sighted and frankly just stupid.  

I wised up in college.  I am not sure why I did this, given my biases, but I chose to attend a woman's college.  That experience helped opened my eyes.  Now as an adult I have many wonderful women friends who have enriched my life immeasurably, and I relate to them in ways I can't relate to my men friends or my husband."

"I care a lot that he thinks I'm funny and laughs easily at my jokes and sense of humour. It's not that I *won't* admit to that, but more that's its kind of awkward/braggy to be like ""he needs to recognize my comedic genius"", haha.  
  
*I* think I'm hilarious and I just really like making people laugh, it's very gratifying to make someone burst out laughing and I'm basically delighted when it happens.  
  
I dated someone who would kind of *begrudgingly* laugh when I was funny, it kind of annoyed him that he wasn't ""the funny one"" in the relationship, and I found out that even though it doesn't seem like a dealbreaker to a lot of people, a partner who easily and often laughs with you and really loves (instead of tolerating) your sense of humour is super important to me.

"If I go shopping in Sephora wearing no makeup and dressed in workout clothes (and I'm not talking cute athleisure wear), I'm basically ignored. If I go in with a full face of makeup and a cute outfit, like 5 salespeople are asking if I need help finding any products.

It's not just pure looks, it's also how you dress and present yourself. "
"My uncle was begging my husband and I to let his 45 yr old son move in with us and we said sure.  Cousin asked if his girlfriend could move in as well.  She would be moving a great distance and pretty much starting over. 

I said we would cover her portion of rent until she got on her feet and got a job.  6 months passed and still no job.  We finally said that we couldn't keep paying her portion, and that since they had her daughter (she wasn't supposed to live here full time, but that happened), and his son on the weekends that they should pay at least half.

They argued that because we have cats we have 4 people living there full time and should pay more. 

I seriously don't think they're grateful at all that we were covering an extra $300/mo to help them out.  She still has yet to get a job, and my cousin has been complaining to me that he's spending more money than he makes per month supporting 3 other people.  I told him Pizza Hut across the street is hiring.

Also in this time: she hates his son.  My little 10 year old autistic cousin.  She can't stand him.  We've had to step in when she starts screaming at him to say it's not appropriate AND MY COUSIN JUST STANDS THERE AND LETS HER TREAT HIM LIKE THAT.

She's insanely jealous, checks his facebook to make sure he isn't messaging any exes (including the time she had a melt down when he asked his ex to get his son to the dentist).  She's a ""recovering"" alcoholic.  She hasn't established herself in AA down here and has had several relapses, including once getting really aggressive towards me.  She apologized for that the next day...while drunk. 

This whole thing has been a fucking nightmare.  My poor cats are terrified of her.  I can't wait until our lease is up."
"Yes this omg. It's so hot. My fave is the moan/sigh of content my husband does as soon as he enters. It's amazing.

I had an ex who would not make noise. At all. Giving him a blowjob? I had absolutely not fucking clue how I was doing until he was like, ""Oh I'm gonna cum."" Like oh. Okay. "
"""Long distance never works""

Husband and I were long distance the first 4 years of our relationship. It was rough but man oh man did we build a solid foundation of trust and communication"
One of the fringe benefits of having a Chinese stepmom is going out for dinner at the local Chinese restaurant and getting a big spread from the *actual* Chinese menu. :D
"Yep, this is my answer too. And ""You'll appreciate it when you're older"" is my second most hated thing to hear.

Will I really? Will I give that many shits about looking 40 when I'm 50? Is there something so horribly wrong with looking 50 when I am indeed 50? 

And even if I do care about it when I get to be 50, none of that is relevant to the HUNDREDS of times people have insulted the fuck out of me by telling me I look like a child when I'm in my mid-20s. When I'm 50, I'll still be pissed about all those insensitive assholes who thought it was ok to say that."
"""Your freckles are so cute, I didn't know black girls could have them"""
"&gt; A lot of men think women don't care about appearance. This is a lie, largely perpetrated by men who aren't willing to put the effort into getting hot.

Also that dumbass sexist stereotype that ""men are visual, women are emotional"""
Did you confront them about the extra charges?
"The day I turned 18 I went out and got two awful tattoos I put zero thought into. Thats not true, I put one thought into it and that thought was, ""Which ones will piss my mom off the most?""

I don't hate mine, either. I just sorta wish I'd gotten better ones."
I moisturize with nice smelly lotion as soon as I'm dry after a shower. Also drink tons of water. 
Aldi is the only major grocery chain in the US to employ this method haha.
The same people who shame me for it are the same people who are also enjoying it themselves. It's so hypocritical for a guy to watch porn and then shame the person for doing it. 
"&gt; ""another girl I've been with has done this""

So, then why aren't you still having sex with her? "
I think the signs that I had never crushed on a woman but had always crushed on boys was the give away. It was so left field she was just reading the clues.
"""A lot of men wouldn't like your attitude.""

Good, I don't feel like talking to those men anyway."

You don't want no scrubs. A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from you.

"I was often told that I was too blunt and straightforward as a kid. In college, I realized how valuable it could actually be to my friends to have someone around who isn't afraid to say, ""You're being really creepy right now, we don't like you, and you need to leave."" "
"[bellesa!](https://www.bellesa.co/#first) this has been a phenomenal find ! 

Editing to add more : it's an adult site that's very women friendly and it has many videos from various websites. I  have only ever been pleasantly surprised at the collection and quality , highly recommend. Also shoutout to /r/chickflixxx for doing the same ! "
"Lots of people have kids, who should not be having kids. That's just a biological function anyone sufficiently healthy and fertile is capable of.

I would say self-sufficiency. Can you support yourself, feed yourself, pay all your bills, etc. Some people who cannot, still have kids, so that's an indicator of nothing."
That's actually horrible; I would be so upset :(

"Did you reply, completely deadpan, ""You do know that I'm a girl, right?"" 

That's all I would have been able to say to that."

"Backpacking. I went this weekend and had so much fun! Beautiful scenery, great exercise, eating ALL the things; I kind of want to go out every weekend."
"Cool. Maybe it worked for you. But studies have shown that the majority of people don't benefit from shaming when it comes to weightloss.

So many of them are so insecure about their penises they probably assume that we're as insecure about boobs. 
Yay!!!!!! I'm so glad your sister is okay!!!!!! 
"I think it was the opportunity. She was only hanging out at my restaurant because her 22 year old boyfriend worked at the store across from it. It wasn't that she wanted quiet time, she just hung around until he got off work then went with him, because he worked at a wine shop and they didn't allow under 21. 

Her mom had stopped giving her any money because she was spending it on him."
Um I'm super paranoid and I'm pretty sure I have fewer regrets than most because I literally did nothing rebellious or experimental as a teen lol
"&gt; She had packed the rest of my pads, not bothering to wear one, and bled all over my passenger seat.

You say she acted surprised that you didn't pay for her meals, and maybe I'm overthinking this, but could she have done this as some form of revenge for not giving her free stuff she felt entitled to? I almost can't believe someone on their period would just ""forget"" to wear a pad and not bother with anything while they're bleeding on your car seat for 2 hours. "
"Because I'm wife material? Yeah, beats me why that logic works. But okay. "
