"I wouldn't call him a ""ladies man"" per se, but there's no way that someone like George Costanza would have dated as many women as he did. He's very shrill and dour even outside of the fact he's not very conventionally attractive. "
"For me, it was about this girl in my elementary school class. She was super disliked because she smelled, wore the same clothes almost every day, and was always asking for people to give her part of their lunch. When I attended a birthday party for another classmate, the girl was invited too. Her gift for the birthday girl was... An incredibly beat up old board game, with a falling-apart box and multiple pieces missing. She was so upset to give it to the birthday girl, too. At the time I thought this girl was so, so weird and that she was being a brat about the present. Now I realize that all this is explained by her being extremely poor and needing to give one of her own beloved toys because she couldn't afford to buy a present! My stomach drops every time I think about her and how badly she was treated in school."

Elaine: ""so she cut it up and ate it with a fork?""

Jerry: *shakes head* ""No, she used a fork to hold up the angular part of the slice to stop it from drooping rather than use two hands like a decent human being""

Elaine: ""Weird.""

Jerry: *opening water bottle* ""I know."""
"In my experience, most men treat me with a greater respect for my personal boundaries (emotional, physical, etc) once they find out that I am married. There are some that do not, but I have found that most men treat me more like my boundaries are firm rather than negotiable when they know I am married. Both when I was single and when I was in non-married relationships, my personal boundaries were often treated as negotiable or unimportant by a larger number of men than do so now that I am married."

"Lack of communication. Two of my roommates are a couple. The guy has a fear of being tied down, so he travels often, most of the time without sharing much detail. He'll just pack up a tent and go camping for four days without telling anyone where he's going. Or he'll fly out to Alabama to visit his parents and hitchhike back slowly. The weirdest thing to me is I'll ask his GF casually where he's off to this time, and she'll often say, ""I have no idea."" I couldn't handle a partner like that."
"Recently, the stereotype that our entire being is sassy and ghetto. I was at a friends for game night, we were playing Uno. I simply was like “girl don’t look at my cards” and her entire family mimicked me but made it way more than it was like i had said “GURRRLLL DONT YOU BE LOOKIN AT MY CARDS” when that’s not how i said it... at all. "
"I'm white, so my results may vary.

I grew up in a rural part of Florida which was predominantly white.  About 1% of my high school were minority students.

*People talked openly about family being in the KKK.
*My parents and older folk are openly racist, but don't call them that because they deny it.
*Students pretty much shunned dark skinned minorities.
*There was a rumor that the KKK put a burning cross in the only black family's lawn, but nothing in the papers.
*School openly had student led prayer during school hours to ""pray for the victims of 9/11"".  Not necessarily racist, but the ""in Jesus name, amen"" at the end was not exactly inclusive.

Now I live in a major metro area in the same state.  I've not personally witnessed many instances of overt racism, but I've noted at least one instance of subtle racism. 

I was working at a coffee shop and a lady accused us of stealing her credit card.  I was working with an all-black team and the customer pulled me aside after I took her info so I could call her in case her card turned up.  She said, ""I know she stole it.  They're all like that, you know.""  
""That's a serious accusation, ma'am.  Did you witness her take it?"" I asked.
""No, I just know she did it! Don't you know what I mean? They're all just looking for easy money!!""

I told her to leave. Like, wtf?? Still burns me up thinking about it.

She came back a few days later for some coffee and she told me she found it. I told her we couldn't serve her anymore.  "
"Partners who won't do anything for themselves, especially around the house. Whether that's laundry, making appointments, keeping track of events, cleaning, cooking, etc...I don't get it. 

I am still a bit early into my pregnancy right now and I am so exhausted and nauseous all the time. I can't imagine having a useless husband who would claim he ""doesn't know how"" to do all the household stuff that needs to get done. "
Charlie Sheen. Fucking gross. 
"I thought the popular Christmas song  ""I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus"" was about adultery.  

I was like ""Who in The fuck is going to be okay with walking in on their mom making out with an old man?! Where is the Dad? Why is this even a Christmas song?""

Then I realized it was the dad dressed up as Santa.   I was 29."
I have to crack my hips before sex. And it's alarmingly loud.
"I cheated on my boyfriend while on a trip to Spain. I told him as he drove me home from the airport. He dumped me on the spot and asked me to get all of my stuff out of his place when we got back. A week later while trying to reconcile with him, he said that he was originally planning on proposing to me, but he's glad that he didn't because it would have been the worst mistake of his life. 

I felt like complete shit after that. That was years ago and I still feel bad about it because he was a really great guy who didn't deserve what happened to him."
Exactly. Now every hollywood quickie where people just get dressed and walk their way makes me wonder how she manages to keep her grace and calm with semen in her underwear.

"I thought penetrative sex would be the most amazing, mind-blowing experience of my life. Movies/tv/books/porn etc had me convinced that it would involve the most incredible sensations ever and then boom, orgasm.

Then I had sex for the first time and PiV was actually pretty boring. It didn't feel that great. And tbh I've never thought that much of it over the years since- no matter who I've been with.

...I wish it was like the movies.  "
"1. That wearing our natural hair in a business setting makes us somehow less unprofessional then our white  female coworkers.

2. When a client speaks to me on the phone or in a face to face meeting for the first time and their 'reaction' and body language is a dead giveaway that they did not know a black women could hold such a high corporate position. No, im not the assistant. Yes, i have one. 

3. That we are less educated or less qualified to accomplish anything greater than mediocrity. See #2

"There are many, but here's the one that's been SUPER annoying lately:

For the entirety of my life up until about 2 months ago, I had wanted a world globe. It seems like a weird lifelong wish to have, but I swear to Jebus I wanted it so bad. My mother got one for me about a month and a half ago. It's so fucking beautiful. It's in my room, in it's own little corner, just being pretty...or trying to be, since it's under a MASSIVE FUCKING PILE OF MY HUSBAND'S CLOTHES. 

Not two weeks into having it, he started using it as a clothes rack! It infuriates me to no end. I told him the goddamn globe was off limits and he stopped doing it for maybe two days. Last night I found the shirt he'd just taken off neatly laid out on top of it. 

Goddamnit, I JUST WANNA LOOK AT THE FREAKIN GLOBE , not your I-wore-this-twice-maybe-I-need-to-wash-it-but-I-might-wear-it-again clothes!"

"One of my best friends is married to a child. The man has a freaking chore chart for Pete's sake, and doesn't even follow it. He'll say he dusted, when he literally just wiped down the TV screen and nothing else. He works a part-time night job and has zero aspirations. He naps all day while my friend works as much overtime as she can get so that someone is paying the bills. He does watch their son during the day, but he's school-aged now so he pretty much just gets the kid to school in the morning (when he remembers to) and watches him a couple hours in the afternoon. By that point, my friend is off work and now it's her turn to watch their son and make dinner and do all the cleaning he didn't do.  He's constantly taking advantage of her and embarrassing her in front of friends and family.

I've tried for years to be the supportive friend, but now I've lost my filters and have no problem asking her why she hasn't thrown him out on his ass."
Yep. Married and subsequently divorced a “poet” and art school dropout. It was easy to excuse his abusive behavior as him just struggling with inner demons that I as his “muse” needed to coddle him through by being his maid/mother/vagina
"That it was going to bleed and hurt. No blood, no pain. It was quick and fun."
That my mom really was doing the best she could under what were incredibly bad circumstances. 
"Definitely, 100% the idea that the most pleasurable thing for any and every woman is the merest insertion of anything into the vagina, and all other factors are unnecessary to her pleasure. (See also: occasional questions here along the line of “do you ever stop to pleasure yourself while inserting a tampon?” or something on a similar angle.) "
"I hate the stereotype that we must want to be White if we don’t fit within the clearly defined list of actions and beliefs that society says black women are supposed to be (this stereotype is usually coming from other black people, which makes it sadder). 

Oh look! That black woman dyed her hair a color that isn’t typically associated with black people. She clearly wishes she was White!

Oh my GOD. That black woman is dating a White guy. Doesn’t she know that she’s supposed to save herself for a black man?? She clearly wishes she was White.

Good Lord. That black woman likes country line dancing! This is humanity’s worst affront to nature! She clearly wishes she was White!

And so on. I mean, I get that “black” isn’t merely a skin color, it’s a culture. Doing things outside the customs of the culture can make it seem that we are ashamed of said culture. If I don’t like soul food, you can kind of see how that may come across as me looking down my nose at my own culture. But there has to be some kind of limit, where we can like different things and simultaneously have respect for our roots. 

Do other cultures go through this? If a Scottish person doesn’t like haggis, are they given shit for not being “Scottish enough”?"
"""Why would I fake an orgasm? When I start have sex I'm not gonna pad my guys ego if he didn't deserve it. Plus how's he gonna figure it out if I fake it. Girls are dumb.""

Trying to avoid nurturing the incredibly frail male ego after he fails to make me finish trumps all the logic stated above. 

Guys, if you want girls to stop faking it, don't act like a whiny piss baby when you come first. The last thing we want to be after not cuming is emotional support. "

"I get very, very little alone time. He works early mornings and I work 8-5. So by the time I get home, he is home too. He is off on Saturdays and works Sundays and is a homebody. Most of his friends are online, and he has no interest in wasting money going out all the time. I only get maybe 3 hours a week home alone on Sunday and it just is not enough.

I want to be able to blast music, dance and sing terribly in utter solitude. I can't do that. Even when I stay up late at night for alone time I have to be quiet so I don't wake him. Even then he randomly wakes up and comes down stairs.

I went from living with my mom to living in my own house and never attended a dorm college, so I never had roommates to get used to living with someone else that wasn't a parental figure. It's been a challenge. Sometimes I take sick days from work just so I can have a few hours alone at home."

"Yeah, but there's an early episode where a fortune teller puts a curse on Johnny that turns him into a woman, so he can see how his behavior looks from the other side.

He is literally hit on by every single man who sees her, so it's safe to say that in the Johnny Bravo Universe, women experience a never-ending stream of pickup lines that completely camouflages any attractive traits that Johnny might have."

Good and bad. Some of the guys who hit on me are really sweet when I tell them I’m married. They say he’s a lucky man and walk away. Then we have the ones who say he doesn’t have to know or tell me I’m too young and it’s not gonna work out. I assume they’re just upset I turned down their advance. 
"I have to pick one?

I hate the angry Black woman stereotype. Frustration, irritation, tiredness, or worst of the worst, valid anger at a legitimately infuriating situation = angry Black women. I remember working retail especially and if I was anything less than perky, I “seemed mad.”

Also, anything involving being undesirable, not beautiful, unattractive, unfeminine... all that bs"
"I was a bad kid as a young teen, like 12-14. I stole cash money out of my grandma's purse a few times. My grandma, the nicest woman I've ever known who only ever cared about taking care of everyone, and especially me, whom she cared for when my mom couldn't be a stay-at home mom anymore because money was tight, who made me spaghettio's in my favorite bowl with the handle and bought be tons of paper and pencils and crayons and markers and always encouraged me to develop my art. Who plastered her kitchen with my drawings. Honestly, I probably wouldn't draw as good as I do now if not for her. She died before I got myself straightened out. The best I can do now is aspire to be as much like her as I can."
"My mom is a smoker, and she's always smoked in the house. I wondered why people kept asking me if I smoked since I was only a kid. 

Now I know it's because I smelled like a fucking ash tray. To this day she refuses to believe it smells that strongly and thinks I'm being petty about getting the smell on my clothes and in my hair when she visits. I'm so mad and embarrassed knowing that that's what I smelled like through my whole damn childhood. "
I thought as soon as a man came that his penis would immediately be soft 
" That you can just shove your dick in any orifice and she'll love it.  It's not just stupid, it's dangerous.  Tearing happens, trauma happens, and your dick is not the magical exception.  It's just not.  "
He leaves all the lights on all the time and always forgets to close the cabinet doors.
When I was 10 our dog killed a kitten that belongings to the neighbors. Their cat had just had a litter. I got off the bus and he came up to me with it in his mouth. I buried it in the woods behind our house and didn't tell anyone because I was afraid my parents would get rid of him.
"Rapid fire cunnilingus and slapping it, hate it. Add gentle pressure and do it slowly, like a massage."
"I have a similar one. In middle school there was a boy who everyone thought was nerdy and weird. He wore glasses, always a polo with tucked in shirt and pants. No one wanted to sit next to him in class and my teacher sat me by him. It made me uncomfortable because he would ask me out a lot and always want hugs. Put his arm around me, etc. I didn't like it of course and I was 12. I had asked my math teacher if she could please move me to another seat and she said ""everyone else already doesn't want to sit by him by you're very nice so can you stay where you are?""  So I did. I always tried to politely decline his request for me to be his girlfriend. 

People were very very mean to him and at the time I brushed it off because I didn't really like him either. I was never mean but I also didn't want to be around him. It wasn't until a couple years ago working with my special needs kids that it clicked. I suddenly remembered the boy from middle school and realized he had a special need and was in mainstream classes. "
"Yes, I've met many of these. Thankfully, an asshole is an asshole, and I don't tolerate being treated badly because the person can be profound.

This type of person talks a lot about ""I'm the kind of person who..."" They make sure you know they are a feminist, artistic, a reader, a writer, loves music. 

You aren't your interests. You are your behavior. No hobby can undo the fact that you're selfish, self absorbed, and un-empathetic. "
Allowing their partner to hate their kids from another relationship ...wtf is wrong with you 
Because I'm not a 17 year old high school student.
"That you don’t need lube for anal, or that spit will suffice. I’m not saying there has never been a person that worked for, but overall lube and foreplay are crucial with anal.

Along the same topic, going from anal to PIV with no cleanup is never a good idea. Do not do it. Ever."
"Guy from *Love.* Not cute, not particularly charming, and he's kind of a doormat. "
"Partners who don't stand up for them.  

Like...you're a team! Why are you leaving your teammate to the wolves?!

My SO has been 100% on my side since day 1, going to bat for me against his own family even.  I just don't see how all these people stay with partners who won't do the same for them. (I read a lot of JUSTNOMIL)

I'd scorch the Earth on that before I left in the blaze of glory. "
"I have a [S O F T B O Y E](https://i.imgur.com/acESgf4.jpg), does that count?"
"Oh lord, do roommates who have a crush on you count? Cause if so I have stories for *days*. 

I guess the first moment when I realized my roommate was a ""nice guy"" happened shortly after I moved in. We were driving somewhere and he was lamenting about how I turned him down 2 years ago when he tried to hit on me me, and he was saying stuff like ""If I'd have done X differently and said this and that in a better way, I think you would have dated me. I'm not going to make that same mistake this time around though, I'm not letting you go again!"" Wait... what? This time around? Not letting me go again? Bruh we're just roommates, I'm not your girlfriend! If I'd known he'd had hinky motives for inviting me to come live in his spare room I wouldnt have moved in, even though I was going to be homeless otherwise. 

I responded with something like, ""Well, it's not up to YOU whether I date you or not, it's up to ME. There is literally nothing you could say or do to make me or any other woman date you if we don't already want to. I'm not some puzzle box that you have to twist and manipulate just right to unlock a relationship"". He was quiet for a few seconds and then said, ""I dunno, I know you pretty well and I think you'd have given me a chance if I'd have done a few things differently. I'm a nice guy and I've done a lot for you, there's no other reason for you to turn me down unless I just said or did something wrong""

I will admit I raised my voice at him after that. That incident was nearly 4 months ago and he is STILL trying. 

If stuff like this does count, lemme know and I can tell you so many more stories about this guy. I could fill up r/niceguys, r/justneckbeardthings, and r/badroommates with stories about him. "
"I will answer, but I probably need to preface this by saying I was young and dumb.  That is not an excuse, that is telling you I am a different person now.  And I have worked hard to make amends for many assholish things I have done.

Ok, I broke into an old ladies house when I was a teenager and trashed the place.  She was an old lady who lived in a small house by herself.  It was not my idea, but I went along with it because I was a complete and terrible person at the time.

We broke in while she was gone and ripped up her cushions on the couch, spilled milk on her floor, threw things around, and did just bad things.  We even wrote the name of a girl we all hated on the wall in permanent marker, I guess making some lame attempt at implicating her.

Years later, I went back to her house to apologize, but she had passed years earlier and no one lived there.  I am deeply sorry for the pain and terror I caused her."

"I used to get mad that my mom worked such long hours and didn’t get me a lot of presents. I went to a private school so I was surrounded by other kids with nice clothes whose families went on fancy vacations. I was also embarrassed that she didn’t ever wear fashionable clothes. It seemed like she wore the same few outfits all the time and never bought herself any new clothes. I didn’t understand why my mom was so cheap. I mean she worked way longer hours than most of my friends’ parents. I wasn’t until I was a bit older that I realized different jobs paid different salaries, and just because my mom worked a lot didn’t mean she made a lot of money. I also realized as an adult she was paying almost entirely out of pocket for my private schooling and that’s why she never bought herself new clothes. "
"My husband leaves his dirty dishes out constantly because he ""doesn't know"" if the dishes in the dishwasher are clean or dirty (without even opening the dishwasher) Open your eyes man! But seriously,  if that's the worst of it,  I'll keep him.  "

"Friends no difference other than them asking ""How's married life"" jokingly to annoy me.

Otherwise.... It's weird, my male coworkers tried to be friends with me more.  I wasn't expecting that and it's weird.  I don't know why, I haven't asked, but I wonder if it's because it's ""safer"" to be friends with me now that I'm married myself.  Like they feel more confident telling their own spouse that they went to lunch with someone who was married than the single girl at work.

Seems ridiculous to me, the likelihood of me flirting with coworkers went from zero to zero."

* When my mom was in high school, one of her neighbors dated a white girl and his family got so many death threats, they had to move 

* My grandparents were different races and not allowed to get married until after 1967 

I want to believe that it's a better place but it seems like every time I go back, things haven't changed much except for what's publicly acceptable. "

"As a lesbian the difference is I think a little wider than for women married to men. 
Before marriage men fetishized my relationship, asking intimate questions about our sexual, emotional, and social lives. They would get upset and concerned if she invited me to her work functions, because ""we said you could bring your partner, not your current fling"". After we got engaged and I started referring to her as ""my fiancé"" with female pronouns they would question whether we were valid enough for marriage. Things like: are you sure? Have you even done x y and z together? Don't you want to play the field? See what you're missing? (Read: Men). The phrase ""no thanks I have a girlfriend"" does absolutely nothing to deter male advances. In some cases it makes it worse. 
In short, they didn't give us the basic respect that they gave the relationships of straight women. 

After marriage no one questions how much I love her. People accept that we are a packaged deal. They back off when I show them my ring. When we introduce ourselves with the same last name they accommodate us.   

Honestly it's been such a stark difference. "

"My entire dating life has been ""safe"" choices. They've all been stable emotionally and financially, interested in living a fairly normal life, risk-averse. I'm attracted to that, so married life with that has been excellent!"
"Having a spouse who is not an equal parent to rearing a child and maintaining a household. Also having a spouse that cannot handle the ebbs and flows of life. I'm heavily pregnant and can't do a lot. My husband picks up the slack because we're a team. And should there be a time when he's sleep deprived, sick or whatever, I'll pick up the responsibilities he can't. 

Also needing ""permission"" to do something from your spouse, unless it's something like dropping a ton of money or something re: our kiddo - always a joint decision. If my husband told me he didn't allow me to wear something/go somewhere I'd laugh in his face. I am not property, let alone his property. "
Good for you to tell her she's not going to be served there anymore! 
"They're the worst.  It's much easier to deal with an outright asshole, because their bad behaviour is so much more blatant and easier to avoid."
If it makes you feel better Daniel Craig agrees. He said in an interview once that he didn’t get why people thought Bond was a guy to emulate since he was literally a misogynist 
"This is underrated advice. Take the steps to make yourself attractive **to yourself**, whatever that means to you. Then find someone who agrees, who you also find attractive. "
"I'm naked a lot.  I think there's an episode where he's dating a woman who is also naked a lot, and it's all very hot and sexy for Jerry until she does something human while naked, like coughing or something, and he just freaks out because ""omg she's not a perfect sexy blow-up doll anymoooooore what do I doooo"".

So, that.

Your poor partner is gonna end up with a fetish for gunshot noises. 
"Lip from Shameless. I don't find him attractive at all, but every woman he crosses paths with on the show ends up sleeping with him. It feels really unrealistic to me.

"I'm going to keep mine relatively lighthearted. I genuinely hate the ""Elf on the Shelf."" So in the spirit of the holidays, I have two theories related to this:

1. This tradition was artificially manufactured using social media - mostly Pinterest. Supposedly the tradition originates from the children's book written in 2005...but nobody starting doing this ""tradition"" until at least 10 years later. I think this is because the makers of the elf didn't realize the power of grassroots marketing on social media until a just few years ago. All of a sudden, you started seeing posts all over Facebook and Pinterest about Elf on the Shelf as if it's been a time-honored tradition in every American household. It hasn't - but because of social media now every mom thinks she might be the only mom NOT doing it, and her kids might be missing out. (So now that's just another thing moms are expected to do to make Christmas this *""magical""* experience.)

2. This part I usually keep to myself unless I've had a few drinks...because I know it's crazy and I'm not sure if *I* even wholeheartedly believe it but...The Elf on the Shelf deliberately gets children comfortable with the idea of surveillance in their own home."
"When I was 20, I was helping my parents look for a necklace my mom lost. It was a really expensive gift from one of their past anniversaries. I ended up finding it in their bedroom. It fell between the headboard and the mattress and was stuck on the bed frame. Instead of telling them, I pocketed it and sold it for $2,600 a few months later when I went back to college.

"
joey from friends...i just can’t see the appeal sure he’s funny but that’s mostly because he’s dumb as bricks 
I could smell his breath across the table. I politely ended the conversation and promptly left after a few minutes. I just couldn't take it anymore. 
My husband always manages to go to the bathroom RIGHT before I head that way! So I'm stuck holding my pee while he takes a long thoughtful poo. We only have one bathroom so this is a common occurrence.  
"See also reacting with disgust at an actress' ""loose"" vagina because she's obviously prepped herself for the ridiculously large dick she's going to have jackhammered into her. 

Yes, the woman about to have a penis the size of a *coke can* needs to be ready before its shoved into her. No, that does not mean her vaginal muscles have deteriorated, it just means that off-camera she's warmed herself up *to prevent injury*. This is what foreplay is for, and I pity the women you sleep with."
Lol. I'm imagining some poor person being intimidated by the prepare yourself it's sexy time noise.
"I'm curious about those genetic/ancestry tests like 23 and Me, but I don't trust that the information is secure and won't eventually be used against me. When a Gattaca-esque scenario becomes real, I don't want all my genetic details in the hands of a third party."
"That my mom was actually an epic good mom. I mean, I never had a problem with her and always loved her.. but after studying child development, and reading so many Reddit stories about other people's childhoods.. damn, my mom was a master at raising kids.  

She never lied to us, she always gave us serious and straight answers to our questions.. and she never just straight up prevented us from doing things. She explained her views and mostly let us come to our own conclusions. 

Consequently, we never got into ""stupid"" drug or sex related situations based on ignorance. We never really rebelled .. and we never really felt the need to keep secrets from her, because we knew even if she didn't approve of something, she would help and not just judge. 

At the same time, she definitely guided us toward being good and honest people. She didn't act like our ""best friend"" and let us do whatever we wanted. 
I'm not even sure how she pulled off such a balance, honestly. 

I was thinking about that today when I read an article about a young girl who was snatched by an older man she met on snap chat, and her parents didn't know about him until after she was gone. 
I thought.. man.. I got into all kinds of potentially bad conversations with people online when I was a preteen. But for some reason I always felt comfortable enough to discuss who I was talking to with my mom. I think it's because she didn't freak out, and she didn't try to monitor me or ban me.. but she just taught me how to judge a person's intentions for myself. 

I hope I can be half as good at that. "
"1. Jackhammering is pleasurable 
2. If you vigorously rub the clit like you're sanding a piece of wood it feels good 
3. Most women have orgasms just from penetration 
4. You can stick your dry dick in a woman with barely any foreplay / lube 
5. You deserve to get your dick sucked despite providing barely any foreplay to the woman in return 
6. Most women like to swallow your battery acid cum "
"Boy bands package male sexuality in an approachable, non threatening way for pre-teen girls. Developing a crush on a male pop star is basically like training wheels for crushes on someone you go to school with or see in the neighbourhood. The same cannot be said for female pop stars. "
"I met a guy on OKCupid. We talked a bit and set up a date. He picked the place. It was the Olive Garden in Times Square. Just trust me that this is one of the most embarrassing places you can take a date in New York. We get there and he tells me I don't look like my picture. That's bullshit. I have five pictures, some close up, some full body, all recent. He had one terribly lit close up picture of his face that made him look about 40 pounds lighter.

They tell us it'll be a wait so I suggest sitting at the bar in the restaurant. He looks really uncomfortable at the suggestion. I take it back but he insists that we go to the bar. They eventually call us to our table and I put down $10 on a $8 drink. He sees I put down an extra $2 so he only puts down $6. And then later apologizes saying he should pay me back $2. No dude, you need to pay the bar back, do you not know what a tip is?

Then he spends the entire dinner talking about his mom. Literally the entire time. About how great he is and how he's saving up money to take her on a vacation. It's sweet but I left knowing more about the guy's mom than I did about him.

It ended fine. He asked if I'd like to go on a second date and I said that I wasn't feeling it. He was nice about it and we left on fine terms."
That's okay. My sister tried to explain sex to me by telling me that one part is supposed to go inside of another... so I decided that meant that the labia are somehow supposed to go inside of the penis. 
"If my SO checks out someone so intensely that *I* notice it, it means whoever he is checking out could probably notice it too which is no bueno. No one wants to be oggled at. "
"For me my personal boundaries were least respected while single, slightly respected when I said I was in a relationship, and most respected when I answered that I'm married. 

It's funny how guys often don't notice a wedding band. Even my husband thinks I'm telepathic when I comment that someone is probably married (because I saw a ring on their left hand's ring finger). "
"That was me. I did the following:

* I didn't know how to dress myself, so I bought a ton of pretty yet cheap clothes from all the cheap stores and experimented. Took me a while to find my style. 

* when I knew some, I went to bloomingdale's and had the assistant help me with finding pretty clothes.

* went to this expensive looking salon and had the hairdresser give me a great haircut. Took a picture and now I ask for the same thing at supercuts. 

* I had terrible skin so I take these hair skin and nails supplements. Also found skincare products that work for me. Interestingly, they turned out to be bottom of the shelf ponds cream, carmex lip balm, and dove soap. 

* I experimented with makeup from YouTube channels. Still don't know shit, but I can do basics right.

And suddenly I'm pretty

"When I was 8 I had a babysitter who had Jack Russel terriers. For those who are unaware... these are hunting dogs. Anyways I found a baby bird one day and brought it to my babysitter's house on my way back from school, and for some reason, child me thought it would be a great idea to let the dogs see the bird. Long story short the bird was ripped from my hands and I'll NEVER forget the screams :(

Other than that... my mom mixed a water and bleach cleaning solution in one of the gallon jugs I use to prep water for my fish tank. Yeah.. she didn't tell me and I assumed it was a jug I had previously prepped. In goes the water into my tank and all my fish have a slow and painful death."
"That long fingernails belong anywhere near or inside a woman's lady parts. Or pretty much almost everything that goes on during lesbian porn made for straight men is in any way realistic. 

I'm bisexual, and when I first started dating my boyfriend, he had a lot of questions about how sex with men compares and/or if different than sex with women. We'd trade notes and whatnot, it was cute. He didn't know, tho, that there are two basic types of wlw porn: porn made for men and by men, and porn made for women and by women.

wlw porn is usually made by women run production companies, and it's firmly made for the female gaze.

its just, so much better. in every aspect of the word. do yourselves a favor fellas and support women run production houses if lesbian porn is your thing, your dick will thank you."

"The last movie really pissed me off. Bond has been a real creep in the past, but Daniel Craig’s seemed a lot more progressive. Until fucking Spectre when he breaks into a woman’s house, shoots a bunch of dudes, and then immediately pushes this terrified woman up against a wall and starts making out within her. So fucking gross and rapey. Ruined the movie for me. "
"When he talks on the phone he paces.  Which is whatever, but he paces around the living room where I'm watching TV or playing video games.  He doesn't do it so much anymore but occasionally *he will ask me to turn down the tv so he can hear the phone*. 

At which point he gets the 1000 yard stare and suddenly remembers we have an entire empty upstairs he can wander to his hearts content. 

Sometimes I will have to ask him to leave the room bc he's bothering me.  It's very BEC and minor but holy hell does it make me want to yank out his eyebrows. "

"Years ago, in middle school, I sent a nude to my “boyfriend” at the time. Of course by the next day, everyone had seen it. My best friend at the time was comforting me when I came up with a brilliant idea. I asked her to send one to his best friend, so we could go down together. She actually did it, and hers outshined mine by far on the raunchy scale. A few months later, I ended up getting “sick of her” and made new friends. We’re cordial but never really talk. I’ve definitely done more fucked up things but for some reason I think about that one often. "

"The one with your hair is one of the most unfair I think. The angry/loud stereotype is just as racist and horrible, but at least the idea is ""we don't like angry people who shout.""

"I was the smelly poor kid. No one knew I'd get shit from my grandmother if I took too many showers. She said I was making her water bill go up. And that boys winter coat that the kids berated me for was a hand me down and the warmest coat I ever had. 

That was a long time ago and they were kids and didn't know any better.  I'm fine now and warm too."
"I realized way after I got away from home that, despite the fact that I love my parents and I believe they love me,I was emotionally and verbally abused the majority of my childhood.  Or possibly it is emotional neglect.

I am not sure, but it has left me bitter and angry towards people in general, but also nigh incapable of outwardly expressing my emotions naturally.  I have to really think about it to react in any way except anger."

"I think this marginally relates. This guy at work liked me and I had zero interest. I had a lot of male friends at the time, and he told me I was a “friend zoner” and that all my male friends obviously wanted to get with me. Then he told me he’s not interested in being friends with girls. 

We actually did stay friends, and he later told me that he said those things because he was trying to gauge and test my interest. Which was zero...."
"On a church retreat in high school, I had to kayak with a girl who was absolutely terrified of water. I don't mean the ocean or fish, I mean H2O in all of its forms. You would think that someone afraid of water wouldn't go kayaking unless they were actively trying to conquer their fear, but she was just holding herself, laughing hysterically in terror and not helping either me nor the girl behind us paddle. If I got a bit of water into the kayak, the tiniest little drip, she would scream loud enough to scare birds and remind me how terrified of water she was. If my paddle made a splash, she would also scream, even if the water didn't actually get inside the boat. All the while, the third girl in the back is actually lecturing me for scaring the girl.

Basically we're horrifically behind the rest of the kayakers because we only have two people paddling and I have to paddle as gently as I could to prevent her from getting scared, but even if I managed not to get water in the boat, she was still laughing hysterically, screaming about how much she hated water. If we got too far from the group, she'd scream because we were too far and want me to speed up, but when I did speed up, I would start getting a bit of water inside the boat, and once again, she would scream. Is there a way to kayak without getting a single solitary drop of water in your boat? I certainly didn't know it.

I managed to keep my cool for about twenty minutes, despite the fact that she was basically screaming in my ear for twenty minutes as well, and then finally she screamed in a way that finally annoyed me enough, I just absolutely fucking snapped.

I suddenly turned around and gave her a death glare. I then demanded to know why the hell she agreed to get inside a kayak and head out to the ocean if she was so piss-her-pants afraid of the water in the first place. She was quiet for a bit, then claimed that she agreed to go on the trip to hang out with her friends. I reminded her that all her friends went into another kayak and left her with us, despite the fact that they knew she was so afraid of water, so they were some friends indeed. I then sneered that if she keeps screaming like that any time she sees a single drop of water, I was surprised she had friends at all. I told her that if she was afraid of water, she should either suck it up while on water-centered trip, or just plain old not go.

To further rub it in, I asked her what kind of moron is afraid of water, anyway. You literally need water in order to live, so being afraid of water in general is just dumb, and asked her if she wanted to die or something. I asked her if she never showered, never drank anything, and I asked that when it drizzled, if she screamed and ran around like a caveman who thinks rain means the gods are angry with you. 

I told her that I tried to be nice, and that I tried to accommodate her, but now she was just getting too damned annoying for me to keep going. I told her to cut the crap, stop freaking screaming, and if she screamed in my ear one more time, I would throw her out of the kayak and let her swim back to shore for all I cared. She just looked at me and nodded, swallowing heavily. Now with some of my aggression out, I paddled normally, not caring whether she liked it or not.

Nobody said a single thing for about fifteen minutes. All the others had gotten to the dock ages ago and were wondering what took so long. The girl just got off the boat and ran back to her friends, hugging the leader of the friend group and not being able to speak. The leader gave me a concerned look, but I just shrugged. That's when I started to feel bad, but was also still so frustrated and baffled with her that I tried to justify the cruelty in my words. I expected to be given a stern talking to by the pastor or even the girl's friend group any minute for the rest of the trip, but it never actually happened. I'm guessing she just never told anyone what I had said, nor did the third girl, because the leader of the friend group was one of those girls that was super protective of everyone and would stand up to anyone saying anything negative about another person.

She actively ran away from me for the rest of the time we were at camp. I also never saw her in our youth group ever again. I don't know if it was because of me, but her friend said that she just decided to head to a church of a new denomination. I never saw her again, so I never actually got to apologize after I had calmed down. If you want to see me punished for what I did, I was also stupid enough to only wear a bathing suit top and a pair of shorts while kayaking for almost an hour, so I got one hell of a sunburn on my shoulders and back that hurt when air touched it, and took almost a month to stop peeling. I guess that was God punishing me Old Testament style.

TL;DR: I viciously chewed out a girl who wouldn't stop screaming while on our church camping retreat, God gives me his wrath via a killer sunburn."

i also just hate the cognitive dissonance when it comes to the same thing with black men. most people would agree that it’s racist to generalize all black men saying they are all dead beat fathers, criminals, violent, etc but people seem to think it’s just a perfectly valid opinion to negatively generalize all black women.  and it’s the worst when it comes from black men."

"My favorite letter as a kid was ""T."" I have no Ts in my first, middle, or last name. I was resentfully jealous of all other kids who were ""lucky"" enough to have a T somewhere in their name on into my teens. 

It's okay, I don't get it either. 

But I'm still a little annoyed that if I marry into my SO's last name I *still* won't get that T"
"I honestly love Joey, especially in the later seasons when he realizes he actually wants a relationship. He's a genuinely good and caring friend. Yeah, he's dumb, but being fun, funny, and kind can make up for that to a lot of people. 

I already really hated Ross, but the fact that he ruined Rachel and Joey certainly didn't make me like him any more. "
"If I ask him to do something more than once, I'm nagging. If he asks me to do something more than once, he's ""just asking, jeez."" "
"I've worked in a couple of jobs where I was the only Black person in the building. I've had a few occasions where White girls were unintentionally pulling that Scarlett O'Hara/Mammy dynamic. I'm not big, motherly, or particularly nurturing. 

One blonde dummy actually barged into my office, sat her grown ass on my lap, threw her hands around my neck and asked for comfort. I told her to get her unprofessional ass of me, and never come into my office without calfling first, She lost her knocking privileges.

"
Yeah but dirty after work and then taking a shower is different fr9m doesn't brush teeth or use deodorant
"I think I had to experience an even more horrible delayed-understanding situation.

I attended private, religious school with a girl, and also was on the same (not Girl Scouts but similar) troop as she was. 


She confided to me that her Daddy peed in her mouth. 

I was SO SHELTERED and so, so naive. 

I called her a liar. Told her that was gross. Then deleted the memory of this until I was about 20~ years old. 

When I did recall what she told me, with the 20-20 lens of adulthood, it made me sick. Just, horribly guilty to imagine that if I had repeated that phrase to ANY adult around me, perhaps....... 

I'm forever sorry. I wish I could find her but what good would it do?

"&gt; But no one discusses sexual/anatomical incompatibility.

That was definitely one thing left out in health class. I had no idea there could be such a variety of sizes when it came to dicks and vaginas. My highschool boyfriend was very well endowed and I had no idea at the time. I thought he was average and I just thought something was wrong with me when it was painful or we had trouble getting started."
Holy shit. She cared so much about you she didn't just hold on to the sinking ship. She jumped on to keep you company. 
"Back in highschool there was this girl who everyone was like wow she really grew up between sophomore year and junior. 

No, her face and size didn't change at all. She got her frizzy hair in check, got new clothes that weren't baggy and was putting on light makeup. "
"When making food, he doesn't clean up as he goes along. Even when we finish eating there will be at least a couple of hours before he begins clearing up the aftermath. This is why I wash up pretty much immediately after eating! "
"Choose your heels wisely. Wedges work well for me and cause minimal pain. Stilettos are, of course the worse - the fatter the heel, the better support. It also sucks to say, but spend more money on heels and your feet will thank you. This wasn’t realistic for me until my late 20s, unfortunately, so my feet didn’t feel the benefit til about a year ago, but if you’re buying heels that are less than $80 or so (depending on where you live, of course), they’re probably going to hurt. 

I’ve not had very much luck with comfort insoles, but some do. "
"Your comment made me burst out into tears because I just got out of a one year relationship last week (my first relationship, my first love) where I was regularly insulted, cursed at, etc. In retrospect, I can't believe I tolerated it. Thank god I left."

"When I was fourteen, a married man was insistent in hitting on me, and touching me. I knew it was wrong in so many ways, but young kid me said “fuck that Irish accent is sexy”. Two years later, we did end up sleeping together, and he wouldn’t really leave me alone. I started to feel bad about what I did, and regretted sleeping with him, but he still wouldn’t back off. I called him a few months later and told him I was pregnant. He stopped talking to me after that, and I was grateful that my lie got me off the hook. "
I haven’t noticed a difference beyond being called “Mrs.” And some people insisting on calling me Mrs. [My Husband’s Last Name] even though that’s not my name.
"A part of me is screaming ""irresponsibility"" here.

I love going out all ""offline"", but no dead-man's switch for safety? ""I'm going here. If you don't hear from me in X days, call the Rangers."""
Jerry on Seinfeld. How he got the hottest girls in Hollywood to date pre-fame him is just laughable. Good thing it's a comedy.
"Honestly, he gives me the creeps. He just seems so slimy and shallow, I'd nope out of him in like a second."
People who are perpetual victims. It's always someone else's fault and they're never self aware that most of the time they are actually an active participant in their own misery because of the misguided way they think from a victim's stance. I can't even. 
"I think I can kind of understand where they're coming from? I tend to be a little more cautious around single men than I do men who are married/in a relationship. I worry less about ""sending mixed signals"" and having my actions misconstrued as flirting. I know married men are still capable of these things, but that's just how I see it."
"Differing needs mostly...

I hate ambient noise.  If he is going to make noise like watch a video, he must put on his headphones.  He doesn't mind noise so it's fine if I just watch whatever.

He hates when it's too cold.  So I can turn the heater up without asking but not down.  Only he can turn the heater down."

"[Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) is super fun as a two player game.  You're medical professionals who have to work together to prevent the spread of virulent diseases before they turn into a pandemic.  The rules are more complex than, say, Love Letter, but they're pretty quick to pick up.  If you don't feel like reading the rule book, there are plenty of short tutorials on youtube.

My partner and I have been playing a lot of [Pandemic Legacy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1) lately, which we've been loving.  It probably doesn't fit your criteria because the rules change as you play through the game (also, there's a bit of a time investment), but the game unfolds like a story over the course of several playthroughs.  It's amazing, and who doesn't like couples bonding by saving the world? "
"He asks me where things are before he even attempts to look for them. ""Where are my keys?"" In the bowl, where they always are. ""Where's the milk?"" In the door. That's where it's always gone. ""Did you move my phone?"" Nope, it's in your pocket.

Just *look* for things! They're right in front of your face!"
"Yep, me too. No blood, no pain. I hate that we're all led to believe there is supposed to be both those things."
"Even people who don’t consider themselves racist or prejudiced get weird when they see interracial couples. They don’t admit (even to themselves) why they don’t like it, and they make up excuses as to why “those two shouldn’t be together” but it’s racially motivated and it comes from both “sides” of the relationship. "
"Is it because he will help when you ask him to? I really like [this](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) comic ""You shouldve asked"" but I havent been game to show my partner yet."
"My husband is the same way regarding going out. Anytime he goes somewhere, I usually accompany him. He went to a basketball game like 2 months ago and does things with friends *sometimes* but we also both work from home and are around each other a LOT. My petty confession is that one time I stayed at an AirBnb and went out to eat and a movie on my own for just a night of just alone-ness"
"I had no concept of thrusting before my first time, I thought he would put it in and sit there I guess. Boy was I surprised. "
"I went on a date with a mutual friend, mostly because I was kind of pressured into it. He seemed like a nice guy, so I figured I'd just go and talk and be nice. We went on a double date to dinner and a movie. It went fine, and I was over it and ready to go home, but he (firmly) guilted me into movie hopping to stay longer. The other couple had already left, and he drove me there so I couldn't really escape. Anyway, at the beginning of the movie he kind of put his arm around me. Okay, whatever. NOPE. By the end of the movie, he had both arms around me and I was nearly sitting on his lap..

I was 17 and new to dating so I wasn't really sure how to address the problem, so afterwards I pretty much ghosted him.

Anyway, He's super religious now and regularly shares pretty racist and uber conservative stuff on Facebook.. So I guess I dodged that bullet? "
"As an older married lady (45) I think the change is my age more than my marriage. I was hit on a lot right after, probably because I was feeling so great. I don't wear a ring anymore (I hate rings and about two years ago mine disappeared, probably the cat).

I still occasionally get hit on, but generally people ignore you when you are older. It is disturbing on many levels.

"A co-worker asked me and my (now ex) husband to witness her marriage to her high school sweetheart at the courthouse. We had no idea what we were getting into! None of us had lived there that long so we didn't know the courthouse was also attached to the magistrate's office and local jail. When we walked in, there were prisoners in the waiting room, the recently arrested, drunks, homeless, screaming children, people bleeding...it was insane! We actually felt bad for them (they'd been dating all through high school and then, long distance for several years, had to be married away from family, and couldn't afford a wedding). So my husband offered to buy them dinner at a Very upscale restaurant nearby after the ceremony. It cost us half our rent for it, and we never heard from the couple again on a social level after. "
"""Too many freckles! It's just *weird*."""
"Adopted Asian, here. I am constantly the whitest asian person anybody knows and people of all races seem to think it’s fine to tell me this, repeatedly. I was shunned by other Asian kids, growing up and to be honest, a lot of the time I feel like I don’t have a “people” to associate myself with. Asians don’t share any of the same cultural experiences as I have and we don’t really “get” each other. 

So I get what you’re saying and I’m sorry to say I’m guilty of some of the stereotypes you’ve encountered. But I am really glad to read this thread And your comment so I can start to change. Thank you. "
"I got chastised the other day for talking about the cultural racism in Charleston.  I say it that was because there exists this clear socioeconomic hierarchy based on race that, while may not be viewed as racists now, is certainly due to racist policies from 20-50 years ago.

But, apparently, ""racist"" is a very harsh word that people misunderstand and think of lynching mobs, not economic and education inequality.  If I use the word ""racist"", I'm apparently accusing someone of lighting a cross on fire on someone's lawn, not supporting school segregation based on economic classes by not advocating for policies to level the playing field.

People in the south take the word ""racist"" very harshly."
That show taught me real lessons about how to behave appropriately and doesn't get the credit it deserves
"I’m from Texas and mixed race. I’ve been called a mulatto(I’m not even white), told I think I’m better than the darker kids bc I have “good hair”, been called a “black n*****r b***h by a couple old white ladies as well. I experience subtle racism more often though. "
"So happy. Much tears. Drunk the champers, giggly happy, on ya Madga, let’s get waffles for breaky."

"This is exactly what my dog does. She gives us this thoroughly disgusted look before jumping down and going into the living room. 

I much prefer this way as opposed to my old dog (this was with my ex). She’d get super excited by us having sex and would try to “join in”. She once licked my ex’s butthole and ballsack just as he was about to cum. He screamed like a little girl and jumped off the bed, spraying cum everywhere while cursing like a sailor.

I was dying of laughter the entire time. I loved that dog!"
"Lord idk if this counts, but this past summer I helped with the 5th and 6th grade kids at my church's VBS. Now I'm 16, and I was put in charge of 6 of these little people, 2 sweet girls and 4 insane boys. At one point I'm trying to keep them all in a room for some lego activity that each group has to do by themselves, and the kids aren't wanting to do it, they're just talking to each other and me and kind of hanging out so I was fine with it. This one boy though, all of a sudden turns to me and goes ""do you have a boyfriend?"" And I go ""no"" and he says ""why not"" and I said ""a lot of reasons, really just because all the circumstances I'm in lead me to just not wanting one right now"" and he goes ""that's what girls say when they want a bf but can't get one"" and I'm like kind of taken aback that this 11 year old just roasted me for not having a bf, and THEN when I tried to answer back he holds up a hand to shush me and goes ""sorry, you're just not my type"" and I go ""child, you're like 5 or 6 years younger then me, if anything you're the one who's not my type"" and he goes ""that's what they all say"" and I was just DYING at the whole thing cause it was so so funny"
"Yep, came here to say HIMYM. I actually think both Barney and Ted are completely awful, although I suppose Ted is sort of realistic if totally barf-worthy.

"Second date, we’d been out to dinner and as we walked back to our cars I asked, “So am I coming back to your place for a coffee?”

He replied with, “Actually, I’m not a coffee drinker.”

Face. Palm.

"Hang onto your butt, this one is depressing. We both had liked each other for a while, but as you said, bad timing. Neither of us was single when the other was and the only time we were was during a horrendous break up. I asked him against my better judgement because my friends were pushing. He told me I would be a rebound and deserved better.

He went to another college eventually. I started getting over it and saw someone else. He came back for a visit about a week after I went exclusive with another guy. He asked if I was seeing anyone.

I desperately wanted to say no, but said yes.

He seemed disappointed, but wished me well and said the other guy was lucky.

It was the last time I saw him alive. He died in a car accident a few years later. At least I got to attend his funeral.

He's been dead for 14 years now and it still feels weird sometimes. I really wish he was just somewhere else, living his life without me."
"The dog is puritanical when it comes to sex. If we start when she's on the bed, she looks at us with great disgust and leaves of her own accord. Otherwise we'd just ignore her. She's small and easy to ignore. "
"Yeah no I 1000% would have had a fling with Joey. (And, for the record, married Chandler and killed Ross.)"
"In my experience it only works when both people are “fighting” for it... which means working hard together, compassion, commitment, curiosity and patience."
"Consider the fact that everyone around you has a rich life that you know nothing about.  The girl you think is hot has a mom and a dad and siblings who love her for who she is and would be appalled to know some jackass at a bar is trying his hardest to fuck her tonight.  Listen when women talk to you, actually listen, that pretty girl is probably more than just her looks. 

Pay attention to other humans, you are probably in the midst of one, of MANY, existential crises; so is someone else in the room, you aren't special.  Just...do the things you know are the right things to do. "
"This was my ex-boyfriend. The best way to summarize my experience was...I wasn't so much a person to him as I was a living ""manic pixie dream girl"" / photo prop. "

"I have very tight hip tendons, which won't always allow my legs to move into the positions required for penile-vaginal intercourse unless I first stretch them to the point where they make a loud cracking/poping noise. I think it's called snapping hip syndrome."
"I have a coworker that I think is on the receiving end of this stereotype at work. She and I started in the same position on the same week. We have the same level of experience in the company prior to that, and the same level of education. We also have pretty similar ""no bullshit"" personalities. 

The only major difference between us is that she's black and I'm white, but I constantly hear our supervisor and others on our team claiming that she's ""rude"" or has a ""bad attitude"" etc. I stand up for her whenever I have the opportunity, but its exhausting for me so I can only imagine how frustrated she is with the situation."
I believe that these sex and pedophile scandals are real but have been going on for a long time. The fact that this is news makes me think that they are a red herring distracting me from something bigger going on.
"He is not allowed to tickle me. But it's fine when I do it to him.

"When I was in first grade a kid in my class thought the same thing, so the teacher explained to us that the mom isn't kissing Santa, it's just the boys dad dressed as Santa, since Santa isn't real. Cue class full of crying 6 year olds."
"I went out with a guy from Bumble. He was really quiet and awkward at dinner. I had to generate all the conversation, he spoke really quietly, and he just generally seemed spacey. 

After dinner, he asked me to go get drinks and I accepted because I felt bad that he was so quiet and awkward. When we got to the bar, he was suddenly all over me. Kept pulling me closer to him and kissing my forehead and then trying to make out with me. I’m really non confrontational and pretty inexperienced with dating, so I just let him even though I really didn’t want to. 

I stayed there for a little over an hour because I felt bad leaving and just tolerated it. He insisted on walking me to my car. Then he asked if he could kiss me goodnight and I said okay because I felt bad saying no. I thought it was just going to be a small kiss but no. I finally pulled away and said I had to go. 

It was so uncomfortable and showed me how bad I am at dating and keeping boundaries. "
"He jokes about my hair getting everywhere but is seemingly oblivious to the fact that when he shaves or trims his beard, the clippings end up *all* over the bathroom. They're on the sink, behind the tap, on the shelf with the toiletries, somehow on the toilet - behind the seat hinge, they're stuck to both sides of the shower curtain. And this is after he's rinsed them away... "
"I'm not really sure. It was the first and only time I've ever cheated. I'm not sure why I felt compelled to do it at the time, or why the consequences or feelings of my boyfriend didn't matter to me at the time. "
"Ugh, that last one.   Really sums up my dating life though.  I show up in cute, well fitted outfits and straight out of a shower and they show up in chunky, worn sneakers,  dad jeans and a random.sports shirts.

"
"Right? The main reason I've never watched much TOS is I find it actively disturbing that I'm attracted to Shatner. I grew up with tubby old weirdo Shatner, and the first time I saw an episode of TOS in college my reaction was ""Woah, hey, this is not fair!"""
I see you're on Team Jacob
"That there is no farm in the country where they send dogs. When I was a kid all I knew about farms was that they had a lot of animals including a lot of dogs. So when our first dog was put down my mom told me she went to live on a farm in the country. I think she even dropped a name like ""relative I knew lived in the country's neighbor"". It made sense. That's why farms have so many dogs. It was until I was in high school that I realized that the dog was put down and that I'd been gotten by one of the biggest tropes. "
"Svly is *the worst* boyfriend. He's a whiner, he's selfish, he monopolizes every moment, a common theme with both Annie and his ex-wives is bad sex and not his lack of ability to please them but their failings to be pleased by him. Proposes to her to try to lure her away from her new boyfriend. Writes a fucking play just to change the ending and soothe his bruised ego. He doesn't want to be a partner. He wants someone to play a weird mother role for him while also fucking him.

The worst part is it's so obvious that Allen is just playing himself. Even before I knew what a creeper he was, that was the movie that made me think something is deeply wrong with that guy."
"Compared to men's clothing, everything is made so cheap and thin!  I try to find some nice cozy sweatpants and I have to go to the men's section because I feel like they just don't exist for women. And there is always a graphic tee section for men, but I never find one for women. If I do, it's all thin, cheap, and low cut. "
"I slept with a girl in a committed long-term relationship to allow her to explore her bi-curious side. A couple of months later I went to a concert with her boyfriend and slept with him as well. I am all but certain that neither of them know what I did with the other, and neither would be okay with it if they found out. Drugs played a part both times, but it's really no excuse.

I also worked as an au pair for a while and had a sugar daddy/sugar baby thing going on with the father of the child. Not sure if his wife knew or not. They always seemed very open in their relationship and I knew they'd been swinging before, but it was still extremely fucked up.

"Oh my god. I already can't handle my partner not cluing me in on his day. I think if he just up and went wherever without telling me, I would feel abandoned."
I hated Kirito from Sword Art Online for this. The whole anime sucked because of his stupid harem when he's just a normal boy who is only super strong in a damn videogame. 
"For me, that was normal behavior thanks to my father. After being out of that environment and away from exes who behaved that way, it's a lot easier to see just how unacceptable that is. In my experience, it came paired with emotional abuse, which is hard to see when it's been normalized from childhood."
"I can only speak for myself here but:

Attempting to attract women on dating sites/apps with photos of their car in their profile. As if I’m going to choose a guy because of his car. It has the opposite effect on me and instantly turns me off if they have a photo of their car."
I cringed. I'm sorry.  
I know someone who let her former husband make her daughter eat in her room for all meals. I have never looked at this person the same. She did eventually get some sense though and divorced him but by then the damage was done.
And we’ve found the person with high self-esteem. 
"That sex is all about his penis.

That all women shout accept anal, or cum on their body/in their mouth--urgh!

"Yeeup, I used to work with a guy like this. He thought he was super duper woke and seemed really fixated on being pansexual (especially after I mention that I was).

He would just say weird shit that *sounded* deep but was pretty shallow when you stopped to think about it. The worst one was probably when he mentioned that he knew he wanted to marry a guy but kept dating girls.

He also viewed being homeless as an aesthetic lifestyle choice and would brag about all the hard shit he had to deal with. His parents hand't kicked him out or anything, he just chose to live like that."
"I eat peanut butter with a spoon straight from the jar.

Isn't this exactly why we say children *can't* consent? You were a child. I get you were 16 when you did it and that's probably legal enough in many u.s states (I've no idea). But that's fucked up on his part. He's a pervy asshole who preyed on children and underage girls.

"Sex = Love

I fully expected my first time to be with someone I loved who also loved me. Like someone I was engaged to.  Instead it was my first boyfriend, after dating for 2 months, and he raped me."
Dropping hints with my current partner doesn’t work. Getting naked and then taking his clothes off and climbing on top of him usually gets the message across. ;)

"My sister's. No alcohol, no dancing, bad food. Thirty minute afternoon ceremony followed by a buffet of cold, chewy bacon, scrambled eggs that clearly came from a box, and lukewarm cardboard-tasting pancakes. The only ""dancing"" was when she forced everyone to do the chicken dance. So awkward. "
"I always get ""but I DID clean it up. You're making it up!"" ????? He'll usually trim his beard before i wake up. If you cleaned it up why am I texting you about the mess after you're gone? If it was cleaned up I wouldn't actually know it was there.."
"He doesn't mind me waking him up on the weekends if he's slept in for several hours.

He will never wake me unless he thinks I'm supposed to be in the office and have overslept. I sleep so poorly/rarely that once it's happening, it is a Glorious Event Never To Be Interrupted."

"I work at a gas station and one of our delivery asked me for my phone number. I had just recently moved back to town after being gone for 2 years and was trying to build a relationship with my children and just didn't have room for any dating. I told him kindly that I wasn't dating and he acted weird towards me every time he came into the store.

 One day one of my friends was in and I would describe him as a big friendly Uncle type (although he's not my uncle) my friend was leaving and I went to give him a hug. My co-worker came in saw it and wanted to know who that was. I told him it was my uncle, although it's really none of his business, and he proceeded to tell me how he knows how it is ""how girls like me are. We  turn down nice guys like him and then the next derelict that comes along gets  right up in her pants"" 

 I work in a gas station and everybody in the whole store heard this. Yes, I told my supervisor and funny enough he no longer delivers on my shift. "
"This is purely anecdotal and comes only from my own personal experience: 

I lived in a rural town in Tennessee for a few years, then moved to Boston for college. I personally witnessed a little more racism in Boston than in Tennessee. In Tennessee I saw a lot of confederate flags and heard the ""states rights"" arguments, but it seemed like a lot of the outwardly racist comments and behaviors came primarily from older members of the town (50yrs+). Most of the hostility I witnessed was against the North (""uppity yankees who think we're all stupid""), and against Mexicans (""stealing our jobs"") than against black people. 

In Boston, I heard a lot about Southerners (""ignorant religious idiots who are all racist and want slaves even today""), a lot about muslims (including non-muslim but vaguely middle-eastern looking people; ""terrorists,"" ""religious fanatics,"" ""going to blow us all up,"" etc), some about mexicans (""stealing our jobs""), and surprisingly enough, some about poor black people (""living in the ghetto""). Well-to-do black people were fine, catholic people were fine (the irish catholic culture there is prevalent), but protestant, poor, or middle-eastern? Not so fine. These comments came from people my age, as well as older. 

I can't speak as to the reasons behind this. Perhaps it has to do with the generalization that the North can be more ""blunt"" and ""outspoken"" while the South can be more concerned with ""saving face"" and  ""social niceties.""  Maybe the amount of prejudice is the same, but was expressed more clearly to me in one area than the other. Maybe it's to do with the people specifically around me - although these were all casual acquaintances, as I'm not drawn toward deep friendship with people who hold this kind of prejudice. 

All of the places I have lived (in the US and abroad) feature prejudice and racism - but more often than not, I have found it has to do with socioeconomic class than actual skin color. "
"Phones listen to you talking and they generate ads based on what you’re talking about. I definitely also believe that they’re reading text messages, but listening to us talking is creepier to me. "

I was talking with this guy who didn't realize anal penetration required preparation and lubrication. He thought you could just push in. 
"Colors are always feminine. Women's cut flannel shirt? Pink, purple, or teal. Or how about a nice red BUT we've added a sparkly metallic stripe to let everyone know you're not *too* masculine?

Built-in bras in tank tops (my boobs are too big for them). And button down shirts (my boobs need a size large to button across the bust, but a size small in the waist to appear fitted and those do not exist). Same for cardigans."
"The fact that we are supposed to speak and act a certain way. The amount of times I’ve been called oreo just for the way I speak is disheartening. No, I’m not white on the inside thanks."
Right! Like I have never been asked out on an elevator or in the grocery store. Just 90s TV lies.

"I feel like Ross and Rachel weren’t that compatible even if they were a realistic depiction of a very lust oriented relationship. Like what are they going to talk about in five years time? They don’t like any of the same things. They refuse to learn even the basics of each other’s passions.

In conclusion, I watch Friends too much. "
"My brother's. He's religious (we grew up in a very religious household, but now the majority of my siblings are atheist).

It was on new years eve (don't have weddings on holidays!!)

No alcohol

Ceremony was long

This was his second marriage, and it was in the same church as last time

The new wife (who I love, don't get me wrong) gave a speech about how excited she was to be my nieces and nephews Mom...like she was replacing their actual Mom. So awkward.

It was an evening wedding so there was no dinner, just dessert. A giant table of desserts, and that was it. So if you're not a big sweet-tooth then it was less than ideal.

I'm 99% sure that they didn't have sex leading up to this marriage, so there was LOTS of kissing (aka making out in front of everyone). 

They did their first dance on a stage with everyone sitting in their seats watching them. They also would make out every once in a while during the dance.....again, with everyone seated and watching them.

And last but not least, the dance was a Christian rock band 😒"
"I think a good percentage of the issues men have that are caused by porn can be summed up by saying that basically, it makes them believe that vaginas pretty much don't feel pain or discomfort. Like anything you do to it must feel good because it's ""made for fucking."" Like... that's the underlying issue behind 90% of it, is they genuinely appear to not understand that the default for vaginal activity is at best neutral and at worst uncomfortable -- not wild animalistic pleasure."
"No. I think the person you marry should be ""safe."" Not safe as in boring or for the sake of marriage, but a person you're confident meets your needs, who makes you feel secure, and who you know is a compatible and worthy partner. That's what safe is to me."
I think you still just call that one Ticket to Ride 
She tried to open a jar (of pickles?) I think.
Might I ask why you did it?

"Never being available to hang out when sex wasn't on the menu. During shark week or when I invited him to less sexy events like brunch with friends, he somehow mysteriously had too much work/studying/a bad cough. Turns out that was his special time for getting high and banging other girls."

"Being told what to do. 

I know some women -- smart women, sharp women -- who seem to think that being told what to do by a man means he loves her. ""If he didn't care, he wouldn't tell me what to wear or what to order for dinner. He's just looking out for me!"" 

Meanwhile, I used to get huffy when my then-boyfriend would call me to tell me to turn my TV to HBO: ""Uh, I'm busy, dude, why don't you let me know what you think I should watch and *ask* me?"" (He learned to ask, I learned to be less stiff-necked, and we're married now.) 

Blows my mind when partners are not only okay with being told what to do but actually consider it a positive event. "

I was friends with one of my coworkers. He was funny but I had no interest in dating him at all. I honestly would never have dreamed that he would ever misinterpret our conversations as flirting but that's exactly what happened. He started trying to touch me and I finally realized what was up. I told him that I wasn't interested in him due to his age (he's 20 years older) and the fact that we work together. He told me that he was going to die alone and that no woman ever showed him any affection even though he's a great guy. He eventually got desperate and clingy and started texting me porn gifs. I finally had to block his number and pretend he doesn't exist. A month on and he still glares at me like all this is my fault
"I hate that so many things are backless nowadays. I get so disappointed when I see a cute shirt/dress in a store, then realize it's backless. I'd either have to go braless, which is painful for me, or let the whole back of my bra show, which I think looks sloppy. Can't wait for that trend to die. "

"Frank on Shameless.  He's currently getting with rich, beautiful women from his son's private school - supposedly because he's more manly what with a real job and knowing how to use his hands.

"My husband and I decided to start watching the series from the beginning. I don't understand the appeal of Ross AT ALL. God he's so annoying! But so is Rachel, so I guess that explains the coupling. Chandler has this self-depreciating awkwardness that can be charming at least and his character has more of a growth arc. 

But yeah, out of all of the Friends, Ross is the worst. We had to take a break from the show because it was just too mind-numbing. "
"Yes. I live in South Carolina and teach in a majority black school. A white woman I work with is getting married to a black man. The kids, especially the girls, talk about her behind her back. One of the girls is related to the fiance, and will be attending the wedding. They talk about how the whole family thinks it's wrong for the fiance to be marrying my coworker, how he could have found a nice black woman. I overheard them saying that an auntie was angry about white women stealing all of the good, educated black men that *""should""* be marrying black women to elevate the community.

I also have a white male student who is dating a black female student who I do not have in class. The kids joke about them, telling my student that he only likes her for her butt, that he wants to be black, picking out white girls and asking him if he wouldn't rather date them, etc.

It's sad."

"&gt; if you’re buying heels that are less than $80 or so (depending on where you live, of course), they’re probably going to hurt.


Weirdly enough, it wasn't until I started buying very cheap heels that I finally found really comfortable ones.


The few times I broke the bank on nicer, $100-plus heels at Nordstrom, Hudson's Bay, shoe shops, etc. I could never stand to wear them for more than an hour or two. Just excruciating foot pain. Same with nice vintage heels. Eventually I ended up with a few pairs of heels that I never wore more than once, and zero pairs of heels that I could actually use for work, events, etc.


Then, in I started buying heels at Payless Shoes, and WOW are they ever comfy! Because Payless targets lower-income shoppers, they tend to carry a lot of brands that are made for waitresses, flight attendants, etc. -- jobs where you're on your feet a lot. These heels are usually marketed as ""comfort heels"" and usually have some word like ""comfort"", ""soft"", or ""cloud"" in their brand name. They often have ankle straps, mary-jane straps, etc. that help reduce ankle strain, and 2-4"" heels that are slightly thicker than a fashion stiletto for improved stability. Cheap flashy party heels are absolutely going to be uncomfortable, but I've found that cheap comfort/work heels are THE BEST."
"After I interviewed for my current position, my supervisor called to say there was a mixup and they'd only approved one position instead of two, and someone else had been hired.

She then followed that up saying that she'd decided to bring me onto her team anyway, at the same salary, but in a position where I'd learn a variety of skills instead of specializing *and* I'd be working from home."

"Most ridiculous: ""I understand why your ex left you. You're clingy and crazy. You come off like a stalker."" - ""friend"" said literally a week after my ex dumped me after a two and a half year relationship. Looking back, it's really funny now because he tried to take advantage of my vulnerability and got pissed when that didn't work.

Funniest: ""Are you sure you're Black because Black girls are ugly. You must be Brazilian or something."""
I'm gonna have to disagree on this one. That smile will instantly drop my panties. 
"They are each different. 


I've only met one MGTOW. His entire existence at the party was complaining about women or telling women to get him drinks. 


I've met a few red pillers. They come off as douchebros who act over confident and pretend to be pick up artists, but 98% of women avoid them because holy shit it's hard to pretend you are shining like gold as a piece of human trash.


Incels are harder. You can't be talking to them directly to see it, you have to be like a BBC camera crew, watching silently. They sneer at women and talk under their breath. The ogle at women and are normally very creepy. If you talk to them they can pretend to be just a normal socially awkward person rather than a truly hate filled warped individual. "
"When he talks shit about other women in your presence. As if to signal that you're somehow the exception, but in reality he just comes off as a misogynist."
"I shave the edges around where hair would poke out of my underwear, shave around my anus, and then trim up everything else to about a centimeter long. It's just to make it look more neat. I occasionally shave in shapes with stencils when I wanna jazz things up

My pubic hair makes me feel more womanly so I don't shave it off but I don't like having a full bush either. I've found what works for me."
"He was climbing into my bed to watch a movie and I said, “Aren’t those jeans uncomfortable? Maybe you should take them off?”

He was like, “Oh nah these jeans are actually really comfy! You can sleep in ‘em!”

Okay then.

I think he did realize what I was getting at, though, because next time we met, I was at his house and he was really laying the sexual flirting on thick 😂"
"I thought the opposite, I thought they could stay hard after sex for a while. led to a lot of disappointment tbh. :/ I hate the awkward waiting period in between...rounds?"

That does nothing to make her or Jerry look good in this situation. She probably couldn't say anything bad about him publicly so that could be a factor for what she said but still it's fucked

"But Edward isn't a ladies' man? Pretty sure the book describes him as a moody, cynical, emo teenager before he met Bella. Even the Cullens thought Edward was hopeless in the women department, because he just didn't seem interested in girls or women at all.

Case in point, Carlisle, Edward's ""father"", originally turned Rosalie into a vampire with the hopes that she would be Edward's mate. Rosalie is always depicted in the series as the Aphrodite of the Cullens - beautiful, model-esque, and blonde. 

Yet it's also stated that Edward had zero interest in her romantically or sexually. "
