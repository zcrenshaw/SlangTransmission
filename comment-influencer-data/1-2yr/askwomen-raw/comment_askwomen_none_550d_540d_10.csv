"One of my friends, who was 23, started bawling in the middle of my very tame bachelorette party because my maid of honor surprised us with a game called “Pin the Junk on the Hunk.”  It was pin the tail on the donkey, but naked and not a donkey. 

Anyway, she started bawling and finally managed to say, “I just always thought the first penis I would ever see would be my husband’s on our wedding night.”  We were all surprised since, well, we couldn’t imagine how she’d done anatomy, health, etc without seeing even a “here’s a view of male genitalia” picture in a textbook.  

The game’s “penises” were cartoon jokes (I.e: a bat and two baseballs, a snake popping out of trousers, a hot dog with two paper cups of ketchup and mustard, etc).  There weren’t any that really looked like penises.  She still refused to play and just glared at us like we were committing a sin.   Once the penis cake came out (shout out to my MOH for writing “to have and to hold” on it), she suddenly developed a raging headache and had to leave.

I still kind of feel bad for her because she had a rough night."
"That it doesn't matter how cheap something is if you cannot afford it. I used to have this argument with a partner all the time. Yes, I know the bus is only a few dollars. But I literally did not have a few dollars to spare. It seems to be a really hard concept to grasp for a lot of people. Also what being broke really means. If they say that they're broke this week/fortnight/month, they mean they maybe can't afford to go out to dinner and a movie after all their bills are paid. If my parents said it, it meant we're having toast  for dinner again because a loaf of bread is cheap, and the bills are still due from last month. "
"Quentin Tarantino made a scene at a diner in New York when the waitress dropped off his bill because he didn't have his wallet on him. He asked if she knew who he was, and whether she knew that he did not in fact pay to eat there because he was Quentin Fucking Tarantino and New York is HIS CITY. Another diner finally paid his bill because he liked Tarantino's movies and wanted to finish his breakfast in peace; that was my clearest example of how ubiquitous famous people are in NYC and how nobody's impressed who you are if you're a jerk. "
"""Oh my got, there were LESBIANS at our school""

fuck me, Sara, you're 38. There were 1800 people at our school. Yes, there were lesbians there.  And gay boys. And  probably a couple of future paedophiles and statistically, a fraction of a murderer."
"A lot of people say saying ""I love you"" too much weakens the meaning. My SO and I say fuck that and literally shower each other with love and affection every day, and it is no less meaningful the 500th time we've said it. "
"Not while on my period, but while I was on fertility meds: 
Asked husband if he were offered $1 million to sleep with another woman would he do it. He immediately said no and that he loved me. Burst into tears because (exact quote in between sobs): ""you don't care about our financial security"". 

We laugh about it now but no answer would have been the right answer that day. Hormones are no joke. "
"I grew up extremely poor, and struggled hard into my mid 20's and went without so much when I was on my own. I would wear the same clothes until they were falling apart, I had to make my own menstrual pads, wash my clothes in the tub because I couldn't afford to use the coin laundry in my apartment building. I lived on black coffee, tap water, oatmeal, and rice. Sometimes I was so hungry I would cry and I'm ashamed to say that I stole food from my job a few times. It would get so cold in my apartment during a cold snap you could see your breath, I couldn't afford to run the heat high. I worked 40-50 hours a week, but I had to commute over an hour to get to my work sites and gas wasn't reimbursed. It was the only job I could find, and after gas and toll expenses I had about 800$ a month for everything. It was absolutely soul crushing. 

However, I am grateful for that time in my life. It's made me appreciate the smallest things. Right now I'm thankful for the creamer in my coffee this morning, for my laundered bedsheets, my coat without holes, my warm bedroom, the food in the kitchen. You never really know how important things like that are unless you've been without them. "
"A very intelligent woman I work with implied that her stepdaughter's breasts were large because she is hooking up with guys.  

Edit: hey, y'all? ""You should tell her it's the inverse"" is....kind of not a great sentiment, if you dissect it. Whether you insinuate the boobs came from her behavior or that she behaves a certain way because of the boobs, it's making assumptions about someone's (in this case, a child's) sexual experiences based on something they can't control. Let's maybe back off that, ok? 

The joke's slightly less funny if you imagine that young girl hearing you tell it. "
"I gotta shout out my husband here for calling out the misogyny he hears from other men.

We switched to a new tax guy one year who just had to comment on the fact that my name was first on our prior year’s returns. “Doesn’t that bother you, man? Your wife’s the primary filer?” And my husband is like... uh no? Should it? Do we get a fatter refund if the man’s name comes first? She makes more than me; do we get a different rate if the primary filer has a lower income?? Literally made the tax dude explain WHY he would comment on the name order as if it was professional advice. Bless him. "
"I dislike how common and socially acceptable ghosting has become. It takes 2 seconds to send a polite, concise text expressing that you don’t see things going any further. It can be literally one sentence. Just be a mature adult and don’t fall off the face of the earth without an explanation. "
"We were trying to tell her how not everyone can afford to get lasik, her response was ""well just get a credit card!""
I don't think she understood they'd still have to pay and with credit card there would be interest included if it's not paid off fast enough."
Last month I cried because I loved tortellini so much 
"Attended the funeral of a close family friend, an older man said he wanted a warm drink so I offered to get him a cup of tea or coffee. As I walked away he said ""train them while they're young"" to the person next to him, (I was about 16/17). I turned around and said he could get it himself. He then made a comment about me being on my period. Arses gonna be arses no matter where they are or the circumstances. Really miss that family friend. "
"The salesman at the tire store, who wasn't even some old guy from a different generation, he was like 35, said to me, ""Do you want to call your husband before you get these tires changed and make sure it's ok?""

I said, ""I don't have a husband and I think that's a very odd thing to say to a woman in 2016.""

He was _extremely_ embarrassed and the rest of our interaction was awkward as fuck.  To his credit, he'll probably never say something like that again."
"""If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best."""
I am the money maker. He does have a good job but the work is seasonal. I'm perfectly happy if he wants to stay home and take care of the kids while I work. 
"he is the one person i can take with me to the woods. referencing this poem by mary oliver 

*Ordinarily, I go to the woods alone, with not a single*

*friend, for they are all smilers and talkers and therefore*

*unsuitable.*


*I don’t really want to be witnessed talking to the catbirds* 

*or hugging the old black oak tree. I have my way of*

*praying, as you no doubt have yours.*


*Besides, when I am alone I can become invisible. I can sit*

*on the top of a dune as motionless as an uprise of weeds,*

*until the foxes run by unconcerned. I can hear the almost*

*unhearable sound of the roses singing.*


*If you have ever gone to the woods with me, I must love*

*you very much.*"
"I currently am a stay at home mom, but we have this weird silent agreement where when we go out in public with the baby he is the care giver 98% of the time. It's mostly to give me a break, but he also loves how pissy looking the older generations get when they see him and not me. "
"""I don't understand, why would you want someone to hit you?"" - My mom after her friends made her see 50 Shades with them

""Did you know they make fake penises for lesbians to wear and use during sex?? Why??"" - Also my mom"
"""Love will keep us together.""    
No it won't - you need commitment, shared values, sacrifice, loyalty, so much more than just love.  "
"we do this too and our children observe it and also do it.  i work as a crossing guard on my son's school route (grade one) today he zoomed past me on his scooter and yelled ""i love you to infinity mom!"", it made me so happy.  the days are coming when he'll be embarrassed.  BUT THAT DAY WAS NOT THIS DAY. "
"I ended up with an unplanned C section. Everything I read and everyone I talked to, no one mentioned the absolutely bizarre feeling of C section drugs; I felt like my body was freezing from the inside out, like my veins were made of ice. I also was shaking but that was mentioned.

No one mentioned that my husband might be able to see over the drape and therefore, see them cutting into me.

And after birth, a lot of women I spoke to never breast fed, and all of the books I read mentioned how it shouldn’t hurt and made it seem like a mystical experience with a line about talking to lactation counselors. My nipples were cracked and bleeding and sore and every time he latched, I wanted to scream. Lactation counselor I saw was useless. It got better but I would have loved a pamphlet that said “Breastfeeding: A story of excruciating nipple pain with blood.” "
"Having the first date/intial meeting be cuddling or meeting up at someone's place. Like... No meet me in public &amp; don't get upset about me not wanting to come over immediately after

Not to shit on anyone who does this but I am entirely too anxious to be alone in private with a stranger. Especially having them know where I live so soon after meeting"
"Started talking to a girl at a bar and noticed she had a necklace with a key on it. She told me it was a gift from her dad that was a piece of history. She then explained to me how, back in the day, people used to use keys to open the doors of their houses while I tried my very best to keep a straight face. It turned out that she lived in a super-rich gated community that used key cards to open the doors to their houses and she had apparently never seen a key before."
"I work with celebrities and have met dozens and dozens. 

I hate to say that Bill Nye was the rudest. He was a jerk all three times I worked with him,  so I couldn't brush it off as him having a bad day.  "
"the way food was treated as a precious resource. there was never enough to eat at meals, so we had to fight for extra portions. one of my parents often lied about not being hungry so that there was enough for the kids.

also eating between meals was a punishable offense. it was hard at times because we were always so goddamn hungry. the food was bought by the parents and belonged to them. though strangely, even eating at a neighbour's house was similarly punished. maybe because it threatened their feeling of being able to provide.

a lot of people who aren't poor also don't understand that home owners can live with absolutely horrid conditions in their house, because they managed to save enough to buy but don't earn enough to maintain. as one example, our sewer system was busted and we could only flush the toilet a couple of times a day, and took water from baths/showers outside in buckets because it could not go down. it would cost too much to be fixed in their lifetime. our neighbours sewage drained onto their lawn, and we all DIYed our laundry machines to drain in the street.

this is the reason why i have zero problem renting. at least it's guaranteed i never have to live in abysmal conditions due to not having money for repairs."
"The expectation of anal...? Like, I’m definitely not a prude and I understand that many women enjoy it. But this idea that all women (or at least me) want to get down like that is bizarre...

Like damn dude, can I learn your last name first? "
"For me, there’s this issue with food. We were so poor and we never had fresh fruit or vegetables. Everything was cheap and unhealthy and I struggle with enjoying the taste of the healthy meals my husband makes because I never had that kind of stuff growing up. We had so many high sugar/carb foods and those are the things I crave. "
When I was pregnant a male co-worker said “so you can’t have sex again until the baby is born “.  I asked why and he said “because the baby is in your vagina”. I got out an anatomy book and showed him.  He wasn’t sure he believed me so he asked another woman in our department and since she corroborated my story he decided it must be true

Jared Leto. Watched him be a shithead to fans and make a few actually leave in tears.
"you find yourself constantly worrying about how they feel, if they're having a good time, and you're hyper-aware of any indications they give that everything isn't going their way. 

they ''hold the environment hostage'' with passive aggression until they bring down the mood of the group/room/party/home to their level and solicit caretaking so everyone can have fun or just plain exist again. how they feel and their pain is not their responsibility, it's others."
Fifteen. Got my first kiss from a nice boy I liked.
"Husband and I have separate bedrooms. We're very happy married and love spending time together, but he snores and flops while I hog the bed and steal covers. Well rested spouses make for happy spouses.

Also, we don't want kids."
"My parents were looking into braces for my sister, who was probably... 12? 14? at the time. They visited one orthodontist who suggested a lot of extreme-sounding (and expensive) oral surgery and orthodontia. My dad asked a lot of questions about why all that work would be necessary rather than a more standard course of braces. Rather than answering his questions, however, the [male] orthodontist replied, ""What, you don't want to spend money on her? You want her husband to have to pay for it instead?""

They marched right out of that office and eventually took her (and, ultimately, my brother and me as well) to another, far less assholey orthodontist, who, incidentally, was a woman. BOY BYE."
"His full name. I have a consistent naming policy for my phone contacts. Everyone needs a first and last name, capitalised correctly."
"Vince Vaughn. I was in this farmers market/restaurant once in Cali. I was on vacation with my family and my camera's memory was getting full so while we sat and ate i went through my photo's to delete what I could. Next thing I know, someone from across the place is yelling. I look up and he is waving my way and yelling at me to put the camera way. Roughly saying (and not nicely) ""Put the fucking camera away! what are you doing? can't I have some damn privacy?"" I think he called me something too but I didn't really hear him. I didn't know he was there, the camera wasn't facing him, the lens cap wasn't even off. Also I was 12 and had no idea who he even was until my sister told me. "
"My mom is a high earner and feels super guilty about it. She has a master's degree and built her own business post-divorce, but believes that only men should work and women should maintain the house and ""allow"" men to provide. ^(This makes me want to rip out my hair)"
"I tear up at... everything... when I'm PMSing/on my period. Like, I just wasted 15 minutes watching youtube videos of the largest waves ever caught on film and started tearing up thinking about how powerful and amazing the ocean is. So yeah, I'm one of those.  "
"I work overseas and I was helping out a colleague move in to her new apartment.  She had just moved from my home country to join the organization. I was helping her move some boxes, and after we were done, she said she needed some other help.  She led me to the washing machine, and asked ‘What does this do?’ Did the same thing with the stove. 

Thought she was joking, turns out she really wasn’t. "
"My band opened up for Bret Michaels a couple years ago. We had to sell our own tickets to the show; minimum of 50 tickets at **$50 each!**, AND they were running a Groupon for it at the same time. I would never expect anyone I know to pay $50 to see me play, and I don't know any Bret Michaels fans, but we somehow managed to pull off the ticket sales quota. We were told that Bret didn't want us backstage when he arrived; he was selling additional meet &amp; greet packages for $200 and didn't want anyone who didn't pay to see him up close, even though we sold $2500 worth of tickets for him. After we played, we were told we had five minutes to get our shit from backstage or else they would throw it out on the sidewalk. Fuck Bret Michaels and his shitty management. "
"Because we need different things from a friend than we need from a romantic partner. For example, I would prefer to have more interests in common with a friend than a partner, and need my partner to have the same values as me, whereas congruent values is less important for me with a friend. 

Furthermore, maybe someone loves the party animal friend who always has a joke and great stories. But there are many people who would struggle to be romantically involved with the party animal. "
"I delivered a pizza to the Eurythmics in Tucson, somewhere around 1983. Instead of a tip, they said I would have tickets at will call for the show on the following night. There were no tickets for the show at will call for me the following night. Apparently this was their 'thing' and were somewhat known for it. "
"Not being able to ""just go to a doctor"" when you have a serious medical issue. Having to save up money for months to be able to afford clothes that fit. Running out of menstrual pads/toilet paper and trying to make it work with napkins/paper towels. "
"Chevy Chase was really rude but he's famous for that. I've also seen Nicki Minaj poison a whole room with her attitude and that was after Mariah Carey glid (she doesn't walk, she glides) through the room refusing to look at anyone she thought was beneath her, which, news flash, is everyone. 

Also, Tobey Maguire for some reason. He's a straight up psychopath."
"I hate that nowadays women are pressured to be the ""cool girl"" who doesn't expect commitment, exclusivity, or decent communication lest she be labeled ""crazy"" or ""clingy""."
That human trafficking doesn't occur in Canada... And that women's bodies don't change during/after pregnancy. Both from the same person.
"Probably about 10. My cousin and I (also 10) were walking back from the beach to our family's cottage (we were not in swim suits). A car with 4 older guys stopped by us and tried talking to us, we kept walking and they followed. So we went into a convenience store (the only store) the guys parked outside the store. We used the convenience store's telephone and called our grandmother to pick us up. 

Our cottage was in the forest, just around the corner from the store. Our grandmother picked us up. The guys followed and parked at the side of the road at the entrance to our cottage property. 

Luckily my crazy uncle (cousin's father) was there and went out to the guys in the car, with his hunting shotgun, to ""inquire"" why they were there. 

They left pretty quickly. 

But it was since then that I noticed the honking, the yelling, the staring. I never understood what guys or men thought they would accomplish by yelling out their windows as they drive past?"

"This is....wild. I saw dicks multiple times before even entering middle school just because kids are naked sometimes. And then sex ed had images, movies had images, etc...it really didn't take any special effort for me to have already seen both real and images of penises way before I was sexually active. Wanting to avoid an image or even a cartoon reference to an image so badly seems insane. What happens when she sees it on her wedding night and can't deal?"

"An old roommate who was very much a mama’s boy (19, at the time) once cried to me and another roommate that he was still a virgin and he’d do anything to be able to suck on a woman’s breasts because he wanted to taste the milk when they orgasmed. 

Took this opportunity to convince him that black women produce chocolate milk. And he believed that shit for as long as I knew him. "
"the feeling that if you have a single nice thing at all(whether it be a computer, ice cream, new clothes, an air conditioner, anything at all) that you have to justify why you have said thing. *especially* if you receive any form of gov. assistance.



also, there's a culture of shame around being a poor kid. it's especially apparent when you're a poor kid in an upper middle class school. i attended a public charter middle school and i will never forget the time when this one girl said to me ""they should have made this a private school and made people pay to get in, that way only the smart people would be here"". it's relevant that she routinely got 70s on a test literally everyone else in the class got 99s on. she did this kind of thing in every class when she didn't get a grade she wanted. and she claimed she wasn't rich cuz her parents didn't let her shop at abercrombie. i doubt she'd even remember saying that.



just in general people tend to hate the poor having anything at all, whether it be actual items or opportunities. the same idea is behind why trump is trying to have people on food stamps get a box of military meals instead of being able to go to the store themselves. poverty is seen as a punishment for something the person must have done wrong, and if the person has anything that might let up the misery even slightly, it isn't allowed"
"Oh man I had a buddy in college that believed credit cards were free money. He legitimately didn't realize that his parents paid his credit card off every month and thought that credit card balances just disappeared at the end of the month. Super smart guy otherwise, but he had a major blind spot when it came to how real life finances work. Guess that's what happens when mom and dad take care of everything and you never have to manage finances on your own. "
"The mother of a newly married, previously home-schooled woman told her daughter that birth control is really just a small abortion pill and that she shouldn’t use it.
3 months into her new marriage, she found herself living in her in-laws basement, no job, no car, barely able to afford groceries, and two months pregnant."
"My sister in law is getting married in the Dominican Republic in November. When they first announced it we were saying that we don't know how/if we can afford to go and her fiance said ""just save $100 a month and you'll have plenty by the time it gets here."" Which of our bills would you like us to not pay to save that $100 a month?"
"""Happy wife, happy life"". This one just rots me. I feel like it plays into the tired old jokes about a nagging wife ruining her husband's life. And it feels really patronizing. I don't think it is a typical reaction to that saying, though, so I just kind of accept that most people don't find this one grating and might even like it. It's just like nails on a chalkboard to me for some reason."
Its ok most of us don't pay for his movies. 
"He grabbed/held on to my ass when I was 16. It was super uncomfortable and I let my friend keep our m&amp;g photo because I didn’t want to be reminded of it.

He and his girlfriend came into a store I managed in 2012, too, and he was super pissy and rude to me and my staff."
"Here's one that I still run into as an adult, trying to make my friends understand: not being able to ""fall back"" on your family.

Even at age 30+ I have many friends who still have a cell phone on their parents' plan, or who decided to move back home to save up money to buy a house. In my 20's, my roommates would lose employment and not be too worried, knowing their families would help them pay bills if needed until they found a new job. 

I got kicked off all my parents' plans as soon as I turned 18. One month when I was 22, I was short $20 for my phone bill, and I asked my parents for money for the first time in years... and they couldn't afford to front me that because they had their own bills to pay."
"When I was working at New Orleans at the strip club that guy from John and Kate +8 came in and for whatever reason it felt entitled toGet free drinks. When I gave him the time he asked me if I knew who he was? I said yeah the whole world does, a deadbeat dad. You owe me $20.

He asked for a manager. Five minutes later he was escorted out of establishment.
"
"""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""

No, saying you're sorry is how you argue and arguing is fine! It's healthy! And you should apologize if you're an asshole and sometimes even if you're not (says the woman who just apologized to her husband earlier for getting extremely sarcastic, but in my defense who asks someone where they're going when they are heading towards the bathroom?)"
"I met my husband at 33, got married at 36. I just turned 38 last week.  I had been single most of my life, he had a couple of long-term relationships before me. We met on OKcupid. 

I had been off/on the dating sites for a long time. A couple of horror stories, a couple of great dates/short term relationships/friendships, but nothing that ever worked out long-term. I always joke with my husband about how right before I met him, I had splurged and bought a TON of expensive cooking gadgets, figuring that I'd never get to register for anything. 

I think one of the ""pros"" of meeting older was that we both knew what we wanted, and were both very comfortable in our senses of ""self"", if that makes sense. 

I don't think our experience was terribly different from friends who got married younger. Maybe a little bit in the sense that neither of us had ""settled"" until we found the right person. I know a lot of people for whom getting married having kids was an active ""goal"" in life (e.g. not wanting to be an ""old"" bride, wanting to have 3-4 kids, etc.) so I feel that they sort of settled when the time came. I never really pictured myself getting married or having children until I met my husband. It was something that I would be happy with, but not a ""goal"" if that makes sense? 

The one thing that's kind of the elephant in the room right now is kids. We're running out time and have to get off the fence. 

I do wish that I met him earlier in life- but I couldn't be happier than I am right now with him. "
"We sit on the same side of the table at restaurants. Mostly because we just like being next to each other, but also because he has trouble hearing sometimes and I don't speak very loudly.

He's also the small spoon, like, a lot."
"I'll repeat Lily &amp; Marshall. They both have codepency issues, Marshall more than Lily. Lily is also very manipulative with Marshall and her friends, and a control freak.

Mr Big &amp; Carrie are far worse though. She's selfish, unrealiable and needy. He's an arrogant fuck boy. They're both cheaters. That's not a sweet or romantic relationship AT ALL."

"Guys who don't say hurtful things out of anger. It'd be nice to find a guy who will express that they're angry and then take some time away before trying to hash it out. 

Guys who are kind to everyone. I was recently disappointed with a male friend who was so kind to me but such an asshole to girls he was hooking up with. I found it very hard to believe that he could be completely different"
I actually prefer conditioner. Herbal essence is pretty cheap and leaves ya legs baby soft lol
"He's funny, smart, kind, and considerate. He gets me and really sees *me* and who I am rather than what he wants to see in me. We have similar ways of looking at the world. We have similar values and wants. He's really really funny. I've never once felt like I had to hide or edit parts of myself to be with him. I can be unapologetically genuine and so can he. Also, he fucks like a champ. "
"Had been dating a guy for a month. We were in driving to the movies. He tells me that I look so cute with short hair, but he would like to see me grow it out. I asked why he asked me out if he preferred long air. He tried to laugh it off, and said he figured I would start to wear my hair the way my *man* preferred. I told him to take it or leave it, and he was free to find a woman with long hair.

It took every bit of restraint in me not to roast him over his hairline beating a retreat from his forehead. I turned the car around and dropped his ass off at his house. He was dumfounded, and still standing at the curb as I drove away. "
"&gt;I'm ashamed to say that I stole food from my job a few times.

"I was miserable and lonely for a long time. That meant I clung like a pathetic barnacle to every loser who came my way. That meant they knew they could treat me poorly and I wouldnt do anything because loneliness was worse than a crummy boyfriend. Finally in 2014 (when I was 34)I decided to stop dating losers and live for myself. I tried new adventures, traveled, met new friends, and did things for myself. How amazing!

That summer I met a nice guy. He wasn't the typical guy I was used to dating. I almost let him go but he was patient and kind. We fell in love and got engaged 10 months later. Married 6 months after that. I had always wanted to be married before I turned 36 and I did it with a week to spare. Four months later I was pregnant.  My doctor said if I wanted more than one I should do it soon, so we got pregnant again on vacation in October. My kids will be 18 months apart. 

We knew it was right so we didn't feel the need to date many years or have a long engagement. Our lives were pretty well established--we both had stable jobs, housing, finances, etc.

The wedding was great. All out friends are in their 30s and 40s so everyone partied but still behaved. There were no crazy drunk people or immature bridesmaids.

I wish I hadn't spent my 20s being miserable and alone. I wish I had loved myself without needing a man to define my self worth. I believe it was a lot of time wasted. 

I wish that I didn't feel the rush now to make up time. I got pregnant so quickly after we got married, we never got to enjoy being newlyweds. (I had been told that, due to my age, it could take 2 years to get pregnant, so we started ""trying"" a couple months after we got married. Didn't think I'd get pregnant so quickly.)

I think looking back, I didn't need a man to make my life happy, I needed a happy life to attract a great man to share it with. "

No.... I'm a solutions engineer. -_-"
"One was about my goals to have children and how would I balance my career around such. This was at a well known semiconductor company. I responded with ""Well, how do you guys do it?"" They sort of laughed but then waited for a serious response. I looked back at them. They then said that the company is very busy, and wants to make sure I'm not out for maternity leave. I was appalled. I then get told by the HR woman that the company does not have maternity leave , and that's what vacation time and sick days are for, so plan on getting pregnant accordingly....which she then asked,"" you are fresh out of college, that won't be for a while, right?"" I just stared at her.

Fucking unreal."
"Tom Cruise. He came through the Holocaust Museum in DC right before some promotional stint for a movie in 2009. On his phone the entire time, including in the Hall of Remembrance, talking about his weekend plans and holding up people who were actually interested in being there. Irreverent turd. "
"No rude celebrities, but I've met Daniel Radcliffe twice and he is the best. He took a selfie with me the second time and actually had a good 2 minute conversation with me! 

My brother is also really obsessed with Lord of the Rings and his cousin (his mom's side) was a cinematographer at the time on a small budget film and got John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) to call my brother on the phone. He was thrilled. "
"Well, she also had a problem with not knowing what sex really was, as we also found out that night.  Her parents gave her a book before she got married that basically emphasized that sex was about a holy union between couples and how God was present in the act, etc, but literally gave NO practical information (like what a clitoris is or positions or that you have a hymen).  That was all she knew about sex.

I tried to give her a crash course (she was getting married a week after me), but she just got overwhelmed again."
"I have a friend who won’t take birth control OR USE CONDOMS because she sees it as playing god. She’s been married since she was 19 so at least she doesn’t have to worry about STDs or anything. But she recently became pregnant and was distraught at first. “I’m only 25 I’m not ready for kids. We’ve been pulling out for six years and this has never happened!” I’m honestly surprised it didn’t happen sooner.

"About 7. When a male highschool teacher at the school i went to told me he wanted to ""reserve"" me for himself when i got older. I was scared for months. "
"I had a point in my life where I couldn't afford the bus ticket to work and my bike got stolen.  I snuck on the bus, and was stopped by the driver.

When I told him I was going to work and payday was the  next day he let me ride there for free, and gave me a transfer pass for way later in the day to get home.

I will never forget that kindness.  On payday I bought ingredients for cookies and baked some for him."
"Definitely Ethan Hawke. Completely self-important. Unreasonable demands and terrible attitude.

Not the subject of the thread, but John Travolta was the nicest. Came off very kind and warm to everyone he spoke to."
"What I like to call the ""two night stand"".

A guy leads you on, pretends to be really into you, everything is going great. Sex happens, it's great, you make plans again and the date once again ends in sex.

Then things either fizzle out or you get ghosted on after those two sex acts."
"I met this girl once who thought her vagina and urethra were the same hole. She thought women only had two holes, one for poop and the other for urine and our periods. We were all dumbfounded, tried to explain how tampons would block our urine, that didn't convince her. We had to pull out my mom's old nursing books (This was pre internet) to show an actual diagram of a woman's genitals. "
"This was in 2015 so a whole year before he reportedly split from his wife. He was basically partying it up with Leo DiCaprio (who is nice but you know to gird your loins and keep your distance with him), and kept hitting on really young girls. If he found out they were, you know, barely legal, he was even more interested and would step up his game. Sometimes it worked and then afterwards he'd totally ignore them, which was the best case scenario for them, or he'd tell people what he did with them, show pictures around, mock the girls for whatever little imperfections he could find. 

He also really liked picking on people. Waiters and so on. He'd drop or spill something on purpose, then laugh and go ""hey, you missed something"" and if they didn't immediately rush over, he'd get weirdly aggressive. 

Other typical douche behaviours like throwing money around and expecting people to be at his beck and call, ""do you know who I am"" more than a few times, ""do you know who my father in law is"" just as often. I only spoke to him directly once and he looks at you like you're prey. It's very eerie."
"George Clooney. When I was barely legal he catcalled me from his limo and was quite persistent, getting more profane as time passed, to the point he followed me for almost two blocks. I am now almost 25 to give you an idea of when this was."

One time I was petting my dog and he had really bad gas and my mom asked if he queefed on me because she thought it just meant a silent fart and I was laughing so hard I had to leave the room while my dad explained it to her

"I remember the days when breaking up with someone over text was considered extremely rude. Now, it’s actually a luxury."
male coworker has many gems.... first one that comes to mind is when he told a female student not to feel bad that she isn’t great at math because girls’ brains aren’t wired to understand math like men’s brains are 
"In the maternity ward after giving birth to my son, I was talking to another mum two beds over. She was holding her baby and commented to me that the ""white stuff"" (vernix) covering the child was probably from her having so much sex with her husband before giving birth. "
Almost an adult... a 17 year old girl not allowed to use tampons because her parents said it would make her impure.
"One thing I haven't seen mentioned here yet is the shame that comes from being poor. As a kid, other kids notice when your clothes are old, dirty, don't fit, or aren't warm enough. I remember one winter a classmate observed that my hand me down jacket didn't look very warm. She was right. 

When our culture tells us that poor people must be poor because of their own personal failure (lazy, entitled, not working hard enough), it's really hard to not internalize that and feel dreadfully ashamed of your family's circumstances. "
"I'm not sure if this is sheltered or just weird, but a guy at my uni once told me that it was actually good for us to stare directly into the sun, and that we should do it for 40 minutes every day. The reason everyone thought it was bad, was because the government wanted to spread lies to make us buy vitamins."

"I know people hate the show but all the relationships in Big Bang theory.

Penny is written almost like this trophy that Leonard wants to win and doing so drives his character arc.

"""Never go to bed angry""

I beg your pardon but sometimes during a fight the absolute best thing you can do is stop talking, go to sleep and get up the next day with a calmer attitude. My husband and I often drop really stupid fights entirely and both apologize the next morning because sleeping on it makes us realize we were just being dumb and worked up."
"I know exactly what you mean. Education put me in classrooms with really well-off people most of my life and I’ll never forget the way they tried to badger me into paying for a study abroad trip. They couldn’t understand why I wouldn’t go.

Me: I really can’t afford that at all.

Them (including teachers): Its the experience of a lifetime! Money comes and goes, but this is something you’ll cherish the rest of your life!

My life experiences have never taught me that money “comes and goes.” It’s taught me that you save your money, invest what you can for my future children so they’re not like me, and try to stay ahead of looming financial problems."
Move. Exercise avoids a lot of pain and discomfort in later life.
"That you don’t just birth a baby...you don’t stop contractions just because you birthed a baby and a placenta, you bleed forever, nursing does hurt at first, your water breaking, if it does because it doesn’t always, isn’t necessarily a gush sometimes it’s just like you’re peeing and can’t stop, and after you’ve pushed an 8-10 lb baby out of your vagina and all your core muscles are sore and your gut is all floppy someone is going to come in and MASH the shit out of your uterine area to make sure you don’t end up with a life threatening blood clot...but most of all that looking into the face of that sweet tiny human that you just created is going to be the most terrifying thing ever. "
"Being too embarrassed to ever have your friends see where you live, and either always going over to their houses or obfuscating where you live. For me it was in a trailer park with a notorious meth-y nickname, and I would tell people I lived in a totally different neighborhood (I cringed when I saw Lady Bird because it was just too fucking real) and never allow anyone's parents to drive me home or see where I actually lived."
I think you are the first person I know who understands why I rent and don't buy.
A few of us spent 20 minutes trying to explain to a 50yo male coworker what the mothers room was going to be used for. At first he thought that meant the coworker was going to bring her kid to work with her. Then he was confused as to why she wouldn't just leave every time it was the baby's meal time.  When he finally accepted it was for pumping he didn't understand why she wouldn't just pump at home. I genuinely don't think he ever got it. Craziest party is he has a kid. 
Toby Maguire is one of the strangest people I've ever met.  Truly bizarre and very unsettling.  
"Used to have a coworker who was 30, and wasn't 100% sure that dry humping couldn't cause pregnancy. "
"I hate the forced smile he cracks whenever he's getting his picture taken. There have been several occasions where he's shown me a picture of himself and said, ""I like this one of me"" and in the picture he looks like his loved ones are tied up off-camera and someone is telling him that if he doesn't pretend he's having a good time, they'll be killed. I never said anything because I know he's not doing it on purpose, but I don't know why he can't act natural because his unforced smile is so beautiful!"

"Nicolas Sparks (author of the Notebook).

He used to park his stupid Jaguar with the personalized license plate that said ""novelist"" in the church parking lot EVERY WEEK even when they kindly asked him not to do that numerous times. (He was not a member of this church). There was parking on the street but he didn't want to pay for the meter I guess. 

Another time, at a charity auction for a local school, where crafts made by the students were being auctioned off, my mom's friend put a bid on this student-made quilt and Nicolas Sparks' wife turned around in her seat and said ""Bitch, are you trying to out-bid me?"" This was a CHARITY AUCTION for a CHILDREN'S SCHOOL that was being held IN A CHURCH. Who says that?!?

I've met him other times and he was ok but the family has a bit of a reputation."
A friend from college didn't understand how periods work. He thought women's vaginas just...popped out and became external once a month and that was what the bleeding was.

"I hate when people complain, ""I saw someone using food stamps and they had name brand clothes and a smartphone.""

I have a low-income bus pass and still have name brand clothes and a smartphone. The phone was a Christmas present from a friend that cost $25 on sale. If I didn't have it, I couldn't use cashback apps, book an Uber (since I don't have a car), check the bus schedules when I'm out, or deposit my paycheck since my bank is in a different suburb.

Name brand clothes are either hand me downs from roommates, bought on clearance, or bought at the thrift store in the nice part of town."
Bet he wished he could've killed that bill.
"That's some internalized misogyny, right there. She should feel proud of her accomplishments. "
"Yes! I use conditioner on my legs every time I shave them. Works great and leaves them silky soft. Saves a lot of money, too. Feel free to buy the cheapest conditioner you can find and you’ll only need about a dime size amount for each leg.

I use shampoo on my underarms, though, because it does a great job of removing deodorant residue so it won’t clog your razor."
"That the doctors know what they're doing.  They are not just trying to push drugs onto you, they are not trying to speed up your birth so they can go home and take a bath, they are not trying to limit your choices.

Seriously, every article, pinterest post, and doula seems to want to convince you otherwise which left me questioning everything the doctor and nurses were doing and made it very difficult for me to just relax and trust that they would get me through it the best and safest way possible. "
I can't even logically come to a conclusion as to why those two things would be related. 
"""You complete me.""


No I don't, get your shit together before you be in a relationship."
That it would hurt to sit for a week. And that merely walking around the block would be exhausting. 
"I've really soured on Quentin between hearing multiple stories like this, and then finding out how he treated Uma.. "
"I'm the opposite- I grew up in a solidly middle class home, and my adult life has been spent as lower income/extremely poor.  Not by choice- I had a very good career and a lot of money in my 20s, and then I had autistic triplets, and I've been skirting the poverty line ever since. 

My family is generally supportive, but they really have no clue.  We grew up cooking for ""drop in centers"" and volunteering at food banks, but actually going to those places because you have no food in the house is foreign to my family.  My parents sponsored 7 refugee families that I can think of- they're really the ones who understand my adult life.  

My furniture is shit.  My son is autistic with a lot of challenges, and one of his things is bouncing on furniture.  No furniture is meant to withstand 220 pounds of solid muscle jumping on it, so all of our chairs/couches have broken spines.  It costs money to have old furniture taken away, so we live with it. 

Canada is great for primary health care- I can't imagine having to think before taking my child to the doctor.  One of my kids had cancer and she was in a world-class pediatric cancer hospital within 6 hours of her diagnosis.  But I had to beg and plead and skp rent payments to get her the prescriptions that she needed- hospital staff were awesome at ""redirecting"" unused meds to people who needed them, but I still had to make up the shortfall. 

We don't have a car.  That's mostly doable as we've got a decent public transportation system, but it's not perfect.  I've got family all over Ontario, and I really only see them when they come to see me, or when I get a ride somewhere. 

Fortunately I know how to sew, and garden.  And we have two massive freezers that I found on freecycle, so I can bulk buy meat.  My family has a yearly tradition of making pork sausage- we knock out 500 pounds or something in a day.  It works out to .70/pound or something like that- my Dad pays for my sausage, but I don't think that any of my family realize that it's a staple in our house. 

My family is pretty great, but they don't want to hear the nitty gritty.  And I don't mention it to them, because we live in different worlds. 

Things that I miss buying because they're not on the radar.  Non-crap clothing.  I can buy leggings for 4 dollars, and I'll have to take them apart and restitch them before I don't have a ""so let's flash my vagina to everyone"" moment.  I miss going into a store change room and having a choice about what to buy. I've had two knee replacements in the last 4 months and I'd love an awesome cane that would support me and not look like the ""get off my lawn/I'm going to beat your head in""type of cane. 

I literally can't remember the last time I went out and bought a bra that fit me.  Not really a big deal as I'm an A cup, but I really used to love lingerie. I'm planning my garden now- I haven't been able to garden for years because of the arthritis, but hopefully this year I'll be back at it.  I'm still pretending that i can get someone in with a rototiller to get out some of the weeds, but I'll realistically likely be planting in the corners. 

While I actually wouldn't trade my kids or their challenges for anything, I go through life embarassed.  I've let some long-term friendships slide because it's so incredibly humiliating to say that instead of dealing with work issues I'm hoping that I'll be able to buy bananas this week. 

The depressing part is that I miss the things that I grew up with.  My siblings (although they've all had their own problems) don't have to worry about rent, or food.  My Dad has really been stepping up lately, but it's horrible and embarassing to articulate just how poor we are.  And how much I love my kids- they're going through the same things that I am, but with a different understanding of what may be difficult in their lives. I try to take my kids as an example of WTFNess, but they've got more challenges than I ever will. "
"The original Addams Family TV show was incredibly popular among children, and when surveyed why the overwhelming answer wasn't the morbid/dark content, but because the parents loved each other so much  :)"
"When we're cuddling, he breathes on me. I have no idea why, but being breathed on makes me feel completely disproportionately angry. 

But I told him last week that it bothered me and now he puts his head at all kinds of funny angles to prevent it. Which is so sweet and adorable, but I worry about his neck getting cramped. "
"11 or 12.
I remember being about 13 and on my way to meet friends and I got wolf whistled by a grey haired guy as he walked past me. When I told my mum that night she told me I should only wear either a form fitting shirt or skinny jeans and not both if I don't want it happening again. Not blaming me but trying to protect me. 

I remember being 15 years old walking to my friend's birthday party and ringing my best friend (a guy) nearly in tears asking if he'd walk down to meet me and hold my hand the wau up because men kept touching my shoulders or waist trying to talk to me (I was in a dress walking through a rather conservative area on my own and I was stopped at least 8 times)

Those two incidences stand out to me the most, though they may not have been the earliest ones "
"I watched Jurassic World with my SO and at the end, when the throwback T-Rex saves the day and just walks away, I absolutely lost it. I sobbed for an hour about how the poor dinosaur didn’t have any dinosaur friends and was just left alone on this island without anyone to hang out with. It was ridiculous."
When I was in middle school a boy grabbed my boob as he was walking by my desk. My reflexes kicked in and I punched him as hard as I could in the stomach. He cried. I don't feel bad. He never touched me again.
"I grew up racing motocross. Around my first year of racing (about 11 years old) there was a boy who had been riding quite a bit longer than me but we were in the same racing class. I happened to walk by their pit area and heard the dad say to the son ""At least you're guaranteed to beat the girl"". Like it was so obvious since I was a girl there was no way I could beat any of them. Just more motivation for me to kick their ass. "
"""Men can't be raped, can they?""

"I was just talking to a new friend the other day and she was going shopping because she ""still had $400 left on her credit card."" I didn't think I heard her right and asked her what she meant, and she said she still has $400 before she hits her limit so she needs to spend before the month ends. When I thought about it more, it made sense that her ""monthly budget"" was just her credit card limit as her parents pay it off for her every month :( "
"I told someone that I couldn't have kids, they asked was it me or my husband, I said me.
They said, why don't you get your husband to get another woman pregnant and the sue for custody of the baby.

I have never been so lost for words.  Their theory was that it would be cheaper than adoption. "
"Men who seem to think they are not only entitled to a MFF 3-some, but as his girlfriend you are responsible for finding some poor girl to bring home.  Dude, just no."

"I used to volunteer at a comic convention.

Linda Blair was 3 hours late for her signing session (literally continued to try to re-negotiate her fee with the staffer trying to get her to come down) and was extremely rude to fans in line. One guy was trying to get something signed for a friend and it was this super sweet story and you could tell he was so excited to be able to do this for his friend, and she just said, ""Oh."" Like, completely stone-cold. The guy looked crushed.


Summer Glau was bad too. She showed up with her husband, her baby &amp; her parents... but we weren't expecting her parents, we didn't know they were going to show up. She was a nightmare to the driver who then had to drive back up to the airport in a larger car and then she was a nightmare when the hotel didn't automatically have a room next to hers for her parents to use. She also kept walking away from her signing table for 20 minutes plus at a time without informing any convention staff, and her line was always so packed we had to keep capping it even when she wasn't there &amp; she'd act like it was the world's biggest inconvenience when a convention staffer would try to wrangle her back to the table to do what she was literally being paid to do.


Jeremy Renner was one of the worst, though. He kept openly hitting on half the women volunteers, grabbing at us, and staring at the breasts of every woman coming through his line. One fan in a gorgeous cosplay dress said something about how she'd always been a Hawkeye fan and he broke eye-contact with her boobs long enough to look up and tell her that was the stupidest thing he'd ever heard.

Luckily the list of ""good celebs"" I've dealt with in the same position is much longer: Clark Gregg was among the absolute nicest, Brett Dalton, Elizabeth Henstridge, J. August Richards, Barry Bostwick, Chloe Bennet, Henry Winkler, Kate Beckinsale, Bill Paxton (RIP,) Carl Weathers, Norman Reedus, Lennie James, Rosario Dawson, and several more tbh."

 Guy at work said it's ok for men to cheat bc it's something they're expected to do but it isn't something women should do bc it is morally wrong for us. He's a straight adult man and has admitted to cheating in the past... I mentioned he was being incredibly offensive to men and misogynistic regarding his views on who should or should not cheat. He was reported to HR and was given a warning. He straightened up his act after that. 
"She didn’t know that you could get prescription sunglasses (she wears glasses for the record). She also didn’t know what vegetarians eat (despite being friends with several), and announced to everyone that she was doing a vegetarian month and talked about it constantly. About two-third of the way through that month she mentioned eating shrimp, and I then had to break it to her that fish and seafood are not vegetarian, to which she then sputtered indignantly “Well where do you get your protein then?!”."
"My depression gets really severe right before my period, like ""thinking about suicide a lot more"" kind of severe, but one time I dropped a package of blueberries and they rolled all over the kitchen and I cried while picking them up. Then the next day I got my period and I was like ""lmao oh."""

"When I was 11, my classmate and one of his friends pointed my nipples out through the layers of my training bra and my school uniform. As normal preteen girls do, I twisted his nipple while informed them he has those too, there weren’t any needs to bother me. He tattled to his mommy. It was rather satisfying."

"The most hurtful one (different than offensive) is ""You'll never know real love unless you're a mother."" I love my family immensely and it hurts to have people say that the love I am capable of is merely superficial and without depth.

The most offensive one might have been an off-hand comment someone made to me about how men would never ultimately want a woman who can't get pregnant; they'd just cheat on her with a *real* woman. Yikes."
Ryan Reynolds being nice makes my soul happy. He seems like such a nice dude.
"I came here to write this. I hate it too. 

Here's the quote in it's entirety: ""I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.""

It just sounds like a warning to a potential partner. "
"The right answer was obviously, ""I'd say yes, take the million, and use $5000 of it to pay a male escort who looks like me to pretend to be me (with makeup and my clothes to be extra me-ish) and then to go meet the woman and complete the deal in my place while I take you to Tahiti for a month."""
"They gently push your boundaries. Testing to see how strong they are and if you will enforce them. If you budge an inch, they keep nudging for a mile.

"You can read [this NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html) where she describes it in her own words.

But it counts double if it's about a stereotypically male subject, and triple if it's an area he's insecure about or something related to his area of expertise. 

Extra negative points if it's about YOUR area of expertise that he knows less about overall.

This trait is a rare form of respectfulness. "
"I looooove when men do this so much. One time I was talking with a friend group (all guys) I wasn’t super familiar with, but they were my friends friends. I was telling a story and someone just interrupted to tell their own story. For some reason, I was courageous, and I said “Hey, I was talking”.  My friend said “Fuck yeah Kat, good job” and I got to tell my story. I feel like if he hadn’t said that, everyone would’ve been like “aw c’mon, don’t be like *thaaaat*” and laughed at me. But he shut them down.    "
"I hate how text-reliant it has become. I'm a huge introvert, and even online conversations wear me out a lot. I'd rather be asked out often than having endless text conversations every single waking moment. When I'm with the person, I'm with the person. If I'm doing my own thing, I'm doing my own thing. 

Very frequent texting in the early stages of dating can be just... Lazy. I don't know. I don't want to sound judgemental and I get why it happens, but, like, the effort put into a meaningful conversation via text cannot be compared to the effort of actually meeting up to have those conversations in person. "
I got serial killer vibes from him. Everyone laughs when I say that but I mean it.
"When I had my first baby 10 years ago I researched what I thought was every aspect of birth. I was prepared and going to have a natural birth. I felt empowered and ready. 

For the most part, things went properly. I needed a little pitocin because my water broke and labor was not progressing, but other than that I had a med free, low intervention birth. 

What I failed to understand from all my research was that I could only push during a contraction.  Here I am, 26 hours into labor, ready to be done and meet my baby. I tried pushing in between contractions and everyone lost their mind telling me I had to wait. But, his head, it was half way out! I had a baby’s head hanging out of my vagina and these assholes were telling me to lay there and relax for a minute. I lost my shit at that moment and started screaming at everyone to “fucking get him out of me!” It wasn’t even the pain, I was just freaked about his head being RIGHT THERE. "
"Not so much the birth, but the first after birth poop is just the worst. Like birthing another baby, except this time no-one holding your hand or wiping your brow, and no epidural for you.

And the fluid! I don't know if it was the drugs or just the birth itself, but u inflated like a water balloon, and all the fluid just sort of 'settled' flat on the bed. Was really really weird. When I laid down my throat closed up because of itand was suffocating, but the nurses didn't believe me because I was being a whiny brat about the c-section pain. "

"Ran into this guy I had once gone on a double date with in a bar. We were also in the same major and had been in a bunch of classes together. He was kinda dumb, no way around it. We were chatting a bit, and in front of his new GF he expressed immense shock that I was actually in the major (despite being partnered up in a bunch of classes together???) because I was “too pretty” to be in our major. His GF wasn’t happy about it either lol. "

"i wish they wouldn't assume ''conventionally attractive'' as the default. every conversation where they talk about advantages women in general have, it doesn't really apply to average-to-ugly women.

guys are raised being told you can make up for your looks with a good personality and surrounded by media encouraging the ''beauty and the beast'' narrative. girls who aren't ''pretty'' otoh fundamentally fail at being women when they grow up. and they aren't often viewed as such at all, which circles right back to ''picturing every WOMAN as attractive''."

"Billy Corgan.  (Shocker, yes I know.)  Met him twice.  First time in '00, he was very nice.  The second time was 07, after their first Pumpkins reunion show in SF. He was just a miserable grump.  Bad vibes all around.  On the other hand, my favorite was B.P. Helium from Of Montreal (sweetest dude ever and the only one in the band who took the time to meet us.). I ran into Jimmy Fallon at a bar in Detroit, drunkenly walked up to him, got about 6 inches from his face, and just nodded in confirmation that it was him.  He took it in stride and didn't call security, so he's a good guy in my book.  He genuinely seemed like a nice guy.  I'm just a creep when I'm drunk. "
"My friend was in her 20's at the time and was planning on moving out from her parents'. Her and her sister had looked at an apartment and wanted to rent it together, and were just working out the logistics. I happened to be hanging out with them and discussing budget, cost of living, etc., and my friend asked, ""Wait, does cable cost money?""

I gave her a look and said, ""Uhh...yeah. And it's pretty expensive. There's a reason why I haven't had cable in years."""

"Copying my comment from another thread about egg donation. I've donated twice and part of the requirement was that you'd already delivered a baby at term. I'm in the UK though so it may be different if you're elsewhere. 

I had blood tests done looking for genes for genetic disorders, STDs  and recreational drugs, when the bloods all  came back clear I had to complete a questionnaire about my health (including mental health) and lifestyle. After this I spoke to a counsellor and I was shown how to administer the drugs myself. I didn't find the drugs really affected me and I had little to no side effects but from what I've heard from others this is rare. 

The process is invasive and involves multiple vaginal ultrasounds, injections into your stomach or thigh followed by collection which for me was semi sedated and somewhat painful and uncomfortable. I had 12 eggs collected on my first donation and 16 on my second donation. My eldest son was 3 when I donated for the first time then I went on to have my younger son last year, which was a few years after my second donation with no issues. My donations led to a singleton boy for the first family and twin boys for the second family. 

After the procedure I was groggy from the anesthesia and I needed someone to bring me home and keep an eye on me for the day as I wasn't really with it. The next day I was absolutely fine, I was told to take it easy and rest but I was pretty much back to normal straight away.

Edit I was also given the opportunity to write a little something about myself for the resulting children which I did, and I also signed a disclaimer stating that I understood in future they would have the opportunity to have access to my details and could possibly contact me.

"This happened to my best friend recently. They dated a few times, he says she's amazing and wants to keep getting to know her, always had sex at the end of the date.

Then the guy suddenly stops speaking to her, she asks why, ""oh things were getting too serious and I'm not ready for that."" She was like ""translate this for me, I don't understand him"" ""dude only wanted sex, sorry bff.""

Worst part is that he even went away to Australia for like two months and they spoke every day while he was away, then suddenly he comes back, uses her for quick sex and discards her. The day before he stopped speaking to her they went on a date where he told her how beautiful and amazing she was and how happy he was to have met her (and then they obviously had sex).

Edit: I gotta add, he stopped texting her after she told him her period was late and she was rethinking the idea of having sex outside a relationship. She said that still, she was willing to do it with him, because they were headed that way **and he agreed, saying he definitely saw them together**.

Radio silence for a week, she has started the last several conversations so she's waiting for him to text. Decides to text him ""hey the pregnancy test was negative"" ""cool"" ""so how are you doing?"" he read it and never replied.

After a week of nothing, she texts him and he says he's just been too busy. I was with her and told her it was bullshit. She asked about the status of their relationship, and he says he's not ready for anything serious. ""But you said we were headed that way"". Read.

A week or so passes by, and he texts ""hey if you thought about it we can still keep having sex"". I told her to block him on the spot."
"I havnt but my mum is now 54 and she has had a breast enlargement when she was 26, she went from triple A to an E.

She is still gorgeous but I know looking back she would of gone to a more natural size. "
"Agreed.  I mean, I love her parents, but they really sheltered their daughters.  For example: If they wanted to go to a sleepover and a movie was going to be played, my friend had to call her parents to get their permission to watch it if it was PG-13 or above.  (Including LOTR, which she loved but we had to warn her if a ringwraith scene was about to pop up because if she saw one, she’d have nightmares for days).

Her younger sister turned out completely different even though they both had the same rules and I think it’s because the sister purposefully chose to expose herself to more “worldly” (as they put it) things and read more secular books rather than just religious or kid’s books like my friend did."

"Nothing is ever their fault, whatever the problem is, it's on you. They word it so that they don't accept any responsibility and try to make you feel bad for the things they did that made you feel bad. Let's say they stood you up on a date, their explanation is something like ""You didn't remind me, you know my memory sucks."" (when they could take a note or something) ""You didn't call me in the morning, I thought there was no date."" (when they could call you and ask for confirmation) 

And breadcrumbing/fuck boy behavior: relationship version.

The last thing I sent to him was a funny comment that someone said to me. Guess he didn’t find it funny. "
"I don't consider any of that rude. From the celebrity's perspective, if you give out one autograph/photo, it's potentially the start to a group of people stopping, asking for similar things, and they could be there all day fulfilling them.

A big one that hasn’t been said yet is that the bar is lower for friends than it is for significant others. Subconsciously our expectations aren’t as high for friends. We often don’t spend as much time with friends as we do with an SO so you may not realize certain qualities in a friend until you start dating.  Someone who is a great friend to you may not have any of the qualities you need in a SO. Lots of stuff like that.

"Ugh, yes.  I barely date but the last four guys who have shown interest jumped straight from ""wanna date"" to asking about sex during - or even before - the first actual date.  

What I've learned is that *nothing* screams ""I'm not interested in you as a person"" more than nose-diving straight for the topic of fucking.  While sexual compatibility is important in a relationship and I do like that we've grown more comfortable with the topic as a culture, I'm not interested in having that discussion over dinner on our first date.  I politely and clearly set boundaries when the topic comes up and each one has taken my willingness to talk frankly about it to mean that I want to have lots of it and share all the juicy details.

I finally gave up.  The last guy took making out as an invitation to jam his hand down my pants and refused to take it out until I got both hands around his and got him to unhook his fingers from my pantes.  He just kept repeating ""C'mon..I just want to feel you.""  And now suddenly I'm the prude?"
This definitely something I notice about my self. My husband and I are now solidly middle class and grocery money is never an issue. But I struggle so hard to like fresh things. It’s become a bit of an obsession for me to make sure my son always has fresh produce to eat. 
"For me anyways, I grew up in the hood where I live. I think something I noticed in terms of differences is that a lot of other poor people don’t judge criminality the same way in their communities. Poor communities are often worlds within themselves, and have different norms and ways of thinking about certain things. Like I can say as a kid, I knew drug dealing wasn’t good. BUT I seen many people feeding their kids, paying the bills, and taking care of their families by slinging drugs. Sometimes the drug dealers or other criminals would even buy us things like soccer balls and nets for the neighbourhood, put on big block bbqs for families, etc. Where as, people with a “good” job like cops or social workers weren’t trusted because they broke up families, harassed people, and generally abused their power and treated us like dirt a lot of the time. I still don’t like cops at all, and don’t trust them one bit even tho I’m not and never have been someone to have trouble with the law. Plus we often called them snakes because they’d be reporting people for hooking, selling weed, or having rowdy parties and stuff but then they’d be coming back after hours to buy drugs, sex, and party. They made careers off of poor people basically is how it felt. Not only that but when you grow up in a community (and especially if your community is is historically disenfranchised) that has no resources, no opportunity, no good schools, bad policing, etc.  Crime doesn’t seem like this horrible bad thing always, sometimes it’s just the only other legit option someone might have or feel they have. 

Another thing for me anyways was that middle-class people often came across as really sensitive. Like condescendingly so sometimes. They’d act too shocked at the stories we talked about, disgusted by our living conditions (even if we didn’t have much control over them), and generally kinda treat poor people like a world vision commercial. I don’t really feel that way anymore, but that was really hard to overcome. "

I did get paid £600 per donation but the money wasn't the motivating factor for me.

"My dad was just an overwhelming douche about women, but there were a few highlights that stick out.

I was told that women couldn't pray directly to God. So I needed to tell my dad what I needed prayer for so he could communicate that. His evidence for this was ephesians 5:23 ""For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.""

My dad was a big supporter of the Pearls book ""created to be his helpmeet"" which me and my sister's prefer to call ""created to be a doormat"". The entire book is a giant misogynistic piece of crap. But what my dad got out of it was basically ""a woman's sole purpose in life is to make her husband happy, she has no say, cannot back talk, she must never decline sex. The real kicker in the book for me was a chapter on how if your husband sexually abused your children you should have him arrested...but cannot divorce him, must visit him in jail, and when he gets out of prison must be ready for him with open arms to perform your wifely duties"

She's also always in bed before 10pm (later than that, and it's a ""super late night"").  Is really wanting to get married soon (she's 26) but is not willing to go out and meet anyone despite gentle coaxing and lots of support from friends.

She's a great person, just delicate :)"
He’s too big to sit on my lap but he is frequently the small spoon or lies on my chest instead of me in his. We like it.
"Same thing happened to me EXCEPT I was interviewing for an HR position! They straight out asked me if I was done having children, I thought it was a joke, but they were dead serious. I left the interview with a follow up email stating I was withdrawing my application and had no desire to work for their company. "

"Maguire. DiCaprio likes them young as well but not that young. 

Ron Meyer was his father in law, he's since divorced. Big wig studio exec, I think he's vice chairman at NBC now."
My boyfriend and I kind of switch a lot of gender roles because it's the way we are. Like he wants a big wedding ceremony I just want to elope. He's in touch with his emotions and throws around I love you. I'm very internal with my emotions and rarely say I love you. It's mostly emotion based stuff. I think it's because he was raised mostly by his mom who is a very emotional woman and I was raised in a family where emotion is weakness and we prey on weakness.

Michael: Yeah.

Oscar: So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...

"Even if you were married, a lot of married couples these days have two cars. The only non-sexist reason I can think of why a husband would get a say is if it's a shared car, but there's no reason to assume that a., the woman is married to a man, b., he has equal interest in the car, and c., if A and B were both true, that they hadn't already talked about it and agreed they wanted it done."
"I think it's because he was lazy actually, and didn't bother for very long. He was not very clever, he's the only person I've ever met who became interested in joining scientology from watching 'Going clear'."

"That, for many of us, pregnancy and birth aren't things we look forward to or enjoy, but necessary evils that are the singular unpleasant means to an end. I feel like so many men I know hear about all the unwanted body changes, the vomiting, the pain and tiredness, LABOR, birth injuries, and all the frustration associated with breastfeeding and immediately go ""Ugh, glad I don't have to do it!"" 

Well, guess what? I don't want to do it either! If I'd had the choice to be born a man, I would have taken it, but instead I got stuck with the short straw and have to be the one to make all the physical sacrifices for the shared joy. It actually sometimes makes me a little resentful. I tried explaining to my partner one time by saying that it's as if the two of us were going on vacation, but I had to push the car the whole way there while he road in it the whole time, but he didn't really get it. "
Okay this one wins.

"I had a coworker once who developed GURD, (the valve at the top of your stomach doesn’t close all the way, causing wicked acid reflux). This woman was mid 30’s and had a masters degree with a 4.0. She was trying to get pregnant. She came in one day, announced she had GURD, and seemed confused about what it was. My mom has it so I explained. In a panic, she asked me if she could still get pregnant. Without missing a beat I said “If that’s how you’re trying to get pregnant you’re doing it wrong honey.”

She had a very poor grasp of biology."
"When I interviewed for my current job, my prospective boss seemed so nice I was super excited when I was offered the job. Come to find out she is an evil slithering snake who before I was hired on, went through about 10 admins in 3 years time. I hung on through the verbal and mental abuse and 9 years later I have outlasted everyone she oversees. About 5 years in, i changed positions within the company and began working under a new supervisor. She now works remotely and we never see her.

A few things that make her evil:

Verbally assaulted me numerous times regarding personal events out of my control such as car accident, home on fire etc...

Written up numerous times due to excessive days off (including vacations, holidays and approved time off in general)

Years of gas lighting and being written up for disobeying orders never given. 

During my time here, another position under her turned over 12 employees. 

She admitted to a few people here that she couldn't wait for her mother to die, she ended up passing some months later. 

The list could go on."

"I think it depends on your working definition of ""worst"". If ""worst"" means ""when I'm selfish and inconsiderate, and not even trying to be tolerable to be around"", then it's a terrible excuse for bad behaviour.

But if it means ""when I'm not coping well, and falling apart, and unable to focus on what's best for others"", then it's more ""if you only want to interact with me when I'm all about you, you don't deserve to""."
"Yep! There's some interesting research that part of the (complex) reasoning is that the way junk food is viewed is different by socioeconomic status-basically that wealthier parents see saying no to junk food as doing good for their kids, whereas many lower income families view it as a treat they can afford when they have to say no to so many other things.

"Aw, my grandma.  My grandpa, her spouse, lover and partner of 60 years is dying this week.  Everyone is gathered at their house except me because I have a young son to care for many states away.

My grandma and grandpa were both fantastic cooks.  My grandma did most of the cooking and my grandpa, the baking.  He must've made his carrot cake 1000 times or more because it was requested by so many people at so many functions.  But I remember my grandma's cheesecake too.  She grew an beautiful, wild, amazing vegetable garden for years and used to cook from that.  Her thanksgiving dinners were made completely from scratch.  I remember her lobster dinners with particular fondness too.  Yum.

Good memories."

"As a single guy in early twenties, it's super interesting for me to browse these answers. Really expands my knowledge about the female anatomy. Thanks ladies.

"When my LO was 3 weeks old we went to visit my side of the family who lived 3 hours away. My grandma walked in (didn't even say hi to me by the way) and just snapped, ""Where's the baby?"" I replied, ""FH has him. He's changing his diaper in the back bedroom."" She snapped, ""What? Why aren't YOU doing that?"" My dad (her son) told her, ""Because men are capable parents and don't just create the child and leave."" She didn't like that response. "
"My husband was at work talking with the guys one day and the topic of bras came up. One of the guys was discussing how uncomfortable he was with his developing daughter's breasts and how he wanted her to buy a bra to save him and his sons from that discomfort. 

Hubby then took a stand and spoke up - bras are not a chunk of armour made to protect fragile men from feeling uncomfortable. They are a support system that a woman has the right to choose whether she wears or not. 

I am still so proud of him for it. He brought up a few key points that day and as he relayed the story to me later that night, I gave him a couple more nuggets of knowledge in the bra department, should he find himself having such a discussion again. "
"Not having clothes. I had one pant, a couple shirts and shoes. I didn't even have underwear that fit right (given to me from my mom's coworker. They were new but too large and granny panties). I had to borrow my mom's coat and wore her flannels to stay warm in winter. This was in middle school. So embarrassing... "
"This is one of those phrases/terms that seems to mean a different thing to everyone. So I'm going to cover the two most common definitions:

**Person who has difficulty identifying their own emotions and sharing them**

This is what I was/am still a bit like so I'll answer as to the signs that pointed me in the right direction as to what was wrong:

- They never/rarely use the words ""I feel"" and when you ask how they feel they either say ""fine"" every time, say they don't know, tell you how they feel physically (""tired"" etc.), or tell you what they *think* (e.g. ""I feel like other people don't see me as an equal""). Ok, but how does it make them *feel*? They won't be able to answer this question, or if they can they will just say ""bad"". They can't tell the difference between different emotions and don't have words for those emotions so it's just a very vague sensation that they can't describe.

- They don't validate your emotions, they try to solve them instead. People who haven't had their own emotions validated don't understand the purpose of emotional validation, so they try to help you with your emotions by fixing them because that's what they do for themselves. They do this out of love and care for you and don't understand why you're upset or feel resentful that you're treating them like they're being mean when actually they just want you to be happy. (Hint: The way to change this is to offer repeat emotional validation for them - this can be difficult since they can't tell you how they feel, so you might have to guess ""that must make you feel really alone"", for example. In my case, it was a therapist that did this for me and when I understand the purpose of validation having experienced it myself then I started wanting to provide it to others).

- They want you to justify your emotions because they use that rule on themselves - they do not consider their own emotions to be valid or important if they can't be justified 'logically' so they dismiss their own welfare and will dismiss yours too unless you can 'make it valid' through justification. If you can't justify,then they will just say ""well don't feel like that"". Because that's what they do. They just 'shut it down' (they don't, really, they 'bottle it up', but they think they're shutting it down). Again, if you want an answer, then this comes from a lack of validation of their own emotions and they need to learn that *their* emotions are valid.

- Instead of discussing problems in relationships, they grow increasingly resentful, don't say anything, then just leave. They have an aversion to discussion because they think it is a type of coercion to ask for change and they feel that the relationship would be somehow 'impure' if anyone had to change anything about themselves. They have a fantasy of a 'perfect' match where both parties just always do everything right and there is never any conflict or resentment. They reach for that (completely unattainable) goal.

- They don't (or rarely) express emotion in their face or voice. They seem ""chill"" about everything. They seem totally unaffected. Every few years they suddenly break down and experience a storm of emotions they can't understand. They will say things like ""why am I upset?"" or ""I don't understand what's happening to me"". This is because they don't have an emotional language.

- They rarely discuss their relationships with others, but when they do they talk about it using stone cold logic and show absolutely no emotion. They don't understand why other people have emotions about it. They claim to ""genuinely"" not be upset when others treat them badly.

- They seem lonely and they're usually socially awkward or anxious, but they do nothing to make new friends or seek new connections.

**Person who is selfish**

- Basically, include all of the above but add that they're actively cold towards other people.

- They have ""neckbeard"" traits - not only do they have difficulty understand emotions but they believe this makes them ""superior"". They talk down about other people a lot.

- They are actively dismissive of other people's emotions, using words like ""over sensitive"".

- They think they're ""always right"" and are threatened by others having confidence so will do what they can to play Devil's advocate or demean other people's point of view. They *have* to feel superior because that's the only thing that's keeping their fragile self esteem afloat. This comes out as speaking down about everyone else.

Not all emotionally unavailable people are actively selfish, basically. Most of the people I personally know who have this problem are genuinely kind and want the best for others - they simply lack the skills (but I am proof they can be learned!)

Where people also believe themselves to be superior, they're just selfish and best avoided.

EDIT: Just realised the most obvious thing - both 'types' are terribly uncomfortable with intimacy, especially the emotional variety. They're both protecting themselves from having to 'feel', which makes them feel out of control and at risk of coercion or oppression by others. The first type will not seem particularly cold - often they're the opposite: **very** helpful - but they don't tell you they missed you when you were away (sorry, but they didn't, or not consciously - it's not because of you, it's because they have blocked that feeling off in themselves), if they invite you somewhere and you can't go they will just say it's ok without showing any disappointment (then potentially never ask again), they don't feel closer after any rare incidence of sharing or showing emotion, in fact they feel more distant, and may even fade out at that point. They can probably remember a time where they just, out of the blue, stopped loving someone for seemingly no reason at all. Some of my friends who fit the first list are extremely kind and giving folk who have never had a relationship, or who have a strong aversion to monogamy, or who only have casual sex (but these types will **always** tell you so they don't have to feel guilt!) The second, cold, type avoid intimacy by dehumanising you altogether and will just mess you around then blame you for making too many ""assumptions"". These types both have the same fears, it's just that one's narcissistic too."
Noah + Allie from *The Notebook*. People think it's super romantic when it's actually toxic and shitty.
Sounds about right to me. Never met a girlfriend but I met Emma his assistant many times and she can be just as nasty and cold as he can.
"Once Castle and Beckitt actually got into a relationship they were pretty terrible. The writers kept turning them into caricatures in order to manufacture drama between them. It probably didn’t help that something occurred between the actors, but they should have just ended the show rather than keep them both miserable."

"I have a girlfriend and my husband supports it but is not involved in anyway (no we've never threesome'd nor does he want to). My husband is no longer interested in sex in anyway but still loves me deeply and I love him. We are still insanely in love and affectionate with each other. Divorce was not an option but I didn't sign up for a life of celibacy nor did I want random sex with strangers. I like women, so a girlfriend works well for me. She was married when we began this arrangement and her spouse was supportive and encouraging as well. But they recently separated (not because of this arrangement, it's complicated and involves domestic violence 😬). Having me during this time has helped that as well. It works for us and my husband are happier than ever! He isn't pressured to perform when he doesn't want to (nor can he if he wanted to), I'm not bitter or sexually dissatisfied, and we can both be present in our marriage in ways that matter more. "
That's a problem for a lot of people who grow up either food insecure or eating really poorly. Adults who reach higher socioeconomic status later but grew up poor are more likely to be obese than adults who grew up food secure.
"A lot of people in poverty end up smoking, drinking, or falling into addiction because they're self medicating for either a chronic illness or mental health issue. 

""Just go see a therapist if you're feeling depressed/anxious/manic/etc"" isn't a possibility when you live in a state that didn't expand medicaid, when going to treatment would bankrupt you (and you'd lose your low-wage job because there's no PTO), and when the only low-income clinic is 3 hours away by city bus. 

Liquor is cheaper than anti-depressants."
"I know! Like also if I go over to theirs, what if they lock me into a room or something? I'm never going to go to someone's place the first time I meet them but some people get so offended? "
"Here is America, your credit score rules your life. And the easiest way to build up credit is through credit cards. If it's low then your life is substantially harder. You can even lose out on jobs because of a low credit score. You can't get a car or house loans without a good score. Rentals will reject you and you'll be stuck in unsavory places because of it. People see a bad credit score and think ""oh they're really irresponsible"". 

"
"I hate it when people equate what you look like to what your profession is/should be. I'm a 5'3"" female with pink hair and I'm the senior mechanical engineer at my company. 

Last year I was at my uncle's 85th birthday party and was mingling with a few of his old colleagues from [Engineering Firm];  Not one of them was under 75. My aunt walked up, put her are around me and said to these guys ""looking at her, can you believe she's an engineer?"" I was so angry, but before I could say anything, one of the guys snapped back ""I don't know, what does an engineer look like?""

I ended up changing tables during dinner to sit with those guys instead of my family. "
"Situationships. This differs from a 'friends-with-benefits' situation where both parties know they're only interested in sex but not romance.

I know a lot of women who are 'friends' with their crushes, happily have sex and assume emotional labor usually reserved for a relationship, but their crush has no interest in a relationship and it's all murky. Thus, months and years are wasted on a man who sees you as a cool back-up. 

It's sad to see my friends like this. Like everyone knows that fuckboy who uses you because you're convenient, but yet you're also allowing this to continue for so long..?

I ain't judging FWB situations because youre not obligated to be in a relationship to have sex. But once you start giving away the emotional side, it's selling yourself short.

If I like someone, I'll make it clear. And if we start having sex, I'll make it clear I'm looking for X, Y, and Z and if you can't give me that, I wish you the best but peace out."

"One of my old friends had to explain to his fiancé how sex works.. This girl was 23 and had never had the sex talk, or even knew what orgasms were. They were both very sheltered growing up, and neither of them had their first kiss until their wedding day. 
Still makes me cringe every time I think about it. "
"I find it really disappointing when I hear grown women who have wildly incorrect assumptions or gaps in knowledge about their own anatomy or health. It speaks to a pretty sheltered upbringing and terrible education.

I've heard women who think tampons will make them lose their virginity, birth control is like getting an abortion, sleeping with multiple men will make you ""loose"", vaginas shouldn't have any smell and douching is good for you, etc."
"I am 11 years older than my husband, I have a doctorate to his bachelors degree, and I make more money than he does.

"YES! He was playing a show at the casino I used to work at. He arrived at like 6 am on a Friday. Now, we're talking a casino in a town of roughly 2000 people. He RAN into the hotel lobby with his hood pulled up and sunglasses on and ran all the way to his hotel room. Seriously, it's 6 am. nobody gives a shit."
"How’s this? One daughter with an epidural and one without. I’ve now also been present during my best friend’s and daughters labors. Labor isn’t fun, but it also isn’t the world ending horrible scream-fest you see on tv or movies. I was so scared I wasn’t going to make it through. I thought (&amp; had been told always) that I wasn’t a very strong person and I was terrified of labor. 

But— It’s bearable and millions of women do this every year. Your body is literally made to do this and you *will* get through it. There is such an amazing feeling of strength once you hold your new child. Rather you have medication, c-section or whatever, you’ll be in awe that you are so much stronger than you ever imagined. It’s kinda like realizing you have an inner Wonder Woman. Please don’t focus on the horror stories. You’re going to be okay. "

"I kinda wanna piggy back on this, when they plonked my son on me I felt...nothing.

It was like ""oh he's here, man I want a nap now."" Thinking back, there was no real rush of love liked I'd heard. I was aware it was a baby, and aware that I was now mom, but that was it.

This can be normal, and it's okay but you need to monitor it. I love my kid to bits, but it took time for me to love him and for that bond to grow. "
"It’s so weird and kinda icky how people suddenly feel the need to prod into your sex life once you get married. It’s like a socially acceptable way of asking people, “hey, is he cumming inside of you yet?”"

"I worked with him too and completely agree. It's like he really likes being known but hates the work that comes with the fame. Seems to have contempt for anyone who idolizes him while expecting to always be idolized. He does save it for behind the scenes most times I think, though, as he's met my kids here and there and he was fine to them. "
I really think this is because of the massive proliferation of pornography on the internet. More and more young boys are getting their ideas of what is acceptable and normal sex from porn.

"Some version of “It’s better to be in a relationship with a bad person than to be alone.”

Fuck that shit. 

But I see it everyday on r/relationships... people slogging through awful relationships with people they are completely incompatible with, because in their minds being miserable in a relationship &gt; being miserable single. Not sure why the only options they give themselves involve being miserable, but whatever. To each their own."
"Or when you say ""it's too expensive"" and someone says ""it's worth it!"" 

I think of myself as middle class because of my accent and the culture I was brought up in, but financially we were working class (this stuff gets really confusing in the UK - it doesn't really have anything to do with money anymore), so went to uni on a means-tested grant for low income families who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it.

When I went on to do my masters, I worked hard to get a merit-based scholarship so I would be able to afford a postgraduate degree (otherwise entirely unaffordable) but the scholarship only went up to a certain amount of money. My tutor at the time was pressing me to go to Goldsmiths, the fees for which exceeded my scholarship funds. I said: ""It's too expensive"" she said ""It's worth it!"", I said: ""*No, I mean I literally do not have access to that money!*""

Same thing would happen with friends at school. We'd go clothes shopping and I'd say I don't  have money to buy but would like to hang out and try stuff on. They'd say, ""Oh it's ok, you can owe me"" and I would say: ""*No, I mean I do not have access to money to buy these clothes EVER*"""
"I think it was Aziz that I heard on an interview not too long ago that said he doesn't do pictures anymore.  He thinks that people are so worried about getting the ""moment"" online and it makes people not present.  He prefers to look someone in the eye/shake their hand... whatever and make a human connection.  "
"I was a really awkward kid and teenager and glo’d up late - plus the way I grew up didn’t really expose me to men. So in retrospect I think guys started looking at me as an attractive female prospective partner around 17 - I just wasn’t conscious of the attention until I was about 22 because I’m dumb.

There was one time where an older male, maybe late 20s, tried to stick his hand up my skirt at an arcade when I was around 7, so in terms of the predatory stuff, yeah. A lot earlier."
I can’t even count how many guys will be like let’s do a threesome and then say that I should just bring a friend. Like I have a friend I do threesomes with?? 
"Violence, cheating or other abusive behaviors."
"I grew up in a beautiful mountain town in Canada when I was a kid/preteen and all of my rich friends were snowboarders. I remember all the time being asked why I didn't snowboard, since it was so amazing. Hundreds for a pass, plus clothes, plus board, plus transport? That's why I didn't."
"Just want to say that the women here that have shared their stories - holy hell, you are incredible.  I used to be of the opinion that no woman deserves a medal for getting pregnant and giving birth, and all mammals do it so no childbirth is NOT some magical mystical miracle.  But reading these stories.....wow.  Nothing but props and respect all around. It's insane that no one talks about these issues, or that they're so often just brushed off.

For me personally, the list of why I'll never have a child or give birth is only growing.  Because I'm selfish and a weenie and scared of pain.  Shout out to all the women who power through it anyway to raise the next generation."
That dude is nuts. I can't stand to watch anything he's in because I'll never unsee the creepy Scientology propaganda videos where he's talking about how he can stop car crashes and stuff.
"I told him it's okay because I am older and have been going to school, he hasn't decided what he wants yet. My mom and dad hate that I am the breadwinner and think I should marry someone rich who will take care of me. Then I remind them that they raised me to take care of myself. "
"He's my best friend! He thinks it's cute that I'm a little weird and nerdy. He makes me laugh non stop and he's GORGEOUS. He's smart, caring, charming, masculine. I can't get enough of him. "
"That’s me! I’m 54 and got it done when I was 21. I made the right decision then and never regretted it. They have changed shape a bit over the years (age, weight loss/gain, two pregnancies) but they still look better now than they did at 21. If you are considering it, I made a detailed post a few years ago about it. "
"the Goddess of Retroactive Shame. lay upon my altar your old guy fawkes masks, naruto headbands, and printouts of cringey AIM roleplays. i will bless you by erasing the memory"
"Have you seen [Pop Culture Detective's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-hOigoxHs) two videos on The Big Bang Theory? They're both excellent. 

I was never a fan but couldn't quite put my finger on specific reasons. After I saw those I was like yep, that just about covers it."
"You don't have to be on your period to cry over that. Trust me, I know."

"Arrogance, aggression, misogyny, and bad manners."
"I automatically hate a guy who wears the outfit composed of a pastel polo shirt, khaki shorts that end 5 inches above the knee, and boat shoes. It's a thing where I live. Does anyone else know what I'm talking about?"
"I donated once to friends, and it's one of the best things I've ever done -- though, like u/Iheartichokeyou, I had no side effects from the drugs, and I understand that some bad ones could have been possible.

Because it was to friends, mine was an open egg donation. We made the decision early on to let any resulting children know all about everything (in age-appropriate terminology), and we met up every time there was medical reason for us to be in the same place. My friends were gay men, and then there was me, and there was a gestational carrier who my fertilized eggs eventually spent nine months with.

I was 22 or 23, and in the US. I had to get a psychological screening to be sure I was mentally okay, and a huge battery of blood tests (but no genetic tests, just a long long questionnaire). I had to stop taking birth control pills, give myself subcutaneous shots of Lupron to stop my cycle, and then get my boyfriend to give me intra-muscular shots of fertility drugs to re-start it in sync with the gestational carrier's and get my eggs going. Something went wrong here and we weren't actually shown how to do the injections, but we got it worked out.

For the retrieval itself I flew to another city, and they gave me full general anesthesia. I got 17 eggs collected, which is  pretty good. Afterward I threw up (stupid anesthesia) but otherwise was back to operational within a day or two. It took about ten days for my period to come back, after which I was able to get back on the pill. Then I sat back to let the news roll in.

My friends now have a lovely girl, who grew up with a picture of me in her room. I've met her several times over the course of her life and she's now 16. Amazingly enough, she's about to come and visit me in about two weeks while she looks at some of the colleges in my area -- it'll be the first time I've met her when she's really grown up and independent enough to have good conversations. I'm really looking forward to learning more about who she's turned out to be, and I expect she's curious about me too. 

ETA: I was paid a token amount -- I believe $2500, which was the lowest the fertility agency we worked with was comfortable with."
"I have friends and family to combat loneliness for the most part.

Judgement? I’m 27 and I’ve never had a guy to call my boyfriend. I hear others say how it’s kind of pathetic, but then look at me and quickly say that “I’m a different story” due to my shyness and “pickiness” in hopes they didn’t offend me.

I just keep telling myself not to compare myself to others and timing is different for everyone.

I’d rather be single than settle."
Fucking Jackie and Hyde. Their relationship made me want to vomit. Hyde lost so much of himself for her and Jackie was SO controlling of him
"i feel you completely. i am more than happy to hold a landlord liable for the house and appliances working. to me it's not throwing money away at all, it's like paying for insurance that magically fixes expensive shit that goes wrong randomly. but i also live in a place where landlords really get their feet held to the fire if they don't do what they're supposed to."
"The man who  molested me comes off as a very charming smooth talker who gets along with everyone on the surface. Below the surface, he is manipulative and gets what he wants at any cost."
"This happens to me all the time and it also shows how men in particular don’t understand the power differential at play.

Nah dude, I’m not going to your house alone when I’ve never met you before?!"

There was a thread a few weeks back of a teenager who used tampons against her mother's wishes and her mom flipped out because her daughter had 'ruined herself down there'. I wonder what happened to that poor girl. 
"Actually respecting you as an equal human being, especially as a colleague or girlfriend/wife. "
"Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy cut me off in traffic once. Taylor Swift bumped into my partner at their siblings’ graduation (from Duke? Notre Dame? I can’t remember) and didn’t say excuse me/sorry/ope.

Most of the celebs I’ve met have been either nice or mundane. I’ve mostly met musicians, but I’ve met a a few celebrity chefs, athletes, politicians, etc."
My bf told me he didn’t believe in ghosts and I lost it

"They were always my couple goals. Loved each other like crazy and had fun together. Supported their children and allowed them to be individuals. Took care of their whole family happily. 

The show and movies didn't have any kind of show cliche that if you think about it is kinda effed up but we accept as a norm. In a lot of shows there's toxic patterns in a lot of characters relationships or shittiness they justify in humor. "
"Masturbate. Seriously, the release of endorphins does amazing things for mind, body and soul. It’s also a great stress reliever."
"Never used one, and I'm nearing 50.  It's a scam. "
"They're easier to sell than ""What up, ugly?!"""
"Yep. I had one c-section and one natural birth. Overall the most excruciating pain was when I was hooked to an electrical double-breastpump hours after the c-section to improve the milk-flow. Those post-birth contractions pulling at the newly sewn-up womb is something I won’t forget. When I had my second child vaginally, I kept comparing the contractions to this and up to the very end thought ‘still not as bad as before, will probably get worse soon’. So to everyone being told they ‘got of easy’ or something, because they had a c-section: you have suffered and succeeded just as much as every other mom! Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. "
"I think part of the difference is that Jaime and Cersei very obviously knew that they were related and they're brother and sister, whereas Jon and Daenerys don't know that they're related plus they're aunt and nephew so there's a little bit more diversity to the DNA there.

(Not that I'm a fan of the pairing, I just see how it's a little less squicky.)"
"We don't really do Valentines day, and we both forget our aniversary just about every year. We are best friends, we love each other and we don't stress ourselves over 'special days'."

"During a high school mock trial competition, I acted as the police detective who had investigated the crime being tried. During my testimony, I mentioned that I was a mother (adding in semi-irrelevant details to testimony was encouraged, so our team would ""stand out""). After the round ended, the presiding judge berated me personally for mentioning children, and said ""my character as the detective lost all credibility as soon as you said that."" He also lectured my (all female) team for choosing a woman to play a detective in the first place.

After the round, all of my coaches/teammates came over and reassured me that what he said was totally out of line and my character was great, but I wanted to cry. That mock trial round was the almost the reason I decided not to go to law school. (Jokes on you, you misogynistic asshole, I'm going anyway. And I'll probably have a kid, too.)"
"Don't mean to brag but ya. I left that kid in the dust. Since we were around the same age, we rode 60's all the way to 250's and I was always a class ahead (ex: I moved up to c class (novice) a year before him and then b class (intermediate) which he never qualified for. His dad tried to become friends with my dad after realizing who was more talented but my dad knew better. "
"When I'm confronting someone about treating me poorly, I try to stick to ""facts only"". You did this. You did this. And you did this. It made me feel this. 

No bringing up stuff I've forgiven, no bringing up their (or my own) insecurities *irrelevant to the argument*, no name-calling, and no bringing other people's opinions - especially if they're mutual friends - into it. "
"Not the most creepy, but creepy still. he literally called me *m'lady* back in 2010....he also felt the need to ""defend my honour"" when another guy addressed me with ""hey whats up"" instead. "
"&gt;I tried to give her a crash course (she was getting married a week after me), but she just got overwhelmed again.

Omg that's so sad! There's no way she was suddenly okay with sex just because she was married. She probably had a rough wedding night. "

"Dick pics, for sure."
"Most guys I've tried dating won't actually plan the dates. I'm talking about even a first or second date. Some have asked me on a date, then when we meet for it they want me to figure out what we should do. Seriously, the date doesn't have to be fancy! Just meeting for coffee would be perfect. If I ask you out, I have a plan. I expect some thought put into it if you ask me out."
He hunches over his food when he eats. Something about it drives me crazy. 
By that logic men would always create massive wars because of their high testosterone levels.
"The idea of parents giving their kids credit cards without telling them what it is confounds me. 

Also why is America so big on credit cards? Wouldnt debit cards be better so youre not paying interest"
I will never understand why rich people expect free shit.
"I've most often been catcalled by groups of men who drive by fairly fast, which leads me to believe that it's a group activity for them, and they never intended to stop even if I had been interested. Additionally, the things that have been yelled at me are most often insulting - not a ""nice legs"" situation, more like being called a slut. 

The few times I have been catcalled by guys driving slowly who are trying to talk to me, my discomfort and unwillingness to engage seemed like something they liked. They laughed at me walking faster, my fear, at 12, 15 years old. If they simply wanted to ask me out, why wouldn't they have driven away after they saw I was ignoring them? 

You may think of it as guys thinking it's a low-risk way of asking women out, but you admit you've never done it. The type of guy who would actually do it is probably a bit different than you, with different intentions. "
and when you finally give birth they say: and know you have to push out the placenta.  my firstborn was a premature and the placenta was twice the size of the baby
Ignore your intuition
"Surprisingly enough it was Jamie Oliver... 


Myself and my brother took two of our cousins (then 5 and 7) to meet him and he outright refused to even look at them let alone answer when they asked a question about cooking...  till he told us to return without ""the brats"". Needless to say we didn't return. It wasn't even a ""no children"" event :/ it was advertised as a ""all ages"" meet and greet. The 5 year old didn't really know what was going on but the 7 year old was very upset and it took a long time to get her to calm down after that. 




Thankfully when we met Gorden Ramsey a year or so later he was much more polite and actually took the time to speak to them :) 


It wasn't a long interaction but made a world of difference to them both.

"I feel like a big problem is that women's pain is ignored.  Too many times I've heard personal stories from friends or read stories on the internet where a woman is complaining of pain and the doctor dismisses it saying it's just a period or women's problems or something, and it ends up being something either fixable or severe (or both)."
"Ghosting. After seeing it happen to someone I knew, it’s horrible and cowardly. If you don’t like someone just tell them. Disappearing forever is awful and no one deserves that! Treat others the way you wanna be treated, that’s all. "
"I just bought my wedding ring set yesterday.  He wanted me to choose and I came up with a pretty specific idea of what I wanted, it ended up having to be custom made.

I went ahead and bought it as I was already in contact with the jeweler about the custom order.  No big deal, he makes more and pays way more toward our daily living expenses so I have the extra money for it.

I am not allowed to open the package when it arrives and there will still be other surprises regarding getting married.

Edit to add: The main stone is not a diamond which, while becoming more mainstream, is still out of the societal norm."
Depends on the guy... I wish some of them would stop.
Bringing babies into a movie theater. I have Netflix and kodi so going to the movies is completely pointless but every once in a while my so and I like to go and get that ridiculously expensive popcorn and soda that just tastes better in the movie theater! The last two times I actually went there were small children crying and I can handle that but it's when they sit there and say sh sh sh sh and they just keep crying!!!!!
"I don't like the idea of starting a relationship as ""friends with benefits"" which seems to be more and more common. There's almost this expectation that you're down to 'keep things casual' for like, 6 months, before you get any sort of commitment."
"I'm a blacksmithing student. I started receiving a bunch of creepy, cringey messages and unsolicited dick pics on Facebook after posting on a blacksmithing page. The guys rallied and started harassing my harassers and my boss spammed my wall with pictures of celebrities named Richard. I've never laughed so hard or felt so included. 😂   "
"&gt; or in some cases aren't) wearing 

Yes! It wasn’t even that cold. Low 50s maybe and my then six month or so old hated socks. I walked the entire 30 feet to the store and the third time he removed his socks, I threw them in my bag.

“That boy needs socks! He’s gonna get frostbite!!!!”

It took a lot of self control to not say something like “ah, yes, I’ve heard of the 30 seconds in 50 degree weather danger of frostbite. But he won’t leave them on! Got a staple gun?”"
