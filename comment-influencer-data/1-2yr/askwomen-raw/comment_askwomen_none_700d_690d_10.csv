When I have hobbies that aren't typically feminine it's cool and people want to talk to me about it. When she has hobbies that aren't typically feminine people think it's weird and move the conversation on.
"Ignore emotional labor, not do their share of housework and then complain about women nagging them. Pro tip: if you are annoyed about your partner asking you multiple times to do something she's way more annoyed at you that she has to ask. "
"Exceptionally unrealistic expectations about the type of person that will go for him. Dude is an overweight, greasy, know-it-all, not social, no real career, condescending type that expects a thin, pretty, social, smart, well read, accomplished lady to wait on him, be patient with his shortcomings, adore his 5 fantasy football leagues, and a series of other problematic attitudes. No sane woman would date him, ever, and it is making him bitter and intolerable"
"Well at least where I am from, huge boobs.  I like boobs just fine, I am just not ever one to grasp why size matters.  You can have really nice boobs of any size.  I can't understand why ""bigger is better"" at all.  I hate that so many celebs and such have implants now.  One of the most beautiful things in life is variety.  We shouldn't *want* all women to look the same.  We should be enjoying the differences."
Holding standards in partners they themselves don't meet. 
"I fall in bed exhausted still wearing clothes and fall asleep telling myself I am just laying down for a second. I wake up at three am needing to pee, bush my teeth, and take off my pants. Then go back to sleep.

My routine could be better."
"They insist that their girlfriend engage in their hobbies (not necessarily participate, but at least learn about), but won't engage in any of hers.  Guys will justify it as ""I'm teaching her so that we'll have something we can do together/talk about"", which is totally fine, but the entire concept of them taking up one of her hobbies so that they have something to do together hasn't even occurred to them.  This is especially true if the woman has traditionally feminine hobbies, but in my experience it tends to be true even if she has fairly gender-neutral or ""masculine"" hobbies.  You get guys on this website all the time insisting that their gfs don't even have hobbies, which is super unlikely, because they pay so little attention when she talks about them that they don't even know they exist.         "
"In the beginning of our relationship, he tried to plan a perfect date all catered to me, and it went horribly wrong. 

Tried to go to my favorite restaurant - it was closed.

Tried to go watch sunset on the beach - it was a cloudy day.

Tried to redeem himself and take me to movies - car broke down. 

But he tried so hard and he was so nervous, sweaty, and bummed that it all didn't pan out that I knew he was the one haha been together for 8 years now. 

The one with the clammy hands and red ear tips from embarrassment? That one's mine, ladies haha "
"Yesterday we went and grabbed lunch and I was feeling overwhelmed from a couple of different things and I started crying randomly. I very rarely cry so it even took me by surprise. His brain shortcircuited for a moment before he tried to give me the last bite of his brownie. It was adorable. ""Oh no oh no oh no wat do TAKE MY BROWNIE"""
I don't have the courage to talk about my experiences on social media but I'm glad those who have create more visibility. I don't know one woman who hasn't been sexually harassed at one point. For most of us it happened more than once. 
"I had a crush on this guy in high school.  My sister got sick of me talking about him so she dialed his number and handed me the phone when he answered.  He told me to come talk to him on Monday.  I spent all day working up the nerve, then right before the buses came at the end of the day I went up to him and said, ""Hey I'm the girl who called you.""  He goes, ""Oh hey!  What's up?""  I panicked, stared at my feet, then turned around, walked away, and never talked to him again."
When I was in the throes of finishing my masters thesis and very stressed my husband bought me a box of Ferrero rochers since they are one of my favorite candies.  Unbeknownst to me he secretly bought two boxes and replaced the candies slowly as I was eating them so that the box seemed to last forever.  Finally found out when he forgot for two days and I took what I distinctly remembered to be the penultimate rocher and then came home to find the box a third full.  Actually freaked me out but then he confessed.
ya get nekked
"Lying about little things.

This isn't gendered at all, I can't think of an answer to this post that only applies to men but one thing I can not stand but seems to happen all too often is lying about small, inconsequential things. 

Adding to that and also not gendered... telling their friends/family/whoever they can't do something because of their partner when the truth is they just don't feel like going. 

Years back when I was with one of my exes, I was at his family's place for dinner and his brother made a comment about wanting him to go watch a hockey game. He then added a comment like, ""if she'll let you"" (referring to me). I thought it was a bit odd so I said I would never tell him he can't do something and that a hockey game would be a good time. His brother gave me one of those, ""Sure, okay"" type of answers. 

After a conversation later that evening, it turns out that I was ALWAYS his excuse when he just didn't feel like being social. Not cool. His family and friends probably thought I was some psycho all because he didn't want to be honest and just say he didn't feel like going out."
"People tend to walk in between me and her when we’re talking to talk to me. It’s an instant no. Disrespect my friend, you disrespect me."
"Those ultra-sleek, curvy, overly-defined eyebrows (for women). Ugh, I don’t get it. "
Sweet smart guy but a touch socially awakard. Looking for a lovely virgin Catholic girl. Not terrible but he's 40 now and hasn't changed his goal.
"Use shitting on their girlfriends as a way to bond with their bros. Even if you don't mean it when you say it, saying negative things often enough about a person you love will eventually poison that well.

Honest venting can be great, but making your girl a punch line with no intent to cut her loose is not."
"I had to have an abortion when we were both 28, so not incredibly young. We actually wanted to keep the child, but were unable to as it would have resulted in permanent nerve damage for me. We were heartbroken. I think they key for us, though, was being able to talk about it. We both were very open about how we felt and how it was impacting us. This was a year and a half ago, and we still talk about it every so often. Without that, I don’t think our relationship would have survived, honestly.

We knew when it happened that this would either make us stronger as a couple, or tear us apart. We had a serious discussion about it and promised each other we wouldn’t let this get between us. I could see how it could have went that direction. For us, luckily, it didn’t. It actually brought us closer together. We felt if we could get through that loss, we can get through anything. 

I felt a lot of guilt. I felt like it was my fault, that I couldn’t carry it. I still feel like that sometimes, but whenever I get those feelings, I just tell my SO I’m feeling down about it. This might sound silly, but we gave the baby a nickname, which made it easier for us to talk about it. So instead of saying “I’m feeling bummed about the abortion,” or “I’m feeling guilty about the baby,” I say “I’ve been thinking a lot about PB lately” and he knows what I mean. It just made it easier for us to discuss it openly. 

We got engaged a month after the abortion, and got married this past summer. We’re talking about starting a family now, but we certainly haven’t forgotten what could have been. 

I hope some of this is helpful. Wishing you both the best of luck.

"He has seen my anxious breakdowns and has only offered support and love when they happen. I tend to hide my bad emotions because I don't want to burden anyone else, and when I admitted one time that I was extremely stressed, he looked genuinely sad that I didn't confide in him. He was like, ""You can always tell me when you're having a hard time. I just want to help you and make sure you're in a good place. Here, let's sit down and come up with a plan..."" and I just wanted to sob.

My previous boyfriend would tell me to just ""get over it"" and was extremely emotionally distant, so it took a few months for me to get used to being treated like a human."
YES. Thank you. I can't count the number of times the girl next to me has been called fascinating when I was just called weird for saying literally the exact same thing.
"Back when we werent living together and I was struggling with money/starting a new job, I told him I started my period in our nightly phonecall. He asked if I had enough tampons and I said that while I didnt, I would just use toilet paper until payday. He was fussy but I told him Id be ok. 
I woke up to a shopping bag tied to my rearview mirror with a little note, apparently he had driven over at like 3am and dropped them off for me so he wouldn't wake me up, I saw that and I cried ;u;
We're getting ready to get married now &lt;3"
"Shes really overweight and is *too* close to her family. She also has her engagement ring planned out... which will cost upwards of $15,000. ""If he really loved me..."" etc."
"
Being unattached/unemotional. 

Men are described as being cool &amp; logical while woman get lumped as being cold &amp; heartless. "
Really muscular men. Blegh
I am acknowledged more than she is. Men ask only me questions even if she's standing next to me. I always respond for us both but it's sad that she has to go through that. She is an amazing specimen
"- Gym bodies. I don't consider them unattractive, necessarily (though muscle definition becomes so after a certain point). They just don't do anything for me.

- Wealth. Money doesn't make a person smart, interesting, or funny.

- Most dudes in Hollywood. They all have the same bland look. I'd rather see something a little physically odd that sets a man apart from Chris, Chris, Chris, Ryan, Ryan, etc."
Alot of people will disagree with me on this but I dislike the shaving of pubic hair completely bald. Trimmed neatly looks so much better. Just my opinion!
Not talking about their feelings. It results in poor communication in the relationship as a whole.
"One of my best friends is LEAGUES more attractive than I am, and frankly, its usually the most attractive woman anywhere we go. 

She knows she is, but is SUPER cool about it. I get used to guys trying to be ""friendly"" with me to get an 'in' with her. She knows its happening too, so she will usually say ""well, you're not buying a drink for me if you aren't buying one for all of my friends too.""

She always wants to sit at the VIP tables of whatever venue we are in to score good service and free drinks... So she will tell the rest of the group ""Wait here, I'm going to get us into VIP!"" and she will just go stand near the VIP sections and within a few moments, they try to usher her in -- and she grabs the rest of us to join her. 

I'm not mad about it, and neither are any of us. I know that in many places, I'm pretty! But next to her, I don't even register. That's fine with me - I'm happy to accept casual conversation from the wingman, get free drinks and go home to my man at the end of the night!

I have a friend who's only real problem is that he is disfigured and people have a hard time looking at him. He is the funniest and most awesome guy I know but its just so hard to get people to give him a chance.
"Joke about their partners being a drag or a ball and chain or whatever it is these days, or laugh at their friends making those jokes."
"We went to Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles for one of our first dates. For those who don’t know, it’s at the very top of a hill and oftentimes people have to park at the very bottom and hike up to the observatory. In the 90s you’d bring a flashlight with you because once it got dark, you could easily trip and fall to your death on your way back to the car. 

Anyway, we were in the gift shop and I saw these ADORABLE stuffed planets — every one, plus the sun and the moon, all in different sizes and all with arms and eyes and oh my goodness SO cute. I fawned over them a bit, and then we moved on. 

Several months later I open up one of my christmas presents to find the stuffed sun and stuffed moon from the observatory. I was so surprised that he remembered that I wanted them, and even more surprised that he didn’t order them online like a normal person. No. 

He left work early one day, drove across LA to the observatory, hiked up the hill to the gift shop, and bought them for me. Not only that, but they ran out of bags and he had to carry them all the way back down the side of the mountain, past the people walking up. A big, burly, bearded dude hiking down a mountain carrying stuffed animals under his arms.... what a sight it must have been. 

I love this man. "
"This is kind of an interesting question to me, because the fact is I only feel unsafe when my Spidey senses are tingling, which is not often. But at the same time, I do little things that I'm not sure men ever do, like make sure my keys are out before I get to the door, park my car where my neighbor can see me getting in and out, check the backseat every time, and so on. Traveling in packs to the bathroom at a bar or club is another one.

So while I don't always consciously feel unsafe, I am always practicing situational awareness; I travel alone a lot too and while I have no issue getting around unfamiliar towns, I definitely won't turn down a street if it gives me the heebie jeebies. Even in broad daylight. Consciously I'm not afraid but subconsciously I'm trying to keep an eye on things and when my gut tells me something is off, I listen."
"My time to shine.

* Bus driver missed my stop after I pulled the cord to notify him I needed to get off. Instead of saying something, I rode to the next stop, which happened to be the end-of-the-line. Proceeded to walk home from that stop with a gigantic bag of groceries in tow.
* Randomly got sick while on an outing with my friends. They were in another room, and I just got that urge I had to throw up out of nowhere. Proceeded to throw up in my purse, and just left. Turned phone off to ignore calls from them wondering where I went.
* Ordered pizza from the shop down the street. They never showed up, I never called to question where it was, and was charged for the pizza. At least it went towards my free pizza points, lol.
* Started period while at work, didn't have any backup tampons. Instead of asking one of my female co-workers, who would have totally given me one, I proceeded to just use the toilet paper method for the remainder of the day.
* It's lunch time. There are other co-workers making food in the kitchen. I will wait the entirety of my lunch if I have to, just to avoid having to go in there and make small-talk.

I could go on and on.

"Her ex, the father of her child, is crazy.  When she's dated a guy for long enough for it to get serious, her ex reports the guy for abusing his daughter.  The reports are false and disproved but no one wants to deal with that shit (which is completely understandable).  The last guy went through the first round of false accusations but the second round included molestation allegations so then he was out."
Height. I don't dislike tall men or anything but height in a partner has just never mattered that much to me I guess.
Getting a tan or even a fake tan. With a real one all I can think of is how they're going to look like a leather handbag one day and the cancer possibilities. With the fake all I can think about is how orange they look.
Assertiveness.
"When my boyfriend is super-stressed or under a lot of pressure, he ends up sucking his thumb while sleeping. 

The only people who know this are his mum and me. 

I've actually seen the whole process- he falls asleep, he starts frowning and muttering in his sleep, his thumb sneaks in, his face relaxes completely. 

I find it so fucking adorable. But I'm not gonna tell him in case he starts feeling insecure about it and tries to stop."
"The woman tries to tell him, up front, why she's unhappy with something or why she would like him to do XYZ.  He ignores it as ""nagging.""  Then when she's finally had enough and either dumps him and/or snaps and starts yelling, she's ""crazy"" or he becomes the victim because she ""left for no reason.""

I love how the guys on MRP get upset over women divorcing their husbands for ""no reason"" but also can't comprehend that the ""nagging"" was the reason.  SHE TOLD YOU THE REASON YOU JUST DIDN'T LISTEN THE FIRST 500 TIMES."
"To be more precise than assertive: taking lead in a situation where you're not de facto in charge. There have been many instances where I've been on equal or better ground when it came to dealing with an issue, only to have my ideas spoken over or met by silence. "
"Bad communication. If you and your partner can't communicate for some reason, issues never get fully resolved and things end up building up until the inevitable end of the relationship."
"Some indie shitheads promised me if I wrote a script, they'd make it into a short film series.

Wrote several episodes, spent countless hours going over characters and plot threads and moulding this awesome world. They were with me every step of the way, encouraged me, were decent soundboards as I launched ideas at them, pointed me toward screenwriting books for advice. 

Four months into the project - indie guys had even done actor interviews, and decided on the main cast, and we had done a small fundraiser to get some better lighting equipment.... 

They dropped me from the group. 

Decided their writer buddy would take over as the main writer and I'd be dropped from the project, and set as a co-writer for the first episodes I WROTE ON MY GODDAMN OWN. They kicked me out of the facebook chat, the group, and I stopped receiving texts after the one FACEBOOK message that I was being dropped for no fucking reason.  They planned to continue the project with my work and give me shit credit. 

Nu-uh, that shit would not fly. 

So, I went into the site we'd been hosting the script I WROTE, THANK YOU, and copied it all into my personal google docs. Deleted everything. They have *nothing* of mine. Their project ground to a halt and they only puttered around for a few more days before dropping off the face of the planet. 

Every once in a while I remember the cold feeling of justice and it feels so good~

"She's extremely shy, to the point that she has exactly three friends and has not made a new friend in over 15 years. She refuses to leave her house, and won't even meet new people (even if I am there to break the ice).

I worry a bit about her, but she's happy with how her life is right now, so I'm happy."

"I question my own experiences compared with other women... I guess I don't know if my experiences are ""enough"" to speak on publicly. I have never been assaulted but of course have experienced instances of leering glances and catcalling. I guess I feel as though my participation would trivialize the posts of others who have faced so much more, so I am uncomfortable participating."
"Perfect white teeth. Unique teeth, wonkiness and all, give people character and make their smiles adorable."
"I have a friend very much like that; incredibly funny, smart, awesome, but a pretty dramatic facial deformity.

"I was at my ex's house, he lives with his family. His parents came home while I was in their computer room on the main floor, and they started talking about wondering where my ex was. He had gone out to pick up a friend for a DnD session, but I stayed behind to finish some job application. Anyway, I was too awkward to walk out and greet his parents, so they thought they were alone and were super shocked when they walked into the computer room to find me just awkwardly staring at the doorway."
It's a running battle between sloth and gluttony. 
I saw my old married professors sneaking a cute lil kiss when they probably thought no one was around. They're normally really stoic and serious so it was fucking adorable. 
Ditto. I have big boobs and they make me feel (and look) a lot fatter than I actually am. Plus regular pain and discomfort isn't sexy.
"I *know* I have loads of these. They usually come back to me in the middle of the night. But at the moment I can only think of one. I tend to overthink things so much that I convince myself that my initial instinct (which is *always* the socially appropriate thing to do) is actually the socially inappropriate thing to do. 

So this time I was out hiking with friends and we had two dorms at the hostel. The other dorm was mixed gender and I was going to them to ask them something. I went to the dorm room, stopped at the door and my brain did something like this:

ME: Best knock.

ME2: OMG! No! Everyone's going to think you're weird!

ME: What if they're changing?

ME2: It's a mixed dorm, dickhead, there's girls in there too.

ME: It won't do any harm if I knock.

ME2: Everyone's going to think there's something wrong with you if you knock, seriously, they're going to think you're weird. It's weird to do that.

ME: Are you *sure* about that? That doesn't sound...right...

ME2: I have never been more certain in my life.

*I open door without knocking*

*Screams of horror from within*

*Semi-clothed men scramble*

THEM: What the fuck are you doing?! Why didn't you knock?!

ME: I...I have no idea..."
I don't have kids or a SO.  Every moment not at work is a moment I can do whatever I want.  
"Not sure if this question was meant for my situation, but I had an abortion at 21 weeks pregnant for a wanted baby. She wasn't going to survive, she was going to be in pain. I decided on the D&amp;E to save her and me pain, and me heartache. 

When we heard the news about our baby, the first thing I said to my husband was, ""WE ARE GOING TO BE OKAY."" That was my drive and my motivation and my overriding goal when things got hard. 

And we were. We took about a month and a half off of work to be together and mourn for our baby. We agreed that we wouldn't hide our grief, wouldn't put up a front and then go cry in the shower. We fought, comforted each other, cried together, laughed in the little moments that you can forget. 

Ten years later, we are stronger than ever. We have two beautiful girls. We have everything we ever wanted. We still think about it, but it's more like a sad time in our lives than the all-encompassing grief we felt at first. When the anniversary rolls around, sometimes we don't even remember until someone mentions it. 

I'm so thankful we had the option to end the pregnancy like we did. But it was beyond horrible to have to walk through the protesters screaming ""MURDERERS!!!"" at us. They followed us home. Papered our door with anti-choice literature and photos. Brought fear and even more sadness on the worst day of our lives. 

And even with all of that, I'd do it again in a heartbeat. "
"Oh, if you’re the ugly one people will let you know your whole life."
"Every time someone in a meeting asks me if I want a tea or coffee and I say no because idk, I don't want to put them out or something and then I spend the whole meeting thinking about how I really wanted a tea. "
"Avoiding emotional labor.

No, I don't want to be the only person making all the social plans, keeping the grocery list updated, making sure there's cash on hand for the random school fees, etc etc etc."
"Oh my god. Yes. I'm currently living in this messy nightmare and I actually don't know how to fix it. I just want to live in a clean house, but we both live here so why am I doing 100% of the work and he gets to reap the rewards? I don't know how else to have the conversation. "
Guys tended to fuck and chuck her quite often. Made me sad because she is beautiful in non-conventional ways and was an amazing human being. I didn't know why I deserved all the flowers and being brought home to mom while she always got thrown away. I'm glad she found a decent dude who appreciates her.
"This is my friend. She is a bit below average. Not hideous but defiantly not eye-dropping gorgeous. She always goes after above-average guys. The average looking guys who hit on her, she declines to even talk or date them."
"A lot of women are telling you about consent, and that’s absolutely the right direction to go, but I’m going to try to make it simpler than that. 

Don’t approach a woman in a sexual nature unless you have established an interaction that allows it. A good rule of thumb is to literally approach a woman like she’s a human and not a walking set of boobs and body parts. I’ve had my fair share of street harassment, or men aggressively approaching me in bars, clubs, restaurants, on the train, whatever, and the only time I havent felt violated is a when a man has told me “I think you’re beautiful/nice/smart, may I talk to you/buy you a drink/sit next to you?” and if I say No, he accepts it and leaves. If I say yes, then the conversation continues and basic conversational etiquette follows - the best approach is to not use sexual language *unless prompted.* I know this primarily gives women the control in an initial interaction and this bothers some men, but I think the overwhelming majority of us find a man who waits for us to set boundaries as attractive and a “good guy.” This also doesn’t mean you have to do this for the rest of your relationship or friendship with the woman - the most attractive thing about my boyfriend was that he did not sexualize me at all when we first met, I felt safe with him and trusted him, but several days, weeks or months into the relationship, he obviously makes his fair share of sexual comments and it’s fine, awesome, even. 

Ultimately, going up to a woman and commenting on her sexual or physical traits is not welcome, nearly always, and even if it is, your safest approach is to be respectful and then use basic social and observational skills to levy whether you can comment on her “sexiness” or whatever. When a woman expresses a desire not to talk you, move on, accept her “no,” and don’t try to convince her otherwise. The kind of men who are persistent or think they can chip away at a woman’s disdain are creepy and can make a woman feel alarmed and defensive quickly. Just be socially aware and take cues initially from the woman, respect her choice to disengage with you if she wants to, and respect her as a person."
I have a stone that keeps tigers away. Never had a problem with tigers around my house after I bought it.
I have a handful of religious girlfriends who are waiting and have very strong beliefs that men do the asking out. 
"Oh God, I'm having a deja vu moment reading this. Someone that was a friend and is now an acquaintance due to these qualities. He tried to put every female in our circle down for things that are ridiculous (e.g. being too tall for a girl, not a real gamer, too little makeup, too much makeup...), even though he had not a single tiny bit of right to comment on these things. 

I mean you can work on the looks department. A lot of guys clean up decently if they just got a good haircut and maintain good hygiene. You can learn to be social. But if you're an a**hole.... you can't be seriously wondering why repeatedly all new women you meet through your hobbies and friend circle don't touch you with a ten foot pole."
A guy groped my ass at a Costco and I said sorry as if I bumped into him because I didn't know how to respond.
"1. Be in college  
2. Go to Whole Foods (already dumb)  
3. Pick a normal-looking bottle of wine that appears to be about $8 
4. Pay for said wine anyways when it rings up at the register as $75+"
"not a physical attribute, but i don’t understand the attraction to men or women with nice cars. it’s just never impressed me "
"She uses her powers for good, to make sure her friends enjoy themselves too."
"I've been the ugly friend! We were out at a club and my attractive friend got approached by no less than half a dozen guys in the span of idk an hour? She kept turning them away because she was trying to be a good friend to us, but at some point I told her ""Ya know, if they offer you a drink, I'll gladly take it off your hands..."" and then she got me a drink xD. Thanks, attractive friend &lt;3!  

Oh but in terms of how I got treated differently, it was just that I wasn't approached. That's all. I was still just dancin' next to them and having a good time. "
"I recently had a guy open with ""girls usually feel jealous around hotties, so why do you have so many friends?""

Good grief guys can be idiots."
"So true! I find that men can be really demeaning about traditional feminine hobbies as well, especially when we put money into them. I like high end makeup and I've had guys comment about the amount I spend. Like you'll blow $800 on a computer, or $200 on tickets to a sports game, or whatever for your hobbies. I work hard and my bills are paid so I'm gonna buy that eyeshadow if I want to! Luckily my current SO supports my hobbies. "
"This could go for any gender, but I have personally experienced a lot of guys who think of a girlfriend as more of an accessory and less of a partner.

When they're single, they care more about ""getting a girlfriend"" (filling the void) rather than meeting someone they like and developing relationships naturally. They insist on knowing her whereabouts, but don't always share their own. They feel like they have to ""take care of"" her, or pay for her, or don't want to ""share"" her with others."
"I guess I've been pretty lucky with roommates...but the worst one was sophomore year of college when I moved out of the dorm and into an apartment for the first time. My mom knows tons of people and somehow hooked me up with the daughter of one of her acquaintances who was also needing a roommate. 

Even though we had very little in common, things seemed to go smoothly at first. She had quite a bit of money and used it to make the apartment common areas look nice, which I appreciated since I was extremely poor at the time. 

We didn't really speak much, but we lived in quiet harmony for a while. We were both kind of introverted, so it was very peaceful except on the rare occasion when her friends would come over before going out. She never had friends over to just hang out at the apartment. Overall, very minimal annoyance, almost zero conflict, A+ roommate experience. 

Until it started to become apparent there was something just slightly off about her. She was very nice, extremely gorgeous, soft spoken, and a little shy and reserved. But, the longer we lived together, the more I began to wonder if there was more to her (or not). 

She walked around the apartment like a zombie, blank stare, dazed look. And we never, and I mean NEVER, had any conversations of any depth whatsoever. Nothing other that the most surface level. Most of the time we just didn't speak at all. It wasn't like we hated each other, we just had nothing to talk about. Being a private person, I'm okay with not sharing things with people, but something about this struck me as odd.  

She did not know how to cook, which is fine, but she would try all the time and make a horrible mess, burn things, smell up the apartment. She **never** got flustered though...she would just keep trying. So to keep this from happening I would usually just cook enough for both of us and keep things in the fridge to share. 

I also started noticing that she was leaving the apartment door unlocked almost every day when she would go to class. I mentioned it to her, but each time she would just kind of get this blank look on her face again as if she was only slightly aware of what I was telling her. 

She tried to do her part to help keep the apartment clean, but it's like she had no idea what she was doing. She once sprayed some kind of bathroom cleaner on the TV and completely ruined the screen (that's okay! she just bought a new one), she also tried to use that same cleaner on our **fabric** couch...

I always felt kind of bad for her, because it was like she had the best intentions, but just wasn't very competent. I also was kind of disturbed by some of her actions because she just seemed...hollow. Like a shell of a person. Sometimes I even wondered if she was on drugs that were keeping her in a daze all the time, or if she was just like that normally. 

The last straw happened though over a long weekend break. We both went home for the weekend. She left after me and I returned before her.

When I got back and walked up to the door, I felt like something was off. There was a strange kind of smell and I knew something was wrong even before I opened the door. When I walked in, I was hit by a wave of heat and the smell of smoke. I ran into the kitchen to find that she had left a pan of (what I think were) chicken nuggets in the oven **for the entire long weekend**. Like, just put some in the oven, forgot about them, and left town for the weekend. 

They had been reduced to little piles of black charcoal and the pan was all twisted and distorted looking. It terrified me. It was something like 100 degrees F in the apartment.  

When I told her about it, she just kind of looked at me blankly and laughed this hollow laugh. ""Oops,"" she said. 

I moved out at the end of the semester and got a new roommate. "
"I think it's healthy to break down the stigma of it. On reddit (yes a very narrow part of society) on any thread about women's sexual harassment there's always a hefty dose of ""she's overreacting"" or ""she's probably a slut who liked the attention."" Hopefully if these guys start to see that their mums and sisters and teachers and idols can post ""me, too"" they'll stop excusing it or dismissing it."
The other day I went to bed at 8
"That you have to be super attractive, in-shape, and successful to get a date and everyone else is doomed to be alone forever.

Do you ever just walk around in public and see the kind of people around you who have wedding rings on or are clearly with somebody? I mean, not to diss these people, but there are a lot of individuals who are *definitely* not ""10s"" who have still found companionship."
"He is more interested in the idea of the ""perfect girl"" than the girl herself. Like, he wants a girl who loves his favorite band too, who likes the same music and movies, who fits into his scene. On the surface that doesn't sound too bad. It's not wrong to want someone to share your interests. But he is so focused on those qualities that it comes across as he wants those qualities only and won't compromise for anyone different. As if those qualities are what defines this girl. No girl will ever live up to the imaginary girl he has dreamed up. 

I've tried explaining it to him. Don't look for a girl who loves your favorite band. Look for the girl who loves how much you love your favorite band. My husband and I have vastly different interests, but we still enjoy our time together and love each other for who we are. "
"Man here. But I've noticed that people don't seem to see women as competent in a technical sense. I'm a coder and I see this a lot. We have female devs and whenever they make a change that's outside requirements, they gotta fight tooth and nail for their case. Me? I make a change and it's always ""Well, we'll see how it goes!"" That's messed up...  they're solid coders, arguably better than myself... It's dumb."
"Complacency. I think that a lot of times people forget that work needs to be put in to keep things interesting and fun once the honeymoon phase is done. You get comfortable, which is great, but then you stop trying, stop talking to each other and learning new things about each other, stop the nice dates, etc. then suddenly you find yourself restless and bored and that eventually devolves into just feeling sick of being around your SO, and you wonder how you got there. "
"On the cheeks, not much. Between the cheeks it's a jungle, man. "
"Stop putting in effort past the honeymoon phase - remembering favorite things, considering their schedules/interests when planning things (or stop planning things all together), small gestures of ""hey I was thinking about you"", etc. You may see this referred to as emotional labor and it tends to fall heavily on the woman in a heterosexual relationship. 

Pre-emptively: this isn't about Christmas cards, alright? "
"I unsew the hems of my shorts, use the bathroom, then sew them back on. easy peasy "
"Also: if you say ""I'll help clean up if you just tell me what to do"" you are ignoring emotional labor. An adult human shouldn't need a list from another adult to know what/how to clean. What you have basically said to your spouse is ""you are in charge of cleaning and I will only do what you delegate to me, so there's an extra job for you!""

To be clear I don't mean it's an issue if you have a conversation about division of chores (""you cook, i do the dishes"" etc) I mean when you flat out ask for a list or to be told what needs to be done."
"I met a woman recently who said if a ride g wasn't big enough, she wouldn't marry the guy. Something along the lines of ""how will he support me if he can't afford a nice ring?"" I can't believe she'd say that out loud."
Forgetting that the little things add up.  No one breaks up with someone because they didn't do the dishes last night.  They broke up with them because they didn't do the dishes last night...and every night for the past two years.
"I don't like that look when super muscular guys have huge shoulder muscles, the ones that go from your shoulder to you ear. It looks like their heads are sinking into their torso. "
I’ve not met someone who likes me when I like them. I’m comfortable being single and living my life. I’m not willing to lower my standards just to be in a relationship. I’ve broken up with guys in the past because I’d rather be single then in a shitty relationship or to be treated poorly. 
Blonde hair. Just doesn't do anything for me. 
I'm not a fan of beards.
"Charm.

It just makes me suspicious. I suppose historically a lot of 'charming' or very socially able people I've come across have been manipulative and self centred, so I associate it with negative traits."
"For me, it's just a damn itchy mess for the following weeks after the day of shaving. No thanks."
"How in the winter he scrapes my windows every morning.

How we enjoy cutting each others hair every two weeks.

How we snuggle up and watch anime together.

How he always eats my new creation food even if it tastes bad.

How he will grab my toes in winter in bed and put them against his warm legs so I can warm up.


He's just an all around amazing man "
"This is why even if I'm really only interested in one of the friends, I'll still always talk to both/all of them. I feel it's so disrespectful to just completely ignore someone like that and it's always a bad look when I see it happen. Especially because the girl you're interested in is probably used to a bunch of attention while the girl that's not included probably has barely gotten any all night. 

Fuck that. I'm there to make friends too. I've never regretted talking to everyone instead of just one person. "
"""But you weren't attractive when you said it!"" &lt;/s&gt;"
"I would have murdered my sister if she did that to me. 
"
"I've noticed the same thing! I work in a male dominated field (scientific research) and people I meet in social settings find it fascinating. But some of my female friends at work often get brushed off in social settings if they talk about science. 

I've also noticed over the years people find it ""cool, down to earth etc"" when I say I don't exercise or eat healthy because I genetically have a slim figure. But when my friends who are overweight say the same thing they're ""lazy, unhealthy etc"". 

This is why it makes me mad when people glorify the ""one of the guys"" stereotype. Because the line between being adored or scorned for having male characteristics is how much your body/face looks like the feminine ideal."
"Unequal labour in household chores. Sorry it's not very romantic, but not pulling your weight makes you increasingly unattractive as time goes on..."
"&gt; But it was beyond horrible to have to walk through the protesters screaming ""MURDERERS!!!"" at us. They followed us home. Papered our door with anti-choice literature and photos. Brought fear and even more sadness on the worst day of our lives.

He makes me sandwiches and coffee when he leaves before me in the morning. He will devote time to just sit and talk with me about my day. He goes for walks with me. He talks me out for ice cream. He makes sure I get time with my family and friends. He surprises me with cute texts throughout the day. He cuddles me every night without fail.
They will bring a guy around they are talking to and he tries to hit on me. In what world do they think Id ever be down to hurt my friends feelings and flirt back right in front of her? Sometimes I get so annoyed when their crush will start to like me... no she's so nice and is working her way to a good future ! I'm bitchy and emotionally unavailable!
Still hasn't happened yet because my anxiety was right lol
"I used to have a friend like this. It was like he regressed after high school while the rest of us matured. We drifted apart because got deep into the whole Nice Guy thing and drove a lot of people (myself included) away. We're still friends on Facebook though, and it looks like he's finally growing up. Got into ridonkulous shape and became a martial arts instructor. Went back to school and got his degree. Started immersing himself in feminism and progressive activism, and cleaned up his appearance. (New trendy haircut, started using acne medication, wears jeans and adult shirts instead of sweatpants and graphic tees now) I've had quite a few friends say to me ""When do [male friend] get hot?"" "
I was getting my floors redone and waiting it out in my basement took. I was too embarrassed to ask them to stop so I could use the bathroom so I went outside and peed in my yard. It was not my proudest moment 
For my most recent birthday he wrote me 365 little one-line notes and told me to read one every day until my next birthday. Reading his sweet messages every morning totally makes my day. Hands down the cutest and most thoughtful gift I've ever received. He is definitely a keeper 😊
Still caring about your career &amp; your social life and not just be a spouse &amp; parent after you get married and have kids.
"He made a list of pro/cons with input from others and the con side came out ahead. Was almost swayed by the pro item of ""Partner can take you to the hospital at night if you're incapacitated"", though."
"I've honestly made this a dealbreaker after dealing with this in several relationships. Trying to explain this ended up with the classic ""well, I don't care about the mess so why should I have to clean so much?"" 

Maybe you could have a talk about what chores you hate and which you don't mind doing and try to come up with a way that's fair. I know my SO (who is a beautiful man who cleans circles around me despite my best efforts) has certain chores he hates and I have some that I hate and luckily they don't overlap."
The nice old man the next building over has a crush on the sweet old woman who lives in my building.
"I watch a lot of movies (&lt;3 a month). Before I used to make plans to see them with people. It was such a fucking hassle and people kept showing up late but its a big fucking deal for a 2-2.5 hour movie. So i stopped asking people and started going to movies by myself. One of the weirdest best decisions i ever made. Super liberating, i enjoy myself more, i can go anytime and get on with my day. "
"Long hair on women as the epitome of sexuality. Short hair viewed as ""manly"", ""androgynous"", ""aggressive"" or ""she's gotta be a lesbian""."

"My best friend isn't ""ugly"" but she is definitely very plain. 

When I'm with her people seem to assume that I'm the ""leader"" so they always talk to me and listen to my opinions/input more than they do with her, and they would probably ignore her completely if I wasn't there. It sucks because she is easily the nicest person on the planet and everyone who has met her properly loves her.

She's getting married in September to a wonderful guy though, so not everything is bad for her."

"I had 2 pet rats that passed away named Appa and Momo (from Avatar the Last Airbender).  I adored those little animals so much, and was heartbroken to lose them.

Avatar had a very short run with Lego.  Only 2 sets that have been discontinued for years and are hard to find. 

Well, he found them and built me a little shrine for their ashes."
A good buddy of mine(i'm a guy) is really into soil collection and other kind geological stuff and she volunteers with the park. She also looks like Evangeline Lilly.  Dudes are relentlessly going after her but I can't imagine how weird or dumb some of them think her soil thing would be if she looked different.  They eat it up just to impress her.  
"* The weird idea no one is romantically/sexually interested in women who are older than their early 20s. 

* That men who are not hot, tall, and rich will never be able to find happy, fulfilling, loving relationships.

These are just both so obviously and blatantly false in the real world that it makes me wonder what world the people advocating for these things as truth live in"

Two months traveling the world, a down payment on a house with a huge library/study, hell, put it in a ""badass concert tickets"" fund we can draw on. Anything but one stupid fucking piece of jewelry. "
"I think it was actually one of my last straws with him. At the time I didn't think too much of it but now that I look back it makes me furious. I had been working making $7.50 an hour and had saved up a few hundred over the last couple months. It was the first time I had be working for a while so I was proud of myself. Then I got pregnant and immediately knew I didn't want to keep it. He was fine with that. It cost like $800 to get done and had to be paid upfront. He said he had like 3 or 4 hundred he could contribute as he worked more and got paid several dollars more than me an hour. When it came down to the day I asked him for the money and he casually informed me he didn't have it anymore. Apparently beer and weed was more important.       
My health ended up going to shit sometime after that which ended up split us. It was a relief in the end. He was shitty and oppressing. Fuck that guy.

"I have a friend who fits this description, exactly.  When we suggest to her that she should have more realistic expectations, because her idea of the guy she wants doesn't really exist, she gets upset and says that we are telling her to settle.  We're not telling her to settle, we're telling her that no guy is perfect, and we do not come out to tell her that she herself has a list of flaws that most guys would probably find off putting.  She's 41 yrs old and just bitter, blaming everything on either men or women that she sees as the ones who get all the men, which unfortunately makes her even more unlikable.  Meanwhile, she hasn't really done anything in terms of self-growth to address some of her own glaring issues.  It's frustrating to see her struggle, but at the same time, she needs to change her own mindset, she has complained before that men can tell that she is desperate and I think that she is right, they probably CAN tell and it probably scares them.  If she does get married though, I will bend over backwards to be at her wedding.  I *hope* that she eventually finds someone."
"She's extremely immature, lets her parents and younger brother control every aspect of her life - including her mental illness, because she has schizophrenia but her parents don't want her to know, and so it's left treated badly. She has incredibly high standards and only goes after model-like guys who treat her like shit. She has a crush on her brother (no joke).

Most of it I'm sure is due to her illness, but since she's at her parents' mercy and doesn't even believe she has schizophrenia (parents made the doctor tell her she's bipolar), she can't do shit about it and it really makes me mad at her parents."

"We both married late and had only been married for three years. We had discussed what we would do beforehand but it was shattering to learn the fetus was a trisomy. That meant an abortion at almost 20 weeks due to testing, appointment delay, etc. He was unable to be there due to work so I did it alone. The staff there was wonderful. I told them how grateful I was for them taking on this work and they said no one had ever thanked them before!? I think my marriage would have been more at risk if I had not gotten the abortion. I could not have handled a disabled child, nor would I have felt good about forcing existing children to eventually have to take on that responsibility. I've seen that go very wrong for the abled children.

The second abortion was because the fetus died at 16 weeks. There is a deeply nasty Republican politician who, on video, likened women to cows and said that in the case of fetal death women could just carry it to term like cows did. My gynecologist refused to do an abortion, saying it would expel on it's own. I think I went a little insane for the two weeks it took to convince him otherwise. 

In spite of my difficult pregnancy history and two abortions we are still together. We were both on the same page and it helped a lot. No regrets for the abortions, just sad that the pregnancies did not work out."

"I actually do understand it, but it pisses me off: white being the default for attractive. In every Reddit thread about attractive people or attractive celebrities, the examples given are *always* white, with maybe one or two acceptable exceptions (e.g. Idris Elba) Subreddits about hot people are stuffed to the brim with generic white faces. It's *so* boring."

Oh my god. I'm so glad other people notice this. I've just stopped believing when people say this.

And finally after one month of doing things alone she realized, ""Why am I even in this?"" and she left you.

I have never heard a girlfriend describe a guy breaking up for no reason. I've only heard dudes do this."
Damn that's a beautiful woman on the inside as well then. I admit I probably wouldn't be able to look past this
"It wasn't really for me, and I don't think he knows I know, but I joined Reddit after stalking his comments and realizing that he's been referring to my daughters (his stepdaughters) as ""his kids"" since we moved in together, maybe a little before.

Anybody with a blended family knows how much anxiety and uncertainty comes with being the partner with the baggage and not being sure if the other person is ready to take on an instant family. Knowing that he saw them as ""ours"" and our family as ""his,"" and that he spoke about us that way even when I wasn't around to hear it, means more to me than anything."
"I've been the ugly friend.

Apparently my purpose in life was to be whined to about how terrible women are when over the course of two months some dude had voluntarily and proactively given her three coffees, one steak dinner and  six rides home. Not how terrible she is (which she isn't, she's only started to realise what that guy's game is upon reflection after that steak dinner, and is now weaning him off the endless giving by refusing more often than not) but how terrible women are. Which by definition includes the woman who hasn't gotten jack shit out of this deal other than to watch her friend eat free steak,  watch her friend drink free coffee,  wait at the bus stop alone without her friend to talk to, and now listen to whining from the guy who made it all possible."
"&gt;unwanted i.e. coming from a guy that they're not attracted to

i disagree - you can be sexually harassed by someone who you are attracted to. it's possible to find some attractive, and even sexually attractive, but not want sexual interactions with them in certain situations? eg. if I had a boss who I found attractive, but had no intention of ever acting on it, nor did I want to have sexual relations with him, then technically he could still sexually harass me. 

women aren't just sexual objects that are constantly ready and willing to have sexual interactions with every guy on the planet they find attractive, every second of the day. "

"Thank you. To answer your question-After the abortion, I had 3 surgeries on my spine that have since resolved the nerve-damage issue. I actually found out I was pregnant in the pre-op holding area for surgery #1. They refused to move forward with the surgery, as it would be a risk to the baby if I decided to keep it. I've now gotten clearance from my doctor(s) that I'm physically ready to carry whenever my husband and I decide the time is right."
"Not really for me, but still...

I was grocery shopping with our 2 young children one day. This random guy walks up and greets the 3 of us by name. He asked if we were feeling better since we had just been sick.

"Ex friend, because he is a stalker ""nice guy."" "

"My ex and I only got together because he had depression and needed a lot of help. I lived out my saviour complex, I had a lot of experience with taking care of depressed family members and literally pulled him out of his hole. We had a pretty good relationship after that, but after more than two years in, something happened in my life (nothing HUGE, but difficult for me, while I usually just shrug problems away) and I was very sad.

I still remember that afternoon. I was trying to tell him how sad I felt, it was the first time he ever saw me cry. He didn't hold me, he didn't do anything to make me feel better, he just stood up after a few minutes and said 

""You will get in therapy for this or I will break up with you, I cannot deal with this.""

and left, before he left he said ""You can contact me, when you have taken care of yourself.""

wtf. I was dumbfounded. I wasn't having a depressed episode or something, he had only seen me sad for minutes, I had taken care of him for months, made appointments with therapists for him, drove to him in the middle of the night, helped him out financially, took care of his life and needs when he couldn't and I just wanted a hug and comfort THIS ONE TIME, and he bailed? I was in shock. I think that was the moment I checked out of this relationship, even though we had an okay 6 months after that and split amicably.
I actually booked a few therapy lessons, in which my therapist told me that finding comfort in a relationship is very important and that asking for compassion from your partner in the way I did was completely okay. "
"i think that's the best part of ""me too"" - the point is just to say those two words that mean ""i have been harassed or assaulted in some way, i'm one of many on this spectrum."" some people are choosing to share details, but that's not what this is about. 

not to say you should participate if you aren't comfortable with it. but a simple ""me too"" could mean anything from rape to catcalling. the vagueness of it makes it easier for people to say it. "

I mean, I'm not even short and tbh a 5'10"" guy to me doesn't even seem much shorter than a 6'2"" guy...they're *both* a lot taller than me so wtf?  Why would this matter so much?  Why does it matter if a guy is 10 inches versus 15 inches taller than you?"
"I absolutely think any experience is ""enough."" Part of this broken system is that we make people feel like they have to hit some imaginary pain quota before they're allowed to ask for something to stop. It doesn't have to work like that."
They stayed with me even when I told them to go and that they didn’t deserve a girlfriend who was “crazy.” They devoted themselves to learning how to help me cope during the times when I felt like I could barely take care of myself.

"He wants to be. Honestly, I think he'd be a lot happier with a relationship; I think it would give him a sense of place and direction that's lacking in his life. 

But he's very... it's hard to explain. After going through two very painful breakups, he basically decided he never wants to do relationships ever again. He's sort of like that with everything. Once something hurts him he avoids it forever. 

Plus, he's sort of a unique person and very, very picky when it comes to actually *liking* people beyond just casual friendships. The only guy we know I think he would actually want to date and seems affectionate about, lives on the other side of the world. 

So, yeah, he'll be single forever."

"I feel like it's really bad on Reddit. Picture of something cool with a man, that's dope! Picture of something cool with a woman, she's just looking for attention, why's she even in the picture, would still smash. It's ridiculous. "
I thought I'd have my shit figured out. I thought every adult did. Instead I'm 31 and still making it up as I go along and it turns out so is pretty much everyone else. 
"The Office: Dwight, ugh, everything about him is hilarious to me.  
  
Parks: Jean Ralphio and Mona Lisa are hands down my favourite Pawnee residents and I would strangle them in real life.  
  
B99: Gina is the greatest, I adore her character. In real life she'd be rude and annoying.  
  
Arrested Development: Lucille and Buster are comedy gold together, but Lucille would be super unlikeable and Buster would be weird and offputting in real life."
And women's life expectancy as well as life satisfaction are both markedly decreased. 
"As a petite woman, I never felt it made me ""preferable"".  Most of the culturally ""iconic"" women are super long and lanky.  I really didn't have any idea that being petite was any bonus with men."
"OK, here’s a thought experiment for you. I want you to picture a guy. I have no idea what you look like, obviously, but this guy is built like a moving truck. He easily has 50 or 100 pounds on you, clearly works out every day, and you’d never catch a tan if you stood next to him on the beach. 

You don’t know this guy, but he saw you across the street/room/whatever, and he thinks you’re cute. How would you like him to go about interacting with you? 

Note that I’m going to leave aside entirely whether or not you’re attracted to men, because humans generally aren’t looking to get with every individual in the gender they’re attracted to. Realistically, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, all of our default assumption should be “this person doesn’t want to touch me.” I’m also going to leave aside the fact that you were probably not socialized to de-escalate risky interactions and protect aggressors’ feelings rather than confront them to the same extent most women are. Let’s just go with you being significantly smaller than the person interested in you, and pretty well guaranteed to lose in a fight. 

Would you want him to come over and start making sexual advances without ascertaining that you’re interested?

Would you want him to pay attention if your answers were monosyllabic and uncomfortable, and take the hint? Would you want him to read your body language that says, “holy shit, I really wish I’d stayed home tonight,” even if you weren’t ready to take the risk of turning him down verbally or turning your back and walking away? (He could be a perfectly reasonable person who takes rejection well, but you don’t know that. He could also flip out and break your teeth. Only one way to find out.)

Would you want him to check in with you before he touched you, verbally and nonverbally? Or would you rather he just went ahead?

If you wound up alone with him somewhere - maybe you were actually having fun talking to him, or maybe you just couldn’t figure out a way to make your excuses - would you want him to check in with you before and during any kind of escalation? Or would you want him to assume that you not leaving clearly meant that you wanted whatever he wanted?

If you were at work and he was a customer or your boss, how would you want him to approach and address you? If you were at the gym or pool and not wearing a whole lot, how would you want him to look at your body and express his appreciation, if at all? If you were out in a random space, how close would you want him to get without checking that you’re into it?"
"My husband cheated on me and I found out about it. It took me a while to gather the strength and courage to leave, and ultimately file for divorce. Now I have my own place and  a separate life and I can see past the grief .... and I have a BOYFRIEND. 

I cannot wait for the day the ex finds out.  It’s going to be a huge shock. "
"Mismatched libidos. The HL partner is always wondering why they're not good enough, what they're doing wrong, and the LL partner is always wondering why it's all about sex and why the love they do give isn't enough. When one person wants sex every day and the other only wants it once every month or two, there's really nothing you can do to make up for that. "
"Men who talk down on their SO make me cringe. If I hear that shit in public, it hurts me. Not sure if it's to stroke their ""superior"" ego, but it ultimately makes you look like a jackass. "
"It makes me sad to realize how many of my friends,  family, and acquaintances can say “me too”. "

"Spend an obnoxiously long amount of time on YouTube/mindlessly browsing the internet. Sometimes I try to do something that would be more ""fulfilling"", like playing a video game or watching a show but more often than not I just don't feel motivated enough :/ "
"My husband is VERY much taller than me (like, when I hug him, I'm hugging his belly), and while I obviously find him generally attractive, the height thing can kinda be a bummer. :( I can't just lean in for a kiss, can't look him in the eye evenly, dancing is a disaster..."
"As someone who is a devout Christian, I believe that there are a large amount of women who hold fast to that belief. I, on the other hand, believe that some men, despite reciprocating feelings, have a hard time asking someone out for various reasons. I actually pursued my boyfriend and made it obvious that I liked him. He did ask me out eventually. Most men won’t get subtle gestures or hints of any feelings so most of the time being obvious is the only way for them to get the picture."
"We weren't ready for it. We both agreed we didn't want to be parents. The abortion was emotionally draining on us both, but it also brought us closer."
"It's gone on far too long without any just desserts yet, I just can't be optimistic.  Last time he beat her and tried to blame it on the boyfriend, she was removed from my friend's custody and placed with a foster family during the investigation.  She was given back after a few months but there were no charges for the piece of shit and the custody arrangement is the same.  

Soon she'll be too old for him to lie about though so there's that at least."
"&gt;  I was ALWAYS his excuse when he just didn't feel like being social. Not cool.

I agree here. I do think there has to be a balance, because honoring your SO's schedule and preference is a good thing, and it can be done with courtesy instead of making them seem like a buzzkill. But, overall, I try not to micromanage my husband's outings, and appreciate when he doesn't blame me for not attending something, *especially* because I definitely encourage going out and doing things "
"I posted my story on twitter and had some very interesting results. Mostly I’ve had very supportive strangers being awesome, but I also had someone tell me I should just be grateful because I survived my experience and not everyone does.  This was after their original post that said “if your #MeToo story is the worst you’ve experienced, you should be happy. They deleted their comment before I could respond though. 

For reference, my #MeToo story was being repeatedly raped between the ages of 4-11 by a family member. 

For everyone who isn’t ready to, doesn’t want to, or doesn’t feel safe to share their story, please know you are still loved and cared about. You don’t owe anyone your story or your pain. 

Also, you anyone needs a safe person to talk to, I am always here for you."
"Disclaimer that this is ""just, like, my opinion, man,"" BUT

Use your common damn sense, and don't start from a 10/10 level of intensity when interacting with someone you like. Read social cues. If a woman is warm and enthusiastic, feel free to continue whatever you're doing. If she's not, leave her alone. 

There's no need to panic.
Just be a kind person and respect personal space in the way you'd want people to respect yours. Flirting is fun, and so is what sometimes results from it, but only if everyone involved is enjoying it. "
"Well, i have this relative. She's in her 50s, Catholic and I'm pretty sure still a virgin. So yeah, there is hope 🤣🤣"
"I was running late to work one day when I had a big presentation due and he casually asked me what I thought I was going to eat for lunch. He was reading the paper in the other room. I told him I was probably going to make myself a sandwich and snack on veggies or something. He's like ""I didn't know you liked sandwiches, what do you put in them?""

**Me**: Mayo, mustard, turkey, tomato, and swiss.

I finished putting myself together and went for my bag to start putting my presentation materials in. It was heavy. 

**Me**: What's this?  
**Him**: That's your lunch. It looked like you were running late so I packed a sandwich for you. I also cut up some veggies, and there's a little bag of trail mix in there if you want it. Also, since you won't have time to drink your coffee I put it in this thermos for you. Have a nice day swee--...sweetie, are you ok? 

**Me**: ^x *dead.*^x"
"Any woman they're attracted to is heterosexual, single, and willing to date them after twenty minutes of bland small talk.

"
"It's more of an awareness.

When women leave their houses or apartment each day, we all just seem to have a click of awareness that we're in public and men don't get it.

It's not that we're expecting or anticipating to be attacked but we live in a world and always have where a woman can be verbally or physically harrased, assaulted or worse.

So it kind of just builds into your psychological DNA.

It's subtle but it's there, every time we leave our place or a friend or family members place. Any public place we're in really."
"&gt; I, on the other hand, believe that some men, despite reciprocating feelings, have a hard time asking someone out for various reasons.

"I was a compulsive liar until my early 20s.  There are two real reasons.  One was that we were super poor, so when I was a kid I got used to lying so people didn't know.  So like I'd pretend that I'd been to the dentist or to a store to buy clothes.  And I also had a super abusive stepdad, so I'd lie to him to put him in a good mood so he wouldn't beat us.  

Anyway I just learned to tell stories to be interesting or to tell people what they wanted to hear.  

These weren't the super big crazy lies, like pretending I had cancer or anything, just lying about really common things - like, oh yeah, I've been to the state fair before, or yeah, of course I get my annual dental exam.  Just things where I felt someone would think something was wrong with me if I was truthful.  

Anyway, in my early 20s I realized it was completely unnecessary and worked hard to break the habit."

I, on the other hand, put a lot less time and effort into getting ready for the most part, which doesn't help my situation. I'd rather just meet a guy that likes me for what I look like normally so I'm sure I'm going to be single well into my 30s."

"I work in IT at a university. We had a secretary who tricked all the faculty in her department into believing that they couldn't use the 15,000 dollar copier in the department office, and that instead they had to print to either their office printers (if they had them) or to a tiny HP printer that was shared out. Now generally we install those smaller printers so that faculty have something to print to in case someone else is printing a big job on the copier and they need to get something printed quick. But she actually convinced them that they couldn't use the huge, expensive copier at all, and that only SHE could use it. 

She would also make it impossible to see the department chair, meaning any time a professor wanted to request a replacement computer (as the departments handle their computer/technology budget, we just set up and service what they get), she'd shut them down. Even if their computer was ten years old. The whole department was running on some of the worst equipment I've ever seen. But of course, she had the newest and best of everything. 

Eventually she did leave, but only because she retired. And it took WEEKS, but we finally managed to convince the faculty that they were allowed to use the resources given to them. A few months later, I had roughly 15 new computers to set up because they were finally able to request replacements. "
"Long distance relationship. I was a total mess one night after first moving into a new apartment in a new city, and was sobbing my eyes out. My boyfriend asks what he can do to help, and I jokingly said, “get me tissues,” because I didn’t have any to wipe my face on.

Two days later, a carton of tissue boxes arrives from Prime shipping at my office.

It’s four years later, we live together, and we’re finally finishing off the last box of tissues from that pack.

I read on my lunch break if the weathers crummy. And I’ll read a few chapters in the evening instead of watching television. I rarely watch tv, so I use that time for other things."
"When I was in community college I had to take a speech class with this super old Canadian professor who was very clearly suffering from cognitive decline, he often sturggled to teach the lesson and sometimes he'd go one weird speeches about being quiet in class. But he was generally very easy going and respectful. His wife was this old southern lady who was just as kind as him, and even though she wasn't a TA or a professor she'd pretty much teach 70% of the lessons every day. One day my group and I saw them walking to the parking garage holding hands and singing a little song in French "

I feel like more than anything it’s a meme that people are participating in because it’s in vogue right now. Personally I haven’t seen anyone in my feed who isn’t already comfortable speaking about feminist issues post anything about it. And I think it will be received by feminist guys well and anti feminist guys badly, I don’t really see this convincing anyone. 

Ice bucket challenge at least raised money for something and this COULD be doing that but instead it’s just dedicated to “raising awareness”. No offense to anyone participating but to me this feels like pointless wallowing And trend following.  I, personally, don’t see any practical value in it. 


And I hate that the current vibe right now makes me feel like I’m not allowed to have any critical opinion of any feminist branded thing because it makes me a bad woman or anti feminist. I’m all for women sharing their experiences, I’m just sick of people treating important issues as hashtags and trend fodder . "
They're called traps btw.
"I wax it off when it starts getting long enough to notice in the mirror (as long as I notice it on a Friday so my skin has the whole weekend to recover before work on Monday morning. 

I don't like my stache so I get rid of it. Plus, I work in a high school and, even though I shouldn't be, I'm still very worried about students making fun of me for various other reasons. If I can do away with one small reason, I feel better. 

If I liked my stache more on my own, I wouldn't wax it just for my students, though."
"But You Didn't

By Merrill Glass

Remember the time you lent me your car and I dented it?
I thought you'd kill me...
But you didn't.

Remember the time I forgot to tell you the dance was
formal, and you came in jeans?
I thought you'd hate me...
But you didn't.

Remember the times I'd flirt with
other boys just to make you jealous, and
you were?
I thought you'd drop me...
But you didn't.

There were plenty of things you did to put up with me,
to keep me happy, to love me, and there are
so many things I wanted to tell
you when you returned from
Vietnam...
But you didn't."
"I used to agree with the gym bodies thing. I was totally team dad bod for most of my life. I thought gym bros just tried too hard! Ugh, trying too hard was so unattractive to me. 

...and then I realized how many of my friends were prepping for some kind of bodybuilding/physique/bikini show. I always have had a flat butt, so I asked my buffest homegirl (with a beautiful big muscle butt) to take me to the gym with her to do legs and I absolutely fell in love with the gym. I feel so strong and powerful when I'm moving really heavy shit, and seeing progress is so really rewarding.

Shortly thereafter my formerly lean and buff, now dad bod boyfriend started working out too. He got shredded faster than I did, and I started to like how he looked more and more. He now has visible abs and he's proportionally jacked, not skipping leg day. Looks good at his 6' 240, probably around 12% body fat.

It took me a while to realize, that while I'm not fawning over the biggest meathead in the room all the time, in someone I was already attracted to, the change in his appearance didn't solely make him hotter. The change in his discipline and priorities did. We had more in common, we connected on a new level I hadn't ever experienced. I needed help with my diet, with my routine, with basically every aspect of training, and his attentiveness and patience explaining new things to me was so sweet. His confidence really changed too. He seemed more like his old self. 

Most of the guy friends I have who are into girls who work out agree that it's not necessarily the way a woman looks, it's more about your lifestyles, goals, and mentality being linked up, rather than just appearances. 

I see people who have gym bodies now and appreciate their hard work. I have serious leg envy when I see girls with big muscular legs and calves. Im in the gym maybe 5x a week, sometimes more during semester breaks. I have no life outside of work, so I fill my spare time with lifting weights and cardio. Now I've become someone who tries too hard too 😩"
"I just think some people perceive things differently. He's a really special guy; if he hadn't been already married when I met him and we lived in the same area, I can definitely imagine myself falling for him. (As it is, the friendship is very very platonic.) He's easily one of the top five people I have ever met in my entire life. "
"I had an abortion back when my SO and I had first gotten together. I was 21. He was 25. We had been together for about a month and a half. 

We were living in a tiny studio apartment and regularly having to choose what utility would get shut off that month so that we could cover the other ones and having to eat MREs he brought home from National Guard weekends. I had just gotten laid off from my job and didnt have a new one lined up yet. I was on the birth control patch at the time but kept having a reaction to the adhesive that, unbeknownst to me, decreased the effectiveness. 

When I started to suspect what was going on I was really scared to tell him. I didn't know how he might react. Also, my previous relationship had been with a really awful guy and once, when my old roommate joking told my ex I was pregnant because I was throwing up from the stomach flu, he immediately dropped into ""Well it sure isn't mine. Shes probably sleeping with tons of other guys anyways. She better not expect me to do anything for it."" So it is understandable that I had some anxiety. Luckily though, we were both on the same page about not wanting kids and in agreement about what we wanted to do and he was really supportive through the whole thing.  He went with me to all the appointments and took care of me because I was super sick for the entire short time I was pregnant.  

Ultimately I think it really strengthened our relationship to go through a stressful situation together and to really work at supporting each other during it. We have been together for 15 years now, married for 13 of them. Childfree and staying that way. Every once in awhile one of us will say ""Can you imagine what it would be like if we had a 14 year old kid right now????"" Neither of us regretted our decision for a moment and I'm grateful that if I had to go through such a difficult time, I did it with an amazing partner by my side."
"&gt;men, mostly lesser attractive ones, are afraid of being creepy.

Can't speak to my attractiveness but yeah, this is a huge factor."
He bit off my hang nail once because I was driving and needed it off immediately but was not trying to mess up my lipstick 
"If being ""being one of the guys"" means just another friend then yeah. I have a lot of friends that are men, and sometimes I'm the only woman there. In those contexts I like to be ""just one of the guys"" because obviously I just want to be treated like a friend and not singled out (whether positively or negatively) just because I'm a woman.

If being ""one of the guys"" means ignoring sexism, or actively participating in for example trash talking other women, or ignoring gross comments... Then no. Because again, I just want to be treated like any other friend, and I don't want to be friends with assholes, no matter what gender they are. "
"You aren't weird for what you say, you are weird for hor you look."
"Had a crush on an older guy (he was 18) when I was 14. Instead of talking to him or something normal, I made him an anonymous birthday card with a message composed in letters cut out of magazines, serial killer style. I can't remember exactly what was said, but I remember there being sexual innuendos and ""Who Am I?"" next to a very obvious clue (an image of something I share a name with). I got a friend to (reluctantly) hand him the card. I still wonder if he kept it or if he threw it out lol. "
"The large prevalence of guys who seem to think that women only consider it harassment if it comes from someone they find unattractive is always troubling. Unwanted does NOT just mean ""attention from an ugly guy"". If I'm walking home at night and someone makes a sexual comment towards me, I don't care how hot he is, I'm not gonna like it. If I'm trying to work and a customer comes on to me, I don't care how hot he is, I'm not gonna like it. If I'm out at a bar and some guy continues to hit on me even after I told him I'm unavailable, I don't care how hot he is, I'm not gonna like it. "

&gt;Do not stand at my grave and weep

"I agree, I don't often feel consciously scared or uncomfortable, but I also do a lot of things automatically that doesn't really occur to a lot of my guy friends.  
  
I think a lot of it has to do with previous experience - some of my guy friends who have encountered trouble before have the same sort of situational awareness, but not most of them. Contrasting to my female friends, where most have had many unsettling and/or actually dangerous encounters, so most of them do those things automatically. "

All I heard from adults was how miserable they were, how many responsibilities they had, how much work it was etc. and how much they missed being a kid.

Pft. Yeah adulthood has more responsibilities but I have waaay more freedom now."
"I never thought I would agree with this, but the other day my friend showed up and blasted me with a beam of the whitest white imaginable. It was very distracting. I was too preoccupied with the whiteness to even listen to what he had to say."

I check my back seat before I get into my car, I keep my phone in my hand at all times and make sure it's always charged, I lock my doors as soon as I get into my car, I don't let anyone walk behind me, and so on and so forth.

It isn't just that I'm afraid of being a victim again, it's also that I'm afraid of being back into the court of public opinion, and being blamed for my own attack again.  It's that feeling of powerlessness that permeates every facet of my life.  I'll be blamed if I attack my attacker, I'll be blamed for being a victim, I'll be blamed for not fighting back, I'll be blamed for being traumatized, I'll be blamed for joking about my own attack, and so on and so forth.

"Not mine but my husband's friend.

He firmly believes that if the butterflies in the stomach go away it isn't real love and not something to build a relationship on.

Unfortunately, I didn't have a quarter in my pockets so the kid's mother just let them hurt me for a little while before telling me to go fetch my coin pouch. 

I don't think I'm ever going to be pinned down over 25 cents again, but enough people get beat over debts that I think the fears are not completely unjustified. "
I’m not attractive and don’t like myself. Hard to find someone who thinks I’m a catch.
I collect insects. And most people think I am a creep for it but I remember seeing a YouTuber who collected insects (displayed poorly and were bought online) being called an inspiration to girls and how awesome it was. Last time I went collecting at a local park a mom steered her kids away in disgust.

My dad immediately called me to check if I was ok. A sweet thought but really not necessary haha.
"&gt;The idea that women don't actually genuinely like literally anything, including people  

Somehow I'd never put this into one consolidated idea before.  I know women aren't supposed to really like other women (we're all just frienemies!), and we're not supposed to like men (we're using them for babies or money or to do shit for us!), and we don't really like makeup or fashion (we do those things to attract men for babies and money and to do shit for us!), and we don't really like other hobbies (we just pretend to so we can get attention from the menz!).  

And yet somehow I'd never pulled that together.  There really isn't anything that the manosphere thinks women genuinely like except I guess spending money?"
"Yes! It's infuriating. There is no reason you can look at a dirty countertop or a sink full of dishes and not put two and two together that you should take care of them. We want an equal partner, not a child we have to tell to do basic household tasks. "
"I pull it down. I generally don't find it to be a big deal to do so.

Some women pull the shorts to the side, but I'm afraid I'd pee on myself"

"My father is an asshole...let's call him Kevin. Kevin is a compulsive liar and a narcissist. He literally makes everyone around him groan from his assholery, including my family. We eventually got sick of it, so we started a game called ""Kevin's timeline"" and every time he tells us a fake and extravagant story about his life, my sister, brother and I text eachother. We string together his insanely false life stories and it is quite amusing. So whenever we are together and he rants about his ""crazy high school days"" or ""the rabid hobo he met in San Fran"" we just look at each other and grin. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. "

"As others have said, common sense goes a long way here. There is a major difference between sexual assault and sexual harassment, also. 

&gt; Similarly, if you go down the list of ""Sexual harassment includes many things..."", in the PDF linked above, and remove the words like ""Unwanted"" or ""rape"" from the list, a lot of it is just a list of sexual things that some men and women may do together, in private.

Not to be rude, but no shit. Consent is literally the entire difference between sex and sexual assault, so yeah - unwanted touching is assault. 

&gt; The biggest difference being that they're unwanted i.e. coming from a guy that they're not attracted to.

This honestly reeks of RedPill/incel mindset. Even if a person I am attracted to grabs me without my consent it is sexual assault. Even if my boyfriend grabs me without my consent it is assault. This idea that the only thing different between creepy and wanted attention is how good looking the guy is just absolute nonsense.

Essentially, don't walk up to a girl you don't know and try to have sex with her. Pay attention to body language when you are talking to a girl you're interested in. It isn't as if people just spontaneously appear naked in bed together and you have to figure out in two seconds if you're allowed to fuck or not - generally people talk and get to know one another a little before having sex. "
Resentment.
"I'm just under 5'3"" and my husband is 6'2"". He's the tallest person I've ever dated. It really is a pain and the worst part is that he uses that height to hide my gifts in plain sight. Plain sight on the top shelf, that is."
"I keep a private Amazon wish list for gift ideas and it's primarily my SO's family.  Just throughout the year when I see something fun or interesting, I'll add it with a note on who it's for.  

So the other day I told my SO that I wanted him to sit and look at the list to give me his input and I specifically said that I know it's early to think about Christmas gifts, but I want to make sure we're budgeted.  

And dude rolled his eyes at me and gave this long suffering sigh.  Like, seriously?  

He did apologize when I pointed out that I was doing *him* a favor but it's just like, why did I need to remind him in the first place?"
"My fights usually start like this:

Him: why are you mad?
Me: I’m not saying anything or you’ll be mad.
Him: I won’t be mad I promise.
Me: well I hate that you always make jokes about (insert insecurity, inside joke you just hate, or whatever the issue is)
Him: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I’M JUST JOKING RELAX. YOU USED TO GET MY SENSE OF HUMOR BUT NOW YOU’RE ALWAYS MAD AT ME!!!
Me: so you’re mad now right?

Don’t do this. Don’t ask her to tell you what’s wrong only to have you blow up in her face. This will only make her start answering “What’s wrong?” with “Nothing.”"
"I've noticed a trend about men who  say they want funny and/or intelligent women: they actually want women who make *them* feel funny and intelligent. They want a woman who is intelligent and funny enough to listen to their lectures and laugh at their jokes, but not a woman who is *more* intelligent or funny than they are. 

Dudes who actually appreciate intelligent and funny women don't go around loudly proclaiming it over and over again. "
Only pay attention to a problem when it inconveniences him.
"I eat dessert, brush my teeth, do my skincare and then lately I've been reading and/or writing before bed. I used to watch Netflix though until I found out that's it's really not good to look at screens before bed😅"
"Honestly I think I'd at some point abandon Rory Gilmore if we were friends irl. She's so intelligent but doesn't know how to put it to good use and her decisions with men are atrocious.

At the same time, the show is literally her mid-teens to young 20's so I feel like if I started with her, and ended the show with her - I'd have stuck by her. But as a mid-twenties adult I feel like I watch the show internally screaming ""YOU CAN BE BETTER!!!"""

"That everything about a woman can be explained by the fact that she *is* a woman. That there are universal truths and explanation that will decode any woman's behavior, emotional state, or preferences. "
"Definitely Assertiveness like u/wobblebase said.

I would also say Humor.  There’s a perception women aren’t funny and funny women are annoying and/or not ladylike."

"As someone that wants everyone to feel comfortable,  take the tea/coffee if you want it. It makes people like me feel like we're making a (small) difference. ❤"
"Especially towards the same sex. When a man doesn't like another man and says so, it's because men are honest and don't do drama. When a woman does it, it's because women are catty and such drama."
"When a man asserts his boundaries, he is respected. If a woman tries to assert her boundaries she is an uptight bitch. "
Looking out for yourself is wise and having your priorities straight if you're a man. The same actions are often interpreted as selfish or ungrateful if you're a woman. 
I hope more men start taking womens stories about sexual harassment seriously. 
"🙈 Life is good. I used to feel bad about being introverted, preferring to be alone, wanting to stay in. I grew up and learned to embrace it. I'm happy!"
"Haven’t had anything like this happen to me or anything, but damn.. your comment choked me up, it’s amazing to hear that a couple can get past something like this, in a healthy way. I really admire that! Congratulations on getting married, and I wish you all the luck in the world. "
"I have 2 friends and probably myself that probably will be single forever. 

Friend 1 is extremely picky. Nothing wrong with that, but it's VERY hard to find an attractive guy that is devoutly religious, a virgin, and older than 21. She also never asks out guys first, expects guys to do it first, and has a ton of expectations such as being a SAHM and living on the beach. She is in a lot of debt due to bouncing between colleges and she finally seems to be sticking to something. She has never had a boyfriend.

Friend 2 has a pretty good chance of getting married but she has some commitment issues. She second guesses everything, has extreme anxiety, and is also in a lot of debt due to bouncing around colleges. I am not sure if she figured it out yet. She also will not ask guys out first.

I will probably be single forever because I don't make time for dating and I'm really afraid of getting cheated on again (long story.) 
"
"I wonder if your friend ever does this as an intentional step in her relationship. And I don't mean that *quite* as cold-hearted as it sounds. Basically, you guys are obviously **good** friends and will continue to be good friends in the future. So at some point in her relationship with other people that other person is going to meet you. She knows you are attractive, obviously, so no matter how attractive she is, at some point she will be the 'familiar' to these guys and you will be the 'new and hot' person. So she must have to decide at what point to introduce you to him. And I, out of selfish, morbid curiousity, have to wonder how much of those plans involve being aware that afterwards her relationship may change. And how much she plans around paying attention to see how he reacts to you, and how he will treat her after meeting you. You just may well have unintentionally saved her from many a terrible relationship, in a different way than most of us have saved our friends from terrible relationships. When we can."

"Been around a little bit more I guess, he worked a lot and while we sometimes did things as a family I never really did anything just with my dad.

"
That they just have to be ""nice"" to whichever woman they're attracted to, regardless of her interest in him, then if she is a decent human being she must of course reciprocate his feelings 100% otherwise she's a shallow bitch who's only into Chads. "
"She doesn't want a partner. 

A part of me wondered if she would change her mind but she's felt this way since about 15 and now she's in her early 30s and still feels the same way."
He told me the other day he starts setting his alarms at 4am and calls them “snuggle alarms” so he can come cuddle me for two hours before we have to get up 
"Put women on a pedestal.

I get really uncomfortable when guys start telling me how perfect I am and how invested they are in me early on. Like no, I'm a person, too. I have personal flaws as well and it's not sunshine and rainbows all the time.

It just makes me think they're viewing me more as a trophy instead of an actual person."
Just saying thanks because this thread is giving me hope. I’m fairly new to Reddit and sometimes I’m just like ....what is this. Is this what people are really like? Then I have some real-world interaction and it brings me back to reality.

"All the upvotes for this. My mother has five straight sisters and at holidays all their husbands get together to complain about them, often in front of their children. On my wedding day, several uncles and a cousin's husband approached my husband to ""welcome him to the club"". Made us both feel icky."
"My father died on Friday night. On the Saturday, I was at home distraught and sad, with nothing ""to do"" because we weren't going to meet with the funeral people until Sunday. As I was trying to deal with my grief, my boyfriend whined about being bored, bugged me to go out and do stuff, then eventually left to go to the park and read a book or something. My father died less than 24 hours before and all I got from him that day was negativity. I always felt it was the beginning of the end, we broke up about 4 months later. We'd been together 7 years."
The other ones had pee on the seat or someone didn't flush.
"In college. She was super morbidly obese and didn't wash herself properly.  She literally had mold growing in her fat folds. She smelled so bad. And it made the whole room stink. She blamed it on my clothes that smelled like chlorine because I was a swimmer. I tried to spend as much time out of my room as possible. I was still nice to her when I saw her.  But then she ate all my food and told me she didn't know where it went, when I hadn't been there for a few days. I called her out on it because I saw a poptart wrapper sticking out from her desk. I left again for a few days. When I came back I saw she pooped on my bed four times. She sat in that room for how many days with shit on the bed. I told my RA and there was a hearing with the building director and she tried to say everything she did to me was stuff I DID TO HER!! I shut her down right there and told that dorm director he was more then welcome to see the four piles of shit on MY bed. Last I knew she was kicked out of school for endangering the health of another student. I didn't even know that was a thing. "
"All the hair all these other women don't have, is on my butt. "
"She had such horrible self esteem she's only attracted to men who treat her as horribly as she feels about herself. If you think you are worthless and not worth spending time with, you only are attracted to men who hump and dump you. She also not interested in working on her self esteem issues, she thinks a relationship will fix her. And she will get pissed if you are honest about it. 

She does it to herself. It's sad but she is doing the opposite of what she needs to do to fix it. "
"My favorite is ""I would rather date a nice intelligent 7 than a bitchy 9"" as if the guy, who's a 3, has either of those options."
same. i'm convinced it's mostly dudes telling other dudes they look good bulging and veiny.
"She didn't pay rent/bills on time. 

Didn't clean. 

Her room was full of super gross old dishes (my dishes that we would run out of cause they were full of curdled milk in her room).

She was bipolar. 

After a summer of mowing the grass every time (with a push mower), I informed her that it was now her turn. The grass got super long and one day I come home to find her grabbing giant handfuls of grass and cutting it with a steak knife. 

Later when I asked why- she said she couldn't afford two dollars worth of gas for the mower. (And didn't think to ask if I would buy it?)

She was probably the worst. A few horrendously messy/alcoholic roommates get honorable mentions. "
"One of my friends from high school is just simple. She's simple and it's not her fault but I cannot handle being around her because she just constantly says the dumbest stuff. She doesn't realize it's dumb and ends up accidentally saying really condescending stuff all the time.

Most memorably she had a facebook meltdown because she couldn't afford floor seats at a Coldplay concert. Said she hates America because of it. Other times she requests prayers for her sunburn or so she can find her sweater.

She hasn't noticed I've been trying to avoid her for four years and she's still trying to get me to hang out."
Biggest pro for being in a relationship is the increased lifespan. Men who are in a good committed relationship have statistically lived longer than singles.
"&gt; a simple ""me too"" could mean anything from rape to catcalling. the vagueness of it makes it easier for people to say it.

that's been tripping me up here... I've been doing that dance of measuring my own experiences and going ""was it that bad? do I need to worry that much about this as counting? should i say it? does it count if i know women who XYZ was way worse and happened...?"""
"My experience: I posted about how where I used to live, I was catcalled and harassed every day. The only comment I got was from a girl who said she'd never experienced anything like that when she lived there. Then she messaged me and apologised for posting that, deleted her comment, and sent me another message telling me ""not to generalise""

"Once, a bunch of people from my derby team and I were out together, and one person was like ""OMG we should go to the strip club and try to recruit the strippers to join our team.  They're athletic I bet they'd be really into it.""

I think everybody was like ""Oh yeah haha that's such a great idea"" and no one really wanted to go, but also no one wanted to be the stick in the mud who stopped everybody else from going, so we all went to the strip club.

Once we got in, everybody was like ""Oh my god I am so embarrassed I don't know what to do let's just sit in this corner and drink overpriced drinks this is so stressful.""  Whenever a stripper came over to our area, my wife and I were the ones to make conversation because, I don't know, designated lesbians.  We chatted about life and sports and she liked my unicorn jacket and no we didn't want a lap dance, but you're really great, just you know, general validating girl talk.  

So when she goes up to dance, everybody wants to make sure that she is well compensated for her time, and she feels appreciated, and she honestly was a wicked awesome dancer, and just busting out these sick pole stunts while everybody else is just kinda slowly shaking around.  But we don't know the proper etiquette for things like this, and none of the straight girls wanted to come in contact with her at all, so they're all just giving me these dollar bills like ""give them to her I can't do it"", and I don't want to put them in her gstring or have her shake her vagina in my face.  I'm yelling ""WOO HOO!"" like a mother at a dance recital.  Then, when her back is turned, I run up there, throw *handfulls* of cash in her general direction, then run back to my friends to hide.

She picked up the money and laughed at us and we made heart symbols with our hands and told her how great she was, and then we gave a couple self-identified dirty old men flyers with our bout dates on them and we just GTFOed."
"My first was pretty terrible. I labored for approx 36 hours, no epidural. I finally got an IV pain medication, and it STOPPED my labor. They let me sleep for an hour before administering pictocin. Pictocin took me from 4cm 70% effaced to fully dilated in under 5 minutes. My contractions were so strong I ""popped"" open and required 7 stitches in different locations around my vagina. 

My second, man she was a breeze. Labored for 7 hours. Waited too long to head to the hospital (I wanted my damn cheeseburger!) Ended up delivering in triage with 2 pushes. No epidural, no pain meds, no ""popping"". 

As for the actual pain, I put it in 2 categories. 

Cat 1 is actual labor contractions. These start at a mild 1 one the pain scale, and slowly (or not) move up to a 20. 

Cat 2 is actually delivering the baby. It's not so much pain as intense pressure. With my first, I literally thought that I couldn't do it. It felt like I was going to explode. 

Labor and delivery is the most intense physical pain a human can endure and survive. But literally the second that baby is out of you, you forget all about it. "

"So true.  I had an ex insist that I join his band even though I had no interest in it.  He actually told me that I must not love him and sulked for weeks because I didn't want to, but would rather watch.  He also wanted me to play video games with him (which I do enjoy) but got upset when I played his God of War game too much.  Then he let his friends actually berate me for sucking at games I had never played before and therefore lost.  Usually followed by comments about how I was a girl.  I had to defend myself while he just sat there and let them argue with me.
Of course, I liked drawing and horse back riding, we went riding once and he claimed it was too expensive and argued with me when I refused to give it up.  (Like paying for his band crap wasn't expensive?  Also.. I paid all my bills and our finances weren't connected!)  He also never tried anything artistic, but I guess I was allowed that hobby since it was cheap.
My current SO doesn't have a single artistic streak in his body but whenever we travel he makes a point to look up the art museums and take me. He actually engages and we discuss the art and end up having a good time.  I really appreciate his interest in my hobbies and it makes me feel loved.  I love getting to know some of the things he does, especially things I wouldn't normally be interested in, and it's nice to have that returned."

"It was very frustrating when I found out. I absolutely love my space and alone time so if my partner wants to go out somewhere, I'd never try to stop him and if anything I encourage it every single time. 

I was angry when he admitted that when he doesn't want to go out somewhere, he just tells them it's because of me because ""it's just easier."" Half because it's a lie and I really, really loathe liars but the other half is because of instances like what happened w/ his brother. His brother thought I was stopping him from going out and having a good time and I don't really want my partner's family to think such things about me."
That kid's mother sounds like a monster. What the hell was her damage?!

"I've been with my SO for 12 years and in that time had two abortions. 

The first came 6 years ago. We were one month away from graduating college. When we graduated, he was going to move 150 miles west for graduate school and I was moving 600 miles south. We were planning on staying together after school. We found out I was pregnant and immediately knew that a child was not about to ruin our futures. I had the abortion two days after receiving my diploma. At first it hurt our relationship because we were 1000 miles apart when it happened. I felt abandoned and like he didn't take enough time to comfort me. We've discussed it and he was afraid of overwhelming me and making me feel guilty. I still remember how I felt about him during that time, but I understand his perspective. 

The second abortion came just over 3 years ago. At this point we were pretty certain we were going to be child free for life. As soon as we found out i was pregnant, it became a matter of planning the procedure. We both knew that children were not in our plans. He came with me to both the doctors appointment and the actual procedure. He held my hand the entire time and I remember squeezing his hand as the doctor cut inside of me. On the drive home, he made jokes so I would smile. He tucked me into bed, bought me pads, and listened to me complain about blood clots. It was never an issue, just a speed bump in our life together."

"I've literally had to beat guys off my friend with sticks at the club. I finally had to physically push some guy out of the way who had inserted himself between us for the third time when we were facing each other with 12 inches between us and tell him to gtfoh. He looked at me all incredulously asked me if I was her body guard ""or something"" and I yelled NO, YOURE JUST REFUSING TO READING HER BODY LANGUAGE THAT CLEARLY STATES SHES NOT FUCKING INTERESTED. he left us alone after that 

However I've since had to drop that friend. I hated going out with her because we couldn't actually enjoy our time together with all the attention she gets, but in hindsight I now see that's exactly why she wanted to go out *all the time*. Dress and act super provocatively in the club, and then ignore the male attention because she's actually a lesbian, act aloof but never directly shut them down in any way as they continue to linger and buzz around her all night leaving me, the less attractive one to be the one to finally swat them away. Like some huge validation that's she's very attractive circle  jerk. Big ass weave, long expensive nails, tons of expensive makeup and clothes, going out to the club every weekend, while her baby daddy has full custody in another state she never visits, all while not contributing to the child's life in any way because she ""has no money.""

"I worked with a woman who was 74 years old. She slept at her desk, sabotaged projects (and admitted it), was rude to other staff, would take personal calls at work - and would tell customers to wait while she finished a personal call, slammed doors/drawers/etc when she was angry, would close up the office so she could walk to the other building and get a snack, and I could go ON and ON. But everytime her supervisor addressed her performance she would drop the age card, which made the company reluctant to discipline her or let her go because they were afraid of an age discrimination lawsuit. I worked with her for 5 years (and I lasted the longest - my predecessor and two replacements after me have quit much sooner). She is still there (and pushing 80 now). "

My mother got super depressed and depended on me to talk to all the time and reassure her; then I got involved with a partner for five years who had severe mental health problems, and I burnt out. I'm trying to get better, because come on it's been three years since my mom got better and my ex and I split; I can't use it as an excuse forever. But to this day when someone starts voicing helpless depression to me, I automatically tense up and if I'm already stressed for whatever reason I can feel panic starting. "

"I am an Administrative Assistant. I was hired in 2004 because I needed a job and they offered me a decent wage after temping with them briefly. Turns out I am pretty good at the work and being ADHD, I thrived in the structured environment. I have been with the company for over 13 years, with my current department for 9 years. (I switched departments to work on the office closer to my home)

I thrive with daily routine. I enjoy having a job that I can leave at work when I go home. I won't ever be rich and it is not glamorous or challenging work, but I own a house and make enough to live comfortably now through various raises and an hour increase. I am not particularly career oriented. I just want to make a living, and it does the trick.

Unfortunately my type of job is becoming harder to come by. The downside is I have been here long enough that if I left, no one would be willing to pay me what they pay. I really have no desire to leave though. Like I said, I thrive with structure and routine."

"His husband is exhausting.  Utterly exhausting.  He can never go along with a group and always has to have things his way.

Stupid example: We went to a park about a 15 minute drive from the nearest town for a hike.  He wants a Coke.  We go to the park gift shop and they have a Pepsi cooler.  He throws a fit and says we need to get Coke.  Our friend his husband is like... well guess we have to get back in the car and go to town to get that.

So we all just stopped inviting him because we can't stand his husband.  Various people have talked to him about it, but nothing changes, so we just lose interest in inviting them to stuff (since ""you can't bring your SO but everyone else can"" isn't really polite)."

My SO would turn into a big silent tantrum when he was upset. If I asked him if something was wrong, he would blow up at me for asking. If I didn't ask, he would just stay quiet mad for days. 

It was seriously the biggest relief in our relationship when he figured out he could be mad and then use that energy to figure out how to voice his grievance after cooling off. 10/10 would recommend!"
"I'm tired of men not believing women. Literally every woman I know has been *at least* sexually harassed, if not assaulted or raped. Most more than once.

Are we going to do this every time a new accusation comes out? It's emotionally exhausting.

I'd been avoiding much of this case, and then yesterday I read a lot of the original story and it just brought a lot of things back. "
"I had trust issues because I had been in an abusive relationship before and was trying not to fall into it. I was upfront about that when we met, and I made clear boundaries about what I expected from him. 

I finally accepted him when he proved himself and his worth via his words and his behavior. I saw him:  

- *really* listen to me  
- respect my boundaries in terms of the rate of growth in a relationship (we got together when I was ready, not when he convinced me to be ready)  
- respect my boundaries in terms of sex (no means no) and never tried to guilt or convince me to have sex if i wasn't feeling it that day  
- be emotionally vulnerable with me   
- be upfront about what he wanted from me and our relationship, and encouraged me to do the same  
- took constructive criticism with humility and good will   
- expressed constructive criticism the same way  
- speak kindly about the people around him (i especially paid attention to how he spoke about other women)  
- manage his negative emotions in productive and unthreatening ways: crying when he needs to cry, using his words when he needs to, but never resorting to insults or violence or freezing me out  
- never let me down  
- practice the art of a meaningful apology  
- treat himself with kindness and respect

"I didn't know applicatiors were a mainly US thing. the reason I don't use tampons without applicatiors isn't because I don't want to touch blood, but I literally can't get them in all the way. I've tried many times because they're a lot cheaper but I just can't do it 😩😵"
Probably not with a drink to the face. Oops.
"I think he expected it to go something like this:

""plain girls get jealous around hotties, so why do you have so many friends?""

""Oh we're just hanging out together, but I don't need to stay with them.""

""Why don't you ditch them and come back to my place for irresponsible sex after which I'll never talk to you again unless I keep your number to hit you up for more irresponsible sex whenever I want.""

""Sounds good, lets go.""

Ok yeah that was written in a judgemental way I don't really mean, because if you want to participate then go ahead (just don't ignore the 'irresponsible' part, take care of yourself). Other than that I do think he expected her to make a comment about the friends not being as important as hooking up with a guy."
"It's behavior like this that make me resent the stupid but well-intentioned ""everyone is beautiful! you are beautiful!"" messages to boost self-esteem.

You notice how people treat you versus others, over and over. Bashing people over the head with feel-good messages does zero to erase what real life tells you."
I'm not a fan of huge beards. I like scruff. 
Came here for this one. All the skin damage and possibility of melanoma which has been scientifically proven. It's a cultural thing too; East Asians are all about staying untanned.
"I call them ""Cardassian muscles."""
"That you would just be able to do whatever you want.

I mean, you can, to some extent, but not really. A lot of stuff you either don't have time for or can't afford, and other stuff you can't do because you have bills to pay, pets at home, a house to clean, whatever.

Like, nobody's going to make you clean your house, but then you have to live in a filthy house."
"Definitely not my dumbest, but just this morning, on the way to work I forgot to get in the far right lane to get on the freeway and felt too weird to try to get over (like a normal person would've).  So I pretended I meant to go straight into a neighborhood the entire time. And then waited 15 seconds and turned around and got on the freeway.  (Like anyone knew or cared that I was supposed to be in the right lane!!)"
[removed]
I wonder how he expected that to go...
"I like how mine look in this bra but if a wizard showed up and offered me some Bs I'd jump on that shit real fast. It's not worth the attention (not even just sexual, people just think it's ok to stare and comment on them) or the pain or the expensive bras. "
"Hairlessness... on both men and women. If you want to remove body hair that's totally fine, but I don't understand how it has just become the expectation. "
"That they prefer women who are intelligent or have a ”nice personality” but in the end it’s all about looks. I have a male friend who used to go around and say how much he appreciates brain and funny women but he ALWAYS chooses to date women who don’t exactly fit that category.

I’ve also noticed that men are really intimidated by women into STEM/programming/doctor/lawyer sort of careers. Especially if you’re in these sort of fields and you’re not conventionally attractive. Most men would never date you.

But in the end, it’s all about looks. You need to be pretty, that’s all what matters."

"I was 18. He really wanted to keep the baby, he had actually pulled out my IUD on purpose even though I didn't want him to. I said no and got the abortion. No regrets tbh. On top on him pulling out my IUD he also gave me an STD. I ended up finding out he was married and just cheating on his wife with me. And we ultimately broke up. Honestly I don't regret the abortion at all. It was the best thing I could have done for my life."
yes. I think a lot of attractive people would be blind to the bad/different treatments their less attractive friends get when they're getting all the benefits and all the fawning. 
"My fiance intended to propose to me at Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany and had the ring box in his pocket but changed his mind  because there were so many tourists around and wanted to wait until we were more alone to do it. Well, I apparently accidentally bumped into him and basically grabbed onto the box without even knowing it. He told me this after he ultimately proposed to me (on NYE in Reykjavik) and he had worried for those 2 weeks that I knew he had the ring. I did not in fact because he had told me it never came in the mail and we were still waiting for it. It was adorable.  "
"Lack of respect... I didn't realize it as it was happening, but in hindsight my ex often made me feel like my job wasn't as important as it was (I am a VP at my company, which is something I worked hard to attain), his friends and plans took priority often, and forget about sharing something as small as watching a video I wanted to show him or listening to a song all the way through that I wanted to play him.

It was subtle but it ground on me and ultimately caused me to fall out of love. When it all came to the surface, it just felt like it was too late and I didn't even want to work on it which broke my heart to tell him since I still cared about him as a person and a friend after nearly three years together.

Speak up for yourselves, ladies..."
Want to hear some great news? We never have to be teenagers again. Isn't that a relief? 😊
Oh my god. You've already done most of the work and all you're asking for is a little more input for financial preparation. I'm so frustrated on your behalf. 
"Ugh. I HATE THIS. I just got married and fortunately my husband (omg) and his friends don't subscribe to that bullshit. It's infuriating to me and insulting to him. Like, he's a perfectly intelligent adult capable of making his own conscious decision to enter into a legal equal partnership with me.  "
"Okay, this one physically hurt to read."
"I was in a long distance relationship. He came over to visit during Valentine's Day. It would be our first Valentine's Day together so I was excited and planned a 4-course meal. Come that day, I only needed to spend an hour putting everything together and cooking it because I had prepped a lot the day before. So the earlier half of the day could be spent doing fun stuff in each other's company. 

My ex was a weeaboo. Like, I enjoy anime/manga and used to partake in conversations but he got me beat in that department. He came all the way here and pretty much just laid in my room, wasn't being affectionate, and he wanted to do a [dinner with waifu pic](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/dinner-with-waifu-otaku-dates) with *my pretty awesome desktop setup* so he could share it with his anime club's Vday Waifu Collage. He asked if I could get his waifu's favorite food...

Gotta love your partner and their interests right? So I did it. I went and grabbed whatever he wanted and picked up extra stuff for our dinner. He didn't pay me back. I essentially paid for a nonfictional character's dinner that was never eaten. I just felt like he had always put his club's interests before me and this was one of those moments. I guess I felt taken advantage or and unappreciated because around 4PM I just broke down and told him to leave.

He came back later, knocking on my door. I answered it and he started crying. He told me (wait for it)... he told me tried to steal roses but the lady at the stand caught him so he dropped it and ran, so he was sorry he couldn't get me roses. WHAT THE FUCK. But the most disappointing thing is that I let him back in, eat my 4-course meal, and stayed with him for another year. The cool thing is that I posted the pictures of my dinner on /r/food and got close to the front page. Woo...."
"Lol, thats how you know you got a good friend =)"
"Well, thanks to r/skincareaddiction I spend a quick 4 hours in the bathroom cleansing, exfoliating, masking, anti-aging, serumming, azeliec acidding, charcoaling sponging, eye creaming and moisturising. 

After which I fall asleep in an exhausted heap next to my husband while he mentions how nice it is to actually see me somewhere other than in the bathroom."
"It's a bigger thing, but literally two weeks after we started dating I had sinus surgery. I expected him to visit but coming from an abusive relationship I didn't really know what was a fair expectation beyond that.

He took care of me for the whole 7 days after, watched copious amounts of netflix with me, fed me, made sure I took my pain meds/antibiotics, cuddled me whenever I asked for it. Essentially babied the hell out of me. 

I had fuckin spacers that looked like straws up my nose and every morning when he woke up beside me he'd say ""Good Morning, Beautiful.""
It means so much to me (self esteems issues) I was just baffled and have cried more than once about it lol. "
"Exactly. 
""What can I clean?""
""I dunno how about you open your eyes look around?""

"I’ve always been lacking when it comes to bedtime rituals. Lately I’ve been making a serious effort. Here’s some rules I gave myself. 

No drinking on work nights. Drinking fucks op REM sleep. 
No phone in the bed. I can set the alarm, but nothing else.  No ‘let’s check one round of tweets’ or ‘let’s have a quick look at the news’. Nothing. Because I always end up spendings a long time on my phone and *whoops* I should have been sleeping already. 
I used to only shower in the mornings, but now I also shower before bed. I take my time, take good care of myself, have a nice shower gel, clean bathroom, stuff like that. I want to feel like I get out of the spa, so a bit rose cheeked and tired. 
After my shower a cup of green or white tea.
When I go to bed, I can only sleep when i’m on my stomach. But purposely I lie on my back for about half an hour so that I don’t sleep, but doze off a little. In the end I turn around naturally and fall asleep very fast. 
I try to sleep around 22.00-22.30. Used to be 00.00-00.30 and I got up at 8.00 and had to rush to leave at 8.30. Now I wake up earlier (naturally!) and have some time for s love get breakfast (usually some miso soup with tofu, pickles on the side) and a cup of tea. Makes me feel less rushed, and starts my workday in a much better way. "
There is something odd about them to me. Like they are focusing so hard on not making an actual ugly face. It really bugs me in movies or TV shows where you can tell that one or more of the actors/actresses are trying really hard not to make an ugly face. They just don't emote right.
Any way you can scheme to bring them together like you're in your own version of *Amélie*?
"An older co-worker of mine made these jokes constantly until his wife got cancer, then he was crying at his desk every day.  "
"Acknowledging that women have individual likes and dislikes is dangerously close to admitting women are people, and not just riddle-speaking gatekeepers of the vagina. "
"Teddy said, it was a hat. 
So I put it on,
Now, dad says, Where has the toilet plunger gone?

Shell Silverstein"
Aren't those usually due to heavy use of eyebrow makeup?
"came here to say this.  Or men who say they're sooo horny all the time just want sex 3x a week.  My ex said he only had two emotions ""Hungry and horny.""  Spoiler alert, it was actually ""tired"" 99% of the time."
"Relief.  
We were both 21 and traveling. Neither of us wanted kids so it was a no brainer. He was more worried about my safety during the procedure and felt guilt at me being at risk. Afterwards we were both just super relieved and happy it was done with.  
We were together for another 3 years and never needed to refer to our near miss again."
"It's too ""you're not like other women"" for my liking."
Yeah I would have read them all in one day. Impulse control. But man this is a good one.
"I think it’s a great idea. Everyone’s first instinct when a woman comes forward is to rack their brains for mitigating circumstances and excuses to not believe her. Many people do it because they’re ignorant woman-hating assholes, but I think some people do it because they don’t want to live in a world where women are constantly under threat. Sucky as it is, anything that drags more people into accepting that reality is a step in the right direction. 

Personally, I hemmed and hawed before posting because, though I’ve been groped and ogled and threatened like everyone else, I (fortunately) haven’t been raped, so I didn’t want to come off like I have it worse than I really do. But the only people who benefit from that are the people responsible for it. When I say “it wasn’t that bad,” I just mean I’m doing okay, not that these men’s actions “weren’t that bad.” I don’t want to contribute to a situation where the guy who jabbed me with his dick at a bar still gets to think he’s a Nice Guy because he didn’t rape me in alley. Not being raped shouldn’t count as good fortune. "
"Not OP, but I'm disabled and unable to have any more kids - but since I'm 22, doctors think ""I will change my mind"" and won't perform a tubal ligation. I've seen 6 different OB/GYNs in this year alone as my illnesses get worse and it becomes more obvious I can't take care of children. They don't give a fuck."
