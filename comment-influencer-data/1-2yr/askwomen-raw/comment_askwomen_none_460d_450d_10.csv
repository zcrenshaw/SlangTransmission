"You have to wake her in the morning as soon as the sun starts to come up.  I don't know why, and it's not my job to know why, but she must be awake before the sun has fully risen.  She will try to send you outside and then go back to her bed.  Don't let her.  Bark incessantly if you must, but do not let her go back to sleep.  Bad things will happen.  I think.  Maybe not.  I don't really know.

She gets bored easily, so make sure you offer her lots of toys during the day.  It's okay to cuddle with her for a few minutes, but then you must get her another toy and encourage her to play with you.  I think she might get sad if you don't.

You can never eat unless she is in the room with you, and you can never let her eat alone.  She gets grumpy if you sit too close to her food, so watch her carefully from across the room.

At bedtime, you have to get under the covers and sleep on her feet (it's especially helpful if you can situate yourself so that your penis is touching her).  She'll try to get you to move, but hold your ground.  Growl at her, and snap if you must, but do not give up.

Sometimes the male human will come to visit.  If he does, all of the above goes out the window.  Ignore the female human, and follow the male human around the entire time he is there.  Do not let him out of your sight or he may disappear again."

"I mean, assault &amp; other aggressive behaviors, but everyone's already talked about those ones. So I'll say...

When a guy is incapable of cleaning. ""It's a guy thing.""

No, no it's not. It's a messy person thing. I know plenty of guys who consistently keep their living quarters clean."
"I do not remember the years, maybe 3rd-6th grade. There was a boy who everyday chased me around, threw things at me, spit on me or in my hair and tried to physically wrestle me to the ground. I reported it to my parents, teachers, parents reported it. Nothing. It was horrible. My little gang of girls tried so hard to keep him away at recess I remember. Finally, a new yard duty teacher was hired and one day he tried to tackle... I remember her running over, physically picking him up and yelled you don’t like it do you? Touch her again and I will make sure you get expelled. I have seen your record and her complaints. His parents tried to sue but the school finally held their ground. 

She passed a few years ago. I am 31 now and attended her funeral. I did keep in touch with her throughout the years. Wonderful lady and she was not afraid to be herself."
"You must sleep across her neck like a cat scarf. Even though it is summer. She will try to tell you she doesn’t like it, but that’s a lie. "

""And I'm so proud of all my kids.  Bride graduated with a 4.0, aced her [licensing test for job], and has a great job lined up.  Son2 just got accepted into [Famous Ivy League School] to get [boring ass secondary degree]. Son1 just became [regional manager of a bank] and Daughter2....well she's a great mom""


It was just he was so hype about all the other kids accomplishments and then he got to her and was just like ""oh and she's a good mom and also cuts hair real well""


Very awkward"
"Hiking. Walking in nature/the woods. Yoga. Running. Kayaking. Painting. Boxing. Learning to cook new things. Trying new restaurants. Find a used bookstore, buy books. Travel, if you can. Learn a language. Go window shopping. People watch. Listen to some podcasts. Find new music. Go to a concert by yourself. Get a library card. 

*all things I did at 20 after my boyfriend and I broke up and I needed to figure out who I was"
"Go to bed earlier. 

I *need* 8 hrs of sleep. If I don't get it, nothing is going to help me be perky in the morning. Having a consistent morning routine still gets everything done, but if I'm even slightly sleep deprived I won't enjoy it. 

Now days when I go to bed nice and early and sleep really soundly, those days I'll wake up naturally before my alarm goes off. I'll snuggle with my dog for a few moments and then roll out of bed to start my morning routine and not feel rushed. "

"Prod her often with your paw when she's sleeping, just to make sure she's still alive. I mean, it's cool if she's not, you can eat her, but it's useful data either way."
"I can't give you an answer but would like to commend you for asking such a good, interesting and original question.

I'm quite interested in reading some answers about this as well because personally I'm like Julia Roberts in 'Eat, Pray, Love' pre-travelling: counting each calorie and carb just so I know how much self loathing to take into the shower. "
"To quote Cee Lo Green:

&gt;And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best with a ""fuck you"".

It all worked out alright in the end though, because my current boyfriend is a billion times more awesome in every way."
"Last winter I was trying to pass time in a boring uni lecture by flipping through snapchat 'stories'. I saw the 'story' of a girl I went to HS with for one year, but hadn’t spoken to in probably 3 or more years, it was just a black background with a single peace emoji. I thought it was weird but kept flipping through other ‘stories’. I couldn’t get away from the feeling that something was definitely, definitely wrong. I ended up messaging her a bit and chatting with her and she was definitely in a crisis. A few weeks later she told me that she tried taking her own life that night, and after my conversation with her, she went to the ER and was now (weeks later) doing much better and getting help. I can’t even explain why I knew something was off. I was on fb chat with my roommate and asked her what she thought and she told me it was probably nothing, just an inside joke or end to a snap story that didn’t upload properly or something. I was like yeah, you're probably right, and logically, that is what would make the most sense... But still, I somehow couldn’t get over the feeling that things weren’t right. I could just FEEL it. I’m very glad I listened to my gut. "
"The barely concealed disdain for me. It’s like having someone who hates you living by your side - one word responses, eye rolls at any thing you say.
I’m on my first mother daughter trip in the US and I was so excited that my teenage kidult daughter wanted me to join her on her trip - until I got here and realised she just wanted my wallet. She barely looks up from her phone, expects me to do all the organising and paying and doesn’t suggest anything. 
I saw a ‘Grand Central Market’ sign and said hey, I think we are near GC station. She said “it says Grand Central Market, can’t you read?” 
Just unnecessary rudeness and I hope she grows out of it."
"I think she's been single so long, she's simply used to it.  It's easier being alone - no emotional risks to take, no compromises to make, not having to accept another person's quirks and failures.  At this point, she's Seinfeld-esque in her rejection reasons."
"Every Christian wedding I have ever attended has included MULTIPLE speeches that revolve around how the bride and groom are ~finally going to have sex that night. The last one I attended was for a cousin of mine and his best man's speech included something like ""we all know how athletic he is, which should come in handy tonight!"" While one of the bridesmaids referenced how ""sex will soon be your favourite sport"". So. Fucking. Creepy. "
My least favorite example of this is when little boys get away with pushing/hitting little girls and it’s explained away as “boys will be boys” or “that’s how he shows he likes you”. This was said to me by my parents and teachers. I don’t know how common it is now. I hope that we’re teaching boys that hitting isn’t nice and that we’re teaching girls that they don’t need to put up with it. 
"It still hurts once in a while. My ex-husband ended up marrying one of my best friends. They were together while we were married. I actually had a tougher time losing her than I did losing him. All those times I wanted to call her or text her to tell her something funny, I couldn't. When I started dating again, she was the first person that I wanted to tell. When I had a good date or a horrible date, I wanted to tell her. It was a rough for a while. 

I guess the only good thing that came of it is that she is now my kids stepmom, and I know she loves those kids like they are her own.  The bad part about her being their stepmom is that there is a lack of boundaries. She oversteps a lot, and its frustrating. "
"There’s the obvious ones: sleep, hydration, vitamins, especially a B supplement. Eat more protein and veggies, less sugar and starch (these always make me feel groggy). Keep a bottle of water by your bed and drink it before getting out of bed.  
  
Then there’s the mental stuff. I saw this “self help” type video a while ago where a woman described not being able to get out of bed with her first alarm because she was basically miserable with her life. Like, why bother getting up early to meet your mediocre, cruddy life at the door?   
  
But this is what really resonated with me: she said, it’s the small decisions that have the potential to ruin or build your life. The choice to not return that phone call right now, to not rinse your dish right away, to not schedule that appointment, to not put your pants in the laundry. And that stuck with me because I tend to get in an unhappy cycle where I want my life to be better, and I feel like it has to happen tomorrow. Tomorow, I will wake up and clean all my messes, pay all my bills, schedule all my appointments, return all my phone calls. I will be healthy and drink water and go to bed on time and I will finally be happy with my life.   
  
And it never happens that way because that’s *way too much* to handle, so it becomes really easy to shirk that off to tomorrow. And then tomorrow the next day, forever and ever.  
  
  
So now I wake up and I make little decisions throughout my day. No day is perfect, but I can go to sleep knowing that I moved **forward**, even a little bit. And then the next day, I’m excited to wake up and make more little decisions, because my life is changing **now**, and I’m making it happen.

I’ve seen my brother and his friends have polite conversations about sensitive political topics but I’ve seen them scream over the following hot button issues: is a hot dog a sandwich? Is a pop tart a ravioli? Is a bowl of cereal soup? 
"Webster's dictionary defines wedding as ""the fusing of two metals with a hot torch."" Well, you know something? I think you guys are two medals. Gold medals."
"My boyfriend physically attacked me, punched me and my best female friend, all while drunk (we were 19). My uncle and best friend drove him home and informed his father of what he did. His dads response was ""boys will be boys"". Blamed the alcohol use and that he was a boy for his son's behavior. 
It happened another time before I was done with him. So thankful I woke the hell up. "
"A best man's speech full of incredibly inappropriate stories about the groom. He included stories about a time when the groom got so drunk that he actually shat all over someone's basement floor, a time when the groom got drunk and put his head through a wall, a time when the groom got drunk and took off all of his clothes in the middle of a party...you get the idea. The groom clearly thought it was pretty funny, but the bride was mortified. It was completely cringeworthy\-\-I was actually uncomfortable listening to it, and kind of worried about the couple's future. These stories were all presented as events from ""a long time ago,"" but goddamn, it really sounded like the groom, at least at one point, really needed some alcohol rehab or something. "
"I worked at a fast food place that changed their salt from iodine to sea. During the transition we threw the reg salt packets in bags of take out food to get rid of them. Unopened mind you. 



Apparently this is akin to skinning someone’s  dog alive. This dude storms in and starts screaming how dare we put an unopened regular salt packet in with his sea salt fries. Demands fresh fries. The whole 3 minute cook time is being a giant ass and won’t shut up about the salt. Goes to leave and grabs the straws off the counter and throws them all over the restaurant. 



Wherever you are angry fry dude, I hope your life is still shitty because you suck as a human.

"Knowing how to be close and supportive of her without becoming overwhelming.   
It might sound weird, but my mother was overbearing and enmeshed with me. I'm constantly watching and measuring both of our behaviors to make sure we're not getting ""too close"".  
It's exhausting, and yes, I'm seeing a therapist for help. "
"She's so afraid of not having a relationship work out, she'd rather avoid relationships entirely. A giant portion of her personality is that she's good at everything - great at her job, a loving sister and aunt, a tenacious fighter for justice, a reliable community volunteer - and having a relationship fail would ruin the image she has of herself. She never goes on dates, and in fact will actively avoid activities that might introduce her to other singles. Her life is full of love and friendship and family, but she's open about being jealous of her married friends."
"Women have body hair and it's natural. They have leg, armpit, and face hair. It's not gross, unhygienic or weird. All humans do.

"It's also just super weird to talk about your other kids in a father of the bride speech, IMO...no matter what those accomplishments are. The father of the bride speech should be about the couple. "
"I have a happy one!  I was 20, in college, and had just started dating a new guy after getting out of a long-term, not very healthy relationship.  I was really only looking for a fling, but for some reason I could clearly visualize raising children with this guy.  Since marriage and kids were not even on my radar at this point, my response to this was pretty much “what the hell, brain?”

Fifteen years later, I’m married to him and we’re raising two kids together.  Apparently my brain knew what the hell it was talking about."

"Make sure you go to the side of the bed in the middle of the night and stare at her until she wakes up. Just to let her know it’s almost breakfast time. 

At 5am on the dot, wake her up by walking all over her. It may take a minute, so make sure you really dig into the boob and stomach area. 

When she’s doing anything at all make sure you are right beside or behind her. This is very important. Also bark extremely loudly at the faintest noise outside. I don’t think she can hear well because I always have to warn her when a squirrel is running across the yard. 

Lastly, at bedtime lay on top of her. Not beside because that’s too far away. Directly on top. 

"
"Right? My friend keeps saying she has to do the shopping, because  he can't follow a simple shopping list or have common sense and that he doesn't clean properly so she has to do it again and explains it away as a ""men's thing"", like men are too stupid by nature, meanwhile my boyfriend is perfectly capable to do the shopping and household. It's just ridiculous."
"The one in which the best man all but confessed that he was in love with the bride —- his best friend’s new wife.

The best man ended up crying about how lucky his best friend was to be married to this angel. 

This sweet, beautiful, perfect woman. 
This gorgeous, funny, lovely, talented, wonderful, unbelievably incredible woman. 
This “only-comes-around-once-in-a-lifetime” woman.

"I have a friend who, on a night out, declared no one could spend any time playing billiards because she didn’t like it. Our other friend decided he wanted to play anyway, so he bought a game and was racking up. When the first friend saw this, she went over and pushed all the balls back into the pockets.... she’s also thrown a literal tantrum in the street and then stormed off back to her house because we were going to a bar she “didn’t like” (but wanted to go to the next weekend)"

"A best man’s speech that was less about the groom, and more about how rich the best man was and how many cars he’s had. "
"Honestly, the only ones that struck me as bad were the ones oblivious to the crowd. People standing up to have emotional public moments with the bride and groom with little to no context.

&gt;""Remember that one thing Jimmy used to say? \*(hysterical laughter and tears as the bride smiles)\* HE ALWAYS SAID THINGS LIKE THAT. REMEMBER HOW CRAZY THAT DAY WAS? SO CRAZY WE COULD NEVER TALK ABOUT IT, LET ALONE HERE. \*(sparkling tear\-filled eyes over a manic smile)\* BUT WE HAD EACH OTHER THAT DAY. It was so crazy, wasn't it?"" \*(bride is nodding, crying openly now)\*

"I have a Pomeranian. I adopted him right before I turned 20 and was still in college. I raised him from a puppy and did a great time socializing him. He seriously loved every single person that came through my house. It has never taken him more than a second to warm up to anyone. So about a year and a half after I adopted him, I was 21 and he was approaching 2, I brought a boy over to the house after going on a few dates. I had seen nothing wrong with the guy and actually really started to like him.

From the second he walked through the door my dog did not like him. He was very stand offish, which I thought was incredibly weird. Seriously my dog had never met a stranger until this guy. I called him over and he wanted nothing to do with this guy. He didn't growl at him or anything but he very obviously didn't like him. For that reason alone the alarm bells in my head started going off. After he was there about an hour I made up some terrible excuse for him to leave and thankfully he did. When he left my dog immediately went back to normal.

I felt so weird about the situation that I did some google searching on the guy and found out he was a registered sex offender and I found an article about him online. Apparently he had been caught in an online sting trying to hook up with a 12-13 year old. He was a bit older than me at the time so this was like a 24-25 year old trying to sleep with a child. I am SO grateful I listened to my dog and kicked the guy out. He even drove through my neighborhood a few times after. I had blocked him on all social media and my phone. But that was all to ever come of it.

Trust your dogs people!"
"Father of the groom (who stole the speech from the best man) gave the following toast:

""To Lord Jesus our Savior, who's blessed me with such a wonderful son.""  Not a word about his poor new daughter-in-law, mind you.  It then led into his ""born again"" story, which took--kid you not--nearly *an hour*."
"Wake up the man human at 6:30 every morning. Don’t bother with the woman human, and be careful getting too close to her before she wakes up on her own, as she will probably push you off the bed.

Clean their faces with your tongue as often as possible, they never seem to do it themselves.

Make sure they don’t waste any food. Sometimes they drop some on the floor. Sometimes they leave it on the coffee table. So wasteful! Gobble that shit up.

Make sure they go outside a lot. Refuse to go out without them, they need vitamin D."
"Thank you for overlooking the fact that me and your husband used to fuck 

Edit: sorry for the delay, I'm not on here that much. This was said to the bride in regards to her husband. I'm not sure of who the lady was who said it, but the room got quiet of course after a few gasps, then someone shoved her back down in her seat. She was visibly drunk. Nothing came of it from what I can remember. "
My gut is pretty strong in telling me when I'm about to get broken up with. It never fails. 
"Rape, basically. Just yesterday my grandma explained to me that young men have „natural needs“ and things like this just happen.
My dad told me it’s women’s fault that men don’t take no for an answer because „girls like to play hard to get“ in order to justify a creepy dude trying to literally drag me away from my friend in a club."
"I'll say what is probably the unpopular answer, but it is my honest answer. In the 7 years I've been in my relationship, I've had crushes. I met my SO when I turned 21, so I've gone through big life changes during our time together. Combine that with us being semi long distance for literal *years* and his job being one that takes him away from home for long periods of time, it happened.

What you/I do about them is you be honest with yourself and distance yourself from the person. Unless you're planning to ditch your SO and be with that other person (which probably means it is more than a crush), nothing good comes from keeping a crush around.

Nobody has ever come even remotely close to the way I feel for my SO, so I know better. Like someone else in here said, if you don't nurture a crush it passes. Being a mature adult to me is being able to see compatibility from an objective POV and you're really screwing up if you are willing to play into a crush if the person you're with is truly a compatible match."
"As the perpetually single woman in my friend circle, I read all these and wonder which one is me...

The other perpetually single friend in my group peppers every conversation with cringe-worthy self depreciating jokes. He’s also unwilling to date any woman he’s not immediately sexually attracted to. The problem there is that he’s 50, and his sexual ideal is in her early 20’s. Talk about setting yourself up for rejection. "
"I got smacked in the face with a textbook by a boy at school when I was 16. He used the spine of the book for maximum impact. Turns out he fancied me - he started screaming at me another time, calling me a whore because I would date him and didn’t ‘love’ him. That’s some toxic bullshit right there. "
"Being told to ‘go make me a sandwich’ when expressing an opinion.

"Hiking and camping. I love getting out in the woods (or whatever kind of nature you live near) and just quietly existing. Hiking on lesser known or less popular trails, sitting by a fire at night under the stars. Let your mind wander and enjoy the solitude. 

Also, solo travel. For a different reason - you'll have challenges and experiences that make you come into your own and believe in your own capabilities. Travel challenges and expands your world view and beliefs as well, which is what I love about it. "

"My stepmom bought these ridiculous frozen mashed potatoes a friend told her about for Thanksgiving, but she never bothered to ask how to prepare them. So on Thanksgiving day, right around dinner, she's trying to figure it out and is trying to call her friend and is getting furious at her friend for not answering the phone. Like somehow it's her fault that she's at dinner or busy with her own family and my stepmom, as usual, waited until the last minute and is scrambling. 

It was a fun holiday."
"I don't really know how to answer this question. It's normal?

"Oh. Hell. Yes. I used to be super into KVD's everlasting lipstick.. until I found [Black Moon](https://www.blackmooncosmetics.com/). Even if this whole antivaxx shit didn't come out, I'd still be using Black Moon over KVD.

"me getting my ass beat by my brother on a daily basis counts. I had bruises all over and my mom would just say, “he’s just playing. You need to toughen up.” I was a small frail girl three years younger than him. Wtf! I’m 27 and I’m still not over how shitty he was to me from ages 4-16. "
"That enough of them have terrorized women for so long, that it's not a character fault of some women to harbor intense fear around them.  #notallmen is true, but #toomanymenfortoolong is the issue.  

Don't be offended if a woman crosses the street at night to get out of your path - imagine the fear that's ingrained in her and have some fucking sympathy.  Hold it against the rotten apples of your sex, not the victims of them."

"I would recommend birding or plant ID. It's weird how much nature changed around you. At first, the songs or the shape of plants seem like a foreign language, aliens. But if you immerse yourself into the culture, you began learning the language. Then nature becomes familiar and you connect to it. I think the reason why learning nature is so empowering is that you realize that nature isn't perfect but at the same time it's breathtaking. That's you too. You are also imperfect. Filled with curves, soil, rock, muddy water, and dust but at the same time, you are incredible. You are breathtaking. 
"
"It’s never happened while I’ve been with my husband but it happened once or twice during a previous 6 year relationship. I crush on people easily coz I’m the type that wants people to like me. Of course I never had any intention of acting on it. I’d just blush and want their attention, which I believe stems from my needing to feel wanted.

I got over it on my own and moved on because I didn’t *want* to have those feelings, and I sure wasn’t ever gonna cheat or leave my ex. So I just let it run its course."
"Ogling and inappropriate touching. When I tell people about this or when female friends are telling about instances like this (getting caressed on the back with the man's hand wandering lower and lower is *by far* The most common thing heard, goes for hugs as well) people - even women - are not even surprised. None of the women have ever said 'boys will be boys', which gives it a kind of positive, fond twist, but their answers usually come down to 'it's gross and inappropriate, but it's just the way a lot of men are'.

Well I find that unacceptable. Men are human beings not animals who can't control their urges. My arse is off limits to anyone who isn't:

A: my SO

B: my doctor and only when something is wrong back there

C: me

Aside from that: cheating. I'm really surprised how many of my friends are of the opinion that it's totally normal nowadays to have a more or less open relationship because 'men just *can't* be monogamous. It's in their DNA. It's a scientific fact!!11!!!oneone!!'."

- Must collect or be involved in the art world

I've asked if she could have flexibility on *one* of these characteristics. Nope, it's all or nothing. I've tried explaining the math to her, that she's essentially eliminated 99.996 percent of eligible men in the dating pool. "
"Hello! I’m a radio astronomer doing my PhD on the magnetic fields around radio galaxies. Radio galaxies are pretty much what they say they are: galaxies that are bright in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e. the very longest wavelengths of light). They’re caused by something called an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN, basically a very energetic core at the centre of a galaxy) emitting jets of radiation. I look at the polarised radio waves that they emit and interact with. The angle of polarisation of a polarised wave (the angle between the plane of oscillation of the wave and a defined reference plane) rotates in the presence of a magnetic field due to the Faraday effect. By looking at this Faraday rotation, I’m looking at the magnetic fields between me and where the radio waves were emitted. Magnetic fields may be invisible, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t study them from afar! "
I'm a Loud Laugher. I laugh too loud. Like this: ha-HAA! Everything else that's annoying about me probably takes a little bit longer than one or two dates to come up or get on people's nerves.
"Ugh. My ex was like that.

I wrote out a grocery list and left it on the kitchen counter. I intended on going home after work, changing clothes, then going grocery shopping. But then I got stuck at work late, so I texted him and asked if he could take the list and go to the store.

His response?

""You're better at that than I am,"" and he didn't do it.

I was ***furious*** and made damn sure I didn't pick up any items he wanted during that shopping trip."
"Mom of four daughters here. They're 35 to 28, all married, and three have children. 
That's a wicked tough question you've posed. I would have to say the HARDEST parts aren't things that automatically jump to mind like dating, house rules, drugs, going easy on the make up, the way they dress, becoming involved in the community, making and keeping true friends, the importance of school, etc.... but so many OTHER things that were ALSO never covered with me. I had a super crappy mother, and none of the above was discussed. 
When I met and married my husband I suddenly realized I had very little idea how to actually run a home! Thankfully, I had taken Home
Economics Class in High School, which taught me how to cook, sew, do laundry, iron, and shop for groceries properly, even using  coupons. 
Therefore, when I had daughters I made absolutely sure I began teaching them at a very young age how to do all the things my mother was too busy with her career to teach me to do. My father taught me to be very proficient in the workshop, so I also taught them those skills. I also taught every one of them to drive both a manual and an automatic transmission car.  Their dad ... my husband of 36 years... and I both agreed when they were very young that ANYONE should be able to grab a set of keys and drive ANY vehicle in an emergency. To move it, to get someone to the hospital.... whatever. So they can. He's also taught them all how to do their own basic car maintenance, too. Additionally, they can all change their own flat tires on the side of the road, and have, in the dark, with no help. Because they had to. And because they could. 

So, all of that was my answer. I could go on.... My daughters are AMAZING individuals. But this is already long. 
I hope it was helpful. "
Anything that would make it seem like they've compromised their masculinity. If your friends are going to think you're gay for having a skincare routine then they suck...Since when is taking care of your skin a feminine thing? It's a human thing.
"The relationship between Christians and sex is... bizarre, to say the least. Abstinence education is the only sex talk you're allowed to partake in until you're engaged and then everyone talks about your impending sex life. I imagine it's pretty awkward and disappointing for newly married Christian couples who have had sex built up to be this magical and spiritual thing. "
"Our culture has a stereotype of nerdy intelligent people being poorly dressed and awkward. A lot of media focusing on fashion goes hand in hand with more shallow media (e.g. the fashion spreads and who wore it best type articles in People Magazine or Cosmo). Also, people might assume if you are devoting a lot of time to intellectual pursuits, you won’t have time for “frivolous” things like fashion. A lot of people are calling out sexism, which I don’t disagree with, but I think there is more to it. "

I get suspicious around New Yorkers who have no friends of color. 
"i've also noticed this. i think it's because we grew up being told if not by our mothers, then by media and movies that men who don't look so good on the outside deserve love too. whereas the princesses and heroines boys are exposed to are always beautiful, no exceptions."

I wish my mom had a reddit because I would honestly love to hear her versions of some of my more harrowing teenaged years
"Using outliers as examples of men's plight. The existence of  false rape accusations does not negate the prevalence of rape.

Also, men using other men's struggle ONLY as a counterpoint. It's funny how some guys don't give a shit about male suicide, rape, family court, etc until they need to use it as a counterpoint in discussions with women. If the only time you invoke male issues is to silence women's issues, you're trash."
"A more literate version of what my idiot cat would write:

* Make sure you sleep directly behind her legs or on her chest at night to make her feel loved
* Yell at her in the morning to give you kibbles so she knows to get up and eat her own kibbles
* Stare at her until she takes her morning medicine
* Give her lots of kisses
* Sit on her as often as possible. When that's not possible, sit touching her. When *that's* not possible, sit somewhere so you can stare at her
* Otherwise, let her do her own thing. She's mostly self-sufficient, just needs reminders for food sometimes."

"The best man was groom's younger brother, he got up and said, ""I remember when you were a kid, you went through a Ninja Turtles phase. Now, you're going to go through your marriage phase!"" There was some forced, sparse laughter but otherwise it went over like a lead balloon."

"I suppose it's not quite the same, but I had a dream once that this guy broke into our house and started stabbing my husband repeatedly. He was skinny, wore a hoodie under his jacket, dark hair, sharp nose and had a weird green light around him. I woke up in a panic, about 3am, and talked it over with my husband. I have really bad anxiety and horrible nightmares that he helps me through. Well, we decide to head out for a midnight drive. A guy starts trying to flag us down, but before my husband could stop I start shouting, ""That's him, don't stop! DRIVE!""  It was the same guy from my dream and was standing under a yard light that had a green tint to it. We sped back home and locked our doors. "
"At the wedding for my brother and SIL. SIL’s father is very uninvolved in her life.  Gets up to give his speech.  Word for word, here is his whole speech: “Groom: get a helmet and earplugs.

"After my ex-husband became verbally abusive, cheated on me repeatedly, and left me homeless and without income to raise our 8 month old son alone, one of the guys that I thought was a friend to me (had been a mutual friend) was happy to rant against his cheating, but told me that once the marriage was over I shouldn't expect or want any help raising my son because ""Men just don't have any interest in babies."""
"Can’t tell you. I’m thinking of food for 90% of the day. I have to constantly keep track of my calorie consumption because if I don’t my weight WILL go up. I sometimes binge if I keep certain things in the house. If someone decides to spontaneously eat out and invite me, I go into panic mode because I know I don’t have the caloric budget to eat out and I’m probably gonna end up overeating.

I get the impression that a healthy relationship with food is not feeling stressed or having to plan eating out a day in advance. You think about food when you’re hungry and don’t think about it when you’re satiated. 

I don’t know. Sounds like a good time, though hahahaha. I’m trying to work my way to having a normal relationship with food"
"God this makes me furious. I’m sorry you had to endure that with no help from adults for so long. Hopefully it didn’t leave any lasting psychological scars.

When I was in 4th grade there was this kid named Kyle. Back then I was a shy, slightly overweight girl with glasses and he singled me out for abuse. Everyday he would hurl insults about my looks, my weight, and any other insecurity he could perceive. He drew pictures of butts and put them in my desk (4th grade...). He encouraged the other boys to gang up on me and told the girls that I was gross and if they hung out with me that they were gross too. It was because of him that I had barely more than one school friend that entire year (I had friends outside of school, thank goodness). 

The few times that I complained to an adult it was brushed off as “he probably has a crush on you.” Fucking really?! 

Fortunately my mom found out about what was happening, went into full mama bear rage mode, and marched into the school office. “She will NOT be in class with that boy next year, got it?” At the time my mom volunteered pretty regularly in my schools admin office and basically ran that place, so they complied pretty much immediately. Things got so much better after that. 

Fuck you, Kyle. And fuck anyone who dismisses boys tormenting girls as “a crush.” That assumption is either completely false, or worse, it’s true and that behavior is taught/encouraged. "

- European men that are 6'2"" or above - 6,250

- European men that are 6'2"" and blonde - 487

- European men that are 6'2"", blonde, and multimillionaires - 9

- European men that are 6'2"", blonde, multimillionaires involved in the art world - I'm guessing less than 9

- European men that are 6'2"", blonde, multimillionaires involved in the art world, and **single** - Way, way less than 9

"Growing up in PA and then living in LA for a long time, I was introduced to this foreign concept that eating healthy means you *feel* better.

"For me, it's not that I need ""less sleep,"" I just need more ""awake time."" Like, after commuting home, taking care of pets, having dinner, cleaning up, etc. there isn't that much time left over for me.

"Play fetch at all times. At *all* times! She's on the toilet? Bring her a ball. She's eating? Bring her a ball. She's existing in your vicinity? Bring. Her. A. Ball.

If she doesn't immediately throw it, make sure you pick it up and forcefully throw it back on the ground to get her attention. Sometimes she gets distracted by her video games, or food, or important tasks and needs to be reminded of her priorities, which is to throw the ball.

If this *still* doesn't work, make sure you whine and cry, and shift around to remind her that she needs to throw this bal. 

Do these steps even after she has been playing fetch with you for an hour or hours throughout the day.

When she finally gets irritated enough, she'll say, ""Penny, enough!"" That is when you must go sulk in your ""cave"" for a while, until it is time to begin the process over again "

My worst fear after living it first hand 
"""I have to be so careful now because I'm afraid women will accuse me of sexual harassment""


Meanwhile, women are *actually fucking worried about being sexually harassed/assaulted/raped/murdered*



I'm so sick of certain dudes acting like that fear is somehow worse than actually being raped.  ""If it's false it could ruin someone's life!!"" You know what actually ruins someone's life Chet? Rape. "
"Based on my experience, I'm assuming they are referring to how vicious teenage girls can be - both as bad influences and as bullies.

When guys bully they will usually just be straight up aggressive and it's easier to distinguish as a problem.

When girls bully they can be very manipulative and play mind games and it can really fuck with your head. You can tell people Person X is horrible and is clearly trying to push you out/make mean comments that sound like nice ones/acts in a way that makes you look like the bad person, and people either won't believe you because they're nothing but lovely to them, or they know what you mean but don't think it's worth acting on because otherwise they're alright. This can lead to a teenage daughter going through an emotionally rough time that can effect multiple aspects of their life, and as a mother you can't really do anything about it.

I'm not saying teenage boys aren't also capable of this, but I know far more girls who can relate to this sort of experience than guys."
"I remember one where the father of the bride said something along this: "" I was  wishing for my daughter to marry  a good man, but she decided to go with  (name of the  groom)  I hope you do not get divorced in a couple of years and you learn  how to run a house, because  this man looks like he likes  handmade tortillas, and you do not even know how to blow your nose""  

Too much tequila.... was involved... also the bride was my cousin...   it was embarrassing much.... since then  my sister and I decided we would skip on a big wedding  :D

Edit:  LMAO... my sister and I decided  we won't have big weddings each one,  not that we would marry...    Gosh!"
"I’m not a mother myself, but I’m 22 and it wasn’t that long ago that I looked at my mum like she was the lamest person on the planet and I was too cool for her. You can never say for sure, but chances are, she’ll grow out of it eventually. I thought my mum was trying to ruin my life but now it’s pretty obvious that she was just trying to do the right thing by me. She’s one of my best friends and I value every second I spend with her. I hope it has a happy ending for you and your daughter too ☺️"
"I love ants, and know an absurd amount of information about them. If I see one on the sidewalk I will definitely be crouching on the ground to identify it and proceed to list off everything I know about that species. I also actively catch queen ants and raise them and their colonies. So I have a bunch of ants in test tubes sitting around in closets in my house because they need warm dark spaces."
"Years ago I went to a wedding as a plus one. The MOH’s entire speech consisted about how she actually went out with the groom at first, but there was no spark, because he was ‘such a snooze’. Then he later hooked up with the bride who was ‘perfect for him’.  It ended with her saying she’s the reason this wedding is happening so ‘you’re welcome’. The whole speech was so cringe. Luckily the best man went after her, he had a really beautiful speech. "
"She's not very interesting. She doesn't have any hobbies/passions, she's using outdated pictures on Tinder (she's gained weight and wonders why she can't get a second date), and she has a list of arbitrary and unnecessary demands, like height. She's pretty unwilling to compromise and is pretty... It's never her that's wrong. It's always everyone else. She's deep in denial about a lot of stuff. And she refuses to meet people via people she knows. She will not be set up under any circumstances."

"I’m a high school student. In class I dropped my pencil sharpener and it exploded *everywhere*.

I want you on your hands and knees cleaning that up!’ I wasn’t implying you were a janitor but ok."
I can feel my period about to start.
"I'm not the first to say this (and it's more a wedding toast I've heard ""of"" and I don't even know that it happened at a wedding toast) but any toast that ends in someone proposing to someone else at the wedding where the toast is being made is a pretty bad wedding toast in my book."
"Still going through it. Some days are good, some are not. Part of me still loves him and wants him in my life, but I know that this is for the best. He was my lover and best friend, so I think that's why it hurts even more. We both used to tell each other that we were our ""ones"" and I truly believed that he would be the person I would grow old with. "
"Canadian here. We began phasing out the penny a few years back, because pennies are ridiculous.

I was working retail at the time. We had been provided signs, the same signs at every other establishment in the city, stating how a penniless transaction would go. When paying with credit, debit, or cheque, no difference at all. When paying with cash, you would receive change rounded up or down to the nearest nickle. If your total was $1.22 and you gave me $2.00, your change would be $.80. if your total was $1.23, and you gave me $2.00, your change would be $.75. Simple, easy, no problem.

I had a woman come through my til and pay in cash. I gave her her change, and she stared blankly at it for a moment before blinking at me and asking where her pennies were. I politely informed her of the new government changes regarding pennies and gestured to the sign, where further details were located.

Cue her FLIPPING THE FUCK OUT. Utterly beside herself, bewildered, demanding her pennies. I didn't actually have any in my til, since, well, almost nobody by this time carried them, and we could no longer order them from the bank.

I had to call a manager to have her escorted from the store. It was outrageous. All this llama drama over two cents."

"I was once on a double date with my boyfriend, his best friend and the friend’s girlfriend. We were at a restaurant and had just gotten our drinks when she checked her Facebook and noticed that her father had posted a picture of her she didn’t like. She went completely ballistic, started to cry loudly and uncontrollably, then she called her father and screamed loudly at him over the phone, asked him why he always had to humiliate her. The whole restaurant was gaping at us. After she was done screaming at her father she stormed out of the restaurant and her boyfriend after her. It was a very surreal experience for me especially since, between her and me, I had always thought I was by far the more vain one. I also saw the picture, it was a group picture on which she had her eyes closed, I didn’t think it was that bad."
Waiting until they have daughters to realize that women are humans.
"Women are mainly valued for their looks. If they deviate from a narrow acceptable standard, that's a problem. Men are valued for more than their looks and have a wider range of acceptable appearances."
My favourite is when parents don't teach their son(s) to be cleanly because they're men and then act shocked when they move out and can't keep a place clean. Like what did you expect to happen??
That giving rights and representation to women does not mean they have less rights.

"He doesn’t want a real relationship. He only wants the romance of the honeymoon stage. He wants rose petals on the bed and shit like that, but when things get real and he starts to be reminded of the fact that he’s dating a real person, he’s not interested anymore. It’s a bummer to watch because he’s dated some really good people who’ve stepped up for him when he needed it. For some reason though, he always dumps the ones who’ll pick him up when his car breaks down or go grocery shopping with him. Normal life shit. "
Sounds like she went Full Boyle.
"I love this but also as a woman be very careful. I’ve solo traveled to Mexico and within the states and been fine but I went to the beach nearby alone (something I’ve done multiple times with no problem) with plans to camp out until a man followed me, tried chatting me up, wouldn’t leave when I asked him to, and then began trying to grab, hug and kiss me. I had a friend call me, gave my location immediately upon answering and picked up quickly and left. He followed me to the vehicle of course but by then my friend knew exactly where I was. Some men won’t take no for an answer. Be very careful and have an escape plan. "

"Staying in touch with her while also giving her the space to become her own person. Because they NEED to push you away, but they also NEED you to not let them get away totally. 

So I do lots of cups of tea and lots of errands and outings with just us. So she can talk when she needs too but also not make to much of a THING of it so she does not feel like she has too. 

I'm just a noob at this, she's 13 :-) But that is what I'm trying to do.

Had a dream that I was driving past my friends house and an old lady who is never seen was waving. Woke up and just had this feeling that something was wrong with my friend. Couldn't explain it at all so sent him a message just asking if everything was ok. His grandmother had died that morning. Was so damn strange...

"Two stand out events in my life:

Had a gut feeling my brother was borderline alcoholic and on the verge of getting a DWI because I was pretty sure he was driving drunk sometimes. I told my mom about it after she was on vacation with my dad and there was a bad incident at home. He ended up getting a DWI about 4 months later. He is actually now in jail for his second and third DWI within 10 years. Thankfully he is sober now - he went through rehab prior to sentencing. 

Another was just in December. My husband was having issues after a colonoscopy. I couldn't tell exactly what was going on but knew it wasn't good and kept pushing him to go to the doctors. He refused even though he was in too much pain to work. After about a week I finally had to call an ambulance because he passed out after having a shaking fit from the pain. I told the ER doctor everything and four hours later he tried sending my husband home because his results were fine. I told him absolutely not and that he must admit him to see a GI doctor. They admitted him but the doctor wasn't a specialist and again, tried sending him home. I said absolutely not. Through a series of really serendipitous events, a GI doctor arrived 30 minutes later, right as my husband was being discharged because he wanted to go home (I tried fighting him on it). Turns out my husband had C Diff caused by antibiotics and the colonoscopy. If he waited any longer to see a GI doctor he would have needed surgery. He is still having complications from this. "
"A bit of background: I struggled with an eating disorder for many years, starting around the age of 14 to my mid-20's. I don't struggle with it anymore, except for the occasional bad day.  
  
To put into context what a healthy relationship with food is, I'll start by going over an unhealthy one:  
  
An unhealthy relationship with food is when you hate or fear food. Or perhaps you feel like you can't control how much of it you eat. You can't stop thinking about it, you become obsessed. Every time you're asked out to eat with family or friends, you panic because you know you're in for a bad time. Because it will get out of control.  
  
In comparison, a healthy relationship with food is what we see in a lot of comments! You don't obsess or continuously think about food in a way that makes you panic or get anxious. You eat because you're hungry. The food you eat gives you all the nutrition and energy you need to go about your day."
"Mine was at a wedding a year ago (ironically the same one with the [bachelorette party from hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8naes4/what_was_the_worst_bachelorette_party_youve_ever/dzufhqg)). As ""just"" a bridesmaid, I'd known the bride for years and was one of the folks who was going to give a toast. I was not her MOH. The night before the wedding, at the rehearsal party, the bride pulls me aside and tells me that she's changed her mind, the only one's speaking will be the Best Man and the MOH. Ok, that's fine, whatever.

Fast forward to the next day, the ceremony was a disaster, the bride made us take all her photos outside in cold, November, Wisconsin weather, and it's ten minutes before the reception. It's just me and the MOH sitting in the car when she pulls out her speech and starts reading it to me, saying how nervous she is. 

That's cool, I can give advice. Most jobs, I've worked as a writer, so this is fine. It was awful. I wind up completely rewriting the ending for her. The entire speech was about how the bride and MOH got pregnant at the same time,  and for each moment that the two of them shared, the MOH would reveal a letter that would ultimately spell out the couple's newly minted last name.

We get to the reception, and she gives her speech. It was absolutely cringe\-worthy. The entire audience was so full of second\-hand embarrassment as the MOH just kept pulling out letters like a weird magician. Finally, she delivers the last couple lines, the ones I wrote, and the bride starts crying. It sounds like a humble brag and I guess it kind of is, but it was cool that since I didn't get to speak, what I wrote was what ultimately hit home for my friend.

Anyway, at the very end of the night, we've all winded up at a bar (it's a Podunk town in Wisconsin, our options are limited). The Bride's mom comes up to me and says ""God that was the worst speech I've ever heard in my life. I know Bride didn't want you to speak because of timing and everything, but I wish you could've.""

It was the worst wedding I've ever been to."

"My bf used to try this until I sat him down and expressed how annoyed that made me. It was always “but there’s whole carrots and then there’s baby carrots, I never know what to get, you’re better at knowing what to buy” and i finally told him “then text me, call me, I don’t care” so now he does go grocery shopping when I can’t do it. I get calls and texts the entire time like “frozen or fresh? What’s cauliflower supposed to look like?” Sometimes I google search images for him and will send it to him because he literally has no idea what some things look like. His mother cooked mostly boxed foods growing up so it wasn’t just an excuse like I had thought for a good 3 years. He couldn’t tell the difference between lettuce and cabbage. It blew my mind. "
I can’t think of an answer right now but I just want to say this question had me howling laughing.

"A friend was getting married in a low-key outdoor setting. By the reception (actually, even by the ceremony) one of her bridesmaids is PLASTERED. 

It had been planned that she and the MOH would share a toast to the bride, and they'd written the toast together, practiced it etc. 

It was like watching a play where one actor forgets all of his lines. The MOH is trying to keep it together but the drunken bridesmaid is going off script all over the place, and taking uncomfortably long pauses to just smile and cry at the couple. 

Unfortunately, she didn't let her embarrassment end there. She gets up to give a SECOND toast, that includes classics such as ""who would have thought YOU would be getting married before me?"" and asking the bride's father for a job. "

"I really appreciated the boundaries and closeness I had with my mom as a teen so maybe our relationship could be an example.

My mom never got directly involved with any of my interpersonal relationships with friends and love interests while I was navigating all of the awkward social situations a typical teen encounters. She listened and gave advice when I asked for it, but she let me make my own mistakes and trusted me to figure most of it out on my own. She would gently guide me sometimes, but never said “you shouldn’t hang out with so-and-so” nor did she badmouth any of my friends. But when a few friendships ended in drama, she was able to explain some things to me as an outside observer that helped me recognize what went wrong.

My mom was pretty overprotective of me growing up, but once I hit my teen years, she really took a step back and let me do what I wanted to do. In a reverse-psychology sort of way, the fact that I didn’t have to fight for freedom like I expected to meant that I was more motivated to not disappoint my parents by doing anything really dumb and risky. I mean, I did plenty of stupid teen stuff, but I also felt confident to stand up to peer pressure since I had fairly good self esteem.

My mom was and is always the type to lavish on compliments and express love and affection, but when I became a teen there was a change in our relationship where she purposefully pulled back a bit and was a lot less involved in how I ran my own life. I felt like both my parents trusted me and I appreciated them saying “If you ever get in a situation where you don’t feel comfortable, no matter the time of night, you can call us and we’ll come get you, no questions asked.” 

Even now as an adult I like to call up my mom to chat and hear her advice, but we are also very much separate people and I don’t feel like I’m a disappointment to her even if we don’t agree on everything. We respect each other’s boundaries.

I work hard on some of my outfits to pull them together, I like when people recognize that.  But telling me how my body makes their parts tingle, I want no part of that.

"Because many people view having stereotypically feminine interests and appearances as dumb and vapid.

 I find that even many women who claim to be against ""sexism"" espouse these views and take immense pride and joy in eschewing all things stereotypically feminine and judging women who enjoy fashion, makeup, cooking, etc. as lesser. These women never seem to realize that they are the very definition of ""misogyny"" while railing against it.

"I think that cleanliness and house stuff is really overlooked in relationships. Because, in casual dating, it's easy to dismiss a slob, or think that cleaning your boyfriend's place is your contribution since you hang out more, or that it's only messy because you're Netflix and chilling, or other ways that those expectations just sorta... slide in. 

I went to a friend's house, and her boyfriend (who she lives with) asked if he wanted her to bring in the trash bins. On Tuesday. Trash day is Wednesday, and she'd just put them out. He didn't know when trash day was, but wanted credit for offering to bring them in. Pretty microcosmic of their relationship, tbh"

"I had one that I remember because I ignored it, and I shouldn't have.

 I started a new job and despite the fact I'd been looking for a job for a while, I just had a weird feeling about it. They'd just told me I had the job (it was just waitressing for a casino, nothing fancy) and I had this weird feeling like I shouldn't do it. I can't explain why, because the casino itself wasn't dodgy or anything, it was a normal chain casino that my flatmate worked at. But I had this strong feeling that it was a mistake. I needed the job though, so I took it.

Worst mistake of my life. The place was *hell* for waitresses (and waiters, for that matter). Most casino patrons are blind drunk and pissed off because they're losing, and they take it out on whoever's serving them drinks. I was sexually harassed multiple times every night, groped a few times a week, screamed at by alcoholics constantly. It was a big floor, so I was always running around taking things back and forth (often to people who ordered, then fucking moved tables so I had to run everywhere trying to find them), and because we were always understaffed due to high turnover I usually didn't get any breaks. I'd never had any issues with my weight before or any issues surrounding food in general, but that place made my self esteem and my mood drop so low I'd developed an eating disorder within months that saw me become so underweight you could see my ribs. I took to trying to hurt myself to try and get a day off work, and I still have a massive burn scar on my hand from where I shoved it into the permanently-hot oven we kept to cook pizzas. Eventually I got fired for sobbing in the toilets after a customer screamed at me because there was ham in his ham sandwich. Thank God. I don't ignore my gut feelings anymore."

Go to the gym.

Spend time hanging out and catching up with friends.

Kinda put yourself out there. It’s fine not to be ready for any sort of relationship for a while, but I’ve found that being friendly and flirty with guys at the gym or wherever helped me realize that there was so much out there other than the guy I just left. Plus it’s just fun.

I also colored my hair and went shopping for some new clothes. If I had more money I would get some new piercings and tattoos. I find that appearance changes make me feel more distanced from the person I was during my relationship.

These are all just things that have helped me since my breakup 2 months ago. I hope they are helpful for you too. :)"

She wouldn't take advice but would constantly ask for help on how to make her relationship work when its a borderline abusive relationship. We would tell her to get out, find someone who treated her better, someone who would respect her even, she would agree tearfully- and then go right back to the asshat.

"Worked in a preschool and one day we caught four 4 year olds, two girl and two boys, pants and undies down on the playground, showing each other their stuff. Obviously we had to tell the parents to make sure this didn’t happen again and so they know what happened in case one of the kids comes home saying “I saw so-and-so’s privates today!” The little girls were scolded by their moms when they came to pick them up, given a talking to in front of their teachers and classmates, and you could just tell they were in trouble. 

The boys parent’s came to pick them up and one of the dads, after being told what his son had done, locked eyes with him and gave a devious smile- as if to say “you little rascal, I know what you did!” Then, laughing, told him that was “silly” and that was the end of it. The other boy’s mom, when told what he did, just rolled her eyes at us and said “a typical boy, am I right?”"

"Answering this as the daughter: I told her I hated her and I wish she was dead so many times and of course in the moment I thought I did. From about 13-17 we only ever communicated by fighting or talking through my dad, around my 18th birthday she got suddenly really sick with viral meningitis, and seeing her in the ICU and my dad talking about what would happen if she died (there was like a 50/50 chance) made me really realise that of course I don't want that to happen and I love her. Even if this hadn't happened I started to mellow out a lot more at age 18 and wasn't so angry and hateful all the time.

I moved out at 19 and that made our already-healed relationship even better, and now when I see her our time together is much more meaningful and we appreciate each other a lot more.

I don't want to be a mum because I don't think I could spend 12/13 years spending all my time and money on a person and then have to go through 5 years of them hating me."

"A speech by the father of the bride who was maybe a bit tipsy but trying to adlib it anyway. He rambled on for what felt like hours (much of it not relevant), stole part of the MOH speech (she'd written it down beforehand - I saw it as I was in the wedding party), broke down into tears while incoherently going off on a long tangent that mostly involved congratulating himself but somehow swung hard left into an anecdote about the time the bride almost died as a child. He barely talked about the groom (small percentage of the very long speech). He rounded the whole thing off by kissing his daughter on. the. mouth. Which was very obviously not a normal thing and something she was horrified by. I saw the expression on her face as she tried and failed to dodge it. The whole thing was.... spectacularly bad.

Thankfully the rest of the wedding and speeches were lovely."
"Instructions from Creeper- cuddle her at every possible moment, even if she says no, otherwise she gets lonely and starts talking to the tv.

"Well. Something a colleague mentioned after coming over for dinner at my place was that it's weird how I don't have furniture.

It's something that comes from when I was broke as shit and couldn't afford things like couches. As a result I sit on the floor on a cushion and sleep on a futon and mounted the TV on the wall instead of getting a TV-stand. So I guess it looks really clinical if you're not used to it.

But what upset him was the amount of clear, unmarked bottles in a room with only a coffee table.

I like to take off the labels of vodka bottles. But looking at it now, it does look like I could be a mad scientist/my apartment is where I bring my murder victims.

I don't know. I'm just glad that he didn't check out the room with all the corpses. It just makes me look needlessly suspicious.

"I went on a fun girls trip to New York a few years ago.  It was me, my roommate, and two other friends of hers.

"A lack of structure made me crave it, and by 6 I was setting dinner times, cooking dinner, making chore lists and writing out rules that included bed times. As an adult I am extremely anxious without clear guidelines, a stickler for the rules who would rather die than jaywalk. 

The only negative I can think of is the acceptance went too far. Moments like when she caught me working out at 12 \- she was deeply upset, going on diatribes about how it's so unnecessary to strive to look a certain way and that my body should just reflect my life naturally... which led to me having a huge mental block and not working out again until I was 30, with all the subsequent weight issues that come with that. 

What I've noticed is I am the same person as my mother, the same aura really, but I approach things from the opposite end. Our collections of small rocks, scraps of fabric and sticks are displayed with my minimalism to her clutter. Her freedom of expression manifests in feathers in her armpit hair while mine lies in a carefully crafted aesthetic. Her poetry is often found poetry*, I write sonnets. 

I am my mother's daughter. I grew up in a removed but open and accepting home, and I treasure that oasis of chaotic creativity and varied outside experiences that led me able to snatch bits and pieces as they flew by to lay about me like a Bowerbird."

"Learning some type of art form! It's cool because you can learn what your painting/sculpting/drawing/etc style is, and who knows? You may even invent a new one. I also think it's a good idea because you can learn what types of themes you depict and what it says about you. In addition to more traditional forms of fine art, I like make up artistry. I follow a few accounts on Instagram and it's interesting to see what people do with it (and I'm talking unconventional colors/patterns, too). I understand that it may cost money if you don't really have any supplies though :( With make up artistry though that might not be as much of a problem because you don't necessarily have to buy high\-end products to do cool things."
"My favorite tale from working in food service: 

Customer: I'll have 2 pork egg rolls

Me: I'm sorry sir, but we are currently out those.

Customer: What!! This is the *third* time I've come in here and y'all are out (he was probably right- our kitchen manager sucked at getting stock food orders correct based on sales). 

Me: I know, I'm really sorry...

Customer: STOP BEING A *CUNT*!

"I’m a teacher now and the current movement is to teach students about steps they take when someone is doing something they don’t like: stop, walk, and talk. First, they tell the person to stop what they are doing because it hurts their feelings/makes them uncomfortable/etc (they should try to stand up for themselves verbally); second, if they keep doing it walk away and hang out with other friends; third, they talk to an adult. 

When a 7 year old walks up to me and says another student pushed them, sometimes it’s a little difficult to figure out the truth. I usually talk to the accused and say “I didn’t see it, so I’m not sure what happened, but I just want to remind everyone that we keep our hands and feet to ourselves and work through problems with words. 

At my school we have this very cute/cool program where student volunteers can go through a training and get these little vests to become conflict counselors. They help friends settle disputes as a 3rd party. "

"In Eastern Europe the tradition is to give women flowers on March 8th. Not just wives/girlfriends, but parents, daughters, siblings, teachers, colleagues, bus drivers, whatever. 

So I had just got off Skype with my cousin, who was gushing about the amazing bouquet that her boss had given her, feeling kind of sad that there are no flowers in my house because I'm in the UK where nobody has even heard of this tradition. There is a knock at the door, I answer it, find the cute stuttering guy I had first encountered at my best friend's birthday party the other week. He brought me flowers because he heard it was the tradition in my part of the world and that I might be feeling left out. I answered ""yes"" before he could even finish asking me if I wanted to get coffee.

In hindsight, my best friend probably put him up to it, but it was still very romantic."

"I imagine it may be different for others, but I was taught things like:

* Never embarrass men or make them look bad in front of others. This includes not seeming smarter than them or doing things better than them.
* Always give them respect. This includes listening to what they say and not questioning them.
* Work from the assumption that they are right. If they aren't, find a way to help them correct themselves without feeling like they were wrong or like you pointed it out.
* Pay attention to what they say, what they don't say, and their physical and expression cues. Don't need to be told that they want or need something. Learn to anticipate their wants and needs without being asked.
* Don't provoke or anger them. If you do and they lash out at you, that's on you for knowingly upsetting them.
* Manage their life around them so that they don't experience things that are unpleasant to them.
* Gracefully accept that they are going to give you sexual attention and learn to defuse that attention without embarrassing, upsetting, or otherwise provoking them. 

That isn't to say that I believed or enacted all of those things, but they are things that were taught to me both explicitly and implicitly. As u/svabaten said, a lot of it is about seeming gracefully inferior."

Needless to say I was horrified and brought the conversation to a grinding, awkward halt when I wondered if her dad was a psychopath. Which was, of course, highly offensive.  "
"I believe linking isn't allowed in this sub, so here's a brilliant comment from another post on this very thing. This is from another redditor (not sure if I'm allowed to name them, will HAPPILY give credit to them if anyone wants me to share the link via DM).

&gt; Reddit tends to have a black &amp; white view of cheating that I find naive. Crushes tend to walk the line of emotional cheating, but honestly I think they happen in even the most healthy relationships, and as long as you both want to work through them, they are worth working through.

&gt; My wife and I have dealt with crushes several times over our 10 years together. Once for me, and twice for her. I swear, if I asked reddit for help during the times she had crushes, cuz it was shitty times, it would have told me to walk away with a couple hundred upvotes, and that would have been the absolute worst advice. We've been married two years now (though we've been devoted to each other for ten years) and could not be happier. Each time has been a chance to make both ourselves and our relationship stronger. So, I decided to share our success with reddit to maybe help other relationships. Obviously you should leave a relationship that is not healthy, but I don't think you should throw away a relationship. (Note: The crushes all happened before we were married).

&gt; What are crushes?
&gt; Crushes are accidental feelings someone has for another person (i.e. not their partner). This is different from people who seek out relationships via Tinder, etc. Usually they are with a coworker or classmate, because these are people they bump into a lot. They develop a friendship, and either over time or sometimes quite suddenly, they feel they ""hit it off."" They might feel the infatuation so strongly, it's like they are in love again. They probably feel confused and incredibly guilty because they love their partner so much, how could they feel such strong emotions for another person? And for you, it must feel like a huge breach of trust. You gave them their heart, how could they?

&gt; I think it happens by accident, and it's normal, and it's hard as shit, but as long as you both truly love each other and truly want to get past it, you can. And your relationship will be that much stronger if you do.

&gt; What are the right conditions for a crush to occur?
&gt; Crushes happen when there's a perfect storm of variables: EDIT: I got some feedback on this so I'd like to change it. Crushes can happen at any time in a relationship for a various reasons, though I think the most pervasive crushes occur when there is a perfect storm of variables:

&gt; 1. The relationship is strained Every relationship goes through hard times. There are ups, and there are downs, and crushes tend to happen when there are downs.

&gt; 2. You or your partner's life is strained outside the relationship. Maybe money is tight. Maybe work is in overdrive. Family is sick. Life really sucks sometimes, and it can make us stressed, which can transfer into our relationship. We are more tense, and show our love less. We might still feel it, it's just harder to show because we're constantly stressed about other things.

&gt; 3. The partner is at work/school more than at home awake. This one is pretty much all the time. We'll be at work or in class more hours in the day than we are at home with our partner. Then he is accidentally spending more time with a coworker or classmate than he is at home. Maybe they share an office, maybe they are in all the same classes. He's not trying to seek her out, they just happen to be in the same place most of the day/week.

&gt; 4. The crush represents what you are dissatisfied in with your partner This might be kind of a cold way to think about it, but relationships can be thought of in terms of Pros &amp; Cons. For example, my wife is not into sci-fi like I am, but this classmate did. We bonded over our favorite Star Trek series, and before I knew it I had a crush. In reality, my wife has a hundred more ""pros"" than this crush, but this crush had a pro where my wife had a con.

&gt; So, your partner has a crush... What now?
&gt; Like I said, my wife and I have dealt with this several times over our relationship, and each time we've set ground rules, and each time we've come out stronger and more in love than before.

&gt; 1. Keep open and honest communication at all times, and work through it TOGETHER. Don't hide your feelings from your partner, even if you want to protect the other person. You might not want to talk about it, wether you have the crush or they do, but you HAVE to communicate. You HAVE to know what your partner is going through at all times. Work through it together, and you'll come out together.

&gt; 2. Don't be alone with your crush (like never meet up for coffee), because while she can't avoid working with him, she can avoid seeing him other outside of work. Meeting up like that is a chance at taking intimacy to a deeper level. You might want her to cut off ties to him entirely, but often that's next to impossible to implement. Think of this like a ""soft"" cutting off ties. Think about it, you have your ""work friends,"" and then you have your ""friends you hang out with."" It puts a barrier there.

&gt; 3. Never complain or joke about your partner to your crush Even the most innocent joke can indicate you are not happy with your relationship.

&gt; 4. Spend more quality time together. These crushes happen in part because we are at work/school more than we are awake at home. So, overcompensate a little. Turn off the TV, get off facebook &amp; reddit, and play board games or go for walks. I always think the free dates are more intimate than going out to dinner &amp; drinks, because that can feel like throwing money at your relationship, but those can be fun, too.

&gt; 5. Don't give ultimatums!! This is a very common tactic in these situations, and I think it only does harm to the relationship. It might seem like a good test of their devotion to you, but when you are emotional (which you definitely will be if you are going through this), please consider you might not be setting a reasonable ultimatum. More importantly, giving any ultimatum (however reasonable) tells your partner that you value your needs over your relationship. Even more importantly, giving an ultimatum forces them to work on the problem on their own, voiding the chance to work together, which is in violation of rule #1 above and makes it 10x harder to resolve. It says to them, ""I give up, it's your problem... fix it or it's over."" My parents got married on an ultimatum, so believe me when I tell you it doesn't work the way you think it should. I'm glad they got married and all because I exist and all, but that shit never got resolved.

&gt; Giving an ultimatum ends the relationship, no matter what your partner chooses.
&gt; However, in the end, if your partner has a crush, maybe it's not worth it for you to work through their crush. It's a really hard process, and maybe you're not up to the challenge. Maybe you really do value your own needs over this relationship, and wouldn't mind breaking up, which is why you might be tempted to give an ultimatum. But let's be real, that's not because of their crush, or anything they did, it's because you don't value the relationship enough to keep working at it when things get tough. And maybe you shouldn't value it, maybe it's a bad relationship and you should give it up, but just be honest about why you're giving up, (and don't give an ultimatum).

&gt; These above rules are really simple, and are relatively easy to implement. It's the emotional turmoil the whole thing puts on your relationship that is hard. Obviously, you need to set your own rules between you and your partner, I'm just sharing what's worked for us. I hope this helps you if you ever find yourself in one of these not fun situations.

&gt; With the first crush, we set these ground rules together, and we've stuck to them, and they've all passed over. We were able to figure out the issues in our own relationships that contributed to crush happening in the first place, and so our relationship is that much stronger."
"“For a long time I considered not showing up to this wedding. But here I am, and I feel like shit. Everybody knows that I really, really don’t like you, the bride. Don’t you dare mess with my brother. Dear brother: I love you and always will. Cheers!” Said by the sister of the groom who literally grabbed the mic right after his speech to the bride. The party kind of died out after that. "

"How's that even work? Being a good dad when the child's little is *easy*. My son's only 2, and it seems to me like being a good dad to him just means some simple chores like cooking, bathing, and changing diapers from time to time. The rest, hanging out with him, reading and playing, that's not even *work*! There's nothing better than seeing him playing with his toys and getting excited about something silly. Plus, when he gets tired, he wants to cuddle!

My nephews are all older, and it seems like *that's* when being a good dad is harder. Dealing with different personalities, more serious interpersonal conflicts (""Don't bite people"" is easy)... that scares me."

"My mother, basically everything. But the latest and dumbest tantrum was due to this line of events:

1. I'm visiting the parents for a long weekend;
2. Parents are gonna travel Sunday morning to a place they know I hate;
3. Parents ask me if I'm going as soon as I come to their house - I say no;
4. I prepare to go home on Sunday morning, and mom asks me again if I'm going with them. I say no, mom throws a fit about how she had 'trusted' me to go and told people I'd be there.

I'm sure I have more, but this was probably the most unreasonable one."

"UGH. My best friend comes from a pretty religious family, and her little sister recently got married. Her family all really dislike the guy and didn't want them to get married, but they were both so ready to have sex that they basically got married just so they could bone. And the family all agreed that rushing into marriage was better than having pre-marital sex! My bff, god bless her, was really concerned for her sister and worried that her first time would be traumatic, and had to work up the nerve to give her baby sister The Talk before the wedding. I hope they're happy together, I really do, but of all the stupid reasons to get married.

The same thing happened to a friend of mine who wanted to take his long-time girlfriend on vacation, but her daddy wouldn't let her go because they weren't married. So they got married! They threw together a cheap, tacky little ceremony in a week and got married so she was allowed to go on the trip. They're a good couple and I'm happy for them, but it's disgusting to see something as important and beautiful as marriage rushed into just so people can have sex with their parents'/god's approval."

"My sister flipped out because my son's First Communion was being held in a church.  She said we did that on purpose just to exclude her (she's a practicing Pagan) and didn't speak to me afterward for years.  I'm still blocked on Facebook and this happened in 2011.

"When both of us are home, almost every time, even if it is just for a minute or two of “overlap” - like, she’s finishing her shower and I jump in before she gets out.

"I was walking into my local liquor store (in broad daylight, after work) but I could see from afar that there were three guys outside the door in such a way that I'd have to walk through them. I don't usually care, especially not in daytime or in the area I live in, but I was in my work skirt and heels and I suddenly felt vulnerable. I must have shown this in my body language as I got closer when one guy having a smoke said ""Hey, how are ya!""

And then I felt silly, because with the sun in my eyes I couldn't tell that it was the owner I've seen a *million* times and knows my face and is a very nice old guy. The other two were his friends, I guess. Real wholesome-looking guys once I lifted the veil of ""threat.""

Anyway, I felt sort of dumb but then it occurred to me that he probably understood my hesitation and that's why he called out in a friendly way."

"I am this way too! I think it boils down to being sensitive to seemingly small changes. Things like: he stops calling on his commute home, he doesn't want to go out anymore, he gets quiet around my friends/me, etc. The problem I always face is I try to give him the benefit of the doubt. ""Don't be so paranoid, he's under a lot of stress, he needs support not an inquisition"" and then not too long after I'm single and wondering why I didn't spare us both the heartache and leave when my gut told me to."

ETA: the dog is okay, he moved out with me."
"Showed up at my apartment. Begged me to stay. When that didn’t work, threatened to kill himself. I told him that if he was feeling suicidal, I’d be happy to arrange transportation for him to a nearby hospital. So when he realized *that* wasn’t going to work, he told me about how “worried” he was for me, because he knew I was afraid of ending up alone and just couldn’t imagine anyone else loving or being able to “handle” me. To which I responded, “That’s fine. I’d rather die alone than end up with you.”"
"I think blood and guts are hilarious. One of my favorite stories to tell is how in my first autopsy the doctor accidentally dropped the bag of organs and they splattered everywhere. Just how it happened was so funny and his reaction.

"I think moderation is the key. I usually eat whatever I want and workout consistently as well. When you are physically fit, you actually start craving healthier food to fuel you. 

In America, there's a huge problem with portion. Everything very large and has to have that ""instagram"" blow you away factor (desserts that look cool but probably would not eat or triple cheese burgers). Americans celebrate excess and eating contests. You need to shut out that distraction. 

I have a weakness for certain types of junk food, but I never go overboard with it. I never force myself to finish a meal when I feel full, even if it was expensive, and I will order dessert, and only have half of it, or just a few bites. I NEVER binge on something and never go on extreme diets (juice fasts). "

periods
"Just to make be clear, not all Christians are like so. I'm Christian, SO is Catholic. We're getting married in July, sex is present in our relationship and has been for years. Same to our other Christian friends. "
"That we have periods and that they sometimes have debilitating symptoms with which they just cannot empathize. They can empathize with elements of it (body pain, nausea, digestive troubles, etc) but the *collective experience* of really bad periods is 15/10 awful and sometimes we need to take a few days off because of it. We aren't complaining. You wouldn't be functioning if this was happening in your body either."
"I try not to nurture them as well, by reminding myself that I’m almost certainly crushing on the idea, not the reality.  The reason the beginning of a relationship is so intense and passionate is because we are swept up in the honeymoon period, in the lighthearted, surface level good.  We see primarily the desirable aspects of our (potential) partner.  The real test of a relationship comes after, when we begin to see (or let ourselves acknowledge) the bad.  

Everyone has a public face, and a private face, and what’s so special about long term relationships is that, with our partner, we don’t have to maintain the separation of the two.  It’s not so much that people’s public face is bad, or hides deep, dark, terrible secrets: it’s more that with others, we may not be seeing the full picture.  

So when someone flits across my mind, I remember that if I pursued that individual, I’d be sacrificing the long term comfort I already have, in exchange for the short term passion they could provide.  And for me there’s no question which I’d choose."
I had this argument with a friend once. She thought that when I said “not spicy” I meant it in a condescending way like she just couldn’t handle the small amount of spicy.

After a while, I started to realize I could find information both for and against vaccinations, depending on how I googled the question. I consider myself a smart person. And I couldn’t stop finding scholarly articles and websites that clearly show how beneficial vaccines are. 

I realized I was being dumb. Falling for the hype. Falling for the social media storm of misinformation. I realized I cared more for the health and safety and LIFE of my unborn child. My kid is fully vaccinated. "

No. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm just not sexually attracted to anybody and I think sex sounds incredibly unappealing (not that *all* asexual people think sex is gross, but some of us do). That's all there is to it. "

My life got so much better.

I know it sounds EVIL for a teacher to give up on a student, but... They gave up first. I've spent all semester trying to motivate these three kids and they've refused my every effort. I'm not going to keep throwing myself against a brick wall. If (when) they fail this class, it'll be because they rejected my every attempt to get them to pass. No guilt from me!

When my ex asked me formally if I wanted to be exclusive, my first reaction was no. I talked myself out of saying no because I liked him and I honestly had no bad reason not to date him. It was just a weird gut reaction. I should have listened. 

The second time that happened with another guy, I listened to myself and immediately said no. Again, the guy was nice and nothing was wrong, but I learned to trust my gut.

When I met my fiancé, I wasn’t looking for a relationship and I thought the date would be a 1 time thing but when I met him I swear to f-ing god I saw his aura. I had never experienced that before. There was just something he radiated at that moment and I knew I should pursue the relationship. In full disclosure it wasn’t love at first sight. It took me a few months to fall in love. It was just something about him, his soul or whatever. 

I also really believe in listening to the universe as hippie as that sounds. When everything starts crashing down around me, I know it’s because I wasn’t listening and now instead giving me a nudge to make different choices, the universe is forcing me too/making the choice for me.  When I do listen, it feels like everything just falls into place and works out easily. "
Me too! And high school. And now I miss it. 
"Two cute little toddlers were running around the supermarket saying ""hello!"" to everyone."
"Cheating. 

""They can't help it, it's in their DNA!"" just sounds like a cop\-out. However, that excuse is never used to explain why *women* cheat.

I don't condone cheating on either side. We're an evolved species. Control your shitty urges."
"I haven't done any new research since I finished my PhD last month but I'm a linguist who studies the spread and conservation status of the Gaelic language, specifically in Scotland, and short-term unidirectional and long-term cyclic drift and cross linguistic influence in Scots Gaelic in relation to English, as well as dialectal prestige."

Holy shit. What's it like to have family who think of you as subhuman? I'm sorry you have to deal with that :(
"I worked as a substitute teacher while I was working on my master’s degree. I look pretty young, and the students have always loved my tattoos and, at one point, I had pinkish purple hair that they’d flip out over. Most schools I worked at were totally without problem, but there was one school where a lot of the kids had families that had a little bit of money. 

I was subbing eighth grade. This kid had been held back a couple of times. He was about 6’1 and heavyset, build like a linebacker. He was saying racist shit to another kid and I told him it wouldn’t be tolerated and he needed to go to the office. He told me he was going to rape me, strangle me to death, and then cut off my head and fuck the mouth of my corpse. I reported all of this and the office literally said, “oh he’s just being a boy. You look young so he feels like you’re a peer and he can talk to you that way.” 

W H A T?!?! It’s OKAY for him to talk to young girls like that?!! To ANYBODY like that? They made it seem like if I pressed the issue I wouldn’t be asked to sub again, and that school district paid a little bit more than the others so I didn’t wanna get banned from an entire district.  

Turns out his daddy’s company had been contracted to fix a few issues at the school (he owned a construction company) and had bought some new equipment for the football team. This kid wasn’t gonna get in trouble for shit. "
"Last night I was struggling to brush my hair (it's long and we had been swimming) and my boyfriend took the brush, without me asking, and spent a good 10 minutes brushing my hair, being gentle so he didn't hurt me. That was one of the sweetest things he's ever done for me. "
"Instructions from my male cat — Make sure she sees you as soon as she gets home or else she will find you and promptly give you way more pets than you’d know what to do with. I mean, unless that’s your thing. Go to the food bowl when you want attention. She will give you food AND pets instead of seeing through the boredom you’re trying to alleviate outside of running around like a goddamn maniac &amp; opening all cupboards with the agonizing noise of an ogre at 3am.

Instructions from my female cat who has social anxiety —"
"We were laying in bed almost asleep and I'd known I wanted to tell him for a few weeks. And then he said ""can I tell you something?"" And I said ""only if I can tell you something first."" And then we both said it. It was super cheesy and cute. But I knew I felt it and I wanted to share it with him and be in love together."
"Tried to kill me and very nearly succeeded. Took me a number of months to be able to walk again, but I kept going."
"I'm glad you explained this, because I was debating if this was an autocorrect or a really scary drink I want to run away from."
She is currently pregnant and has come out as an antivaxxer. She’s an idiot.
"I have a quiet personality, so around people I know I'm usually just in the background (which is fine with me). But with strangers I can fake an upbeat, energetic conversation because I know it only lasts for so long and I don't have to have any ""deep"" interactions that will affect me."
"There is no equivalent.

Men are taught to be kindly superior. Women are taught to be gracefully inferior.

It’s an opposition of power."
W.T.F? That’s so... odd. Some parent/child relationships are just so weird.
"He’s a flipper. 

A flipper?

Yeah, a flipper. "
"I feel fine about it. I’m Canadian and will be living within walking distance of a provincially-owned store. I’m not into pot so it’s not a big deal to me, but I’m glad it’s legitimizing the reality of pot in our culture. 

I don’t love the smell or weed culture, so that’s going to be annoying till people learn how to behave with it being legal. "

"Agreed. I don’t think the fathers reaction was bad necessarily. I think the little girls parents should have laughed it off as well. That being said, little kids need to be taught that it’s not always safe to show privates to one another. "
"I guess my dealbreaker would be that I don't think Seinfeld is funny. Like, not even a little bit."
"I had a textbook healthy pregnancy with my son. I’d never been pregnant before, but had no fears about labor. Something in my head kept saying, “you’re going to have a c-section and it’s going to be okay.” I couldn’t explain it, nothing was ever wrong at my ob appointments and I’d never had unexplained sureness Like that. I even turned down free Lamaze classes because I just felt something telling me I didn’t need them. The day my water broke it became clear that the placenta was prematurely tearing away from my uterus- my son was losing oxygen, and I was losing blood FAST. My ob rushed me into emergency surgery and saved my boy’s life (and mine). He’s two now, super cool, totally healthy, and I have a newfound respect for my intuition. "

I learned to do most of these things in my late 20's. It's never too late!

"Ironically (her being your daughter and all), I doubt it's personal. Puberty is a motherfucker and she's trying to find her own identity. Part of that is rejecting their old identity, which in many ways is 'child of'. Obviously no-one can know for sure, but odds are good she'll grow out of it."
"Jesus.  I missed that one.  Yeah, it's not a good idea because you're trying to force me to be polite in a situation where I'm increasingly threatened.  I feel bad for women who would actually be polite in that situation, because they've been conditioned to be polite even at their own expense.  
  
With me you get one ""no thanks"" past 10pm, and if you continue to pursue at close range, the pepper spray is coming out.  I live in the city and I don't have a responsibility to engage long enough to find out whether you're a crazy person or just socially inept.  A woman was shot in the head (and SURVIVED) a few blocks from my apartment by a salty dude this week.  I am NOT required to risk my safety to make men feel better."
"""You deserve to be taken care of, you're too pretty to work""

Fuck that. I want a career."
"Nope.

This was *before* we got to eat dinner, too.

It will probably not surprise you to learn that there was a forty-five minute sermon during the ceremony. I was a bridesmaid, and we had to stand through the WHOLE THING."
"Or imply the Ninja turtle phase never ended, like, ""And I hope *wife* likes sleeping on ninja turtle pillow cases."" "
"I have a friend that I think is cute but she doesn’t dress well or do anything with her hair/makeup. Her dating profile pictures are headshots (she does acting sometimes) where she looks so lovely but is also wearing makeup and has her hair curled. I think guys are surprised when they meet her and she doesn’t do anything for her appearance when all of her photos are of her dolled up, and consequently, she never gets second dates. I think she could totally still get a lot of dates if she changed her pictures to be of what she looks like daily, and these guys wouldn’t expect her to look like a model, but she insists on only using headshots. "
My dad blew up at me because I set the table the wrong way and refused to listen to my apology. He got over it later but really? *Really*?
"""She's a howler?""

"Japan isn't as outlandish as most people think. Outside of Akihabara  people are not anime crazed and otaku culture as a whole is largely frowned upon. Though the stigma has lessened over the years it's far from what most people expect.

The Japanese are just normal people, if somewhat socially conservative."

"From experience: 

1. Go out all the time, party, socialise, tell the world you’re doing great!   
2. Have a big cry because pretending to be great all the time is exhausting.   
3. Go back to normal.   
4. Eventually you realise you’re not pretending you’re doing great because you actually are. It’s going to be OK.   "

"1 - Coffee. Just fresh coffee, strong, no sugar, and just a little bit of skim milk. Also espresso and espresso macchiato. Some of the best coffee I’ve ever had was local Guatemalan coffee when I was visiting the country.  
  
2 - Peaches. /u/JoyfulStingray has it right, peaches that are fresh and in-season are the best fruit in existence. They’re juicy and bursting with flavour and make literally any day better. Hard, woody, out of season peaches are the worst.  
  
3 - Corn and tomato salsa with a little bit of feta on tortilla chips. Yessssss.  
  
4 - Roasted asparagus, onion and peppers on a grill, with spicy sausage. One of my favourite summer BBQ items.  
  
5 - Bumbleberry tarts! It’s apple, rhubarb, strawberry, blueberry, and blackberries in a simple tart shell. Not the frozen pre-made tart shells you can get at the store, but like a homemade, flaky shell.  
  
Bonus - tacos, but there are too many variants for me to narrow it down. "
"Every big feminist blog, YouTube channel, and so on that I've ever seen has constant mentions about how sexism hurts men too, how the prevalence of male suicide is horrific, how men get sexually assaulted too and it's just as bad, and so on.

Where are these guys even getting the idea that bringing up these issues is even a 'counterpoint'?"
I don't think it's really a question of literal time but more a question of when the relationship has developed to a point where those subjects are appropriate. Does that make sense? Like I might build a connection with someone quickly and that sense of trust and companionship develops almost immediately. Or I might know a person for years and never quite reach that point. 
I think one thing is that girls and women are taught to be very careful with a man's feelings. 
"When they try to tell me that I don't know how women act. Bro, I *am* a woman. How I act is how women act. We act all the kind of ways. If how some women act annoys you and how I act doesn't, go find women like me. Unless you like complaining ... in which case, the way this woman acts is to not listen to that."
"I shouldn't have looked. I knew that thread would be disgusting.

I have dated a guy who was overweight; he'd actually been much heavier before but had lost a ton of the weight and gotten muscles. Still a bit heavier than most though. It didn't matter to me, except for the fact that he was self conscious about it. I want to be completely comfortable with my SO and for them to feel the same about me, in all aspects.

There are many overweight guys who are incredibly judgemental of women's bodies and like... who do you think you are? Women are held to a MUCH higher standard by society, including other women."
She's a lesbian who always falls for straight girls.
"This happened to me a few times when I was in a relationship a few years ago - mostly likely due to the fact that my ex neglected me both sexually/physically and emotionally and i was beaten down so bad (emotionally) that I didn’t have the courage to leave. I never cheated on him though. 

But with the guy I’m seeing now? Never. Not even celebrities. "
"Ugh, that sounds awful.  I always tell people\-\- don't reference being drunk, drugs, or anything sexual, don't joke about being attracted yourself to either person, don't be drunk yourself, be under five minutes."
Blew my brothers mind this weekend by telling him practically all women throughout history had leg &amp; armpit hair. Think he just assumed razors were always available

"Nah, he'd be buying me newer more expensive dishes every time he did that. My ex did that shit and I will die on that hill before playing those games again. "
"This is more his intuition, but here’s my side of it first. On my now-boyfriend’s and my first date (June 16, 2016), he hugged me goodbye and I remember thinking, “Oh, this is what it’s supposed to feel like” - a thought that resurfaced the first time we had sex and he cuddled me afterwards. I had the strangest feeling that he just somehow felt “right,” you know? Like I’d known him before.

About a month after we started dating, my dad passed away unexpectedly. My boyfriend was the first person I called, and the only one of my friends who dropped everything to be by my side. 

Now, it’s going on two years and he is so much like my dad it’s scary. But one thing that amazed me was I was telling my mother about our first date, and she started laughing. Her first date with my dad was June 16, 1976.

My boyfriend later said that he had two gut feelings - like thunderbolts hitting him, he said. The first one was when I got out of my car on our first date and started walking towards him. The second was the day my dad died and I called him crying. He said he realized that I was “it” for him both those times."

Those are all excellent questions though....
"I'm a CouchSurfer.

Thanks to a bunch of thirsty guys writing aspirational articles full of what they hoped would be the truth and those articles being shared for shock value, people think that CouchSurfing (or any hospitality exchange) is some sort of sexual thing. It couldn't be further from the truth."
Whaaaat? You mean that childhood behavior and adult behavior could be connected? -sarcasm-
"Not a mom, but from my mom's perspective -- she did everything right. She was not too strict and not too lax, she raised daughters who got straight A's, went to top colleges, and never even touched drugs or alcohol. She didn't have to force them to do this; they seemed to be born with an intrinsic desire to be ""good"". What she didn't know and couldn't control was their emotional state. Oldest spent her teen years secretly self-harming and suicidal only to have a mental breakdown before going off to college. She suffered with anorexia for years and finally has it somewhat under control at the age of 22. The youngest? Her whole concept of ""good"" shifted in college, and while her grades held up, she became dependent on alcohol and would rarely go a day sober, even though she's only 18. You can do everything ""right"" and your kids can still suffer. You won't know why and it will tear at your heart. Mom, we're sorry."
"You could at *least* go for ""and Daughter2 is an absolutely amazing mother to X fantastic children"" or something like that."
I was in a job interview and I just had a bad feeling about the guy I was interviewing with. I was offered the job but turned it down. A few months later I saw him on the news because several of his employees were suing him for harassment. One of the quotes was: “He’s worse than Hitler.”
"My mom experiences a lot of things like this. One time my aunt came over for Christmas with her children and husband. They drove back home after new years and heading back to Idaho. My mom woke up terrified in the middle of the night in sweats. She thought of her sister, prayed until she cried, and called her immediately because of gut feeling. My aunt told her that they just got into an accident, the SUV flipped, and landed towards a hill from the side of the road due to a blizzard and slippery highway. The Kids were crying but thank God everyone was okay. My mom thought it was strange and so did our family. Also recently, another aunt died from Colon cancer and my mom woke up feeling she passed away. Check her families facebook and found out she passed away. 

My mom has had gut feelings with my sisters relationships in highschool. All led to heatbreaks. Just recently she told me she had a gut feeling about my friend that likes to hang around my sister. She told me he's the man who's going to marry my sister. Not sure how that will turn out but he's a good guy.
