"I made changing my sheets a happy event thing.

Each Monday I change my sheets and do a pamper evening thing, with a facemask, a longgg shower with scrub, loads of lotions after. Have a nice drink,maybe do yoga.

Then when I'm at the cleanest I'll ever be, I'll grab a fresh pair of pj's and go to bed early to enjoy some shows in my little cocoon of perfect. "

"Well we started dating as teens and my priorities were way way different then, as you can imagine

At one point he had to practically carry me bc I couldn't walk.  He completely switched to a plant-based diet for me.


He's truly ride or die.  This was before we were even married so he hadn't made vows at this point.  He just accepted it as a new fact of life and exceeded all my expectations.   I'm not sure what you'd call that quality. Loyalty? Devotion? Empathy? IDK but he has it in spades "
"1) moms judging other moms

"Not me but my older sister (she’s a cam girl). Her sugar Daddy is actually someone she met online and she helped him through depression and a really bad divorce. He lives across the country and will occasionally send her gifts and amazon gift cards, but because he isn’t crazy rich we jokingly call him her Splenda Daddy. They actually have a nice relationship and he’ll even occasionally send my sister’s fiancé gifts too. "
"My aunt is a hypochondriac and would read medical journals all the time. I was a weird kid and thought they were fascinating. However I started experiencing the symptoms I was reading about. By the time I was 9 I had everything from crohns to lupus. My mother banned the journals after I tried to convince her that I had an aortic dissection. 

One day I fell and hit my arm and got a weird bruise. I'm dark so it was the first time and I didn't know what to do with myself. I didn't have my books to consult with so I put all my medical knowledge to the test and diagnosed myself. I had elbow cancer. 

I knew what I had and that my time on this earth was limited. I talked to my brother and left him all my belongings after I died. I spent a week telling everyone how much I loved them and how great  they were. Until the bruise started changing colors. I finally told my mom my diagnosis and that the end was near, my elbow cancer was going to take me that night. After nearly peeing her pants laughing and calling my dad at work she finally explained that there is no such thing. So yeah when I was 9 I thought I was going to die of elbow cancer because I got a bruise. "
"On our 11th year of marriage. 

I think the biggest thing is the ability to accept and adapt to change. You and your partner weren’t the same person 10 or 15 years ago as you or they are now. And they won’t be the same person in another 10 or 15. They’re going to have new hobbies, new aspirations or dreams,  they are going to grow and learn as a person and have different views of the world (as will you). It’s important to respect these changes and be flexible and supportive of them. It’s important for them to give you the same in return.

"This is all just really embarrassing, not too bad... The first gynecologist I ever visited, was the same gynecologist my mom had.  I decided that I had better be honest with a doctor anyway so, I proceeded to tell the gynecologist that I had sex for the first time several months before.

This led to a long lecture about how no one should have any sex unless they were at least engaged (she kept pointing to her finger to indicate a ring) and how I should be ashamed because I was 17 and having sex.  And on top of all this I'm sitting there totally mortified that she's going to go and tell my mother (she didn't, as far as I know, but tbh I think even if she did my mom wouldn't have told me).

This idiot doctor also very grudgingly gave me BC pills which I requested, but told me that alcohol negates the pills, so I proceeded to refuse to drink even a single drop of alcohol until I was 23.  Which, on the whole is not _bad_ I guess, but in retrospect I am really really pissed about being lied to. I felt like she was imposing some Puritan no sex no drinking values on me instead of giving me the proper information and allowing me my own decisions."

"I'm a gamer, but I don't give a rat's ass how ""challenging"" a game is. A lot of the gaming community wears it like a badge of honor, like the more anxiety-producing and frustrating a game is, the more ""legitimate"" it is. 

Life is too short and my time too precious to waste it not having fun. The games I like are the games I like. I'll never play Dark Souls or Cuphead, purely because of their dire reputations, and that's fine by me. 

Along the same lines, I'm a reader too, and there's this attitude that if you don't read dense and antiquated classic novels, you aren't a ""real"" reader. I see this on the books subreddit a lot. Geez, just let me enjoy my modern tripe, please. "

"liking your partner the way you like a friend. the kind of friend where even if you're fighting, you can sit in stony silence and play a game together or watch a show until you feel like you can talk it out. and talk it out you will, because you're the kind of friends who are family, and it's uncomfortable for all to have lasting discord in the family."
"Last week my husband of 4 years decided he wants out of our marriage. No infidelity, no intimacy issues, no fighting. He is looking at apartments and deciding how to split up our stuff.

It was magical. And I made a new friend."

"Yup. Met this guy in college, supported him when he came out to his family, welcomed him into my family, just absolute inseparable best friends for like 2 or 3 years. Inseparable meaning, he kept clothes at my house, facebook friends with my whole family, came on family vacations with us, the whole shebang. After 2 years he joined the Gay Men's Chorus in the large US city we live in and began hanging out with guys who, for no apparent reason, hated me. A few months after he joined, we planned a vacation to Seattle together.  A month before, he let me know there had been a lien on his tax returns and he wouldn't be able to reimburse me for the plane ticket for a while. I said it was totally cool, whatevs, family and all that. Instead, he just never spoke to me again. Deleted me on Facebook, then blocked me, blocked my mom too. Four months after that, I called him crying at midnight because my dog got really sick all of a sudden and had to be put down, and I was having a tumor removed the next day. I left him a voicemail, but he never called me back. I never really dealt with it. I still wonder what I did wrong. I just wish I knew why he cut me out. "
"Emotional intimacy with friends, family, and significant others is promoted and normalized. And it's wonderful.

"From what I've seen, I'm treated more kindly than a lot of men I know, and my depression is taken a lot more seriously. A lot of my guy friends don't feel able to seek help, or like they need help, whereas I feel like emotional help is very accessible to me."
"One semester during university, I was experiencing terrible stomach pains: vomiting and diarrhea. I go to our school clinic and get examined by an old man Dr. 

He says off the bat ""you're pregnant."" No test, no nothing, just ""you're pregnant."" I was a 19 year old virgin who hadn't even kissed a boy yet, I knew I wasn't pregnant. The Dr bullies me into a pelvic exam, all the while the nurse is in the room holding my hand and saying ""men have it so easy"" as the Dr shoves a speculum up my vagina. My tears of pain informed him that I was indeed a virgin, and he decides that he now needs to shove his hand up my rectum to ""check things out."" 

Ten years later and I'm still horrified by this. Oh, my mom took me to another doctor. Turns out stress had given me an ulcer. "
"Getting up early enough to do things for yourself first thing in the morning.

It can be really tough when you have a long commute or get home late or have family responsibilities, but I find getting up even fifteen minutes early to read a chapter of a book or half an hour to watch a TV show helps get me in the best mood, rather than getting up just to start getting ready for work."
I work out not for the health benefits but because I'm vain.

"We went out to a normal dinner, on a normal night, after I had come home from work. We were waiting for our food, and he said, “I’m not sure why, but I REALLY missed you today.” And then he went on to say he never stops thinking of me and he hates calling me his gf, and would I ever consider being his wife... I said that I would marry him in a heart beat. And that was it, we sat there and stared  at each other for a few minutes and said, “so.. now what we do?”. 

So we told our parents and a few friends and we were married 3 weeks later. No ring, no big surprise. Just a normal conversation at a normal dinner, that changed our lives. "

"I don't know about sprays and stuff but it can depend a lot on your natural hair type/texture. I have type A1 hair which means that it's naturally superstraight, super soft to touch and very shiny and healthy looking. I don't do anything to my hair, I use random drugstore shampoos because my hair just genetically looks good. The downside of having this hairtype is that I have 0 volume, my hair is always very flat, it won't hold a curl to save a life and the hair strands are very thin."
I started with forcing myself to act with self love. Exercising. Eating right. Self care. Silencing negative self talk. Slowly the forcing became real and now I really do love myself. 
"I hate going all the way to my building's stinky, creepy trash room to dispose of my recyclables, but I do it faithfully even when I'm feeling lazy because I'd hate it even more if anyone saw me putting cardboard or something down the trash chute - what if they confronted me? My social anxiety fortunately trumps my laziness and forces me to be a good recycler."
"Makeup artist: BRING INSPIRATION PICTURES! People often try to describe the look they want...totally wrong. You have no idea how many people tell me they absolutely do not want a smoky eye when really, they want a smoky eye. They just don't know know that a smoky eye doesn't have to be black and gray. Even if there's 25 pictures on pinterest that you like and you can't narrow it down to one definitive ""this is what I want,"" it'll at least give the artist a general vibe of what you want. The most stressful thing is when someone says ""I don't know, I just want to look dramatic but natural."" Just have some pictures ready. "
"Appreciation. He never takes me for granted nor I him. I’m currently on maternity leave but when I’m not I work longer hours than him so he picks up the kids and cooks dinner. I always thank him and 9 times out of 10 he comes back with something like, “Thank you for gestating our babies all those times” or “Thank you for breastfeeding our children and keeping them alive when they were born” or “Thanks for being so smoking hot all the time.” He’s being playful but I’ve never once felt taken for granted - a lot of my friends’ husbands only comment when something they expect ISN’T done, not realising a simple act of acknowledgement is worth so much. "
Cauliflower instead of anything delicious. 
"I'm Chinese and growing up, our household was a weird mixture of Western and Eastern influences. Lots of funny stories revolve around food. Like the time my friend came to my house afterschool and we walked in to my mum chasing a crab across the floor with a cleaver. Or my other friend who accidentally put soy sauce on his chips because he thought it was vinegar, and that's when I realised that other people put vinegar in their oil/vinegar sets and not soy sauce...

But my funniest story is probably the time we attempted Christmas. I was around 10 years old at the time and we had never celebrated Christmas at home before but I really wanted to do it. So I excitedly told my mum all about the Christmas traditions. We went and bought a tree and decorated it in early December, we had gifts under the tree, we had stockings up over the mantle. I explained to my mum how she had to pretend she was Santa and we would leave out some milk and cookies for 'Santa' and Santa would leave us presents, and the stockings would be filled with toys on Christmas day. We would have a Christmas lunch with all the trimmings. I showed her all these pictures I had printed out from catalogues of what it should all look like.

Come Christmas day, my younger brother and I go downstairs to open the gifts and I discover that all of the gifts are just wrapped up cardboard boxes. Just empty boxes. Then in our stockings, my mum had put our old toys in them so I pulled out like an old doll from years ago and my brother had some random bits of Lego. I guess I forgot to explain to her what presents actually were! 

The milk and cookies were served to us for breakfast. The 'roast' dinner was hilarious too. We had roast lamb but it was served with rice, various stir fried veggies as well as just some random Chinese dishes. But my mum had bought various frozen western foods as well like yorkshire puddings, roast carrots and parsnips, some peas and she made some gravy. So it was like a weird Chinese-English fusion cuisine.

And we weren't upset about the lack of presents, we got red envelopes of money instead which is what we usually got on Christmas.

We didn't really attempt it again after that. We kept the tree though and decorated it each year. "

"Drink minimum of 2L of water per day. I fill up my nalgene once in the morning, make sure it's empty by lunch time, fill it up again in the afternoon, make sure it's empty by bed. It makes me feel good, it makes my skin look good, and when I'm feeling anxious watching the water level go down reminds me that I'm doing something tangible for myself and my health. "
"I think part of the problem that hasn't been mentioned is that a lot of people hate child support and see it as 'women getting money from hard working men.'  I encourage anyone outraged by paying child support to get a good lawyer, clean up their life (if necessary) and seek full custody.  The answer to that is always 'The courts are biased against men, why even try?'  

If the mothers are with their children's father and not working full time, they are again viewed as leeches on men, as though raising children isn't hard work and high quality childcare isn't outrageously expensive.  

Reddit has twisted the narrative so that mothers have all the power and fathers have none.  It's the anger of men who want to have sex and father children without personal consequences/responsibility."
"We were in Vegas for a fun trip about 9 months after we met. Drunk me said, “We should probably get married while we’re here, eh?” Drunk him said, “Yeah!”

Yup, we are and we did. "
"I am a librarian, most of my friends are librarians...I don't read a lot, I hate tea and I would rather be set on fire than wear a cardigan.

"A couple of years ago I noticed that there was a large amount of blood in my urine. I’ve had UTI’s in the past, but this was nothing like that because I wasn’t experiencing any pain at all and it was a lot of blood. I decided to go to the local urgent care where they had tested me for a UTI, the test came back negative. She gave me antibiotics just in case it was an infection but told me that she would recommend getting a CT scan to rule out small kidney stones. Since I wasn’t in any pain I decided to give the antibiotics a shot but the blood was not going away in fact it was getting worse. I went to the emergency room where they again tested me for a UTI which again came back negative. I told the ER doctor what the urgent care doctor said and she actually laughed out loud and said that was ridiculous there was no way it was kidney stones. She told me the test was just wrong and I just needed to keep taking the antibiotics. I told her I had a feeling it was something more than that and I asked if I could have a CT scan for just a peace of mind. She
told me no that was crazy I didn’t need a scan and since I was 25 years old I needed to be thinking about how the radiation may affect my ability to have children. The whole conversation was mind blowing but I practically begged her to give me a scan and she finally agreed. She was right it wasn’t kidney stones, it was a tumor that turned out to be cancer."
"Yesterday I had my first suicidal episode in years. I'm in college studying engineering and it's more awful that I can possibly describe. 
Yesterday I had two horrible exams and I walked out and I was finally done. I checked out and started thinking about ways to kill myself because I was convinced there was no other way. 

Even though my soul had gone into full shutdown, I still had enough sense to pick up the phone and call my boyfriend, the first person I could think of. I tell him I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore and I can't keep suffering. He keeps talking to me, trying to talk me down, and nothing works until he finally says ""I bought your birthday present today. I want to give it to you,"" I can hear tears in his voice. 

A small part of me wakes up and all I can say into the phone is ""I don't know what I want, I just know that I don't want to hurt anymore. The way I see it is I have two options: drop out or commit suicide."" 

All of a sudden, a girl is standing next to me and asks me if I'm okay. I put the phone down and tell her that I'm fine, just overwhelmed. She gives me an extremely empathetic look and asks me to go to the student center and just talk for a while, maybe get food. I tell my boyfriend someone wants to talk to me, and he says he's on his way to campus.

I walk with this stranger and just sit down at a table. She just talks to me. She tells me about herself, about school and how much she hates it, and I just listen. She and I talk for almost a half hour. She makes me laugh a bit, she gives me her phone number and tells me to call if I ever need anything. I'm still out of it, but I'm amazed at her kindness.

Statistics show that people are only really suicidal for a very short time, and if they get intervention in that moment, they don't usually relapse. Last night I learned the true capacity for human empathy because a complete stranger heard me say suicide and came to help. I'm grateful to her for listening to what I said and for protecting me from myself. She, along with my boyfriend, saved my life. She didn't even know me but she didn't hesitate to help. I hope I can pay her kindness forward someday, since I survived the night. "
TIL no one on reddit has been one but we know someone who was.

"Freshers' week at uni. First night I'm out I see the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen in my life. She's tall, exotic in a way I can't quite place (I'd later learn she was Egyptian), a little bigger but I'm into that, no one's paying attention to her so I introduce myself. We do the usual dance of ""am I just complimenting you because we're both girls and that's what we do or is this *gay*?""

Eventually we go out for a smoke and I think fuck it, yolo so I lean in and kiss her. She doesn't even finish her fag before dragging me off to her room. I spent the night between her legs and it was glorious, electric. Unlike anything I'd experienced before. I could have died there and been happy. Her body was akin to the manna god gave my ancestors, I'm sure of it. 

The next morning we had breakfast and I wrote down my number for her, and she promised she'd ring me. Only she didn't and months of torment followed. I'm not sure why I didn't just go by her college or something but I was like, 18 and a little naive and dramatic so. 

Maybe a year later I ran into her again and she nearly started crying and said she'd lost the paper with my number, and she didn't know which college I was in and she'd never seen me around, and she'd been so desperate to find me but hadn't had any luck because we hadn't even exchanged surnames.

Long story short, we dated for a few years after and it was an excellent relationship. The breakup was rough but I still think of her fondly."
"In grade eight I was researching topics for a school essay. One of the topics was depression and anxiety so I had a look at the available resources.

"I knew in the beginning that he had some character traits that were important to me--he was kind, patient, forgiving, generous--but I thought his love was just another thing on top of that. Over the years, I started to see that the love was inside those virtues, not on the outside of them if that makes sense; that being a loving person meant being those things, everyday, and that if I could trust his character I could trust his love for me too. So I think I value his character more now than I did then, because I understand it in a more holistic way.  "

This makes me so fucking angry. Fuck that doctor
"I’m going to have pets. All the time. Animals are the thing that is at the center of all I do. They are beautiful and deserve all the good  and attention, and I want to be around them as much as possible."
"Men’s shirts, short skirts. "
"I’ve been vegan for almost three years because of a dumb competition with my sister. Started cause I’m petty, stayed for the animals."
By not dating
"Buy clothes pre-owned on eBay/poshmark/TheRealReal. I guess it’s more ethical consumerism or something, but I fucking love getting a good deal, and getting to wear nice clothes for less than other people pay for them. "
"I recently slept with someone who was in her early thirties, and when she found out how old I was a little afterwards she sort of went ghost white and had that “I’ve made a huge mistake” face on. So yeah, it’s probably not the most appealing thing in the world. 


**edit**: I'd do it again in a heart beat though. So for the apparently 2% of you that's alright with it, hit me up on my pager and I'll get back to you 😎👉👉"
"The last time I actually played my violin with feeling, I finished the Bruch concerto, walked off stage, and asked my mom to drive me to the hospital so I could commit myself.  Being in that psych ward in that small rural Midwest hospital, far from home, it still feels like more of a dream.  I spent a lot of time talking to a man who had slit his own throat while high.  What a weird life he seemed to have, compared to my sheltered, educated, safe one.  Seeing him so determined to live was a game changer for my whole view of reality."
"I'm a male and I have a sugar mommy does that count? Anyway I've been tutoring this girl for physics and I'm doing it for free but she keeps buying me food and books, and it's not cheap either and I feel like I'm in heaven.  "
"Grew up in poverty in the Southern US. I can remember multiple times as a kid when our refrigerator would break down, or a neighbor's would, and we *threw parties*.

Because calling a repair service wasn't thought of as an option, and if you couldn't fix it yourself you knew it'd be a while before you got a replacement. So you call up your nearest neighbors and start cooking everything that's going to go bad otherwise.

I didn't realize this wasn't normal for everyone until I was in college. Mentioned it to my roommate and she was baffled as to why we didn't call a professional to fix our appliances when they broke."
No. Even the idea is gross. They are like children to me.
I wouldn’t care. I think it’s kinda cute. It’s better than sitting in front of the tv doing nothing 
"My mom doesn’t believe in adoption and thinks it is “disgusting” that someone would give up their child. I was appalled and tried to explain that in most cases they don’t WANT to give up their child, it’s a heartbreaking and selfless decision that they are making when they know they can’t adequately provide for their child and want to give them a better life. She said, “Well that’s stupid. Once the baby comes you just figure it out.” Ah yes, everyone knows that life suddenly becomes much simpler when a child is born. "
"-Brush and floss your teeth every day.  Oral care is super important;  my husband had to have a tooth pulled and it's a miserable thing.  Not to mention the fact that oral health is directly linked to heart health.

-Start building the habits that you want for the rest of your life *now*.   In your 20s you have a lot more energy, and it's a lot less painful to change/heal yourself, than 10, 20, 30 years from now.  Go to yoga, go to therapy, find out new ways of thinking, change your mind, learn new things.

-Ultimately, you are the only one that can meet your needs completely.  Don't wait for someone to come along and help you.  Go out and FIND help.  Be the person you need.  Related to this:  Learn how to research so you can find the answers to the questions that you have.  Don't just ask the question and wait for someone to find an answer for you. 

-Remember your accomplishments. They don't have to be big.  In my 20s (due to my depression and ADHD) my accomplishments were often ""I got out of bed and showered today.""

-Strive for your next goal....and remember it's a marathon, not a sprint.   I spent 7 years going to college, 5 at a community college, 2 at UCLA.  You have to learn to enjoy the times where you're just putting in the miles, because sometimes the goal is years away.  **edit: To add to this:  Make sure you have at least one major goal that's 100% attainable if you put in the effort. I knew if I just followed the steps at school, I would graduate.  This was a HUGE boost to my self esteem.  Some goals are NOT that certain, and while they are good (and when they succeed are often times more rewarding), they aren't assured.  Good examples of these goals are ones that rely on other people--goals such as raising a child well, or helping another person through hard times. "
"I would go for a mojito, a mint julep or a margarita (over ice, not frozen). All delicious and not too overwhelming. 


And you can always ask the bartender what they recommend for a novice drinker on their 21st birthday. You might even get a free drink out if it. 


Happy birthday! Hope you have fun!"
"My parents have always been my best friends. I never went through a rebellious teen phase, and I’ve had maybe a handful of fights with my mom in my entire life and I’ve literally never had fights with my dad. I always felt supported and safe and loved and my parents were always open minded and understanding, even through my depression and figuring out my sexuality and my eating disorder and so much more. My mom is loud and crazy and fun and my dad is the nicest, funniest, and most patient person you will ever meet in your entire life. I am so blessed, and when I see people fighting with their parents or talking about their shitty childhoods, I realize all over again how truly lucky I am. I dealt with my own trials and struggles, but my parents were always a positive influence on my life."
I've never seen a woman go off about a man holding open a door.
"I had a really old man tell me I had a beautiful smile. He said I smiled like I meant it and it made him and his wife smile when they saw me smiling.
Whenever I feel ugly I look in the mirror and smile like I mean it."
"As an Australian, I cannot STAND vegemite. "
"I'm always baffled by open toe boots. If I'm wearing boots, it's probably too cold for an open toed shoe. If I want an open toed shoe, it's probably too warm for me to wear boots."
"I'm a black guy, and I just loved all the small annoyances that guy went through. It's always nice to really know other people go through the same shit. I remember one guy told me I should start going to the gym, cause because of my genetics I'd be a beast, and I just looked at him like the main character does a lot. 

I'd be interested to hear from any black women if they get that in terms of presumed athleticism? For me everyday it's people touching my hair, people acting ""street"" around me, and that. I think the film captures that awkward position that you're often put well. 

I live in the UK just for context, I think people often ignore there are black people outside the US in this kind of conversation - often it's Europeans saying to pretend there's no issues like this at all. "
"ADHD, especially in women, doesn't mean you're bouncing off the walls or jumping from one thought to the other with no control. It *can*, but it doesn't manifest that way often. 

A common symptom of ADHD in women (especially when coupled with anxiety) is an inability to act or focus on a task because you know you can't do it perfectly and if you can't do it perfectly you shouldn't do it at all. "
"I had a dentist say I had 14 cavities and start drilling into my teeth and filling a few without even telling my mom anything. 

I've only had maybe two small cavities my whole life, so to say I had 14 my mom didn't believe a thing. I went to another dentist not too long after and she was really mad because the previous dentist was known for doing unnecessary work and I had no cavities at all (meaning the ones they ""filled"" were most likely nonexistent as well). 

To make it worse all the teeth they worked on are now really sensitive and one of them even had a giant chunk chip off in the middle of class, I literally had to spit out a giant chunk of my molar in the middle of taking a test"
"A lot of people have touched on misogyny and childfreeness on reddit, but I think it's also important to consider the impact of agism and it's intersection with misogyny. Older people are less important/more boring that young people in our society. Especially women because once they ""lose their looks"" they also lose their value (to reddit and society). Basically, if reddit doesn't want to fuck a girl, she's not worthwhile (notice how this is sounding really similar to redpill ideology?). You can see this to a less extreme extent in society at large in the way that middle aged women are just ignored; like how we have old lead actors paired with young actresses. So basically moms are the ultimate target of sexism on reddit - they're women, they have kids (double whammy if they're stay at home moms so they ""free-load""), and they're old and not sexy."
"I play games for story but apparently that makes me a filthy casual. So be it. If I can figure out how to godmode a game, I'll do it. "
"No. I'm 28 and just no no no.

For one, they *look* young as hell. For two, they ARE young as hell and probably have no idea what they're doing.

Sex wasn't fun when I was 18-22 and banging 18-22 aged dudes. Why would I go back to that again?"
"I like that it is socially acceptable for me to be both feminine and masculine, where it isn't as socially acceptable for men to showcase feminine traits. No one seems to care when I'm in a t-shirt and jeans or if I'm wearing a dress. No one cares if I lift weights one day and cry to a rom-com the next. "
"Just today, we took my male cat to the vet for a second time this month for a urethral blockage. I was fired at the end of December and my husband was laid off about a week ago, so both of these vet trips have been expensive. Sitting in the lobby of the animal hospital today, the woman who had come in behind us came over to talk to me about my poor sick kitty and my voice broke telling her about just how bad the timing is. She said wait here and went and got a $100 from her car and gave it to me and hugged me and said she'd pray for my cat. I'm not religious, and tbh we can pay the bill just fine (no, she wouldn't let me give it back) but it was just such a wonderful and perfect thing to do and she made me feel so loved. So thank you, Robin. I'll be paying your kindness forward some day when I'm back on my feet.

*Update* He's home, safe &amp; sound for now! Thanks for the well wishes everyone! Hopefully this is the last time this happens! (The full month of steroids should help!)"

"Ugh god, this is me. There’s all this weird pressure to make it your whole life. To be so passionate, always working on your app or a new side project, poring over articles and blogs on the newest tech. It’s like, seriously? 40 hours a week isn’t enough? I’m a whole person, not a robot. I want to be well-rounded. Why should that count against me?"
I never knit a gauge swatch.
"I got accidentally knocked up at age 19 and we got married a little while after baby was born. He was not that young though, he was already established in his career, he's older than me. Honestly I don't know for sure why it worked, we weren't even really in love when we were hooking up, it's something that developed throughout the pregnancy. 20ish years later we're perfectly happy , I mean I wouldn't change a thing."
"Not eat, but I drink fancy tea instead of alcohol when I want to treat myself."
"Menstrual problems. I hear so many people talk about their problems with their period and I’m like — nope, never had that. My periods have always been pretty regular, average flow, a reasonable length, and I have no major symptoms. 

I used to occasionally get mild cramps, but I haven’t even had any cramps for years. The worst  I ever got was really swollen and painful boobs right before my period, but that’s also largely gone away in recent years. 

Ever since I switched to a cup nearly a decade ago, I don’t even remember I’m on my period when I have it. It’s a non-experience, almost.

So, compared to the pain and difficulties so many people have — yeah, I’m grateful. "

"Statistically speaking, marrying over the age of 25 to a partner less than 9 years older than you and less than 2 years younger than you, with both of you having a college education makes you least likely to divorce.

Ideally I would say younger than 30 though, if you want to have kids (especially more than one) but if you don't want to have kids this doesn't matter much."
"My husband and I have been best friends since we were 9. We moved out of state together at 18 for me to go to school, and got married at 20. We just had our first kid at 30. Honestly, it's like marriage on easy mode. We never had to learn to accommodate one another or meet our in-laws for the first time or merge two sets of dishes. My husband is incredible; he's kind, compassionate, strong, handsome, and such a good teammate. He's still my best friend and I've loved him more every day for the past twenty years.

The only backlash we got was from strangers and people who didn't know us well telling us we were going to ruin our lives. They were wrong, obviously. "
"I started keeping a journal when I was 9 (I'm now 30), in it are a few harrowing entries from child-me describing depression without knowing what it was. I found/reread it when I was probably 24, it was pretty shocking to realize it had been in me for that long. I certainly remember being ill in my teens, but at 9? Crazy.

I'm not 100% (by any means) but I have definitely developed coping skills, especially throughout my 20s. "

"I used to do that too, until I read one of those donation boxes more closely, and after some surreptitious googling, realised it was a donation box for a pro-Erdogan organisation. 

I started paying closer attention to these boxes and realised that most of the independent stores in my area have donation boxes for religious organisations that I'm fairly iffy about supporting. "

"- If someone tells you they're a dog, believe them. If someone shows you they're an ass, move on. It's not your responsibility to change or save anyone but yourself!!!  Again - he or she is NOT your responsibility! 
- Don't wait for anyone or anything to fix or rescue you either! Step up and take responsibility for yourself - emotionally, financially, etc.  
- Figure out what your personal ""blind spots"" are and how they're impacting your life. We all have those issues or habits that are not helping us and/or negatively impacting our quality of life. What things keep happening in your life? What mistakes do you make? What ""did you not see coming"" yet again? What do you need to do to better understand what's really happening in order to make better choices for yourself?
- Live within your means! Do not rack up any more debt than you absolutely have to! And be honest about needs vs. wants. Don't sell out your future self because getting out from under debt is god awful hard and takes away a lot of choices for a long time. 
- Read a book like Suze Ormon's ""9 Steps to Financial Freedom"" to educate yourself about basic financial matters. Pay attention to the point about compounding and building a savings account! Putting money aside can be hard but this would be one thing I would definitely do different if I could. PAY YOURSELF FIRST! It's amazing how much it can add up and it's a literal gift to your future self. 
- Be thoughtful about who you choose to share yourself with, both emotionally and physically. Don't mistake physical intimacy for emotional closeness or caring. 
- Travel provides an incredible education and is food for the soul. Being exposed to different people, cultures, food, beliefs, etc. helps us better understand on so many different levels and gives us more information from which to make informed choices/beliefs. 
- Pay attention to what's going on in the world outside of your usual social circle. Too often we limit our exposure to others that think just like us IRL and online. This may be more comfortable but can hamper our ability to grown and learn; to expand our knowledge and understanding of others; to empathize and connect with others. It sets up and reinforces an ""us vs. them"" mentality - the exact thing that is tearing apart our country. You don't have to agree with everyone but I'd ask that you try to understand the other point of view and why someone might think differently than you.  
- Be willing to be uncomfortable sometimes because sometimes that's the only way we as individuals and as a society can move forward. Be willing to keep an open mind and really listen to others, especially those with whom you don't agree or are the underdogs.  
- Be kind. To yourself and others. 
- Learn how to advocate for yourself and how to handle confrontation. Be okay with someone being unhappy or angry with you. 
- At work, negotiate and ask for what you're worth. Too often we take what's offered and get the short end of the stick. We want to be wanted or needed and companies take advantage of that. They aren't going to just give it to you because you work hard or are loyal - you've got to advocate for yourself and understand how the game works. 
- Sunscreen. Sunscreen. Sunscreen."
"They have *got* to be someone you trust to care for you when you are physically disgusting. Like, puking your guts up, sweaty, smelling like poop, half dead, can't walk, crying, snotty... Yeah, all at the same time. They have got to be someone you trust with your life when every part of who you are is weak and awful. 

On the reverse- when they're broken to bits and physically revolting, you need to be someone to them who smiles, gets a towel, and cleans them up and puts them to bed with tenderness and love. 

Your life is a *long* time. You are gonna see some shit, if you stick with another human for a few decades. You need to be ready to handle that and know they can handle it too. "
"I just started using sheet masks and turned the wait time into a mini spa experience. I light a candle next to my bed, snuggle in with a book and read for about 15 minutes. It’s simple but having that quiet time a few days a week has done wonders for not only my skin, but also my peace of mind. 

Also, shower beer. "

"Anecdotal evidence is the most annoying. My boyfriend's brother arranged an ""intervention"" with my boyfriend to chastise him for being friends with his ex on Facebook. His reasoning was, ""My girlfriend would be really mad about that, and all women react based on emotion, and ashmoe32 is a woman so you better delete your ex."" 

Hmmmm, yes, please tell me more about how one woman's reaction speaks for all of us."
"I've done a 180 in two years. My husband left me, and as a sahm for 10 years, I had to get ready quick because I was dependant on his income. He couldn't really help much and I didn't want his money anyways being split between two homes now. Custody was 50/50. 

I got a job, I excelled and was promoted so fast that I was making more than him in a few months. Got my own place with MY MONEY, I lost over 80 lbs, I got a shrink and found out I was bipolar so my meds are working so well. 

I got my dental work done, I got a nice haircut and look fantastic, and was able to pay for everything while taking a mere 200 in cash and one months rent and utilities from him for the old place. 

I never filed for anything, no benefits, no alimony, nothing. 

I bought a nice car, pay for a nice place, and am moving up to a better position with a better company. I'm so proud of myself because when we were together I was so fucking depressed, fat, and agoraphobic with social anxiety. I'm way different now. 

We got back together but it took two years to get there and we are better than ever, but I will never put off my future for a man again. 

Kids are happy, we are happy, but I'm making goddamned sure if it ends I have all means to take care of business myself with no help. 

If you saw me two years ago, I was just kinda sad. Amazing how things can change :)"
"Same snarky sense of humor. Is she self-aware, a giver but not a pushover? Generally happy. Has her own interests but shares some of mine, too. Understands my flaws and fears but doesn't hold them against me. "

"For example, when I was maybe 14 or so I had worries that my boyfriend was cheating on me. I created a fake screen name and talked/flirted with him and eventually asked if he had a girlfriend, he said no and I was really upset. 

He was an asshole and cheating on me, but the fact that I thought this was a totally acceptable way to address the situation is so uncomfortable to reflect on. "
"Will Smith. I’m a huge hip hop fan, have been for twenty years. I have thousands of hip hop cds. I was a dj for 10 years. I can go in depth on 90s era New York rap for hours. 

Still, Will Smith is one of my all time favourite rappers. I know he’s corny and cheese, but so fucking what. The dude produced legit classics in the late 80s and early 90s. Summertime is a bonafide banger no matter what you think of his other stuff. Girls Ain’t Nothin But Trooble is legit hilarious to this day, and has a fucking shiver rap!Dude has so much creativity and he clearly LOVES rap. He LOVES the culture. And he has FUN. And fuck you if  Getting Jiggy With It  doesn’t make you happy and smile! "
"I had a doctor tell me that my daughter's persistent fever and screaming was just a cold even though she had zero other symptoms. I insisted they check for a UTI because my older daughter has kidney problems that cause UTIs and she was acting exactly the same as when we had gone through it before. The doctor basically said he would do it but it would be putting her through unnecessary pain for nothing. 

Yeah, she had a UTI and if I wouldn't have caught it so early she would have had to be hospitalized. Turns out she has the same thing as my older daughter and because I caught it so quick we saved her a lot of extra trauma. Kidney Reflux sucks ass."
see-through shoes...made of plastic.
"Honestly, probably not. They all look like babies to me. I realize that at 18 they're legal adults, but the older I get the harder I have looking at an 18 year old and not seeing someone who's 14. And they all seem to act like they're 12 to boot. Definitely not physically or emotionally attracted to men that young."
"Chris (a black man) is getting a tour of his (white) girlfriend Rose's parents' house from her dad. Chris and her dad pass by two black people who work for the family, Chris obviously notices it and Rose's dad comments that it looks bad to be a white family with black servants, but that he'd ""vote for Obama a third time if he could"". 

I laughed pretty hard in the theater because my (white) FIL *loves* President Obama and has said the same thing on multiple occasions. Though I don't think he was saying it to make me think he's cool with black people, he just really loves Obama. "
"I worked in the construction business.  50% of  men treated me normal.  The other half either treated me like their teenage daughter, a sex object or like I was a clueless idiot.

**Mental: Keeping a daily gratitude journal.**

I write down at least one thing every single day no matter how small that makes me smile/laugh/happy. Sometimes I draw or take pictures of it instead. 

**Skincare: Wear sunscreen on all exposed skin every day without fail (yes even of there is ""no sun"").**

The only thing that actually prevents signs of ageing. More importantly protects you from skin cancer. I always opt for Japanese or Korean sunscreens that have a minimum of SPF 50. I find them to be far more cosmetically elegant than the majority of their Western counterparts. 

**Physical: Lifting &amp; Strength Training**

Weight lifting (both free weights &amp; body weights) is the best thing I have ever done for myself. It's helped me in so many ways both physically &amp; mentally. Deadlifting is probably my favourite thing ever. It honestly makes me feel invincible.

"There is something so wholesome and precious that your mom tried these crazy western traditions that she didn't understand fully for the kids, and that it became your own Chinese western Christmas instead. This is my favourite story. 😊"
"I was best friends with someone for over ten years. The friendship survived two cross country moves (one by each of us,) until we finally ended up back in our home city again. Unfortunately when we reconnected, we had obviously grown apart. She was interested in the house, the car, the kids, and marriage. I have interest in none of those things in the foreseeable future. When we hung out, it was mostly talking about past memories and the good old days. I realized we had nothing new to talk about anymore. We stopped hanging out, and eventually stopped texting as well. I wish her happiness, but it's not fair to waste my time or her's on a friendship that isn't going anywhere, and no longer offers anything besides reflection on the good old days. I miss having a best friend, especially a female one, but that's life."
"It isn't just reddit.

I like kids, but knew early on I never wanted to be a parent.

I got on the Internet in the early 90s where your choices for outlets for conversations were either email lists or Usenet groups.    There were childfree forums via those technologies. 

The childfree spaces were flat out *nasty* and *negative* even back then.  Every century or so I will poked my head into childfree spaces in evolving ""forum"" technology ( weboards, facebook, reddit ) only to find the same nasty bitterness right away.

Worse, at least on reddit,  MGTOW types seem to be  finding their way into the childfree groups to vent their spleens.  I guess venting their spleens in their own groups and trolling the groups of others wasn't enough, so they decided to pile on with people spewing on women for reasons other than MGTOW reasons ( being mothers )."
"Reddit is typically young and has all these Subreddits which can validate people's views in an echo chamber until it seems normal.  So pretty much every extreme view can find purchase here.  And since those people are not confined to that echo chamber, hey can get wound up until thinking that view is normal and then interact with the general population believing everyone thinks similarly."

"First off, he is a minute younger than me and a foot taller. It's way unfair. I was taller than him all throughout middle school and then he shot up like a weed.

My experience is probably very different from most twins. I'm part of a fraternal boy/girl pair. My twin brother was deprived of oxygen in the womb, resulting in some mental disabilities. 

He is high functioning in that he is mostly self sufficient and has a job, but still requires some care, as he can't drive. I grew up feeling more like a guardian than a sibling. I used to get in a lot of fights in elementary school because he was bullied. Luckily everyone started being nicer to him by middle school. When we turned 18, my parents and I went to the court house to get guardianship over him so we could make medical/legal decisions for him. I worry about him a lot. 

He honestly frustrates me more than almost anyone else. He's selfish in a lot of ways that I know he can't help. Growing up, even though we were both ""the baby"", he got a lot more attention and care than I did. I knew he needed it, and it didn't usually bug me, but it forced me to be ""grown up"" from a much earlier age. He does lots of careless things without thinking, like turning off a timer I have to use the microwave, or getting mad when I make dinner instead of us going out to eat like he wanted. 

He's also thoughtful in ways I don't anticipate. He got me a card at work after hearing me crying about a boy one night. He always puts up the dishes and takes out the trash. He tries to be nice to my dogs, but usually just ignores them. (They ignore him, too, mostly. It works out.)

It's a hard situation. I don't always like him. Sometimes he makes it really, really hard to like him. But I always love him. I think I would be a very different person if I didn't grow up with him."

"I was having some debate with a red piller who insisted that women preferred men significantly older than them, I pulled out a bunch of legitimate sources showing women on average prefer men close to their own age or a *few* years older.

"Juicy couture tracksuits. Having juicy couture or princess,etc. Emblazoned across your ass was all the rage. I am gonna be so salty if this comes back in style.  

Ed hardy shirts. They usually have axe body spray included in the package."

"I find a morning star is better, it's still a good blunt weapon like a club but the spikes make it a lot more effective."
It's genetic. And it's not always as great as you might think. Having naturally shiny hair usually means it's also more difficult to control oiliness. 
I started dating somebody who valued me and let me know how much I meant to them instead of somebody who kept me guessing and desperately avoided commitment.
"Plants and pets, I will have too many plants and I will have too many pets. They will eat before me and the plants will drink water before me."
"I was a sugar baby for a little while. I was missing sex in my life and thought hey, this would be a good way to fill that hole ;) 

Anyway, it’s a lot like dating. You want to make sure you click with the person and they aren’t crazy. The amount of dates I went on was staggering, probably in the ball park of 20-30. For the most part, they were all decent humans. 95% of them were married and also looking because of a dead bedroom. The ones I went on dates with had had other sugar babies (some at the same time, others in the past). The first date (for me) was always platonic and usually at a nice restaurant for lunch. 

One creepy guy showed me a picture of his dog and had to scroll through a lot of photos of girls to get there. Then he took a picture of me eating, but he forgot to turn his volume down so I heard the camera noise on his phone. I quickly noped the fuck out of that one.

The worst guy involved a situation where we were walking in a park after lunch. He proceeded to push me against a fence, kiss me, and try to finger me. Just because I was looking for sex didn’t mean I was looking to be violated. I hate to think about the other women that this has been okay and if it went further. 

A couple of the guys I started an arrangement with just to see how we’d interact in the bedroom. I’m a dominatrix in my kinks, so sex or lack there of is completely at my discretion and they consented to this. The guys were always respectful towards me, they took me to kink stores and I picked out new equipment, went on nice dinners, bought me way too expensive shoes, some really great skincare, and yes cash for my time as well. 

Most of them wanted someone to talk to and let their kinks fly free in a safe space. A lot of the time they wanted to live vicariously through my sexual freedom and ability to go to kink events. I still randomly talk to a few of them every once in awhile. But by far, my favorite was an insanely handsome vanilla man with an open mind. 

U/sugarsatisfaction has a lot of good points about safety and what you want to look for. If you’re seriously considering this, please do your research on it. It is not “easy” money and it will take awhile to find someone that meets your needs. It also takes a huge emotional toll if you are in it for necessity."
"When I was ten years old, my mom got really mad at us kids for something I can't remember and was screaming and tearing up the house. She had a tendency to over-dramatize things and just say things like ""I'm just going to leave and disappear and someone will appreciate me!"". Nobody I had known besides my uncle had died at that point - and he died ""in his sleep"" (I found out later it was epileptic seizures that ultimately lead him to block his airway with his tongue). I had no concept of why anyone would die other than old age or getting sick.

Anyways, my mom immediately went for a bath after she yelled at us, and I remember thinking the water was running too long. My first thought was she was trying to commit suicide by drowning herself in the bath tub. So after a lot of banging and screaming, I picked the lock to the bathroom door ad swung it open to find my mom just having a normal bath. She got even more mad at me and I was punished for invading her privacy.

I just remembered this a few days ago and wonder why the hell eight year old me thought that people drown themselves in bath tubs when I wouldn't learn about suicide until well into my teens."
Kindness. I once accepted a guy who was inherently unkind being in my life for far too long. Never again. 
"I buy rainforest safe, fair trade coffee because it tastes better "
"Yes.

It's my kink. My fiance is much younger than me. 

His kink is older women. We are also both childfree, have similar life goals, extremely similar senses of humor. He is a bit mature for his age, I am a bit immature for mine. We meet in the middle and it works.

And oh wow, we're both into ageplay and other taboo kinks too. We're both sexual degenerates and I love him to fucking itty bits. "
"I explained to my boyfriend that I'm still processing a lot of shit, and that sometimes, I'm going to say, ""I just need a day, and it's not about you, and it's not that you did anything wrong, it's just that I need some time to meditate, take a bath, write in my journal, sit under some headphones with a candle burning, take a nap, something, and I don't want to talk to anyone while I'm doing it.""

Once he understood that when I say, ""I need Me Time,"" I don't mean that he's messed up or I'm angry with him or that we're breaking up or anything, it's purely just that I need some time to focus on myself, everything was okay. I've explained that I don't ever want to be the person who takes out my other stresses on him, and I never want to make him pay for what I've endured with other people, and so sometimes, I just need time for myself, and he understands that and it has made us a lot better."
"Harem pants - looks like a soiled diaper

"I was walking down some stairs and heading towards a crosswalk when I randomly remembered something awkward from like 10 years ago and groaned in a ""oh my god that was terrible I can't believe I did that"" way.

Unknown to me, across the crosswalk was a girl I knew-and she was in my middle distance. So to her it seemed like I stopped going down the stairs, made eye contact and then loudly moaned across the street at her.

We did not make eye contact when we crossed the cross walk, and never spoke again."
"As a feminist - that I love watching *The Bachelor.*

Nothing beats having a delicious cup of coffee knowing you’re the only person awake and don’t have to deal with anybody’s bullshit for at least another hour.
"Not married but together almost 13 years. 

I just wish I had noticed that he is so emotionally unattached. I want to talk about my day and I want to share every thing with him. I want to talk about the future and the now. My dreams and my fears. I want to talk about how boring that book was or how I binge watched a show. I want to travel with him and have that comfortable silence as well. I want to talk about the dumb girl I saw at the store or the girl I saw get flowers at work because her life has been rough the last week. 

Just anything and everything. Instead, I'm practically married to a wall. 

In my opinion, looks will change. You'll get older, fatter, skinnier, balder, whatever. So find someone you won't be bored with at the end of the day when it's just the two of you. "

"1. Get the fuck off social media.

2. Begin paying special attention to the good stories and scenes, in your own life and in the news.

3. Become the change you want to see. Hold doors open, pick up trash when you see it, smile and make eye contact with people.

4. Flip every bad encounter to see the other side. Dude was an asshole to you on the bus? Wonder what's happened to him to make him that way. Ask yourself what you can do to change things."
"Not that this applies to all people, but I find that mothers who really identify as being a mom have negative vibes towards people without kids.


They behave as if those without kids are completely inexperienced in life and therefore don't have valid opinions.  'You think your tired?  Try have kids, then you will know what tired it.""  ""As a mom.... "" are both things I hear regularly from mothers.  

Also, those mothers tend to put down the accomplishments of others, saying that they are on the easy path since they don't have kids.  I am back in school now, and I get AMAZING grades because I work my ass off.  Soo many of the mothers in the class put down my grades, and of others, because we 'have it easy'.  No, I don't have it easy, you have bad time management and signed up for too much responsibilities  thats why your grades are shit.


Otherwise, I love women who have their own identities that just happen to be mothers.  The type that don't mention their kids all the time as an excuse.  The type that don't put others down for not having kids."
Never.
"I struggled with anorexia for several years. While I can't speak for everybody, I know that for a large number of us, it has nothing to do with wanting to look like what we see on TV or in magazines, or with trying to strive for some ideal image of beauty. It's a maladaptive coping mechanism, a way to feel like you're in control of something. I know a lot of sufferers also use it as a form of self-punishment. Even if you'd locked me in a room from birth with no exposure to media images, I probably still would have developed anorexia.

It honestly kind of makes me sick that so often anorexia gets reduced to ""a bunch of girls wanting to look like what they see on TV."" Even for the folks whose disorders are negatively affected by media images, that's such a gross oversimplification and such a small facet of the anorexia monster. I'm so jaded by anti-anorexia campaigns that focus solely on *~the media~*"

"Oh boy. And Reddit is just so ridiculous when it comes to anything regarding family law. Being a lawyer and having studied family law specifically, it is so frustrating to see uniformed misogynist  trying to weaponize issues of family law. They often spout questionable anecdotes about how they or someone they know get railroaded. 

The history of family law in the US, in reality, has mainly been tilted against women. Before the “tender years presumption” (when moms were defaulted by the courts as the caretaker based on gender stereotypes), moms had NO RIGHTS to their children in the rare event of separation or divorce. The “tender year’s presumption” saddled mother’s with all the responsibility of caring for children in a system where there was very little social support or child support enforcement. Now courts go *overboard* in my opinion with the 50/50 presumption, and not always taking into account how difficult it can be for kids to constantly move around. Child support is strictly regulated by statutory formulas to assure the parent who is taking primary care of the child is reimbursed. 

Most of the time, divorce, separation, and child custody are a matter of private negotiation between two parties who have their own unique situations. The settlement is merely signed off on by the court, so the whole conversation about “armies of biased judges out of controlled,” is just bunk. 

The sad thing is, the main reasons that most single dads aren’t involved with their kids is they are either (1) disinterested; (2) distracted by a new family; or (3) under the incorrect and tragic notion that dads don’t matter. 

When it comes to child support, once the state takes over, the law prevents parents from having any say. The state does not want to support single parents, and will do whatever it takes to make sure children are financially supported. The main thing I see, is the person who doesn’t take care of the child most of the time (usually the dad) doesn’t understand how expensive kids are because they don’t see the maintenance cost of rent, food, clothes, education etc... and how that adds up daily."

"I think the ending worked anyway. My stomach DROPPED when the police lights started flashing, I thought for sure Chris was a dead man. I was so happy when it was Rod.

I watch him play for hours in online casinos. I drive 6 hours to the casinos every couple months and sit with him while he plays all night long. We set aside money every month so he can use it to play and follow his dream of being a professional poker player. I make him cards on birthdays and anniversaries with poker references. I buy him T-shirt’s with poker jokes on them. I don’t necessarily agree with it or enjoy it like he does, but I make room for it in our lives because it makes him happy and gives him passion.

I posted on subs like /r/tumblrinaction a lot, and looking at that sub now, I mostly tend to agree with the people being made fun of more than the people commenting. 


Also I posted a screenshot once to /r/the_donald something I read on Facebook... I hate Trump but I knew they’d love it there and I got like 3,000+ upvotes. I completely did it for the karma."
I have never seen the supposedly widespread trend of fathers being treated as suspicious when they're taking care of their kids at playgrounds and such.

"Not married yet, but:

He was in Spain for study abroad, and I was having a hard time with him being away for so long. We pitched in on tickets so I could come visit. Our second day there, we went to the Prado museum and sort of spontaneously started pretending we didn’t know each other and had just met. After that, he wanted to show me this big, beautiful park there, but my feet were hurting from a new pair of shoes. I asked if we could go the next day and he insisted we go that day, and took my shoes off and gave me his socks to wear instead. Then he put me on his shoulders and carried me to this lovely little water feature within the park. We rented a paddle boat and went out onto the water. It was about 105° that day, and my face was sweating. I had a dry spray deodorant in my bag, and I tried spraying it on my face to see if it would work. 

Turns out, I’d kept my mouth open a little bit as I did it, and it immediately went dry, and there were these little flecks of the spray all over my tongue. It was super uncomfortable and funny and stupid. While I was dealing with that, turned away, he told me he was so glad I was in Spain with him and that he’d had so much fun that day and that he wanted to do things like that for the rest of his life. He pulled out a ring from inside this bag that he’d actually asked me to hold several times that day. It was wonderful and sort of a storybook proposal, minus the sundress and sweaty men’s socks getup and the mouth full of dry spray.

I kissed him and his mouth went dry too :)

"My best friend of more than a decade didn't show up to a show we were supposed to see for her bday, and then I didn't see her again for almost five years. No text, got off of FB, Snapchat, etc. Disappeared. Saw her last night and finally talked to her...

How am I handling it? Well, she had no real explanation for why she left and didn't seem interested in reconnecting. So, after years of worrying and waiting for her to resurface... I'm letting my Rage take the wheel and going with that."

And nsfw, but I just LOVE dick lmao. If I were a dude, I'd totally be gay not just because I loved girly things but because I'd want to be with men still - and in our heteronormative society, that would have made my life harder than just being a straight woman.

"Waxing: we get you’re shy and nervous. I’ve had clients tell me their husbands don’t see them in that bright of light and that close. I also don’t see nor notice as much as their husbands would. I see a job about to be done. It also makes my job sooooooo much harder when you’re not willing to move or pull as I need, resulting in a poor wax that I’m still going to charge you full price for.

For nails: please keep the hands and feet relaxed and stop pulling them back towards you. I spend 8 hours a day bent over and trying to reach further over a table because you won’t give me your hand only makes my back hurt more, and my job more frustrating. I am also likely going to miss spots and I’ll still charge you full price.

For skin treatments or other: it’s ok to fall asleep. In fact we enjoy it too. Talking all day is tough on us and we don’t mind the odd hour of quiet. We can really focus on your treatment. On the flip side, if talking helps you relax, talk away. Please though, try and keep the convo going if you want to talk. I’m trying to multi-task and coming up with conversation is tough to do when I don’t know you. It also makes me think you want me to leave you alone when you don’t respond much so I’ll stay silent, resulting in a client feeling like I didn’t care.

Please inform us if we missed a spot politely. Our job is our passion and we want you satisfied completely. Unless you’re rude about it, it’s never a bother to fix something to your taste. Don’t be mad if we don’t do something to your liking and you didn’t tell us and we charge you full price.

Lastly, have fun! Our clients become our friends and I have many I look forward to seeing every day. Tell us about your promotion, the supper you’re looking forward too, a trip you have planned or the rough day you’re having. It’s about taking care of you!"

"Ugh. Not that long ago, I got beat up after opening my door to someone knocking one morning.  Went to the hospital,one of my thighs was already starting to bruise and I had a lot of swelling in other places, couldn't string words together right, see right out of one eye and felt like my ear was about to explode from pressure.  I was puking from the pain in my ear.  

So Dr comes in, sends me for a cat scan on my head, insists the huge ass bruise on my leg wasn't from just an hour ago because ""they just don't show that fast"" doesn't give me any X-ray's or anything.  I never asked for pain meds either, because I like to be able to feel everything so I know if it's getting better or worse, but I did ask for nausea meds.  The only thing that ever works for me is Promethazine and I can only take half doses or else I get restless legs super bad,but usually hospitals give you zofran first.  So I took the zofran, threw up again, told them it wasn't working- and she gives me more zofran.  Threw up again, she comes in and tells me there's no internal bleeding in my head and I can go home.  Um.  Ok.  But I'm puking from this pain and can't see right and can't even talk normally.. Are you sure? She says yes and sends me home with a prescription for fucking zofran.  

I don't even bother filling it and call my Dr a couple hours later because the pain and nausea were pretty unbearable and could I please just have Promethazine (she knows this is all that works for me). It was a Sunday,which I forgot at the time, so I get a call back from their on call Dr. I tell him what's going on, what the other Dr said and ask him for different nausea meds.  He tells me I need to get to the hospital he's at right now and WTF were they thinking sending me home like that and not checking for internal bleeding anywhere else. So I go and they're much more thorough and document everything. All my bruises were deep deep purple by now and they almost didnt believe me when I told them the other Dr told me my huge thigh bruise wasn't from that day because... Just... Wtf. I never go to that first hospital anymore.  "

"This is so very true of people in general - we really *do* become different people, several times over, if lucky enough to live a long life. Being able to go through that while in a long term committed relationship is difficult, but can also be incredibly rewarding when it works.

However, I also don't think it's necessarily a 'failure' for those that end up changing so much in different directions that they just don't mesh well together anymore. Especially, if you were together from a very young age. You can change in ways you'd never have imagined.

I've seen couple's who are amazing together throughout the different stages of life and the many changes they go through. And I've seen others who are so miserable, trying to stay together because they made a commitment, but it's painfully obvious they have become so different that they just don't work anymore. Some things you can put the time and effort into and it works, other things you can't force it to fit no matter how hard you try. I think the difficulty is knowing which is which.

Especially, because I've now met more than a couple 'couples' who went through seriously rough patches that lasted in terms of years, not weeks or months, but are so incredibly happy together now and so thankful for not giving up on each other. 

The one thing that seems to be key is that *both* people must choose the other over and over again. It's not a one time choice and then you just ride it out. It's active, conscious and continuous choice."

"Got married at 22 (it was considered young at the time), we are celebrating 10 years married this year.
What worked for us was failing. About 5 years in we had a toddler, a ton of debt and were miserable. We both took a step back, I stayed with family, he stayed with friends and we coparented for a year and a half. We spent that entire time in family counseling and learned how to communicate better and built a foundation under us that we didnt have before. After awhile we started dating eachother again while still living separately and it was glorious. We havent been happier  since. that break was exactly what we needed at the time. "

"I feel like every trend in women's casual shirts is to reduce the materials necessary to their absolute minimum.

Grandma gets the biggest scissors at home and cuts an “imaginary cord” between the baby’s legs. Control remote is missing? Must be the domovoy! (house spirit)

Yesterday's massacre of children
"When I was 15, I was best friends with a girl who was very “full on” - she’d write me long letters about how much she valued our friendship, she bought us one of those “Forever Friend” necklace sets where we each got half of a heart pendant, etc etc. Then my Mom got diagnosed with cancer for the second time (I was a toddler when she had it the first time) and I fell to pieces. I turned to my best friend for support and she just ... disappeared from my life, but only after ignoring me for a while and then writing me a letter saying that I had absolutely no right to tell my friends about my Mum’s cancer, that I was selfish in doing so, and that she couldn’t take my Mum’s cancer away. All my friends subsequently disappeared and it wasn’t until a few years later, when I got reacquainted with a couple of them, that I discovered she’d told all of my friends that I was making it up for attention. 

I have absolutely no idea to this day (over 20 years later) why she reacted that way, especially since I’d been there for her throughout her various health issues (she had chronic health problems).  I can’t say I ever really properly dealt with it. It impacted me in two different ways, that still continue to this day - I still struggle massively with confiding in anyone when I’m going through hell (bad) but I also vowed that I’d never let anyone go through something alone (good). 

(My Mom lived, by the way. Despite giving up chemo on my 16th birthday because she couldn’t handle the side effects, radiation was successful and she went into remission seven months after diagnosis and has been cancer free ever since.) "

"In Ontario, it's legal to run around with your breasts out. They argued that since men are allowed to, which shouldn't women be allowed too? But you don't really see it. Been living in Ontario for more than a decade, and I've never seen this happen though.

Edit: When I said running around, I didn't mean physically running. The law would apply to any sort of activity being done in public with your breasts hanging out. "

"Kim Kardashian. 

She's a successful businesswoman. She's extremely charitable (and has been for years, since well before she was a household name). She connects well with her followers. She gives Middle Eastern girls an example of a conventionally beautiful woman who looks like them. She took her show to Armenia to raise awareness of the genocide. She took her show to Skid Row in LA, to show just how devastating the homeless epidemic is, as well as to take away from the glamour of her own life in comparison. She regularly visits the LA Children's Hospital and donates her time and money. She is close with her family. She loves her children and her husband more than anything and she's a good parent. 

But she made a sex tape once and didn't graduate from Yale or something so people think it's okay to shit on her. It pisses me off and I don't even watch the show. "
"Unknowingly, I did everything to hijack it. We were in New York: it was my first time in the US, and he chose Central Park. I had no idea this was in even in the pipeline. We were together for 10 years, 6 long distance, and I juts thought we would be together forever, that was it. 

So, the poor man had researched the most romantic spot he could find for ages. He chose the Shakespeare gardens. So we're in Central Park, and it's mid August, temperature around 38 degrees Celsius( 100 Fahrenheit). 

Despite being from Southern Italy and used to those temperatures, heat just kills me. I had my favourite light dress on, but I was melting. Thus, our romantic exploration of Central Park soon mutated into a desperate quest to find shade, sweating like a pig. 

My poor soon to be fiance keeps steering me in weird directions to find shade, but me being in the latest stages of heath induced brain melting, I kept not suspecting a thing. I do however whine like a child, and suggest to go home. He looks distressed to say the least, but perseveres. Looking back I should have suspected something when he passed the John Lennon mosaic without giving it more than a quick look, despite the fact that he venerates the man more than anything. 

We get to the Shakespeare gardens, and I see him panic, he just turns white: turns out, the gardens look pretty lame in the summer. I had just sat down in the shade, and he drags me away saying that ""there was no breeze"". 

Stupefied by low blood pressure, I weakly protest but I follow him. Just round the corner, there's a marble bench in the shade, on a high point looking out on most of the Park, very beautiful. However, there's a breeze, the marble is cool and the place is secluded. So I proceed to seat my ass on the bench, pull up my skirt, and unceremoniously start to fan myself with it, with great emphasis on fanning my downstairs in particular. 

He looks at me funny, but courageously takes my hand and I yell ""DON'T TOUCH ME, I'M TOO HOT!"". He seems like he want to tell me something, and that's when a huge German tourist, incredibly wearing the proverbial white socks and Crocs, a fisherman hat, big beard and glasses, walks in front of our bench and places himself on the lookout to the horizon, making satisfied noises. After loudly approving the panorama, he finally leaves.

This did not discourage my poor love either, so he held on to my sweaty paw, and proceeded to tell me how we have been in love for so long, how much he loves me, and how we should celebrate our love with all our friends and family. During this part I nod smiling like a drunk fool, not understanding a word, with my low blood pressure getting my ears roaring like the sea in winter.

Noticing the vacant look in my eyes, he finally gets on one knee. God intervenes evidently, because I finally put 2 and 2 together, emotion gets my pressure to go up, he asks ""Will you marry me?"" and I can only shout ""ARE YOU SURE??!!"".

10 years together, he obviously spent months preparing this proposal, he ignored my very unsexy overheating shenanigans, and all I can answer is...are you sure? 

He just gives me a look of disbelief, and I finally manage to shout ""OF COURSE YES!"", while I fan my armpits with my hands until he snatches my hand to put the ring on it, laughing like crazy, and getting me into a kiss.

So that was it....if we leave out the fact that we went home, I got a pore inflammation on my ladyparts for the heath, and when that finally went away, we thought we could get down to business...until the hotel fire alarm broke and we had to stay outside all night while the firemen tried to repair it.

Despite some demon must have jinxed the proposal we're now married for one year, together for 12 and trying to have a baby, so I guess I can't complain :P"
"Compared to other mammals, human biology is really, really bad at almost everything to do with children. Having big brains posed a problem with childbirth, and since hips can only get so wide, that means we need to give birth while the offspring are less developed. So as a trade-off for being smart in adulthood, human babies are much smaller, weaker, sicklier, and dependant-er for longer than related species, and even once we grow larger, we stay juvenile for an absurd portion of our total lifespan."

"Sometimes I'm afraid that behaviors I exhibited in my first major relationship were abusive. Things ended a little over five years ago and we were together seven years. 

The major thing I remember is turning fights around on him, which is something the next guy I dated would do to me every time so I was able to realize what that is like. I just *could not* apologize, I think I was holding so much unsaid stuff against him that I felt like I didn't have to? "
"that being triggered means shaking and crying. for many of us, it means getting a really strange feeling and feeling like going to bed to stare at the wall blankly for a few hours. and we're lucky if we even recognize a trigger at all and don't get this feeling out of ''nowhere''."

"I have a few, I think. They didn't seem funny to me at the time because that was just how it was but I know now that people find it really funny. Growing up in the Hebrides is a very odd thing. You're far removed from everything, you're very close to nature in a way and the people are so Scottish it's almost offensive. 

My most vivid memories are probably the primal, visceral fear when you learned that Scottish country dancing was for PE that period and the one time I had to dance with a boy I hated who had repeatedly told me how he'd pumped my maw, so I subtly punched him every time he was near me in a set. 

Then I ran almost all the way home with him on my tail and cut through a field of Highland cows because I knew he was afraid of them and then I got an earful from my nanny for soiling my white dress socks."
I wouldn't immediately do anything. I might buy him cool Lego sets for his birthday or Christmas. I'm a grown woman and have loads of nerf guns under my bed. 
"I have an extreme phobia of catching a specific disease. I would rather die than catch this disease. I am that fucking terrified.

Several years ago, I learned of various scenarios where I could be infected with this disease and not be able to get treatment. So I decided, if I kill myself now (at that time) then I can ensure I will never ever catch this disease and be in that situation. I didn't want to die, I just needed to ensure I'd never get infected, even if that meant death. Because dead people can't catch the disease.

Pretty soon, I was having at least hourly thoughts of how I was going to kill myself. This went on for 3-4 years. But I had hope because there are medical treatments you can get to make sure you don't ever catch the disease, and that's what I was finally able to get. After that, it was like flipping a switch to feeling basically normal. I haven't thought about killing myself since then. I went from having multiple panic attacks a week, to one a *year*."
Yes! We’re been married 6 years now and have 2 kids :) 
"About three years ago, they found abnormal cells on my cervix and told me they needed to remove them. I was told this was a normal outpatient procedure and relatively painless, so I wasn't offered any pain management. I consider myself to have a high tolerance for pain. It takes a lot to make me complain. But this experience was the worst pain I've ever experienced. The gynecologist got me on the table, prepped,  and then started cutting into me, and I instantly felt intense pain. It was so uncomfortable to feel it inside my body like that. I gritted my teeth for as long as I could but eventually started sobbing and begging her to stop. Her assistant had this very concerned look on her face, but the doctor just kept saying ""I'm almost done"". Tears were streaming down my face and I was holding back the need to wail. She wouldn't stop and didn't seem to be bothered that I was in so much pain. It made me feel like my pain was illegitimate. I didn't have any choice but to lay there and cry, completely helpless. It was so traumatizing for me, I couldn't use tampons for almost a year, and sex was uncomfortable, if not painful, for the same amount of time. I can't muster up the courage to go back for my annual pap, but I know I need to go. I have crippling anxiety just thinking about going for a routine exam. I won't ever forget that experience, or that doctor. "

"when shit hit the fan, i turned to work. my life was falling apart in front of me- failed my major exams, couldn't apply to university, got my heart broken and stomped on, and put on more weight than i've ever seen on my frame. i fell into depression and fuck, it was the worst.

redid the exam (got an A*), applying to a really cool course i would have never looked at otherwise, told the boy who broke my heart to fuck right off, and i've been working out for the last 8 months. started going to therapy, and i adore my therapist. he's the coolest, most understanding person i've known. i'm not where i want yet with my body, but goddamn, do i look good.

i'm going to keep working on my life, and i swear, when i graduate in june, i'm going to look hotter than a motherfuckin steam engine and i'll walk right past all my problems when i get my diploma. i can't wait. "
"Women falsely accusing men of rape after a night of consensual sex, because they 'regretted' it or because they were 'a little drunk' or whatever. I'm sure there are a very small number of cases where people are falsely accused of rape but I imagine the vast majority of cases are in grey areas or are just straight up assault/rape."
"Main character thinks he’s getting rescued by police in the end, but ends up getting shot by an officer. 

I believe Peele wanted the audience to cheer for the protagonist at the end and leave the theatre on a positive note, so he changed the ending. 

Edit: He wasn’t shot, my bad. Link above shows ending/commentary. The actual ending made majority BELIEVE he was going to get shot, and that just goes to show how well Peele understood the underlying fears/ideologies of modern day racism. "

I'm giving it time. Just like I would with a romantic relationship. I just remind myself that it was for the best. 
"Someone from my home town won the lottery a few years ago and decided to remain anonymous (until her husband starting working at the same place as me).

All Camelot (UK lottery) did was publish where she bought the ticket so the supermarket could put up a ""Winning Ticket Purchased Here"" sign or something similar.

I would prefer to stay anonymous just for my own safety."
"I was raised by my Irish grandmother. She didn’t believe in waste so she would make me sit at the dinner table and finish every scrap on my plate or I’d be sent to bed early with no food for the rest of the night, and get a good hiding with the wooden spoon if I argued back. 

So one day when I was about 9 I told her I wasn’t hungry but she didn’t believe me. I’d just walked home from school and hadn’t felt the Mae West all day. She sat dinner down in front of me and again I told her I wasn’t hungry. She sat on the chair beside me and said she wasn’t leaving until I’d finished every pick. I asked if I could heat it up later but she said no. Bear in mind I was an extremely skinny kid being bullied by a fat girl in school calling me “anorexic,” so I think sometimes nana worried that I was being picky over weight issues. 

Anyway, I wolfed down the food to get rid of it ASAP and went in to chill in the living room while my nana watched her soaps. About 2 minutes later, I feel this hot surge of lava come from my throat and made a mad dash for the bathroom. (The house only had one upstairs one back then so it was a fair distance for a sick kid to run). 

It was too late. I projectile vomited all over the bottom of her stairs and floor. I could hear the panic in her voice shouting my name as she heard me paint her carpet as she tried to make sure I’d reached the bathroom. 

She never forced me to eat again.

Edit: sucky spelling"
"I was 13 and suffering bad back pain, after many months Mum knew it wasn't growing pains and took me to a physio. I was developing a hunch and couldn't straighten my back up. The physio had a three minute look and loudy announced that once I had developed breasts I would 'straighten up to show them off'. As a flat chested 13 year old I was mortified and he destroyed my self confidence. 

Moved to a different town and went to a new physio few years later to learn that my continued back pain was from a result from my old people hips and needed intense physio to try and correct and I am still suffering from pain 8 years later. 

Ps still flat chested and rocking it ✌️ "

"I remember asking my mom once if we could leave. She looked at me with the most defeated look and said, ""Where would we go? What would we do?"" My entire life has basically been an effort to prevent myself from being in that situation. She made sure I got out and got an education, but she never left. She eventually finished her degree and now makes like, $75k in a low cost of living area but will basically never leave. 40 years sinks those claws in deep. "
"I love to race through the store, grabbing what I need. He loves to take his time and read labels and check out new products. Our five-year-old just likes to dance to whatever music is playing and clean the shelves with those antibacterial wipes.

"Black girl in the US. 

I played soccer all my life and I’m pretty good but I was always seen as the ‘naturally athletic’ one and ‘the beast’ on the team. I would do the most basic shit and people would be like “wow, beast mode is turned on!” Girls who were doing better than me never received this title, which I always found odd so I could totally relate to the main character. 

The annoyances I get all the time are people talking AAVE to me, touching my hair without asking, telling me they can dance or asking if I can teach them to dance (I cant even dance), telling me how much they love or hate hiphop when the convo had nothing to do with music or hiphop.

"Abortion argument. He had just had a baby a month earlier &amp; was saying ""Are you telling me my daughter wasn't a living human? I reached inside my wife &amp; grabbed her head! She was a human!""

Bro, a full-term baby literally being born is not what anyone is talking about when they say 'abortion'. He was trying to equate aborting a 9 week along pregnancy to killing a 40 week baby so he could blanket statement abortion as being evil."
"Ive attempted multiple times. I’ve never overcome it, and have been told my mental health issues are likely to continue in some way for the rest of my life. It seems to come in waves, right now I’m in an awful state. My reason for attempting is simple: wanting to escape. Escape the life I’m living, the feelings, sometimes being overwhelmed for a long time just leads to exhaustion. It feels like the only way out. "

"there's this new temp guy at my office (i'm a temp too) who is being unnecessarily friendly and keeps on imposing upon my personal time. like honestly can you take a hint when i always tell you i'm busy? 

he always insists upon grabbing dinner after work with me but i'm a broke ass girl so i usually eat at home. to which he would shamelessly insist that ""you can just watch me eat"". my biggest pet peeve is *watching people munch on their food while i am starving and hungry and denied of food myself.*

and despite being in his late-20s, he still labels the people he knows as ""popular"" or ""unpopular"". he thinks it's fine because ""i'm friends with people who are unpopular too!"" like newsflash, you're in your late-20s, people are busy getting forward in their careers and you are so concerned about such a fleeting characteristic. and nobody gives two fucks about popularity anymore. are you still stuck in high school?!

Me: Yeah those are my initials. What do you need?

Contractor: Are you sure?

As a black person, I detest potato salad.

***Update***:

Potato salad is served at nearly every black social function or gathering— especially during the warmer months. Yes like collards or mac &amp; cheese it is comfort food, tradition. 

Most black people will only eat it if it is prepared by someone they know— never store bought! That is sacrilege! Every family— hell every family *member* has a distinct favorite recipe and to not like it— to not even want to try it is considered offensive and blasphemous. But I do not like the texture— potatoes are for frying or mashing only—at least to me :)"

"Being allowed to have feelings? Not really a joke lol. Sometimes I feel bad for men bc it seems like they're expected to perform soooo much emotional labor. Women do as well, but it just looks as if being male would be exhausting in a way that being female isn't really. No crying, no vulnerability, no weakness, no ""girly interests,"" no anything or you are Not A Real Man.

We can share clothes and IDs, I have a built-in “interesting fact about myself” for those dumb ice breaker things, we absolutely destroy at board games.

Worst:

Not really much, anymore. As adults that don’t live together and lead pretty different lives there aren’t really any negatives. As kids I didn’t love being grouped together all the time, always being forced to share things and feeling like I didn’t really have my own identity. That definitely isn’t an issue anymore though. "

"Dating abusive or disrespectful people.

My current boyfriend is one of the least possessive, most honest people I've ever met, and in most ways the polar opposite of a stereotypically abusive partner. It feels weird sometimes when I see those ""omg I'm fucking done dating men"" sentiments bc all the men I've dated were very kind. "
"I love museums but I walk through museums the same way I shop for clothes. That is, I walk into the room and make a quick circuit, and unless something catches my eye that I *really* want to examine better, I move on. I rarely just stop and really look at something in a museum - I keep moving and just glance around as I go.

One day I was doing this in the Met in NYC and I noticed that the security guards kept following me. Sometimes a guy would follow me for three or four rooms, and then as soon as I stopped to look closer at a painting, he'd leave.

I mentioned this to a friend of mine who works at a museum and she started laughing. Apparently museum employees are trained to flag behavior like mine as a sign that someone is casing the museum for a theft. I just like walking when I'm in museums and don't like crowds."
"“Are you sure you didn’t just regret it” a male doctor at a mental hospital, after being forced to file a police report for an assault that was over a year old. I did so much better when I repressed it. Most of the people there had been sexually assaulted. I felt even more disgusted that he could’ve asked all the traumatized people I saw there the same thing. "
"At least she's being honest. I think 90% of ""pro-life"" people who cry ""but adoption!"" as a reason women shouldn't get abortions actually probably feel the same way about adoption, given the way they talk about taking responsibility. There have been plenty of cases of women with unplanned pregnancies being [shunned](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/us/teen-pregnancy-religious-values-christian-school.html?_r=0) by whatever community for giving up the baby. The real sin is getting pregnant in the first place."
My professor said once in class “I don’t wanna speak for anybody here but I’m pretty sure we all believe in basic human rights” and the guy behind me was literally talking about drowning people in pools of bleach before class started. 
"I have never seen a woman tell someone they needed to find them attractive


Supposedly women in the HAES/body positive movement *demand* dudes find them attractive and it's oppression or some shit if they don't


I've never, in my years of tumbling and redditing and real life-ing, heard anyone say that ever"
"I don't get this one at all.

"I remember a pregnancy test commercial with women looking very anxious to see the results.

On reddit a few years later, some users were saying ""I remember that commercial, and I relate exactly to how it feels when you're trying to get pregnant.""

And I was like ""Wait. I always thought the women in the commercials were worried about being pregnant!""

Another user said ""Of course they made it vague on purpose so people in both situations can relate to the anxious looking woman. You done been advertised."""
"I'm married now, but this used to be my situation.  For me, it helped to start tracking what I was doing with my time.  That caused me to realize how much time I was wasting on things that I wanted less than a good relationship.  

Every week has 168 hours in it.  If we take your upper figure and back out 70 for work, 7 for the commute, and 56 for sleep, that leaves 35 hours to do with what I want.  Some of those hours are dedicated to things I need to do (e.g., eat breakfast) and others to things that I actually value (e.g., going to the gym).  Many others, though, are dedicated to things I care about less, like browsing Reddit or goofing off on my phone.  I mean, 35 hours is almost a full work week for some people, so it's a decent amount of time.  

Once I realized how much time I had been wasting, I made a conscious effort to put more of that free time into things like dating, which have a better long-term payoff.  Hope this helps! "
Exit only. 
"UK SB here. I think you have to use your judgement. The bowl can attract weirdos/users on both sides. But so can tinder. I've been on a large number of dates where it felt like the guy just wanted sex in return for a steak dinner. Each time I politely (And once not so politely!) refused. If you are desperate for cash to pay bills, it can leave you vulnerable to exploitation. If you're looking for mutual chemistry with a guy who works hard, is experienced and wants to treat you well, it can be a very happy situation.

I waited it out and found a gorgeous guy who hasn't pressured me for sex once. He's smart, we have great conversations and go to fabulous places. Sure, he's away a lot, but I'm at uni, and so I have time to focus on my studies; meaning that when we do meet up we bring the best of ourselves to the relationship. I have an allowance of £3,500 a month. To him money is no object, but he knows it matters to me.

Advice to any SB starting out: make sure it's what you really want. Make sure you are safe on dates; always have an escape route and tell a friend where you are. And don't ever settle."

"I moved to another country and became seriously depressed. I still had another 6 weeks to wait until I was able to see a doctor in that country, so in desperation I called my family doctor. Despite not being her patient and the 6 hour time difference, she called me back (at 5 am her time), talked me through what I was feeling, doubled my medications, coached me through what to say to the new doctor to get the right treatment immediately, and had me call her every week until I got in to see someone. "
"Had a very mean lady accuse me of drug seeking when I came in for antibiotics for a sinus infection. She said my eyes were too dilated and I brought up that's how I look and I'd taken day quil as well. She gave me such a rude experience I actually snapped at her and she claimed, ""any mentally healthy person would know that's not how you talk to a doctor."" 

I got up and walked out. I was so furious and so sick and tired and I just cried in my car. I couldn't hear and all I wanted was to be well. I never even mentioned pain meds. Pain meds have nothing to do with a sinus infection so I have no idea where she was coming from with her attitude or assumptions. 

If I could go back I would have reported it and tried to get her in trouble. "
"Unfortunately I think it's mostly genetic, but there are some things you can do. Here's my routine that's helped my hair quite a bit:


* Coconut oil/castor oil hair mask overnight once per week. The only time I shampoo my hair is after the coconut oil (ALWAYS sulfate free shampoo)
* Olaplex no. 3 once per week
* Conditioner every other day (silicone free)
* No heat styling if possible
* Don't brush or comb hair while wet


Hope that helps!"
"I make time to go to hair salon once a month: whether it's for a full haircut, bangs cut only, or eyebrows. It makes me feel good to spend a little money on myself in this way.

After contemplating about buying an item I really want for months or years, I will eventually buy it for myself.

I make time to see my friends even when I am very busy and stressed out.

I do my best to get enough sleep nightly as well as to eat regular meals. I buy myself snacks without thinking twice about it, even if it's unhealthy or expensive. I eat and drink what I like and I don't eat or drink what I don't like. It annoys my boyfriend because he thinks I am too picky, but I am not willing to change my favourite food/drinks preferences to please someone else.

I go to the gym and concentrate on my fitness goals while I am there. I don't allow other thoughts/distractions until after I am done at the gym.

At work, I will take time to get small breaks if needed, such as as getting water if I am thirsty, going to washroom, taking my full lunch and eating, chatting with coworkers. It helps me relieve stress during the workday.

Once a week, I try to have at least one day or one morning entirely to myself. 

I also try to learn something new everyday, even if it's just something small. I even buy myself new books pertaining to self-development.

I write in a journal daily. It's just small things that I felt impacted my day. It's barely 3 sentences.

I used to keep a gratitude journal but I find that too tedious, now I just mentally think about things I am grateful for from time to time.

I make time to talk to my friends, especially the ones that live faraway that I grew up with. I share with them my fears, hopes, and dreams. I listen to theirs. It's nice. I have a few friends that I truly cherish (4 of them) and there are a few others that I also really appreciate but we aren't as close as I like yet. I also make time to slowly bond with people (such as coworkers or a friend I have known for years but the bond isn't as strong yet). 

I tell people if they do something I don't like that affects me. It is quite uncomfortable and I don't like conflict, but I will talk to them about it so that it doesn't happen again.

Every morning, I like to put on moisturizer/sunscreen. It makes me feel good that I am protecting my skin. I keep a moisturizer tube at my work desk, in my favourite bag, and also next to my bed at home. I also like to floss my teeth daily and I used to be pretty bad at flossing, but I like taking care of my teeth.

I like to keep track of my money. I am pretty obsessed with how I spend my money. I check my bank accounts a few times a week. Whenever I purchase something, I also record it in my calender and at the end of the month, I track how much I spent on dates with my boyfriend, with my friends, on myself, on food, on gifts for others, etc. I also set limits on how much I can spend each week and then I put the rest into savings.

I am currently into minimalism (sort of, not really) and I have basically been trying to organize all my possessions and only keep the ones that I really like, have some sentimental value, and/or are actually useful. So far, my bed room feels very nice because it's basically only the things that I really like, feel has some value, are useful, and makes me happy. I'm still going through my clothes but I am almost done with that, hoping to finish this weekend or next weekend.

I like to take showers and just imagine that all the negative thoughts/experiences/feelings are being washed away. I feel refreshed afterwards.

I try to stay away from negative people. I had one coworker who only spoke about her negative past experiences, negative present experiences, etc. I basically stayed away from her as much as possible. I was really glad when she decided to leave last month.

I try to spend time with people whose company I actually like. Sometimes, my friends do go through hard times and I will be there for them. I also know they will bounce back because they are strong.

I set a few goals for myself each year and accomplish them. The feeling of achieving things that I personally sincerely want without influence from others makes me happy. I remember when I was younger, I cared about achieving things that I thought other people wanted me to (such as parents, etc.).

I also make time for myself to read everyday. This is an important hobby of mine.

Okay well, this is already really long. Hope this helps someone.

"A copy and paste of a previous comment of mine:

I went to my gp for my depression/anxiety after years of trying to struggle through it. I sobbed my heart out and told him all my symptoms. 

He asked if I had a job, I said yes. He said if I had a job I was going to then I can't be depressed. He then rubbed his thumb across my forehead (big no no) and said I was sweating and it was the heat, not anxiety. He then asked if I loved my partner, I said yes. He asked if I wanted to have babies with him, I said no (a life choice I have made) and he said that I couldn't possibly love my partner if I didn't want to have babies. He told me to go have a baby and it would all be better, I was just sad because I'm a girl.

That's the first time I seriously considered downing a bottle of pills or taking up drinking. "

"I knew that my now husband had the ring. He kept that no secret. Our daughter was 2 at the time and still in diapers. We were watching a movie in bed one evening after our daughter was in bed and I left the room to get water.

"Don't remove makeup with makeup remover. Shower, let mascara run all over your face, use face wash in shower, then wipe off the excess with moisturizer. 

Paint your nails before you shower, so that you can do a rush job and then wash the extra polish off of your fingers. 

Have a bunch of the same black socks so that you don't have to match everything all the time. 

Sleep with hair in buns so you have curly hair in the morning when you take it out and everyone thinks you're fancy. 

Wear leggings to sleep that you can wear with a skirt in the morning so you don't have to put on real pants in the a.m.

but each time i only got help as long as they thought was ''long enough'' to look like good parents, so i had to repeat a couple times when necessary. i don't know why i didn't tell the hospital what was happening at home... i guess i knew i'd be going back and i better not for my safety.

so yeah i guess i did it ''for attention''. attention meaning i wanted my mental illness actually treated and my feelings about living in a severely abusive environment validated. so i hate when people brush off self harm and suicide as just for attention. attention does not always mean a spoiled kid.

now that i have help and my life circumstances improved dramatically, i have not been tempted to do it again."

Surprise pregnancy and marriage at age 17.   He was 17 as well.    We struggled through growing up and falling in love.  This year will be 35 years together.

After they were done you would get a bucket of cold water from a well poured over your head. Cheers to cleansing you for the next year 😅

"Depression - that men are more depressed in general because they tend to have more successful suicide attempts. I'm sick of hearing this, because it's well known in the medical community that women suffer from depression at around twice the rate of men and attempt suicide more often.

GAD - not just Reddit, but I have heard people on other subreddits imply that people taking medication for anxiety (especially benzodiazepines) just faking their anxiety so they can get high or something. Also, that everyone is anxious sometimes so anxiety disorders aren't a real thing. I've had people ask me, including doctors, ""what are you anxious about?"" There's no ""what."" I'm just anxious *all the time*. That is my default state. "
