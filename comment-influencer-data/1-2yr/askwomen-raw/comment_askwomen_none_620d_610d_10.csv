"i can’t find the meme after mad googling but i remember an actual text convo meme that literally went something like this.

guy: nudes?
girl: I understand. You found paradise in America, had a good trade, made a good living. The police protected you; and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a nude of me. But now you come to me and you say -- ""Don Corleone give me nudes."" -- But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to send nudes, for nothing."
"I really loved that girl that sent a message saying ""Attachement sent"" and resent it everytime the guy said it didn't work. "
"That if someone is shitty enough and they want to cheat, they're going to do it. It doesn't matter how good of a partner or how worried I am, or whether I try to prevent it, and at this point in my life that's not something I want to waste my energy on. I shouldn't have to police my partner's behavior to keep them from cheating on me or making me suspicious that they might, and if I did, they wouldn't be right for me anyways. "
"My husband and I do a thing called ""fake restaurant"" where we will clean up the house, dim most lights so the atmosphere is romantic, he'll put on a really nice record and I'll cook something semi-difficult/french/or a steak haha. We open a bottle of wine and look our best and never leave the house, but the effect is the same- we enjoy each other and life is beautiful :) 

We also play fake massage parlor, with clean made bed all freshly laundered and smelling warm from the dryer, massage oils, and soft music/candles. We're not always (ok most of the time, but really not always!) making it sexy, it's just so relaxing. Usually only one person gets massaged because who wants to be the masseuse after you're all relaxed from a massage? So it's really an honor system for keeping it even, who gets to be the massage-ee and how often we play haha. 

Saves so much money, keeps us excited to clean the house, absolutely romantic, and we get to enjoy each other's company and have positive experiences together in our own house!"
"I'm going to be brutally honest here.

I never wanted kids, but I felt pressured into it by my husband and even my mom. A few weeks before I turned 29, our son was born.

I love my son and I do everything I can to make sure he is safe and happy. But I absolutely hate the work of being a parent. I feel like I'm not good at it, I feel like it doesn't come naturally to me, and I feel emotionally drained at the end of the day. To make matters worse, I had to come off all my antidepressants to get pregnant, and after 3 years I'm still not stable. It's really hard to put on a happy face and go play house with a toddler when all I want to do is stay in bed and cry.

If you don't want kids, don't let anyone push or bully you into it. You will end up resenting those people in the end. You have to do what you think is right for you."
"Travelling.  I find it more stressful than my job and less fun than a quiet weekend at home, so I just don't do it any more."
"I saw one called ""This one mom"". So relatable."
It just stays between my wizard's sleeves. 
"I don't really like french kissing.  I can get past it during the initial infatuation stage, but while I'm perfectly happy with sex, petting, oral sex, snuggling, anal sex, and more, I just find kissing kind of gross.  Spit, weird tastes, too much tongue vs not enough tongue, teeth or no teeth, my neck hurting from pushing our faces together...  

It gets me really in my head and out of my body, and turns me off, but it's really hard to explain to someone without them taking it like a personal criticism, I guess because it's not that common.  People tend to take it as a covert way to say I'm not interested in sex, when that's really not the case."
I once had a guy that was super persistent after I told him no (politely) many times. So I told him to hold on and then I found his mom on FB and sent him a picture of her. He was LIVID. 
"""New England Clam Router"" was especially funny because the neighbors were from Maine."
"Gotta say I'm a little shaken up by the answers in this thread. I worked for years to be swift as a coursing river in order to feel like a man and to be considered one. So many hours clambering up posts with a silk scarf, jumping between partially submerged stones, and hiding my ancestrally haunted dragon...all wasted."
"Everyone is scandalized that I don’t like Game of Thrones. “It has everything you love! Magic, dragons, fighting! How can you not like it???”


I just don’t. "
"""tell my wifi love her""

additionally, ""it hurts when IP"""
"How long ago was this? What were the circumstances? Do you buy his story? Now that you know this about him, is it answering questions about weird late-night texts he’s been getting or extremely late work nights? If you’d done something your were rightfully ashamed of with an ex, how and when would you bring that up to your new partner?

I think there are definitely serial cheaters who love the thrill of the chase, but I also think that some people cheat once, go “oh man that felt fucking awful and I’m never doing that again,” then live the rest of their lives not cheating. "
"This is so minor compared to everything people are going to say, but it really wore on me all year. She would stay up until 3 am texting with the keyboard sounds on. "
"A lot of the women in my family believe that showering/bathing/getting your body wet while on your period is a surefire way to ruin your uterus.


????????????"
"Talking about kids. I’m a SAHM, so people assume that’s my only/main interest. If I’m actually having a conversation with another adult, that’s the last thing I want to discuss. 

I already deal with my toddler all day, every day. I don’t really want to hear about yours or to tell you about mine. "
I talked way too damn much and listened too damn little. Don’t do this to yourself. 
Don't question women about what they were doing/wearing/drinking if they tell you they were assaulted. Call out your bros for making offensive statements. Don't tell us something isn't true because you haven't personally witnessed it. 
I once saw a girl sending gifs of a picture loading-icon. The guy was going crazy about how the images wouldn’t load :D
"Turn your comparisons into compliments and remove yourself from the equation.

For example, when I see a woman who looking stunning, I would instantly think 'she looks better than me.' I try instead to think 'yes girl! You look like a godess!!'

Her being pretty does not negate my being pretty.it's not that easy, and I am not always successful, but that's my mental process."
A guy asked me what my bra size was and I said 32GB. When he asked what the “G” meant I said it stood for a Gigaboob 
I don't owe a dude an explanation for why I'm not attracted to him.
"Oh god, this question is bringing me back to when I worked at a dry cleaners and this one lady always brought in her slacks with discharge all up in them. I had to take notes about what kind of things needed to be cleaned on garments and I never knew what to put for that in case she saw the notes on her receipt later. "
Tea. I'm British. It's practically heresy
"I travel alone about 90% of the time and it's the tops. No compromises, and the possibilities for unforgettable experienced are endless. Recent trips over the last year include London, Paris, Denver, And San Francisco. First and most obvious tip: use common sense. Be friendly, smile, speak to strangers, but listen to your intuition. Don't be afraid to give out fake info about yourself if you think you're in an iffy situation. 

Airport bars are great ways to kill time. It's likely you won't see the person sitting next to you ever again, why not make idle conversation? 

Plan! If you're going to be out late at night, make sure you have a plan to get back to your accommodation and understand what type of transportation options are in your destination. I always budget for Ubers and taxis. You never know when you'll be having too much fun and suddenly find yourself out in a place you don't know in the middle of the night.

Leverage technology. I love interacting with locals but avoid asking for directions as much as possible. Google maps is your friend. Bring a kindle/ereader. If you feel uncomfortable or find that random people are harassing you, stick earbuds in your ears. You don't have to be listening to anything but you can pretend like you can't hear anything. 

If you need recommendations on where to eat or what to do, the hotel staff is the best option. I've gotten some awesome local recommendations (and places to avoid) while checking into my hotels. 

I always feel accomplished coming home from a trip without incident, and these are most of the precautions I take to ensure I have a great experience!

"
"Letting each other know if we’ll be home later than usual. Big arguments about that one for the first couple of months. 

It’s hard to switch from living on your own and doing whatever you pleased whenever you pleased, to now having to be mindful of another person’s schedule when making plans. 

If you decide to get drinks after work and not come home until late, you need to make sure your SO knows that. You don’t know if they’re waiting on you to come home.  E.g. they’ve made dinner and wanted to surprise you when you were off. 

It’s not about “keeping track” of each other. It’s about thinking beyond yourself and realizing you are part of a unit now, and your plans now affect your partner.

Also often depressed and easily frustrated. Got cats though"
"&gt; I also think that some people cheat once, go “oh man that felt fucking awful and I’m never doing that again,” then live the rest of their lives not cheating. 

I agree. “Once a cheater always a cheater” is a cliche, empty statement fueled throughout the years by confirmation bias."
"She needed a room for summer classes so my housemates obliged since she seemed normal during our meet and greet.

Over the course of summer though, she ate my food and had the audacity to put all the wrappers and boxes back into my cabinet as if nothing happened. She also routinely made 3 cups of rice a night because the minimum measurement on my rice cooker was 3 cups...

...honestly, the latter wouldn't have been a big deal but then I found out ""she doesn't do leftovers"" so she was eating about 1/2 a cup then dumping the rest to trash every night.

Then before school started she decided to take a trip to Guatemala. Awesome, right? No...this girl helped herself to our shoes, sandals, and clothing for the trip cause she ""didn't want to get hers dirty"". She only had access without permission because the rest of us had gone back home to spend the last few weeks of summer with our families.

We unianimously kicked her out before the fall semester began again."
"Send back some [artistic nudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_(art\)) . Depending on your mood, you can give him anything from Renaissance sculptures to Francis Bacon's [*Reclining Woman*](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bacon-reclining-woman-t00453). The only caveat is that if he's into art history, he'll probably find them hilarious."
"I'm hanging out with my sister (who is a black...I'm white, we're the same age, parents adopted her when she was 6 months old) and I asked her this question bc she doesn't have reddit. These are a few things she recalled off the top of her head: 
- Was once told she dates white men because wasn't strong enough to handle black men
- Was called a ""bed wench"" (had to look this one up; I had never heard of it before) 
- Felt like some (not all) black men took her dating outside her race as a personal affront 
- Has been told she ""thinks she's white"" (side note, she was told this by other people growing up her whole life, and we grew up in a pretty diverse city and school) 
- Was told she was betraying her history and ancestors "
"Oh. Oh man.

Black woman in Florida. Married my high school sweetheart. He moved to Florida from New York. He's mayo white. We've been together 15 years, married for 7. Went to college together. Both have decent jobs, work in IT. Own a house. And yet, the things I hear...

- ""Well, you left us so you can't talk on racism.""
- ""White man's bedwench.""
- ""My Queen, why do you this to yourself?""
- ""Self hate is a thing."" /said snidely.

I usually respond with, ""We would still get sold for the same amount in 1610, be in the same school in 1953, and probably die without justice if we were murdered today, so keep on with that."" I do plenty with and focused specifically on the black community in my area, mainly with children/literacy and sports. I march and fuck Facebook likes, I do that shit 'cause I want to. My hair is natural because I want it that way (the amount of my fellow people who are boggled when my husband says, ""I don't care about hair but she does so what she likes, I love because it's on her"" is hilarious). *I season my goddamn food*. (jk, but no really, I do). And yet I am sometimes met with surprise after people get to know me. ""Damn, ok, you still a sista, *Star Trek* shirt, white dude, and all.""

Wow, thanks. It's almost like we can like different stuff and be attracted to different types of people. FOH. "
"Terminally ill people should have access to death with dignity in all jurisdictions.

I've watched a few close family members die pretty shitty deaths, especially compared to how humanely we treat dogs, and I'm dismayed that option is not technically on the table.  Even if folks don't use it, it can be comforting to know the option exists if dying the ""natural"" way gets too rough.  "
"There are a *ton* of opinions that I have invested a great deal of time in reaching a conclusion that I’m very, very confident in. If I had to pick one though — I’ll also say abortion. I’ll never, ever budge on my firm opinion that legal and accessible abortion is a critical part of women’s health care. "
"A lot of people have preconceived notions on what I'm into based on my hair, tattoos, and piercings. People think I like to party. In reality, I'm kind of an introvert, stay home most of the time, and play a lot of video games. I rarely drink, I don't use any recreational drugs, and I'm pretty boring. Lol."
"Oooo me me!!
I was arrested twice in college. Both for drug possession. I’m not talking meth or heroin here, I’m talking acid, molly, and good ol’ Mary Jane. 

I was in my very last semester of college and student teaching at a local middle school. I had straight A’s and got praised regularly by my professors and classroom teachers. I had a lot of fun and was excited to begin a career in teaching!

Then my house got raided, long story short it was a huge misunderstanding but since I had some acid and molly in my bedroom I went straight to jail. The day before that was literally the last day I saw my students! The school board immediately expelled me from the property (they knew I had been arrested as I suddenly didn’t show up for 3 days and attendance is very strict in these programs. Plus it was a very small town in rural Georgia). 

I had teachers writing letters to the judge, teachers fighting with the school board, etc. but it didn’t work. My college didn’t kick me out necessarily but they did kick me out of the education program. 

So here I am in my final semester of college and suddenly all of my hard work over the past few years got swept out from under me! 

I had to do an intense probation program to just get felonies off my record. It took YEARS to get all of this settled. I worked shitty restaurant jobs, lived in poverty, and watched all of my peers succeed over those years. 

So yes, it did have a huge effect on my academics. More so, it had a huge effect on every other facet of my life. I still have PTSD from that day my house was raided, and the days I spent in jail, and all of the paranoia that ravaged my life for 3 years. But I am doing well for myself now! I definitely figured out how resilient I was through this whole ordeal! :)"

The only time I don't wear underwear is when I'm wearing yoga pants or leggings because the cloth still ""catches"" everything and then I just wash the pants. I also sleep nude from the waist down but since I'm laying down the discharge doesn't really go anywhere. "

What makes it doubly confusing is I have a ridiculous amount of R2D2 merch. Measuring cups, mugs, throw pillow, lamp. It's just that my family are among those who are confused by my not liking Star Wars and get me more Star Wars stuff every Christmas. But I don't have to be super into the movies to think R2D2 stuff is cool, so I'm not bummed!"

"About a year after my ex-husband and I split, I went on a few dates with a guy I met online. There was some interest there on my part and he was definitely into it. 

On our third date, he told me that he really liked me and was interested in more with me, and asked how I felt. I just panicked. And I realized that I was absolutely not over my ex-husband, and not at all ready to start another relationship. 

So I told him that, awkwardly, because I’d never really had that conversation with someone before and had no idea how to do it. At one point I just started spluttering “I can’t do this.” 

He took it *so well.* It was so not a big deal. He replied “hey, I get it, and I appreciate you telling me that. I still think you’re great, so, want to just be friends instead?” 

And the thing is, we actually did do “just friends” instead. No pressure from him at all. We hung out a number of times as friends over the years and eventually drifted apart naturally. 

But I’m still really grateful to him because honestly, I was still such an emotional wreck from my toxic marriage (in ways I didn’t even understand until later), that I think I really needed to have those few dates to start reacclimatizing to normal life and realize just how far I still had to go to be truly ready to date again. He helped me navigate that, and I’m grateful. "
"A lot of other users here have said this already, but another woman's attractiveness doesn't negate your own.

"I’m 33 and I’ve sort of changed my mind. My certainty that I’d never have children always stemmed from the fact that I know, for a host of reasons, that I can’t/won’t get pregnant.  
Once I decoupled “pregnancy” from “child,” I realized I did actually like the idea of having and raising a kid with my awesome husband. So now we’re in the process of adopting :) "

"I fainted. In the middle of a team meeting with about 50 people around, on my second day. They called the paramedics and an alert was sent out about a week later on it since they had to upgrade the procedures for if an incident like that happened again. It was a great ice breaker!"
"Started walking the dogs because I noticed all they did was sleep - and it ended up changing MY life. Getting outside in nature is truly a game-changer.

I live on acreage and the dogs have plenty of room to roam, so I couldn’t figure out why they had no desire. They just slept all day and got really lazy. Then it dawned on me one day that the dogs are a reflection of me - I, too, have plenty of room to roam outside, but I wasn’t doing it. 

So we started with short walks and it recaptured my love for the outdoors. Many of my aches and pains slowly faders and I fall asleep faster. The doggies absolutely loved it and they have this new excitement to life. I use my outdoor time to listen to uplifting/motivational videos on YouTube. I always feel so refreshed and it’s really changed my life! I used to be a person who only worked out indoors; now I can’t survive unless I get outside in the fresh air and sunshine. Even on days it’s cold, it still feels better to me! "
"I sent a picture of my dog’s cameltoe. I also like the one when a guy asked for a nude and she said it was dark because the lights were off. He said he didn’t care, to send it anyway so she sent him a completely black picture  that she took in the dark. "
"I don't want to date people I don't know. I mean, I'd so much rather get to know someone as a friend and then date them rather than randomly finding someone to go out with. It just feels artificial to me. 

It makes dating difficult because this doesn't seem to be how anyone else feels about it. "
"The important one no one thinks of... 
what do you think moving in together signifies? Some say “next step in the relationship, 1 year until marriage, maximum” and others say “splitting the bills while dating makes sense! Why not? It’s not a huge deal and it’s not going to be any different than it is now.” 

Neither are bad. But you HAVE to be on the same page. "
"To preface, a guy from my church came over to my house one night while I had a cold and we watched a chick flick. No interest in each other or anything. We talked and ended up making out randomly. He left and I didn't hear from him for like a week. I was being a girl and wondering if he'd ever call or if it was strictly a NCMO (non commital make out). But then I thought screw it, I'm going to call him. It was a Tuesday, I texted and asked if he was hungry. He said he'd just finished dinner with his family but would join me while I got food. I'd just learned he was from Mexico, so I took him to the most legit Mexican restaurant I knew. I drove since he didn't have a car. At the restaurant I ordered something and he saw the menu and decided on a second dinner and then offered to pay even though I had been planning on paying. We ate and talked for almost two hours. Today is our fourth wedding anniversary. He says that my asking him out and taking the initiative was what made him actually take a second look instead of calling it a NCMO and nothing more. Not everyone is a douche. And at least you find out if they suck right off the bat by making the first move."

"I wish I'd asked for help more. I'm very stubborn, and am always irrationally worried that asking for help makes me seem inept. There's a learning curve with every job, with my last job it took about a month for me to become acclimated. Even basic things such as where certain supplies were located. I feel like as time goes on, if you stay silent your colleagues will assume you have things under control and it becomes more difficult to ask for help. If there's anything you have questions or are confused about, ask right away."
"I started to bring my lunch to work due to the need of saving money. At the end of the year, I lost about 40lbs so Im pretty grateful for that."
"Call people out on their shitty behavior. It's already been established that a certain brand of asshole doesn't really listen to women at all... so this is where male allies come in.   Sexist assholes are more likely to listen to men than women so if they hear that they're being a douchecanoe by harassing or talking over women or whatever, they may be more likely to step back and take a look at themselves."

"This one doesn't really annoy me, but it annoys me that people criticize me for it:

"Well, before my meds I didn’t enjoy anything. I forced myself to hike and do yoga and socialise and all that, but the entire time I would be thinking “I just wish this would end so I could go to bed”. I couldn’t even have orgasms ffs.
I spent a lot of time wishing I would get hit by a car or get a terminal disease, but I couldn’t bring myself to actually off myself cos I knew my siblings and friends would be sad.

After my meds it was like stepping out of a black and white world into one with colour.
I have the desire and the energy to do activities and create things, and feel rewards from those. I find joy in things I never did before. I have a healthy fear of death.
The *biggest* thing though was that I now notice the mannerisms and expressions and tiny reactions that make people seem so beautiful. Like, so many people are so adorable in their own little microscopic ways; I never noticed that before. Life is *so much more enjoyable* with that, for some reason."
Hid it like actively lied to me about it or hid it like just didn't bring it up? If it's the latter I'd probably shrug it off. Everyone's done things they're not proud of. If he lied about it when asked I'd have an issue with that.

I was like ""Yeah, ok, that's fair. All good reasons."" and he immediately asked me to play Overwatch with him, so now we play together once a week or so. We're still good friends and occasionally hang out on weekends, and help each other with projects. 

Combination of ""I know you"" ""I like you as a person"" and ""We can still be friends tho"" made it the best rejection I've ever had! ahah~ I actually think of him more fondly because of it. He's a good person =)

I can't say I never wanted children but when I thought about my future children weren't in it. I didn't love them or hate them. 

I ended up getting married at 32 and having 2 kids at 36 &amp; 39. 

I love them completely as the individuals they are. They don't complete me, I complete myself. I like having them around and enjoy the joyful moments they give me and the lessons I've learned. 

If I hadn't had them I would still be fine, just a different person. "
"This should be super obvious but: 

* arrive early. 
* know where you're going &amp; who you are looking for (e.g. the boss you're told to report to on the first day)
* have a pen and notepad with you to start writing stuff down. While the workplace should provide these, people tend to not tell you where the stationary cupboard is until *after* they've told you 15 other things you'll want to remember. 
* be flexible about lunch, if your coworkers go to lunch together, join them. At least at first. If you go somewhere for lunch alone, arrive back *before* your lunch break is over. If you're with co-workers and they're pushing the length of the break, go back early if you can (unless your direct boss is with you also, then you'll have to feel out the situation). 
* Ask lots of questions. 

Edit: 

* don't try out a new outfit if you can, wear something you know you'll be comfy in and that is appropriate for whatever you might get asked to do. I can always tell when the new kid is uncomfortable in their big-girl clothes. Often they wear something *too* formal/stiff and struggle with easy physical work like bending over to pick up a box of pipettes from the floor (which is obviously part of lab work). 
* Make sure you have tampons/pads/whatever with you. Find out where the restrooms are early. Don't be shy about asking for a toilet break if someone is explaining something and you need to change your lady products. (I once had a new summer intern - she was only 16 - leak through because she was to nervous to ask to go to the toilet and she had to ask to go home early. That wasn't an issue and I don't judge her for it but avoid that kind of situation.)"
"Assuming this request came from a guy you are dating and not just some stranger,

"I've had a lot of people assume I'm churchy when I'm actually an atheist, so I guess God/religion.

I grew up in a very conservative branch of Christianity, but started pulling away from that when I was 12. Somehow, something in my mannerisms or appearance still makes people I meet at work think I must attend church regularly 18 years later."
"It was on my first real date which was a month before my 27th birthday.

"At age 30 I had the same problem as you. It stopped at some point in my 30s (I'm 40 now). 

It helps to be resolute (try laughing a little as you say no, as in ""haha, God no I'm not doing that"").  It helped to take medical steps (""haha, no, thank goodness I'm sterilized""). Annoying as it is, I think it also helped me to be married; something about ""we've discussed it and we don't want kids"" is more persuasive than ""I don't want kids"", because it takes away the ""you will when you meet the right partner"" argument. 

The thing is... I'm sad that I know all these stupid tricks. I guess it goes to show how long people disrespected MY very solid decisions for, before it finally stopped. "

"Early on in my relationship, my boyfriend jokingly sent me one of those, ""What are you wearing?"" texts. I told him that I was wearing a fez and a vest with no pants on. He asked for pics, then I told him that I couldn't currently operate a camera, because when I unzip my human skin, I'm actually that cymbal-banging monkey toy from everyone's nightmares.

(It's less funny because once I actually looked those toys up, most of them actually are wearing pants. I don't know why I always imagined them pantsless, Winnie the Pooh style, but I did. I was really sad when this was pointed out.)

In general though, my feeling is that if you can steer the conversation in a really weird and unexpected direction, it's a deterrent to those types of requests continuing."
"I once had a friend of a friend ask for nudes, so I sent him a picture of my SO's very hair man ass.  I received a thumbs up emjoi and we never spoke again."

"My boyfriend has been doing yoga with me in the evenings! It's just for half an hour but it's a really special time and it means a lot to me that he's joining me in my practice. Plus, I get to reach over and touch his butt."
It sounds like the modern dynamic of casual dating doesn’t work for you and that’s totally okay. It doesn’t have to. I don’t think you should try to avoid getting attached to people and if the idea of exclusivity is preferred then voice that and look for that. 
Pubic hair = unhygienic.
"I like the *idea* of it, but the reality is that I am not okay with not having running water for days, and I'm not okay with being around a bunch of other people who haven't had running water for days, not to mention I don't really enjoy being around people who are high for prolonged periods. "
Eating meat. The way we treat food animals is pretty abhorrent. However meat is delicious and also my diet relies on meat as a main component. Personally I'm looking forward to when we start growing steaks in the lab and no more animals have to be harmed.
That body hair is unhygienic.  For some reason this applies to women but not to men.

"I'm drunk, so forgive me, but I think that I'm undateable because I have so many walls and boundaries to break down in order to get to the side of me that's open, loyal to a fault, and extremely prone to separation anxiety. "
"People have been shocked to find out that I've never seen a single episode of Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, or The Walking Dead, and that I don't really care about superhero movies or Star Wars."
"Simply fucking incredible. Better than oral, better than sex. My ex and I talked about it before, he wanted to try it. I thought it was gross and didn't think it would feel good. At some point we were fooling around and he was eating me out while I was face down on the bed with my butt kinda sticking out a bit. Well he went from front to back and then just spent some time there. I read through some of the comments in here and it seems like people tried to stick their tongues in the butthole, but he just kinda licked and kissed softly. And his hands would be on my ass too, caressing. My goodness, I usually moan a little when he goes down on me but this was different. I felt paralyzed, couldn't move a muscle, and just lay there quietly, feeling every stroke of his tongue on my bum. He asked me if I liked it, because I was so quiet he didn't get any feedback, and since he pulled his face away from my ass to ask the question, I was able to mumble out a ""yes"" and forced myself to nod. The first time was the best, there was nothing like that feeling ever again, but all those other times are pretty damn good too. I'm sopping wet afterwards and nothing gets me more relaxed and ready for sex than that. It's like muscles I don't know I had get relaxed and I feel like I'm an overcooked spaghetti. I fucking love it."
"I’m a very sexual person who is into bdsm and swinging, but I hate porn and I’ve never been turned on by it and don’t watch it. This always shocks people. "
"I hate it when people make sexist/racist/etc jokes when they're only doing it because they're trying to upset someone, and then getting annoyed when someone gets offended. It's not that people can't take a joke, it's that you're obviously just being an asshole on purpose because you WANT to upset people. "
"Back in high school my best friend asked me out and his response was “Thank you for being honest with me, and if it isn’t weird for you I would like to remain friends.”

"Still waiting, and I'm 26."
"Freshman year roommate was cool at first but (im black) her boyfriend was racist but didn't think he was because he was like ""well i havent killed you in your sleep yet so how can i be racist"" (i wish i was kidding). He ALWAYS had a knife with him and talked about guns constantly. Then theyd have sex when i was in the room (super luck we got one of the largest rooms on campus completely by luck so our beds weren't super close) thinking i couldn't hear. It was also weird bc he failed his senior year of high school so he was still in high school but he'd be around in the middle of the day. (She grew up close to the college) I talked to her about it and she got super defensive about him and got more aggressive and obnoxious. so....i became obnoxious.  We had suitemates and first they were on her side and then they realized oh shit this guy might kill us and they saw my side so it was 3 v 1. He came around a lot less after that.

"Work people are not your friends. You can be friendly, form relationships and bonds, but this is your career and you need to safeguard it.

Don't tell anyone anything you wouldn't be able to defend if it was written on a billboard, and for sure never put it in an email. If you aren't sure if you should say something personal at work, do not say it. Everything you say can and will be used against you by someone looking to get ahead. Be that person that never says anything bad about someone even if it is justified.

I say this as someone who currently has great working relationships with my coworkers. It is a great work environment, we like to spend time together at work/on lunch, we feel supported, but they are not friends. I learned in my first office the hard way what can happen (not me but some coworkers). You like to believe the best of people, but it is better to save those close friendships for outside of work. You dedicated a lot of time to your education/career and it is a sad reality that office politics are not always fair.

"I never wanted bio kids because pregnancy scares me more than I can say, and I didn't want to risk permanently ruining my body. But, I do like community and want to better the world, so... I fostered. It wasn't that I ""changed my mind"" exactly about having kids, it was the situation was right, at the right time. Got to forgo pregnancy, skip diapers and potty training, and instead hang out with awesome teenagers. I'd foster again, it's the best of both worlds for me"
"A year and a half ago I was traveling in Europe with friends. My SO was at home in the states taking care of life and such. I was at a castle, the view was amazing, and I thought to myself ""I wish my husband was here with me to experience it.""

Youtube battle. Most people have seen their fair share of videos throughout the years that have either made them laugh their assess off or had an impact on them. Sharing these videos with each other is an easy way to get to know each other. Especially if you start going down the music route! 
"One of my dealbreakers, after being married to a sports fanatic for 18 years was that I would never date someone who was really into sports. My current bf is a professional sports bettor, so as you can imagine, he watches sports constantly. The difference is that he doesn’t let it dictate our lives like my ex-husband did. If I want to do something or watch something else, he is always willing to oblige. "
"&gt; how do you keep the anxiety of it happening in your new relationships away?

She cheated on me with like a half dozen people, but I never developed anxiety afterward. Instead, I developed self-respect and an ability to walk away from toxic people. As painful as the 3 years with her were, in the end, she made me emotionally both stronger and more mature."
"Things this doctor did:

Blamed me for ""putting myself in the position"" of being raped the second time. 

Invited my mother to look inside of my vagina without asking me

Threatened me by saying that if I didn't get an IUD that she was pushing on me, she wasn't going to help me with my chronic pain, and no one else was either. 

Invited other doctors to look at my vagina without asking me

Repeatedly subjected me to unnecessary and traumatic tests

Made a joke about ""forcing"" herself into my vagina in order to insert the IUD (which she then did despite my screaming)

Told me to get over the pain afterwards

Made several inappropriate comments about me bearing children

Altered the IUD because she had heard that the strings were uncomfortable for men"

"One time some tinder guy messaged my roommate, saying that he was rushing for a frat and he needed a picture of a girl's boobs or butt with his name and the frat's name on it. Obviously my roomie wasn't gonna do it, but we called in a male friend who wasn't camera shy and wrote it on his butt, then took the picture with some clever lighting and camera angles to obscure the shape and hairyness. 

Tinder guy was unhappy with the follow up picture, featuring the clearly male friend mooning the camera and my roommate standing next to him with a shit eating grin. "

"We actually only found out about this whole debacle because my stubborn (but amazing) roommate was adamant about wearing a pair of sandals for a girls night out before school began again and couldn't find them. When she asked on our group chat, crazy lady admitted to ""borrowing them and other things for her trip""....which led us 4 original housemates to thoroughly inventory our belongings and find a number of things missing.

When we confronted her about the whole thing she simply said ""girls, *don't worry*, I was going to wash everything before returning it"""

"I've done it a couple of times. Jeans will catch it too, it's just not really that comfortable.

Sometimes I wear skirts and dresses with nothing under them. I don't get discharge everywhere, but sometimes it does end up high on my inner thighs if it's that ovulation time.

Basically, you notice it more when it's ok your underwear in my experience."
"I used to do alterations for my local dry cleaner. 
A woman dropped off her dress pants to have a hole repaired, which was near the zipper. 

I fixed the hole, and then noticed something reddish whitish on my sewing machine. I didn’t think too much of it until I started to clean it. 

The disgusting stuff on my machine was vaginal discharge from those dress pants. 

I cleaned my sewing machine with alcohol. I charged her $25 for a $5 repair. And I informed the owners of the dry cleaners that they are never to accept clothing for repair only, because that was a putrid experience. "
"When I was 22 and stupid, I cheated on my boyfriend (the only person I had previously ever been with). I came clean the next day and broke up with him, telling him he deserved way better than me and that I would never forgive myself.  That was over a decade ago and I will never cheat again. That’s not the person I want to continue to be. I can’t change what I did back then, but I can at least try to be a better person now."
I have a lower tolerance for shady behavior and I'm much more willing to walk away and not tolerate bullshit after being cheated on. I set standards for how I expect to be treated and I enforce them.
"This sounds so dumb but on our first date. We stayed at the restaurant, talking until they closed. Then went outside and talked and talked and all the sudden it was like 2am and we'd just been shooting the breeze that whole time (7 hours). I knew then that I needed him in my life forever. That was almost 4 years ago and we're still together"
"We're still married, but the relationship is definitely strained, sometimes worse than other times. Since I got so sick during/after the pregnancy, I had to give up my job and I'm a stay-at-home-mom. I do the majority of the housework, which I understand is my ""job"" now, but I feel like I'm raising 2 kids. I have to nag my husband continuously to get him to do anything. He won't even throw his garbage in the garbage - he'll leave food wrappers laying on counters, tables, his desk, etc. He'll wall past things that need cleaning or putting away as if he expects me to take full responsibility for all the chores in the house.

My husband mostly takes care of our son on weekends, but that's usually to free up my time so I can do other chores like laundry and cleaning. The thing that makes me angriest though is that my husband doesn't really play with our son. He'll just let him play with his toys while my husband ignores him and plays video games. It infuriates me because for someone who wanted a child so bad and pressured me into something I didn't want to do, he doesn't seem to take much interest in our son.

My husband's not all bad, he does support me and helps me with my mental health issues... But I feel like I wouldn't be this sick in the first place if he didn't pressure me into getting pregnant."
I had a man explain to me that it was not possible that I could remember the birth of my child because women's bodies produce hormones that make them forget any pain. 
"I had a friend like this. She used to be a fun, liberal, loving person. She's a completely different person now. Now she is a bible-thumping bigot.

So she was selfish and changed too much, and now we no longer speak."

"I once had a psychiatrist who brushed me off so, so hard. Every time I'd go in (and I had no choice as he was literally the only psych in my area that took my insurance) he'd talk to me about how my mental illness, which I have detailed in a comment on this subreddit recently, was all due to ""female stuff"". Whenever my symptoms happened a week before my period? PMS. A week after? Hormones still out of whack. During period? Obviously this is a feminine issue! So apparently there is only one week out of a month that I am able to feel bad and have it be something *other* than ~ladypart stuff~, lol. He also kept on telling me that I needed to lose weight because ""don't you want babies soon?"" I was glad once I got out of that hellhole of a town

e: I guess I should say that he actually ended up prescribing the medication I am still on to this day, after years, but it sucks to have your symptoms be brushed off as ""feminine issues"" no matter what. He pushed really, really hard for me to get my lady organs checked out all the time despite me already establishing that I had PCOS. And no, the symptoms I was experiencing don't go hand in hand with PCOS or any other ""feminine issue"", really"
"That you should wash your vagina (like, on the inside) when that is actually a great way to ruin your natural vaginal flora and open yourself up for nasty infections."
"physically pushed me, spilled my drink on me, and said ""what the fuck you nasty bitch. If I had wanted to talk to you, I would have. If I wanted to ask you out, I would have. If a man doesn't approach you, assume it's because he doesn't have any interest in interacting with you and that he doesn't find you attractive enough to be worth his time. Don't be so desperate and pathetic, men don't like women who are easy"" 

Simply because we were at a bar with a bunch of mutual friends, met a new guy there and I asked if he wanted to go grab drinks again sometimes"
"Well, ""smooth"" is a big word, but I got let down quite elegantly by a friend. He just said ""hey, I think you're a really good person, but I don't really see you like that. Hope we can stay friends though!""

I had no hard feelings and we actually stayed friends (not very close or anything, but friends nonetheless)"
"I am the exact opposite of that: no visible tattoos when I'm wearing work clothes (aside from one on my left hand that no one really notices), I keep to myself, I'm good at my job, and I try to help out my co-workers if I can. People at my job think I'm really wholesome but I have a history of partying HARD and probably still would if my partner didn't start pulling me out of party mode a few years ago. They also think that I'm in my early 20's for some reason, and I'll be 33 in a month. A co-worker of mine was SHOCKED that I'm an atheist. His response was, ""But you're so... NICE!"" I realize that his reaction has more to do with his notions about how he thinks people of certain beliefs act and not anything to really do with me but that's whole other conversation. Anyway, short story, I look like a sweet baby but I'm a godless party monster."

I asked her what she meant and she replied ""am I not your girlfriend?"" To which I replied ""I don't know, are you my girlfriend?"" She then said ""I don't know, you'll have to ask me properly!""

This melted my heart and we've been together for a LONG time now. Still love her to pieces :) "
Indigenous person chiming in: I’m in Canada and we also generally think that white people don’t season their food or cook very well. I think it’s a pretty common stereotype for white folks across different communities of colour 
Babies. I don't find them cute at all. 
"Cooking is an awesome life-skill that impacts your social, financial and physical health, and being unwilling to learn how to do so significantly devalues said person as a functional human being."
"It is very important, even a dealbreaker for many people, especially if it is forced and at the start of a relationship. People need space to decompress, to balance themselves, to have some time where they are alone and do things however they want to whenever they want to. That is why it is very important in live-in situations as well as marriages to have both alone-alone time, as well as together-alone time. 

Emotional space is equally important. Absence makes the heart grow fonder - give the other person time and a chance to miss you. "
Vladimir Computin
"For a long time, I was paranoid in all my relationships. This really damaged my relationships. It was increasingly difficult because I was cheated on by multiple people, so some of those relationships I was paranoid about *did* end with cheating, which reinforced my paranoia. I also have diagnosed anxiety and this problem was causing big issues with my mental health.

Then one day, after breaking up with a guy who had cheated yet again, I realized a few things all at once.

1. If someone is going to cheat on me and/or break up with me, then that is their choice and no matter how much worrying I do, I won’t be able to prevent that from happening. It’s just not my decision to make. If I’m going to be with someone, I need to trust that they will make the right choices. Sitting home biting my fingernails over what they might be out doing won’t change anything. Realizing that it was out of my control weirdly made it easier not to worry about it. I decided I was going to try to be happy and enjoy my life and if other people made decisions that hurt me then I would deal with it then, but I wouldn’t *assume* they were going to make those decisions.

2. It is not fair to punish someone for something that they didn’t do. Punishing a current SO because a former SO cheated is absolutely not okay. It’s not fair to refuse to trust someone I’m with just because a different person who has nothing to do with them decided to do something awful. It’s difficult to separate what happened in one relationship from your ideas of what will happen in the next relationship, but it’s important to realize that they are separate, individual relationships with two different people. 

3. I kept getting cheated on in part because I was choosing the wrong types of guys. I was bending my personal rules and ignoring my dealbreakers because I was afraid to be alone. I was a serial monogamist and I kept jumping from one relationship to another because I hate to be single. I ignored that one guy had cheated on his ex even though I always say I won’t date cheaters. I ignored that one guy had anger management problems. I ignored all these things that I *shouldn’t* have ignored, all in the name of being in a relationship. I was dating blatantly untrustworthy guys and then I was shocked when they weren’t trustworthy. 

So I made some choices. I decided I wasn’t going to settle for lower than my standards and I was not going to cave on my dealbreakers, even if it meant being single for the rest of my damn life. I decided I would give the next guy a real chance to earn my trust. And I decided that I would communicate from the very beginning what my boundaries in the relationship were and that I would leave if those boundaries were crossed. 

After that I met my current SO, and he was everything I wanted and more. I gave him a real chance, and he proved to me time and time again that he was trustworthy. He is never secretive, he is never disrespectful, he is always kind and loving. He’s the hottest guy I’ve ever met and other girls have tried to get with him, but he always turns them down immediately. We’ve been together for a few years now and we live together, and he is still constantly showing me that he loves me and that he’s loyal to me. I trust him wholeheartedly. "
"THIIIIIIS. Every ""male feminist"" I know is a super great ally when it's only women around but the second one of his bros starts in with some sexist bullshit (examples: calling girls sluts/whores/making stupid jokes) they stay silent or even worse, laugh along because they're too afraid of confrontation. I have never met a man who didn't do this and it makes it reaaaaally hard for me to trust the legitimacy of ""male feminists"" and allies. Call out your bros and friends, men. Call them out and make them feel stupid and uncomfortable when they say gross, sexist shit, because you know damn well if a woman did it we'd be a ""bitch"" or ""feminazi."" Most men only listen to other men, so take advantage of that platform. "

"I lived with roommates for the first time when I was 24. I decided on this newly renovated appartment with two 50-some year old women (friends, not partners) because they would be quiet and responsible and there wouldn’t be any drama. You know, usually 50 year olds should have their life together right?

We were all moving in at the same time, which is totally fine. Everyone had their own furniture for their room, and the two ladies would take care of the common area furniture (the lease was theirs. I was just a roommate). 

Turns out one of them was dirt poor and hadn’t told her “friend”. I say “friend” because I found out later that they only knew each other for a month before deciding to sign a lease together. This meant that there was barely any furniture in the common areas for a while because they couldn’t agree on a price to pay for everything. I ended up forking some dough because I was sick of not having furniture. 

Then there’s the pet situation. 

First of all, roommate 1 (r1) had 5 cats. FIVE! She told me three when I visited at first and somehow acquired two more before we moved in. A month or two in, her cousin got ill so she took hers and then had 6 cats. 

Roommate 2 (r2) had an old dog she had adopted recently and she didn’t have enough money to go to the vet so he had so many problems and smelled really bad. She expected us to walk him when she wasn’t there and threw fits if we didn’t , but he had a problem with his rectum and couldn’t poop properly; this meant that we had to “hold” his butt while he was pooping. I love dogs but I am not going to do that ever. 

R2 was absolutely batshit . We think she had a personality disorder or was bipolar. She would do really weird things and throw plates and scream at r1. I would hide out in my room when this happened. I felt like I was in a dysfunctional family and I was their teenager. 

At one point, one of the cats pooped on the bathroom mat so instead of being a normal adult and either a) cleaning it up, b) putting it outside or c) leaving it there for R1 to clean up herself (she had the cats), R2 took the poopy matt and put it on R1s bed. That’s just really gross and disrespectful and really passive aggressive. 


She finally got a job a month or so in. We were really happy for her and she was going to be a life coach. She would talk about it day and night until one day she asks if she can host a group meeting at our place and if we could attend. Trying to be supportive, we said sure. It turns ou I couldn’t go though, but R1 filled me in. It was actually a free meeting to entice people to take her service so that they can themselves become a life coach, who will in turn (you guessed it), recruit more life coaches! This woman was in a freakin pyramid scheme and didn’t know it. And she didn’t even make any money for the time she was a life coach while I lived in the appartment. 

We also had two foreign exchange students staying with us so that R1 and R2 could make extra money. This was totally fine with me because they were quiet and so was I. It turns out that R2 was making both of them really uncomfortable (I can’t remember why) and when the exchange was done and the students went back home, they told their parents and the parents made a formal complaint. R1 and R2 were no longer allowed to have échange students at their home. R2 was (for some fucked up reason) under the impression that she was entitled to all the money that came from the foreign exchange students because she didn’t have a job (????) and so she was really angry and blamed everyone else when the complaint clearly stated it was her fault. 

When I had enough, I gave my 30 days notice (in regulation with my contract with R1 and R2) and moved two blocks away into another apartment with roommates. I kept talking to R1 because she was really chill, but R2 started going crazy against me too. She sent me texts saying that her fights with R1 were my fault and that I was a giant slut (I was poly at the time and very open about it with my roommates) and that I was the crazy one and that everyone was always against her. 

I also had lent some furniture to R2 for the exchange students because R2 didn’t have enough money to buy any. When I left, I gave her a list of the furniture that belongs to me and the price I would sell them if she wanted to keep them (it was very clear from the start that I was lending her the furniture). She went ape shit because she felt I should give them to her. 

I had left stuff at the appartment with R1 and R2 when I moved out and I was going to pick them up but I didn’t have a lot of time on my hands. So one day while I was home in my new appartment(she didn’t know I was home) she dropped off a box of my things (which had my grandmothers dining plates in them), opened the box and started chucking plates at my front porch. Then 15 minute later she came back with a broom and a garbage bag and picked up all the shards on the sidewalk. It was a really weird thing to witness from my bedroom window. 

**tl;dr** I roomed with two 50 year old “friends” thinking it would be quiet and drama-free only to be sorely disappointed. "
"My best friend is in a relationship with a man that gives her so little thought that he *forgot to buy her a Christmas present.* 

They live together and had their third anniversary in September.  He bought everyone else in his life thoughtful, expensive (!) presents. He just...forgot her. He told her that, the day before Christmas. She had the perfect gift under the tree for him and he came clean and told her that he hadn't remembered to buy her a gift, and suggested that she make an Amazon list. I hate him so much for making her feel so insignificant, but she loves him still."

"I feel like my meds (Prozac) reduced my symptoms by around 30 percent.  Now I have the energy to do therapy, CBT, make positive changes in my life etc so then I expect that as I do those things, the symptoms will reduce further.



I'm on Prozac.  It really helped my mind get quieter.  All of a sudden I had room in my brain to think of better things."
"Buying ""fast fashion"" brands. I try to make conscious and ethical choices in other areas of my life and in other things I buy like food and homeware, but fast fashion is my vice. Also I'm not sure what other people are doing to their clothes, but I haven't had any fast fashion pieces ""fall apart"" very quickly like people say they do, and I even machine wash them. "
"I became good friends with a classmate and both of our leases were ending. She persuaded me to move in and share the 1 bedroom apt with her. She was nice and we got along so I thought we could overcome the “don’t live with your friends” stigma... 
I learned she rarely showered, like once a week even if she was on her period. She rarely did laundry, just sprayed febreeze. I knew she smoked weed but she said she smoked occassionally. I’ve occasionally (like 2x a week) walked into the entire apt hall reeking of weed and opening the door to see a group of people smoking. She had a guy she insisted wasn’t her bf but they definitely weren’t just friends... I’ve gone into my apt in random times like if I forgot something and found him just walking around by himself. If I presented something in our classes, she would crtique me afterwards when we’re both in the apt. Her parents sent her $1000/month to spend (and paid for her rent) because they thought she was always studying. She complained about not having enough money but refused to get a part-time job in retail or whatever every other college student worked in because she thought they were beneath her. I ended up kicking out her boytoy after I caught him coming out from my area when he was in the apt alone and we fought. I moved out and we don’t talk anymore lol."
I think it’s just a round about way to say they support your mixed race relationship in a world where some people still are strongly against it.  I’m Asian and my husband is white and many of my cousins and nephews are mixed babies and I’ve always thought they were the cutest babies ever growing up.  Try not to worry about it. 
"Learn a skill or do a craft together. My fiancé and I aren’t terribly artistically inclined, but we like to go to craft stores and get packaged projects to do. We made a mosaic stepping stone, painted coffee cups, and etched beer mugs and wine glasses. I taught him how to crochet once, and we both tried sewing together. "
"None. I’ve heard problematic things from black people about me dating outside my race, but it’s never been judgmental.

To be honest the question rubs me the wrong way as it is now phrased because it ignores the plurality within the black *communities* and assumes a common hostility against interracial dating. That has not been my experience.

*My* experience* has been interracial dating upsets African Americans the most, especially if they are from the south, west coast, or older generation. They are more likely to talk about it as a “race betrayal” thing with historical roots.

In contrast, Caribbean black people don’t give af because we don’t have the same history and we don’t see ourselves as a collective that clearly (thus not as much to “betray”). Interracial couples are a dime a dozen, especially in the UK, and some of us actually encourage it (often for all the wrong reasons, but I digress). If people notice a problem they talk about it from the colorism angle.

With Africans, it depends on where they come from and how strong they feel about ethnicity. Some groups like Somalis insist on marrying in, so interracial marriage is a disgrace by default. On the other hand, if you’re going to marry out, it might be better marrying interracial than marrying another black person from an “inferior” ethnic group or an ethnic group with a tense history.

For those reasons, the question would be better phrased as “have you had experiences with judgement and criticism from the black community” because it assumes the possibility of diverse experiences.

"I was at a work conference and I was standing at the elevator waiting for it to arrive. I had pushed the button, it lit up, but the elevator was going really slowly. Immediately after the button light went off (it was one of those that takes forever for the doors to open after it’s arrived), a man walked around the corner. He saw me waiting and reached around me to push the button again while saying, “You have to push the button to call the elevator.” Of course just as he goes to push it, it opens, and he thinks he’s saved the day.

Ended up having a ""real wedding"" a year later with family and friends in attendance. In Vegas."

He straight up did hot know what Grey Jedi were. I laughed, linked him a Wiki page about Grey Jedi, and asked him why, out of a thread FULL of men talking about Grey Jedi, did he choose to assume I didn't know anything about Star Wars and begin lecturing me? He deleted his comment and then sent me a PM telling me to kill myself lol.

Also, makeup and women's fashion. Trying to tell me what's actually stylish or well-done. I always laugh because they're ALWAYS wrong, they never know the trends, and they will likely *never* know more about makeup or women's fashion than I do. They have no idea what true artistry looks like but still think they can explain it to me lol."

"Don't turn a blind eye. When you see another guy being inappropriate, call him out. A lot of creeps continue doing what they do because they know they can get away with it. Don't let them. Embarrass them. Call attention to their behavior. Unless doing so would endanger you, of course. 

And when a friend, male or female, confides in you about sexual harassment or assault - let them know that you believe them. Even if you're suspicious, even if you have questions or doubts. This isn't the time or the place for that. This also isn't the time to question their interpretation of what happened or speak to the perpetrator's intentions.  It's not your place to tell them ""well I'm sure he didn't mean it that way"" or ""maybe he misunderstood"" or ""it was probably an accident."" I know you're trying to be reassuring but it doesn't help. "

"See also, that to cure acne *all* you have to do is wash your face. Generally with the harshest skincare on the market.

My niece hit some pretty gnarly hormonal acne during puberty, it runs in her family apparently. We get to chatting because I'm one of her few aunts (very male-heavy family, her mother isn't in the picture), she starts complaining about her spots because they hurt like hell and nothing's working. I ask her what she's currently using and, *guys*.

Both her grandmothers were the ""you get acne from not washing your face enough"" type, and both had bought her the works; clearasil face wash, *St. Ives apricot scrub*, and a whole host of other super harsh, very foamy cleansers. No treatments, *no moisturisers* because they told her ""young skin doesn't need moisture, also the oils will make you break out worse"".

It was the grandma who is my MiL that pissed me off most; I'm a trained cosmetologist. She knows this. I could have hooked that girl *up*. Now she has pigmentation scars that she used *AHAs* on, in the height of summer (for those not skincare nerdy, basically her skin is hella damaged and will need *expensive AF* treatments to remove if she so wishes). All could have been avoided if my MiL who hates me had put her ego aside to help her granddaughter out.

(For those cringing in horror; she has been taught about SPF, salicylic acid, niacinamide, moisturisers and Korean BB creams - girl loves them because she's not terribly into makeup but hates looking at the red breakouts. Acne is mostly controlled except for monthly blips but she's not in pain anymore which is what she wants!)"
My friend was involved with a married military guy (whose wife was also in the military...big no no in itself).  She thought she desperately loved him.  Did anything for him.  Believed his lies.  When he got posted out west she considered going too.  He kept messaging her.  Stringing her along.  Then he accidentally messaged her details of an upcoming trip instead of his other mistress.  She then wanted to get him to give her his sperm so she could gave a baby but he wouldn't have to be involved.   Thankfully she finally woke up.  
"The ""right partner"" thing was the most annoying part to me, by far. Like, I'm just so misguided on my own, and my silly little lady brain just needed the right guy to court me and help me see what I need for my future. Nah, the ""right guy"" is, shockingly, someone I'm compatible with"
"Thank you for sharing this. I’m 33 and I’m iffy about having kids. Sometimes I wonder if when I was younger and talked about having kids, if it was done because that’s what’s expected in my family/culture not because I necessarily wanted them. I’ve struggled with depression my whole life and when people talk about having kids, it’s always sunshine and rainbows. When I ask my friends about their experiences they never say the things you mention, which are the concerns I have *should* I have a kid and it makes me feel like a horrible person."
"Structuring your time is so important. Make a routine and stick to it. Include some time where you get out of the house each day, even if it’s just to take a walk for half an hour.

Keep daytime hours. Don’t let yourself become one of those people who sleeps until 2pm and stays up until 4am. It’s really isolating and also makes it harder to interview and generally transition back to the working world.

Get a notepad or small whiteboard and write small tasks on it that you can accomplish every day. This is good not only for morale, but to have something to say when someone inevitably asks what you did with your time. These should be small tasks, not big ones. Instead of writing, “Clean house” or “Do laundry” it should be things like “Vacuum main floor” or “Scrub bathtub” or “Wash and dry darks”. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when you’re stressed, so you want to set small goals that you can accomplish easily. It is as much a mental exercise as it is making sure you don’t let things slide.

**IGNORE THE AVALANCHE OF UNBELIEVABLY BAD JOB-SEEKING ADVICE** 

This is probably the hardest. You’ll have people who should fucking know better tell you things like “You should be spending 8 hours a day looking for a job”, or that you should be looking in the classified ads in the print version of the newspaper, or that you should just print out a bunch of resumes and refuse to leave the lobby of some office without talking to the manager, or other horsecrap that hasn’t worked since 1987. Ignore people who tell you that you should get a job flipping burgers, as if those jobs are just handed out for the asking. Ignore people who tell you that you should offer to work for free at a job that should ordinarily pay a wage. Just ignore everyone who has advice that you haven’t expressly asked for.

Some do’s:

Make multiple versions of your resume and cover letter, so they can easily be customized to the specific job you’re applying for. Let’s say you have experience in sales, office programs, and coding, so make a resume that highlights your sales experience, one for your office experience, and one for your coding experience.

Make a list of the companies you’ve applied to, which resume you used, and when you sent your application. This is particularly useful if you’re sending out a lot of apps and you forget what position was at which company. (It happens.)

Go to resume-polishing workshops or ask any people you know who have professional copywriting expertise.

Polish your LinkedIn profile and join some professional groups. Mention in your profile that you’re looking for opportunities in XYZ field.

Go through all your social media and purge it of every questionable thing that an employer could possibly take offense at. Pictures of you with a drink in your hand, discussions on the legalization of marijuana, posts where you call Trump a shitbag—get rid of all of it. As far as social media is concerned, you live the most G-rated Mr. Rogers life imaginable. (And it’s not a bad idea to keep your social media that way.)

Exercise multiple times a week. It’s good for your health, your mood, your stress levels, and it kills some time. 

Make a list of cheap/free things to do. Free museum days, free sample day at Costco, free local festivals. Goodwill, the $1 rack at the used bookstore, classes at the library. You’ll feel better about your life if you feel like having to pinch pennies doesn’t cut you off from enjoying things other people enjoy. As an added bonus, when you do get another job, you have more disposable income because you’re not compelled to spend it on stuff that costs money.

Due to the holidays and the new year, people are going through their homes and getting rid of tons of stuff to donate. If you need work/interview clothes, or whatever, now is a great time to hit up the thrift stores and get some deals.

Make a plan to re-read all the books you own, re-watch all the movies you own, write all your legislators, take up a hobby you’ve always wanted to try, whatever you *really enjoy* doing. Do you really like naps? Take the best naps. Do you enjoy baking? Find some new recipes and give them a try. Always wanted to learn more about a given historical period? Head to the library and spend some time paging through some books. 

So, typical day:

Wake up at Reasonable o’clock. Make a list of 10 things you want to do that day. Spend an hour going through all your job searches, apply and write cover letters. Make notes on which companies and positions you applied for. Then hit the gym/leave the house for a while. Come back and knock out all your other list items. Then spend at least an hour doing whatever you *really enjoy* doing.

The key to all this is that you can look back on each day, see that you accomplished things, see that you’re on top of your job search, and you can list at least one thing that you get to do that really makes you happy. I don’t have to tell you that being unemployed is extremely stressful, especially when people pile on with terrible advice and blame, and acting like it’s your fault if you don’t get hired for jobs with 20 other candidates in the interview pool. If you can look back at your day and say, “I am accomplishing things, taking care of myself, and I still get to do stuff that makes me happy,” it will keep you sane and help you manage your stress a lot better."
“FBI Surveillance Van” was a funny one I’ve seen
"My brother is becoming more and more of an extremist Muslim and starts preaching every now and then and doesn’t forget to remind me that I am a female and shouldn’t compete with males ( wanting my brothers to share house chores responsibility and going out with friends is one of those). 
So what works for us is not to talk about woman roles or religion although he can’t avoid but he is also tired of verbal fights and knows he is not gonna have his way with me. So I remind him that it’s gonna end in fight every time I notice that we are going downhill so he stops or I walk away. "

"This is my answer from the askmen thread.

It was completely unintentional but I still feel really bad.

While two of my kids were in their karate class a little boy asked me if I breastfed my infant son. I told him I did. He ask me how the milk actually came out of my boobs. I'm all for answering honestly and if I had known him better I would have but I didn't. So I told him to ask his mom. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly and said that his mom had died two months before. I felt awful and panicked and suggested he could ask his dad. At which point he then, still squeezing his eyes shut, put his head down and explained how his dad was in jail and he wasn't allowed to see him.

I know there is no way I could have known but I felt absolutely horrible. That poor kid was clearly in pain because of me. Thankfully his grandmother saw him and came over to distract him. I told her later what happened and she told me it was all okay. I still feel terrible. I now just explain how nipples work to kids. "
"I was 15, and had on great tasting chapstick and a crush on one of my female friends.

"Some signs that a man is mature includes:

* He doesn't live with his parents, and doesn't rely on other people to do his cooking, cleaning and laundry. If he is healthy and able, he has a full-time job or is studying. 

* He has developed emotional intelligence and good communication skills - he can listen without offering unsolicited advice. He is willing to get help and see a therapist if needed.

* He is respectful of boundaries, and doesn't keep pursuing women romantically after they turn him down - nor does he get angry or rude if a woman turns him down.

* He is close friends with other men, who he trusts and respects - he doesn't rely on his girlfriend or wife for all his social and emotional needs.

* He is secure in his masculinity, and doesn't have something to prove. He isn't afraid of looking girly or feminine."

Surrounding myself with positive people. It’s so much easier to have a positive outlook on life and situations when others surrounding you do the same 
When I was in labor I started crying just from overwhelming emotion and the nurse scoffed and said “why are you crying?”  She tried over 5 times to get a needle in my vein unsuccessfully and then proceeded to drop the needles and supplies all on the floor. She then disappeared and didn’t return despite me pressing the emergency button over and over and over. We had to find an off duty nurse who just happened by to deliver my child. My nurse came wondering in about 20min after delivery saying she was just checking on me and going home now. 
"""Oh, that's cool."" Followed by a massive smile and a high-five.

The high-five was my favourite part."
"100%. This. When I don't wear underwear I feel fine, when I wear underwear I feel like there is way more discharge. I haven't worn panties (except sexy) for almost 20 years. Represent."
"The one about a presidential candidate colluding with former KGB in order to get elected. The Russians then hired countless people to flood the internet with false flag comments, promote fake stories in the news, and praise the campaign and everyone involved in it. They also hired hackers to break into the oppositions emails. All of this takes place over months (and years) The candidate gets elected and even congress is in on the game and refuses to investigate. Like, it's one of those things that goes all the way to the top with worldwide implications. On par with the Illuminati if you ask me. "
Staying home watching Black Mirror with my SO
"Knew her from freshman year, she smoked pot occasionally, I agreed to sign a lease with her after her promising she was done using drugs. A year later, she was dating a heroine dealer, selling pills and pot from her room, constantly leaving the doors unlocked so buyers could come and get what they wanted if she wasn't home, smoking where the whole house stunk, leaving the windows open to air it out but blaming my communal 18 cent/hour (I did the math) space heater on the $300 electric bill.  I learned from my security camera (installed for keeping an eye on my new dog before any of the problems started) that she locked my dog out of the house, thankfully it was smart enough to wait by the back door until I got home and let her in, planted pills in my laundry so it would be in my locked room if I called the cops, was using her and her friends' vaginas to mule drugs around campus, would throw drug-fueled parties literally every time that I left the house for a weekend or holiday, and would allow her fucked up friends to wallow on my brand new couch and love seat if she wasn't using it to fuck her girlfriend on. Filed a complaint with the landlord and cops who basically told me that they would have to catch her in the act and that video evidence was worthless. 
I so wish any bit of this was made up. That was only one year, mainly all in one semester."
"I second this. I have eczema and if I shower everyday, I will have rashes all over my body. So I do every other day. During the winter months I might push it every 3rd day depending how gross I feel I am. "
Periods. I made a joke about how when my period is late I've worried about being a pregnant virgin or something and a guy felt the need to explain to me why that isn't possible.
who the hell can wait until *after* breakfast to brush their teeth?  I feel like my mouth is begging for it the minute I roll out of bed
"Some dude once straight up gave me his umbrella when it was raining one day. I had a hooded raincoat on anyway and it was totally unnecessary. I tried to refuse it and he insisted I take it, then when I wouldn't, he just threw it at the floor towards me and sprinted off. It was super weird.

But what was even weirder was the same thing happened a week later with another man! A guy walked up to me with his umbrella, holding it out to share, I thanked him and we chatted for a bit and then when we had to part ways, he told me to take his umbrella, handed it to me and ran off."

Liberal feminist. Believe strongly in women’s rights but I’m really turned off by radical feminism. I think gender is something that needs to be understood properly not something that needs to be eradicated. I believe men and women are different on average and an equitable future doesn’t mean women and men have to be the same.

"I'm gonna go with silly, not serious:  
  
a) fresh coffee is the best smell in the entire world, including flowers and perfume and fresh bread. If someone could bottle a man's cologne that smelled like fresh coffee I would never not want to attack him.  
  
b) James Franco is secretly a psychopath. You will never convince me he isn't a nutcase. I feel similarly about Jared Leto, there is something about both of them (the eyes) that screams ""no stay away from me"".  
  
c) Frank's Hot Sauce makes any food disgusting.  
  
d) Kraft Cheese Singles are not edible. They don't taste like *food*, and somehow people have been brainwashed into thinking they make ""the best"" grilled cheese.  
  
e) my sister in law steals my socks. I don't have any proof, BUT I'M ON TO YOU.  
  
f) J is the most attractive letter of the alphabet.  
  
g) hairless cats are pointless. Just get a rat or something.  
  
h) Pepsi is better than Coke. I have various mortal enemies floating around AW because of this issue already, but it just is. Coke is too... bite-y and harsh, I would rather have *no* drink than have Coke.  
  
h2) Pepsi is only good in a real glass, with ice. Plastic-bottled soft drinks of any kind are terrible and not refreshing.  
  
i) the Beatles were a boy band. Yes, I know, they played instruments so they weren't a ""boy band"" - except they totally were. They *set the standard* for 60s boy bands and beyond. Beatlemania, stadiums full of screaming, fainting teenage girls, marketing playing up the individual members to appeal to different girls, everything. They evolved, yep, but they started as poppy, cute, rockin' boys who made teen girls go crazy. "
"I'm not sure if this counts because it isn't what we all generally think of as extremist buuut...

One of my close friends from college has gotten *extremely* into astrology and the like. I don't give a shit what you believe for the most part but she cannot think outside the context of what planets are aligned or whatever, and it's gotten so bad that I cannot handle more than a 5 minute conversation with her.

I feel bad because she's a good person but it's like her personality is now in this little box!"
"I wish I'd kept my political opinions (you can generalise that to any sort of opinions that can cause strong disagreements) at bay at least until I'd gotten to know the people I worked with better the first day of my last job.

The story is that the morning I started that job, a bunch of very racist pamphlets from a right-wing extremist party in my country had been distributed to every mailbox in town. When I met my new co-workers, they were chatting while getting ready to work and one of them asked ""did you see that [insert name of right-wing extremist party] pamphlet?"". In passing, I said ""yeah, complete bullshit."" I thought nothing of it because my sheltered self had never met anyone who would agree with such statements. Turns out this co-worker does and she went on a rant about how she thinks they're right. This time I just held my tongue but the rapport with this co-worker had a bad start and it took us some time to respect each other.

I don't regret openly disagreeing with racism and right-wing extremist propaganda at all, but in hindsight I wish I hadn't done so on my very first day and before having an estimation of my co-workers.

EDIT: To clarify, I meant 'respect' on a professional level. As in, get along on a day-to-day basis. "
"Me too. It's so much work and it's so freaking expensive. It's stressful making sure I fill my days to the brim with stuff to do because I otherwise will feel like I'm wasting money and time. 

I went on a trip with a large group and we spent the better part of the day going in circles asking each other ""what do you want to do"" while watching tv. It was maddening. I have a tv at home. I didn't drive 4 hours and spend hundreds on lodging just to watch tv."

"Based on the conversations I've had lately with the men in my life, ask yourself if you are expressing more concern for the rapist than the victim. If so, stop talking and listen instead. 

Similarly, when a woman tells you a story about her experience with sexual harassment and assault, does your response begin ""That's true, but...""? If so, try saying instead: ""That's true."" No more is needed. "
"People simplify it in odd ways. Like ""its just boobs and dragons!!!"" Like of all reasons is that really why you like it? I love the show but breaking it down to dragons and fighting and sex doesn't do it justice or really provide an accurate summary of the show at all."
"Worst: about 15 yrs ago being denied an IUD by a NP because I wasn't in a committed monogamous relationship. And was super condescending about it. 

Best: a year ago when I went to get my tubes tied. Had a friend drop me off at the hospital at 7am. All the staff was super friendly and nice. They seemed a bit surprised I was on my own, but were cool with it. Super easy procedure. Recovered very quickly from the the anesthesia and the recovery nurse was surprised at how good I was feeling and kept trying to make me more comfortable even though I was fine. Different friend picked me up and was home by 1pm, took a nap and then felt fine afterwards. 10/10 would get a tubal from them again even though that's not possible. "

Him: What's your master's thesis about? 

Me: It's about the use of war metaphors in abortion rhetoric. *Proceeds to explain a minor argument in the paper to elaborate, probably about how the ""quiver full"" Bible passage in my text dehumanizes children and demonstrates that anti-abortion activism is primarily concerned with children as symbols of virility for men rather than sanctity of life.*

"When I was 17 I was having major, experimental hip surgery. I was really scared. I was a competitive athlete whose performance had been damaged by the pain, and I had been on heavy duty pain meds for quite a while- I needed the surgery.

But I was afraid that I would take too long to get back to it and would lose my scholarships for the next year, or that I wouldn't heal at all.

Since the surgery was experimental, there was no time frame for how long I would be out. The surgery was going to be in a teaching facility. Three surgeons (two flown in to assist) were operating with a team helping them and a few dozen residents and students observing. 

Before the surgery, every single person introduced themselves and told me their job. I remember a anesthesiologist nurse that came up and shook my hand, then gave me a hug. She told me that her only job for the whole time I was under was to make sure I was safe. She wasn't worried about the hip surgery, just if my vitals were good. She would take care of me.

I remember how much better I felt and have never forgotten that woman's face. "

"Financial security. He's a freelance illustrator, which can be good at times, but there are also periods where he doesn't get paid for weeks after completing a job, and I'm basically covering everything outside of his share of the very bare necessities. It caused a lot of issues at first because he was terrible at budgeting when we first met, but a friend of mine who works in finance sat me down and explained that I shouldn't write him off just because he hasn't learnt how to look after his money. Financial responsibility is a learned behaviour, it's not an inherent personality flaw. 

So I told him that I love him, but I can't afford to support 2 people, so he needs to be in a better place financially before I feel comfortable being in a relationship with him. He immediately picked up a part time job and started offering art commissions, and took some personal finance courses online. 

It still does my head in when he can't afford to help out more. But we have a lovely house, in a great community and have great friends, which is more than a lot of people in the world, so at the times when I feel frustrated that I can't always just spend money on luxury items like I could when I was single, I try to remember the ways in which we are very fortunate.

When I first met my fiancé, I was physically attracted to him, but couldn't get past the fact that he was religious (Muslim), even though he wasn't really gung ho about it. Eventually, I said ""fuck it"" and we started going out.

"The best wedding I ever went to was my cousin's. 

The reasons: It was a Punjabi-British/East Coast Canadian wedding. There were two days of ceremonial stuff and partying (one for his family, one for hers). Also, everyone got along really well even though the guest list was huge and from all over the world and most of us had never met. Both sets of parents are quite well-off so amazing food, open bar, and really nice venues. 

It was really neat to have a Punjabi party one night with banging Indian music, endless food, and men throwing money at the bride/groom SEEMINGLY FOREVER. And then the next night was all Celtic rock and Canadian one-hit-wonders and poutine and whisky until the early morn. Such a great way to spend a weekend."
"I don’t think any topic is automatically offensive. However, offensive jokes are really only funny (and therefore not really offensive) when they aren’t actually being made at the expense of the subject of the joke, but rather demonstrate what an asshole the person making the joke is.

"Worst treatment was when I went to get my bandage changed after I’d stupidly stood on a razor whilst showering. The bandage had been on longer than it should have been, but because my GP was closed over Easter weekend, I had no choice. 

Whilst I was sat in the chair, the nurse started (quite aggressively, imagine her just pulling at it) removing my bandage even though she could clearly see that my bandage was stuck to the wound. Due to the pain, I fainted and my mum had to quickly catch my head before I hit the corner of the nurse’s desk. Apparently the nurse was still talking to me whilst this was all happening, not realising that I’d fainted. 

Once she realised, she ran off to get me water and also to get something to help ease off the bandage more gently. Still cringe thinking of the pain..."

"I remember that there are guys in the same position as me, that the shallow and superficial ones aren't the only ones who exist and an average guy would probably be perfectly happy to have me (unless I'm an asshole, but that's a different issue). I look around me at all the completely normal or even objectively unattractive couples who are head over heels for each other and it serves as a reminder that beauty is not everything, not even close.

I accepted that I was average a long time ago. Most people are average. Even if it doesn't feel like it, chances are you are completely normal, and normal is absolutely fine. You don't have to be the best of the best to have a satisfying love life. We live in such a tremendously competitive climate right now that it can be hard to feel like average is good enough, in all parts of life really... but it is. I mean, people have been getting along as average and even below average since forever, clearly it is not that damning.

The only actual tip that I can give is to limit your social media usage. You don't even need to completely swear off of it, but just be conscientious of the media that you're consuming and the people you're surrounding yourself with. If you are constantly bombarding yourself with the structured public personalities of Instagram models and beauty gurus, or the popular girls at your school, then yeah... you are gonna feel like shit. *Anybody* would. It's up to you to put yourself in a healthier social climate. Only you can really decide what that looks like."

"The beautiful thing about physical attraction is how relative it is. There's also so many different types of attraction. So what you may envy in someone, someone else may find extreme unappealing.

When I find myself comparing myself to another woman, especially through the goggles of what I think the male eye sees, I focus on complimenting that trait I envy. If a woman has an amazing ass, I think about how much effort she put into obtaining her figure or how amazing her genes are. If a woman has a gorgeous laugh, I compliment it mentally and enjoy how contagious her happiness is.

Appreciate beauty without feeling like that beauty is a competition for yours. There's someone with an attraction for the things you don't like, and a disinterest for the things you envy.

Love yourself and appreciate the beauty within the world around you! ❤"
"Self-consciousness.  

Whenever I'm faced with the reality of who I am and where I'm at in my life it hits me pretty quick."
"I am going to preface this list in saying I am 58 and basically been there done that more than most people.  though this is a lot it does not cover everything that can cause issues but it does start conversations:
The List:
 
If you share my home and my bed and my life, you can expect the following from me.... (and I expect it from you, too):
 
 Enjoy spending time together and make time to spend together every day, even if we're just hanging out doing “nothing”.
 I will listen when you need to talk, even if I don’t care (or understand) what you're talking about.
 Hold you when you need to cry, even if it’s just hormonal.
 Make our relationship a priority (over friends, work, extended family or other life interests)
 Make joint decisions, taking into consideration whether the decisions are ‘good’ for our relationship or will somehow threaten it. 
 Take our partnership into consideration when making or changing plans.
 Accept your flaws and cherish your good qualities.
 Not assume you know what I want or what is best for you.  
  will ask you what you need or how I can help, instead of telling you what I'm going to do to improve your life.
 Be your biggest cheerleader and tell you and others how fantastic you are.
 Share my dreams and communicate my desires openly and honestly and try to remember you're not psychic. 
 Structure work time when possible to allow for as much uninterrupted ‘family time’ as possible, esp. on weekends.
 Enjoyment of physical intimacy on a frequent basis.
 I will establish daily rituals with you that remind you that you are important to me, such as kissing you goodbye and hello when you leave and return, and taking at least a few moments of ‘us’ time before getting out of bed in the morning and a few moments of ‘us’ time before going to sleep at night, even when I'm in a hurry, or exhausted.
 I will answer the phone, every time you call, just in case you need me for something.
 I will check in” with you daily and keep you apprised of my schedule schedule, both daily and longer range, so that you know what to expect and can plan accordingly.  I'll update you if important plans change.
 Help plan routine tasks to create more time together…running errands, etc.
 Help plan fun time together for just the two of us and for time with the children
 Help plan and participate in vacations together.
 Help plan for and celebrate those socially and culturally important occasions, including family birthdays, Valentine’s Day, Anniversaries and holidays like Christmas, Easter, 4th of July, New Year’s Eve, Thanksgiving and Mother’s Day.
 Think of us and refer to us with ‘we’ statements and decisions.
 Always approach issues and discussions with honesty, even if it's difficult or I think it will hurt your feelings.
 Care for you when you are ill and help care for the children when they are.
 Participate in the household as a financial equal, as is appropriate to income, agreements and ability.
 Make shared decisions about investments, including real estate.
 Share the responsibility of caring for our home, including maintenance/repairs, weekly cleaning, shopping, and daily ‘chores’.
 Participate in decisions about décor, furnishings and where we live.
 Share the responsibility of caring for family pets, including feeding and grooming, 
 Share in caring for the children, as necessary and appropriate.  
 Speak freely with the children about issues that may arise during a day.
 Help reinforce established rules and household practices for the children (unloading dishes in the dishwasher, clearing table, putting things away, etc.)
 Put gas in your car if it’s empty or if its heading that way soon.
 Bring you coffee if I stop and know I will see you soon.
 Support you in your passions/hobbies/projects as my talents and time allow.
 Recognize that relationships change and be willing to fully participate in weathering the changes in our relationship, remain engaged in the process, and work it through, acknowledging that growth is often difficult.

"My boyfriend never wanted kids, but his ex had a ‘miracle’ pregnancy when he was 25 and she was 29. He was totally horrified but bought them a house and did his best before she kicked him out, moved in her ex and married him all within six months. He loves his daughter, but found it hard to bond with her until she got to be about 7 and was able to do more things. He has no desire to have any more kids ever again. We’re both 38 now. "
"White dude here. My black ex was never pressed with my culinary experiments (“I know you can marinate chicken in soy sauce, it’s not new”), whereas my very white mom has no idea what to do with paprika. It’s an earned stereotype."
"Check out /r/solotravel, they have a lot of good advice.

Bring a book (or better: an e-reader if you have one) since you will likely have to do a lot of waiting for flights/trains/etc. Also bring a portable charger for your phone.

Pack light, preferably with a backpack and not a rolling suitcase or duffel bag. You never know when you might need to walk with your bag over long distances (e.g. from a train station to accommodation). Backpacks are also easier to store and keep with you when you're on the move.

On that note: keep your things with you at all times. Don't leave your stuff somewhere while you e.g. go to the bathroom or to the restaurant car of a train. Avoid storing your bags on a luggage rack that is out of your sight, as bags are often stolen off the luggage racks in trains (this has happened to two friends of mine). If you must sleep on a train or bus, wrap the straps of your bag around some part of your body or attach them to something nearby.

Always always always keep your passport, other ID and some emergency cash (+ emergency credit card if you have one) on your person. Never EVER leave these in a hostel, even in a locker. Never put these on the luggage rack with your other bags. ALWAYS on your physical person. Have a copy or scan of your passport with you stored in another location or saved with a relative, this will save you so much trouble if it ever gets stolen.

As for female-specific security tips, I don't have any that aren't already common sense (e.g. don't get too drunk when you go out, make sure you always have a route back). If you're nervous about safety, you could try to book your departure and arrival times during daylight. But tbh I travel solo in Europe all the time and have never felt the need to do this. As long as you use common sense, solo travel in Europe as a female is not particularly dangerous."
I'll have you know on sunny days I'll only wear SPF 15 not 30... 
"Spin class after work. I love the music, the energy and the exercise. It’s improved my mood, I’ve lost weight, gotten in shape and made friends. It’s been awesome. "
"The guys who installed my internet set up the name and when they asked me what I wanted it to he called I blanked. So it's named after my cats, Lilo and Stitch.

But they misspelled it so it's named LeloAndStitch. 

Lelo like the vibrator company.

It amuses me to no end so I'm not changing it."
"Lighter, shorter periods. No pain when I begin my period!!! NO PAIN. *No pain.* After years of horrible, implacable, stop-your-life pain.

No. Pain."
I have to ask... why *did* you do that?
"At 20. Went to Tinder date's dorm after movie date. I was so sleepy, I was not prepared for it. He obviously wanted to hook up. It was awkward, so I left. But he still had to come downstairs with me and sign me out :/"
"A ""bad"" last name.  I don't really have an attachment to mine and look forward to changing it when I marry, but not to something like Sweat, Pooter, Frumpkin, Molestina, Colon, Butt(s), Cumming, Wiener, Pancake, etc.  
  
All real examples.  People I knew/worked with. "
"Marriage only matters on a personal level and people shouldn't be judged for ending a shitty relationship quickly and not ''sticking to it'' (this is a controversial opinion among my coworkers, apparently).  
  
If you want to get married 6 times for the sake of the party, whatever, go for it. It doesn't take the spirituality away from anyone else's wedding, I don't see the issue."
Some people have less discharge than others. These are the lucky ones.
