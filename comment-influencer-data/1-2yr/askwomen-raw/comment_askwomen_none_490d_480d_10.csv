No white bras under white tops or else you see it and it doesn't look good. Nude bras under white tops. 
"I'd fuck a taco because they are sexy and mysterious. It's like the guy you meet at a party who you've been eyeing all night. He's got too much hair gel but his jeans fit right and tight. You sneak into the laundry room and taco bends you over the washing machine and whispers in sultry Spanish in your ear while giving you the best pico de gallo you've had in years. But then the next morning you wake up hungover, your mouth tastes like a foot, and you're on the toilet shitting out the 13 tequila and cokes you drank the night before. 

 I'd marry pizza obviously, because pizza is so chill. Pizza is quick, convenient, and loves you no matter what. Pizza don't care if you haven't brushed your hair for 3 days and have cheeto dust on your Good Charlotte shirt that you've had since 2001. Pizza can get fancy. Put on a nice dress and get a hand tossed coal fired truffle oil and manchengo pizza and laugh at all the poor people. Pizza will be with you for your health kicks. Cauliflower crust cheese-less with watercress and pistachios and low sodium crush tomato sauce. Pizza will adapt. Pizza can get nasty with you. Stuffed crust with extra cheese and extra pepperoni dripping grease on your midterm paper that was due three days ago but you some how convinced your professor that your ingrown toenail kept you from finishing your essay. Pizza got you fam. Pizza been there since your first sleepover watching Rugrats until your mom fell asleep and scramble HBO sporadic boobs after. Pizza won't snitch. Pizza is an OG, always and forever. 

Sorry Pasta but you made me do this. It hurts me more than it hurts you. You came to me, on the day of my Cat's Wedding and asked me to cook you? I don't have the time pasta! You should have adapted. Like taco did, like pizza did! If I can't have you through a drive through I can't have you at all. And even if some maniac eventually makes the pasta drive through how will I eat you? I can't twirl and drive! It's utter madness. The streets would run red with marinara and blood! I have to do this pasta, for the good of all people!

"It was the first time he ever met my extended family. We were going to a family event at a pretty swanky hotel. He was wearing the suit that had been languishing in his wardrobe for goodness knows how long. He had recently lost the skinny chicken legs he had when he had worn the suit last, due to working out. I remarked that the suit looked a bit tight around the leg region, but he didn't listen. We got talking to one of my cousins and everything was going fine until my fiancé dropped his wallet on the floor.

He squatted down to pick it up and the loudest ripping sound you have ever heard ensued. People actually stopped their conversations and turned to look what had happened. He had ripped his suit trousers so spectacularly that it somehow stretched from his crotch all the way down to his knee. Inexplicably, he had chosen THAT DAY OF ALL DAYS to wear a pair of boxers that had a picture of a duck with writing that said ""Butt Quack"" on it.

There was just no coming back from that. He had to do his best to preserve whatever shred of dignity \(and trousers\) he had left and silently leave. We've been together for 5 years now, and my extended family still joke about it to this day."

"I so strongly believe that breastfeeding in public is fine. I'm around women who breastfeed publicly a lot, and if anyone ever tried to say something to them about it in front of me I'd jump in immediately and wrathfully. 

I do feel awkward being right there in practice, though. 

Do I look? 

Do I not? 

Do I pretend like it's not happening and maintain unwavering eye contact, or am I supposed to be chilled out and laugh with you about how hungry baby is today? 

Is it okay that I just saw your boob? Was I meant to turn around? Do you feel like I'm gawking? Do you feel like you're making me uncomfortable because oh gosh I don't want to make you feel bad. 

I feel like I overthink NOT making the mother uncomfortable, and like I'm going to offend her somehow, and end up squirming and feeling like I'm doing something wrong. "

"The ""hysterical woman"".

For much of the 18th and 19th century (and earlier), 'hysteria' was considered to be a legitimate medical or psychological disorder. It got so out of hand that any display of emotion, frustration, rebelliousness, or behavior out of the norm could have a women labelled as ""hysterical"". The Women's Suffrage movement was often discredited and dismissed with these kinds of ridiculous ideas. 

It was so deeply ingrained into society that people still to this day use this descriptor, and you will rarely hear it used to describe a man. Seriously, when's the last time you heard ""Oh, he's just being hysterical""?

**Fun fact**: the ""cure"" for this ailment was a big ol' vibrator and the resulting orgasm (which also was laughably misunderstood at the time). Makes you think the problem *may* have been attributed to men in some way...

Fit over size. Women’s sizes are all over the place and the numbers don’t mean anything (and often vary wildly within one store). It’s better to wear a size 14 and feel comfortable and confident than to try and squeeze yourself into a 10 just for the number and he awkward and uncomfortable.
"Can't afford to go to the doctor, so you only ever go when it's an emergency. Means a lot of things that start out minor or unnoticeable but get worse over time will go undetected/untreated while it would be cheaper to treat."

"Married with 2 small kids, finishing University and working minimally when husband up and leaves. SNAP and welfare were the only option until I got myself on my feet. Part of my benefits included childcare while working. My boss was nice enough to advocate for a raise. I received $0.25 more and hour. With that ""raise"" I made too much money to qualify for the childcare and lost $1600 in monthly benefits for childcare. I had to, in the most humiliating ask of my life, ask for my raise to be rescinded. So yes, getting a raise while poor, is too expensive.

"It's hilarious because it really does *not* look better when brushed. 

One day when I was in high school my mom was irritated about something and we had to go out; she took one look at me and said, ""You can't go out like that, go brush your hair."" I was also pissed over something so I went back up the stairs, brushed my hair, and came back down.

She never asked me to do it again. "
"Tend to ignore it, but called a male receptionist sugarplum once, in an even more condescending tone. He definitely didn't like it."
"I didn't kiss/date/have sex/have relationships until my late 20s.

- I had not experienced those intense feelings before and it hit me like a freight train. Infatuation, horniness, insecurity, fears, rejection.....I'd always considered myself a level-headed person, but I went completely off the rails that first year.

- I realized I had to change my attitude to be seen in a sexual/romantic way. I'd only ever treated guys as friends before, even when I was crushing on them. I had to learn to flirt, to touch, to BE touched without instinctively pulling back, to be OK with being desired, to talk about sex... To be OPEN. To take initiative. 

- I had to deal with the sudden feelings of vulnerability. The idea of someone knowing I liked them was both very scary and very alien, so even in relationships I had a hard time expressing feelings. I approached everything with logic or humor and maintained emotional shields that way. It wasn't super healthy. 

- I had to learn how to ask for what I needed - AND that it was OK to need those things in the first place. That it didn't make me naive or needy or high-maintenance. 

- I had to grow some soul-calluses. Rejection and breakups hit me extra hard since I'd never had to learn to cope or move on. "
"Oh, hey me, I didn’t realize we were meeting today. And being a lady, I feel like I’m *supposed* to know what to do here but *nobody teaches you tittiquette growing up.* 

But really, I can’t wait for the day where topless women are normalized like dudes so I don’t have to worry about basic tittiquette. If non-sexual shirtlessness for women becomes normal then breastfeeding loses all of its taboo, too. "
"Significantly less fun fact: the other accepted ""treatment"" for hysteria was surgical removal of a woman's uterus (and usually, ovaries). Her ""female organs"" were believed to be a physiological cause of psychological symptoms. 

This is, horrifyingly, the root of the term ""hysterectomy."""

I turn purple and drag him into our room where I proceed to lose my shit a bit and scold him for using that word. he's legit surprised, and when I prod a bit it turns out everyone in his family and his neighbours always call them kikes and he'd never really thought much of it, just thought it was a different word for jews"

"[Bluestockings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Stockings_Society) In the late 18th cen. it was a term used to describe nerdy feminists who valued education and conversation over fashion, and wanted women to have better access to education and civil rights.

She told me she had no idea what he said on their first few dates but she would smile and laugh anyway because she was with smitten with him. Every day he comes home from work and says “Hello my goregous wife!” They are absolutely adorable and amazing parents to their kids."
"Things that suggest he’s going to be with me for a long time. Like, I’ve always been annoyed he doesn’t have a washing machine at home, but he recently said he knows where to put a washing machine in his house if I move in and we get one. Just little things like that make me really happy."

"Take off your shoes, and stand on one foot. Notice that there are three places on the bottom of your foot which are holding your weight - one under your heel, and one on each side of the ball of your foot. If you think about using all of those spots to hold yourself up, you will find that your balance improves. Want to feel it improve several times as much? Tighten your abs! Whoa! suddenly you can do tree pose like a badass! (Clenching your butt along with your abs helps too, but you are talking about walking and it's hard to do that with a butt squeeze.)

Now apply those things to wearing heels. Yes, the load-bearing point on your heel is smaller, but it's not gone. You just have to get it under you without wobbling. How?  Tighten your abs. (And don't forget the other two points on the ball of your foot.) 

Notice also, that while you are balancing on one foot, your shoulders are back, your back is straight, and your head is up. Are they like that when you're walking? Probably not. Posture is key to balance, whether it's on one foot or two high heels. Remember your mother nagging you not to slouch, or think ballerina-not-slacker."

- Don't complain too much if your partner doesn't make enough noise during sex and approaches it like a ninja on a mission to kill the shogun. See, men have developed this habit due to needing to stay quiet masturbating when growing up. Because women totally didn't also do this and instead chose to resemble banshees during their adolescent years.

"One of the biggest suggestions to ""save money"" is to buy in bulk.  This works really well for middle-class people, but if you're broke, you straight up can't.  It's cheaper in the long run to buy pallets of toilet paper and 25-pound bags of rice, but when you've got 8 dollars in the bank, you can't.  And when you can only afford to buy the lowest quantity, you run out faster, which means you are at the mercy of whatever stores want to pay.  You don't have time to say ""I'm on the last pack of toilet paper, I better start looking for sales,"" you have to buy toilet paper at whatever price they are selling it today, which might be higher."
"Actually, literature from that era tended to romanticize tuberculosis in females a lot from back then. And, yes, suddenly fainting is one of the symptoms. 

Lotta people romanticized the pale visage of a young woman, constantly being doted over by her loved ones, constantly worrying about whether today would be her last day to spend with the love of her life. She's frail, meek and constantly needs to be looked after and taken care of, and she'll never be able to leave the house or question your authority. What more could you possibly want out of a wife? "
"We went to Zara Home and there were those pillows with mermaid sequins (that thing that changes color when you swipe). He started to draw/write something, I thought nothing of it and turned away. Then he yells “honey, look!”

He obviously drew a huge cock and placed the pillow on the highest shelf, with a grin on his face. I walked away as quickly as I could. "
"For me,  I've stopped telling the men I sleep with that I'm on several forms of birth control.  Why?  Because for some reason men seem to think if I'm on birth control,  they don't have to wear a condom.
I've had guys go from being fine wearing one to becoming incredibly resentful/unwilling  in the span of a few seconds.  

You'd think explaining that I don't want to catch anything would help,  but then they turn it into this whole thing about calling them dirty/ distrustful.  

The amount of times I've heard ""don't you trust me"" from men I've known for less than 24 hours is ridiculous. "
"When I first started dating my now husband, we were drunk at a party. There was a girl there that I knew, but he hadn’t met. She has a bad speech impediment, and he complimented her saying “wow I love your accent!”. He didn’t mean any harm, but I was horrified. 

Then once he was at a dispensary that was on the second story of a building. He was in line and shit his pants... He stood out on the balcony and called me, asking what to do. Uhm, come down stairs so we can go home and get you in a shower haha. "
"Oh man. I wanted a flat stomach so bad. I lost 40 lbs, got down to a size 2, took up running and crossfit, and still had a belly.

"I've told this one before. I was dating an alcoholic and a liar and we were having huge fights, so he finally agrees no more booze \(medically he was screwed, he was in his twenties and had been drinking something like 12 drinks a day for 8 years.\) He goes to a doctor, gets some medicine and starts the whole process of getting clean. He's telling me he's not drinking. He tells me he wants to play pool a few months later and doesn't mind if I have a pbr and he'll have a water. We get his water, in a solo cup, and my beer, in a beer can, and go to play pool. I take one sip of my beer and run to the restroom. When I get back the beer is nearly empty. I ask him ""did you drink this?"" and he says no. I ask again ""did you drink this?"" and he goes....""well I did...but it was an accident I thought it was my water."" Motherfucker thought that I was stupid enough to believe he mixed up a beer can with a solo cup of water and downed most of it.

Another time, we were cooking, and he was doing the asparagus. He put four spears of asparagus in the pan and tossed the rest of the fresh asparagus \(after snapping the ends\) and just made the four pieces, two for each of us, because in the picture of the recipe, the photograph only showed four spears on the plate...

ANOTHER time, a blind woman with a cane walked by and he goes ""She's not really blind."" and we all crack up thinking he's joking. He gets real serious and says, no she isn't she's my moms neighbor and is often home alone, so she can't be blind and is faking it for attention. Spoiler alert: she WAS blind. "
"If you are pressed for time, only iron the visible parts of your shirt. Collar, cuffs, and front part. Takes just a minute.

Speaking of ironing, all irons have a narrow spot near the point for ironing around buttons. My dear bestie didn't know this until she was 40.

Speaking of Ironing Part II: If you are bored on a weekend, you can bang out a week's worth of ironing while watching tube or whatever. You can press an entire week's worth of shirts and skirts in an hour on Sunday.

Speaking of Ironing Part III: Use spray starch to make clothes extra natty looking. See point 1 if you are in a rush.

If you love perfume but don't want to smell perfumigated...then put 3 drops in your lingerie/whateva drawer. It gives a very subtle nice smell to your stuff. Quite je ne sais quoi. This time of year, my most commonly worn item of clothing are camis. Coupla drops here and there in the cami drawer = lovely. In the fall, I wear hosiery a lot, so drops here in there in that drawer, too.

Speaking of hosiery, support types aren't just for grandmas. Anyone of any level of fitness can benefit from them. Wanna look good in them new slacks? Get support opaques and look marvelous. Comfy, too. I am quite a slender person and still wear support sheers...they keep my butt off the floor after 10+ hours at work.

"I was the crunchiest granola woman in the world for the duration of pregnancy and toddlerhood. I breastfed my kid anywhere without batting an eye, until he was 2 and started doing things like ""helping"" me take my boobs out in public places while shouting ""nurse pease mama!""

I will defend to the death everyone's right to breastfeed wherever and however they want, because it's important.

However, I'm 8 years removed from those days, and back to being surprised by unexpected nipples. Desperate to communicate how cool I am with what's happening, I make it weird for everyone. ""Him's havin a snack!"" says my mouth, as my brain wonders why I felt that needed to be said and especially why it needed to be said in such revolting baby talk. ""It's weird we've been friends for 18 years and I've never seen your whole boob before!"" Whooo approved the communication of that thought??

Then I start rambling about my own experiences breastfeeding, which I manage to express with a ton of unintended judgment. ""Yup, he never had a single bottle, no formula, and no solids before 8 months.  Baby cereal is crap, I can't believe people give that to kids. I mean it's different cause you were just thickening up his fruit puree, but some people mix it with breastmilk, like, why? I mean except like in your case, where you were trying to stretch your pumped milk, then it does make sense, of course. I didn't have to do that cause I stayed home until he was 2, I felt like it was important to be home for that part of his life. But I mean I was really lucky to have the opportunity, and I know you don't. What I meant was, I know it's important for you to keep your job, like, I know you feel really bad that you have to let someone else raise him all day, every day...not that that's what daycare is, though, because he's still with you most of the time.

Also, not having good conversations. I dated some guys I had a lot in common with but they weren't good conversationalist. We could have fun doing things together but we didn't have many (with some, if any) fun, interesting conversations on the things that weren't about my life or his. I like to talk about politics, social issues, hot topics in the society.. when it's just ""I did this today, you did this. I liked that movie, you didn't"" it gets boring after a while because it's not a conversation, that's exchanging information."

He's so sweet!"

"My parents married 56 yrs before my dad passed away at 79. Met at a dance where they had gone with others and happened to take the same train home. My mum's cousin was dating my dad at the time and she was there as well. Evidently she noticed the connection they made at the platform and told my mum hands off he's mine. My aunt (mum's sister) conveniently told both of them to meet her at the dance and they ran into each other again. The rest is history. 4 kids, 56 yrs and nary a harsh word between them. First thing my dad did every night when he got home from work was to find her in the house and hug and kiss her hello.

There are two distinct memories I have of them together. At  40th anniversary gathering with all the family present, he told the world just what she meant to him, his hand was shaking with emotion as he spoke as it rested on my shoulder.

The second is the last time he said I love you to her, the night before he went into a coma and passed away a few days later. You see, he had Alzheimer's, and he hadn't known who she was for the last couple of years. Off all the medication, he knew exactly who she was and even told her to be careful driving home."

"I realized that there's a difference between what I want, and what's best for me.  It sounds a little corny, but at some point I realized that things in my life should enhance it.  If overall something is causing me more pain than pleasure, I need to let it go.  

On a different note, there are plenty of things that I like that I'm not professionally suited for and that's OK.  I really enjoy making art but it will likely be a hobby for the rest of my life.  Same thing with my interests in science and math.  It's OK to be an 'armchair ____.'

I also had to accept that just because something isn't working doesn't mean I'm a failure.  Oftentimes it takes more strength to walk away than to keep pursuing something that isn't working out.  "

"My SO used to repeat a partial sentence with “what?” at the end when he didn’t hear me.  
  
So it would end up coming out like “You did what to your what?” Usually some mortifying combo. Very loudly, in public, of course. 
  
He didn’t do it on purpose but I put a stop to that shit pretty quickly. 
  
Also there was the time very early in our relationship when he talked to his brother about my yeast infection because his brother is a doctor and he thought it would be helpful somehow?? Nooooooooooooo. No. "
"Whenever we were watching a movie neither of us had seen before, he would constantly ask me “what just happened?”, “what is going on?”, and my favorite “who is that” to a completely new character on screen.

"They met at work. He spoke no English and worked in the warehouse she worked in the office. They would cross paths and catch eyes and both were instantly attracted to each other. The started trying to have conversations and eventually went out together. His English still not great she said he went to a theater and said here? She’s like okay. Then they went to a hotel and again she’s like okay. Twenty five years later they are still going strong. 

His English is great now and she’s a peach. It’s amazing how they literally couldn’t communicate to building a life together. "

They got married just out of high school and are still together. They struggled to conceive for years before finally being successful a few years ago. They are some of the most genuine and honestly just overall best people I know, and I think they will be together until they are the adorable little old couple that everyone loves."

"I almost did this on a book report when I was a kid. I was trying to describe a character with a synonym for “greedy” or “cheap.” I heard my dad describe a cheap friend of his as a “Heeb” once, so I used that. I had no idea it was a derogatory term for a Jew. 

Thank God I looked up the spelling before turning it in and found out the horrible mistake I almost made. "
"I'm falling hard and fast for this guy. Anyway, I told him I don't plan on kids and I'm ambivalent on marriage. He said ""yeah but, it's hotter to say 'I'm going home to fuck my \*wife\* than girlfriend"" 

It was maybe the hottest thing any single human has ever uttered. "
"When we were sitting on his porch, looking up at the stars, I said ""Isn't it crazy that there are stars bigger than our sun? It makes me feel small.""
Then he laughed at me and said ""No there's not. Our sun is the biggest thing in the universe."" Then he went on to argue with me and put me down to make himself feel smarter. I wonder if he ever researched it. "
"I don't tell people I'm not having children.  It is pointless.   Half the time they will try to convince me to have them or that I will want them.  I won't, I am in my thirties.

"He's no longer my SO, but my ex had a bad case of diarrhea one time. We were commuting all the way home from a party when he said that he ""just can't take it anymore,"" which I figured was about the you-know-what. All of a sudden while walking to the next bus stop the air smelled so bad that I almost hurled. Even stranger was that the smell was following me. I asked him if he farted a silent fart but it ended being much worse. He pooped on the spot. It wasn't solid poop, though. It was LIQUID. I looked down on his pant legs to see how bad it was, and it turns out that he had been leaking chocolate sauce all over the sidewalk. A trail of liquid poo drips can be seen on the pavement and his pants marred brown.

 I remember hearing people laughing and some murmuring, but I had to act unfazed as I wasn't the one drowning in shame. We just silently continued walking (we ended up not taking the bus) all the way to my place so he can clean up.

We're no longer together, but that's one experience I will never ever forget in my lifetime."
"Definitely ask these moms you know these questions. I breastfed two kids, sometimes in public, and if my friends/family had these questions I would have happily answered.

I'm sure it will ease everyone's minds in the end to have those lines of communication open. :)"
"i don't have any close friends. it's sad and empty but on the other hand, it's much better than my habit of ditching people when i get too scared of intimacy. better to stay alone and hurt only myself, you know?"
"My bank helped me out by giving me one of those ""virtual"" accounts-- they're a bundled pack of 3, you can keep literally both spares empty and as long as they were grouped you were good to go. Well. The welfare office considered these three linked, free banking accounts with $5 total combined as being too wealthy for benefits and denied SNAP for having more than one bank account. So being poor caused me to get the poor people account and then I couldn't get help with food because I had the poor people bank account. I got it because it was free and it's a bundle and I'm poor! Thankfully that was a while ago and I got a better job so I can actually afford to eat now."

"My college boyfriend and another male friend and I agreed to rent my professor's house while he was on sabbatical for a year, including caring for his cat.  But my boyfriend and I broke up right before the semester started so I found other living arrangements. Since I was still on the lease agreement I went by at the end of the year to make sure the house was in order. It was not, but the worst part was that they had not changed the cat's litter box one single time in NINE MONTHS. It was buried in an overflowing MOUNTAIN of cat shit. Bless this poor cat, she persisted in using the box even after there was literally no room left in it and she had to climb on top of her own turds to defecate. I would've given up and used a corner.

Somewhere on an old thumb drive I have photos of it and the other mountains of trash those two left in that guy's house. I cleaned up after the two pigs so my poor professor wouldn't come home to a garbage dump of a home. Awful."
My dad had buffet style food at his rehearsal dinner. My then boyfriend (now husband) used the plate upsidedown. So it was sloping downwards. My family still make fun of him for it to this day. 
"These are my two go too's that seem to work well for me:
**1.** If you aren't sure about an item leave it and think on it. If you forget about it later on or the next day, it was not meant to be. If you can't stop thinking about it go back and buy it or buy it online. 
**2.** For pants, always best to try and do a sit and squat test. If you cant sit or squat in them comfortably, or they feel like they might rip, don't get them. You will just be uncomfortable when wearing them and it will show. "

"A person who is emotionally unavailable does not share their emotions with others, pretends not to have emotions, and makes no effort to understand the emotions of others.

If someone is truly emotionally unavailable they may desire a relationship, but they will find it difficult to begin one and almost impossible to maintain one."
"My parents met while my dad was doing a cover gig at a bar. Tainted Love became their song because that's what he was playing when they first saw each other.

Mom was a shy Midwestern Catholic girl, just 19, who had never been on a date before or kissed anyone. Dad was 25, a musician from Arkansas. They dated for two weeks and eloped on Mom's day off from McDonalds and college. Lived in a studio apartment with a mattress on the floor.

Mom's family didn't speak to her for a year. Totally disowned her, gave her siblings her stuff. Except her grandpa, who loved my dad.

One day, they were visiting him in the hospital, and my great grandpa told my dad he wanted to sell him his house. Well, a musician and a fast food college student couldn't afford that. So gg asked how much dad had in his pocket.

And that's how my parents bought a two story Victorian for $1.50. The rest of the family was furious. 

Their marriage lasted from 82 to 07, when my dad passed, and survived my dad's serious accident in which he became a paraplegic man, poverty, and so much struggle. But they never fought. They were totally in love and devoted to each other. They shared dreams, weird psychic flashes. My dad thought mom hung the moon and helped nurture her self-confidence, gave her an accepting family. People are so shocked my mom could have ever been called shy. And she stayed by his side and cared for him through unimaginable suffering.

I don't generally believe in fate or love at first sight, but they made me question that."
"When I told him about a really traumatic experience for the first time and he said, “I’ve heard worse” thinking it would comfort me"
Not hard enough to completely come out but I have had problems where it will slip down to an uncomfortable position. So I usually just remove it before I poop.
Not all my tattoos have “meanings”. So many people get shocked by this that now I sometimes make some up.
I have RBF so I just look at them and blink. 
"My abusive ex killed himself as soon as I had the courage to leave, and was very specific in blaming me in his note. I came back to our house a few days after I left to get my things &amp; found him (and our pets he had killed before taking his own life) - it was like a scene from a horror film. 

I'm assuming it was shock, but I hardly reacted at all. I just called 999, calmly explained the situation, and waited for emergency services to arrive. I had to re-tell the story over &amp; over for police statements etc and never shed a tear. It did hit me a few days later though, and I was a wreck for a while. I was convinced it was my fault, if I had only been a better girlfriend etc. I don't feel that way now - he clearly had a lot of mental health issues that went untreated for too long. I do still (6 years later) get flashbacks to that whole ordeal, but overall I'm doing ok now."

"When he sees something that reminds him of me. In the first month or two of us dating he bought me a couple of Ferrero Rochers because he remembered that I mentioned that I liked them. Even though it was a tiny gift, it felt like a lot, especially because during my past relationship my ex never bought me anything once (even though my birthday fell during the 6 months we dated). My current boyfriend makes me feel so valued and loved. "
"I am not offended by it and would never complain but I find it uncomfortable as I am bothered by anything baby related like pregnant stomachs, the idea of a baby inside someone, child birth, changing nappies or the idea that breasts can produce milk, just the whole process grosses me out. My best friend knows this and when she is breastfeeding she will stand near me and go 'LOOK!!!', which she finds hilarious. "

"I still can’t believe this. My longest relationship was from 2011 to 2014 but we did break up for a few months in between. Still 2-3 years together. We still kept in contact because we ended on good terms, we saw each other twice last year and had a weekly phone call. He was my only true confidant. I could tell him anything, I knew secrets that he didn’t even tell his girlfriend. We may not have been dating anymore but we were both special people to each other.


I knew he was depressed and he had previously told me he was considering suicide. I tried to talk him out of it. He stopped mentioning it so I thought he no longer felt that way. 


I talked to him on the phone only a few days ago. He seemed fine, we talked about my job, he comforted me about my car accident, and he would tell me about his girlfriend. 

I found out that on Tuesday he committed suicide. I am still having trouble processing it. I have never had somebody so close to me die. Despite that he was my ex, he still was a huge part of my life. I told my parents who knew him and they were upset. I can’t believe this is real. Just today I had something interesting happen and my thought was “I’m gonna call Peter tonight and tell him about this” because that is what I’d do all the time. But then I remembered he’s gone. Forever. I can’t stop thinking about it. Our weekly phone calls are no more. 

I am devastated. I am so shaken. Every second I am thinking about this. I went out with some coworkers to dinner yesterday and hung out with somebody tonight. Usually I never hang out with anyone EVER but I have told people what I have gone through with my ex killing himself and I have had a huge outpouring of support. It means so much to me. I’m gonna make plans with people and make an effort to spend time with those who care about me because this shows that somebody can suddenly be gone in an instant. "

"Didn't date or anything until I was 25. The biggest challenge was that I would accept a lot of bad behaviour/poor treatment from my romantic interests because I didn't know how/didn't have the confidence to advocate for myself. 

Examples: Bf disparaging my looks, encouraging me to look/dress/act like a porn star (I wasn't into boob-popping tops or micro skirts, and I didn't like wearing much makeup). Sharing intimate details with his friends and laughing at me about it. Or bf growing distant and saying, ""Well, if you DON'T hear from me, that's a good thing! It means I'm doing fine!""

Fucking tool. Eventually I found someone wonderful who didn't pull any of that shit and it raised my standards."

"Just this past week, my SO wanted me to reheat a frozen pizza. I normally reheat pizza on a metal pan, so it doesn't directly touch the oven, so I asked him what I could use for the pizza. He gave me a plastic tray, and even though I thought it was strange that he'd want me to put plastic in the oven, I didn't question him. I ended up melting the plastic tray and ruining our dinner. 

The plastic tray was to put the cooked pizza on to cut it. I was so embarrassed that I put plastic in the oven that I couldn't stop crying. He's a sweetheart, though, and helped me remove the melted plastic. "

"I dated a guy from 2006 to 2008. He attempted suicide while we were together. He lived about an hour from me and he left me a voicemail saying goodbye. I was able to call 911 and get an ambulance to his apartment in time. A few months after that I knew that I just couldn’t deal with all his mental issues, so we broke up. He called me about 9 months later out of the blue. He seemed to be in a really good place and was excited about the future, or so I thought. A couple months later I got a call from one of his friends and she told me he killed himself. The police had confiscated his computer and cell phone, so she wasn’t able to contact me until well after the funeral. Needless to say I was devastated and of course I blamed myself for a long time. I found out a few months ago that his mother also committed suicide sometime last year. Not a single day goes by that I don’t think about him. I rarely talk about it and very few of my friends know.

"When someone with pencil straight hair rave about how others like it when that person  does their hair. And thus, “you should let me straighten it sometime!”

"To me the hardest part of generational poverty is opportunity. 

Let’s take “Sue” as an example. Sue went to school for cosmetology while bartending to pay bills. She finished cosmetology school, but she can’t depend on having a clientele fresh out of school. A lot of parents would allow their 20ish year old child to live at home while building said clientele. Sue’s parents can not afford to have her stay at home without some sort of financial contribution. So she has to work to have a place to live, transportation, etc. and her parents have no money to help. Best case scenario she works her two jobs (80+ hrs a week) and takes years to build a clientele and become a full time cosmetologist. More likely, she never fully builds a clientele due to some sort of financial catastrophe and stays a bartender. 

She’ll never have the easy go or the opportunity that families with more money have. And it sucks. "
"Women always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? He’s a cool guy. Being the Cool Guy means I am a handsome, capable, strong, funny guy who cares about equality, listens to life’s woes, and doesn’t check out other women, who doesn’t waste time, drinks good whiskey, enjoys making love and cuddles, and grills steak and veggies during the summer like a world class chef while also appreciating everything his woman does, because Cool Guys are above all capable. Capable and confident. Cool Guys never fail; they only stumble sometimes, learning quickly and showing their women they can do anything with finesse. Fix any problem, negotiate with ease, and keep his calm. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Guy.

Women actually think this guy exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many men are willing to pretend to be this guy. For a long time Cool Guy offended me. I used to see women – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender men, and I’d want to sit these women down and calmly say: You are not dating a man, you are dating a man who has read too many romances written by socially awkward women who’d like to believe that this kind of man exists and might love them. I’d want to grab the poor woman by her shoulders or purse and say: The bastard doesn’t shy away from naked girls on Tumblr or Pornhub– no man can resist a sexy body! And the Cool Guys are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the man they want to be, they’re pretending to be the man a woman wants them to be. 

Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Guy, I beg you not to believe that your woman doesn’t want the Cool Guy. It may be a slightly different version – maybe she’s a yogi, so Cool Guy loves calm morning stretch sessions or handstands; or maybe she’s a punk chick, so Cool Guy is a tattooed musician who tours with his band between checking out her art shows. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, she wants Cool Guy, who is basically the guy who listens to every fucking thing she says and doesn’t ever complain while helping fix her electrical wiring or change her oil. (How do you know you’re not Cool Guy? Because she says things like: “I like nice guys.” If she says that to you, she will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like nice guys” is code for “I hate nice guys.”)"

"I nursed both my babies and would do my best to time it where I wasn't openly doing it in public. So if we went to a restaurant, I'd do it in the car first. If I absolutely had to, I'd find a discreet corner somewhere, and I had clothes that could still cover, and a baby blanket to cover us up. 

All of us people are out in public together and it's just being a decent person to be mindful of one another. Like a guy who walks right up into a group of people blasting the music on the speakers of his phone as loud as he can, why not put your headphones on? There's a middle ground we need to share when we are around each other. 

I don't like the nursing moms who are so fanatical at proving a point they insist on just ""whipping it out"" and ""screw everybody else's opinion"" because they're determined to ram down everybody else's throats that boobs and nursing shouldn't be taboo. Boobs and nursing *shouldn't* be taboo, but shoving it in someone's face with attitude is not the way to go about it. To me they're just as bad as the ones who make a show and screech in horror at the sight of nursing. "

"To me, a date is more intentional: it’s where both parties know they are specifically going out to see whether there is romantic interest, or explore existing romantic interest. Hanging out is less intentional; it’s just, you know, hanging out.

That said, hanging out doesn’t mean there isn’t romantic interest there. I’ve only been on one “date” in my life. In my social circles, the typical progression is hanging out to making out to you’re a couple now. I find it it much more comfortable to hang out than go on a date; the latter feels so awkward and artificial and more full of pressure to me. "
"For everyone who says there's no reason to breastfeed without a cover, it is actually pretty tricky to breastfeed with a cover. It's one more thing to deal with when you've already got a screaming baby. It's hard to see/monitor your baby with a cover on. Many babies and toddlers hate covers and just whip them off. For me personally, I never used a cover not because I want to flash my boobs around but because my priority is feeding my child, not making everyone else feel comfortable."

"I very recently read a book called [Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Harm-Medicine-Dismissed-Misdiagnosed/dp/0062470809) and the author's discussion on hysteria is fascinating. She talks about it throughout the entire book because so many modern illnesses/disorders that mainly or only affect women (like Fibromyalgia or PMDD) are very similar to what doctors used to call Hysteria. She basically said that most of the ""contested illnesses"" we have today stem directly from Hysteria- and that women's pain in general is very often described as psychosomatic (all in her head) whereas men's pain is typically seen as physiomatic (real, bodily pain). Highly recommend this book for anyone interested in how women are treated in medicine."
This is the winner. Calling it.

"Jane Austen pokes fun of personality types that map basically exactly onto modern people—the “classy” woman who talks shit behind your back and thinks she’s so superior, the teenager who’s a little too into melodramatic romance novels and brooding men, the responsible, overlooked woman who’s keeping the family running despite the best efforts of a useless man, etc. The 90s teen movie Clueless was based off Emma and it works perfectly because people really haven’t changed that much in the past 200 years."

"So I remember I saw this long guide somewhere on Reddit that was written by an escort. It was legit. It looked something like this:

* Wait as long as possible in the shower for the hot water to open up your pores/hair follicles 
* Exfoliate the areas first with a loofah, sugar scrub, etc. 
* Apply baby oil to areas and rub into the skin.
* Apply shaving cream to the areas, shave with a clean razor \(men's razor preferable\)
* After getting out of the shower, apply hydrogen peroxide to areas prone to razor burn \(i.e. bikini lines\) and apply deoderant to those areas as well
* Apply moisturizer to areas

This is how I've gotten the closest, smoothest shave possibly \(for all areas of the body\). I think the baby oil and hydrogen peroxide make the biggest difference, tbh. "

"That I’m unhappy with my weight and trying to do something about it - apparently you have to be obese otherwise people feel the need to roll their eyes at you for being unhappy. 

It shouldn’t matter that they think I “look fine” - I don’t feel fine. This is the biggest and heaviest I’ve ever been, and I don’t fit my clothes. In a conversation where people are discussing their weight, I’m generally made to feel stupid if I mention it, so I don’t anymore. "
"It was actually when I was super young, about 13 or so. My mom forced me to go to Sunday school because she wanted me to make my confirmation, and the class was taught by an older man who was pretty mean. You could tell he didn't want to be there, you could tell he didn't like anyone in the class, etc. 

I missed a day of Sunday school once, because my family had gone on vacation. We took a cruise to the Bahamas, and when I got back, my friends and I were talking about it before Sunday school began. The teacher was definitely listening to me, and when I was done talking, he leaned in and asked me, ""did you get a bikini wax?"" I was 13. I barely knew what that was.

I told my mom, who immediately freaked out, and she called the school, saying that if I didn't get put into another class, she'd take me out altogether. The woman in charge of everything was really nice, and agreed that the question was inappropriate. I was put in another class, and the guy got fired."

"Reading your responses to other responses I think you want to hear that something is wrong with you if you haven’t lost your virginity yet. Even though it doesn’t even matter if you’re going after the right person. Toxic masculinity really has a grip on you so I suggest getting out of that mentality. 

So here’s the answer: People who haven’t lost their virginity by 18 are losers who have no social skills and I don’t respect them. 
Is that what you wanted to hear? "
Don't do anything for the woman but do expect her to fulfill all your sexual fantasies. Don't expect anything less than a porn star because you have standards but if she has standards she's stuck up! She should be naturally flawless because women who put an effort into themselves are vain and vapid!
"So I’ve had this discussion with my mom on so many occasions, I’m fine with it she’s staunchly against it. She just kept repeating the same “talking points” “‘no one wants to see that, you can use a cover. I could always plan my day so can you, I beastfed at home that’s how it’s supposed to be. You don’t need to do that in public. We don’t pee in public do we?!” But she couldn’t respond to/didn’t feel upset about breast in advertisements or cleavage or people being slightly/moderately exposed on the beach. It’s a hot button issue, I honestly believe it boils down to control. We’re raised to believe (especially older generations) that women have to behave a certain way, and that your reputation is most important and women are of higher value when chaste and fully covered, that when you see a woman going against that modicum of belief, engaging in sexuality for her and not to the benefit of a man or society, or deciding to present her body in public (even if just to feed her child) people just snap. It breaks with everything they’ve been led to believe about how we’re supposed to interact and the just have irrational hate towards it. I’m probably just rambling here, sorry if this makes no sense, but these are my 2cents. "
"Buy better and buy less. Women suffer around the globe to make our inexpensive clothes. Be conscious of who you buy from, and don't let our quick shopping high be enough to justify that millions of women are barely more than slaves for the clothing industry. Educate yourself about fast fashion, and don't be part of the problem that affects all of us. "
"Socializing. It's hard to socialize when you don't have the money to spend on dining out/concerts/movies/trips to the amusement park/aquarium/mall/wherever, or when the cost of gas is too high to justify taking trips to see those long-distance friends/family. And entertaining at home isn't cheap either. 

Plus, hobbies are expensive. You have to pay for paintbrushes/cookware/booking teetimes/lessons/a musical instrument/whatever your ""thing"" is, and if you don't have the money, you can't do it. Even ""cheap"" things like yarn for knitting add up, and if you're working crazy overtime just to make ends meet, you might not have the time or energy to do them anyway. So not only do you miss out on experiences, you end up not being able to do hobbies, which means you (through no fault of your own) become the (other) dreaded B-word: BORING!"
"I have had to explain this to so many people who have had no clue. They tirade about welfare moms and don't realize that that's my story.

The system is not created for people to be able to get out of it. "
"I think you're conflating Charlotte Lucas-who marries the odious cousin Mr. Collins even though she doesn't love him and he's terrible so she can have financial security, with Lydia Bennett-who is seduced by and runs off with Wickham because she's young, silly, and frivolous and thinks he looks handsome in his uniform.  Wickham only marries her because Darcy bribes him to by paying off Wickham's debts.  

Charlotte was a pretty nice woman with a terrible mother and no chance of inheritance and had to make a shitty pragmatic choice to marry someone vile or risk being impoverished and incapable of marrying later.  She's like your awesome roommate from college who ends up married to some bro-y dude and now only spends her time redecorating her sun room.

Lydia would spend her days using snap chat filters to give herself glittery bunny ears and instagramming muffins.  "
"I might catch some flak for this, but oh well.... My husband is a very talented actor who never really cared about being in show-businesss, but has always been active in local theater. In addition to that he's played Jesus in our church's passion play every Easter for decades. He's a wonderful actor and I know he enjoys what he does, but watching him get crucified every year is just mortifying to me. Watching him walk around in his little underpants that look like a diaper, being beaten and crucified with lots of screaming and writhing around. I don't really know why, but I just die of embarrassment. I'll never tell him but secretly I'm so happy he's finally decided to retire from being Jesus. "

"This is actually a very interesting question. Not sure the concept applies the same, though, but still. if I had to describe an equivalent, it would be men who pretend to be into women's rights, feminism, pro-choice. On less serious subjects, like entertaining, they probably would try to put on a cultured, educated façade, portraying themselves as really sensitive. And hand in hand with the ""Cool Girls"" thing, I'd probably guess they would keep things like their sports fanatism, their geeky passions, and so on either hidden or completely out of the conversation. Picture someone who discusses real life things with his SO but secretly keeps a stash of graphic novels in a closet. I'm not sure this makes sense at all, just trying to imagine how it would work in the real world.

Thing is, a lot of men focus mostly on the physical, so ""Cool Girls"", in my understanding, also affect this behaviour so they won't be regarded just a physical object but someone worthy of interacting with on a (shallow) human level."
"The only thing that irritates me is when mom just has her breast out after baby is done eating, like just leaves it out and dares someone to say something.

I had a former friend that did it and it was beyond annoying because if anyone was looking they were a perve and sexualizing breastfeeding but the baby was done 5 minutes ago.

Other than that, feed your baby however. Cover or no cover."

The shower is in the bathtub, so I pull back the shower curtain and go to step in when I notice the whole tub is filled with kitty litter and cat shit... His tub is the cats litter tray. So I call out to him and ask if there’s another way for me to shower, and he says, “Oh, I just push some of the poop away and shower with the kitty litter still in there”... I decided to marinate in my filth, and get the fuck out of there so I could have a kitty-litter and poo free shower. He called a few days later asking if I wanted to spend the weekend at his place, I politely declined and never spoke to him again. "

My kid didn't take a bottle, we were on a bench in public not near an outlet so I couldn't have pumped, and if they thought the back of a baby's head was immodest then they probably wouldn't like discovering that breast shields/cups are translucent. Also, he wouldn't eat with a cover on and I was not comfortable with making him wait hours to eat."

"My ex told me I needed an oil change. I told him he was right, but how did he know? He told me all those splats on my windshield were oil splashes, and if I didn't get my oil changed soon I'd run out. I laughed, thinking he was joking, and told him they were bug splats. He said ""I've worked on cars longer than you...I know what I'm talking about"". WTF.

So I had to test that logic. I excitedly exclaimed ""babe, I saw a werewolf today!"" He said ""are you sure it wasn't a coyote?"" I said ""I've lived in AZ longer than you. I know what I'm talking about"". He actually thought about it for a second, shrugged in agreement, and said ""huh. That's freaking cool!"" "

So basically, I still feel like the chubby, unattractive girl from high school and have the confidence to go along with it, which has made dating hard."
Who the hell is washing their black clothes with bleach??
"She raised a hand to her mouth in shock, then laughed very hard, at herself and at my hair.

She later bought me a wide tooth comb because someone told her I might appreciate it, and she grew to like my curls."
"&gt; What more could you possibly want out of a wife?

A large dowry or claim to her father's estate."

"My own! I look back at it now and realise I did it because I was just so in denial and had such low self esteem. He was abusive, but my Facebook followers would have been none the wiser based on what I used to post. It's very sad. I left 9 months ago now. Won't be making those mistakes again."
"We were cuddling after sex and I jokingly said ""you liiiiike me!"" and he looked really awkward and said ""I more than like you. . ."" and then got quiet. So I said ""It's okay if you love me, I love you too."" "
"Nah, you fuck Hemsworth, marry Jackman and kill Cavil....lol."
Confidence. Horrible people are always so fucking confident.
"I guy walked up to me to tell me that, ""You are the sexist woman in this Walmart"".

I took a look around and laughed my ass off."
"He doesn’t believe in any “made up holidays” and is kind of an ass about it. I asked him to get hissa flowers for Mothers day this weekend and he went into a rant about commercialised crap. 

The fact he doesn’t believe in them is fine. The fact that he doesn’t realise that the people around him do is annoying. "
"The only time I've ever truly been angry with him, and it was super early on in our relationship - we'd been together for about 4 months. We took my younger brother out to dinner. He was 14 at the time, and my SO and I were 20. My SO started asking my brother about girls and giving him advice about playing the field and basically telling him to sleep around before settling down. My brother was super weirded out and I was so mad at my SO I didn't talk to him the whole way home. It's not that I disagree with sleeping around, it's that it was awkward and embarrassing, and that my brother was still pretty young. My brother was sleeping over that night, downstairs. My SO apologized over and over and totally understood why I was mad, then suggested he go down and apologize to my brother and tell him he was just joking around. I cheered up pretty fast at the way he wanted to work to fix the situation. "
"I recently paid 140$ for a 12$ parking ticket. I'm a single mom, no child support. I got the ticket because I had to take my son to the hospital but didn't have a credit card and parking only took credit. Then I couldn't pay the ticket as I was on welfare.

I'm finally making money again and it's depressing playing catch up."
When he said he was going to shrink a $5 note using the iron and it started smoking and almost caught fire. Still marrying him though lol. 
"She has a video of me doing exactly this on her phone haha. I went back to her house one night after I had too much to drink at the pub with some friends. She knew I was drunk so took advantage of the situation by goading me into saying stuff she rarely gets out of me sober. She jokingly said “I want to hear all the things you like about me if you want to stay in my bed tonight” I started saying all this stuff I usually find so cringey to say, something along the lines of how I thought she was “intelligent, witty, kind, generous, sexy, forgiving ( for example when I get drunk and come and disturb her) and let’s be honest way out of my league” and then I pause and say “but most importantly you’re great at cuddling” and then I just lunge across the bed to grab her around her waist 😂 I didn’t even realise she was recording just thought she had her phone in her hand but she’s laughing at this point but doesn’t stop the damn recording! But I get hold of her and am lying on top of her staring at her with these dopey watery drunk eyes and say “in fact if I’m being completely honest I’m pretty sure I love you”. Was the first time I had ever told anyone I loved them and now it’s on camera forever haha


"
Omg my boyfriend does the drunk thing too and I love it. He’s so bashful about it when I tell him what he said in the morning and it just makes it even cuter! 
Not as shitty as OPs SO
"He didn't believe in dinosaurs (and not for religious reasons).


We broke up and I'm now dating a scientist."
"And for a country that talks so ""pro-life"" and ""family values,"" the U.S. certainly doesn't walk the walk."
"Had a date yesterday that consisted of board games, playing badminton, and then grabbing dinner.

Planned to add a walk and possibly pool/snooker afterwards, but we were both exhausted so saving it for next time!"
A walk around the neighborhood followed by dinner and all the snuggles humanly possible.
"I've lived with several boyfriends, and what I have learned is that people don't change. If they don't cook, they're not gonna start. If they don't clean, they're not gonna start. If they don't do laundry, they're not gonna start.

So, now I would only move in with someone who actually does all the adult stuff by themselves. "
Not my current SO but my ex used to scream shit out the window at pedestrians. He and his friends thought it was hilarious. I thought it was mortifying and started childlocking the windows whenever I drove.
"Fuck Chris Evans, marry Chris Hemsworth, kill Chris Pratt.

Easy as pie. Sorry, Andy!"
Honestly theres no trick. You have to wear them and get used to the odd feeling of being off balance. But yeah like everyone else said a chunky heel a good starter.
"Well shit. I think marry Idris, fuck Jason, and kill Leo (sorry Leo). "
"I don’t know if this counts, but I was with this guy and he lent me his sweater. I put my hands in the pockets and felt small sharp things. I picked them out of the pocket and it was a bunch of toenail clippings."
"Backstory: My sister suffers from borderline personality disorder so she has some issues surrounding attention (not getting it, getting too much, and so on). 

She never showed up to my wedding. She didn't tell me she wasn't coming - in fact she seemed happy and excited about it. Then she just never showed. I remember getting ready in the dressing room at the chapel and asking everyone if they'd seen her arrive yet, calling her cell with no answer (this was before texting), asking people to let me know when they saw her, etc. I remember walking down the aisle scanning the pews for her face. I looked for her all throughout the reception and kept calling her phone with no answer. During the reception is when guests started to notice she wasn't there (she is my ONLY sibling) and began asking me (the wedding party of course already knew she hadn't showed because I had them all on alert to be looking for her). 

So basically my whole wedding and reception were ""where's your sister?"" and I didn't get to relax or enjoy any of it because I was so worried about her.

She never apologized to me. Her excuse for not showing up was that she didn't want to be around both our parents at the same time (they've been divorced for many years) BUT she had no problem being around both our parents at the same time for her daughter's high school graduation several years later - or for her daughter's wedding last year. "
"I was doing some freelance networking work in a dentist's office and I was also talking to him about my son. My son's teeth have no room. The Dr said to me, ""Spacers aren't that expensive, only about $10k."" 

I started laughing so hard that I had to stop what I was doing. I then told him, ""That is one third of what I'll make next year, assuming that the state doesn't fuck up my wages more.""

He actually didn't charge me anything for my son's next tooth extraction. (His baby teeth wouldn't come out on their own btw.)"
"Dude here, but I have serious potential as a drag queen. 

The butt squeeze is no joke. It puts your hips forward and forces you to lean back from the shoulders (opens your chest and makes it larger, also easier to breathe). Essential to doing the butt-squeeze properly is a tight core. Excellent posture improvement.

You can walk while doing this. Simply stop thinking about your ass. Lean forward with your hips and backward with your shoulders. Maintain this feeling and start walking. Your hips should ""roll"" while you walk and should feel sassy as fuck. 

If you have bad posture this will effectively be a constant workout every time you walk. You're probably going to feel it in your upper back between the shoulder blades (tits are heavy yo). Also in your lower back and glutes from ""pushing"" your hips forward. Unless you have bulletproof abs already you will feel it there too. Suck it up. It's not about wearing heels it's about being healthy. Good posture keeps your joints in good health and protects your back. 

If you can I would get good posture *before* strapping on the stilleto heels, but a quality pair with a lower chunky heel can be an excellent trainer since they kind of force you to stand and walk with better posture. "
“It won’t be cozy until you’re here.” 
"Yeah, I’m not a hijabi but I wear head scarves sometimes and depending on the material, I actually find it cooler. So your description makes a lot of sense to me"
"The last one I finished was *I'll Be Gone In The Dark* by Michelle McNamara. It's a true crime nonfiction book / memoir about the Golden State Killer, but also about Michelle McNamara since she died before completing it. The killer has recently been caught, but hadn't been yet when the book came out in February. It's a very interesting read - a good intersection of lots of different human stories. It's brutal in places because the crimes were brutal, but I found it easier to read now that he's been caught. "
"It wasn't as big a deal as I made it out to be - both having sex and waiting.  I don't regret it, but I don't know that I'd feel the need to hold out for marriage again. "
y'all nasty
"Most people leave me alone, but I did get the genius lady who said she was a hairdresser and loved my curly hair, and then *proceeded to run her fingers through my curls like a brush.* She's supposed to be a professional and she's breaking up my curl patterns? "

"My mother.  Not even on purpose, she's not malicious, but she would definitely start revealing personal details about me to anyone who asked.  I've never met a friend of hers without that person knowing everything about my life (or at least everything I've told my mother, which these days is not a lot). "
"Don't look at the price. Pick it up. Try it on, imagine where it fits in your wardrobe. Think about the quality of the material. Then decide how many dollars you like it. If it's more, don't get it,.you aren't getting your money's worth. But if it's way under that number... Score. I am notorious for telling my friends ""yeah, it's cute, but I only $20 like it, and it's like, 50 bucks. No deal."" Keeps you on budget, and with fewer regrets. 

Also fashion tape can help your shoes from slipping off, not just for keeping your boobs in your low cut top. Also, you can often get away with skipping an ironing if you hang your shirt up while it's still hot and not quite completely dry from the dryer, and maybe hang it in the bathroom when you shower for a half-assed steaming. 

Also also, this is a reminder to get your nice leather boots.cleaned and oiled before storage over the summer. And really to oil your nice leather goods in general. Keeps them nice for longer.  "

"The  early to mid 1800s was when Jane austen was writing many of her books,  Lydia... without giving to much away  is kind of a valley girl, with no skills of her own she marries a rich man she doesn't love for the sake of money. 100&amp;#37; she would wear ugg boots to starbucks and drive around in a prius daddy bought her."
"Right, it's actually the other way around. The term hysteria comes from the belief that the uterus was causing women's uncontrollable emotions. 

You know, an old fashioned belief that has totally gone by the wayside... "
Me too! Black or nude are my go to colours.
"I would begin to eat my food right when it arrived even if others at the table were still waiting on theirs. It’s not a rule across the board, but I try to be more conscious of those around me now. Most people don’t really care, but in more professional settings i wait for everyone. "
"-40 is the same in Celsius and Fahrenheit, so -35 is fucking cold (technical term) in either scale. "
"I'm on the unhealthy side. I'm horribly lazy and don't enjoy eating. It's a chore to me, so it's not uncommon for me to go 14+ hours without eating. Sometimes I'll go 24-ish hours because I'm too lazy to get up to get food.  

On the other hand, sometimes I'll eat like five meals a day, but honestly, because of my horrible eating habits, my stomach size is pretty small so I get full quickly. 

I don't think it needs to be said that this is a horrible idea lol. I'm trying to fix my eating habits because it's just not healthy. "
Are you dating my husband?
"I didn’t have my first date or relationship until last year at 23. For me the biggest challenges were my own insecurities/jealousy about his past relationships and now working through my first break up. 
I just don’t have the experience to cope with my situation in an effective or healthy way. I don’t even have the experience to fully understand everything that’s going on right now tbh."

"When I was helping him review his personal job review and he kept using the term ""in example"". He would write something like ""I budget my time well with my job. In example, I get to my meetings thirty minutes early."" 

I asked him why he was saying ""in example"" instead of ""an example would be"" or ""for example"" and he claimed that he was using ""i.e."" just not abbreviating. I.e. is the abbreviation for the latin phrase ""id est"" meaning ""that is."" 

Apparently, he had been doing this all throughout high school, college, and his professional career. "
"You should do a movie called TragicalKingdom: Outside The Law, where you go around seducing christian men and forcing them to leave their churches. But then you get mixed up with a Salvadorian priest Tony Salvano, who turns out to be a drug dealer and you have to bring him and his goons down with your unique brand of street sex justice. "
"I am not offended by it, I'm grossed out by it. I'm childfree, so almost everything about having a baby squicks me the fuck out. I've been grossed out by breastfeeding since I was about 8. 

When I met my new babysitter at the time, she had an infant. I was an only child with only one cousin near my age and had no idea any animal but cows made milk. I was really confused when she stuck her breast in his mouth and asked a million questions. I was pretty grossed out when I found out breasts made milk.

Also warm milk in general makes me nauseous so the idea of sucking body temperature milk straight from any animal, human or not makes my stomach churn.

I won't say anything and I leave people alone. But I'll also try my damndest not to look, especially while I am eating and quietly thank my OB/GYN for not hassling me about obtaining sterilization so I never have to deal with that.  

Live and let live, there are more important things to freak out about than a mother feeding her child. "
"The Greek word for uterus is hysterika. Both ""hysteria"" and ""hysterectomy"" are derived from it. 

Hysteria means ""wandering uterus"" and hysterectomy means ""removal of the uterus."" "
"Yeah I remember talking to my grandmother about the relationships her friends had in the neighborhood when she first moved in. One woman's husband used to just take their car and disappear to go hunting or hang out with his buddies for hours or even days, making it difficult or impossible for his wife to hold down her job. She was determined to keep working, because she loved her career. In the end, she saved up and bought a used car for herself to use, in order to reliably get to her job. My grandmother was absolutely shocked at the time. She said if she had done the same, her husband, my grandfather, would have seen it as a sign of disrespect and he would have killed her for it. They are still together because she doesn't believe in divorce, but holy hell, I don't believe in living in a relationship where making my own reasonable purchasing decisions with my own money to keep my career could get me killed. I don't know how happy my grandparents were over the years (I would guess not very) but I know that many men and women have been able to get out of horrible marital situations because of the normalization of divorce."
This sounds life changing.
"At some point, enough of us who have been around while social media has thrived will come to realize that the people who bombard social media with all aspects of their personal lives are by-and-large unhappy. I used to think I was jealous and that people really *could* be that happy. But after 10+ years of this stuff, there are just too many examples of those people being horribly unhappy to ignore it anymore. 

People who cannot break free from that validation loop that social media provides are addicted and they simply are not learning how to be happy with who they are. They always need to be the person that the internet wants to give likes and comments to. Honestly, it's hard to watch this happen to people in my generation (30). It scares me to think what a generation who hasn't grown up without social media will be like.

So much with the internet has gone awry. Where I used to think the internet would allow for increased individuality and expression, I now see that, for most, it's never going to be more than an echo chamber where people mold themselves to whatever gets them the most attention."
"This is good advice. Also try an ankle boot with heels for extra support while you get used to them. Don’t start out with anything that doesn’t have an ankle strap or, if you do, make sure they fit snuggly around the top of your foot. Floppy heels can hurt you."
"I actually hate people complimenting my curls.

Not because I hate my curls - I like them! 

But... I always liked them. But when I was a kid/teen, other girls mocked my hair all the time, because perfectly straight, thin hair was the in style, and my super thick and curly hair was *not cool*. 

Even my mom was always on my back to straighten my hair instead.

Now, the same people comment about how pretty my curls are, and I just want to give them the double bird."
"This is an ex, and I totally forgot about this (again) until all of the poop talk on this thread, so thanks for that: we were in a book store together and he went to use the restroom. After about ten minutes I figured he got lost finding me so I went to check by the bathrooms. In about five minutes he emerges, telling me he needs my help with a guilty look on his face. He says he shat all over the stall walls (there are people around as he's telling me this) and it just got too out of control for him to clean. We leave immediately and he tells me how he didn't want to sit on the seat, and the diarrhea was apparently so explosive that it just went everywhere. Once we were in the car, he smelled so strongly of shit that I had to drive with the windows down and stop at a gas station to get a clip air freshener. He always had really awful hygiene and this was one of the final straws"
"My hair looks exactly like the ""before"" Anne Hathaway in Princess Diaries when I brush it."
"Thanks, I just threw up in my mouth a little."

I love your outfit. You look amazing. 
"If my husband was on Reddit he would tell this story:

I have really bad IBS and one time about a year into our relationship I had an episode and ended up shitting in his great grandmother's bushes behind her house (the one and only bathroom in the house was not available, and we were way out in the country so we wouldn't have been able to get anywhere with a working bathroom in time).

I'm probably pretty lucky that he still stayed with me after that."
Let me just get my weather machine out of storage... 
"I wouldn't clink everyone's glasses when giving cheers. APPARENTLY, it's a faux pas not to touch glasses with everyone within reach and make eye contact. I would hold my glass up, nod and then take a sip and all my coworkers would take it as rude. So now I make the effort to clink glasses."
"Whenever I spend the night, he gets up before me and makes me a cup of coffee even though he doesn’t drink coffee. He HATES coffee but I love it so he makes it for me. :) The sweetest thing he does. "
"[Kiera Knightly talks about corsets and her experience with them](https://www.today.com/popculture/keira-knightley-loves-period-films-hates-corsets-wbna26739678).  

&gt;“Positively awful. They were made in very much the same way they were made back then,” Knightley said. “I think probably their corsets would have been tighter. Because I said, ‘If I’ve got to stand up for 16 hours a day making a film, then can I please be able to breathe a little bit? It would be really helpful.”’

&gt;“It’s not really a surprise we were known as the weaker sex, because you literally cannot get a breath. So it’s sort of, as soon as you start getting emotional, if you’re doing an emotional scene, you can’t calm down. You can’t literally draw a breath to try and center yourself again,” she said. “It’s no wonder they were sort of fainting all over the place.”"
"My best friends parents. They met on the street and basically immediately fell in love. They’ve been married for 19 years now, with an amazing daughter who is my rock and forever will be. They’re just all round amazing people who love weird stuff. I love them so much, they’re like a second family to me "
"It was a bad decision. I am divorced from my ex now, but I would have rather had sex with him and known what I was getting into rather than being stuck with him legally and then finding out what I had gotten into. Compatibility is really important. My ex ended up being flat-out disrespectful of me sexually because I didn't want to do the things he did and he never took my ""no"" as a real answer. He was disrespectful in all kinds of other ways, but knowing about the sexual stuff might have persuaded me not to marry him, but I was young and stupid, so who knows. 

I have not remarried yet, but I am in a stable relationship with someone who treats me with respect. The sex is also a million times better. I will never advise anyone to wait until marriage again. "
"I’ve heard that this is a major reason why the US has such a high maternal mortality rate. Women get no prenatal care and then they show up in labor with problems that would have been fine if detected earlier, but end up being fatal. "
"You might be interested in reading about adult attachment theory. My therapist recommended the topic to me, and it blew my damn mind to see myself described so accurately. 

Turns out that I'm emotionally ""avoidant"". I'm not afraid of commitment, but I'm pretty bad at it. I highly value my privacy and independence, and can get cranky quick when I feel exposed or smothered. I'm also bad at reading other people's  emotions and get very uncomfortable in the presence of strong emotions, positive or negative, so I tend to avoid emotionally charged situations. If I have a disagreement with someone, I'll just avoid that person or that topic so I don't have to deal with it. I like to deal in facts and logic and other concrete things like that because I find them much easier to navigate. Communication about intimate things is hard for me because it makes me so uncomfortable 

Related, and the reason I sought therapy in the first place, is that I'm anxious as fuck. Turns out that I avoid my own emotions as well, which isn't healthy. Strong emotions still exist in me, but they manifest as anxiety because I keep them stuffed down inside and try to ignore them. 

Stereotypically, ""avoidants"" are men and it plays out in our society as the assholes guys on tinder who fuck and run, but that doesn't give the whole picture in my opinion. For me, this isn't about manipulating people, or consciously trying to keep other's at arms length. I really want to make connections, and don't actively go out seeking to be an asshole. It's just that my natural, gut reaction to emotions and intimacy are pretty crappy. 

I'm working on it though! Weekly therapy, journaling about emotions, and just plain ol' practicing hearing and expressing emotions. It also helps that my husband has the patience of a saint while I learn the emotional skills of a 6 year old, even though I'm in my 30s. "
"Don't get a haircut that requires styling if that's not in your daily plan for grooming. I do hair and there is nothing worse than trying to explain to a client that unless they style their hair like the photo, it won't have the desired effect they are going for "
"Haha, I've done that exact same thing after a night of too much tequila. Except I didn't poop and try to flush my underwear. I did barf on the bathroom rug, though AND have my period, so the flood water was nasty. Flooded the kitchen, hallway and parts of the living room. Not my proudest moment. "
"I think less of people who use the words ""amazeballs"", ""awesomesauce"" and ""epic win"". I know they're not hurting anybody, but the red mist just descends when I hear it."
"There are so many little things he does that make my day, or make my mood skyrocket. 

Every morning since I moved in with him a year ago, even when we’ve had an argument, he always makes me my morning coffee, and makes sure to kiss me goodbye in the morning. 

I slip notes into his lunch box some times, but when I was working, he’d sneak little love notes into my lunch and hide them so well I wouldn’t see them until I was actually unwrapping my food - every time I found one, my heart would beat a little bit faster, and I’d be smiling like crazy all afternoon. The other day, he put one in the microwave so when I went to reheat my coffee I’d find it. 

He tells me that I am beautiful, and sexy, and clever, and cute, and amazing all the time - he’s always trying to build my confidence. He loves all my chubby bits, and sometimes will grab my big thighs, or my love handles, or something that I dislike about myself, and growls and says I am sexy, and it feels so nice to have someone desire me for the things I see as flaws.

He will just stare at me some times, and then say, “God I love you!”... he says that he’ll look at me, and it will hit him just how lucky he is, and he’ll just feel flooded with love and emotions, he just has to say it... And I don’t mind at all, because every time he does, it makes me feel so loved and important. 

In all of my previous relationships, there’s always been an inequality of love - like, it always seemed like I was always the one who loved and cared more, and I’d give my partner my all, only to be shortchanged when it came to reciprocation, and I’d only be getting a small fragment of love and effort back... But, I don’t have that with him. Me and my happiness is his highest priority just like he and his happiness is mine - we love and respect each other a great deal, and everything we do in our lives, we do with each other and our future in mind...I have most definitely found my forever person! 

to;dr - my SO is amazing, and he’s pretty much stuck with me. Forever. *sinister laugh*"
"I find that just seeing him at the end of every day brightens my mood significantly.

I could've been having a migraine, going through PMS, upset about something that happened, having a low self-esteem day, but the moment I see him, everything just feels *better*.

He'll rush over to me, so happy to see me and smother me in hugs and kisses as if I don't see him every day. He'll stare at my face and tell me how beautiful I am, despite my hair feeling crazy and lack of makeup. He'll say he missed me and loves me so much. It makes me feel like a princess. &lt;3 All of my problems feel so small when I'm around him."

"Same answer I gave there: at 27, he decided he wasn’t happy with his job and life path, so he decided to “go back to school,” which meant night classes at an acting school, which cost $14,000 and wiped out his savings. He still has the same job and nothing has changed other than my leaving him after he cheated on me with a woman in the acting program."
"Can't speak for the distant future but a guy I knew in high school was perpetually single, not because he couldn't have gotten a girlfriend (he was very attractive) but because he had his sights set on this one particular girl for about two years before she caught on and asked him out. This was 2011ish.

Fast forward to now and they are one of the most beautiful and strong couples I've had the privilege of knowing. After dating 7 years, they got married last fall and just had a baby girl.

Everyone knew there was something special between them from the start. They just make it look so easy."

"It’s not so much what he says, but more how he says it: quietly, right next to my ear, and in a vocal range women are incapable of achieving. 

Well, it’s a little what he says. It can’t be too aggressive. Like, “I’m gonna cut your arms of” is an example of something NOT to say. 

“I want you” is good, but “baked potatoes” works just as well. Then I’m laughing AND turned on."

"My weight. Nobody believes me that I weigh ""that much,"" and it makes me really uncomfortable when people make a huge deal of it. And everyone always makes a huge deal of it.

When I'm asked my weight nowadays, I just shrug and say I don't know, then I change the subject."
"I'm super jealous. I'd look like an albino turtle if I wore that, only with more neck sweat."
"&gt; he just picks it up and puts in back in his mouth without even rinsing it.

I swear my jaw literally dropped at this. Y I K E S"
"My fb couple is like this too! They're a relation of mine, on fb they have this glamorous life taking their kids for holidays and day trips, new cars, quad bikes for the kids, you name it and loads of #blessed to have this amazing family type stuff. But in person, they're constantly fighting due to the stress of their crippling debt. Neither can dial back their spending, but they'll constantly gripe about how much the other one spends. I imagine those fancy holidays are completely ruined by all the passive aggressive digs they have at each other all the time."
And that's why healthcare should be free and universal.
"In social satire ""A Night of Serious Drinking"" Daumal wrote about a large, loudmothed, sober, vegan girl. I hadn't realized they had straightedge feminists in the 1930s."
"&gt; Care to write a list. Thanks :)

You asked me to. "
"“I love your curly hair! Have you ever straightened it?” Like if you like it so much, why do you want me to change it?? "
"My older sister lives a completely fictitious life on Facebook. I swear she only got married so she could post about it and how ""blissful"" she is. She told him they should get married after only knowing each other for 5 months (met online, started dating immediately). She had already come to me with serious problems (drug use, lying about it, etc) before then. They got married in November and, since then, divorce has been put on the table at least twice. They're constantly arguing, ignoring or blowing up at each other, etc. Yet her Facebook is loaded with pictures and comments about how happy they are, re-posting their wedding photos, etc. It's a sad situation for everyone and they're hugely incompatible. She's going to go visit her daughter's father for his graduation ceremony soon, purposely without the husband, and I'm pretty sure she'll be rekindling a flame there."
I think this is the first I've heard of an actual room outfitted properly. Usually it's just a room with a door and a regular office chair. It's nice that there's more than one too :)

I hate to break this to you, but you're married to Buddy the Elf.

"Cat shit... everywhere. 

All over the floors...?
On a bookshelf by the bed...? 
On the ledge of the bathtub...?!

He’d just let these cats shit wherever and you could tell it had sat there because it was all hardened and stuck to the carpet. (Yeah. Tried to clean one up. Once.)

And he wouldn’t even acknowledge it?
Like he’d just quietly step around it as he walked around the apartment. Ugh. 

"
When he told me all about the reptilian alien overlords and how they are running the world. And then he thought a movie that was 140 minutes was 1 hour and 40 minutes long. He didn't seem to understand that 1 hour = 60 minutes. 
"man I feel this. Old Navy is a good bet even though sometimes their smalls fit me? It’s weird. Their sizing makes no sense. 

Target and H&amp;amp;M are good too. I get most of my pants (the knit jeggings, high waisted, specifically) from American Eagle because they’re sooooo comfortable and have lasted me a really long time. I’m a 10 there. The shorts are great too though it’s hard to find some that aren’t already full of ‘stylish’ holes. 

If you have a Plato’s Closet in the area that’s a good place to shop all the places (or any other type of secondhand consignment-type shop). 

edit: shirts to shorts "
"Hit them with a ""darlin'"" in the same tone they used on me."
"JFC my husband is ALWAYS in the bathroom. I have no idea what is wrong with his digestive system, but he literally goes in there at minimum 3x's a day, for at least 30 mins at a time. No, he will not go to a doctor. No, he doesn't eat fast food. He has done this for years. We have separate bathrooms, because of this issue. And our house is not soundproof, I can hear the entire symphony, and it is gross. So disgusting, and I hate it. 

He also swishes his coffee when he drinks it. It makes me cringe, and I leave the room when he's drinking coffee. He doesn't do it with anything else, just coffee. "
People with no real interests or opinions or hobbies. They're difficult to have anything more than small talk conversations with.
"We were at my friend’s party and he got incredibly drunk and was being kind of an asshole. Finished the night off by finishing his glass of vodka and just TOSSED IT OVER THE BALCONY. Then as I was yelling “Dude, what the fuck??” He grabbed mine and threw it over too. Then giggled. I told him about it the next morning and he was mortified. Offered to buy my friend a whole new set. I’m still mad about it and we haven’t been together for over a year 🙄"
I WOULD FREQUENT THE HELL OUT OF THAT PLACE
"Someone who is emotionally unavailable will avoid commitment, making connections, and sharing about themselves. In other words, they act like they are uninterested/don't want a relationship."
