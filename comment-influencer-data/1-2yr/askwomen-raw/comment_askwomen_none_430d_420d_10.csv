"As a mom, I'm 100% on board with it. The kinds of restaurants banning kids are the kind that I don't want to bring my kid to anyway. If I'm dropping serious money on a fancy dinner and drinks (in addition to cash I'm giving the babysitter), I don't want to listen to other people's kids either. "

"I met him in university. Picture a shy, kind, nerdy dude who decided to break out of his shell. He'd spend time going to other student's computers to help when they needed it and was so patient with everyone. His work was really good, but he'd never flaunt it or think he was better. He'd host events at his apartment like board game, movie nights, or LAN parties for video games. One year he hosted thanksgiving for students too far from home to have their own family dinner. He'd plan hiking trips and other fun activities and open the invitation to anyone who wants to come. I mean anyone! He had no bias for age, gender, sexuality, race, etc. One time some of our teachers joined in.

He was there to help any friend when they moved, and would listen and offer advice for any problem. He quickly became one of my best friends and the friend group was rather large. Graduating and getting jobs in our fields didn't change a thing. He was still his kind self and made time for everyone.

We're getting married in September."
I don’t think asking is bad if you say it with confidence and a smile. I went out with a dude who asked if it was okay to hold my hand and then later to kiss me and I thought it was nice. 
My vibrator 
"My now husband asked if he could kiss me for the first time (25 and 32 years old). It was both awkward and respectful. Of course, I thought, “yeah, you dummy.” 

I now look back on that moment with nothing but sweet sentiment. "
"This bouncer at a bar. Any time a woman left a bar with a shady looking man he would stop them, have the woman tell the bouncer who the guy was and where she thought she was going. If the story didn’t add up he would put her back inside the bar and try to find her friends. 

I know because that’s how he saved me. "
"An electric kettle. 

No more whining tea pots, no more forgetting the stove is on while I’m playing video games with headphones. It comes to a boil, and shuts off. If I forget about tea, it’s ok, at least I’m not gonna burn the house down. 

"
"When I was a cashier they had this lady who was holding up the line with how slow she was moving and walking. I was getting slightly annoyed as was the people behind her. At the end of the transaction I told her, “Hope you have a great day.” (As I do everyone) She told me, “I’m two months cancer free, it’s one of the best days God could give me.” I was seventeen, and in that moment I learned that I shouldn’t get upset over trivial things like a slow moving line.

Always remind myself it's 1000&amp;#37; better than having the wrong person next to me. 
"I married my husband because he is endlessly kind. He's kind to everyone. He has no temper. He's calm and affectionate. Even when he's stressed or tired or life is complicated.

What I like about him also is that his kindness is confident. He isn't passive or a pushover. If he needs to assert or defend himself he does, but he does it respectfully.  He's gentle yet masculine. I love him."
Typhoid Mary maybe?
I was walking to school with my clarinet. My mom never bought me boots for winter because we were too poor. I slipped on ice and this lady from afar saw what happened. She picked me up and lifted me to a standing position. Even patted my knees and said are you okay. Your knees must hurt. You need better shoes. I said thank you and went to school. The next day I saw her again with her kids. She looked at my shoes again. A week or two went by and we saw each other on the way to school again. She gave me a bag which had boots in it. It was bigger than my size. She said she didn’t know my size but hope that I can wear it one day. I did the next winter.
"I was addicted to heroin for 4 years, and used to use a public bathroom to get high. A worker in that establishment noticed me every morning (not smart I know) and finally called the cops on me one day. I was arrested, spent a few days in jail detoxing , and went directly to rehab when I posted bail. I’ve been clean for 6 years. That one person, who I hated at the time for ratting me out, probably saved my life. "
"I think it's understandable and it isn't a matter of disliking or liking children.

Some public locations just aren't suitable for children.

There are a lot adult only resorts like this as well. If I'm looking to spend a nice evening dinning in an upscale restaurant, then I'd like this to not be ruined by rowdy children.

There are plenty of casual restaurants that are great for kids and families. I don't see how this limits anybody at all.

"He bought me a blanket. 

I was in Target with my then-boyfriend and we saw a man walk in ahead of us with a huge, awesome dread going down to his knees. The dread isn’t relevant but it was cool. We were in the sale section when I found a felty type blanket with satin edging. I was so excited and talked about the same kind of blanket I had as a little girl and how cozy and safe it made me feel. 

(Back story here...my grandma had just passed away and I was in the midst of an abusive relationship so feeling cozy and safe was something I really needed at the time.) 

My boyfriend talked me out of it because it wasn’t in my budget and I sadly agreed and walked away. The store was about to close so we had to make our purchases at the customer service counter and I saw dread man directly ahead of us, buying the blanket I wanted. When he was finished, instead of walking away, he turned round and handed me the bag. 

He had overheard our conversation and he wanted me to have that blanket. I can’t remember exactly what he said but I was so touched by his kindness. It gave me the feeling that things were gonna be okay. I’ll keep that blanket forever. 

I’ve never seen him again but if you’re out there dread man,  thank you. You’re the real MVP. "
Handheld steamer. Wrinkly clothes bother me so much but now I can fix them in just a few minutes time.
"It didn’t really impact my life because I had no idea what was going on, but it involved me...

My dad was away on business and I became  deathly ill and had to be rushed into surgery. I made it obviously but they weren’t sure I would. My dad was at the airport on stand by and a complete stranger heard him telling the gate agent his situation. The stranger gave up his seat on the flight so my dad could get home sooner. I can’t even imagine what that flight must have been like for him (Chicago to Texas) and not having to wait even longer was such a gift. "
"''jesus. your face. what is wrong with you?'' - stranger lady, grocery store, me with horrible cystic acne at 12 years old.

Because movies need conflict and tension to maintain a storyline. The love triangle is a really easy way to create tension and conflict.
I fucking love podcasts. I love entertainment and information that I can enjoy while also doing all my other shit. I love that I can keep my brain occupied while my toddler plays independently without exposing him to screen time. I love everything about podcasts and I don’t care if that makes me a hipster millennial. 
Blackout curtains and a fan. I’ve never slept better. 
"I met an older fellow at a Jazz course. He was playing clarinet, and since we were making small talk I asked him how long he'd been playing for. ""Four years!"" He said, ""I started when I was 74 and I'm 78 now!"". He was a pretty good player.

It really impressed on me that age isn't a barrier to learning anything, it's really more about the willingness to commit the time."

Wear sunscreen! 
"For me, it's more about the mindset of some people rather than with the religion itself. Despite the prohibitions and the obligations are generally the same for both genders, women get hounded upon more in our actions and behaviour. For example, covering up is required for both genders (for men, between the navel to the knees) yet in where I live, some narrow-minded men (and even women) felt that it is acceptable to shame any other women who chose not to wear hijab. These women win medals in the Olympic or made a groundbreaking scientific discovery yet some people were more focused on the state of their dressing instead of their achievement. This kind of cyber-harrassment are almost non-existent for men though. I don't want any men or women for that matter to judge my actions and behaviour. That should be between me and God alone."
"My IUD, in the sense that my insurance covered it. 5 years of no-worry protection? Sweet!"
"I'm definitely more free-range than my sister. My 13yo son has never done anything to cause me to hover (come home late, not answer if I call him) so I pretty much leave him to his own devices while my sister insists on knowing exactly where hers are going, with whom etc"
"My eldest sons best friend. My boy joined the military a few years ago and his friend still stops by to hang with us. He owns a restaurant and constantly brings us dinner and he always makes sure my meal is dairy free. He stays and watches movies with us, helped my 15 yo study for his permit test and is currently helping my husband make our concrete countertops. He refuses to let us pay him for the food or his time, so we frequent his restaurant and I tell all my friends to go eat there. He's just a damn good kid. I've known him for  about 15 years and I've never seen him be disrespectful, mean, or even angry. It's no surprise....his parents are amazing people, too. "
"Haha, Kat Von D is a famous one, you could go as her"
"I have a hard time reading social cues and generally don’t like being touched unless I’m really comfortable with you, so I would really appreciate being asked directly in the early stages of a relationship. Once that level of comfort is established and I get a feel for when he generally likes being affectionate, though, I’m all for the spontaneous gestures and will freely initiate them myself too. "
"I grew up in a very abusive family. In my teens I was suicidal and ended up hospitalized after an attempt.

There was a nice man who was not a therapist and I only saw once. He saw me isolated in my room (we had group therapy and other activities) and depressed and he came and talked to me. 

He told me it doesn’t matter what’s happened and how I feel about my family or anything else. I just had to get through two more years (I was 16). He told me to just stay tough, keep my head up and make it two more years. 

I’ll never forget that conversation and I did take his advice. At 18 I was on my own and I never looked back. My family is still toxic and that man gave me a “permission” of sorts that allowed me to put a wall up to the bad things from my family. "
"I was raised in a Muslim household but I am not longer Mulism or in contact with my birth family. 

One thing that I would change is the idea that women are treated like property. I was my parents' property and they would decide who I will marry and after the wedding, I would be my husband's property. 

The idea that a women's worth is put on beauty, her virginity and her ability to find a husband is wrong on so many levels. 

I can go on and list a billion things but this one came to me first.

Any female character from Kill Bill? Lizzie Borden maybe?
"People who get nitpicky about dumb stuff like does this girl have nail polish while she prays? Etc. So dumb. Also treating a certain type of hijabi better than others. Everyone loves the hijabi who wears the hijab, wears full face makeup, clothes from Zara, and clothes that don't entirely hide the curves she has. They don't like the girls who wear hijab with no makeup, in a 'lamer' style, or don't show that little bit of forhead hair. Rich hijabi is the only style appropriate in the community, when the whole point of hijab is modesty. Also hating on women who don't wear hijab is annoying when you see the more stupidly conservative guys freely talking with nonmuslim women, no issue, but suddenly if they find out I'm Muslim not Hindu, immediately I can see the judgement in their eyes. Not even my great grandmother wore hijab, it's just not in our culture. "
"*Highly* recommend a weighted blanket. 

Also, scented candles. Essential oil diffusers. ASMR bedtime roleplay videos. Slow, mindful breathing. It sounds cheesy but sometimes I like to caress my own forearm by gently gliding my fingernails across my skin. It’s surprisingly soothing. "
"Here's the thing, and its going to feel really out there. Dress as Mulan. There was about 2,000 Huns on that mountain and only 6 survived- with *one shot*.

"When I lived at my old house, I liked to take early morning walks along the pier. It was so early that there was usually nobody else there. One day, I thought I saw a seal in the water so I stood at the edge and looked in for a while to see if it would come back. I don't know how long I was standing there, maybe 2-3 minutes. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned around and saw a guy who had obviously been jogging on the pier. He said, ""Do you need to talk?"" I didn't know what he was talking about so I said, ""I'm sorry?"" He said, ""It's okay. I won't judge."" He thought I was contemplating jumping into the water and ending my life because I was standing there for so long. I wasn't suicidal at the time, but I have been in the past and knowing that this person would have been willing to talk to a complete stranger at the lowest point in their lives made me realise that the world is full of truly good people. "
"My house: computers, books, paintings and drawings (from myself and my kids) and video games. 

My brother's house: Guns. Taxidermied animals. Fishing stuff. Four wheelers. Hunting gear. They don't have television, or a computer.

My parenting style: Be kind. Be gracious. Live for happiness, not possessions. Learning is the most important superpower you have. Be a hero.

My brother's parenting style: Be kind. Be gracious. Material possessions show people your value. Making money is the most important skill you can obtain. Be materially successful. 

Actual conversations with my brother:

Him: you should make your kids go outside more. 

Me: we farm. We have a literal farm right out there! They help us farm. We hike. We are outside all the time!

Him: but they waste so much time reading and being on their computers, they could be learning real skills. How are they going to find jobs if all they know how to do is operate a computer? 

Me: ...your kidding, right? 

I like to think we are both great parents, who value different, but both important, aspects on life. "
"A face wash and moisturizer that work for me. My skin isn't bad to begin with (it's a bit dry, I have some redness, I get whiteheads but not much acne), and it helps keep it clear."
"This is probably unhealthy, but when I feel like I'm not good enough I think about people who are shittier than me but have achieved what I'm trying to do. Then it becomes like a ""if that dumbass can do it, so can I."" Etc I would love to say I have a more uplifting and inspirational way of powering through but it is pretty effective."
"A mosquito.

Get some fairy wings and a really long straw. Then go around the room and drink out of people's drinks. 

When people get annoyed be like ""I'm a fucking mosquito, what do you expect? BTW you now have malaria."""
Oh god...this just reminded me that I had a dream last night that I went to get my vibrator out of my drawer and it came alive and started like flying around the room making really loud buzzing noises. It was so fucking weird.

"My cousin and her boyfriend told everyone they were getting married. They planned to just get married at city hall instead of having a wedding to save money towards a house. They posted pictured of themselves in city hall with their friend who was the witness. Afterwards, the entire family met up for dinner. During this dinner, we all gave them wedding presents. Most of us opted for cash. My grandmother alone gave them $7,000. The next week, they moved to Texas to be closer to his family.

Three weeks later, it comes out that they didn't actually get married, and faked the entire thing. The ""husband"" got angry that she wasn't sharing the money equally and snitched to the family. All the family members have been talking this week trying to figure out how much money they scammed from us, and it's around $12,500. "
"A guy on the street once told me I “look like I can take a dick good.” I was at work, at an after school program, at 3 in the afternoon. I was walking kids to the park when this dude passing by says that. It made me obviously uncomfortable, but I really felt bad for the kids. "

On our first date we went to a couple bars where I happend to catch a news break and have my phone blow up with calls that two of my good friends were in a serious car accident and killed someone. I obviously went into panic mode. He didn't care that I cried, held my hand and came over the next day with take out and a movie because he didn't want me to be alone. 

He's helped me with so many other things too. Helped me tear a wall out of my house. Build a deck. He takes me on dates. Tells me I'm beautiful. Is helping me with my anxiety and being very encouraging while I go through therapy. And even though he's allergic to my cat, he loves her and cuddles her all the time.

He's pretty perfect. "
"BOOM. That's actually such an easy costume because you can use cheap af temporary tattoos from a Spencers or Hot Topic, basically buy some gothy clothes, a wig or black hairspray for the evening, and heavy makeup.

Agreed.  It’s cute.  No mixed signals.  :) 
I was at the public library and used my last twenty cents to print out a copy of my resume before a job interview. The printer glitched and messed up my formatting and I had no more money to print it out again and had to leave so as not to be late. The guy at the counter calmed me down and gave me another twenty cents and I ended up getting the job. I was crying and very upset and he really came through for me. 
"once i was on a date with my current SO (this was in the early stages when we didn't know each other that well yet) and he asked me if I minded if he left briefly to help this old lady with groceries. I think it's nice that he recognized that I might be uncomfortable with him leaving and therefore asked, and I think it's nice that on a date he noticed some old lady carrying groceries and his immediate instinct was to go over and help. 

This single anecdote is representative of what kind of person he is in general. He's always like this.

---

Two of my exes were great guys, the kind where we broke up for specific personal reasons but I would whole-heartedly endorse them dating a friend of mine.

One of them, the day he broke up with me, he came to help a family relative of mine out with something. Then after that he broke up with me, in a very nice respectful way. I think that him going along and helping out even though he surely already knew we were breaking up that very day says something nice about him.

The other one was always so gentle and considerate, really honest and careful about how he spoke. He was the oldest sibling and I was impressed by how seriously he took being there for his siblings and supporting each of them in their own way."

"When I was 10 years old I was on a routine grocery run with my mom. She sent me to pick up something at the other side of the store and a random adult man started stalking and following me from the other end of the aisles. He was not trying to hide and kept saying things, I don’t precisely recall but it was clear he was being predatory and it scared me. He didn’t stop until I clearly found my mom again. Later when we were in the car I told my mom about this, expecting... I don’t know, sympathy? Protection? But all she said was, “You’ll miss it when you’re older.”

Wtf mom. I was 10 years old. "
"Dress as yourself, and bring food labelled ""Punch (definitely not poisoned)"" and ""Cyanide-free cookies"".

Then when someone asks about your costume, laugh nervously and say you are definitely not a killer. By the way, have you tried the punch? I hear it's to die for."
"1) Confidence. 

I can’t stress this enough. From being worried about whether the person likes you on the date to being worried they won’t text you back, none of that will matter if you have confidence in yourself. 

2) Try to be positive and not serious all the time.

Basically, be able to have fun. The happiest people I know don’t have to take themselves seriously 24/7. Additionally, no one wants to be with a partner that’s always bringing others down or themselves down. 

3) Be content on your own (come from a place of wanting someone, not needing someone; i.e. don’t get a partner b/c you think that’ll make you feel happy.)

For the most part, be happy with yourself before you try to find someone else. A good partner is like an accessory, not a crutch. At best, they will enhance you, but without it, you won’t feel incomplete."

"You don’t always need to have a full face of makeup! For me, because I have oily skin, I can’t wear foundation (even Matt) without having to maintain it throughout the day and because I’m lazy, I don’t do that. Therefore, i only spot conceal with concealer and put a bit on to hide my under eye circles and my skin looks better than with a full face of foundation. 

So buy makeup according to your own skin, not your favourite youtubers skin as it may not work for you. 

Also, for skin products, ALWAYS GET A SAMPLE FIRST to make sure it’s the right product for you! "
"I am a cashier. I had a customer get all over me because he found out I was married and didn't have children. He said to me, ""Why the fuck would you get married if you didn't want kids. There is no point in marriage without kids,"" and then went into some weird bible rant about something it says about marriage. I was shocked. Other customers were shocked. He just walked away muttering to himself. I get unsolicited comments all of the time, though. I am cashier. I think people would be amazed at some of the rude things people will say to a cashier just because they see my niceness as something more that what they should. People are willing to share some of the most personal shit with me just because they have my attention, and they know I can't get away. It gets weird at times."

"Not a woman so I won’t answer you. But reading all these comments and asking many girl friends these questions I came to the following phrase. Some might think it’s awkward and some might think it’s cute. But I guarantee that all of them will give you cues. So if you don’t have the social awareness to know when it’s time, ask. And if you don’t want to ask and don’t have the awareness, don’t do it. They will not be uncomfortable if you don’t do anything, but they will if you read the wrong cue. So don’t play the odds"

My young fella is an A grade student and Rep athlete but I have to say I can't take any credit, he just driven.

"I work in an office where the policy is first come,  first served, and one of my clients took a little longer than usual so I made an announcement that it was already an hour past my lunch break to those sitting in the waiting room.

Several months later my family and I were involved in a terrible car accident which totaled our truck. I live in a small town and people are always talking.

"Therapy. 

Asking myself why in particular I feel not good enough . Is that feeling legitimate or based strictly on my self esteem ? Can I do anything to become better at this? Does ""being good enough "" for a particular instance actually matter? Is someone telling me I am good enough and I am actively rejecting their opinion ? 

For me most of my ""I'm not good enough "" self esteem problems come from my own unrealistic expectations . I truly believed if I act x way , I can avoid y outcome - particularly with other people .

 Example , if I am nice to John , John won't be rude to me . If John was rude to me , I would blame myself and think I was not nice enough. 

Wrong. It is not my fault John decided to be an asshole . Once I realized I couldn't really control how others will perceive me it helped me stop being so harsh on myself. "

"This guy named Robbie I went to school with.

I was bullied a lot in school. Not good with social skills, smart, artistic, weird. I was basically a walking punchline at the time. 

Robbie’s friends were some of my worst bullies. But never Robbie. He was always so nice to me, I was suspicious. I thought the other shoe would drop and it never did. He’s just a %100 nice dude.

Ran into him a couple years ago. I was walking down a busy road and this car screeched over, and Robbie was hanging out the window, calling for me to stop so he could park and we could chat. He’s still a super nice dude. A very genuine person. Life is going very well for him (and for me; I grew out of my fucks and things got better).

"KVD. I honestly didn't know how gross of a person she was. I'm one of those people that don't pay too much attention to people's personal lives but after learning about all of the racist shit, on top of the anti-vaccine stuff, I just can't support her at all. I was so excited for her vegan stuff but nah."
"Ethnic Russian.

I hear ""Russian girls are beautiful"" a lot, or see it appear in comments on this site frequently, and there's just so many things wrong with it.

Firstly, by saying that I belong to a group of beautiful people you can then no longer compliment me by calling me beautiful. I'm literally accomplishing the bare minimum to be a member of my race by your standards.

Secondly, it makes me feel disposable and interchangeable with any other Russian.

Third, I'm a human being with my own personality and everything. Please don't water me down to a single quality.

Lastly, it's a huge country with many many people in it. You've got your Slavic people, your more Asian people, and everything in between. Plus the sheer law of averages means there have to be some absolutely hideous Russian women out there. Even those of us lucky enough to possess the Slavic anti-aging genes will hit 45 and turn into a babushka overnight."

"I love our bidet! I originally bought it because my boyfriend was using wipes and *always* accidentally flushed them, so after him clogging up the bathroom 3 times in 4 months I bought the bidet. $45 very well spent. I only wish I had splurged a little more and got the one that has a lady bits setting

Lol not sure why I was downvoted for this of all comments"
When I first started dating my SO I was a bit concerned about how he treated his immidiate family - always distant and not that helpful or considerate to them. I worried this was an issue because family is important and if he treats his family like that how is he going to treat me? He always said his family was horrible but to me they seemed okay. And now three years later I know his family very well and think my boyfriend is too nice to them and to considerate of them because they are awful. Just goes to show family isn't everything. 
"I totally understand. Some restaurants have an atmosphere that they want to uphold. I recently went out for a very expensive (3 Michelin) restaurant and it would have really ruined my night if there were screaming toddlers nearby. So, they limited kids under 10 to private rooms, which was a win for all involved."

"The $120 I spent on a proper outfit for job interviews. It’s silly that nice clothes can do such a number on my confidence, but wearing something well fitted that I know looks sharp during such an uncomfortable process just makes me feel so much better - and in turn I like to think it makes me perform better"
I like me even though I hate me. Somewhere in between self-loathing and self-love(?)
"1. Good quality knife (Wusthof Classic) and a knife sharpner (Pronto 4363)
2. I live in an apartment, a decent new shower head to replace the shitty apartment one
3. Smart thermostat (Sensi or Nest or whatever), not only it is very convenient to change temp form my phone. I save money. My max monthly bill has been 60 in last 3 years and my friends who have a smaller apartment then me have 80-100 at an average.
4. Anything breville if you use something they make frequently (unless a kitchenaid mixer). My Toaster oven does actual baking and my big oven is storage.
5. Thermoworks Thermometer, food is much better and delicious
6. Sous Vide cooker, pressure cooker, zojirushi rice cooker. The first one makes nice tender juicy meat, the second one makes quick meals, they third one makes good fluffy rice (2 weeks ago I made chicken biryani in it with premade sauce that came out very delicious and tender)
7. Electric toothbrush and flosser, the flosser is not the best way to floss, but I'm lazy and something is better than nothing.
8. Robot vacuum. 
7. Bidet and squatty potty"
My now husband asked to hold my hand and to kiss me the first few times. It was wonderful! I felt very considered. It can be hard to read body language for people you’re just getting to know! This is a great way to make sure the other person is just as into it as you are.

"I think they're designed for people in unfulfilling or perhaps even borderline toxic relationships who fantasize about having a more ideal one instead. 

This is something that mainly bothers me if the person in the dark that their partner is interested in another person is fundamentally a good person themselves and doesn't deserve to have this happen to them. But if the person the protagonist is with treats them badly or something like that, I don't really have much issue with it. "
"He adopted our friends kid the day we knew she was dying . He helped her through the process of wills and everything and made sure she didn't have to worry about the after.  She spent her last days being able to do her bucket list with her child, with money he provided. He set up a trust for her child with everything he had in his savings so that she can physically see that financially he was covered.

He asked her to write a book of her wishes for her son so that he can carry them out and raise him in a way that she would like. He helped her write letters and birthday cards for her son and they celebrate her birthday, mother's day, etc so that she is always a part of his life. "
"I live in the UAE, at a friends house party I got talking to two lovely sisters, it sounded like their family was bad-ass.  


They were at this pool party in super sexy dresses (classy sexy, they looked amazing), they told me all about their dad, who had passed away a few months before, and how liberal and open-minded he was. He basically sat them down and told them they could wear what they wanted and do what they wanted, so long as they were happy that's all he cared about, but also made sure they were aware of the reality that the people around them might make life hard for them if they didn't cover up, or if they drank alcohol etc but he'd always defend their choices.  


They told me that they're definitely seeing a change (in Abu Dhabi at least), because children are seeing in schools and stuff that Western teachers don't cover with an Abaya but still manage to dress respectfully, so it's like ""well, she's wearing that and she's not a bad person, so why can't I wear it too"".  


It made me so happy to hear this kind of story, and there are definitely a lot more similar - I met an awesome girl on a night out who was in a mini-skirt and crop top, also Emirati and she was like ""My parents don't like it but they've learned I'm going to do what I want"".  


I'm sorry you had to cut ties with your family, hopefully more people will start being more open-minded about women!"

My best friend got into it to pay for her cancer treatments/ med school. Shes been doing it for maybe 3 years (cancer is gone now). Makes on average 65-75k per year. She says the worst part is the heaps and heaps of cocaine. The best part was overtly wealthy regulars that would send her and friends on week long vacations to the bahamas. He never met them there. Never had any strings attached. 
Not anything close to a pro but I found if I want to wear a bold lip to put the lipstick on before I do eyes and face. I’ll put foundation on but then lips and then do eyes and cheeks so I don’t overdo my eyes.

Mine was similar: “You’re going to lose that figure when you have kids.”  That was from an older woman. And then my husband and both our kids walked up. That was satisfying. 
"My sister and I are strict about different things and lax about different things. Her kids are 8 and 4, my son is 3.  A lot of that is her children’s father, though. For instance, her kids’ father doesn’t like the word “poop,” a thing I found out about because I was laughing at my son and nephew screaming “poop” at each other. But I am more insistent about bedtimes, for example. I think we both try to walk the balance between making sure our kids are raised right with good manners and not being overbearing and too strict. I don’t think either of us are especially helicopter moms.

My brother’s daughter is still an infant so it’s harder to tell. I could see him being “fun dad” and all the discipline falling to his fiancée,which I hope he recognizes and fixes if it does happen.

"
Exactly the same thing happened to me.  He (27) asked to kiss me (23) for the first time. We are celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary next month!

"Clean your toilet.  We have to sit on them more than you do.  A lot of guys don't clean their toilets.  get a cleaning wand, clean the bowl and seat.  stuff laying around is a lot less gross than dirty things, if you get what I am saying.  Clean counters, old food, floors, dust.  

If you have a puzzle sitting on a table, or xbox controllers laying around I dont care as much as stuff being gunky.  

Also, when you live somewhere you get used to smells.  when someone else comes over, it is new to them.  I always ask close friends/family what smells bad in my pace so I can clean better. "

"Drinking Rosé. Actually, all things blush pink. I just redid my room and the “white” I chose? 100% blush. I have 6 bottles of rosé, a pink velvet comforter, and my phone case and planner are blush. I’m about to go buy a blush nude pump to replace my older yellow-undertoned pumps. 

ALL THINGS ROSÉ. 

I even started an Instagram to help me keep track of all the rosé we drink since we can never remember which is good or not. It’s called IsThisRoseOkay and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done in my life.

"Not a woman, but as a man who wears makeup almost every day and for stage:

- For the love of god, have a plan for what you're going to use. Makeup gets expensive fast and buying too much stuff you don't use is enough of a problem that there are whole subreddits devoted to swapping unused makeup. Don't just pick up stuff because you *may* need it; if you want to try a product, many stores will offer tiny samples or travel-sized (i.e. smaller and cheaper) versions of product.

- Get a good brush you dedicate for blending: one that's reasonably dense, doesn't lose bristles frequently, and ideally has a curved or dome shape (I use [this one](https://www.nyxcosmetics.com/pro-powder-brush/NYX_205.html) from NYX). Most of my other brushes are ELF or other $5-10 ones, but a good blending tool will pay for itself in a week.

- On blending: use a lighter touch. I had to train myself to remember that I'm dusting *individual particles*, not a single smear of contour/blush/bronzer/etc, and that when you do a light dusting instead of a forceful drag you wind up with a nicer fade of the lines and shadows on your face. The best general motion for blending is a brushing in a circular motion *along* the lines, which, along with a good brush, gives you more of an airbrushed picturesque look.

- If you want to make your eyes pop without the appearance of a ton of eyeliner, get a good waterproof crayon liner (I use Urban Decay's 24/7 Glide-on Eye Pencil, heard good things about Marc Jacobs liner too) in a *dark/light brown shade* and put it just in the *outside corners* of both eyes' waterlines (i.e. the little ""ledge"" on your lower eyelid; go for a solid line on the very corner and then fade out to a softer one by about a third of the way along the waterline). This essentially creates the same effect as regular eyeliner (i.e. making your eyes pop by adding a contrasting colour), but it looks more like just a darker shadow than makeup, and also draws more attention to the centre of your eyes and makes them appear larger and brighter.

- Know what products last longer than others and what you'll be refilling regularly. For me, bronzer, blush, and contour and eye shadow palettes can last for months or even over a year, so it's worthwhile to go to Sephora and splurge on a good one. On the other hand, I'm always running out of foundation, concealer, primer and setting spray, so I'm a bit more frugal there (although I do still have a $40 setting spray because I can get it online and it's just that good; check out Skindinavia's stuff online). Also, some products, notably mascara, expire regularly and need to be replaced every few months regardless (especially mascara, as it's near your eyes and can lead to an eye infection if you share it or use it after its expired).

- **Build up coverage**. If you want to know how people seemingly get perfectly blended lines and eye shadow, a big part of the reason is because they build up their lines and colours over time (this is also, partly, why eye shadows and contour are sold as palettes). As a general rule with eye shadow and contour, start with a lighter colour closer to your skin and gradually go darker, using less and less the darker you get. Also, keep blending as you go.

- Recognize that products aren't *only* for one thing. Unless you're putting stuff near your eyes and mouth, there's nothing stopping you from using different products for different reasons. I've used white foundation mixer as highlight; I use eye shadow to colour in my beard; I use bronzer to contour every day, etc. Once you start practicing you'll see the effects of various products, and once you start looking at faces you like, you'll see the aesthetics you can mimic.

I should stop here because I'll run out of time otherwise. Good luck!"

"My uncle, who is pushing 80, has to give up his house and he and his wife are being forced to move in with my cousin. They're getting booted because he hasn't worked in forever and they've blown through all of their savings. He asked my dad and the rest of his siblings for money, because as their eldest brother he is Head of the Family now and demands compensation. The collective answer from my dad's side of the family is ""you can go fuck yourself."" And why is this? Because a decade-ish ago, when my grandma was dying, this uncle took over her power of attorney to help her out. And when she died, it was discovered that uncle had completely drained the trust that was intended to go to all of her children. He'd stolen every dime. And there was nothing they could do about it, because he had POA and grandma hadn't specified about the trust in her will. So basically nobody feels bad for him that he can't make payments on his hoarder house anymore.

According to my mom, when uncle called dad to ask for money, dad basically just laughed for like 5 minutes and then hung up on him."

If I’m spending $400 for a quiet evening of adult conversation, chill atmosphere, and ambiance- I don’t want it interrupted by a crying baby, or a kid kicking the back of my booth, or climbing over into my booth, or cackling and screeching as some kids do.

Now, I know some kids are well behaved, but it’s easier to say “no kids” than only “some kids”. 

People may argue that adults can be disruptive too- but you can talk to an adult, you can kick an adult out, you get a lot more flack for telling a parent they have to leave because of their screaming kid. 🙄"
"So my little sister was going to move in with her online girlfriend. They were going to live together in girlfriend's family's condo right on Myrtle Beach, rent free, while girlfriend worked on her master's degree. They were talking about it for months and months, making plans and everything.

So the day finally comes. Little sister packs up mom's car and they drive from Texas to Myrtle Beach over the course of two days. They get to the house, and girlfriend has a freaking meltdown. She says she can't handle that much change, and little sister can't move in with her after all. She won't even let little sister and Mom in the house, she turns them away before they even get inside.

So Mom and little sister, after driving for two days, had to turn around and drive to Mom's house. Little sister is stuck there now, because she ended her lease and quit her job and sold her furniture because she was supposed to move in with girlfriend.

"My sister-in-law's life is coming apart at the seams.  

She's realizing she married the wrong person for the wrong reasons, and now doesn't want to divorce him because it would mean admitting she was wrong.

Her poor spending and job choices are finally catching up to her.  She spends money like it's going to disappear if she doesn't and several times has just walked out of jobs with no backup plan for really petty reasons.

And she's realizing that because she moved 1000 miles away from her friends and family to live with her husband, she has no support system in place to help her deal with these issues.

And I'm just sitting back and basking in the schadenfreude.

There's an even better one brewing though.

My wife's grandmother is a really sweet old lady and I love her to death.  She was also very much the type who believed the husband was the head of the household and it was her job to support his decisions.  They own a pretty decent sized farm in the Midwest.  A few hundred acres.  And because grandpa was a farmer, he was never comfortable leaving the farm to travel, so grandma never got to travel either.

Now my wife's aunts and uncles are all fairly bad with money and a lot of them are planning their retirements around selling the farm when grandma dies.  What most of them don't know is that grandma has already sold the farm and is spending her few remaining years blowing through that money to go see as much of the world as she can before she dies.

I so badly want to be there when they all find out."

Those things combined made me think he would be nothing more than a one night stand, but both turned out to be false, so I have no choice but to marry him 🤷🏻‍♀️"

"I love it when people seek consent, though with minor things like the ones you mention I don’t think it’s personally necessary for myself.

For kissing or more overtly sexual activities, that’s where I personally want to exchange clearer communication around consent. 

However, I remind that there are many creative and natural ways to do seek consent that aren’t just “do you want to do this” or “May I do this?” "
"My sister and I have totally different parenting styles. I vax, she doesnt. She spanks, I dont. She is more hands off and prefers staying at home on weekends with the kids, whereas we are always on the go . "
"I haven’t the faintest idea how my brother raises his children now, though I suspect it’s similar to how we were raised. I haven’t had any contact with him in years. He uses physical discipline and is focused on making sure his daughters are good, subservient Christian girls who closely follow traditional gender roles. He was very homophobic and I doubt that’s improved with age, so he is probably passing that mindset on to his kids. He’s not a huge believer in science or anything else that isn’t written explicitly in the Bible. 

I don’t believe in spanking. I don’t force any spiritual beliefs on my daughter, instead I let her explore her own feelings about things and encourage her to be openminded. I’m a scientist so most of my beliefs are evidence-based although I’m also open to the possibility of just about anything. Just because there are things we cannot explain or understand doesn’t mean they aren’t real. I’m teaching my daughter to be strong and to stand up for her beliefs while also being respectful of the beliefs of others. 

Essentially, I’m very liberal and he’s very conservative and our parenting styles reflect those beliefs. "

"I was on the top floor of a double decker bus, heading home from work, and I was pretty much decided that I was going to commit suicide when I got in. Everything was awful, I hated my job, I didn’t know how to ask for help, I was completely invisible. 
So I was sat on the bus, which had stopped at some traffic lights; I was leaning against the window and I picked my nose. A good old root around in the old nasal cavity to get out the enormous bogey that was bothering me. I was so invisible, no one was going to notice me anyway, so who cared if I was being so gross in public?
I heard a shout outside the window, “hey!”
I glanced down, and this man about my age was pointing up at me. Our eyes met.
“You’ll have your eye out if you’re not careful!” He shouted, and grinned at me, this enormous friendly conspiratorial grin. 
My face split into an answering grin and I laughed involuntarily, just one rusty sounding “ha!”. I withdrew my finger from my nose and put my hand back in my lap. I shrugged at him. He grinned at me again and walked off - the traffic lights changed and the bus pulled away in the opposite direction. 

He saw me. He saw me and he spoke to me. So the next day, I called in sick and went to the doctors where I got some help for my depression. It took a while, but now I am on top of it. Thanks, random man."

"An elderly woman walking home with her groceries in the midmorning summer heat. She was walking in my direction and I was running very slowly in hers. I had just started running in the past couple of months and was really struggling with it. I was also struggling with anxiety, my self-esteem, and was a little overweight still. I didn't know anybody but my husband at the time. I had been hunting for a job in my new city for months with no callbacks. As I was nearing her, she gave me an old-lady fistpump, a brilliant grin, and told me ""you go, honey, you look so strong!"".I feel like that was the turning point for me in running, and subsequently in managing my anxiety, raising my self-esteem level, and getting to a healthier weight. I will never forget her."

Toxic is toxic. Abusive is abusive. The ""sweep it under the rug"" and ""keep it in the family"" mentality just hurts victims and gives abusers the rest of that victim's life.

"You don’t need to get a brush for every single product you own! I tried 4 different styles of foundation brush, and 2 types of sponges, and it turns out I like the natural coverage and finish I get with my fingers best. Bonus: my hands are much easier to clean than any brush or sponge. "
"This guy my sister worked with is a big-deal in his industry, he wrote a book that my dad read and thought was brilliant and he made the rest of us read it too.  


One of the key take-aways (and granted lots of people say this but it was my first time reading it so had the biggest impact) is that what happens to us is out of our control, how we react to it is. Are you going to let that person you cut you off in traffic ruin your day? Or are you going to say ""that was shit of them"" and carry on with things  


In your example, what can you do about the slow moving lady? She's not going to speed up, you can choose to get upset about it, or you can - as you did - realise that this isn't the end of the world and move on with your day.  


It's helped me a lot in stressful situations at work, in relationships etc, just take a breather for 5 seconds and think about what's going on, is it a big deal? or is it something easy to manage that was just unexpected? How do you handle it.  


It also helps me (sorry, I'm going on a rant now), I have a very mild touch of anxiety, I tend to overthink if I mess up with work - so sometimes if I feel overwhelmed I pause and ask if I'm really going to remember this moment in 5 years, the answer probably not. It helps."
"It probably remains the comment that makes me the most angry of just about anything. I was sitting on a bench in the hallway of the ONCOLOGY ward where my dad was receiving palliative care. He was days away from dying- the nurses had given us all pamphlets on ""what to expect when someone is dying"" (seriously). I just needed a breather. So I went into the hallway. 

This guy comes down the hallway from who knows where and claps me on the shoulder and says ""cheer up, it can't be that bad"" and then proceeds to keep walking towards the elevators. I was actually speechless. but to this day I wish I could have followed him and chewed him out. Who says that to someone? Who says that to someone sitting in an oncology ward? 

It still bothers me. "
"Not in-laws, but I was living with my best friend, his mom was my landlord. My family disowned me, my car got totalled, and I was three months behind on rent. 

His mom took me to dinner, told me ""look. You don't owe me back rent, you won't owe me rent as long as I own this house, and here's $5k no strings attached for a new car. Also, please join us for Thanksgiving next month""

I've never felt more like part of a family, even when I was in my old family. It's the single biggest life changing event I've ever experienced. My biggest hope now is that I get married before she passes, so she can be my mom at my wedding. Dammit I'm tearing up writing this out :) "
"I think it’s going to be great, but it also brings assholes out of the woodwork. So many “ANOTHER female super hero??” commenters in the Star Wars and MCU world who are fine with the hero being a dude as a default but find it to be “pandering” if the movie is not to the gender they belong to. Why do women always have to see things from a woman or man’s perspective, but asking to see from a woman’s perspective makes them disinterested or bored? It’s sad.

I also hope that the more women are showcased, the more flawed, varied, and realistic they can become. "
"I don't really understand why people think that near-naked body pics are required to be able to see basically how fit someone is. Wearing well-fitting clothes is fine, imo. There doesn't need to be any weird cloak-and-dagger behavior to try to find a sneaky way to show off your body."
"I’m a kidnapping victim when drunk. I’m very social and outgoing when I’m drunk and for some reason it’s very easy to just convince me to “go check something out” or some guys just grab me by the hand and lead me out. 

At this one bar the same bouncer must work every Saturday because it was always him that saved me. I’ve seen him stop other women before and save them too. 

He would ask the guy where he was going. Usually the guy would say something like “oh she’s drunk just getting my friend home sir” and then the bouncer would stop the woman and ask her what the man who is taking her name is and where she thinks she is going. If she didn’t know the guys name or the story didn’t add up, he would grab the girl and give her to the inside bouncer and kick the guy out. 

Usually the bouncer would give the woman a stern warning before releasing you. But he’s super nice. 

But I’m no longer a kidnap victim as I’ve learned to control public drinking (this was back when I was 21). Also I keep a healthy dose of paranoia when drinking. But I credit that bouncer a lot for keeping me safe when i was 21 and partying in college. "
"""If I'm not happy now, when will I be?""

I asked myself this when I was crying for no real reason.  I was married to the man I love, pregnant with my first child and living in the mountains with no serious financial worries.  That was when I realized that to some extent, happiness is a choice- one I had never learned to make.

"He tends to take a backseat in conversations... a lot. I took it as a lack of interest or not paying attention. My mother, especially, found this infuriating.

Turns out that it was because of multiple factors: his hearing (he has really bad hearing, especially in one of his ears, and often couldn't hear or understand what was being said), insecurity (he would think of something to contribute but didn't want to interrupt, but often would never get a word in), and just plain not knowing what to say. He tends not to really chime in unless he feels what he has to say is worth the effort -- which, understandably, means one of his absolute pet peeves is being talked over, or never getting a chance to speak when he DOES want to add something. I make a point of keeping an eye on him or adding a break in a conversation so he can have his piece because I know he's not the type to ruffle feathers.

However, he is *always* paying attention, even when it's a conversation that I know down in my heart must not be that interesting to him. My sister and I adore BL, and we would fangirl over certain things, particularly visual novels. I would fangirl with my boyfriend about what was happening in one, or which characters I like... despite him never having played it. I couldn't help myself, I was just excited about it! It would have made perfect sense for him to nod politely and tune me out. But nope - he can identify them by face and name and got me figurines of the two he knows I pair together as a Christmas gift :)"

I came back to it three months later, having researched other ways of folding it for insertion that weren’t listed on the pamphlet. Well, the new fold changed everything — it just clicked. I haven’t used anything else in almost 10 years, and it’s one of the best things that ever happened to me. 

So, my advice is only.. give it a whirl, wear pantiliners or pads as a back-up until you’re fairly confident you have the hang of it, and if one fold doesn’t work for you, try a different one. "
"I worked at strip clubs on and off for a few years. There are good nights and bad nights. It's a real drain on your social life; most clubs require you to work at least 3 nights a week, at least one of which needs to be a Friday or Saturday. And you've got to keep in mind that strippers are a dime a dozen. You look at the wrong manager the wrong way or don't tip a waitress because she was rude and they'll tell you to get your things and get out before your thong is back on. I've also seen girls who were told they couldn't work until they lost some weight, but never any complaints about tattoos or piercings.

It can be lucrative, but it can also take a toll on your psyche. You have to deal with a lot of rejection in a short time frame - sometimes you'll ask every guy in the club and get no dances. Then you wait for some new meat in the door and try again. You'll also want to be able to explain the gap in employment on your resume to future employers, unless you're holding down a second job, which can be tough. And finally, you have to spend money to make money. New shoes, costumes, makeup, hair, etc. That stuff doesn't come cheap. 

Feel free to ask me anything specific."

"I think certain establishments should be allowed to restrict based on age if they deem it necessary, and restaurants fall into that category.

The thing is, not everything is child or baby friendly, and that's not always an issue of ""discriinating"" against children or families.  I'd say ""think about bars, or R-rated movies,"" but honestly, some clueless people think those should be free and open to babies and children too.  

People who take their children to these types of establishments and events usually justify it by saying ""my child is ready to experience this"" or ""how else will he learn to behave"" or ""do you expect my life to halt just because I'm a parent?""  And the thing is, these people are not thinking for one hot second about what their child wants or needs.  They're only thinking about what they want, and how they don't want to stop ""living their lives.""  (Apparently, ""life"" only happens in r-rated movies, loud bars, and fancy restaurants.  How tedious.)  Kids don't belong in these places.  They don't just not belong there because other people don't want them there, because they might act up, or because it's straight up inappropriate, but because *they don't want to fucking be there.*  I've worked in bars and seen enough kids sleeping in booths and whining ""maaaaaahm daaaaaad can we goooooo?"" while the parents slam back cocktails and play pub trivia.  

No, your life doesn't have to end when you have kids.  But you do need to adjust it at least until your kid can be left home alone every so often.  And there are plenty of child only places or ""family"" places that are pretty narrow in what their definition of a family is (as in, they cater exclusively to soccer moms with kids between two and six), so idk.  If I can't climb on the playscape at the mall (which yes, I *do* want to do), then your kid shouldn't be entitled to a bar at midnight or a $200 a plate restaurant just because you want it."
"I used to be suicidal, literally kept what I needed to do it in a drawer next to my bed and was just waiting for the right time. I was depressed, so tired, hated everyone and everything...the world and everyone in it was a mean terrible place and I could not wait to get out. 

Then a few different people I knew actually did kill themselves and my attitude just changed dramatically. I started living in the moment completely. Enjoying every day as my right as a human being. Like happiness was my god given right and I owed it to myself. I have Graves disease, chronic anemia, breast cancer and issues with PMDD. I got a raw deal like that. So I'm going to become my own fairy godmother now. 

If I want to eat eggplant parmigiana, thats exactly what I do. If I want to get a tattoo, I do it immediately. If I want a croisant from my favorite patisserie, I go and get it. Right now, my hair is exactly the way I have always wanted it.  , bleached blonde Marilyn Monroe copy cat and completely out of my comfort zone. I've wanted to wear it like this since I was 13 years-old and now I did it. If I get down, I think about what I want to do that will make me happy. Italian food? New lipstick? A new book? A good stiff drink? 

This is just how I'm dealing right now. "

"I came out publicly (along with about 8 other women) against a locally well-known business man calling him out for his sexual harassment and abuse of employees. I was on TV, a candidate for the senate wrote the one and only negative article about me (and it was seriously a very strange article) which caused the newspaper to receive dozens and dozens of letters (most they published) in support of me. I was actually quite surprised about the support but apparently this boss's behavior was a surprise to no one. All the advertisers (well, maybe 70&amp;#37;) pulled out of the magazines he owned. He was forced to sell his company for very cheap. There were two weeks where every single day an article was published about the whole ordeal.

I don't really have much drama in my life at all, but these past 2 months have I hope, filled my quota for the rest of my life.

In family drama, my sisters ex husband who remarried, cheated on his current wife with an 18 year old (he is 40) who is mentally disabled. Someone from their church. Most of my family are Jehovahs Witnesses and that alone was pretty scandalous, but what made it extra awesome was that the current wife ATTACKED the poor girl IN CHURCH (no injuries, just a stupid physical altercation). It was mortifyingly redneck to my classy parents, and my father is an elder in their congregation. I fucking love this story."
"Primark. The management kicked my sister and her carer (she has EDS and dislocates/sublaxes easily so needs help getting dressed sometimes) out of the disabled changing rooms so a woman they deemed more worthy could use it (she had a broken leg).

Her carer (who is amazing) was all ready to kick off about it, but my sister was so embarrassed and at this point sick/sad of people doubting that she has a disability that she convinced her to just leave. My sister is a disabled single mum who had a rare opportunity to spend some birthday vouchers on clothes for herself for a change and she ended up going home in tears. Fuck Primark."
"I'll be honest, I didn't know stovetop kettles were modern items. I thought they were like old timely things on TV to show period, like a gramophone"
I'm assuming a lot of those restaurants are more upscale and adult oriented and are probably not very appropriate for children. Most of the people eating there probably don't want to be disturbed by loud kids - including parents who are paying for a babysitter so they can have a nice date night! I think it's common sense that there are some spaces kids are best left out of but a lot of people seem to be oblivious to this (or just inconsiderate of others). There are plenty of family friendly restaurants all over the place that are better suited for kids -from the menu options to having more floor space and activities to do while they wait for food. 
"For me it was exactly the other way around. I was horrified how he talked with his mother at the phone or how he, when we visited her, just let her do household stuff while sitting on the couch. I thought he was an asshole and incosiderate and I was mortified how he'd treat me when we at some point moved in together.

Turns out, I am unnaturally tiptoeing around my own mother. Telling your mom that you can't talk, because you have a girl over is NORMAL and not disrespectful, so is relaxing when you're at your mom's, because she'll tell you if she needs help and wants you to have a good time. If I did any of these I'd be up for a 30 minute screaming tirade and as a child maybe even being chased around the house until caught and then slapped until my mom's hand was tired.

After moving in, I learned that I was acting weird and that in fact my family has not been a ""bit straining"" but straight up abusive. 

We share the work at home just fine. He's a responsible and caring person and his mom and he simply have healthy boundaries. "

"If you mean in general: Vaccines don't cause autism and even if they did, autism isn't scarier than death.

If you mean specific to being a woman: The whole ""men are inherently more logical, women are inherently more emotional"" thing is a lie. Not only is everyone using both simultaneously regardless of gender, but men and women actually have more similarities than differences. It just doesn't seem that way because studies that show differences between the two are more popular because they're more shocking and more likely to be published because they get more readers. "
"I think there's a complete mesh of culture and religion. Women and men are both equally, as per the book but when culture and patriarchy sets in, it's becomes convoluted and messed up!  How men are told that they superior to women. Examples that I've seen personally: 

At house parties, they get to eat first, even if the women slave away in the kitchen all day... bizzare. 

If the man does his share of the housework (as he should!), the woman is told ""why do you make him work so hard""? ... my response: because he also lives in the house.

"Hi! I'm  professional makeup artist, hopefully you find a few of these helpful. I'll try and keep this short :) 

•Firstly, if you have beautiful skin, show it off! 
The less is more approach is a winner.  
A primer or moisturizer with a soft shimmer can look really beautiful on its own or with foundation.  

•If you have trouble getting your foundation to last all day, make sure that you are setting it. 

•*Use a good eyeshadow primer on your eyes!!!*

•Warm your mascara up before applying, to get it to go on smooth and without clumps - I put mine under my arm, between my legs or in my bra when I'm doing my makeup and add it last. 

•Spraying a light spray (such as rosewater or Mac Fix+) on your brush after you've loaded up your eyeshadow will help the colour show more, and last longer. 

•Invest in a couple of good quality brushes and a couple of good quality products.  
Good brushes can be expensive, but if you look after them they can last *years* and make such a difference. Ive got some I use almost daily that I've had for 8 years and counting.  

•A guideline (but not necessarily a rule)  is to have one main focus at a time. Ie, statement eyes, more subtle lips, or, bold lips, more subtle eye. 

Hope that helps,  happy to answer questions if I can :)"

"I read a while back about saying “Thank you” instead. It puts the emotional burden back on you and instead of making them feel bad because you feel bad, you’re acknowledging their good work &amp; making them feel good as well.

So instead of saying,”I’m sorry I made this or that mistake” I try to say,”Oh, I see! Thank you for pointing it out. Your input is really helpful!”

"Personally, I don’t like being asked because it increases the pressure to respond positively. Sometimes I like the person but it’s too early for me to kiss them, and then explaining that to them feels inorganic. 

I prefer it when dates can read my body language. Start small with a gentle hand graze. Is my hand still there, or have I now stuffed them into my pockets? Am I initiating more or less physical contact then before?

Another good sign is when my body is angled directly towards or into you. In quieter and romantic moments when a kiss is possible, am I making eye contact or averting gaze? 
 
My body cues tell more than I can possibly verbalize. If you still feel stumped or confused, then please ask. Some people have a history of abuse and may have boundaries you are unaware of.

"i think the closest equivalent would be chasing people who weren't into me, outright said they didn't want a relationship (with me), but i chose to ignore what they said and focus on the ''signs'' (we have sex! they *act* like they love me!). i stayed and gave and gave and gave ''selflessly'' and had my heart broken.

it took a lot of time to realize that it wasn't selfless. i wanted it to pay off. i wanted them to turn around and realize they loved me someday, just like nice guys dream. yeah it wasn't cool of the people taking advantage of it, but ultimately it was my fault for not having boundaries or self respect."

"My current boyfriend. We met over two years ago at a house party. I was hanging in the kitchen with some friends when I noticed him just chilling alone. I went over to strike up a conversation and we ended up talking for literally four hours. We talked about everything. Books, movies, politics, hobbies etc. He never once tried to hit on me or be sleazy. At one point, when I realized how long we had been chatting I apologized profusely and told him I’d let him get back to his friends, to which he replied “Oh, my friends left hours ago. I just didn’t want to leave because I was having such a good time talking with you!”  He asked me for my phone number and if he could take me on a date sometime. He walked me out of the party and took me to dinner two nights later. I knew he was different from everyone else that very night. He was just so genuine and nice. 

Another moment that really struck me to just how wonderful of a human being he was happened a few months back. We had plans to go out one night when he texted saying he was going to be late. Apparently on his walk to my place, he came upon a disabled woman in a wheelchair who was lost. He stayed with her and helped figure out where her hotel was. He walked with her all the way to the hotel and waited until her caretaker came down to make sure she was safe. He then called me apologizing nonstop because he felt so bad for being late for our date. Like, how could I be mad about that??

We’re moving into our first home together in two weeks. "

"I don't know that any of the orange flags with my husband turned out to be *truly* innocuous, but that were a lot that I misinterpreted.  

On our first date, he seemed *really* disinterested...as in, I was the one carrying the entire conversation, and every time I'd try to ask him a question, I'd get a one word response.  I'd literally never been on a date with somebody who seemed less interested in me, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why he called later that night, pushing to see me again.

The good news is, dude liked me!  Turns out, he was *super* interested...so interested that he was too nervous to say anything.

The bad news is, it turns out that his anxiety wasn't exactly a one-time fluke.  He often gets nervous around people, and his coping mechanism is to basically sit back with his arms crossed, looking hella disinterested in everyone.  So uh, yeah.  Lots of fun trying to bring him to social events. Tends to go super well. 

Flags are flags.  I'd say that 90% of the time, red flags mean *something*, just because all of things a person does do indeed tell you *something* about them.  But, the key is to remember that those early moments are just a snapshot of who the person is, and a single photograph rarely tells the whole story."
Walmart. For not paying their employees a livable wage and [for allowing one of their stores to be made into a holding center for immigrant children. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Padre) 
"I live in the American south, so it took me a while to realize that even if someone doesn't like it, they'll still hang out with you and be friendly. 


Tldr: probably a lot of people, but they'll take that secret to the grave. "
"We met through a (now) ex friend. He's genuinely the nicest, most helpful, kindest man I've ever met. He was always there for me, and he helped me become a much better person. He's always very respectful to everyone, and he's also a very smart, interesting man. 

I fell in love with him over the course of 4 years, despite identifying as a lesbian, and now we're dating. "
Buy a first aid kit with the basics. It’s really rough when you need one and have to go to the store. I learned this the hard way and had to go to the store while I looked like a cut up bruised mess from a fall. Also this include cold medicine. It’s sucks when you have one and can’t move yet still have to go to the store. 
"When I was about 20, I was having a really rough go with an undiagnosed depression/anxiety program. I was flying out to see my (now ex) boyfriend at boot camp and had a meltdown at the DFW airport. I couldn’t get on the plane I was supposed to be on, because the claustrophobia was making me panic. So I called my dad just bawling and wailing and he put my mom on the next flight out so she could drive me home. 

Problem was, her flight didn’t land for 6 hours and I had no luggage. I just had my carryon with some meds and my wallet. So some airport lady helped me get a hotel room nearby and I stayed there until my moms flight was supposed to land. 

When I caught the shuttle back to the airport, I learned her flight had been delayed by about 45 minutes and it just broke me. I had no more energy to keep myself together. This really nice female soldier (in uniform) came up to me and asked if I was okay and I didn’t have the strength to explain the whole thing. I could only get out “I need my mother and her flight is late” between sobs. 

She lead me over to a nearby bench and told me she would sit with me until my mom got there so I wouldn’t have to wait alone. That was the nicest thing a stranger could’ve done for me and although I didn’t get her name, I will never forget her. "
Ever went back and thanked them?
“Hey white girl want a little Asian in ya!?” Out loud across an entire room full of other Asian guys at a computer cafe back when they had those. My boyfriend at the time was Asian and asked me to come watch him play counter strike. I was 16 and mortified is not an adequate word. Since then on a regular basis I’ve thought of things I could have/should have said back to him.
"Same boat, I can’t wait to get passed the burning black candles at midnight and writing letters to Dear Abbey stage. Let me know what you find out. "

"Nothing healthy, really. I generally delete things off my phone (social media/dating apps) or remove people I haven't talked to in awhile. Smoke weed, ugly cry, create sad girl playlists. "
"It's likely that I loved some professors who probably weren't too thrilled with me. I did well gradewise, but doodled a lot in class, texted frequently, rarely made eye contact when answering questions, showed up late with coffee, all the ""obnoxious student"" things that any teacher or professor hates."
oh.... my heart 
"A friend of mine stripped for money.  She and her family were poor, her only parent was disabled and unable to work, and it was the quickest way she knew to make cash.

In her own words, she wasn't completely comfortable with stripping, so she resorted to using drugs and alcohol at work.  (No dude wants an anxious, uncomfortable stripper.)  That seriously cut into her earnings, and she realized that she could make the same amount as a waitress at a decent place so she did that.

For clarity's sake, she made less money overall as a waitress but didn't have to get high/drunk to work, so she more than broke even."
"She somewhat recently posted on instagram about how she’s going to give birth naturally, raise her child vegan, etc. Nothing controversial until she said she would not be vaccinating her kid. Naturally the internet did not take this well and it was a hot topic the following week. "
"&gt;I am glad he finally found a girl and is happy now.

"Cannot upvote this enough! UV damage ages you. Protecting against UV damage, with either physical or chemical sunscreen, will help you look younger for longer. And even if you are in your 30s, 40s, etc and haven't ever used sunscreen before on your face, starting now can help reverse some of the damage that's already been done to your skin (according to new studies). 

Physical sunscreen is my favorite for the face because it doesn't burn or sting as much as chemical sunscreen. 

If all you ever do is go to work and go home, a foundation with at least SPF 30 is fine for you. If you plan on being outdoors for more than that - saying going to kid's soccer game, playing golf, etc - you'll need more than just foundation because it's not something we put on thick enough to be effective for more prolonged exposure. Try a moisturizer with SPF under your makeup in those situations - or sunscreen made for the face."
"I was traveling by myself for the first time in Paris. I was completely unprepared. I had no money or map or any idea how to get where I was going. I just started crying on the street corner. A group of four English speaking women walked past me. Then they came back and said “if our daughters were crying on the street corner, we would really hope someone would stop and help.” They got me to the hostel and gave me some money for food. I don’t know what I would have done with out that help.

"I have bartended at strip clubs in the past. It was very lucrative. Sometimes the patrons would rather a conversation with a “clothed” girl. They saw bartenders as less threatening and/or intimidating. Some nights I made more than the dancers (they usually hate the bartenders for that reason). I wore booty shorts, fishnets and essentially a bra. "
"On girls: mom jeans, crop tops, birkenstocks, tube tops, dewy makeup, false eyelashes (the natural ones, worn daily)... celebration of natural/curly hair

On guys: this isn’t really a widespread “trend”, it occurs in certain subcultures in my city, so i don’t know if it counts... but guys growing out their hair, wearing rings, and painting their nails. It might sound sus but it’s the norm for some subcultures in South FL, Texas, and Cali and i love it and i’ll be sad when it dies down. 

I don’t know if it’s a widespread trend, but I’ve noticed in teens and young adults, it’s becoming more and more common to discuss mental health like depression, anxiety, and slowly conversation is turning towards bipolar disorder and others. I feel like it’s leading to the destigmatization of mental illnesses, especially in Generation Z and millennials.  "
"Definitely-a then new male friend in college 12 years ago. my roommate and I were going to meet up with him, to watch fireworks on Independence Day. Plans changed a bit the day of, as my roommate’s disabled client she worked for had never been to see fireworks, and we knew we HAD to take her.

We informed our new friend of the change and told him he could meet us there instead of carpooling, since we didn’t know how long it would take to work out all the details with the client’s residential living nurse and night staff.

Instead, new friend asked if he could help us get the client there. So he helped coordinate, push and carry the very heavy wheelchair, and find a suitable place we could all watch comfortably. He really went out of his way to give the client a wonderful experience. 

Not long after we started dating. Then I married him. He is still just as kind and goes out of his way to help people. "
"When I was 11, my aunt passed away from cancer and I was unable to attend her funeral. I was really sad about the whole thing, like one usually is, we had been fairly close growing up and she was really lovely. I was taking the city bus home like usual and a nice woman in an A&amp;W uniform started talking to me, and asked what was wrong. We had a really good talk about remembering the good parts of my aunts life and that it’s ok to feel sad for a while. Basically I just felt really listened to then, and she spoke to me like an equal instead of some young kid. I don’t remember her name but I’ll always remember that interaction. "
"This happened to me too. I was looking down over a huge gorge, somewhere in the SW US. It’s a pretty popular one but I forget the name. It felt like I’d been standing there on the edge of the bridge forever, kicking stones off, when someone came up behind me and started talking to me. He was a painter, and he gave me his business card. He said he was painting the gorge, but every now and then I check in on his social media and I’ve never seen any of the gorge paintings. Part of me thinks he was just looking out for someone he thought wanted to jump."

"Gonna get my english-grad points taken away but I'm actually rereading The Giver, because I first read it for school when I was 12 and I wasn't interested in it at all, and also I wasn't a terribly bright kid. I understand it much better now, but I also think that's partly from having an adult perspective and understanding what exactly is wrong in this society and where those problems came from."

"Barilla pasta, because their chairman said that they are against having gays in their ads because its not the ""traditional family"" and he also straight up said ""If gays don't like it, they can buy another brand of pasta."" So I do.

Also, Nestle, which is hard bc they own soooooo many brands it's ridiculous. But they're stealing CA's water, which is already an extremely finite resource here. Literally, people here have gone without running water in their wells for weeks and weeks at a time. And I probably don't need to tell you why not having water is detrimental to an AG state. 

And Walmart bc, well, it's Walmart. Treating employees like garbage, shitty products, etc.

Also, i guess the meat and dairy industries. But I won't get into that. 

That's all i can think of right now. There are some people, definitely most have been listed already, but these are the first that came to mind. 

Edit to add:
Chick-fil-a, bc they're disgustingly homophobic and actually fund conversion therapy. Idk how I forgot about them. 

Hobby Lobby, also homophobes and against birth control. I don't believe a corporation should get to have religious views. The people in charge, sure. Whatever. But they should not be able to subject their employees to their religious beliefs.

"The one sibling of the 5 I have that has children does not have the same parenting style as mine. I am open with my children. But I also have high expectations and boundaries for them. I take my kids everywhere, camping, hiking, vacations, out to eat and they know how to behave and do well in public. 

My sibling thinks it's too hard and prefers to not take the kids anywhere. "
"Don’t wait, this could be their last week on the job, those are the kind of decisions that people carry with them wondering if they made the right choice or if someone is rotting in jail because of their call, please tell them. "
"I think our instincts are similar. But my kid doesn’t respond to strictness and a heavy hand. Her older kid doesn’t need a heavy hand. Her younger kid has psychiatric problems and will need a behavior plan I matter where she goes for the rest of her life. She completely falls apart without constant supervision and definitions of what’s acceptable and what’s not. 

So most of the differences are based on the kid’s needs. "

"A  12 pound weighted blanket. Feels amazing when wrapped around me and significantly helps with my anxiety and insomnia.

"I have had IBS-D for over two decades...it's not life-threatening diarrhea, but it makes for embarrassing situations.  I plan every day, where I'll be, how long away from a bathroom, where the nearest bathroom will be, etc...

I travel for work as well, so I have to factor being in airports and on planes.  I have a travel ""protocol"" which dictates what I can eat within 24 hours of travel.  

It's draining to always be on guard.  Not a day goes by when I don't wonder how a food, drink, activity, appointment, errand, will impact or be impacted by my condition."
Something about this was just so sweet and elegant. Perfectly put!

"The differences between you and your brother sound a lot like the difference between my parents' parenting style and that of my aunt and uncle. My siblings and I were outside all the time, taking care of our pets, playing with our friends, etc., but my parents always encouraged reading and learning, and would never tell us to stop reading if we were really into a book (and had nothing else we ought to be doing). My aunt was the same except she didn't like her kids ""sitting around and reading"" and would sort of herd them outside. We all turned out pretty much the same, with a love of the outdoors, good manners and good work ethic - but my cousins, now adults, never read unless they have to. My siblings and I still love books, and I'm really grateful that my parents let me embrace my bookworm tendencies as a kid. "

"I'm a loner and an introvert, but not a homebody. 

Day off - wake up later than normal (8AM/9AM) and then probably go out. I'm helping my sister decorate her house, so I spend a lot of time looking at decor. I like going to the library and browsing. I sometimes go to a coffee shop and just stay there for a while with my laptop. At night, I like to go out eat, to a movie, to get cocktails, etc. I love going on walks around cute towns and getting lunch or ice cream, too. If I stay home, I like taking baths, watching Netflix, reading, and doing random crafty things. "
I just wanted to pop in here and say the fact that you remain good friends with several exes also speaks nicely of you!  
"Something that is super hot is when someone just says what’s on their mind. Instead of “Can I kiss you?” I love things like “I really want to kiss you right now/I feel like I want to hold your hand/It definitely feels like it’s time to hug you.” It is clear what your motivations and intentions are, but still leaves the other person able to deflect if the attention is unwanted. The key is two way communication - always be honest with your intentions but ALWAYS be listening to verbal and nonverbal feedback. "
"Ahhh yeah.. look at this penny. I still remember the day I got it. Somewhen around 1991 I was going to a grocery store, just like this, and there was a beautiful woman, just like you, as a cashier. You kinda look like her. Was your mother a cashier, too? Eventually I know her. Anyways. Back to the story. So I was there, your mother (or whoever but I guess its your mother) stood there, and scanned my articles. Bread. Beans. Bottle o Jack. Toilet paper, but only the one with the 4 layers! 5 is a waste of paper, and 3 or less is scratching open my pimples on my ass. Oh, and I believe there was some thing else.. Hummm..... what was it? Let me think for a moment.... Oh yeah. Right. I also bought some floss.  
So as she scanned, I talked to her a little bit, and oh my. She is just like you. Are you sure your mother didnt work as a cashier?  


And well I only had some bills but it add up to a strange number.. 31.99 dollars I think. So I gave her two twenties, and she gave me the change.. I counted it up, and she forgot a penny. Well you might think now it was THIS penny here, but nu uh. I found it when I was walking home with my grocery bags in the hand... And I almost didnt pick it up! You would believe that! Let a penny lay on the earth! But I did, and I am so glad I did because now I can tell you the story about this coin.  


Ah, anyways. Youre holding me up, I am having tea with a very nice, elderly lady in 5 Minutes. I will be late, but I try to reduce it to only a few minutes.

"I tried to use apps, to no avail. Don’t have many friends who are active in the LGBT community to go for nights out/specific bisexual social events etc. I have no sense of ‘gaydar’ and everyone I find attractive tends to not be into girls as far as I’m aware. Currently in a relationship with a guy anyway. "
"My cousin just left his partner and their two kids to be with a woman half his age. My aunt is livid and refusing to talk to him, whilst still treating his partner like she’s part of the family. No one knows why he’s done it, but the new woman used to work with a coworker of mine (we’re not that close) so people keep trying to get me to probe for information.

In a slightly less dramatic note, at the same time my wife’s family just found out her kid sister has been smoking. They want us to speak to her (they think there’s more to it than that, and feel we’ll get a better response out of her for some reason, lol). However it’s kinda awkward as both me and my wife used to smoke (not that her parents know about it) and I feel so hypocritical talking to her about it."

"Also East Asian. I know the instinctual hackles-up feeling you’re talking about. I’ve also been through the experience of deciding to give someone the benefit of the doubt in good faith, only to be disappointed later. You walk away feeling used in a way no one else seems to understand. 

For the most part, I try to keep an eye out for red flags and vet people pretty well. I’m sure you’ve also come to recognize the warning signs and gut feelings. I also keep in touch with guy friends I’ve come to know and trust, so whenever I feel pessimistic about the dating world, I can look at them as reminders not everyone is like that. "
"I hear this a lot, that if kids aren't brought out in public they won't have a chance to practice good behavior...

I have a lot of kids. A LOT. I can (and do) teach them to behave in public by going to IHOP or Red Robin, there's no need to take them to an upscale restaurant for them to learn to clean up after themselves and treat wait staff correctly. There's even nicer restaurants if I want to take them one on one. I don't think letting some restaurants exclude kids will result in all, or even most, doing the same :)"
"I'm a celiac.

People always ask ""What happens if you eat gluten? Do you get sick?"" and while yeah, I'll get a little sick, that's not the problem.  The problem is the long-term abuse eating even a bite of gluten does to my small intestine.  It means I can't absorb nutrients, which, long-term, can lead to cancer, infertility, weight problems, depression, and other autoimmune diseases.

But just because people don't see me getting violently ill, they think it's absurd that, no, I can't just take the croutons off the salad, I need a new salad."
"Thank you! I'm so tired of these posts coming by constantly. Askmen doesn't have to put up with this. Daily there's some post asking women how we have been abused in the past, who was our worst partner, what's the worst thing that ever happened to us...reddit has a problem with reveling in womens' suffering. The front page more often than not has some kind of gif with a pretty woman or even a little girl getting into a painful accident. Sure there are lots of subs with guys getting hurt but the comments tend to be much less gendered. "
"As a man, here's what I got out of this thread:

1. Most of the women who responded like/prefer to be asked before certain small acts, far more than I initially thought.  

2. Even though most women prefer to be asked, it's still extremely important to read the flow of the situation and context clues. Don't want to pressure someone if they're not comfortable; ease into it. 

3. Theres nothing ""anti-romantic"" about stating your intent directly. It shows that you care, it makes women feel considered and desired, and goes a long way towards building respect. 

4. If you're going to ask, be confident about it. Confidence = sweet and considerate. No confidence = uncertain and inexperienced. "

So I only got honked at when I looked 15 and younger. "

"Florence + the Machine. I feel like I'm in some deranged, nightmarish fairy tale with her music. It's awesome."
I think they meant giving up their seat to someone in that situation
"It kind of kills me that you can say ""men have to cover too"" when they are considered covered with just shorts on. That's really minimal clothing. It isn't equivalent to the requirements women have to be considered ""covered."" It means a Muslim man can wear swim trunks on the beach, blend in with everyone else, be comfortable and not too hot, and still be considered modest. He can show off his chiselled abs, broad shoulders, and muscular back and still be considered modest. That sucks."
"Hahahaha, 23 years and they still barely acknowledge me. "
That sounds like the best solution to me.
I just creamed reading this
"I HATED pink as a kid cause my family shoehorned me into the ""tomboy"" role. I felt like I couldn't like it because I was boyish and pink was ""girly,"" something I was not. So I started hating pink because I ""wasn't like those preppy girls."" Refused to wear or own anything pink.

Now I'm 24 and my entire bed is dusty pink, my favorite shoes are pastel pink Converse, and I try to add dusty/pastel/rose gold pinks to every outfit. I fucking love it. All because I moved away from my family and the expectations they had placed on me."
"It’s very frustrating. I’m a black woman so I totally understand. I think sometimes certain men see me as something to check off of their bucket list. I get to know them, follow my intuition &amp; usually it’s not wrong. I don’t mind dating outside of my race, but when I feel like I’m just a black body part, it’s a turn off. "
I got my silk pillowcase for my hair but it ended up helping my skin so much more! I don't stay the night anywhere without it
I am pretty amazed at the fact that 20 cents made such a difference in your life. Congrats on the job! Way to persevere through some hard times. 
"She's always been deceitful, so it's no surprise that she cheated him out of the money. She once faked being pregnant so she could claim that she needed money for an abortion. She also once stole $800 from a church as a teen.

She hadn't been in trouble for 5+ years though, so we all figured that she finally got her act together, but it seems that she just got better at stealing. We probably won't see her again. She deleted all of her social media pages and isn't returning our phone calls. Once she blows through it, she'll probably try to contact us to apologize and give us some sob story about why she did it, but most of the family is done with her. "
"I think a lot of the time, culture and religion get mixed up, especially in Asia. Things like arranged/child marriages - they're strongly associated with Muslim countries like Pakistan, but actually, Islam forbids forced marriage completely, and unless there's a very good reason (eg concerns there'd be nobody to look after the teenager, she's an orphan) marriages aren't supposed to happen instantly just because the girl's crossed puberty. So this doesn't directly answer your question, but I think I'd change how Asian principles are often conflated with Islamic ones. 

A lot of the grievances people have with Islam stem, IMHO, from Muslims not behaving as they actually should. Nonmarital sex is 1000% as forbidden for men as women, but in some communities that doesn't seem to be applied, even though unmarried men are ordered to be as virginal as unmarried women. "
"Yeah, she’s never been on my list of things I’ll purchase. For all the racist shit.

Also I won’t buy Jeffree Star or Lime Crime."
My boss told me my work elevated the entire department and I’ve never forgotten that feeling.
"I was having a hard time in college because my advisor refused to help me schedule my classes, and I couldn’t get anyone to help me. I wanted to drop out since I didn’t think I could finish. I went to a local community college to ask about transferring there. The admissions advisor encouraged me to stay at my current college and even used her connections to arrange a new advisor for me at my current college. I ended up sticking with it and graduating with my bachelors degree. If it weren’t for that kind advisor who went above and beyond for a student she wasn’t even obligated to help, I wouldn’t have my degree today."
What a great girl. We should all look out for each other like that ❤️
"I know it sounds stupid, but give yourself a hug. These hugs are better than no hugs and help improve your mental state. It sounds like you need it! I kind of sandwich myself between 2 pillows if I'm feeling particularly lonely at bedtime. If you have A.C., drop the temp a few degrees at nighttime. You'll sleep better if it's cooler and then you can snuggle in your blankets and pillows to feel safe."
We all hate Times Square with a passion
