I made my own fandom and no one else acknowledged it. It was just me very sadly fangirling over the men of Top Gear. I can't even bring myself to Google my old Tumblr name so I can delete the blog. I'm too mortified.
"""What the fuck is wrong with you man"" is a great reply coming from another man."
Because there's a ton of men on Reddit and a lot of them want to know what women think of them. 
"The only quality my parents focused on was my intelligence. It was a lot of pressure. Bs were equivalent to Fs for them. I was always pushed to be the best and if I wasn’t then I wasn’t “living up to my potential.” So I just always felt like nothing I did was good enough. College was treated like an inevitability and I didn’t even know what to study so I wasted a lot of time and money. I became very depressed my freshman year and wanted to drop out. I actually got to a point I considered suicide rather than tell them. When I finally did admit how depressed I was, my mom asked “But what will I tell people?”  It was then I knew I wasn’t a real person to her - I was just a living reflection for her to show off. \

Edited to add: Wow all the responses to this are both heartening and heart breaking.  I'm glad we can relate to each other but it's just sad overall too.  "
That it doesn't matter how he's fed as long as he's fed. Constant crying and no sleeping means he's hungry. Not being able to breastfeed is not a failure- just a change of strategy. So get the damn formula so the baby won't suffer. Anyone who looks down on you for it isn't worth your time. 
"Whenever my mom suspected that I was lying, she told me to show her my tongue so she could tell if I was being honest. I'm embarrassed to admit that I was an adult before I realized that it was my refusal to stick out my tongue that actually revealed my deception.  "

"My first fandom was when I was about 10, and I discovered Fanfiction.net and RPF (it was still allowed back then, this was almost 20 years ago). I was super into boybands at the time, so I got excited and submitted some cringy stories about my Mary-Sue meeting the guys I liked and them all falling in love with her. Most of the other people in that section were fellow 10 year olds so they were appreciative, but one day I got my first bad review and oh boy, I did not handle it well. I was so hurt that someone dared insult my masterpiece (!) like this that I threw a big strop, posted an update that said I was NEVER COMING BACK!!! and deleted my account.

But the lure of writing and posting fic where a celebrity met me on the street and thought my Digimon t-shirt was totally cool was too much, and after a few days I remade a new account and began posting new fic, pretending to be someone else entirely. However there was just one problem: at this point in my young life I had not yet been taught that you're supposed to put a space after your commas and periods. All of my fic was written like this,in this pretty distinct grammatical style,and I had no clue I was giving myself away. Someone in the reviews pointed it out and called me out like, three days after I posted my new magnum opus. I was so embarrassed, and realised nobody would believe me if I denied it, so I sat down to think and came up with the perfect excuse: yes, it was me back again even though I'd said I was leaving forever, but you fools! It was all a test! Everything was by design, to see if you would notice! Congratulations, you have passed the test.

Even the other ten year olds were like ""/u/changhyun, shut up, you're talking crap. You're not the Riddler."" I slinked away in disgrace. Oof. Sometimes I remember this period in my life at night and kick the blankets in embarrassment.

"That you don't always feel like a mother, I expected to feel completely different but I just feel like normal me with a kid that I love.

"My parents were constantly talking about how *expensive* everything was. Anything we asked for, from birthday or Christmas gifts to school supplies or a happy meal turned into a huge deal because of how much it cost. (I grew up comfortably middle class so the vast majority of this stuff shouldn't have been nearly as big of a deal as it was.)

I still have a really, really hard time not freaking out anytime I have to spend money on anything I haven't specifically budgeted for, even when I can realistically afford it. "
"*a ton of young, single men.

I mean, what else do you expect from such a demographic. Sex/dating/intimacy is fundamental to the human condition and that includes Reddit's userbase. Since this userbase happens to be young (ie inexperienced) single and usually lonely men, they see a place called AskWomen and think ""oh hey, maybe it would help to get a female perspective on my dating issues"".

Sure it can get annoying, but it's not some nefarious attempt to dehumanize women. They're genuine questions and these guys are looking for a healthy outlet.

Or would you rather have them wander around until they find the more hateful anti-women ""advice"" subs instead?"

"my mom has always hated dogs and i never really questioned why. i knew she had a dog when she was little but i thought maybe it was mean or something and that’s why she didn’t like them. one day she told me her dad, who was a severe alcoholic and a complete asshole, came home drunk and mad and kept kicking the dog, and when he went to bed my mom laid on the floor with the dog while it died because she was too young to do anything. "
Unhealthy relationship with parents.
idk about attractive but I don't care about balding the way some people seem to. Some women and men go on about it like it's some alien lifeform on top of a guy's head. I can't stand the criticism Prince William gets. He seems like a really decent guy and we're going to reduce him down to something he likely can't help and maybe doesn't want to? Really?

"I've lived in The Netherlands (home country) Italy and South-Korea. All three have aspects that make them different. 


If I were to get into this topic very seriously, I could write a whole paragraph. Especially since dating/sex/love is a pretty wide scope. I will just touch upon some topics, but if you have questions, feel free to ask.


In the Netherlands, we split 50/50 on a first date. A woman might refuse to see you again if you make her uncomfortable insisting to pay for her, it would insult her. In Korea and Italy usually the man both wants and is expected to pay.

In the Netherlands, men and women aren't fierce flirters, we enjoy spending time casually together. You might be ""seeing each other"" for 3-4 months before you call yourself a couple. In Italy the dating game is far more aggressive, and forward. They are more jealous and hotblooded. In Korea, your status changes to dating like within a week, from the moment interest to get to know each other romantically is expressed.

Korea by far is the most intense dating scene. Society seems to be catered to couples. You download a couples-app to keep track of how many days you are together, with couples games. Shops sell matching underwear, matching coats, matching shoes. You can look like each other's twin. People post generic couple photos, in generic locations. It seems very scripted. In The Netherlands we'd find this so childish and extra.

"I have some real doozies.

Until I was about six, I thought that every TV show and advert was being recorded and streamed to the TV live. I felt so sorry for the actors in adverts that repeated a lot, because to me, it meant that they were stuck doing the same thing over and over again, all day every day. 

Around the same age, I read about puberty and thought it started and ended on your thirteenth birthday. I fully expected that, when I was about to turn thirteen, I'd go to sleep aged twelve and wake up aged thirteen with body hair, acne, a full set of breasts, and my period, while boys would wake up with acne, a deeper voice, body hair, facial hair, and the ability to get an erection.

I also thought that since Christmas fell in summertime for Australians, their months were reversed. I spent a while thinking, ""okay, so if it's May in the UK, what is it in Australia?"" and very nearly neomailed somebody on Neopets to ask ""what month is it over there?"""

"Hey I actually wrote workshops on this! Here are the 4 commonly recommended responses, based on the 5 D’s. FYI these tips are aimed at everyone, not just men, and aren’t just for sexual harassment!

DIRECT:
Say something like others are recommending, either to the harasser (‘hey, cut that shit out’) or to the person being harassed (‘hey do you want me to stand with you while you wait for your bus? I noticed that guy being a creepy to you.’)

DISTRACT
Recommended for situations in which you don’t know the harasser and you’re worried they’ll start a fight, eg drunk guys on the street. Don’t directly confront the harasser but say/do something to get his attention so he’ll forget about the woman, eg ‘Do you have the time?’ ‘Do you know where the bathroom is?’

DELEGATE:
Recommended for situations where you’re in an organised event or controlled space, and/or are concerned about your own safety if you got involved: Say something to a bouncer, the person who’s house it is, one of the harasser’s friends, whatever! (NB in a lot of bars in the uk at least if you ask at the bar for an ‘angel shot’ or for ‘angela’ then they’ll know you’re in a threatening situation and help you!)

DELAY:
For when you can’t actually intervene when it’s actually happening for whatever reason, or if it seems like it’s going to make the situation worse. This is stuff like if your drunk mate’s being a creepy to a girl, talk to him the next day when he’s sober about his behaviour. Then you’re deterring them from future harassment. Or if you see something happen, go up to the woman afterwards and just be like ‘that was shit, are you okay?’. Just to let her know that it’s not just her that realises it was not okay and she’s entitled to be upset, etc

The last D is something we recommend you keep in mind, no matter which of the four strategies you pick: DE-ESCALATE. It’s important that whatever you do, you consider whether it’s going to make things worse. This is important not just for your own safety (you don’t want beaten up!) but also because you don’t want to make things more stressful/traumatic for the person being harassed. Also, if you intervene and get hurt/anger the harasser, you might unintentionally discourage the harassed person from seeking help in future, because they’re worried doing so will endanger whomever they ask for help from.

ONE LAST TIP: if you see a woman on her own who’s clearly going home and in an unsafe situation, don’t offer to walk her home! That may be totally innocent on your part, but she doesn’t know you or know that and some predatory people use that as a strategy to assault people/similar. Instead, offer to walk her to the nearest shop/bus stop/taxi rank/public building!

Lastly, thanks not only for helping, but also making sure that you know how to actually help!

"When I was about 4 my mom's best friend divorced her crappy husband, Doug, and when I asked where Doug was, they told me ""Doug"" was a bad word (because they didn't wanna talk about him). I was appalled when the cartoon show Doug came out on Nickelodeon. How could they call it that?! In my kid-mind, they might as well have called the show ""Fuck""!! "
Big noses (I have an Italian nose and it’s not too big but it’s not too small either) that have character. I know some people think it’s ugly but small and perky noses are honestly getting boring and very common. I like unique features in people. It makes them stand out.

Simply telling the catcaller to leave the girl alone should be fine. Just don't expect anything in return from the girl and be on your way aftet and I'm sure she'd appreciate it 
"They never took me to the dentist. Apparently I went around age 7 and screamed such bloody murder out of fear that my mother never took me back. To this day she says, ""Well, you didnt want to go!!"" 

I'm paying for it still in my 30s -- literally and figuratively.  It's a huge source of embarrassment to me that my teeth are so bad. "

Not a crazy story, but still surprised me that it happened.

"I feel that I was more or less prepared for motherhood.  I'd done everything I wanted to do, traveled the world, made cool stuff, lived an exciting life.  By the time my daughter came around I was ready to shelve everything for a few years.  My partner is an amazing father, we're financially secure, my friends were starting to become mothers too.  I was fortunate to skip a lot of the negative responses posted in this thread because of all this.

What I wasn't prepared for is how much of my brainspace is now taken up by my daughter.  I used to think about politics, literature, my career as a nurse, my side business, all the time.  Now 80% or more of what runs through my head on a daily basis is her.  How she looked when I dropped her off at daycare.  Wondering if she went to sleep on time when I'm at work.  I replay the cute moments hundreds of times in my head while I'm passing meds or charting on my patients.  At times it almost feels intrusive."
"My maternal grandparents spent time in the camps.  They never told us whole stories about their experience there but they let out a snippet here and there.

The one I remember from my grandmother was when she visited me here in the US.  She couldn't sleep until she asked me to cover up the windows with a heavy blanket.  She said it reminded her of being tied down at nights with an open window above her.

For my grandfather, he had a picture of his two children from before the war.  He never told us their names or his first wife's name but in the last couple of years before he died, he told me the story of saying goodbye to them.  Knowing they were all headed to the camps but both he and his wife being brave for the sake of the kids and pretending everything was going to be ok.  He asked me to make sure their picture was buried with him so they'll never be parted again.

Edit based on a question I got: They were married soon after the war. The elders of the village they lived in basically set them up together as a way to help them heal. She needed someone to take care of her and he needed someone to take care of.  This was in Romania. When the communists came in they fled to Israel rather than risk another family. 

They had two daughters, five grandkids and both lived well into their 90’s. 

My grandfather would take us kids to the holocaust memorial in Israel and watch us play.  That was his way of showing the Germans they didn’t beat him. 

They were both wonderful people and great grandparents."
"They didn't say ""I love you"" much to me or my older sister, or even between themselves. A few years ago they made an effort to say it more and the first time it happened I sincerely thought one of them was deathly ill since it was so unusual. 

They also weren't big on physical affection or praise in general. It can be very hard for me to acknowledge when others do positive things, but I can focus with laser precision on negative things.

They aren't great at standing up for me or my sister either. One side of our family is just a bunch of old fashioned, spoiled assholes and it was always ""you should be the bigger person"" even when I was a literal child.

Edit: I'm so bummed that so many people relate to this. Group hug, y'all 🤗"

I had an uncle that would gain and lose weight frequently. My grandma told me that he would go to the doctor and they would deflate his tummy when it got too big. It was all fun and games until one time I saw him and I told him I thought it was time for him to be deflated.

"I'm honestly also not a big fan of these uber-perfect Instagram brows. You know the ones; perfectly slanted, gradient-like color, with exact borders and not a hair out of place?   
It *can* look great with like a full face of heavy makeup, at an occasion where that's appropriate... But most of the time I just think it looks too unnatural and overdone.

I'd venture that this is one of those trends, where in ten years or so we'll look back on it like we do on too-thin overplucked brows from the early 00s now. "
"How biological my body's response to her crying would be. I knew that babies cry and that the sound of it is horrible. What I didn't expect is that my breasts would literally physically hurt when she cried while I was nursing.  Now that I'm not nursing, the sound of her cry will still easily wake me, like I'll go from dreaming to 100% wide awake in a heartbeat. This doesn't happen for my husband, who I need to shake awake every time it's his turn to get up with her.

I also never knew that post partum hair loss is a thing, so when my hair started falling out at 4 months I freaked out."
"This is one of those things that really drive home the gender gap for me. 

One type of those ads on porn sites pretends there’s a specific person nearby looking to meet you, and it’s something like “Jenny, 300 feet from your house, wants to hook up.”

And if you replace Jenny with a dude, that’s not sexy or intriguing or exciting. That’s balls-out terrifying. That’s “I’m going to lock all the windows and turn off the lights and wait very calmly for the police to arrive.” It’s zero promise and all threat. And I kind of envy guys who can see that and not think, “I’m gonna get murdered tonight.”"
"My mother has never expressed sadness about her life, which is one of the strangest things for me to understand. As a child, she grew up dirt poor in Thailand with an alcoholic father who was never around, six siblings, and a mother who worked on her feet from dawn til dusk tending a coffee shop. My mom told me that my grandma used to come into her room at night to ask if she could sell my mom's jewelry for money. As the youngest of seven children, my mom was deemed the cutest and was often sent to beg the neighborhood butcher for scraps. She ate rice soup with stones in it to make it feel like there was something to chew on. One time, she laughingly told me about when she had a parasite that would emerge from her rear end at nighttime. But she has never expressed sadness about these events. Only gratitude. 

My mom is a strong woman. I don't know how she does it. I'm actually afraid to ask. 

OP, I hope your mom knows she has you forever. "
"I have a friggin' PhD in engineering, and this male coworker, who does not, offered to ""help me with the math"" in an article he suggested I read.

"I’m about to lighten this thread up. I struggle to remember to buy toilet paper. Growing up, and to this damn day, there’s a plethora of toilet paper in my parents house. 4 1/2 bathroom house, each cabinet never has less than 5 spare rolls of toilet paper. We have a weird decorative cabinet in the kitchen/hallway that has TONS OF TOILET PAPER in it. I swear I’d use one spare roll and later that day she’s already replaced it. Since my sophomore year of college, 8 years ago, when I got my first apartment, I always run out of toilet paper. It’s like my mind truly believes there’s a toilet paper fairy that will come restock my cabinets. My mom makes fun of me mercilessly for this of course hahaha. 

But she did buy me a stupid amazon toilet paper button. So now when I only have a roll or two left I can just hit the button to order 😂 it has kinda helped  But shes still the toilet paper fairy   "
"Or just ""don't be an asshole"". "

"It’s not a story about all the hardships of life, though my parents did have those, but it’s a story that’s always stuck with me. My dad has told it to me, and it’s a true story, backed up my grandparents and aunts and uncles who remember that day and the police talking to my dad.


When my Dad was 8, he was out in the street with some friends. About a block away, a preteen or teen girl was walking on the sidewalk when a car skidded off the road, way too fast, and hit a tree. The girl was in between the car and the tree and got pinned under the car. 


My dad and his friends heard the hit, then heard the girl screaming. They got over there in time to see the driver fleeing the scene. One boy went to a nearby house to call an ambulance. My dad and his friends tried to get her out from under the car but they quickly realized that her legs were shredded, and she was pinned down and that’s why she wasn’t bleeding too much. If they moved her, she’d rip open, bleed out and die. My dad also says that “most of her forehead and eyes were gone, too.” I don’t know what that means. 


She called out to then, she said she was scared and asked for her mom. My dad went under with her and held her hand. Another friend put his hand on her heart and prayed. My dad says she just kept asking for her mom and telling them to pray that her mom would get there. Then she stopped crying and screaming. Her eyes stayed open, open and still looking terrified. She died there, scared and crying and ripped to pieces, under the car with my dad and his friend holding her. 


She was a stranger. My dad was a child. My grandma says it really, really affected him and he had nightmares for a long time. He’s talked about it a few times, when it’s been relevant, and his eyes glass over and you know he can still see and feel her. He’s not an emotional guy, so it’s so rare to see him like that. It shakes me up inside. "
"the things that didn't happen. so many kids grow up with severe mental health issues, empty senses of identity, and they don't understand why they turned out so messed up because there was nothing ''wrong'' with their childhood. but the real answer lies in that there wasn't much RIGHT in their childhood, either.

i suffered abuse, but it would have been so much easier to cope with if i got any of this ''right'' stuff. things like your parents being physically affectionate, validating your feelings and thoughts, reading to you before you go to sleep, talking to you and giving advice. no one ever thinks to go to a shrink and say they're messed up because stuff of stuff that DIDN'T happen. they might not even know what exactly it is that they missed out on, let alone able to articulate it.

"I ask this because I had an experience recently where a good friend of mine fainted. Her boyfriend asked someone to grab a chair for him so he could put her legs on it and help blood rush to her head. I told him to not to do this as it could cause her more harm and put her in the recovery position. He replied that ""I shouldn't concern myself with the situation because he knew what he was doing"", implying that i didn't. He's a bartender, I'm a nurse. 

Nearly two weeks past and I'm still seething and wish I had said something back. So I'm interested in hearing other people's experiences. 

(Also please do not attempt to elevate someone  's legs if they faint, it could potentially cause more dizzeness and if they startle when they come around they could injure themselves)

"My parents gave me a bit of a complex about how I look. My mother did a lot of actually harmful, abusive stuff around weight and food and so on, and my dad put a stop to that right quick when he found out but he still impressed upon me the importance of looking proper at all times. He's never not in perfect shape, pristine shirts, shiny shoes, etc. so it wasn't an expectation he didn't live either but it's messed with me.

I only bought my first pair of track bottoms last year and wearing them around my husband was an ordeal not dissimilar to the colonoscopy I had a few years ago. He gets emotional about my hairy legs, imperfectly coiffed hair, ratty shirts, etc. now because it's taken me so long to let go of my need for physical perfection but on the plus side, I have an excellent husband."

My dad was away on business once and my mom and I went and looked at dogs at the shelter. We fell in love with a little terrier mix and named her Shelby. My dad had a history of abuse so it was no surprise when he was very upset when he came home and found a surprise dog. I took Shelby in my room while my parents were fighting and held her soooo tight. Shortly after my dad burst into my room grabbed her by the neck and strangled her in front of me. I was 7.
Honestly if I'm attracted to the person I'll find any feature on them attractive whether or not it's considered ugly

"When my mom was 4-5 yrs old (early 1950s) her mom saved nickels and dimes from coupons and sales from grocery shopping, and little bits of cash squirreled away for more than a year to buy her a swing set. One day, while her dad was out working as a truck driver, gone for days at a time, her mom brought home the swing set. Her older brother (20ish) put it together for her. 
After only a few days of playing on it, her father came home and was furious that this had happened without his permission and he tore it down, destroying it.  There was never another swing set for her.  We have a picture of her with her swing set. "
"I don't love to cook, but I offered to host Christmas dinner for my husbands family one year. Mostly because I had a toddler, two teenagers and was tired of traveling on the holiday instead of letting my kids play with their gifts and having to rush through the gift giving to make it to our destination on time. Halfway through the meal, my husbands stepmom commented on the food. She said she was surprised it was so tasty and did my husband do the majority of the cooking? No. He carved the fucking ham. That was it. I worked my ass off to make this elaborate meal only to have him get the credit. Hey lady...I said I don't LIKE to cook...not that I CAN'T. Big difference. I was really hurt because I tried numerous recipes in the weeks leading up to the holiday so everything would be just right. I was really proud of it, too. I made bacon rosemary mashed potatoes with garlic and red onion and a green bean casserole that used butter, cheese, garlic, and sour cream instead of mushroom soup. Homemade rolls. It was very time consuming. 13 years later and I'm still mad about it. I didn't respond, but when the gift giving began, I stayed in the kitchen to clean up.

"Absolutely yes, IME. My mom was such a great example of ""don't let perfect become the enemy of good enough."" With more than a kid or 2, it is impossible to make your own organic baby food, not have plastic toys, and the tons of other standards that moms are held to that make life harder, and judgier. We all had formula, had McDonald's as a last resort sometimes, probably too much TV, and yet.... We were always fed, dry, loved, and prioritized, and I'd say far better off for it"

"Compared with the answers I'm seeing...my worst experience really isn't bad at all!

I met up with a guy at a bar. It was like pulling teeth to talk with him. I try to talk about travel - ""I don't see why anyone would ever want to leave the US."" I try to talk about running. ""I don't know why people run for fun."" Finally he contributes something as says he likes cars. So I tell him about how my brother just purchased an Aston Martin ""Aston Martins are shit. I really only like Camaros."" I tell him I drove an old camaro for 9 years. ""You don't know shit about cars."" (I don't, not going to deny that...but really, all I said was that I drove a Camaro from age 16-25).

Then, to top in off, he starts talking about No Fap...and ho he tried that but it just made him angry, so he followed  strict ""Masturbate once every three days"" policy. He said it gave him sizeable loads without affecting his mood.

Check please. Separate, duh.

As we part ways, he tries to go in for a hand shake.

I jokingly ask if he masturbated today. He says yes. I ask if he washed his hands. He hesitates. I smile and say bye, leaving his hand hanging out there.

By the time I get home, he has deleted me from Tinder."
"Honestly straight up kudos to Prince William for not getting hair implants! It's not as if he doesn't have the money to do it. I appreciate him embracing a fact of life that a ton of men have to endure. 

I never really noticed bald dudes before I met my SO. I met him before he started losing his hair. I loved him then and I love him now, just the same. Also, him balding made me recognize other bald dudes and holy crap *so many men* go bald. It makes me really sad that it's typically a thing that's looked down on even though it's such a common thing to happen. "

"I do have some pet peeves, although really I have a larger annoyance with the messages that women are given about their looks.

Girls are encouraged to try to look older and not enjoy the skin they have.  When they become adults, they are then encouraged to chase their youth and that's never going to happen again.

Be what you want to be without following a carrot that you're never going to catch."

I wish more parents realised how much power they have over their kid's mental health once they reach adulthood. It doesn't even have to be a fully abusive relationship to truly make your child have issues. Even the smallest things like neglect and helicopter parenting affect you immensely. I'm still struggling with issues like anxiety and inferiority complex and I can't even blame my parents completely for the loser I've become because it's just so immensely hard to get out of these terrible mental habits that are second nature to me so I give up just as easily. 
"I was taught that debt was ok. Just pay for it later. 

I’m in finance for a living, so I should know better, but it’s been hard to learn to not spend. This year is the first year I’m on a budget...at 39 years old. It’s a big change, but I’m looking forward to saving and paying cash for an emergency. 

I have a teenager, he’s not aware of debt (to an extent), but starting this summer, I’m going to have him calculate the budget and hopefully set him up for a lifetime of financial success. 

Edit: BTW, I love my family and do t blame them at all. No one taught them any better. I just want to break the cycle. "
"There is no one story, but the older I get, the more it breaks my heart when I think of the thousand small slights my dad  dealt with.

Now, in the interest of full disclosure, on paper, both of my parents had easy lives.  Both sets of grandparents were moderately affluent, and nobody ever really did without.

However, I can't think of many people who's received less praise in life than my dad.

Growing up, my grandparents were the types who would nitpick every. single. thing. he. ever. did.  His shirt was too wrinkled.  His grades were too low.  His friends weren't the *right* kids.  He didn't fill the ice cube tray the right way.  He didn't chew his food enough times.  He's in his 60's now, and God help them, my grandparents will *still* scold him for holding his fork the wrong way or not tucking in his shirt.

He dropped out of college at 19, and started working at one of the large employers in town.  Over the next 42 years, he slowly climbed his way up to middle management, and though he never got rich, he was paid a fair wage for what he did. However, in that *entire* 42 years, he received less praise from his colleagues and upper management than I do in an average month.  It was the exact same dynamic as his parents/my grandparents: Nothing about him was ever quite good enough.

My mom left him because he wasn't quite good enough.  Quite a few of the girlfriends who followed did the same.

It's really heartbreaking whenever you tell him he's done a good job on something, because he just gets so excited, and you can tell that he hasn't heard that many times.

My mom, objectively, has had the harder life, but there's something about the banality of my dad's problems that almost make them *more* depressing. I don't know.  Somehow those things just eat away at a person more than the big things do, and unlike the big things, you can't really *talk* to other people about what it feels like to go 40 years without being told that you did a good job.   "
"I'm a 62F retiree who is happily single (divorced over 30 yrs) very independent and love living alone in my spacious (mortgage free) 2 bdrm condo.  

I have a close relationship with my 33 year old son and I've observed his wide array of friends and even though when I put my 'mom' hat on I might lean towards fretting and worry... I don't fear for this next generation.  

They are so aware and smart... and way more flexible and adaptable than I remember being in my 20s and 30s.  

I think all parents have that worrisome feeling of what kind of world they are leaving their kids in... but I also think with science and technology they'll always have a stone appear on the footpath forward.  

I've always thought I was so lucky to be born in the 50s and grow up in the 60s and 70s (they were fabulous!) but I'm sure my parents worried about the world they were leaving me in.  Sure I had my challenges, but overall I muddled through and am living a wonderful life.  

The rising strength of women and their voice in today's world leans me away from worry and more towards hope.  

Hope my POV adds to the convo.  :)"
"Agreed. It's best to call out the catcaller but then leave the woman alone afterward. I know Reddit has a thing for White Knights, but doing a good deed and expecting female attention afterward is pretty much the definition of a White Knight.

You might get a ""thank you"" for your actions, but don't be offended if she doesn't talk to you after. She will appreciate it."
"Hyper aware of peoples weight fluctuations, others and my own. 


My dad has struggled with his weight his whole life. And while he’s never called me fat, he always says things like “exercise now bc when you’re older it’s 10x harder to lose weight” and when he talks about people it’s usually the first thing he brings up. “So and so lost/gained a lot of weight”. 


I didn’t realize I did it too until a friend got exasperated with me one day and asked me why I focused so much on people’s weight.  


I still notice but now I’m aware and I keep it to myself. I don’t know how to uncondition it.

"I took my brother in law and his two small kids to lunch recently. My sister wasn't feeling well so I thought I could at least take them to lunch and hang out at a park for a bit to give her a short break. We ended up going to the nature museum instead, went to visit grandma and grandpa and before we knew it 9PM came along. I called my sister and she didn't pick up. We hung out for another hour and I took them home only to find my sister in the same spot we left her snoring loudly. She was so startled and a bit panicked for a minute.  
She called me the next day to thank me. She loves her kids and husband but she is never alone, when she leaves her kids with our parents she still has her husband. I'm planning to spend a weekend with my BIL and kids and then do the same with my sis the weekend after."

"I visited Korea for a few weeks and ended up dating a guy for most the time I was there. For reference, I'm from Canada and have never been one to make a 'show' of my relationships. It was very... intense. He started saying ""I love you"" very quickly, we had matching shirts and bracelets (!!), we took lots of selcas making matching expressions/poses, and he was very like, idk, cutesy in the way he'd act/speak to me. The thing that stands out the most was when he asked me to ride a two person bike with him. In hindsight it is a cute date idea, there were lots of couples there doing it, but it was just so far from my experience I didn't even know what to do. Bikes aren't super common/practical in my province and I haven't ridden one in about 10 years, and honestly the thought of sharing a bike with another person is just... weird. He was really taken aback that I wasn't into it, because that's apparently just one of the things Korean couples do, I guess.


This got long winded, but yes. Koreans do get VERY extra about love."
"A lot of people in comments are saying “just fuck some rando for free”. But the question isn’t SHOULD her cousin buy an escort, it’s what is an escort like? So we’re kind of off topic in this thread (and yes I know I’m not helping by posting either, but I wanted to give a pro-escort argument)

For those commenters who are anti the escort idea: People are saying fuck a dude who’s into it (a rando from the bar) but I think the point of getting an escort is knowing that your pleasure is the focus, which you’re most likely not going to get from a random hookup. It may also be lower stress in hiring an escort and knowing that you can stop the sexual interaction at any time without fear of being judged or harmed by the stranger you’re hooking up with. Obviously I would never say that someone should break the law if it’s not legal to engage an escort in your country but I see the merits of the idea. "
"I’m 38, and I am far more optimistic about the future generations of women than worried. But things like decreaing access to healthcare and reproductive rights are always concerning. "

"This happened to me too!! One time they made a pretty large purchase for me, and subsequently switched to off-brand groceries for a few weeks, pointing out how much of a financial struggle it was every time they rationed out a small glass of OJ. At the time (12 years old), I was filled with guilt over how I had financially devastated the family with my needs. Now as an adult, I know how much money they had at the time, and that the dramatics were just to try to teach me the value of money... but I still agonize over even the smallest of purchases. "
Not so much makeup but - long pointy false nails. They seem to impractical and gross. 
"I try to look at my body as a whole. Sure, my thighs might be big, but with the rest of my body they look quite decent. Other people don’t see all the details like we do. They don’t just see “fat thighs” or “soft stomach”, they see a whole living, capable body

Another thing that has helped me has been what my body can do - I can work for whole days at the shelter now, which is amazing! At one point i could hardly go for a walk without needing to sit down, now I’m on my feet for 9 damn hours and it feels GOOD. And those thighs make that possible, damnit. So i gotta accept them and care for them, cuz they make living life a possibility "
"That they grow up *so fucking fast.* People say this shit all the time, but you never actually realize the significance of it until you look down and your twin micro-premies are almost 2 years old, and their baby sister is coming up on 6 months. Where the *fuck* did those years go? 

And it's only gonna get worse. Soon they'll be up to my chest, then maybe as tall as I am- *fuck.*

Also that low-key alcohol dependency is a *big* thing with moms. At least, y'know... me and the sorts of moms I sometimes interact with. We be drahnking. Something to watch out for.

Also that there is no safe age from predation. Just a couple months ago I had to track down some old fuck at a chili festival that I caught taking sneaky, rushed pictures of my twins. Cornered him and had him delete that shit. "

"My parents immigrated to Canada from south east Asia with three young kids and about $100 in their pocket having lost everything they had due to war. With a language barrier and no marketable skills, they took low paying jobs just to get by.

My dad had found a job working in the kitchen of donut shop. He was promised something like $4 per hour but when his first paycheck came, he found out they had cheated him so he quit on the spot. He spend the next days going around the city looking for another job. 

One day, my mother was on her way home from her seamstress job and bumped into him on the city bus. He was crying because he couldn’t find a job. Thinking of my strong, stoic dad publicly crying out of desperation will always get me. "

"I also feel like if you look at it from the wrong direction it suddenly looks a lot more fake.    
Like, from straight on or a 3/4 view it looks great and works like it's supposed to (""shaping"" the face because you see the contour makeup as light and shadow), but if you look at it from the side, or the real light hits them in a way that the contouring doesn't make sense anymore, suddenly you only see dark makeup."

"I was working from home one day and I emailed IT support because I wasn’t getting any emails into a busy joint inbox I was rota’ed to cover that day. I included a clear list of steps I had taken including trying both Remote Desktop and webmail on my laptop and on my iPhone using both WiFi and 3G. My internet connection was working fine otherwise including my own individual inbox, so I was positive it wasn’t an internet connectivity issue at my end. 

Someone from the IT helpdesk phoned me and said that if I was having trouble with the strength of my WiFi signal I should try sitting in a different room in my house. I was so speechless I just let him end the call! I had been REALLY clear that my WiFi wasn’t the issue damn it! 

The next day, our IT manager came round to tell everyone they had a complaint in with Microsoft because of emails not being received. Why yes, I was pretty smug now you ask..."

"Growing up it was just me and my mother. We had a few chickens, and about an acre of yard. We lived in a semi-rural area. One of the neighbors would let his large dogs off leash on their walks and they killed a few of our chickens. My mother told me if I ever saw them outside and the owner wasn’t right there, to grab a leash and tie them up. We had two dogs ourselves so we had leashes on hand. She said she would call animal control and press charges. I was 8, I believed her. 

Well a short time later I saw the dogs loose and no owners. I leashed both dogs and proudly showed my mother. She tied them to a clothes line between two trees in the back yard, and came out with a shot gun and shot the first dog. I ran to the other dog and hugged it. She told me to move or she would shoot me too. I ran inside and took my own dogs with me to the bathroom and cried. She then came and got me and made  me help her put the dead dogs in large black trash bags and we dumped them somewhere. I don’t know where. This was 20 years ago and I can’t write this without crying. I can hear the crying of the second dog after he saw what happened to the first one. I can feel his shaking. And I can remember how I cried helping hold the trash bags. I can feel there fur, they were fluffy like German shepherds and soft. 

A few days later I was outside playing on my bike and the dogs owners walked by. I was terrified. I started crying and saying sorry and they just said they knew it wasn’t my fault and gave me a hug and kept walking. 

I ended up being removed from her custody a year later. Thank god, because I honestly believe I wouldn’t have survived. "

"I had a guy come over and he was attractive so we had sex and then went to sleep. I had to work at 1:30 PM the next day. I had to wake this kid up at noon and be like okay bro I have to get ready for work, you need to leave. 

My room was absolutely spotless at the time. So he started to get dressed and couldn't find one sock. HE ACCUSED ME OF STEALING IT. I was like what in the fuck would I want with your crusty sock. He searched through all my drawers and dumped out my dirty clothes hamper looking for it. I ended up finding it weeks later in my sock drawer. I kind of think he planted it there, but I'm not sure why. 

So he finally starts to leave and HIS CAR GOT TOWED because he parked exactly where I told him not to. Looking back now I would've told him tough shit, got him an uber and went to work. But I took him to the car tow place so he could get it back. And of courseeeeeee he doesn't have his wallet. So I had to pay for it, and sign for it because he doesn't have an ID on him. BUT the car tow place DOESN'T TAKE FUCKING CARDS so we had to go find an ATM to get cash. 

So he finally gets his car, I'm already like 30 minutes late to work, and he goes ""okay I'll call you later"" and I just said ""never talk to me again."" 

He texted a few hours later and said he lost the fucking stylus for his phone. I blocked his number. "

The surgeon called me ""a terrible bitch nurse"" because I called them at 3am instead of waiting until the morning to tell them about their patient trying to die.

Turns out the surgeon used the wrong suture material and it tore, causing some massive bleeding. But he still tried to get me written up for insubordination or some other nonsense."

"Also just a little guide in case people are unsure what to do if they see someone faint.

Often people will regain consciousness before you have time to reposition them, but if they don't place them in the recovery position and if possible place something soft such as a pillow or folded up coat under their head. 

Explain the what's happened when they come around 

Don't rush them to sit/stand let them do it in their own time when they feel ready. 

If there is a crowd move them away. 

If possible give them a sugary drink. If they are too hot try open windows or take them somewhere cooler when they feel comfortable standing. 

If you feel you are about to faint or someone tells you that they feel faint. Sit down immediately. Even if it's on a floor, better being dirty than cracking your head from a height. Again follow all the stops above :)

Hope this doesn't come across patronising or overly obvious b

"Email conversation with a marketing contractor that worked, among other things, on our website:

Me: Hi, I noticed you deleted the backups of a page I updated. Please don't do that anymore. 
Her: All the backups are cluttering the interface, I cleaned it up.  
Me: There's a tool to filter them out, please use it. We may need those backups one day, don't delete them.   
Her: *Well, I'm sorry if you're not confident enough to work without a backup but that's not my problem.*

"I guess you could say I have daddy issues. Parents were 18 and 14 when I was born (I know, statutory rape) and my dad (14) didn’t know I existed until I was 1. My mom dropped me off at my dads moms (my nana) when I was 3 and never came back. Nana moved me out of the state and I saw my dad once a year. He married, had 3 kids, and was addicted to a wide array of illegal substances. 
My nana was abusive. She knocked out my front tooth when I was 11, she’d often tell me I was a slut (developed early) or worthless, she once assaulted me and my neighbors called the cops. They wanted to charge her with attempted murder because she sat on me (big lady, I was 17 and 100lbs) and put a pillow over my face and kept asking if I could breathe, if I was going to pass out, etc.,. She told me it was no wonder my own parents didn’t love me, things like that. 
After I moved out (right after I refused to press charges... because faaaamily), I got into a really abusive relationship. Fractured jaw, constantly wearing scarves to hide bruises, literal fear for my life. 
Plenty of other reasons but who wants to read my book? Lol. 
I have never completely trusted anyone besides my husband. I met him at 18 and he’s been my rock. That’s cheesy, but true. He keeps me sane. I never thought I’d get married because before him, relationships were just stress. Worrying what he’s doing, who he’s talking to, when he’ll decide I’m worthless and beat the shit out of me. But with my husband, I am calm. He brings me peace and I could never put into words how thankful I am. "

What, specifically do 'poor people' do to not pay taxes?"" they look at me like it's just a known thing and that I'm unreasonable for asking. Yeah, no - unless you also do this for a living, I would bet dollars-to-doughnuts that I know more about current tax law and all related topics.

It's always the people who are one-upping me to make some obscure political point about corporations, rich people, poor people, having children, running a business, but cannot describe anything specific beyond blips and soundbytes, that are the most aggravating and patronizing"
"My mom was pretty obsessed with image and started getting concerned about my weight when I was 12ish. I wasn't fat, I was 116 lbs and 5'6 at the time \(and still growing, I'm 6'1 today\).

Anyway, her way of making me concerned about weight and food was expressed in her fear of me getting diabetes. Throw some already existing hypchondria in, a small bladder and you end up with a girl so scared of diabetes that she would often spring by the local doctors in the morning before school to check her blood sugar. I don't have diabetes. 

Another thing her concern with image was that she started styling and putting make up on me when my first zit came. That behavior resulted in me being getting so insecure with how I looked that I was covered in make up, not letting anyone \- even family \- see me with a bare face from the ages 13 to 20. I slept with make up on. That one was a hard one to drop. Took about a decade and I'm not finished with it yet. I can go to my local grocery without makeup, but any further than that... No way. "

"An escort will put your pleasure first. Make you cum. Make you feel super comfortable.

How I’d finally have a use for all those tiny Tupperware tubs. 
"First I would suggest finding your *true* size. Go to r/abrathatfits to start. 

If you’re in mainstream sizes I suggest aerie for comfy cute reasonably priced bras. I’m one of those lucky folks (30DDD that sisters to a 32DD) but even my size is hard to find. 

If not I would go with panache or freya but buy them through amazon so you can return them if they don’t fit properly. 

Either way your true size is very important to finding good bras and the best bra for you! "
I had to change pediatricians 3 times when my daughter was born. I didn’t have enough supply and they couldn’t fathom that I had put her on formula. One even told me he couldn’t believe I would willingly cheat my daughter out of many advantages in life by not breastfeeding. I felt awful and anxious for months. My 2 year old is happy healthy and incredible. 
The trend I hate most is hating on what other people put on their face.

"Ugh, I hate that. I work for an optometrist and it’s so annoying when parents baby their kids and don’t lead by a good example and tell their kids it’s for their own benefit. They’re doing them a disservice in the long run.

Sorry, no offense to your mom, it’s just something that bugs me on a daily basis. "

"Oh my god, one I can answer! 

My parents were born in post-war Korea. The Korean War ended 1953, my Dad was born in 1957, into a family of 6 kids. 

They grew up in rural Korea, doing some sustinance farming and running a corner store. 

My Dad likes to reminisce about his childhood - I remember this ONE story, of how excited he would get for the yearly school trip, where they'd go into the scenic Kumgang mountains, and picnic. My Dad was SUPER excited because his Mum would pack something extra special into his lunch - a SINGLE, HARDBOILED EGG. 

Let me repeat: A SINGLE, HARDBOILED EGG. 

He'd look forward to this egg, ALL YEAR.

"So, my brothers (14yo and 12yo) spend the night at my house. They are cursing, saying the n word and all sorts of disrespectful behavior. I get on them about it, but it doesn’t stop. Finally, I take them home and tell my dad about all that had happened. He responded with, “well, Angie (a woman he has known for 2 months) says they are good, sweet boys.” 

I was infuriated. So, you’re going to take the word of a woman that you’re sleeping with and known for 2 months over your daughter that you’ve known for 25 years? Are you flipping kidding me? This is not the first time he’s done this, but each time it’s an absolute slap in the face. "
"My dad was really into magic as a hobby and loved showing me new magic tricks. When I was younger, he showed me 2 limes and magically ended up with 3, from there on out, I believed we didn't have to go grocery shopping anymore."

"Start by cleaning my house. It doesn’t fix everything, but it’s distracting and therapeutic and it makes me feel like I have a handle on at least one aspect of my life. Similarly, self care. Take a shower, if it’s morning, do nice hair and makeup and wear a more out together outfit, or if it’s evening do a mask or something extra for your skincare."
"My mom was adopted and raised on a rabbit farm by her (abusive) parents. 

She had a pet rabbit she was allowed to care for. Until one day they had rabbit for dinner. It was her pet rabbit and they didn't tell her until she had already eaten it. "
"(dude here)

I've struggled with this too. It felt as though my parents loved the *idea* of me instead of the actual person I was or wanted to become. Like you, they pushed intelligence like mad. Were your parents also very controlling about which interests/hobbies you were allowed or not allowed to have? I was always interested in tech but that was actively discouraged and prohibited because that didn't fit their mold for who they wanted me to be. 

Anyway, when college came around they forced me to apply to schools I didn't want to go to. I thankfully got a full ride from my State University and wanted to go there, but they said no. No child of theirs would go to only a state school. So I got shipped off to the east coast to the best school I got into, sight unseen and fit be damned. 

I ended up incredibly depressed with suicidal ideation. It came to a head during christmas break of my sophomore year. I told them that I was taking control of my life and transferring to the state university. They screamed. They yelled. They said they'd cut off all financial support and I wouldn't be welcome in their home anymore. That's fine. I'd rather make my own path alone than continue this. 

It ended quite well. I went to the state university; they didn't cut off contact or cut me out of their lives. I stopped being depressed once I felt like I was in control of my life choices. They've slowly come around to how controlling they were and have apologized. I love my parents but still carry the baggage of dislike for that whole ordeal and my childhood. 

Did everything end up okay for you? If you're in the thick of it I want you to know that it gets better. "

"I thought similarly about Tv/movies. When there was a flashback, showing a character at a younger age, I was amazed at how prepared/patient the director was to of recorded the star when they were younger... lol"
How lonely I would feel.
"How fast it goes, and how the memories become a blur. My older kids are teens now. And while I would not want to go back, sometimes it was easier to change a nappy or give a bottle than it is now to talk about healthy sexuality and consent, dealing with my kids friend-group drama, keeping them safe from online weirdos in this IG/FB life. "
A parent's primary role should be to ensure their child doesn't have a childhood they need to recover from. (not my words but it speaks true for me!)

"""We welcome inquiries from everyone into the *mysteries of the feminine.*""

Ugh, what? Does it really say that? Pfft. That needs to be changed to: ""We welcome inquiries from everyone- so that you, too can hopefully realize that women are simply human beings, are varying individuals, are not actually that mysterious, and are not in fact some kind of monolithic alien species.""

"Oh gather around, children, because this old crone of fandom is going to tell you stories of epic cringe.

1991 - My first written fanfiction, a gigantic Mary Sue *Star Trek The Next Generation* epic with a 14-year-old supersmart multi-racial (as in Vulcan, Orion, Romulan, human, something else I bet) girl-with-an-adult-job who turned down Wesley Crusher, befriended Data and Geordi, and sacrificed herself for the good of the Enterprise.  Unsurprisingly, *I* was 14 and thought I was super-smart.

First half of the 1990s - Still writing *Star Trek* fanfiction, but I discovered 'zines.  I wrote a regular column for a monthly newsletter 'zine reviewing episodes of *Sliders*, *Babylon 5*, *VR.5*, and *Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman*. I also wrote reviews in *Quantum Leap* zines.  *Babylon 5* was my main adoration, but the cringiest?

*Star Trek* poetry.  Oh yeah.

The second half of 1990s - *Babylon 5*, *X-Files*, and *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. Discovered Usenet and archives and mailing lists and oh my god, you kids have no idea how hard it was to find mature fanfiction online, especially slash.  For the main *Babylon 5* one, you had to know someone who could then recommend you, and then you'd get in and then it was a whole new world.

Cringiest this time? Honestly, most of it, which is pretty much all still online, but I think the fact that I did two college research projects on slash fanfiction on the Internet pretty much takes the cake. It was the perfect storm of cultural study pretentiousness mixed with my own personal shipping biases.

The first half of 2000s - Livejournal was a beautiful disaster filled with the wide range of cringe. *Harry Potter* was ridiculous, but surprisingly tame in the femslash side of things.  I was still buried in *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, but the sheer amount of flamewars and wankery seemed to slow down.

However, I think that my full-blown Britney Spears obsession and dabbling in NSync wins.

The second half of 2000s - *Doctor Who*.  My husband was into *Doctor Who* when he was a kid and a teenager and he warned me that the fandom was an abyss of misery, but then you add the drama of teenage girls... Oh good god.

2010, my last real going nuts into fandom.  *The Losers*.  A second-rate comic-book movie with a hell of a lot of actors who are big names now but were touch-and-go back then. I fell *hard* and would not shut up about them.

Since then I crash landed into *Star Wars*, and fell in love with *The Legend of Korra* but I haven't written in ages.  It's a mix of too much writing in my day job and just generally not feeling it.  I'm on Tumblr, but it's mostly reblogging lovely fanart, ridiculous memes, and not getting involved in discussion.

So instead, my cringiness is the large and beautiful *The Legend of Korra* tattoo I have on my upper left arm.  I'm the Avatar, and you have to deal with it!"

"Yeah.
Same happens on AskMen, it's just that there are fewer women who go there and fewer women on Reddit in general.

"Just the other day, a family friend started up the good old ""iPhone vs. Android"" pissing contest. I'm frankly fucking tired of this debate and people making me feel like I have to justify my goddamn preferences, *and* I had been listening to him make stupid pretentious remarks like ""This IPA has hints of caramelization in it"" and ""I only put salt on my beef because I'm a *purist*"" as well as interrupt me literally every two minutes (he's the type of person who will argue with you even if you're agreeing with him because he wants to show you how much more HE knows than you) so I told him straight up that I didn't give a fuck and I didn't ask for his opinion.

He said, ""Oh, look, someone's triggered!""

And I said, ""I'm not triggered, and that's not how that word is used.""

And he said, ""So how is it used?""

And I said, ""It's often used for people who have PTSD. I'm annoyed, I don't have PTSD.""

And he laughed at me and said ""I think you do have PTSD"" and told me ""some people have no self-awareness"" (how FUCKING IRONIC).

"My husband also for some reason gets ads to become a catholic priest. Even though we are episcopalian....and he is obviously married which is kind of a nonstarter for catholic priests.

"I never would have thought about this, but this is absolutely correct. 

My first thought imagining an ad like that, with an attractive man, was ""Ted Bundy"" is attractive too. "
"They put so much stock into my success in school that they did my projects for me from elementary school til I finally learned to put my foot down around 7th grade.  Their hearts were in the right place - I was in a ""gifted and talented"" program (cue eye roll) and they thought the amount of work I got was excessive, but apparently it wasn't an option to let me stumble along, learn time management, and maybe even (gasp) fail every now and then.  It essentially taught me that I wasn't capable on my own and that good grades were more important than learning any kind of life skills.  I'm now 32 and still cannot handle making mistakes."
"I'm originally from Zimbabwe but I grew up in Ireland and I am currently living in the Netherlands.

In Zimbabwe, dating is still very traditional. The man is typically the one who pursues and woo's the woman. On dates, he is expected to pay for the entire, if not most of the, bill. Titles/labels are very important so it is rare for people to be dating for a long time before they call it a relationship. Depending on your age, marriage tends to be the expected outcome, again with the man being the one to instigate the proceedings. Family tend to get heavily involved in the relationship with regard to the engagement and married process.

In Ireland: I didn't have a love life in Ireland as I moved away from there when I was a teen (before I was even allowed to date anyways). But from what I saw from my friends, things are still traditional to an extent. Irish people still hold marriage to a great value. But I'm not experienced enough in the dating scene to have much of an informed opinion.

In the Netherlands - they are not so traditional. Casual dating can occur for months before a title is given. Men and women pay for themselves on dates (some women might even get offended if the man offers to pay actually - which I personally don't get. I am somewhat traditional so I don't mind if a man offers to pay for the date. It's a kind gesture and I can always pay for the next one). Also, Dutch people tend to focus on dating people within their ecosystem - it's very rare for couples to have met from outside their circle, neighbourhood or hobby, and school etc. Marriage isn't really valued as much though that is not to say that marriage is no longer a thing. The way Dutch people woo each other is very casual and romantic gestures are rarely as overt as other countries. 

EDIT: I forgot to talk about sex.
Sex in Zimbabwe is still seen as a marriage-only thing. Though couples still do it, it is not as openly talked about and tends to be a secret.
In Ireland and the Netherlands, they are more open about their sexualities and so sex is not a taboo topic for the most part."
It's ok. I told my boyfriend that Hammond is on my list. I'm only 25 so he's definitely old enough to be my dad. I would have fangirled with you. 
"I'm going to go against the grain of the replies so far and say that it affected my life *a lot*. Everything from jobs/social life/school/mental health was severely negatively impacted by my fat. Mainly in terms of confidence. Didn't feel like I could wear cute or revealing clothes, because they honestly did not look good at all. Got sweaty often and easily. Little to no *quality* interest from the opposite sex. Chub rub is horrible, as is the excess hair growth that often comes with being an overweight woman. I basically just felt uncomfortable in my own body, all the time. My thoughts were consumed with how chubby I was, what I was or wasn't eating, how to lose weight. I put off doing a lot of things ""until I lost the weight"" and there was a lot of things I wouldn't allow myself or felt like I didn't deserve because of my weight. I peaked at 5' 150 lbs, so I was never even huge. I have since lost 40 lbs and the difference is incredible. My life is 1000 times better in every aspect. Not just the way I look, but my self esteem/mental health, job prospects, social life, the way I carry myself and so on. All of that is vastly different. Honestly, getting healthy is without a doubt the best thing I've done for myself in my life so far. 

I think the answers you will get from currently obese women and/or women who have always been heavy will be quite different from those of us who have been on both sides of the equation. I think people who've never experienced being a healthy weight may not even realize how much different and better it is. "
"Omg. I had 3 girls first, and then a boy. He's almost 3 and *obsessed* with his penis. I can't tell you how many times a day I have to tell him to either stop touching his penis in the living room, not to put his penis on people, or to put it back in his damn underwear."
"I wish I'd understood that I may not feel an instant connection, and that is okay.  With my first, he was just this weird thing that cried constantly.  It took a while to find that bond.  Of course it did happen, and he's now an amazing 12 year old that I adore more than I can express.  But when he was first put into my arms, I felt nothing except exhaustion."
I will not be on my $@&amp;% period on my birthday.
"Went back to his place, presumably for sex, and the pillowcases were stained with blood. Place was filled with empty beer cans. Four, I kid you not, four rusty, hair-filled razors in the shower (all were his - he lived alone.) The sink was coated in hair and toothpaste. I was so disturbed. Then he told me he had a suspended license and a kid he never met, and I high-tailed it home."
"My parents totally fucked me up when it came to dating. They constantly made a big deal out of everything and generally treated dating as this huge thing. I couldn't even have a friendly conversation with a girl without them making fun of and embarrassing me (""Ooooooh is that your *giiiiirlfriend*?!""). They would just call it friendly ribbing, but as a young teenager tentatively discovering my interest in the opposite sex, it was traumatizing. 

When I got a little older it changed from making fun of me for even talking to girls to making fun of me for *not* having a girlfriend. They were constantly pushing me to ask out every girl we came across and asking if I was gay or something (in a 'joking' way). 

It wasn't until late in college after I'd been out of their house for years that I was able to un-fuck myself when it came to dating. And they wonder why I never talk to them about my personal life... "
"I wouldn't go in the pool alone because I was afraid of invisible sharks.

"I focus on one thing at a time, when that is done I move on to the next. I find if I try and do too many things, all at the same time, I get so overwhelmed and everything seems kind of hopeless. 
Write a list of things you want to do but be specific, for example instead of just writing do the washing write wash the clothes, hang clothes to dry/put in tumble drier, put clothes away. The more ticks that appear on my list the more motivated I feel tackle the next chore or problem. "

"I got ripped apart on this site once for stating that Italian men are jealous. But I really did notice it in my relationship and others much more so than the US, and most of my Italian friends agreed. One explained it to me as ""showing that you care about them"".

My bf was over the top though! He called me one morning and demanded to know if I knew a guy named Marco. I was like uhh I know like 20 guys named Marco why? Apparently he had dreamt that I got into a car with a guy named Marco and started grilling me asking me questions. I was like dude that was a dream I didn't actually do that?!

He wanted me to text him CONSTANTLY too. I was in liceo (high school) and the teachers were really strict about texting. So when I finally had a break I would have like 15 texts from him, asking if I was on break yet, then getting mad.

It was so infuriating and I was constantly explaining myself to him for no reason. I've never experienced something like it since. Of course I think he was an extreme case!

He was also REALLY against any type of oral sex and found it disgusting."

Again, I don't regret it at all. Just an embarrassing and kooky time of my life lol."

I think currently it works really well for both of us because I don't have to deal with the day to day grind of work, and we both get to spend evenings and weekends relaxing and having fun together instead of doing chores. 

Having such a significant division of labour in our relationship does mean that we to have to be mindful about appreciating what each of us contributes."

The friend held her down while the brother did the deed, then they switched places. I was horrified. There were many other, more detailed stories, but this is the one that always stood out to me (and one other, but this one is horrific enough that I don’t think anyone wants to hear the other one).  As much as I hate my mother, I still feel so horribly for her and the things she went through. "

"Oh man, this gives me flashbacks. When I was around 13-14, I started writing Jonas Brothers' fanfiction. As time progressed and I became more curious, I wanted to post ""more grown up"" (HAHA) fics, so I created a new blog and invented this person behind it: Selene. I was so scared of my friends finding out I wrote sex stuff, but I also wanted them to read it. So Selene got a MSN Messenger account and added my friends under the pretense that she was my friend. ""She"" got them to read the stories and actually befriended them. Soon enough everyone realized, because I would go offline when Selene came on. That was so embarrassing."

"When I was a kid my mom would tease me for learning new skills.  I remember being 10 or 11 and learning how to defragment the computer, and I was pretty excited.  She said ""You think you're a software engineer don't you?""  In retrospect she just thought it was cute that a little kid was interested in such a thing, but I took it as ""You knowing things about computers is wrong and by doing it you're trying to be something you're not.""

Same thing with cooking.  ""Oh you think you're a five star chef.""  Same thing with writing.  ""Oh you think you're a novelist.""

I know she didn't mean to, but it has made it hard for me to express pleasure while learning things, or to be confident in learning new skills.  I still feel embarrassed when I'm trying something new."

"Not sure if this 100% fits but I had a new CEO come visit me from HQ (in another country) when I was country manager of an office in Europe for a company with a large global footprint.  He took me to lunch which ended up being just a massive series of red flags.

He talked about my future and said something like “the sky is the limit, except with obvious limitations.” When I asked him what he meant, he said “well, obviously we wouldn’t put a Christian *woman* like yourself in Pakistan.”  

First of all, I was an atheist working for a completely non-religious organization - I have no idea where he got that descriptor from. 

Secondly, and perhaps most egregiously, our *successful* Country Manager for Pakistan at the time was, in fact, a practicing, actively Christan WOMAN and a good friend of mine.

It was such a crazy exchange and I was left speechless.  I started putting my CV out as soon as I got home from that lunch.  Sure enough, this idiot CEO managed to tank the (250 year old) company in record time."

The point where I had to say ""Girl, no"" was actually towards a male client, not a female. I received my Masters degree young, so I just turned 25 and a lot of clients started to treat me more like a peer than a therapist. The biggest brake I had to put on it is when a male client was aggressively flirting with me. To the point, where I had to bring in my clinical supervisor to sit on sessions. One session I conducted we were talking about coping mechanisms and he was like, ""Hmm... I don't know. Thinking about you helps"" like my clinical supervisor wasn't even there. I had strongly emphasize that he had two options: End the comments or terminate the session. He later on apologized for his behavior."
"I still hate myself, I just care less if other people hate me."

"my mom always says something like this: days are long, but years are fast."
I honestly believed that was a ticketed offense until I was like 25 because of my parents take feeding me that lie. I was shocked to find out it's not.

"I believed my brother was innocent.  


One day, a giant ""7"" appeared scrawled on the wall of our family home. It was drawn with crayon. My brother denied fault, despite the following evidence:

* The day the 7 appeared happened to be his 7th birthday.

* The 7 was scrawled directly over his bed.


* No other potential suspect had motive to write the 7.


* All other potential suspects had notably superior handwriting.


I now see that he was likely guilty of this offense, although 31 years later, he still maintains his innocence."

"For me it was how much i lost by becoming a mother. I no longer was able to play sport, pregnancy and complications caused massive health issues I'm dealing with years later. How i lost most of my friends, many due to my depression. The biggest thing was losing my sense of self, my idea of who I was. It's taken me quite a while to find me again. "
"The guy I had a crush on for MONTHS just became my boyfriend as of three days ago... It turns out he had a crush on me for months too! 

We both didn't want to potentially make the other uncomfortable so we never made a move. But we went on a date and pretty much haven't stopped hanging out since. We get along even better than either of us imagined. :)"
So you’re saying the Dutch prefer to go Dutch ;). I like it! 
I used to love that show so much. Definitely my first fandom. Now I can’t even watch the show anymore bc it’s dragged out too much and they constantly have to keep coming up with Big Bads that are even bigger and badder than last season and honestly it’s to the point that  the Big Bads aren’t even good anymore (bad anymore?). Also Sam is just long hair and sadness now idk.
"Oh god I love short guys. My boyfriend is 5'6"" and I think he's a bit self conscious about it, but in all honesty it makes him so much hotter to me. Maybe cause I'm only 5'1"" and being with tall guys is awkward, but I've always been super attracted to shorter guys. "

He assured me he’d stop spending all of his free time playing video games, and I was hurt, and asked him what made him think he’d be a better father than a partner. If it’s so easy, why does he neglect me?

No way. "

"Thai people have an amazing resilience ingrained into their culture. I think it’s because they do not define themselves by their suffering or life’s circumstances, which would make a lot of sense seeing as they are a Buddhist country from way back."
My Mom said my nose would flare. But she'd say it was flaring when I was telling the truth so I thought she was just an idiot and tried to cover my nose so she wouldn't think I was lying when I was telling the truth. She'd think I was lying and I'd get mad. Turns out we were both idiots.

"My dad never received attention from either of his parents. My dad's older brother was his dad's favorite. They liked to hunt and fish and my dad wasn't interested in that so my grandpa didn't really give a damn about him. My dad's younger brother was 1) the baby, and 2) had some mental problems so he was constantly doted on by his mom. She was so busy watching him that she didn't make time for my dad. Nobody cared about him so he acted out and never felt like he belonged. He ended up being in and out of group homes because of his acting out. Nobody cared about him at home, the kids in the group homes didn't care about each other, and he didn't have friends at school because he was bullied for being poor. My heart always breaks for my dad when I hear about his childhood. He was completely alone."

"My parents were both first responders when they first got together. Mom was a paramedic and dad a firefighter but it was a small town so the fire department would respond to all sorts of calls as EMTs.  This happened sometime either just before or after my older brother was born.

My uncle's best friend had just had a baby.  It was around nine weeks old when they got a call to send an ambulance to the friends house early one morning.  The parents co-slept with the baby and at some point one of them rolled over onto the baby.  By the time they woke up it was too late to do anything.  My dad had to take the corpse out of the father's arms to put it into the ambulance.  He quit the fire squad that night and it still haunts him 25+ years later.

"Just their relationship at heart. She makes him realize that he is more than his most visible failure. He can live his life and not spend the rest of it atoning for what he did when he was 18. And she has someone who loves her enthusiasm even though he doesn’t understand it.

"Ha, before reading the rest of your post I was going to say the couple from Santa Clarita diet."
"The first? How lonely it would be without someone to share it with. I got unexpectedly pregnant and chose to keep the baby, with a man who was already showing some red flags from the beginning. The relationship between him and me was strained and he was emotionally abusive as hell. But as far as parenting went, that was probably the biggest stab in my heart.

He was very uninvolved, very critical, and it was just immensely empty not being able to share all the joys and the pains with someone who was just as invested as I was.

The first time our son got warded in the hospital, three days after he was born, I cried and cried not having him by my side. I wanted to pick him up as soon as possible and bring him home when he got better, but my husband wanted to wait till later because he didn’t want me leaving work (I was helping out with his family’s business). I told him I was leaving and that my son needed me, and he told me to “shut the fuck up with this stupid mom thing” and told me that my son didn’t need me at all, and that anyone who fed him was “mom” to him.

As time went on, it didn’t get better. I would tell him about new things our boy was doing, stuff he was learning, and very occasionally I’d get a comment about how cute he was. Mostly he was completely uninterested and would just grunt in acknowledgement. It hurt me so much that my son’s father couldn’t even muster up any love for him.

It’s made me really rethink wanting children. My ex-husband wanted them, but I don’t think he ever really thought about how much responsibility it was. He was an asshole and I’ll never forgive him for the things he did, and didn’t do. There’s also immense guilt for bringing my son into a world where he wasn’t completely welcomed.

***

The second is that love, even the undying, unconditional love I have for my child, takes so much work. I always knew that, but sometimes you don’t know how much. We get to choose our partners. We get to choose people with interests we like, who bring out the best in us. That doesn’t always happen with our kids. Sometimes even the happy things fill me with dread. Bringing him out on weekends gives him so much joy. He’s a huge extrovert, loves people, loves going out and doing things. I like sitting at home reading books and daydreaming. Crowds make me anxious. It’s taken a lot of effort to not only overcome these fears and feelings of dread, but to actively keep working on being upbeat so my son and I both enjoy ourselves. It seems really silly to complain about this one thing. It’s the best part of being a mom - spending time with my kid. Yet even that comes with sacrifices and often leaves me emotionally drained.

I was really burnt out for a while because I had zero time dedicated to recharging myself. I was also really depressed and broken from the abusive marriage. That’s changing now. I have a partner who’s taken a lot of interest in my son, and somehow sharing the little things with him have made it so much more rewarding and fulfilling. And I’ve also got a bit more time to myself, to be me. It’s all helped loads in being a better mother, along with therapy. At the end of the day, it does take a village. But no regrets. My little boy is a great kid - kind, empathetic, and really sweet. The world is lucky to have him in it. And I’m so lucky to be his mom.

This is absolutely tragic. I hope he finds peace knowing that he made her last minutes bearable. Imagine going through that alone. He made a good choice that day.

"My GP just happened to be a sexual health specialist. I was seeing a guy at the time who said there was something wrong with me because I had a low libido. I had a few sessions with my Dr and discussed all sorts, like sexual health and preferences. After a few sessions my Dr said it seemed like I did have a low libido but he didn't think it was something to worry about. He recommended I brought my partner in to a session to discuss everything but he refused. After telling me there was something wrong with me he refused to talk about things with a professional in the room. That's when the penny dropped for me. 

Years later and I'm not with that guy, but I do see the same Dr. I'm now married and my history came up during a consultation. My Dr asked me if I was still struggling with a low libido and I said not at all. Sex is great with my husband and whilst my libido ebbs and flows, he totally gets it and it's not a big deal at all. My Dr looked at me and just said that he knew it was because of my partner but as he refused to come in, it wouldn't be professional to say as much. We had a laugh. I'm glad I got closure and ironically the sexual therapy helped me but not for the reasons my ex thought it would. Turns out we were not sexually compatible, but I was too inexperienced to see it. 

*Edit: I should add that though my Dr didn't think anything was too wrong, we did try out some different contraceptives to see what difference that would have. Turns out I am much better off the pill, but that didn't make a difference to my time with my ex."

"My parents thankfully had alright lives \(apart from living through communism\), but my grandparents had it a lot worse. My paternal grandmother was a child during the siege of Leningrad, and although she didn't like to talk about it much there is one story she told me that I'll always remember:

She was looking for rags one day \(a popular hobby during the siege because it was cold and everyone always needed more clothes\) and saw a soldier standing next to what she thought was a pile of rags. She asked if she could have some of the rags and the soldier politely told her to go home and come back later because there might be some spare ones then. As she was leaving two grown men came up to the pile, and they had a hushed conversation for a few minutes until the soldier pointed his rifle at them and ordered them to leave.

Later that day she saw the soldier riding on a wagon filled with corpses, he had been guarding the body of someone to make sure that nobody cannibalised it. As he went past he recognised my grandmother and handed her a blanket that had probably been used as a death shroud earlier that day."

"I too had a pet rabbit. For whatever reason my dad got it in his head that it was okay to take it and bludgeon it to death then cook it and my mom went along with it. I remember bargaining with them that they could sell my communion dress if they wouldn’t hurt the rabbit. I refused to eat supper when I realized what had happened... and yes, they still sold my dress.  My dad hung the fur in the basement on the clothesline, and left there. 

Of course there is more, but I try to be a better person and parent than what I had growing up.  So far, so good."
"Yea, only thing worse is being born youngest, or oldest"
"This. My parents cared for me - I was always fed, had a roof over my head, was never hit. But my parents were both so emotionally absent and lacking in physical affection and good communication that I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness, emptiness, fear of social rejection, etc. I've only recently had an ""a-ha"" moment that tied my own mental health and attachment issues to the care my parents weren't able to give me growing up."

"I'm American, I worry that women are losing access to healthcare for female-specific conditions from pregnancy coverage to pap smears.  I can see things like access to free birth control being taken away or pregnancy being removed from health plans.  Or stuff like walk-in clinics that you can get STD and pap testing such as PP closing down.

I am older now and I have more resources where I'm no longer worried about this for myself - if birth control started to cost money, I could afford it.  I have a private practice doctor I go to.  I worry about this for younger women."

"Met up via Tinder with someone from work who ended up talking about marriage very shortly after we started hooking up.

When I stopped seeing him (due to his clinginess &amp; political leanings), his friends at work were apparently upset with my decision &amp; one of them began to spread rumors that I'm sleeping with *all* my male friends.

One of those friends has a long-term girlfriend, and she caught wind of these rumors. It almost destroyed their relationship.

"I am a procrastinator and I have ADD. I learned that, if I made too big of a list, I got defeated before I even started and my life force would drain out of me. I keep a master list as I think of things on my ""Notes"" app on my iphone. Then, at home, I have a small, erasable whiteboard. I put 5 things on it. Each day, I look at it and decide how many I'll do, how long they'll take, and what time is best. As I finish, I erase an item. I never put more than 5 on the board. Secondly - nothing helps you become disciplined better than just walking for 30 minutes every day. It's so pleasurable, and as you do this, weirdly, you have more initiative, and your brain seems to be able to process, organize and problem solve better. That's all. Good luck."

"I agree. there is so much breast is best propaganda flying around pre and post birth that I genuinely felt like I was doing something wrong. 

Then I read an article floating around Facebook one morning about a mother who kept breastfeeding her baby despite the child starving, not realizing she didn’t have enough supply and that’s why she was feeding him constantly and for hours at a time. Eventually he died from starvation and dehydration. She titled it “if I had fed my child just one bottle of formula, he might still be alive” or something along those lines. It still hurts to think about and read that article but at the time I knew I could absolutely not become that mother myself. So I stopped feeling shame around it and lying to her pediatrician saying I was “supplementing” when in reality all her bottles by that point were formula. "

"I live in Australia, and haven't really dated here but from my own experience, the guy usually pays for the first couple of dates then 50/50 afterwards. It is normal for guys to buy girls flowers, and gifts etc. Australia is quite diverse so other people may have a totally different experience. Everyone is pretty straight forward and honest about their feelings. Most of my friends move quite quickly with relationships, usually moving in with each other within \~6 months. There is a big casual sex scene here too.

In Sweden, casual sex seems to be a big thing. Usually you'd do this for a few months then assume your together in a relationship if you have feelings for each other. Swedes don't date, my partner said I was the first ever person he took on an actual ""date"" and give flowers to. He only did this realising our cultural differences. Rather, they have fika \(have coffee/tea\) every now and again.  Each party pays 50/50, and everything is equal. In comparison to Aus, Swedes seem to move in relationships very slowly.

The Australian and Swedish scene are very different!"

I used to cook the family dinner when I was a teenager as my parents worked and both had long commutes. No matter how sneaky he was I could always hear my dad having a taste from pan from the other room - he'd always go 'How do you and your mother do that????'. It was mainly cause he'd go quiet so I knew he was up to something! I think it's the same with kids.

I think a lot of them don't realise how many of their products are high-end or even designer. The average person cannot be splashing out on 50+ new makeup products every month like them. I get one new foundation bottle every six months or so because the good shit is nearly $70.

Also I really wish there was an alternative to fake eyelashes. I don't want to put glue that close to my eyeball but mascara doesn't always plump them up enough. "
"I didn't walk out, but after a particularly bad phone call, I gave them about 4 days notice instead of the standard 2 weeks. It was a call center job. Customers would call up and yell, and I was told to adhere to the company's policies when dealing with customers. Well, the pissed off customer would ask for my manager, and she would immediately give them what they wanted, no questions asked. So I would spend 5-10 minutes arguing with a person about something, only to have her do whatever they wanted. I know that happens in all customer service jobs, but this job was 95% complaints, so it happened all day long. I was wasting my breath and my sanity, so I told her I couldn't deal any more. That was a Monday and I told her I would stick it out for the rest of the week, but I was going to lose it.

When I woke up on my last day, it had snowed 8 inches, so I called off. I wasn't going to drive in the snow only to get there and be yelled at for another 9 hours. I had no other job lined up, but I didn't care. My sanity was more important."

"How to assess whether my partner would be a good father, and (possibly more importantly) a good co-parent.

I had no clue. No fucking clue. And in hindsight, I probably didn't think about it very deeply - I didn't think it was very important, because I didn't have a dad around much and my mum did just fine, and so did I.

Really - it's the most important thing there is to know.

I can't really say this without sharing what I've learned so here's my take:

**A good father:**

- Is a good role model - someone you'd be proud if your kids grew up to be like and who you genuinely admire.

- Does not believe that he has to dominate or control others. Handles conflict non-aggressively.

- Is willing to put others before himself, at least some of the time

- Is good when you are sick, and/or treats animals and other ""inferiors"" (e.g. employees, younger siblings) well.

- Has dealt with his demons or is self-aware enough to know when they need dealing with, so they don't negatively impact on others.

**A good co-parent:**

- Discusses topics with you even when they find them hard - does not shut down discussion or joke it away. Listens to you. Shares their concerns with you so you can have open communication.

- Partakes in a fair distribution of housework, emotional labour and finances. Is prepared to discuss and adjust when this doesn't feel fair.

- Has core beliefs which are compatible with yours on subjects like drugs, religion, money, socialising, etc. Find this out, don't assume.

- Gets on with your family, and vice versa (unless one of you is no contact with family)

- Has broadly similar/compatible life goals in terms of family planning and lifestyle.

- Encourages you. Never puts you down. Respects and admires you.

- Cares about your feelings and the impact of their own actions on you (and others).

- Compensates for your weaknesses; has weaknesses of their own which you find no worse than a mild inconvenience (so you don't feel resentful compensating for them).

- Overall makes your life and any problems feel easier to cope with when they are there.

- Sees this whole parenting thing as a shared project, goal, journey, whatever you want to call it - and is in it *with you* - not simply as a support while *you* do this thing, but as a 50/50 participant, however that looks for the two of you.

"Yes. When I met my SO he had a bunch of issues and tbh he was stressing me tf out. I sat him down and told him that I loved him, but I couldn’t deal with all of his issues because 1) I’m in no way qualified to do so 2) I won’t deal with the stress and anguish he had been causing me. I told him that if he immediately got himself a therapist, started working on himself, and showing improvement then I would support him in doing so. 

He started looking for a therapist the next day. Almost three years later he has come so far and is so much happier it’s absolutely incredible. "
"My grandmother in law came to the US from Latvia and she never talked about her experience until she was on hospice. The son she left in Latvia had been found in Germany about ten years before she died, but we still never heard the full story. The stories she told about having to eat grass to stay alive on a train are haunting. I know I can read a ton of more descriptive studies, but knowing the person who lived through it is so incredible."
I sort of want to read your tumblr now
"oh crap, this whole time I thought it was silent but deadly... my bad.

"Got stuck in a dress in a changing room at H&amp;M, braless, with the dress covering my face and with my tits out. I had to call on personnel for help. "
"I am 38 weeks pregnant. I am sick of having conversations about my weight.

""How much weight have you gained?"" I don't know, Karl. But my gut is only have the size of yours so shut the fuck up. "
"My boss was heavily underpaying me (think 12 dollars an hour vs 30 industry standard) and commented that his daughter wasn’t ever going to be married due to her being raped at 14 because no one would want her. 


Goodbye sir. Fuck your sexist attitude "
"Was bullied in middle school. Had two ppl i considered friends, then heard them laughing at me behind my back.

Oh and the first and only boyfriend i ever had only asked me out bcs he liked my bestfriend and couldn’t get her - apparently i was low hanging fruit"

"In Poland (at least when I lived there 10 years ago) there was still an expectation of gallantry and gentlemanliness from men: holding doors open, giving the girl flowers, saving her a seat etc. This isn’t necessarily courtship related, some consider it simple good manners to do some of those things. 

In the UK, there’s more expected equality. You’re more like friends, hanging out and then eventually becoming more intimate. "
"Not making me follow through with things. I’ve changed now that I’m on my own but I never had any sense of accountability. Because when I was younger and didn’t want to do something like finish soccer or go to camp after I signed up they would let me do what I wanted. I push my kids to really try things and give it a shot. If they don’t like it after it’s finished, they don’t have to do it again, but they tried. "
"On a small scale, my parents are religious, believe in The One, and marriage bonding two souls together for eternity. No sex or cohabitation before marriage.

Living in LA and surrounding myself with sex-positive poly people, sometimes it feels like an entirely different world. I'm much happier when sex is considered a healthy activity, and getting rid of shame has been hard but feels better every day. "
This is what terrifies me about having children. Not being able to cope with that 
"Right, what this person said. 

You should be calling out the cat caller because you wanna hold men accountable their thinking it’s okay to do that to women, NOT because you think a woman needs saving.

That's an even better reason for her to go to cosmetology school then. She can learn not to do that.
"Taking really cute Instagram pictures. The attention and comments afterward can be fun, but standing and posing and arranging your surroundings just so and getting the right lighting and timing the fake laughs is just a huge pain in the ass."
"They insisted our family problems were nobody's business, including our own. I know not everyone wants their dirty laundry aired, but I had nobody to talk to and would get punished if I tried to tell my parents they were wrong about anything.

My brother was diagnosed with a behavior disability but before they could get testing done to see exactly what it was, my parents went into heavy denial and stopped seeing that doctor. My brother went on to be abusive. I would get in trouble asking the neighbours for help with his full on 12 year old tantrums. Instead, I had to drag him to his room that had a lock on the outside of the door. I wasn't allowed friends over when they weren't home because my brother would likely chase them around the house with a hockey stick.

My brother as an adult has been physically abusive to his ex, and is raising his daughter inappropriately. My parents are pigeon holed as becoming the guardians of my niece. I'm stuck in therapy because I don't know how to stand up for myself or voice opinions without a fear of a huge dramatic argument pending."

"In 7th or 8th grade a boy in my class said, ""You're just so smart that everyone can't wait to hear what you're going to say next."" 

I'm not that smart, but that comment has always stuck with me as one of the nicest things anyone has said to me. "
Ngl this sounds really cute and made me smile
"I'm American and live in Taiwan. In Taiwan, one way of showing you care is by telling someone what to do. Not in a controlling way, in an advice-giving way. When I first started dating my Taiwanese boyfriend (and tbh sometimes now, too haha) he'd tell me stuff like ""Don't eat that ice cream when you're sick. Eat vegetables."" or ""Just so you know, that shelf is high so you should be careful."" or he'd like, nag me a about going to the doctor or eating more vegetables or whatever. Mom kind of stuff haha. At first I was like ""DUDE I'm an adult and I've been living alone in a foreign country for several years. I think I can handle deciding when to eat vegetables."" One time I got super annoyed during one of these instances and he was honestly taken aback that I didn't see his advice as cute and caring. He told me ""even if you don't want to do it, at least pretend you're considering my advice and I'll be happy."" Haha. 

I've since realized this is a thing everyone just does. I get ""advice"" from elders, friends, my boyfriend, my boyfriend's family, etc. It's just a thing people do. "
I feel like everyone is getting lonelier and more anxious.  Lots of people don't have any friends. I worry it's even worse for younger generations.
"In terms of 'what do women like in a man' type posts, a lot of men are insecure about what women think of us because men are 'told' by society that a lot of our value rests on our success romantically/sexually with women. There's a lot of perceived pressure to do well with girls for straight guys and peoples self-esteem is bound up in it. Also, reddit has many socially awkward, introverted men in its user base who may be particularly anxious about this."
"The myriad of thoughts I have:

""Oh no, we always do this position. Is he sick of this yet? Is it bor....OH FUCK BUT IT FEELS SO GOOD. GO HARDER. NO SOFTER. OH GOD NO DONT STOP""

""He's never made that noise before. Oh no, I don't know what I did. What did I do? How do I get him to make that noise again?”

""OW! Well that hurt. Guess that's where my cervix is today.""

""I hope he doesn't look at my butthole.""

*Tummy makes whale noise* ""Oh no, I bet he thinks I'm going to toot. I don't think I have to toot. WHAT IF I TOOT?""

""PLEASE DONT STOP. No, but seriously, I've had, like, 3-5 orgasms by now and my vagina is closing up on me. Please don't stop because I want you to come before I break."""
"As I'm approaching 30, I realized procrastination has become the standard for me, and apparently it's not something I 'grow out of'. Because of this, among other reasons, I will never be as ambitious or 'successful' as my peers, but I enjoy my life. I know I sound like a lazy bastard, and perhaps I am, and that's cool."
"He recently got a white baseball cap.  The first time I saw him in it, my vagina dried up like a California raisin. It still hasn't gone back to normal.  I keep hoping he'll misplace it somewhere, but he's guarding the stupid thing with his life.  He has to replace his sunglasses every freaking week, but he'll probably still be wearing that damn hat when we're in a nursing home.  At this rate, we're never going to have sex again. "
"Girl, you and my sleep apnea would get along "
Teenagers will do the same shit you and your friends did but earlier and with evidence on social media. Try to stay ahead of it 
"That is a good answer, because the girl will appreciate your help that's for sure but also will want to get the hell out of that situation as soon as possible so might ignore you and not want to talk to you after it all. "
"So honestly, why is he still your partner? You seem quite aware of his limitations and are comfortable conveying them to him, but what keeps you with him?"
But don't you know a woman's role in public is to be silent but beautiful? /s
"Whatever grandma, these flies are delicious."
"Critically important, for the larger issues. I don’t want to build a life with someone who’s not on the same page about things like LGBT rights, feminism, abortion, immigration, racial equality, etc. We can disagree or have in-depth conversations about the smaller issues but if we’re not both in alignment on things that are important to me, then it’s an immediate deal breaker."
Work out the childcare stuff beforehand. Daycare is expensive. Someone is gonna get pressured to stay home if things get tight financially. 
"Never has a show pissed away more love from fans. Like, the first series was decent and set up some interesting stuff. Then Moffat decided he loved the smell of his own farts more than writing a good show and it got bad super fast. I was a SUPERFAN (like, multiple watches, writing fan fic, recording podfics) of Series 1 but dipped after Series 2 and got to watch the Series 4 trainwreck from outside the fandom thank Christ. "
