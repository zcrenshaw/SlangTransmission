"It was my former friend, started off the day with brunch, which was great. Then she wanted to gamble and expected everyone to give her money when we got to the casino. I think we ended up giving her like $150 to gamble with. She blew that in like half an hour. She then wanted us to cough up more money. Hard pass from me, balling on a budget.

We went for an early dinner and she got rip roaring drunk off margaritas. Like she was two steps away from being the drunk girl crying in a corner drunk. She then wanted to go it a strip club, her maid of honor bought her a lap dance and apparently paid for a little something extra cause they went in a back room and came out smelling like sex. Then she wants taco bell, proceeds to smash five soft tacos and then vomits it all back up in the back seat of my car. 

No, she didn't pay for it to get cleaned. That marriage lasted all of six months before she cheated and he found out. "
"For quite a while I was the only woman on my team working alongside much older men (its a heavily male dominated industry) so blatantly sexist things would happen to me a lot. 

It was ALWAYS just assumed that I was the one taking notes. 

When we had consultants or visitors in our meetings, they always assumed I was an admin and would come directly to me if they had questions about coffee or setting up their equipment to the AV system. 

The absolute worst though was that when the host of the meeting would go around the room and make introductions, all of the men were introduced by their full name and title (e.g. “This is Joe Smith, Director of Operations.”) But when it came to me it was a half assed, condescending, “And this is Lucy, she keeps the world spinning around here!” Literally every time I had to interject with “Thank you, yes, Lucy Bluth, Director of Business Development.” Annoying as hell. "
"I've only been to one, and I found it IMMENSELY frustrating that the maid of honour thought that a group of 9 could walk into a Mexican restaurant, on Cinco de Mayo, on a Saturday, in a city with a population of 6 million, and not need a fucking reservation."
"Mechanical, overly long descriptions of positions that end up being impossible to follow, like *Sally's hips lifted into the air as John entered her from behind, and Jane grabbed her and held her close for a kiss while John spread his legs for a deeper angle and Sally placed her head between Jane's legs and* like what the fuck is going on here, draw me a diagram if you're gonna insist on me knowing exactly where everyone is at all times.

Similarly, extremely precise descriptions of how people look, down to the cup size of someone's breasts and exact inch measurement of their dick. Also, stop giving men 9 inch dicks. 

And while you're at it, stop mentioning the cervix. ""John's dick pushed into her cervix"" is not a sexy sentence, it is a horrifying nightmare. 

The word moist. Don't use it.

Finally, I can't bear it when writers try to be clever with genital euphemisms. Like, there's nothing wrong with dick, cock, pussy, ass, etc. Please don't make me read about Tim's bologna pony battering down the hatches of Daniel's dripping shit-hatch."
"A college friend got married the summer after we graduated. Her husband had his bachelor party the weekend before in the same city, and he was honest about what they did that weekend - including going to a strip club. So for the bachelorette things are going normal, we're having fun at a nice restaurant but after a few drinks the bride decides we need to go to the same stripclub ""to just see what it is like."" So we go. The bride started crying once she saw the naked women dancing. The maid of honor (whose boyfriend was also at the bachelor party) starts crying. The sister of the bride starts crying. So there we are, about a dozen women at a strip club, a quarter of the group crying. What a way to celebrate getting married. "

"So many comments on women’s appearances are unnecessary.  A lot of “just being nice” is super creepy. 
I smiled back at a man once when he told me to while I was walking downtown. He followed me for nearly ten minutes. So I don’t smile on my commute anymore. Even if they mean something as a compliment, what I hear is a threat. 
In general, if you wouldn’t say it to a naked man three times your size or want him to say it to you, maybe don’t. "
"Mine. 

I was pregnant so we planned a chill dinner at my favourite restaurant.

Then: swine flu. My guests dropped like flies and ended up chill dinner for four. All good friends, all good.

So there's me and Guest One sitting there. Guest One gives me a tiara to wear. Fine.

Now there's me with a tiara and Guest One sitting there. Guest Two arrives. Guest Two got married four months before this party but arrives not wearing her wedding ring. Guest Two has moved in with her parents and initiated divorce proceedings on the grounds that her husband managed to hide a hardcore drug addiction and a lot of debt until they were married. Guest Two cries. A lot. 

Guest One and I are reeling and comforting when Guest Three arrives. Guest Three is a doctor, and has no tact. As we're ordering food she asks me about my vaginal secretions and the thickness of my cervix. The waiter drops his pen and someone else serves us for the rest of the night.

The food arrives. It is good. Guest Three takes the opportunity to inform me very casually that someone I was very close to before I emigrated has died, young, tragically and heroically. She goes into some fairly graphic detail.

I'm bolting my food because fuck everything about this but I'm still pregnant and hungry. Suddenly Surprise Guest Four appears. She lives 400 miles away and wasn't coming. I think this is a lovely surprise but she sits down and begins sobbing. She's home because her dad's currently having emergency heart surgery and she can't just sit in his empty house and wait for the phone.

Home by 10pm. Fuck this party. "

"Telling me what I *really* think, after I’ve just said what I think. Or I describe an aspect of my personality and they say, “No, I know you're just saying that and you’re really like *this*.”

"Yup, I went to school for early childhood education and English, with the idea that I would be a kindergarten teacher and write.

I hated student-teaching, but thought it would get better.  A month in, and I was completely miserable, and was talking to my parents about it.  I offhand said that I should have been a lawyer instead.

My mom told me ""women lawyers are bitches"".

So I registered for the LSAT that night, did well, got accepted to a good school moved across country and now I'm a practicing attorney. 

So I did a career change out of spite.  And I'm so much happier."

"Getting my experiences dismissed. This only happens with some guy friends but never with girls: I’ll tell even a very simple story about some minor inconvenience I experienced (the cashier was kinda rude and called me ‘sweetie’ a lot), and some guy will invariably suit up in armor to defend the cashier. It’s bizarre, but if I complain about someone, dudes will suddenly find a renewed depth of empathy for this poor misaligned soul who accepted my cash, because maybe he was working two jobs/is part of the older generation/I care too much and he didn’t mean it like that/that’s not what happened. 

It’s good to show compassion for others, and to not accept all stories at pure face value. But they don’t question each other’s stories. They’re just telling me they can’t believe even my most boring everyday experiences. "
"Life is what you make it.

Don't want to get married? Ok, don't get married.

There are plenty of households where both spouses share the housework and emotional labor. There are plenty of households with happy spouses that don't have children. There are plenty of happy single people. There are plenty of happy couples that never get married.

I'm not gonna lie and tell you that you won't get pushback from people who think you should live the way they want you to, but just stand your ground and make your life into what you want it to be.

Yolo. Curate your life to bring you happiness."
"I don't really speak about those things with men in my real life, but plenty of men (and women) on Reddit refuse to see the blatant sexism of many aspects of our society.

 I really hate the dudes who come in and say they think being a woman is some kind of privilege because we ""have it easier."" Like it's a benefit that people have such low expectations of women that they don't hold us to high standards and consider us weak and submissive and delicate things to be protected. I really wonder how they'd like it if people viewed them that way. I don't think they'd enjoy it at all."
"I left my ex of two years after months of misery. Took a lot of time to myself, buried myself in my studies (college student), and obsessed over self care. I realized I’m a catch. I have an extremely bright future, strong emotional intelligence, and a love of love to give. Especially to myself. I’m extremely proud to say that I am someone that I would look up to.

My favorite thing about myself is that I’m available and fully capable of improving myself. I love finding flaws because it means I better understand myself in relation to the world around me."
"The degree to which I get interrupted, condescended to, and not taken seriously. 

A lot of guys will be like ""this is a problem that happens to guys too."" Which I am sure it does, some people just suck. But many refuse to believe it happens *more* to women."
"EVERYTHING. My girlfriend just doesn't understand how I can just watch her for such long periods of time. Like if she's focusing really hard on something, she'll start chewing on her lip and it's the most adorable and sexy thing ever. Or when she wakes up, stretches, and runs her hands through her hair. Or the way she walks. Or the little tilt of her head and squinted eyes when she thinks I'm up to something; which, if we're being fair, I usually am.

But yeah, pretty much anything women do gets me going, so long as I find them attractive."

"I dated my ex for almost 5 years when he dumped me. It was a rough few years as I recovered from that heartbreak. In the months after breaking up, I took the money I'd been saving for a wedding and booked an impromptu 8 week trip across the African continent. I quit my job and applied to grad school in another country. 

And while there were rough times, I had the time of my life travelling (I booked more trips, my ex didn't like to travel), living in NYC, and studying a subject I loved. I made new friends, dated, and landed my dream job (which wouldn't have been possible while dating my ex). 

A few years later I met my now husband. We met and married in a little more than a year. We adopted a dog, bought a gorgeous house, and have a happy and healthy marriage. Life is infinitely better than it ever was with my ex. "
"I left a 6-figure US$ job as a cancer-researcher to stay home with our baby. My husband did the same. We estimate we have 4-6 years before our financial situation requires us to go back to work. It's fun watching our daughter grow, be there for her firsts -- first step, first word, first run, first time going up stairs, etc. -- at this point, she's 20 months and babbling non-sense, but we're looking forward to making sense of it very soon."

"Honestly I think I would appreciate it. Sure, it would hurt but it would prevent me from internalizing and overthinking the rejection. It would also let me understand their perspective and hopefully make the rejection easier to deal with knowing how they feel about me. It also takes a lot for someone to be honest and respectful when rejecting someone, and I find that to be meaningful."
"Acting like things that are mostly liked by women are automatically more frivolous or silly than things liked by men. 

For example, mocking “valley girl speech” more than “bro” speech. Mocking horse girls more than car guys or gamer guys. Mocking the bad Fifty Shades franchise more than the bad Transformers movies. Acting like artists like Justin Bieber are automatically embarrassing to listen to because the fandom is mostly girls.

If you look at pop culture overall, it’s shocking how much airtime and mockery is devoted to things liked by girls and women vs things liked by boys and men. "
"This is a pretty loaded question, and also kind of private but I’ll give it a go. 

I think there are some great answers here, and you highlighted on important factors like firepower, mobility, and protection- but what about practicality and comfort?

My pick is the Action Mobil Global XRS 7200, an armored motor home. While it would need to be outfitted with weapons it has the safety of a tank and all the comforts of home. It’s agile enough to unleash go off-road fury and I can customize the firepower, because why not? If I’m in a war zone- this is my ride. "
That was wild
"Also in a male dominated field, and the taking notes thing really hits home. My immediate group of coworkers are great and I don't experience this with them, but working with clients, oof.

"I don't send out hints. I tell people when I don't want to speak.

I feel like you shouldn't have to seek out hints. You aren't a passive supportive character in your life. Are you interested in the conversation? Continue until told otherwise. Are you unsure of their intentions? Ask. If you're not enjoying the conversation, poking it with a stick until it moves isn't going to entertain you. 

We make things too scary for ourselves, especially since there are no guidelines. Tons of people, like myself, don't enjoy conversations unless they're* in person or on a video call. Or maybe, also like me, they only reply when they feel they have substance behind their words and will go days between replies but feel just as enthusiastic about the person. Tons of people cannot convey their personalities through text. You lose a lot of the person behind the words through the medium.

Be direct on both sides, don't just assume or leave others to assume. "
Woman cheated on her husband-to-be with a male stripper. Warmed my heart that I wasn't the one that had to give her the ultimatum of telling her fiance or them telling him for her.
I've never understood the bachelor party strip club thing. It seems like it's better suited for a divorce party. What's the point of paying hand over fist to have a stranger grind on you and then deal with the fallout once the spouse finds out? 
"Being taken seriously as a voice of authority.

My job involves lots of client interaction. Clients *love* me.  I'm very knowledgeable in my field, and if I don't know something, I WILL find the answer.

Buuuut, I can't count count the number of times where I've told a client something twenty eight different times, been ignored, and then handed them over to a male colleague only to the matter resolved in five minutes by the guy saying the exact same thing I'd been saying for two months.

If it comes from me, it's a suggestion. If it comes from a man, it's The Word of God."
"Wait, she blew a stripper in front of her mother?!?!?!"
"I hosted the group at my house between activities to get food and do a little pre gaming before the bars. The bride, for the many years that I have known her, has never been able to keep shots down, even fruity ones which have low alcohol content. Naturally, she decides we should all do several rounds of fireball together. After each shot, she vomits. Instead of running to the bathroom, she yells “FRONT OR BACK YARD” at me as she runs out of the house... passing my bathroom on the way. I begged her to just throw up in my bathroom instead, but she heard none of it. I think she threw up in my yard three or four different times. I was pretty salty about it.

When we got to the bar she was incoherent and still vomiting so I asked the bartenders to serve her virgin drinks for the rest of the night without telling her. It worked."
"My bf doesn’t really initiate EVER, so I feel your pain. He is always willing but never starts anything. It really sucks so much. It makes me feel like he doesn’t care about me or that he would rather not have sex with me. Sometimes, I’ll be honest, I even get angry about it. I will tell myself, “Okay, don’t initiate sex. Let him do it and see how long it takes.” But then I feel bad and don’t want him to think I’m mad at him or anything is wrong, so I give in and initiate. Ugh. I’ve brought this up with him before (twice in two years) and his response is, “I like when you initiate.” So my response, “So then you understand why I would also like it if you initiated.” He agrees and says that makes sense. And then NEVER CHANGES. Frustrating. Sorry for the rant. This week was one of the weeks I decided to test him and see if he would initiate. We are on day 6 of no initiating, so I’m starting to feel cranky. Lol "
"When I was in college to be a vet tech, I had a big test on the heart, lungs, circulatory system and the instructor gave us no information. She told us to figure it out. My husband is a paramedic and offered to help. He dug out his book from school and went over everything with me, then quizzed me. He was so patient, which he isn't normally. Our boys were running around being boys...loud and energetic, but he was focused solely on helping me. Only three people passed the test the first time. I was one of them and I had the highest score. "
I hate people that can't do basic planning
"This was a few years ago and I was friends with the groom from high school. They rented out a club for a few hours for the party. Fast forward to the party, the woman of the hour is getting a lap dance and is getting egged on by the maid of honor to touch and be interactive. She's running her hands all over him and it gets to his underwear. He wanted her to take off his thong with her teeth, so she goes for it, but once it goes past his ass, the underwear stop moving. I crane my neck to look around and she's got his semi-erect dick in her mouth. Half of the women there were too drunk to understand the gravity of the situation, the bride included, and the rest of us were looking at each other like, ""What the fuck?"" But most of us were too stunned to actually do anything about it. That went on for about a minute or so before she started trying to take *her* clothes off and none of us were having that.

Like four women physically pulled her away and were just shouting in her face like an Italian soap opera, and I hear her own mother, as well as one of the bridesmaids, telling her to tell her fiance or they'd be doing it. Heard from the groom that the mother sat down with them to make sure she didn't lie and made her daughter explain herself.

They also reported the stripper for going against his agency's policy. Fairly sure he got fired for it.

I went to the bachelor party as well and aside from some titty and ass-grabbing of the stripper at her own behest, he didn't do anything wrong of the sorts."

"Being forced into a position (mainly with relationships) where you have to ask 2, 3 times for your partner to do the bare minimum \- and made even worse when you're then turned into the bad guy for asking.

"The euphemisms for penis and vagina. In one erotically charged fantasy book, I was genuinely unsure if they were talking about a sword or a cock.

I also read a book (written by a woman) where a girl orgasmed as soon as the guy entered her. Like, have you had sex?

edit: Just to clear it up, the scene is in ""Fate of the Tearling"" and reads:

&gt; He shoved inside her and Katie came, not even expecting it.

She actually manages three before the end of the paragraph. I think he might have a magic penis."
"Perhaps not sexist exactly but I think related: safety. Had to explain to my boyfriend and his friend that when I dated on tinder I had a rule where the first two dates/meetings were in public, I arrived alone, and I left alone. I didn’t want a dude knowing where I lived or even which direction or neighborhood. His friend commented on how he probably creeped a few girls out (innocently) asking them on a ~romantic~ midnight bike ride. Neither of them had thought about it. 

Women take safety seriously and there are a lot of situations I don’t think guys realize. "

"Veterans support groups. It isn't a popular topic because only 14&amp;#37; of the American Army are women and we're the 14&amp;#37; of the 1&amp;#37;, but it's frustrating and horrible for those who have served. Men assume you did nothing in your service but put out sexual favors to get ahead (not true) and that you did nothing but sit at a desk or screw off. If you say you did Something,  you're dismissed as a liar immediately (I've been accused of Stolen Valor). If you go to the VFW or other private Veteran support group, you're dismissed or even treated as though you don't ""belong"". I've been having a low\-key debate with a buddy who is in a Veteran motorcycle group (who does charity work and things like clean up cemeteries) over the past year (asking a lot of pointed questions without actually bringing out the Sword) about why women are not invited into the MC. I know why. Because their sexist wives think if a woman is a member and goes on trips, they're automatically going to try to sleep with all the husbands, but no one will say that out loud. But try to tell other men Veterans about what you're going through and they'll make every excuse in the book as to why you're ""wrong"" or ""blowing it out of proportion"". It's the most isolating thing I've ever experienced in my life. I also realized I've become more strident and bitter, but it's hard not to when everyone is telling you 10 years of your life don't matter, when they're not telling you it never existed at all. I don't expect replies. I'm venting."
"The whole thing was a damn nightmare. First off, the bride and the Maid of Honor lived 3.5 hours from the nearest Big City. I lived in the Big City. So the initial plan was that everyone would meet in the City, we'd rent a house or something, and hit up some local bars. Oh no no no. Instead, the Bride and MOH chose a town known for it's waterparks, 5 hours out of the way of literally everyone but whatever.

A few days before the Bachelorette weekend, the MOH tells all of the guests (6 of us, with the bride) to Venmo her $80 for the hotel and to bring our own alcohol because since she and the Bride are moms they're both poor and that way we can pregame and not blow a shit ton of money (nevermind the fact that both were Stay At Home moms whose husbands paid for everything from their share of the hotel to their student loans). 

I show up in the Water Park City to find that we are staying in the dingiest motel I've ever seen. Our unit is a grimy three-bed, two-room number that even a cockroach would run screaming from. 

Five of us are ""on time"" and so we wind up meandering the three-block 'main street' until the last bridesmaid shows up. It should be noted that this bridesmaid, ""Lou"", was dirt poor (and also a mom). She had pinched and saved the exact amount of money to make this possible based on what the Bride and MOH had told her.

Everyone's all together and starving, so we snag dinner at a godforsaken Pizza Ranch filled with screaming children. Then, the Bride tells us that we'll be spending all of the next day at one of the largest Water Parks (known for being very very child friendly) and so we should pack a picnic. So we go to Walmart where Lou buys all the food the Bride and MOH want on her (I shit you not) foodstamps because she wants to feel like she's contributing somehow.

That night, we don't pregame at all because the MOH tells us she got us bottle service in this ""great"" bar just on the city limits. Hell yeah--free liquor and no out of pocket money? Let's go! MISTAKE. I wind up paying for the cab (thinking nbd it's 10 min away) which winds up being a van-cab thing because there's six of us and also not a single damn Lyft/Uber in the city. Turns out, this bar is a tiny ass hole-in-the-wall that's 30 min away (a $60 cab ride) where their version of bottle service is giving us a small bottle of barrail vodka and mixers. When we leave, I pay for the cab back ($80) because none of the other bridesmaids piped up.

Next day was the same shit. We spent all day at a waterpark filled with screaming children with the plan to be to go back, eat a picnic-style dinner, pregame, and go out to the local bars. That didn't happen. The Bride and MOH decide last minute that they want to go to somewhere fancy. As in, the only ""fancy"" restaurant in this god awful town where the prices were jacked up because there was no competition.

Honestly, I very quietly offered to pay for Lou's dinner because I knew she couldn't afford it (she'd be pinching her pennies all day and I grew up poor and recognized the ""oh shit"" face she had). She got a steak and a cocktail. The Bride talked about how her husband gave her money for the trip. She didn't buy a single thing or even offer. 

I didn't buy the bride a single drink that night when we went to the bar but you know who got stuck with the cab fair again? Me. The Bride wound up crying at the end of the night because we were all being mean to her when in reality the MOH and i were trying to figure out how to call a cab in a town with no cell service.

The next day the Bride and MOH required us to go brunch as a goodbye meal. It was an IHOP.

I'm no longer friends with any of them.

TLDR; I pay for 30 min cab rides to go to a bar that Bride and MOH want to go to bc of the bottle service, bottle service is a tiny bottle of vodka. Bridesmaid is too poor to afford fancy dinner, so I cover it."

"When I realized that the guy I'd been pining after for all of high school was treating me like a back up option. Like an ego stroke. Like the girl who would stick around when every other woman he pursued rejected him. He would give me just enough ""love"" every now and then to keep me hanging on, but he never really cared. And I honestly thought that, one sweet day, we could be in love.

For the longest time, he defined my beauty and self worth. He liked thick thighs, so my thick thighs were okay. He liked the booty, so my booty was okay. He liked black girls, so my black skin and features were okay. Except, without him, my self esteem was still shot.

Us going to different colleges finally let me see everything in a new light, and I just felt incredibly stupid. Years wasted crushing on a guy and letting him define my worth. Once I realized that our situationship wasn't what I thought it was, I had to find a new source of love and encourage and respect. Which turned out to be myself.

All of that started a wave of positivity toward myself which I'd never been capable of before. I was telling myself that I'm smart, that I'm pretty, that I'm worthy of love, and so on and so forth.

The things that I once believed I could not be without him, I just inherently was. Crazy."

"This woman and I are no longer friends, and her bachelorette party is part of the reason.


I had a friend from elementary school I still kept in contact with.  I met her for dinner and we were talking about her engagement, I was asking questions about her wedding, being polite.  I asked who her bridesmaids were, and she felt awkward for not asking me, so on the drive home she called and asked me to be a bridesmaid, spur of the moment.  I said yes as I was caught off guard, then backed out when I realized how much $$ and time it was going to cost, and my work schedule was really bad at the time.  Plus SO and I were trying to get pregnant (I would later find out I'm infertile, and I didn't want to be pregnant and doing all the shit she expected her bridesmaids to do).

Well she took exception to this, but still wanted me to be involved.  Whatever, it's her day.  

Something everyone in my life knows about me: I'm a vegan. Have been for years.  I don't expect everyone to cater to me, but by god, she could not have planned a more anti-vegan party if she tried.  All the drinks had milk or gelatin in them.  The place she chose for dinner was a steakhouse where you pick out your own steak and the only vegan thing there was a side salad, minus cheese, with oil and vinegar.   

After sitting around for an hour waiting on her to finish getting ready, then 2.5 hours at the restaurant (no reservation, had to wait for a table), then the saddest salad I have ever choked down in my life, and listening to ""so and so is a vegetarian, but she's having sides"" (she also ate bacon so....not a vegetarian) Also everyone kept comparing the 'good vegetarian' to the 'bad vegan' because she gave in and ate bacon, and I wouldn't, the bride reveals that now everyone has to chip in $280 to pay for the party bus she insisted on renting, to drive around wearing dicks and go to bars.  Not my scene, I was starving (it was like hours into the 'party' at this point) so I bailed.  And she was pissed I bailed.  


Anyway, I found out about the infertility a few months before her wedding, told her about it, and a month before her wedding she texted me ""You pregnant yet?"" (I said I didn't want to be pregnant in her wedding party).  So we are no longer friends.  


I just can't deal with that level of selfishness and cruelty.

"Ugh I remember being in a thread about sexist things women put up with working in computer science and someone said something about it being assumed you'd take notes and a ton of dudes felt the need to jump in saying ""Well it's probably not because youre a woman, its because you're youngest/most junior/most senior/have the best hand writing/etc"" (without anything suggesting any of those things are true)

I don't know why all the men in that thread really felt the need to dispute that point specifically but they really latched onto it. "
"Wow, I’d never exactly put my finger on this before. This has happened to me so many times and it’s almost always men doing it. It’s like they’re constantly assuming you must have overreacted."
"I have battled this one with relative success, but your mileage may vary.

The key for my guy was that he didn't feel confident. On a lot of fronts. He didn't feel like he could accurately gauge my interest. He didn't feel like his advances would be noticed/received. He didn't know what to do. He didn't necessarily recognise his own desire, either.

He's great once things get going but it felt like it was really difficult to get to that point, and like he wasn't picking up on any of my advances either (including some extremely overt ones. No subtlety at all)

The big raw conversation came when I was upset and frustrated and feeling perpetually rejected, and was trying to understand why. He said he didn't know how to do it right and we started unpacking it from there.

It's taken time, practice, lots more talking and things are now at a really good point. I gave him instructions on things to say and do, told him some things I do for him to watch out for, talked about how to say no kindly and reassuringly - all sorts of real, practical stuff, taking the guesswork out of it for him.

 We also talked about feelings and he's been seeing a great counsellor as a result. He's working so hard at understanding himself better and he's happier and more relaxed and I'm so so proud of him."

"Bride started out by thrusting her dry cleaning into my face. We got ready to go out in the hotel room. It was myself, the MOH, and the bride. She gave us a list of approved topics for the evening (sports were not on the list. The MOH works for a MLB team). We then walked around the city, had dinner, went back to the hotel room for HGTV and drinks.  The next day the three of us went to brunch, got our nails done, took a nap. Then three of the groom's childhood friends (all ladies) joined us for dinner, clubbing and a burlesque show. The burlesque show was actually amazing. The rest of the group got trashed at the club then proceed to puke up pink drink and beans from dinner all over the hotel room. I was the only one not trashed. The next morning the bride threw a fit over having to go to brunch with her mother and MIL, knocked over 8 wine glasses and passed out in the booth next to us. Never got paid back for any of it from anyone.

The other bachelorette party everyone cried because a) their boyfriend was cheating on them b) this was their first time away from their boyfriend and they were afraid of his cheating c) everyone else was crying so why not her too."

"I’m not a stay at home mom, but my maternity leaves with both sons were difficult for me. Don’t get me wrong - I absolutely adore my children, and I am so thankful I was able to take that first three months and spend every waking and sleeping moment bonding with them - but I need adult interaction throughout the day. I am just not suited to be a stay at home mom. Some people are, and that’s great. SO and I have even dabbled with* the thought of him quitting and being a stay at home dad. I would be totally okay with that, and he’d love it. "
"I *really* internalized this growing up. So much so that for a long time I was so proud of liking football, woodworking, video games and being generally pretty strong. It took me a long time to understand that those feelings stemmed from “being masculine is the more respected thing.” Now I still like those things but have really had to sort out my feelings about them. Is it okay to be proud of being able to help move a heavy couch when the only reason people are surprised is because of your ovaries? Am I still allowed to feel like a badass or am I putting down other women with that attitude?"

"When I like the girl, just like u/UnnamedNamesake said, pretty much anything they do will be a turn on for me. These are the ones I can remember I've experienced and still find really hot whenever I see it: 
 
* When they stretch and you can see a bit of their cute bellies, major added bonus if they make a little noise while doing it. 
 
* When they look a little rough and like they just got out of bed, wearing old clothes, with messy hair and no make up, that's my favorite look. I guess it's because every time any girl was like that next to me, they were always extra cuddly, soft and warm so I guess i got conditioned to appreciate that look in association with cuddles and nuzzling and carressing. Like, literally early in the morning when they have that bed smell, it's so raw, it drives me crazy. I had one girl I had a brief crush on, where sometimes she had bad breath and somehow that turned me on like hell when she talked close to me and her warm ~~kind of smelly~~ breath hit me. Sometimes I still think about that, I always had mints on me but I never gave her any lol. Anyway, I guess having someone being comfortable like that around me, it's delicious. 
 
* Wearing big blouses/shirts and the fabric sort of drapes over their boobs. That's a very specific one. 
 
* When they have their hair up, bonus if it's a messy bun.
 
* When she gives me gentle non-sexual kisses and the tip of her nose is slightly colder than my face, hmmm it tickles me in the right places.
 
* Snuggle up to me with their soft and warm bodies. Don't even have to touch me with your hands, just being close enough to me and letting me feel your presence and warmth. But if you wanna touch, please do. 
 
* When they smile in a cute way and have those smiley eyes. 
 
* When they have dimples, I just wanna kiss them forever. Especially with cute chubby cheeks and a pointy chin I can imagine myself biting and nuzzling every once in a while.

Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of men out there who love female welders but there’s a lot of men out there who are so hancho that they can’t accept a female can do just a good a job as them. I’ve been written up before when a male started an altercation with me, I’ve been reassigned because the guys aren’t comfortable working with me, I’ve been told to not act like a little girl when I went teary eyed to my supervisor after my nail literally got ripped off and my pinky was dripping with blood.. I usually take it in strides cause I’m a better welder than half the men I work with but it still sucks just a little cause I personally feel like I always have to prove myself to men who don’t even deserve it.  Welding is worth it though. Also my worst experience was when I helped make tank cars, I’ve always hated Texas cause that’s my homestate &amp; to me the men are more sexist.

"Lmao, as if male lawyers are the most sunshiney individuals.

"This is a very minor thing compared to abortion rights under attack, personal safety and other such considerations. But I’ll toss this out there: being automatically seen as a credible solo decision maker in certain types of large purchase. 

Example: I once went to buy a car for myself, with a male friend along to offer some advice. I told the salesman at the outset that *I* would like to buy the car, and lead all discussions with him. My friend never said anything at all to the salesman. 

Yet when it came down to talking price and financing, I had to tell the salesman three times, in increasingly more direct language, to please speak to *me,* not my friend. That it was my car, my money and my decision. First two times he’d briefly apologize, then slowly swing his attention back to my friend until he was talking to my friend exclusively. I finally had to be like “dude, my friend has nothing to do with the financing of this purchase. Talk to me, or I’m outta here.”

I’ve had similar interactions in almost any sort of similar space — buying a condo, a couch, certain services. Just a semi-regular pattern of “Why don’t you go home and talk it over with your boyfriend?” or, if I actually volunteer that I want to talk it over with my partner, some joke along the lines of “oh, convince him to loosen the wallet a little, eh?” (Not verbatim but that’s the subtext.)

It’s meaningless in the grand scheme of things but utterly infuriating to me to be treated like I must be Spending A Man’s Money when in fact any large purchase I have ever made, with or without a partner, has been with my money, and mostly my decision. It’s so infantilizing. "

I worked my way up, made director of HR, then quit and moved to a different state and became an HR consultant.

"And they only mean attractive women. No one is clamoring to buy non-feminine, non-conventionally attractive women drinks.

"I dated someone for 6 years. Thought he was the one. At one point, he did tell me he was no longer in love with me (during an 8 hour car trip *to* our dream vacation). But he said he wanted to work on things. And by work on things, he meant I had to change.

Two years after that debacle, we break up because I asked him if we were ever getting married, and he said he wasn’t sure anymore. Turns out, he fell in love with a coworker and didn’t have the balls to actually break up with me. 

He could have just broken up with me when he told me he no longer loved me, but he didn’t want to break up and be alone. I was 29.

It’s been 6 years since the breakup and I went on lots of dates and learned lots of lessons but I just got married to the best person I could have hoped for. He treats me in a way that I never thought I ever needed or deserved. It’s amazing! 

Don’t settle for someone just to settle. Don’t make excuses for super shitty behavior. If being in a situation doesn’t feel right, don’t do it. Also, don’t be afraid to be alone. I had to be alone to realize that I was treated really shitty for the majority of my previous relationships.

"Technically didn’t go to a bachelorette party but the bride had hers on the same night as the groom’s bachelor party so we all met up after. It turns out the one of the bridesmaids couldn’t afford some of the dinner items (sushi rolls) at a nice restaurant so she cried and left the bachelorette party to go to her brother’s bachelor party. The bachelor party had to stop everything to pick her up at the hotel so she could come with us to the strip club. After the club we met the bachelorette party at the Airbnb and all hell broke loose. One of the bridesmaids found out her husband got a lap dance and threw a full bottle at him then proceeded to go ape on him and punch him in the head. She screamed that she could find a man with a bigger dick who made more money than him. She said his life was over and she was taking away his kids. Then the groom’s sister and bride’s cousin start fighting over nothing which then escalated into a full fist fight between them. One of the groomsmen stepped between them to stop the fight but got knocked back and hit his head on the porch column outside. His head bursts open and blood gushes out like the elevator scene from The Shining. Then the bride’s cousin punched the groom’s sister and gave her a black eye. The paramedics were called in but the injured groomsman refused to have his head gash cleaned or stitched so now he’s walking around like the Massive Head-wound Harry from SNL (even had an open head-wound for the wedding). The worst part was the bride was asleep for all of this because she pre-gamed so she woke up to people yelling and a crime scene full of blood. She called that night the worst disaster of her life. Luckily, no one fought at the wedding though. 

Edit: Forgot to mention the bridesmaid threw her wedding ring at the husband and they both came back in the morning to find it with no luck. "
"My own. Both of my own, actually. The first one I had the flu and we couldn’t reschedule our hotel reservations. Two of my bridesmaids were pissed beyond belief that I couldn’t drive them to the hotel (again, had the fucking flu) and then abandoned me there. My husband had to drive 2 hours to come get me.

Second one, my maid of honor threw me a “do-over” party for just the two of us. It ended up being me following her around all night while she ignored me and threw herself at every guy in the bar, and then ended with ME having to take care of HER because she got too wasted. I barely had 3 drinks.

"I was with my husband for 6.5 years, married for 6 months.  When he told me he was leaving me for another woman, it really blindsided me.  I had a rough couple days, but a friend picked out some pictures of me and encouraged me to make an online dating profile.  I was really surprised how many men wanted to talk to me.  I've always had trouble meeting people.  It certainly helped out my self esteem.  After I started meeting people, I realized a lot of little things I'd been lacking with my husband.  He never wanted physical contact at all, and I found that was something I really needed.  Also I felt like we hadn't really talked in years, and we'd just been in a rut of comfort.  Being single was awesome.  I had my share of creepers that I didn't want to meet, but I generally had a couple dates a week.  I preferred to meet up with them quickly instead of texting for too long because I don't think you can really get a feel for someone without meeting them.  Most didn't pan out, but I had fun meeting people and eating new foods or trying new activities with them.  I've made a couple friends that I'm still in contact with.  6 months later, I started seeing my current boyfriend.  We've been together for 8 months now, and I'm much happier than when I was with my husband.  I don't blame my ex for leaving, I'm sure we're both doing better.  I'm a little salty about him having someone else to leave for.  It was something that should have been done long before (certainly before the wedding)."

Strangest, can't really remember I guess other than the infamous threads like ""what do you think of guys eating muffins"". Worst is a lot of pot-stirring, woman-hating, agenda crap that gets removed for obvious reasons."
"I don't see why it matters, and I can't imagine that I would ask them why. They don't like me enough to date me. That's fine. That's normal. I don't like most people in that way either. That's the default. It's not that there's something wrong with most people, it's that they're just regular people and I'm not interested in them. Same thing if someone rejects me."

Women are your allies not your enemy
The church I grew up in wouldn't accept women teachers as church members because it meant they had authority over boys. Biblical literalism and sexism go hand in hand. 
I find people kind of disregard my personal space a lot more than they do with men. I'm not 100% that other women have this experience but it just feels like people are very comfortable pushing me around and intruding on my space (women and men). My boyfriend doesn't have this experience. 
"First, this is my fave question I've seen yet on Reddit. You're right, everyone talks about SO's and relationship shit and society thinks being single and loving yourself as such is sad, which is a load of bull. I say this as a person who has never been in and doesn't want a relationship. You have no idea how happy this question makes me.

I had my ""realization"" in maybe the past year or two? I've come to think I'm a pretty damn strong woman. I made it through my shitty childhood that was nothing but severe social anxiety and loneliness. I made it through my horrible teen years that were loaded with intense suicidal feelings and, at one point, general anxiety to the point that I lost touch with reality. When I was 13, I didn't think I would make it to 16. Then I didn't think I would make it to 18. And now here I am at 20 years old, with my first job I got in February \(even if it sucks\), a completed high school education I didn't think I would ever achieve, and I'm starting college in August.

My life is nowhere near perfect, and I still struggle sometimes, but this part of my life so far, being an adult, is definitely the best yet. I can go longer without suicidal thoughts, and I wake up on my days off happy and excited.

When I do get really down, I decide to just get up. Take another step. Keep breathing. I always have something to look forward to, even if it's just the food I'm planning to eat for lunch. I have goals for the future, the biggest one being having my dream car, and I want to live to see them happen.

Life is a ride. I'm just going to keep cruising and driving as long as I can take it."

The hardest part of this (imo) is that you start second-guessing yourself. If you have insecurities about your own body, they grow and fester.

*Is she still attracted to me?*
*Does she still like me?*
*Am I bothering her?*

&amp;nbsp;

You start feeling unwanted. 
You start getting jealous, and sometimes wonder if she’s ”getting it” somewhere else.

It doesn’t matter how much she tells you she loves you, when she shows no signs of sexual attraction.

It’s very frustrating. Honestly, it hurts."
"That’s so true. Once I was in the subway and a man was staring directly at me for a long period of time(he was about 25 and I was 16). I was scared so I got up of my chair. I went in front of a door while the train was still moving. When the train stopped and the doors opened, I didn’t move but he got out and came in front of me. He was telling me to get out of the train and stayed until the doors closed again. 

When I came home, I told this story to my boyfriend at the time and he didn’t believe me. He laughed and said that the man was probably not even looking at me and that I imagined everything. According to him, I was scared for nothing and these things only happen in movies. "

"Went down to Las Vegas with my sister\-in\-law and her friends for her bachelorette party. They had all been close since elementary school, and the friends were real life mean girls. I had never and to this day have still not met a worse group of women. Had absolutely no interest in getting to know me and did everything possible to make sure I did not feel included in everything we did. It went from not acknowledging me when I tried to make conversation to not informing me of the plans / reservations they had made. It was the worst 3 days ever and to this day I have no idea why she invited me to come on the trip.

&gt;History in a nutshell -- “What do women think about women?

&gt;WE ASKED A MAN”"
"The bride's closest friends rented a suite at a downtown hotel. 

I'm not keen on strippers but a beautiful mahogany god of a man came and danced for her and it was tasteful and no one got uncomfortable. The wildest it got: the bride put her palm on Mahogany God's abs -- well north of the equator --and made an ""OH MY GOD"" face because her intended's abs were nowhere near as visible.  Even my squeamish leanings (with regards to this sort of thing) were nowhere near bothered.

Then the besties got greedy and decided that if one male stripper was good, two was even better. They summoned another stripper out of the Stripper Realms and he arrived within the next couple of hours.

He was... clearly not part of anyone's A Squad. He was buck naked within 3 minutes of walking through the door and the lap dance part was just uncomfortable for everyone. The bride was in her chair and most of us standing or sitting in a loose circle around her. There were a series of close-contact moves that required him to bent over her with his knees bent and bum sticking straight out. So I and anyone across from the bride was couldn't help but stare directly into his Big Brown Eye.

I felt uncomfortable -- I didn't leave the house that evening expecting to be gazing upon a total stranger's taint --  but mostly it was that horrible vicarious embarrassment that makes me change the channel whenever someone does something foolish or awful on TV. I hung out in the kitchen area out of eye-shot for the remainder of his performance. I talked to him later as we were both outside -- I was having a smoke and he was catching a cab -- and then felt 100x worse because he seemed like a sweet guy but a bit dim."
Source them outside of America lol. Kinda serius- my bf is from my home country. I find men of other cultures more family oriented and have most of their priorities down from young. Not speaking about European men btw. I'm in NY now and it's just not for long term relationships. 
"Pissed/steaming/off her trolley. Whatever expression you'd like to use. She wasn't too drunk to stand, but definitely too drunk to walk. Clearly not in a state of mind to be making decisions."
"When things I used to like doing start feeling like chores (still a giant red flag for me).

So when I'd meet up with a friend I would no longer think 'yay friend' but 'Ok I'm meeting someone, should make sure I do my laundry, shit need to be at the bus at 19.00, I hope I can get home early, do I have anything to talk about?'. 

Also just in general not getting joy out of fun things, not being in the mood to watch a movie, read, write, because those things no longer felt rewarding but 'meh, this is ok-ish' at most. "
"Yes! ""She lowered herself onto his sex."" Uhhhh..."
"First off\-\-burlesque shows are so much fun. Secondly\-\-I will never understand women who worry that much about their boyfriend cheating. Like if you're that worried about it, you're not in a healthy relationship."
"Being heard. I mean this literally. Often, at work, I will say something multiple times at increasing volume, and be completely unheard, only to have a male coworker repeat what I said and it’s instantly responded to. I’m not talking about a suggestion or idea, I’m talking about a direct answer to a question or a question I’m asking. It’s like they can not hear the sound of my voice unless they are looking right at me. "
"Did a 10 year old boy ask that??
... we all choose to menstruate because we enjoy cramps, nausea, and not being able to go swim on our heavy days. I’d do it more often, but my body won’t let me. Darn."
Grand Theft Auto?
"Men, even normally great guys, commenting on a woman's looks like it has anything to do with them. She doesn't owe pretty or a specific look to anyone just because you would like that.

Women doing all the work during holidays/birthdays.

Women just expected to do things like thank you cards, decorating, etc. But guys getting huge praise if they do those things. Yet if I take care of revamping the lawn, roofing the house, etc no one says a damn thing even though it is a traditionally male task.

Expected to take my husband's last name. Just because it is tradition.

"
"Oh, the bad memories! My friend had one many years ago that was at a friend's house. There was a stripper and it got really nasty. Several girls were stroking his penis including my friend. A lot of us were in horrified disbelief and mostly left the room while others egged her on. Gross!
 
I went with a mellow girls weekend at a cabin. Much more my style."
"""I suggest you put you money where your mouth is, *Neil*."""

"I was invited to the bachelorette party of a college classmate. We weren't that close, but she also didn't have many friends so I went to be nice.

It turned out to be a Mary Kay ""party"" and we spent the night sitting around the dining room table in front of tiny plastic mirrors, being instructed on how to apply sample products to our faces and being pitched a sale. I at least had wine."
Yeah. Titty and ass grabbing isn’t quite blowing someone but would also be a deal breaker for me. 
"Lift heavy and do it safely!

*You will not look like Arnold.* Bodybuilders have to undergo strict diets and training programmes *at the very least* in order to look the way they do. I promise that you will not wake up and look like He-Man all of a sudden. And even if you find yourself getting too cut or too bulky for your own taste, just change your workout program.

Not into lifting? That's okay! Make a habit out of exercising or staying active. Hike, swim, walk, lift, go kayaking, dance - do whatever gets you moving and do it safely. If you have aesthetic goals that's cool too, many of us do! But the most important thing is that you stay mentally and physically healthy."
"Yeah, it sucks. I've even encountered black guys at my school who proudly state that they wouldn't date a black girl. It's just a lost cause at this point"
"Needs more alliteration. Maybe ""Daniel's Drenched Dookie-Door"" instead? I can't believe I just wrote that. "
"I organized my best friends bachelor party many years ago. There was no strip club on the agenda and we had a good night. I can't see the need to flush your morals down the toilet just to be like everyone else and cheat as being a good thing. If people wish to do that, it is not a great foundation for a lasting union."
"got pretty buzzed one night and ended up laying in bed with my boyfriend, telling each other about the sexual abuse we both dealt with as children, me from a cousin and him from his much older sister. we cried and that was the most raw moment i’ve ever had."
"The one where the bride bailed out in the middle of the party, called her fiance to drive 2 hours to pick her up and take her home, and left us bridesmaids to sleep in the hotel without her and wonder wtf had just happened. "
"I met my fiance online. He is an South Asian man, so I was very surprised that he was still interested in me. He told me that he found black women very attractive as well as others. I was so surprised because every man before him made it clear they weren't attracted to black women or they didn't want anything serious with me. It was disheartening because I truely believed that I was ugly because of my race when I was younger. I'm lucky I found someone who appreciates me for me, but to answer your question...it's just hard out there."
"I’ve always said that if he wants to see a naked chick on a pole, my boyfriend can put one in the living room and give me money because fuck giving a stranger your hard earned cash when you have tits and ass at home "
"I flat out told a guy I was no longer interested and he kept texting me, so I sent him dick pics from the internet. "
"Women get free drinks because guys want them boozed up so they can get easy sex out of them. Having people trying to drug you for cheap sex is hardly a _good_ thing.

If those guys wanted free drinks they could go to a gay biker bar. "
Gerrymandering. Some of the drawn district border lines are ridiculous 
"So much this. It's not being a nice guy to step back and ""let"" your wife plan and organize every aspect of your family, even if you are always willing to help where and when she tells you. 

I know most of the time guys feel like they are doing the right thing by stepping out of the way and saying ""let me know what you need me to do"",  but a lot of the time what we REALLY need is for someone else to figure it all out in the first place."
"I'm most thankful to the person that bought us really high quality knives. I use them the most. If you list individual knives rather than a block, each knife is about the price range for a present from one person and you end up with a better set. "
"Delivery matters, but in the end, I guess I’d take it like all criticism. I’d internalize it and do one of three things:

a) reject it
b) self-reflect and use the knowledge for “good” (either feel better about walking away or think about changing)
c) self-reflect and feel bad about myself

I dated a lot before meeting my SO. I rejected and was rejected after one or more dates. When I was still interested and the other party wasn’t, I was always curious. I would have been open to hearing their reasons. But the grain of salt was that I was in a very confident place in my life. "
"My husband is an incredible caretaker. When my Lupus has me down, he will do anything. He literally has offered to paint my nails and shave my legs for me. "
"I don't understand, was there something the guys were doing? Or did they really get caught off guard that there were strippers at a strip club?"
"Brussels sprouts! I never had them as a kid, and they're a really common tropey thing to hate. I still don't like them unless they're well prepared, but sautéed in butter with garlic? Amazing."
"It was honestly awful. And then for the Bride to start crying 🙄 her wedding was a train wreck too. 

As for Lou—she’s a sweetheart. I just felt awful that that expensive dinner was sprung on her after she’d told all of us how much she’d saved to be able to attend her best friend since childhood’s bachelorette party "
"The mods are really good about deleting, but the thinly-veiled fap questions. Especially if it’s one of those weirder fetishes so it’s like “ladies of reddit what would you do if you found a tiny man in your sock drawer lol”"
That is one of those rarely mentioned perks of long term depression. 
"I used to be an escort, then I married a dairy farmer and now I make cheese and we run the farm together. Escorting cheese probably wouldn't be very pleasant."
"I thought bleeding through a super tampon in less than two hours for two days of my period was normal was normal. 

I also thought that having period cramps so bad that I would be curled up and crying in the fetal position was normal. 

Turns out it’s not. "
That's ... that's the most American thing I've ever read.
"* For-profit correctional facilities

* Politicians receiving money from corporations.

* Being able to exempt children from vaccinations because of ""religious reasons"".

"
"Seeing these responses, I feel like I have been peeing wrong (with tampon). I just do my thing like I always do. I give a good wipe, then go my merry way. "
"It used to be a really big deal to me. I asked him about it though once and he said something along the lines of ""I'm always ready to go but a lot of the time when I initiate, you're not in the mood or it's not the right time, or you're tired etc. It's more reasonable for you to initiate when you're ready than for me to get rejected constantly."" While it's not sexy, I can't argue with that line of reasoning. "
Not the men I know.
"Was that the ""you can just simply take birth control and then you'll never have one!!!!!!!!!"" post? lol"
"Seriously. I'm an ESL teacher for employees at mostly large companies and many of my individual students (mostly older, married men) love to give me unsolicited comments about my appearance. I like to wear a lot of black and dress more modestly. This one guy I teach constantly asks me why I don't wear ""bright"" colors and how's I'd look so much more beautiful if I did, while he makes subtley creepy, smirky eye contact with me throughout the whole lesson. I know it's not a huge deal, and no guy I tell about it would ever understand why I hate it so much, but would he fucking say that if the teacher were a man? Now I feel uncomfortable every time I see him because I know that he's going to make some comment about my appearance.
Also, in my job I feel like men expect me to be nice wayyyyy more than they would of any male teacher. One guy complained that I seemed ""bored"" talking to him, when I was treating him exactly the same as I treat everyone. Was I supposed to be giggly and flirty?? I think yes, probably. Ugh I need to stop here now I'm pissing myself off.."
I especially hate this when a man tries to explain to a group of women why they're wrong and he knows more than they do. I see this often when it comes to what women want romantically/sexually.
"The two things that spring to my mind are

1. Always having to police your tone. A lot of vocal tics that are more common in women are seen are unprofessional or markers of low intelligence. (Ex: Vocal Fry, saying like a lot) The other side of that is that you worry about being seen as ""difficult to work with"" or ""b*tchy"" if you speak too loudly or straightforwardly. (Also, the amount of times that we have to be polite to men when we don't want to because we have no way of know if he'll escalate to violence.)

2. The way beauty is required of women. While both men and women face impossible beauty standards, being beautiful isn't required of men in the same way that it is of women. A guy can be ugly and still be considered a valuable member of society but if a woman isn't conventionally attractive then nothing else that she is or does seems to matter. It really messes with you when you know that your society categorizes you into either ""fuckable"" or ""worthless"""

"Statistically, there’s very few American female CEOs but any man who’s had ONE female manager or boss thinks I’m overreacting when I say how refreshing it is to see a woman in power "
"I mean, that's entirely a matter of personal preference and situational factors. Is it by choice? Obligation? (There are reasons a person may feel obligated) 

I quit my job when I became a mother. I became severely depressed. Turns out I need a job to keep myself happy. Now I am fortunate to have a job with flexible hours. Lots of mothers would love to stay home but can't. 

Is it something *you* want to do? "
"Is bleeding for a week ever normal? /s

No but seriously I actually completely stop bleeding for 24 hours in the middle of my period every time. I don't understand why but my period just stops for a day in the middle then continues."
"Men aren't expected to be sicky sweet, happy and smiling all. The. Time.

"My wife does all the appointments and pays all the bills. She is much better at keeping everything square then I am. I do all the grocery shopping and clean the kitchens and bathrooms because I dont have asthma like she does so the harsher chemicals dont bother me. I grocery shop because she hates to do it. We play to one anothers strengths, nothing sexist about it whoever excells or is physically more capabile does the job. Its worked well for 45 years."
"What I hate on literotica is how some of the stories have good premises but then the writing falls flat. For example, I want to read a story about a mermaid meeting a sailor. I find it and the first two paragraphs explain how they met, and the third to last paragraph is all about them having sex. I want to be emotionally connected first before the intercourse part, dammit!"
"This happens constantly on /r/askwomenadvice.

The woman a guy is pursuing has made it crystal clear she is not interested and the guy posts asking ""What does she REALLY mean? How can I turn this around? I know she said no but I think she means yes"". As well as general expression of distrust or suspicion in everything she tells him. I've become wary of guys who talk about ""signals"" and ""playing hard to get"". I think most of them are just ignoring the obvious."

"YES.

Also the emphasis that’s put on women enjoying stereotypically male hobbies if they want to be a “good girlfriend”. So many magazines etc recommend women get into sports and beer and video games - not because they may enjoy them, but to seem like a Cool Girl and get guys to like them.

Meanwhile hardly anybody is going to recommend a guy gets into stereotypically girly hobbies to be a good catch. Nobody is telling guys that listening to One Direction is going to make them a Cool Guy that girls will like."
 It's called the mental load and women carry the lion's share. (Lioness)

"Nothing has worked for me thus far. We really are bottom of the barrel to most men. Oh, well. At least I won't be having any children. I don't think I could deal with raising a black daughter."
Most of the male characters have the “most beautiful green eyes” and the women have “the deepest crystal blue eyes”. Every sexy dude on the planet can’t have green eyes!
"Is she from a smaller town? I hate when this happens. I’m from Toronto. You gotta make reservations for everything, yo. "
"Probably my own. The plan was to meet up for dinner at this fancy little place with good drinks then bar hop downtown from there. 

After dinner, all but my MOH and a bridesmaid bailed for other plans. The three of us ended up going to two more bars but it was a pathetic little affair, through no fault of my two friends. They tried so hard and I felt bad for them. 

I ended up redecorating the bathroom with the contents of my intestines, and went home. Just an embarrassing, cringe-inducing night. "
"6-8 months into dating, while we were watching a tv show, my partner notices that I've caused my thumb to bleed. He paused the show, immediately gets up, sighs and says ""im gonna get you a bandaid"".

I watched him get me a bandaid and got really emotional and so i start crying. He asks me ""whats wrong whats wrong?""
""I want to tell you something but I don't want to scare you""
""Okay""

I settle down but end up crying again 5 minutes later and he says 
""The future is scary, but when i think of a future with you, i don't feel scared"".

whilst balling my eyes out, i say ""i want you to look get me bandaids, and make me tea and look after me for the rest of my life""

Andddd here we are 5 years later, engaged and due to get married in a year. Yay!"
"They can age.

I remember once I read a job offer looking for a young girl (to work as a waitress), and I as a 22 yo girl asked myself if I’d be too old for that.

It seems like what is most valued in girls is youth (and even inexperience, like for example virginity is valued in women but almost something to be ashamed of when it comes to men) and looks that match that, and it’s something quite horrible in my opinion."
"Oh my God, there are so many things. The first one that comes to mind is that a lot of guys seem to struggle with the hurdle of understanding why telling women to “smile” is sexist. “But they just want you to look happy!” For who? For them? 

That’s absolutely not the biggest example, just one that popped into my head. "
"My friend lined up a Czech male stripper for my bachelorette party. He barely spoke English, came down the stairs of my house dressed as a cowboy, got fully nude (awkward), and only danced to Bon Jovi songs. I was laughing so hard, I was crying. But he remained super serious the whole time and kept trying to get us to touch his little weewee. To top it off, the bachelorette party included members of my fiancé’s family who I had not met before this occasion, including my conservative sister in law and strict Mormon aunt. It was so bad. "
Wow that sounds horrible
"I’ve had this kind of conversation a lot with my bf. Basically, men *are* afraid for their safety in sketchy situations, however the overarching fear they have is of getting jumped/mugged. 

I, on the other hand, am afraid of being *taken* and held captive in some creep’s shed, or just good old garden variety rape and murder. It’s a totally different fear. "
I feel like this is good in theory but can get really offensive really fast no matter how tactfully you explain your reason
Um WHAT? Please do tell this story
"The flip side of that is that only _attractive_ women of a certain age and racial background get that treatment. If you're outside of that narrow range you're either invisible or an object of mockery. 

Look how many guys act like hitting 30 turns you into an instant ho bag desperate for any male attention. Everyone knows the second you hit 30, all your babies are doomed to have Downs and the IQ of dishwater so you may as well buy 10 cats and a box of wine because you're worthless.

But oh being a woman makes everything so much easier. Everyone handing you everything assumes you don't work for what you have because _boobies_. "
"I Timothy 2:12

"Yyyyyyup. Drives me nuts that guys I know will immediately jump to the worst conclusions and freak the fuck out about some guy who cut them off in traffic, but if I say my coworker was making sexist comments (again), suddenly I’m “too sensitive” and need to have “thicker skin.”"

"My friend started off her party at a strip club.  I paid $20 to get in, and the DJ played a straight hour of Metallica (from radio singles to obscure live bootlegs).  I was fresh off a breakup with a guy who worshiped Kirk Hammett and forbade me from listening to anything but the three bands he played on a loop so I was already ready to leave.  During this time, I was bitten by a stripper who was very obviously on drugs.  I like a good time as much as the next stoner but she was out of control and had already nearly been decked by another female patron.  I was sitting with my legs and arms crossed in a ""I'm just here to support my friend, not participate"" pose.   The stripper decided to give me a lap dance anyway, and evidently didn't like that I wasn't playing along, so I walked out of there with a bite mark on my chest and scratches on the inside of my thigh.

Suffice to say my bachelorette party is going to consist of hot tea, Tom Hiddleston flicks, and me, myself, &amp; I burrowed under a fluffy blanket."
"I so despise the idea that someone not touching you means you should be fine. Once, as I was walking at night, a guy tried to jump me. Not even to rob me, he just literally launched himself at me from the shadows to startle me. I jumped back, and before I could even really see his face he laughed at me and ran off, saying I looked like a crazy person. 

This incident took maybe ten seconds total to unfold--but it was terrifying. I'd been thinking about how pretty the moon was. And now I was hyperaware of how small I am, how big he was and how quickly he moved, how nobody else was around, how stupid it was for me to have pepper spray on me but not already in my hand. 

And then I did feel crazy, because when a friend found me minutes later staring into a cup of tea in our campus cafe, they took my shaking hands into theirs and asked me if maybe he'd just tripped. "

"I’m a queer woman, and I’ve had men try to rope me into this kind of behavior when they find out I’m not straight. like because I’m attracted to women, I should be aggressively sexualizing them at all times. it definitely put a damper on any hope I had that they saw me as an autonomous and complex human being when I realized this meant they had also most likely spent our entire friendship evaluating my fuckability.

"I worked on a team of nearly all males planting trees and they hardly let me do anything! The minute I picked up a shovel, they’d try to take it from me. When I wouldn’t let them, they’d say they were just trying to be nice and not let a woman do the hard work. Thing is I’m perfectly capable AND willing to do all parts of the process.  "

"I think 13 year old me would be completely smitten over my boyfriend. I’m pretty sure as far as looks go my taste has always been the same, looking back at kids I had crushes on when I was in school they all look the same: dark hair, dark eyes and tanned skin. However 13 year old me would’ve wanted to be married with kids by now (I’m 24) but I don’t want marriage or kids now. "
"Dude, an instant pot. That shit is magic."
"I feel like I might get downvotes for this, but I've always thought this. I'd be crushed if I found out my (hypothetical) fiance was feeling up a stripper and would absolutely consider it cheating.

"i hate it when a dick is refered to as his 'manhood' like 'she firmly grasped his manhood and gasped!' i find it so ridiculous sounding, also, i think half the writers think women only have one lung cause they are constantly gasping! like even in normal situations..his hand brushed past her thigh as he walked past \*GASP\*, she bends over to pic a flower, a sudden rush of wind lifts her skirt \*GASP\* like bitch wtf carm the shit down jesus"
How drunk was this girl?
"My muslim friend just got married and her hen party (and wedding) were great. She invited her closest friends and we all had a sleepover party with board games, junk food, movies, quizzes, henna, manicures, they even hired a massage lady. It was super fun and perfect for her - and mega cheap too."
"There was only one of them who was a genuine shithead and she's no longer my friend. I was so sad to hear about the death, the person who died I'd lost touch with but he was always one of those people who you don't see for a long time and then you meet up and it's like you were hanging out last weekend, and the way she said it was just *Oh hey you remember that guy you used to hang out with? Yeah, he drowned just after Christmas trying to rescue some kid who fell off a boat, so sad. He didn't even save the kid what a waste. I always thought you two were hooking up, were you?* 

My divorced friend is doing really well, she's really happy now but she couldn't face coming to the wedding. And my other friend's dad didn't die, he's in very poor health and is in a wheelchair but he's still around. I missed her wedding later that year because I'd had my baby a few days earlier, she was a bit pissed at me for not planning better. I mean, shit happens, and I enjoy the absolute ridiculousness of the whole story. It was just that all the shit was coming out in the space of maybe an hour, not that it all happened that day but that's when we found out about it all."
"I've gotten close, but things always sort of crash and burn. I'm a mid twenties female in the midwest, pursuing my graduate degree. I've dated mostly white men (not by choice) which can be problematic. I'm on every app there is, and its a lot of swiping without results &amp; seeing the same salmon shorts - fish pic midwestern guys that are generally uninterested in black women. There's also the black guys who are either ""on my level"" but somehow feel that means they have transcended black women, or the black guys who are trying to smash &amp; dash. I don't mean to make generalizations, that's just been my experience.

Of the apps, I've had two serious relationships, both of which ended with them ""just not feeling it"" after a year or so. I partly feel that that's the time frame where someone realizes that if we get serious they have to deal with all the things that come with dating outside of your race, and they become overwhelmed and uninterested. 

So, to answer your question, I would say the apps, but its a lot of effort for not much reward, and even still you may find yourself invested only to have your time wasted. Wish I had a more uplifting answer. "

Absolutely. Same here. Bachelor / bachelorette parties aren’t a last horrah when you’re already fucking committed to the point of engagement. 
"13 year old me had a crush on my significant other! It took us till we were 21, but we finally got together- I honestly never thought he felt the same about me. It's been 5 years and somedays I still can't believe it actually happened, and yet, I STILL have a crush on him!"
"Taking something I say, disagreeing with me (!), rewording it, and presenting it as their own statement. It goes something like this:

Me: The sky is blue.

Dude: No, actually the sky is the color on the rainbow between green and purple. A blue tone. 


I work in STEM and it's so common. One of my coworkers got so frustrated one day she announced she needed a microphone called A Man Repeating Our Ideas As His Own. Thank god I have moved to a different lab with a woman Pi who is a badass in her own right and has never made me feel like this once. "
"Not vaccinating your child for religious or philosophical reasons. 

It’s stupid to allow schools, doctors and other essential services to discriminate against unvaccinated kids, but to also allow their parents to basically neglect their medical needs. We’re literally punishing kids for things their parents have done. "
"Maybe 1-2 months into dating we were going at it in the bedroom and I freaked out, screaming and pushing him away from me. He went and slept on the couch, confused and hurt. I’d had a flashback to when I was raped, which doesn’t occur often, but when it does it’s painful and obviously scary for both people. I left the next morning with no explanation, sad and embarrassed. I knew I had to explain myself but it’s not always something people readily understand, and I thought I’d scare him away. 

I came back to his place that night. He opened the door for me and still seemed concerned but neither upset nor angry. We sat down on the couch together and I just let it all out. Everything -  the rape, the PTSD, the flashbacks, the feelings of guilt and embarrassment. A lot to unload on someone you basically just started dating. I cried. He never interrupted, never questioned me, just put his arm around me and held me close. All he said was “I understand.”  I’d never felt more safe or free. It’s been over a year now and I haven’t had another flashback, and only a few intrusive thoughts. I got choked up just writing this. 

Edit to add something lighter: he also really loves putting sunless tanner on my back and is very good at it!"
"I think that the difference is that as long as a guy doesn't look like he just got out of the local sewer, nobody looks twice. The bar is a lot lower for men, even if people view both genders positively when they dress nicely.

I wear a ratty T-shirt, dad-jeans, and the nastiest Asics I can find on 95% of days, and no one cares. Meanwhile, the female version of me would get judged heavily for doing so."

"Really depends. Like, if they thought I was selfish, I'd be super upset by it. If they thought I pushed too hard on my opinions, or weren't attracted to short brunettes, or didn't wanna be with someone introverted, or didn't want kids and knew I did, or knew they wanted to raise their kids Christian and knew I'd never, it'd be like ""oh, clearly we are a bad match and he would not have made me happy either."" "
"&gt; I went with a mellow girls weekend at a cabin. Much more my style.

Same(ish). I didn't even want a bachelorette, because my husband and I had been together for freaking forever and I just wanted to get married and not have all that business, but my best friend insisted, and promised it would be low-key. And it was. Me and six or seven other women went downtown wearing nice dresses and had fancy cocktails at an upscale bar, then went to our favorite dive bar for fried mushrooms and cheap drinks, and she made little treat bags for everyone like you got at elementary school parties. We were back at her house by 11. It was awesome."
"Something you'd never buy for yourself. I registered a really nice wicker picnic basket on a whim. I liked it, but I would never spend $80 on it. Someone did and I wore that thing out. I ran a home daycare and often walked my little crew to the park for lunch and pre-nap exercise. I used it for a decade before it started falling apart. So, not necessarily a picnic basket, but don't overlook the fun stuff when registering, either. "
how inconsiderate of you to give birth to a child just days before her wedding...
"For starters, take me seriously.

Sometimes I miss that relationship but then I remember how my feelings weren’t valued. They were belittled. I was “being dramatic.”

"One thing I didn't expect to be feeling (in addition to heartbreak about losing my love) is the sheer practical inconvenience of not being anyone's #1 person. 

When I have medical stuff where I need a support person, I have to ask around to see who can help me.  If I need to move something heavy, I have to ask around to see if someone can find a moment to come over. I simply don't have a default person who will *obviously* be the person I call for help.

Even my mother, who loves me and takes care of me and always comes when I ask for help - her #1 person is my father.  He was going through some medical stuff at the same time I was, and I didn't know for certain if she could help me because she'd have to prioritize helping him.  

It's an additional logistical step I have to take every single time I need another person, and it just reminds me of my  heartbreak each time."
Did you always plan to have time off for both of you to raise her? How much planning went into it beforehand?
"I feel bad for the MOH because I would 100 percent rather do that than whatever ended up happening at the beach weekend. I'm just surprised that there was that big of a disconnect between what the bride wanted and what her sister thought she wanted. I think you'd want to pick a maid of honour who knows what you want to do, but the bride should've at least humoured her. Walking out in tears seems a bit much.

Of course, that's why if I ever get married, I'm handling all that stuff myself because I'm not ending up at something I don't want to be at."
"100% this! My girlfriend thinks I’m crazy but I can just sit and watch her for hours. Her little tics and mannerisms are so cute and adorable. From the way she scrunches her nose right before she sneezes to the joyous wonder in her eyes when she’s learning something new.

As long as I find them attractive that’s all that counts, lol."

"Several times I've talked to my boyfriend (we've lived together for 4 years) and given him clear guides on when things need to be done e.g. dishes, vacuuming, sweeping, garbage, etc. Many times I'll have to ask him 2-3 times to do something before it gets done. Sometimes I'll just leave things to see how long it takes him to notice and address it. Often he doesn't notice things until I ask him or point it out, and I'll get frustrated because it happens over and over. On a few occasions his response is ""I can't always do chores on your schedule. It's like there's always something else, something more to do."" He's so great and it leaves me flabbergasted whenever he says this because...that's fucking life. There's always something that needs to get done and I'll be damned if I'm the one who's going to keep track of it all."

"12 days. A stupid but very cute boy who doesn't like me, but does like my body. "
"My answer may not be conventional. My boyfriend has a very low sex drive. He only wants to have sex about once every two weeks or so. It used to make me feel terrible when he would reject my advances for sex. I would feel ugly and my self esteem would plummet.

In every other respect he is the perfect partner for me. So one day I sat him down and we had a good long discussion. We listened to each other and both of us kept an open mind.

We made the decision that he would be the one to always initiate sex. I know this sounds morbid and maybe even barbaric to some, but it actually works for us. He knows that my sex drive is higher and he is aware of the fact that I use toys when I feel the need to get off.

We are affectionate with each other all the time and emotional intimacy has never been a problem.

I know this wouldn't work for a lot of people, but for us it's been great. "
"Everything related to the behaviour around ""girl gamers"" is atrocious. And you have to act like it's totally okay and you don't give a shit when guys treat you like shit online, because acting any other way is even more alienating. In the moments where I've reacted calmly, but have been straightforward about pointing out the behaviour and my experiences, I've been told that this is what I should expect and that I need to ""toughen up"". 

Sure, I can deal with there being shitty people, and I can dish some of it back to them. Is it really not okay to want better, though? 

Until more guys in these communities are willing to speak up, the few who do are dismissed as white knights or whatever. It's bullshit. "

"This!   The institutional sexism around expecting women to be the primary housekeepers drives me crazy.  (This doesn’t mean guys are never expected to be neat : just that it’s worse for women)

But whenever I try to explain this to a guy, he doesn’t believe me.  

As follows:

o Nobody ever looks at a kid dressed in shorts in zero-degree weather, and says, “It’s too bad his dad didn’t dress him properly!”   

o Women are judged MUCH more harshly than men for not keeping up with the housework: by their friends , parents, in-laws, etc.  
Of course, women could say, “Who cares what people think?”   But they have it to “not care” about!

o As a result, it is hard to train a guy to pick up socks (for example) by simply leaving them on the floor.  He will likely just “not care about the mess”, because he faces fewer consequences than a woman does, for being messy.  

o Women have more of the mental labor around housework.  (See the comic above, for a better explanation of that).

"I never understood the mentality of ‘men can’t relate to women in film and therefore can’t enjoy the movie’. Like, seriously, half the population does it. It’s not that hard.

Plus there’s usually a follow up of how ridiculous it is that feminists want more women representation and that females should just be fine with only males on screen."
"I also work in a predominantly male industry. The men are introduced by their title and last name, i.e. Captain Smith.  I’m always introduced by my title and first name. I feel like it takes away from my authority and position, not to mention all the work that went into getting to where I am."

I know very little about the pros and cons of tanks from different countries, it's purely a historical/aesthetic call."
"A good example of the flip side is parenthood.  Yeah, the expectations for women may be lower when it comes to physical labor or self-defense, but if you're a mom the standards aren't low.  They're impossibly high compared to the standards for dads.   If you aren't spending ALL your free time with your child, doing arts and crafts and tutoring them, taking them to baby yoga, feeding them all home-made meals made from organic products and cleaning the whole house (regardless of whether you work outside the home too) then you are failing.  If you're a father the standard is: Are you *there* and do you occasionally interact with your child?  If the answers are ""yes"" you will be viewed as an amazing father.  But, because the standards are so low, outsiders will almost always default to the mom (perpetuating the expectation for her to do everything and potentially cutting the dad off from decisions) and may treat the father as a second-class-parent.  It sucks for everyone.   Lower expectations are great if you don't actually care about whatever the field is, but there's a steep cost if it's an area you wanted to participate in and be taken seriously. "

"I got one the summer after I graduated college; insurance would not/did not cover it. My parents and I had looked into it when I was in high school. The doctor was amazing but thought I hadn't finished growing yet and didn't want to do the surgery until I was done \(she was right, I grew another cup size\). My parents told me when I graduated that they would pay for it in full \(I believe it was around 6 or 7,000 dollars\) because it would be a long time until I could afford to do that. I am \*very\* fortunate to have parents who have the means to  do this.  


I went to that same doctor I saw five years earlier; she's absolutely incredible. She said that it is her favorite surgery to do because everyone is happy with the results and it truly does lead to a higher quality of life. My breasts look amazing; I am so happy with my chest now. After the surgery I lost around 40 pounds because I could finally run comfortably with no back, shoulder, or neck pain. I cannot ever thank my parents enough for offering to do this for me."

Bride walked in, looked around, turned and walked back out trying to hide the tears. Texted a few guests to meet her at the bar.

So you would either submit a bug-bug or a bug-not-bug.

It was confusing everyone, so a third person decided that the title of the ticket should also specify Bug or Not Bug. Leaving you with a bug-bug-bug or a bug-bug-not-bug."

"I went to one with a girl that was really nice and still is and is married to a wonderful guy and they have 3 beautiful kids. It was her friend that I didn't know, threw the bachelorette party.

It started on the west side of town and we were taking a limo downtown \(so about 15 miles\) to have dinner and do some club hopping. It was cool. We were all having fun, and there was a party bus. It was fun until the bus driver pulls over and picks up two hookers? It was uncomfortable and felt really sketchy. 

Then we get driven to a hotel on the north side of town, in a really sketchy neighborhood. The hotel had a club, we could see \(from the hotel window\) a lot of people in red going in and out of the club. So it made me nervous that we would possibly be going out through a gang area. Well, the hotel was sketchy. And then a stripper shows up. The guy is about 45\-50, short. And it was super awkward. So then once that was over, we were all left on our own to get back to our cars. A $60 cab ride home.

It ended sketchy AF and I was pissed we didn't have a ride home, about 25 miles away. This was before Uber/Lyft. I'll always ask ahead of time the plan to get home. It was an expensive night. "

Every year at Thanksgiving, it is *always* all the women, regardless of age, in the kitchen for hours, doing grocery shopping, prep work, cooking, serving, and cleaning, all day long. Meanwhile the dozen or so men hang out in the living room or outside talking about the game and joking around. 

And I think, ""Hey, that actually looks like fun family bonding! I'd like to do that! I think I'll just chill out for a bit."" And what gets me is that, one Thanksgiving, I tried to do just that (after hours of helping in the kitchen, mind), and was instantly scolded by both the women and men in the family! ""Be helpful/stop being lazy/you're being over dramatic."" Like *I* was the weird one for being bothered by the clear lack of division of labor.

"My sister's bachelorette party included the whole bridal party.... including the flower girls. We watched The Princess and the Frog and gave ourselves pedicures. I assumed there would at least be some ""so are you ready to get married"" type of conversation once the flowers girls went to bed, but nothing. Literally nothing relating to the wedding was even discussed. 

I didn't even have a bachelorette party. My sister's idea of planning one was to ask if I wanted to go get a mani/pedi with our mom. She knew I had at least a few friends (because I had to fight to even get them invited to my own wedding), but made no mention of inviting them, not even for a board game night or something else ""appropriate"" by her standards. Honestly my whole wedding was the most stress-inducing days of my life and I am so glad it's over. It's been nearly a year and I haven't even looked at the pictures or contacted the photographer to make our album. I love my husband and I love being married, but everything to do with the wedding I just want to forget.  "
"""By the way you're all paying $280"" is enough reason to bail in and of itself, even if the events up to that point had been okay. Even though I could personally afford that sudden cost pretty easily, bringing it up that way, not even asking in advance if people were okay with it, is ridiculously selfish and rude. No wonder you're no longer friends."
"Guy's perspective here, but I can say that if a guy has strong insecurities regarding his ability to perform in the bedroom (ED issues, premature ejaculation, struggles to get you off, etc), he'll often avoid sex simply because he's embarrassed about it."

We were in a limo driving around but no one was 21 and there was literally nothing we could do.

We live in a national forest with our property backing up to a hiking trail. I drive to the gym to walk on a treadmill. My husband hikes by himself whenever he choses. I had to explain to him why I don’t. 
"One of the best presents we got was a garbage can for the kitchen.
Not just any garbage can it was this nice steel and black looking one that you don’t touch w your hands. You just tap it w your feet and it opens up. I’ve been married 9 years and it still works.
It’s one of those things you don’t think to buy but when it lasts you quite a bit you realize that it’s a damn good present lol"
"Even then, if you stop having periods, you can't tell whether or not you happen to accidentally get pregnant if you're sexually active.

"I can't remember where I read it but I saw this amazing commentary that said that men had two forms of beauty, ""the boy"" and ""the man"". Whereas women are only considered beautiful if they conform to ""the girl"" standard of beauty. It really made me think about all the times I see a character that's described as a former beauty or it's said that you can see how beautiful she used to be and the character is, like, 40. "
"A girl got dress coded for wearing (admittedly clearly shorter than allowed) short shorts, and while she was in in school suspension a guy went and swapped pants with her. He wore the tiny shorts for the rest of the day and no teachers said a thing"
Yes! Why is this such a thing? If I tell you something directly.... this is me telling you. You don’t need to try to interpret that any other way. 
"I used to not believe it until I noticed I interrupted my female coworker more than my male ones. I made a ""swear jar"" for it because it's a hard habit to break. So glad she called me out. 

In my defense, I do it to anyone that isn't assertive, but since women are socialized to be less assertive I'm being sexist as a side effect. "

My solution has been to just keep talking. So far it’s produced positive results 
"I like to participate in smaller threads, and also it gives me a chance to catch up on what I've missed since the last time I was here.

The strangest was probably either ""Yesterday I wore a red shirt, and today the girl who sits next to me wore a red shirt. Does that mean she likes me?"" or ""Are you willing to date a dead man, and if not why are you so bigoted?"""
"In university currently, and most of the black women around me (including myself) have a hard time finding men of any race to date. Most of the black men prefer non-black women and the non black men don't mess with black girls at all. It doesn't bother me too much cause I'm not looking to date rn but it breaks my heart to see so many beautiful girls frustrated that they can't find anyone, especially when my non-black friends have men trying to get at them all the time "
"I have experienced this and the most obvious time was when I was waiting for family at the airport. Mind you, this is a busy international airport with loads of space to walk around. This guy had all the room in the world but walked right toward me and when I wouldn't move out of his way, he made sure to brush as closely to me as possible and as aggressively as he could get away with, so if I made a scene, it would be my fault. I was standing and waiting by the arrival kisosk, with a good 12 feet on either side of me unoccupied. And he was mad because I didn't immediately move from his predestined path. "
When tops and bottoms are sold together as a set. I need different sizes for the top and bottom. 
"&gt; moist folds

Instant soft on. "
"I think 13yr old me would be completely shocked over my wife! Mostly because I hadn’t come to terms with my sexuality back then and wasn’t fully accepting that I was a lesbian.

EDIT: though I’d like to think she’d be happy, as my wife is awesome!! Lol!"
"Calling someone you don’t/hardly know “honey,” “sweetie,” and the like. Even if they don’t mean anything by it, I find it incredibly degrading and annoying as fuck. Recently had to deal with this when I switched shifts and departments, almost lost my shit on him. "
A lot of women don't wear makeup so it's whatever. I just don't like the ones who are pretentious about it.

The pain of having to stand completely still while your parent brushes a gigantic tangle from your hair. 
"I registered at a wine store. I chose wines from $10 to $75. People could buy whatever they could afford and I knew I was getting good wine, no matter the price."
"""Here's a million dollars. No strings attached."""
"got my BA in art with a concentration in sculpture and graphic design. spent a few years as a graphic designer until one day i woke up and couldn’t take it anymore. 

spent the next few months getting certified in teaching yoga and a year later here i am. happier than ever. 

just got accepted into grad school too. i’ll be studying for my masters of yoga to eventually become a yoga therapist. "
"Same. I’ve had a terrible time dating, have moved to try to meet men. My standards are pretty low, and Men have mentioned to me “You’re so pretty, but you’re black....so...” 

It hurts. A lot. I try to meet guys who are interested in similar pursuits. My friends (not black) have been successful online, or by meeting though friends. 

I suspect that might be successful, but maybe it’s a numbers game?"
"I'll make one and update you!

EDIT: r/bolognapony/"
If asked... Wear Sunscreen. Don’t smoke. 
"Yeah, she never took any responsibility. She's actually my former SIL now so it doesn't matter anyway, haha. "
"That’s pretty much how I feel about it too and I know I get streams of endless shit—talking from my husband’s friends for it. He said no to going to a strip club for one of their bachelor parties and somehow that’s a “whipped” thing to do. I didn’t even tell him he couldn’t, just that I didn’t want to know one word of what happened if he went. He chose not to🤷🏻‍♀️"
"I listened to a [Ted Talk](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ted-radio-hour/id523121474?mt=2&amp;i=1000404476205) yesterday about how girls are raised to aspire towards perfectionism, leading them not to take risks and make mistakes.  I see this all the time on playgrounds where my son and the other boys are allowed to engage in riskier behavior while the girls are told frequently to stop doing something or to be careful.  My parents were the same with me compared to my brothers.  The Ted Talk mentioned a Computer Science camp where the girls were sitting in front of blank screens and the teachers thought they weren’t doing anything at all.  But then when a teacher hit undo, it turned out they had written a lot of code and then erased it all due to one mistake.  Another study showed that women only apply to jobs if they meet 100% of the job requirements, whereas men will apply to a job if they meet 60%."
I let them know from the beginning that I'm looking for marriage. It worked been married for 7 years this past may.
"You vent, we listen.  You are not alone."
"I’m still on this journey, but I just wanted to say I LOVE this question, thanks for asking it, and I can’t wait for other’s responses &lt;3"
"I started reading your last paragraph thinking “oh yes, I like to online shop and redecorate rooms when I’m drunk too!”... and then I finished the sentence hahaha"
"Agreed. That’s why I’m curious how it’s gone for other women. I have a 6 figure job and work from
home so this is a VERY hard job to walk away from. At the same time, I’m having our second child soon and part of my heart is telling me to experience the SAHM life. 

But, if I leave this job, the chance of me finding something similar if I wind up unhappy is quite low. 

However, when I look back on my life, will I regret making the decision to work and miss part of my kids’ childhoods?

I’m the type of person who likes to hear a lot of perspectives because it helps me make my own opinions and choices, so I’m hoping to hear from a few people!"
I’ve always liked how The men on Brooklyn 99 were portrayed. 
"That's when you walk out. Even if they won't listen to your words, they'll definitely notice your money walking out the door.

I went to fifteen car lots (by myself), ready to buy a vehicle that very day (for cash) before i found a salesman who treated me like a serious buyer, didn't bullshit me, ignore me, or try to pressure me into something other than the makes, models and years i specifically asked about. Not only did i buy a Matrix from that guy, I also regularly refer new customers to him. Every time they buy from him he sends me a hundred bucks as a thank you. "
"Women as plot devices. I swear to God I am so tired of the badass cool girl, who in many ways is more talented, badass, or qualified than the hero playing second fiddle to an average white guy. Or worse, her sole purpose being to die so he realizes his destiny."
"This is so good I’m saving this! I’m a single mother and I’ve tried to explain to people so many times that the most exhausting thing is not doing all things, but just keeping track of all the things. But people don’t get it.

I had a boyfriend who would say ‘but you’re not that busy, you have time to sit and watch netflix in the evenings’. Like yes, eventually I have to stop for the day and sit down, but half the time when I’m watching tv I’m also thinking about what I need to do tomorrow, and what we’ll have for dinner the next few days and making grocery lists.  There’s enough to do that I’m never ever ‘done’ and that is exhausting."
"This sounds like the marriage version of “Why do you want McDonald’s, there’s food at home”"
"&gt;For semi modern times, the Scorpion because it's cute.

Yes! The Scorpion is one of my own favourites too. There's something very endearing about its diminutive frame and stubby little 76mm gun. "
Technically aunts but Hilda and Zelda from Sabrina the teenage witch (tv show). They were supportive of her and very understanding of her problems. You could tell that they really cared about her and loved her unconditionally. The magic is a total bonus. 
"I’ve been best friends with my husband since we were nine. We’ve been married for a decade this summer. We had our first child in August. There have been floods and deserts in this time, including now as I am still recovering from a fucked up birth. We are the happiest couple you could meet and basically always have been.

Even when there is no sex, there has never been a day without best friendship, hugs and kisses, squeezing hands, understanding nods, laughing spells, stolen smiles, and frequent and genuine expressions of love and admiration. I don’t understand why this one thing is considered the most critical thing; like all other key parts of a relationship, communication and compassion keep you on the same page and alert you if you aren’t and need to do some problem solving."

"And she wasn't even a super ""boring"" or conservative girl. It was surprising to me. Not that she needed to be out dancing on a bar somewhere, but even just a girl's happy hour or something. Something past two in the afternoon at least...I had to wear a ""bridesmaid"" sash throughout the mall. "
"Because I want my answer to actually be read. 

Nothing too weird, yet, but I love the ""Why did my ex girlfriend do or feel this really specific thing in response to this really specific situation?"" questions. WHY FEMALE HIVEMIND?? YOU MUST KNOW. "
"I don't send out hints, as my hints never work.

 One word responses? He'll just keep texting because I'm texting him back.

If I'm not asking questions, he starts asking questions.

If I'm not helping move the conversation along, he changes the subject.

I'm just straightforward now and tell them I have to go, then I either ghost, or I end up telling him later on that I'm not interested.

Context is key here, though, like am I just bored of this particular conversation? Did we go on a date? Who is he? How well do I know him? Do I want to keep in contact with him at a later date?"
"\&gt; So when I'd meet up with a friend I would no longer think 'yay friend' but 'Ok I'm meeting someone, should make sure I do my laundry, shit need to be at the bus at 19.00, I hope I can get home early, do I have anything to talk about?'.

That's how I feel, constantly. I didn't realize it was an issue. I have diagnosed depression but never correlated the two. I never found joy in spending time with people. Out of the thousands of people I must have met in my entire life, I only feel relaxed with my spouse. Everyone else feels like a chore, or a task I need to complete."
"That's because a lot of the men who hold those views don't even see ""ugly"" women as women, they see them as creatures who deserve hate (in my experience) "
"That last part, um, it happens. Very very rarely, but it can, for some women. Especially if there's been a lot of psychological build up and so forth. I'm definitely no sex guru or anything special, but I've seen it a time or two (literally, 1 or 2 times) in my 20 years of activity. That said, it is in general pretty unrealistic and I would imagine it's annoying in literotica especially considering the difficulty many woman have reaching orgasm."
"You can walk into a club without worrying someone spikes your beer.
You don’t cross the road and make a wolverine claw with your keys just in case that suspicious looking dude tries to rape or assault you.
Your jeans have usable pockets.
If you try to buy a car, they won’t assume you’re clueless. Whenever I went to a car dealership to look around, they showed me „pretty“ cars, not good cars.
You’re taken more seriously in your job. No one will think you’re sleeping with the boss so you get a better position.
Men‘s hygiene products are cheaper and often better. Like, women’s razors are mostly bullshit but expensive because of gel pads and being pink.
You can basically roll out of bed in the morning and go without getting weird looks, since you’re not expected to always look pretty."
"I go for the low hanging fruit. The men I go for are lonely, depressed, and just want to be loved. Also I only go for white guys. Also, I'm sorry, but the statistics aren't pretty, I'm going to have much better luck at life with a white guy than a black guy. "
"Whenever the story is obviously male-centered. For instance, measurement sizes, quickly getting to the PIV sex, talking about how she screamed and instantly orgasmed from PIV, slightly degrading towards the female, etc. It all just immediately turns me off and honestly pisses me off."
“Hi I’m Jade d-cup Blackrain and this is my always inexplicably in a leather jacket love interest Axel 9-inches-ladies Nightwood” 
Literally anything. Alcohol isn't a requirement for fun
All sexy dudes also smell like sandalwood???
"Aaaah yes, ye olde 'she breasted boobily down the stairs'. Aside from high school fanfiction writers for whom everything is wardrobe and appearance, no one ever sits there obsessing over their bodies like that during everyday life."
"1. I'm still happily married to my husband who is also happily married (to me)
2. I'm a mother who hasn't drowned or smothered her child(ren), or turned to alcohol to cope
3. I'm selling a lot of cheese and living my best life"
"The expectation that I'm supposed to smile and be receptive all the time. No. I have a default serious face and demeanor and I don't have to act all soft and squishy for anyone. I'm nobody's Stepford. 

""You'd be prettier if you smiled more."" (That seems to be popular down here in the South.)

No, I look just fine as I am, and *you'd sound a lot better with your mouth closed.*

And....

When it comes to men asking for advice on typically men things, I can get ignored and dismissed. A guy was asking for boxing tips on another sub, and I replied with some recommendations. He replied to another commenter and deliberately ran around my reply but included in his response to the other person that he appreciated *his* response wasn't from a 40 year old house mom.... which *I am. * Never mind I have years of boxing experience on the guy. Ok, dude."

I’m 38 and this past year has been the best so far. Working my dream job. Won a design award. Making great money. Debt free. Have an incredible SO who is amazing in all respects. Lots of travel and freedom to enjoy hobbies with friends. In great shape and feel like I’m living my best life.
One time I saw it called “flaps.” Never again. 
"&gt;It was ALWAYS just assumed that I was the one taking notes.

I fucking hate that. I've witnessed that since college, when we had to work in groups. That dynamic has just transferred into the office 20 years later (I'm in my late 30s)."
At least guest one seems nice and normal....
"She would be like: ""Oh geez, eeeew!!! He got *hair* on his *chest*"" x.x

Let's just say I grew up since then.. "
"I feel like some older men are totally, absolutely oblivious to how and why we are fearful, like the professor here. I think other older men are able to see more eye to eye, either because they’ve heard anecdotes from wives/daughters/friends, or because their own perceived masculinity has been decreased with age"
Men disregarding my firsthand experiences when I tell them about them.
"They why is so I can get questions right when they come up for answering/modding reasons.

The strangest/worst is all a big mass of terribleness that comes in as white noise at this point.  The obvious troll ones are the most hateful, but I would say the ""Here is a mundane thing, does it turn you on?"" ones."
"I find it gets used a lot in historical literotica, when they don't want to use modern slang but don't know what else to use."
"My favourite is ""ringing the devil's doorbell"" for lady masturbation. "
That’s not true. I love being a black woman and I have a lot of fun!
