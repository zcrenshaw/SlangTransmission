I lived in Philly when the Phillies won the World Series and it was super fun. Strangers high fiving and hugging. Lots of cheers. There were definitely people getting rowdy but it never felt dangerous and I was on Broad street which is the main hub for celebration. Yes there are a few assholes who do dumb shit but overall it’s a really fun/cool experience that is generally super good vibes. The city is def not “destroyed” afterwards. My office was downtown and it was a little messy but nothing crazy. 
"Had a roommate that shit in her pants and hid her dirty drawers in her dresser.  She also walked funny, I asked her why she walked that way and she told me, “I don’t want to step on my tail”.  I was in the psych ward for an eval.  I was def not the craziest person in the room. "
"Whenever the question here is about calling someone out, its def r/askreddit"
