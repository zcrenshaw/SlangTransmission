"The **most** important aspect of being a blended family is the way you treat the kids. This is **bullshit**. 

My daughter isn't my partner's bio-child, but nobody can actually tell, he treats her *exactly* like he treats his other daughter, his other daughter that I bend over backwards for to show her that I love her exactly like I love my own little beast.

Don't let your daughter grow up with a father figure who doesn't love her fearlessly, unconditionally, and **exactly like his own**."
"Hey! Your husband is an awesome guy, but I'd love to have more one on one time with you, how do you feel about that?"
"Yeah, OP it irks me slightly that you’ve said ‘conveniently there’s no one that speaks her language here’ as if it’s a purposeful move from your wife, I think this could be negotiated. "
Yeah it sounds like he wants all of that done but not by him. He probably wanted to be the distant fun dad who steps up when they're older/more interesting but is upset his wife has that role. 
"Yep.  Can't imagine staying with someone when they've so clearly shown you what a terrible partner they are.  

OP, this guy did you a favor by announcing how awful he is.  Now it's your turn to do what needs to be done."
"You're 21, been cheated on once already in your short relationship and she's telling you ahead of time she's going to put herself in a position to do it again.


When are you going to get a little self respect, OP?"
"Honestly, maybe she could use some therapy. My student loan debt is manageable, but even so there were times early on when I had a ""I'd rather not even consider what it really is"" avoidant attitude towards it. I didn't lie to anyone about it, but I could see it coming to that if the anxiety over the debt was out of control. If she has something absurd like 300k-400k in debt that would be a very tough thing to come to terms with. A lot of guilt, anger, and shame when you're handling something like that. 

Luckily that kind of debt should only happen for someone going to med school, or maybe an expensive law school. Do you know everything about what paths she tried in school?"
lmao basically 
It sounds like he was keeping her on hold in case he found someone he liked better. He was being sleazy.
"As a bi woman, this has happened to me a lot. As soon as you say you are bi at a party some pretending-to-be-drunk-so-they-have-an-excuse chick gets all aggressively flirty. "
"Consider crate training so the dog has a place of his own? A lot of dogs love having a space that's theirs, and it can help them self-soothe their anxiety. You could even toss in a blanket that smells like you if you're that concerned about separation anxiety!"
"That or bacterial vaginosis, which is also treated with metro. BV is probably less likely to create follow up questions."
"Parents have power, and however right he may be, they can still ban him from their home. So, tread carefully because they actually do need to be appeased. "
"But this isn't some Big Thing, there's no need to make it one. Text is fine - this is a super normal, casual, reasonable request to make. It doesn't require a conversation, really. Why would you need to say it to her face?"
[removed]
"Aww, congratulations on your puppy!! :D

Also, I maybe kinda checked your post history hoping for puppy pics and I was not disappointed. :D A corgi is the kind of dog I'm thinking I want to get one day, when we're in a better spot to do so.

Congrats on your health doing better and on your sweet new addition!! :D"
"As a young, good looking, female attorney I can tell you this isn't sufficient to disbar anyone. I'd be lying if I said I don't have a list of misogynistic old shits whose death I will celebrate.

Do report them though. If it was court ordered mediation it may get them off the list of approved mediators."
I ended our relationship. We both ended our on/off friends with benefits thing a couple times each. 
"It doesn't just tread close to extortion, it tramples all over it. 

This *is* extortion, flat-out. 

""Pay or I'll sue"" is okay. ""Pay or I'll go to the police"" is not. Police are not there to provide legal aid in repairing damages, they're there to police crimes. A lot of people conflate lawsuits and criminal charges because they both involve a court room, but they're not the same thing at all."
"If you're 40, pursuing 28 year-olds, and have minimal relationship experience, youd better believe I see a ton of warning signs. 

That's not to say that person is a bad person. But...I'm going to have questions. And I am going to pay super close attention to every answer, gesture, and tone. 

I wouldn't hire a kid with high-school experience to be my business partner. And I wouldnt trust a 40 year old with no relationship experience and possible maturity issues to be my life partner. "
"DO NOT do couple's therapy with abusers. He will more than likely only use what is said in session as ammo outside of session. She should, however, do individual therapy."
"then he needs to go to rehab.  There's nothing you can do to help him right now beyond that.  Anything else is enabling, and will only make things worse."
We share 100% so it's tricky. I wonder what she is going to say if I later buy my parents a $4k cruise vacation when we're trying to save enough for our house. I actually want to do that and dare her to say that I can't spend that money. It's the exact same situation. 
"And what does your wife think of how you ""dick around"" with this coworker? "
"&gt;The jewelry isn’t a huge deal in the big scheme of things. But I’m worried there’s some sort of underlying resentment building.

Oh yeah. This is resentment bait for sure. Your fiance probably has some insecurities about his own financial situation and is taking it out on your father. Also, he went to your mom because he knew she would agree with him. That's not cool. He shouldn't be playing your family or trying to manipulate your relationships with them."
"because it prevents him from reaching rock bottom.  he needs to hit that point before he can truly get clean.  by making aspects of his life easier, you're prolonging his fall.  He's still doing drugs, correct?  He's not stopping because of the work you're doing.  "
"You need to get out of your own head a little. He didn't do this to make you feel terrible, and trying to talk only about that isn't going to get you anywhere. You feel awful because of what he did, and that's completely valid. It sucks that's you're dealing with this. But if you want an answer, you're not going to get it by focusing on you. You're getting good advice. Listen."
"So.........she's a Christian who does what she wants, regardless of Biblical precedence, because it's her failing as a human?

That's not devout, that's just cherry-picking. I find it very difficult to respect people who claim to be extremely devout except when it inconveniences them or they don't like it.

My guess is there are a lot of these little things. Your SO probably isn't as devout as she claims. 
"
"Asks for help. Doesn't want help. 
NEXT! "
"It doesn’t cancel those out it just renders them “not enough”. 

I’m a recovered addict (6.5 years sober) and I’m married to a recovered addict. He’s the most amazing man I’ve ever known and we have a beautiful life together. If I found out he was doing blow again - even IF everything else seemed normal - he would have to move out until he got help and got some solid clean time again. Addiction is a cunning disease and it will ruin the addict and everyone around them. 

You say he’s a model citizen, but that’s a front. Cocaine is so important to him that he hid it from you to “protect” his habit. He’s gone in to debt for cocaine, he’s risked his job, and his relationship for cocaine. Right now cocaine is his number one and until that changes you can’t have a healthy happy relationship with him. He’s not a piece of shit, he’s a sick man in the grips of a debilitating disease who currently doesn’t want to seek treatment. 


My suggestion would be to talk to him directly and clearly about what you know. It’s likely he can access rehab through his HR department. Figured out what you need to see him take action on and stick to your guns."
Isn't the word 'ex' distinguishing enough? Why do you feel the need to add the descriptive word 'current' to talk about your husband? 
"You might also warn her that she's in danger of running afoul of the laws on hate speech, depending what she posts. She doesn't have the same protection some of the TERFs she's following do, if they're from the US and she's here in the UK."
"Jesus, do you really want to stay in a relationship where you need to put yourself down so he can feel like a ""man""? That sounds exhausting as hell."
Don’t assume he’s smarter than you. 
"I agree with you but I'll say that I am deliberately being harsh.  This isn't a question of a kid being a latchkey kid or not having sufficient lunches, this is a kid who is involved with a child predator. Yes, OP has emotions about her friend and I understand that, but her responsibility is toward that child."
Can we agree that they both suck?
Girl are you joking? Why are you still with this guy? 
"He’s in a relationship with his friend whether it’s sexual or not. If there was a movie about their relationship, you’re the placeholder girlfriend that the guy has to break up with to see all he needed was right in front of him all along.

He doesn’t respect you and prioritizes her needs over yours. He brought her on his vacation to see you and she slept in your room. That’s insanely disrespectful. What excuse could he possibly have had for doing that?! 

Don’t allow yourself to be treated this way. Save yourself heartache and **breakup with him.** You don’t deserve than him. Do NOT move to be closer to him."
"Your kindness is listening is what a friend would do. Another thing you could do is if she broaches the subject of her memory, ask her what her doctor says about it. Her response will probably include whatever the next step might be — be it encouraging her to go to the dr, follow his/her advice, etc. "
"Some people are just cryers! I recently started crying over an episode of queer eye. I mean come on. It's queer eye, HOW did that make me cry?? Crying for an extended period at the memory of a recently deceased dog seems pretty natural to me. I can also imagine how much more upset op would be at her boyfriend's lack of support. "
"ah yes, the good old 'bi men are actually gay, bi women are actually straight' rethoric. yikes."
"You don't need to openly accuse him yet. What you DO need to do is go to the hospital/police station/women's shelter and get a rape kit. Place the underwear in a ziploc bag, take photos of your body  (bruises, scratches, possibly your genitals if there is any bruising or pain), collect the sheets, and go to the hospital. Once they determine what happened, you can place the police report and tell your husband. Even if you aren't sure exactly what happened, it is for your peace of mind and personal safety to get this checked out. Good luck! We are here if you need support. &lt;3 "
"I had an abusive stepmom and a dad that did nothing. Every day he stayed with her, he chose her over you.

If you're saying you're going to be living under their roof for the first time since you left for college, I'm sorry, but I think that'll be a disaster, no matter how small you try to make yourself. I imagine it's probably for financial reasons, but if there are any other options, you should look into them."
"&gt;I feel so bad for potentionally fucking up my friends life over one stupid choice.

Wrong. Are you fucking a kid? No, your creepy friend is. His choice, his consequences. If you’re a mandatory reporter, it’s probably mandatory you report this. If you don’t...well, you should maybe find another job that lets you rug sweep gross and possibly illegal behaviour of friends."
"I think it's absolutely fine if this is a dealbreaker for you. It would be fine even if he were using drugs but otherwise seemed to have everything together, but he's racking up debts and he's lying to you. Frankly, walking away from this one seems like a sensible move. "
"I think it's very poor taste to use the anniversary of such a traumatic event to get back in contact with an ex. Leave it alone, you're moving away soon anyway and it was only 5 months where you didn't behave your best. Let the past be the past and move on."
"I'm not really going to keep on explaining myself to you. I can't pump because I don't own a breastpump. Since I don't go out there's no reason for me to own one. Im not dragging a newborn baby to a police station. I'm not leaving nanny here with SIX (which is not a safe ratio for one adult to watch at once) children when I know she's not going to be able to watch them all at once (or feed the baby since the milk maker will be gone!) There's too much chaos right now as there is with some being ill.

If it comes to the point where he wants a divorce over this then I will just have to do what I have to do. Since he can't stand the sight of the six children he claimed he wanted (a big family he said) then he probably wouldn't care anyway. We would go over my mother, who has many times told us if anything happened to come back home. I don't have time to look for him right now. Period. "
"I kept wondering if OP was on the spectrum. (Not sure if that's still an acceptable term these days: I have a family member who refers to himself that way, so I assume so, but could be wrong.) "
"Nope. He meant if I live with a man before I’m married, then zero other men would ever want me because I’m damaged goods. "
Agreed. The problem is not so much what the Gf believes in...but that she feels the need to loudly call members of OPs family out and shame them. 
"You're willfully missing the point. He won't put in the smallest effort to make this process or day more comfortable for her. It's not about the dress. It's about this all boiling over because she asked him to take care of an issue and AGAIN he didn't. If you read the post, you must have read that the fight was about pulling his weight with the wedding. 

Have you ever been stressed out and NO ONE is helping? If you have, haven't you ever had a small issue  that pushed you over the edge? 

It's not about the dress, it's about this guy refusing to put in any effort to help her. Yeah, this is the hill to die on because he's let these issues go on so long with no resolution."
"As others have pointed, Op mentions she never has had issues like this with MIL. So I wonder if her husband even told his mother it was supposed to be a secret or just told her and she assumed OP's parents already knew? Her not contacting Op is also kind of weird. We don't know how that conversation went. "
He’s suffering? How can someone else’s life choice that has nothing to do with him cause him suffering? He isn’t suffering. He’s upset you aren’t bending to his will. 
"You keep getting defensive about this when it's brought up.  Like, it's literally the only thing you are commenting about.  I don't think anybody here is being accusatory.  It's just a matter of fact.  When 2 people, including adults, are of different age groups and are together, there will be looks and judgments.  Whether that's right or wrong is irrelevant.  It's just a matter of fact.

People are trying to give context to why people might stare on top of the excessive PDA.  That's all."
"A lot of those probably aren't raising the grandchild as their adoptive child, with the actual parent ""sibling"" still around too, but that's still common enough (I'm guessing no one parses out stats on why the custody situation is the way it is). 

I suggest you look up similar stories to yours online (someone else mentioned Jack Nicholson right? Start there). That will give you some insight on how others have navigated similar situations. And share them with your BF. Maybe him seeing that others have been there and it all turned out great will make him come around more quickly. "
"You are going to have to discuss this all with your husband to get the story on his concerns with your plan.  We can’t tell you what he’s thinking. 

It did stand out to me that you studied for the GRE for weeks before telling your husband that you were planning to take the GRE.  To me, this indicates that either you knew he would be upset, or communication in your marriage is deeply lacking.  Which is it?"
" Husband bought me an entire set of planters for some of the black Japanese pines I'm currently growing He's been incredibly supportive of my new little adventure and even asked if he could have one of the extra sproutlings for himself.

Husband and I also recently spent an entire day watching bingeing with babish while making giant cardboard forts out of soda boxes for our pet rats cause we were worried they would get too bored.

Also, My mother-in-law is incredibly awesome, scary but awesome. I've noticed over the last week or so I've really come to admire her as a person. She's a no bullshit, tough, very independent person whose flourished in life without the assistance of anyone. She had a successful career, great son (totes biased), tons of friends. Also, she calls my pet rats her grandkids. 

Edit: Feel Free to PM for Rat pictures. :D

"Even if you hold off a couple of months, if you’re wife is pregnant by then anything can happen(bedrest, premature baby, just a very tired crappy feeling wife to name a few). The only sure way to avoid conflict with your mothers party is to wait until AFTER the party to conceive and that is just unreasonable. I can understand why you’re wife wouldn’t agree with you. Unless the party fall on the day she goes into labor, I don’t see why you couldn’t go anyways. Go with a pregnant wife, go with a baby(short stay if necessary), or go alone and wife stays home with baby. 

Edit: just realized it’s a far away state. In that case you could go alone if your wife can stay a couple of days alone. That one you’d have to plan closer to the date. "
"&gt; Should I suggest therapy?

Wow. No. Move on and work on being less judgmental of others."
Is he depressed or dealing with other mental health problems?
You should be able to communicate with your partner about things like this. Why do you feel you're having trouble talking about normal relationship things with your partner? You should have an open conversation about what things you BOTH would like to work on in order to improve your sex life.
"Thanks, I guess I needed this, a part of my anger is her trying to control me, like I'm family and she has or had any authority over me. 

On the topic of giving my dad the custody she was actually a bit shunned by the them. My uncles and grandparents wanted to became my guardians if my mom wasn't willing but dad wanted and he had more money, free time and my mom had already made it clear she didn't want me. So in that sense they are very united"
"Also, this isn’t how friendship is supposed to work"
"You're right - it may be an age thing.

The whole no black guys thing is *very* common with online dating. It really hurts when I see it and all of my friends feel the same way. So the fact that I'm currently dating someone who might have had that perspective in the past hurts me...


I want to know if she did and if so I want to explain to her why it was wrong of her. I'll probably ultimately break-up honestly - if true, even if she grew out of it, really hits hard.
"
"&gt; I have reached the lowest point of my life. I have been so depressed and I have no motivation to do anything in my life. 

Do a web search for ""drowning person kills rescuer"".

She's pulling you, the untrained rescuer, under the water and is threatening to take you down with her.  It doesn't matter if she is conscious of this or not.  

You should divorce her.  Once you have divorced her and regained your life and strength, then you might be in a better position to help her.

"
[deleted]
Dude you ARE NOT treating her as an equal. 
When you say “she should do sales!” What do you mean exactly? How do you just go do sales? I mean selling what? My boyfriend is in sales and he basically knew all the right people to get an awesome job handed to him. Everyone in his office had/has good connections. How do you get into legit sales positions with zero relationships?
"Bring us an update! 

And, she's being manipulative and childish -- She just doesn't want the toy she dropped to be played with by anyone else. "

"Also, I think if men want to have sex with women the they need to be mature enough to handle everything that goes along with it. That means don’t act grossed out by any bodily fluids that come from women. He does sound like this goes beyond that stuff. But even so, children vomit, poop, pee, spit up, get cuts, etc. Is it really realistic to expect that you’ll be the only one to tend to those things. What if something happens to you and you can’t physically care for the kids? What would he do?"
"&gt; Honestly, few high school relationship survive college anyway, no matter how intense.

On the flip side, if OP is looking for a more optimistic outlook, some of them do.  

I ended up marrying my high school sweetheart, and like OP, we were 18 and head over heels in love.  We DID go to different universities, about a 4 hour drive away from each other, before the internet, Skype, texting, free long distance calls, or any other easy way of communication other than countless of handwritten letters. 

It was tough and we took a break for about a year to find our place in our respective schools without the stress of a long distance relationship. That summer we reconnected and started dating again. The time apart provided a lot of perspective and made our relationship stronger.  We have been together 28 years and will be celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary this summer. Still very much in love.

Interestingly, our 18 year old daughter is about to head off to university this fall. She was offered a substantial scholarship and early acceptance into a very competitive program at a school about 5 hours away from home. Her boyfriend has not yet received any acceptance letters but his grades are not good enough to qualify for a scholarship, so due to financial reasons, he will probably attend a local college and stay home. If she were to tell us that she has decided to stay home and not take her scholarship to stay closer to him we will react just like OPs parents.  I mean it I love my kid and we have a great relationship. I also really like her boyfriend - he is a goofy kid with a big heart. But holy fuck, would we ever lose our shit if she decided to throw away a fantastic educational opportunity just because she is 18 and in love. 


"
"Dude, honestly, you’re STILL defending Jess in this thread so I really don’t think you do want to be in your marriage. "
"Go to premarital counselling now, don't wait til June. I will say that your girlfriend being dismissive of you and your feelings isn't a great start though."
"&gt; You probably won’t do better, it will be a lateral move at best

What?  That's quite the presumption to make.  I gotta disagree, I don't know a single person who isn't happier in their adult relationship/marriage than they were in their high school one."
If he's unwilling to communicate with you like an adult who is interested in having a healthy relationship than you have larger problems than his thoughts about your sex life
"You might not want to lose him, but don't let that pressure you into making a commitment you don't want and for which you're not ready. You need to think of yourself first.

He's going to feel a bit wounded - proposing to someone is a big deal, very personal, and a rejection is going to hurt. Be supportive, by all means, but don't waste energy constantly reassuring him. If he can't understand the reasons for your decision to say 'no', and insists on taking it as a fault with him, it probably means he's not mature enough to handle marriage anyway."
"Woah woah woah

It's obvious her religious friend said something shitty about having multiple partners, so she went to her bf to make her feel better. Sure, it was a terrible way to go about it, but it's so obvious what she really meant"
"My Welsh mother in law from farming stock (She's in her 70's) uses the phrase ""granny reared"" to describe that situation, much more common than many people would think!"
"It was a defense mechanism. It was apparent to me in your first paragraph that she had feelings for this guy, he didn’t return them, and she overstated her disinterest to hide her hurt. It’s not a healthy defense mechanism, but I don’t think she was trying to cause drama.


When it became apparent that you might start something with him, she had to face all the feelings she hasn’t processed. Pain, embarrassment, and maybe a little bit of hope that he’d change his mind. 


All you can do is take a step back and let her process it in her own way. If she feels like she pushed the two of you together without working through those feelings, it will destroy her. That’s not your fault or your responsibility, but it’s something to consider."
"Your husband is slacking and has no excuse for dumping the household management on you.

That said, you said that one of you would have to quit or else it would be long years of separation. What do you think that would have done to your relationship? There are many reasons why military divorce rates are what they are. You would have had a driven spouse... driving in a different direction.

Now you have a dependent. Part of that is a price you pay for having an international and tough career and the luxury of getting to have your partner with you instead of off being Mr Driven somewhere else. And your spouse has given up all semblance of his career to trail after you, which has to be hard on him, going from being his own guy to just being your SO. I agree he needs to pull up his bootstraps but I think you are undervaluing the fact that he fell on the sword so you didn't have to, and you have a career and he doesn't.

The fact that you have a bit of a lazy dependent might be his character, might be a sense of fatalism or depression or ""what's the point""; I've seen lots of trailing spouses and especially men who are trailing spouses really struggle with the point of their existence. Expat wives' clubs, officer's wives clubs, ladies who lunch, blah blah blah are partly because of traditional family structures (no one seems to bat an eye at the tons of military wives who are just...there... but it's not acceptable to be a dude who's just...there, you get judged by everyone and even your spouse, at least in a the cases I know) and also because having to get a new job every few years to follow a rotation basically kills any hope of a career and leaving the person with just a job.

Anyways I think you could be more empathetic, but you guys need to have some serious talks about what each of you want the future to hold. Couples' counseling at a minimum, and he should also be more responsible for the emotional labour of your lives. And if you don't want him any more, walk away and let him get on with his life instead of following you."
"the devil doesn’t need any more advocates and you don’t need to reply to a description of /rape/ with “denying sex is selfish.” this kind of attitude is why op’s boyfriend is able to guilt her into having sex when she doesn’t want to. yeah, sexual compatibility is important, but being horny isn’t a fucking medical emergency and if it’s that big of an issue then he should’ve tapped out when he realized their sex drives didn’t match, rather than fucking coercing and raping her."
Because he looks down the shirts of women.
"I'm so sorry. I hope you're doing better now. &lt;3 
Thank you-its so very helpful to get advice from people who have been through this. I wish you and your family the best and that you beat the cancer (if you already haven't) and that it doesnt come back :)"
My guess? She’s really pretty...
"Do what feels right to you. It sounds like you have a wonderful family. Use your time to do things that are meaningful to you and spend time with people you care about. Literally nothing else matters.

I'm so sorry that you are in this situation. I hope you can make the most of what you've got. I second the idea of making videos or writing letters."
"Agreed. 

All their fake posts about how much money they ""made"". "
"I generally agree with these type of posts, but you don't come across very well. You've had 'interventions' and given her ultimatums about her weight gain? 'She's killing this relationship by destroying one of the core foundations of any relationship: physical attraction'? C'mon man this is way too much.

It's ok if you are not attracted to her anymore due to her weight gain, but *it's not a personal affront to you*. She doesn't owe *you* a good BMI. This isn't like paying half the rent."
"Unfortunately, MLM participants are rarely successful — the FTC found that 99.6% of them lose money. You’d have a better chance of success playing roulette (2.9% chance of profit) than doing an MLM (0.4% chance of profit). (I can’t link my source because links aren’t allowed on this sub, but you can find it by searching “FTC MLM profit and loss.”)"
Definitely too much Reddit to make a jump like that
"My boyfriend is a dog person, he grew up at his mothers kennel (responsible breeder, none of that puppy mill shit!) and has never liked cats that much. He knew from the start that my cat and me was a package deal. If he was with me the cat was to be a part of our lives. He never suggested otherwise.

He loved that cat after a while and I am so glad he was with me when the cat got sick and had to be put down. We now have three cats (one we got while the first was still alive, she was so broken when he died so we got her a friend and the third just happened 😅)

Your relationship with your pet is for life. That dog would never abandon you and the fact that he is even suggesting doing that to her at the end of her life for his conveniance proves to me that he's just not a very good person. 
"
"If he's going to live there and put wear and tear on your house then he needs to contribute.  $75k is good money,  yes, but you aren't a millionaire with more disposable income than you can spend AND it doesn't matter anyway. He'd be paying way higher rent anywhere else AND utilities so I say stick to your guns. If he bails then you dodged a bullet. If he gets his shit together he just needed a wake-up call."
"""If the person is actually responsible, the body has ways of shutting that down."""
"Ryan must have had some reason to do what he did. And considering his relationship with his mother and people in general, I believe Sam must have done something bad that ended up triggering Ryan. Whose fault it was and who's telling the truth does matter, because either Ryan is going through some very tough times that drastically changed his behavior, or Sam is hiding something from OP. The only way to find out is to figure out the whole story."
No concerns that he ever told me about
"Do you know if she told her bf about the supposed affair? Because it's pretty convenient of her to try to ruin your relationship and letting hers stay intact, so you could always point that out to your wife or ask your wife if she's talked to the bf to see how he feels. I feel like if he hears about it, his gf will walk back everything she said once her relationship is in jeopardy too."
"I really need to take stock of what I want out of life and ask myself I've ok being the primarily breadwinner.  Part of me says yes because I want kids and I'd save move on childcare if she would stay home.  I make enough money where we would live comfortably. You're so right, how could I get upset when I'm asking her to go half and half on expense ass dates when shes struggling to get back on her feet...."
"&gt; And maybe look into finding a therapist to deal with your resentment about her family getting more time.

Are we really suggesting OP to go to therapy over one minor spat between her and her daughter-and-law? This seems ... excessive. "
"Not legally, logically. They are at different stages of their lives."
I was wondering when that sub would be mentioned. I read the post and thought 'here we go..'
"That's some cognitive dissonance right there, but on the spectrum of   ideological inconsistencies, I suppose it's relatively harmless. I'd just enjoy the relationship until she inevitably tries to convert you."
So how are you working to solve these problems? Don't stay in a terrible relationship and set this as an example for your kids. If you don't have the answers find people who do.
If my dad told me he used to bang men I think I would need therapy lol
"yeah i hate to say it, but ur “lucky” u found out before u had kids with him. he’s dead weight. No job, ptsd, cheater, no sex, lied about cheating... i mean, what is even drawing u to him at this point besides emotional bonding from all the yrs of being together? u stuck by him through all his pain and struggle, but enough is enough. how much longer are u gonna set urself on fire to keep him warm? "
“as many red flags as a communist parade.....” saving this for future discussions with friends making bad relationship choices!
I used to have a classmate when I was in commuter school who did that. The best thing I found was to put in my earbuds and open up a book. Even if I was walking.
"If your boyfriend is odd and creepy enough to prompt total strangers to inquire about your well being then YES please get away from him.

He sounds terrible!"
"&gt; He originally crossed boundaries you hadn’t set yet.

In a healthy relationship, the partners shouldn't *need* to set explicit boundaries for every sort of situation that might conceivably arise in the future. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be guided by the twin pillars of honesty and respect for the relationship. OP's BF repeatedly failed both of these pillars, and even now he's expressly refusing to be honest with OP in the future."
"She doesn't, at least as far as I know...
It's like I don't know her at all anymore"
"So she has large reactions to things that you definitely fucked up on and hurt her, and then you use those reactions as the reason to not sit her down in calm moments and explain what's going on in your head and with the proposal you promised, only addressing problems in your relationship when fights have started. And you don't see why she's feeling jerked around? 

Edit: what I'm trying to say is- if the proposal is coming, just do it. Don't do it 90 days from now or whatever new time line you've come up with. If the proposal is not coming then you very clearly have jerked her around and she should leave you to find someone looking for the same things. If you aren't sure anymore because of recent events sit her down in a calm clear headed time and discuss it like grown ups."
Get divorced. Regardless of whether or not she's cheating your marriage sounds miserable
"Are you OP in disguise? This is like your 10th reply in this thread showing very one sided support for OP. You say the most ridiculous things anytime someone brings up the sister's perspective. 

Suspiciously sparse comment history too. Why is this the thread that gets you going, is it personal? 

Be nice to your sister. I doubt she's as terrible as you say. 

**Edit:** Actually just checked and you are definitely OP. Your first comment on this account was made an hour before this thread was started. That's no coincidence. 

You are 27. Think about the underhanded things you are doing over woman's jewelry and reevaluate. "
"As another pianist (not professional but avid amateur) I'll chip in that I agree you really shouldn't expect too much of a listener. A piano is pretty much a solo hobby and whilst people can appreciate your ability, they will never have 1% of the passion that you have for it. Furthermore, if these are expectations you're placing on a romantic partner then prepare for disappointment if you're expecting a standing ovation and a glowing review after every performance. 

Playing the piano for people can be nice but it's best left for the right place at the right time. "
"Seriously this commenter has no idea wtf they are talking about—ignore them and their crap advice.

I think unfortunately the only thing you can do is wait this out and act cordially and professionally, and hopefully over time people will start to see that maybe you really didn’t do it. If you can continue to improve your relationship with Connor (but still keep it professional!!), that could help too if others see that he’s cool with you."
"Pretty much exactly what is happening. The longer I am away the more I realized how many compromises I had to make with my own value system/beliefs to comfortably live there and it's making me question if those people in-country even really know me at all.

"No, not you, the sentence that the person above wrote out! That would be an alarming message to receive. ""Making love"" isn't the way millennials talk about hookups."

"Hey, some things in life just won't make sense. This isn't about you. Unfortunately, your boyfriend has a ""grass is greener"" mentality currently. Things may have been awesome with you, and maybe they'll be awesome with her too, but he'll be the same guy so that (likely) means he'll eventually get tempted away again.

The world is full of other people who you might have a great connection with. Being in a relationship means committing to the one you're with, not exploring other connections even if they're tempting. It's a choice, and one you can be faced with even if you're really happy with your current partner. This doesn't mean something was wrong with you or your relationship. It just means that he isn't ready to prioritize a commitment over exploring other options, and it has nothing to do with you or how wonderful your relationship was. I'm really sorry, though, good luck healing."
"You did the right thing. My guess is he wanted you to allow him to pursue her while still staying comfortably in a relationship with you. I understand it feels unfair, you dedicated so much to him, and it may never make sense. But you can be proud that you stayed strong and did not let yourself be the second choice."
"I don't know if I'd say ""scummy"" so much as she has a... Perculiar hobby."
"Yeah, she’s being a real boob punch"
"""I'm sorry, this isn't working out. You don't seem to know what you want in regards to niece's care, and reject all of my suggestions, but yell and scream and have tantrums in front of your child because neither of us know what you want. This is unhealthy for niece. 

More importantly, it's more stressful for me. It's painful to see you struggle with trying to have a normal conversation with me. I think it's best if we take a break from each other for a couple of months. When you aren't so angry with me, we can try talking again, if you want that. I am blocking all of your phone numbers, so you won't dial me by accident, and stress us both out. Talk to you in a few months, Love, sis""

Send that to her, and block the fuck out of her. She is a narcissist, an abuser, and possibly a sociopath. The fucking hypocrisy of talking about what your brother pays for your childcare, while paying you less than minimum wage for double the work, is lost on her, and appalling to boot. 

Don't fall for your relatives 'wanting you to visit', then ambushing you with her. If you decide to visit someone, keep your keys in your hand and do not take off your coat or unpack, until you are sure she is not there. do not hesitate to take off if she shows up where you are. Fuck that noise.

if she pulled that shit in a daycare, they'd not only kick her ass out, but have her under a trespassing warning if she showed up again. 

Also, if a baby is up screaming in the middle of the night, either it's hungry, physically uncomfortable, is colicky (most likely) OR HAS ALREADY HAD TOO MUCH FUCKING SLEEP.

I've had kids, and babysat kids. You do NOT give a baby naps that close to bedtime unless you want to stay up with them. Most parents take their cues from their babies, and learn to adjust around them, and not make them try to conform after random guesses. 

YOU OWE HER NOTHING. YOU OWE YOURSELF PEACE OF MIND. Also, if anyone pushes the issue, you can say, ""Well...to be honest I'm relieved because she doesn't want me watching brother's kids, she says so many nasty things about brother's wife, and about everyone else...she was just telling me, before I cut her off, about 'some incident she talked smack about person talking to OP' "" that should shut shit down for a while. 

When people insult others and talk trash about them, they don't realize eventually they will get together and compare notes.

Be prepared for her to talk evil shit about you, once she is forced to find another sitter or put niece in childcare. She will swear you were the worst childcare ever, and that she's glad she 'decided' to put baby with someone 'licensed and qualified'. I can guarantee this will happen. 

MAKE THIS YOUR HILL TO DIE ON, do NOT back down. Once she realizes you won't take her shit, either her attitude will change, or she will realize she can't use you anymore, and will cut you off herself. Users only associate withe people they can gain something from.

Good luck, and stay strong."
"Because, unfortunately, it's a very common, widespread view in medical fields that ""women can just handle / endure the pain"", among other sexist myths. 

Studies from recent years have also shown that doctors often take women's pain less seriously than that of men, leading to views like, ""Oh, you don't need anesthetic. I'm sure you'll just feel a little pinch or tugging.""

(The colposcopy ended up being one of the most traumatic, painful experiences of my life. Other women have described their colposcopy prodecures as ""worse than the pain of childbirth"".)

&gt; ""Unfortunately, women are taken less seriously more often than men when it comes to pain,"" Dr. Jennifer Wider, a nationally renowned women's health expert and the spokeswoman for the Society for Women's Health Research, told Broadly. ""Studies show that doctors, regardless of gender, tend to undertreat female patients and take longer to administer medication to women."" 

&gt; A 2001 study published in the Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics found that doctors often incorrectly believe that women have a ""natural capacity to endure pain"", and possess more coping mechanisms, thanks to ""the stresses of childbirth"". 

&gt; A National Institute of Health study also shows that women tend to wait 16 minutes longer than men when they are receiving pain medicine in emergency rooms. According to the same study, women are 13 to 25% less likely to receive opioids when they are dealing with pain. 

&gt; Women were more likely to be given sedatives, 'suggesting that female patients were more often perceived as anxious, rather than in pain', according to the review's female authors.

&gt; Clinical studies have also found that doctors are more likely to think women's pain is caused by emotional issues, rather than physical ones, even despite tests that show the pain is real.

&gt; Another study, ""Women With Pain"", found that women with chronic pain conditions are more likely to be wrongly diagnosed as having mental health problems than men. British research also shows that women are 50 times more likely to be wrongly diagnosed after a heart attack.

"Also, any sudden change in behavior or attitude warrants at least an exploratory session with a mental health professional to figure out what's going on. People simply don't change drastically without some sort of reason for that change."
"Your husband is allowing all of this to happen. Why are you married to someone who is okay with you and your son being treated as second class? Husband is the problem here, not his parents. If they are nasty and will not treat you all as a family unit, he needs to cut them off. "
"On first read, Charlotte sounds kind of horrifying, but then I thought about it and realized that there are circumstances in which I'm the same. On some topics, I *do* need to know that my friends have the same beliefs or I can't be friends with them. I need to know that my friends aren't racist/sexist, for example. I need to know that my friends believe in science. I *don't* need my friends to follow the same religion I do, I *don't* need my friends to have the same favorite musician - etc. So I would say that it really depends where she's drawing this line, in terms of maintaining the friendship. 

However, it's NUTS that she's doing this at work. "

It could be okay if he had a crush and didn't pretend that he's having sex with said crush when he's having sex with OP. But he is, multiple times, and I think that still would offend the most open and liberal of partners. Especially since he's not telling the truth about it afterward. "

If not for the Asperger's and her own trials and travails this comment section would be unanimously telling you to dump this person. And regardless of whether or not it's her fault, she sounds like a crappy partner  and IMO you need to be selfish in relationships this early in your life.

Do you trust him? I have a feeling you don't..."
Hmm... interesting.  That's an angle I never thought of and sort of brilliant!
Saying he hates you is a deal breaker imo. You deserve somebody that doesn't tell you they hate you when you disagree
"Definitely, under no circumstances take this toxic monster back. You should have left her years ago, man. It hurts now, but it will get better with time, and you'll hopefully realize just how unhealthy your relationship was and be glad you didn't go back to it. She's put you through a lot of unnecessary pain, it seems. She's told you she doesn't want it to work anymore. She's not going to change her mind (until she maybe needs something from you/realizes how hard it is like you said). You're still young. Get the divorce, figure out the kid situation and move on with your life in a healthy way. She doesn't want to be with you. I know it hurts like hell. Shit will be tough for a long time, but it will get better. Focus on yourself and your kids. Staying together in an unhealthy relationship is worse for them than divorcing, IMO. But whatever you do, don't let her back in. She'll only stomp your into the ground over and over."

It's already too late.
"&gt;Looking back, I think he was dreading the day when he thought it would end in sex.

**He doesn't want to have sex with you.** Plenty of religious men can't wait for marriage so they can finally have sex. He's the opposite. He is adverse to having sex with his wife..

The highest likelihood is that he is struggling with his sexuality and is not attracted to you.

* He could be gay and married you because he was taught that is what God fearing men do. He's fully comfortable with a sexless relationship but can't fake it in the bedroom.

* He could be asexual and uninterested in sexual intimacy with *anyone*. Again, in this scenario he knows something is up but has declined to be upfront with you. 

In both scenarios, he married you under false pretenses and filing for divorce or annulment due to fraud is your right. However, being from such a religious/conservative upbringing initiating a divorce is likely the last outcome you want as you face being scapegoated and shunned. **At the end of the day, think of the relationship you want.** It doesn't seem like having a regular old fashioned heterosexual monogamous marriage with sexual passion is in the cards for you, *if you stay in this marriage*. If your husband manages to impregnate you, he'll probably never sexually touch you again once you have all the children he envisioned. 

1. Are you okay with a sexless marriage? 
2. Are you okay with the possibility he might engage in hook ups on the down low with other men while fidelity is expected on your side? 
3. Could you see negotiating an open marriage? Or would he shut down such a conversation and accuse you of being a ""loose woman"" for wanting sex with someone who wants to have it with you?
4. Is divorce and dealing with the fallout of a failed marriage worth it so you can be free to find a compatible partner who you share mutual attraction and who will be an active partner on all levels of your marriage?

Personally, I think number 4 is your best bet for happiness. You're only 21, OP. Why resign yourself to decades of not feeling good enough, having a partner who doesn't care about fulfilling your sexual needs, a partner who may end up pursuing his sexual desires from others as time goes on, and whom if you dedicate yourself to *you cannot guarantee* will stay in the marriage once he finally reconciles his sexuality in a healthy, honest manner?"
"In my experience, college was a hotbed of leftists. I'm sure you can find folks with similar viewpoints to date, or at least people who will approach your views with a spirit of curiosity rather than judgment. "
"I have good news for you: situations don’t have to be 100% anyone’s fault. I’m guessing that if asked, neither of you would say you handled that situation perfectly. 

Judging by what you said about your bf, your assessment that he needs a little space right now is probably accurate. 

To keep yourself from climbing the walls, I suggest you do some thinking about how you want to discuss this. (It helps me to literally write it out, your methods may vary)

If I were you, my main talking points would be along the lines of 1) I know that I hurt you and I am sorry that I did 2) an “i feel” statement about how his current coping mechanism affects you “I feel hurt when you shut me out rather than talking to me about it” (probably needs less accusatory language but you get the drift) and 3) How you want to approach similar situations in the future. How much contact with exes? How should one of you bring up problems with the other, and how should those problems be solved?

I also want to say that I hope your bf is seeking professional help in dealing with his past. I can tell you love him and want to help him but you cannot be 100% responsible for healing his mental health. 

It seems like you two really love each other and I’m sure with some communication practice that you can work through this. "
That’s no good. You need to recognize that you’ve wasted her time. Break up and let her find someone else. 
"So - it's really, really hard for one parent to get full custody.  In most countries in the first world, the default is 50/50 custody.  That your mother hasn't seen you since you were 8 implies one of two things:

(1) She had visitation but didn't bother to use it.

(2) She was barred from seeing you by the court.


With regards to your mother being abused - and accusing your father of molesting you and your sister: it paints her in a very bad light.  You were both very young when she left - and if she knew your father was molesting you, she left you defenseless and unable to get help.  Do you remember any CPS visits as a child? Did you get asked, age 8 or 9 about where your father might have been touching you? If not, then your mother never reported what he purportedly did.

The fact that your mother also visited while your father wasn't home is a pretty large red flag that she visited without his knowledge and planned her visit intentionally to avoid him so she could get access to you and your sister without him knowing.

And that she accused him of abuse and paedophilia - something you feel torn about because you have no memories of anything other than being smacked as a kid - implies some ... pretty fucked up stuff about your mother's intentions.

I would advice, OP, that you talk to your father about what happened when he got divorced.  Why haven't you seen your mother since? Was she bared from seeing you and your sister? Why didn't you at least get to see her during holidays (which even the most lopsided custody plans would have set up)?

You're 17 which means you're old enough to hear what happened.  If he doesn't want to tell you, tell him that she appeared at the door step and she's accused him of some pretty horrendous things and you need to know why she would do that."
It's a bananas insulting expression
"No, it is not appropriate for you to control where your boyfriend goes for his PT.

It's not a problem for him, and he's the one with the injury. 

Seriously, if this is how you react to him seeing an ex at a doctor's appointment, if I were him I'd be paying close attention to all the other jealous tendencies you may exhibit. A mature woman in a good relationship does not act like this. "
"Also. . . I'm 30. And 99.5% of the 18 year olds I meet are just . . . Ugh. Obnoxious and exhausting. 

And it has nothing to do with ""generations"" or the fact that they're responsible for Justin Bieber and One Direction. 

It's because that's just how 18 year olds are. The vast majority of them, through all of recent time. It's something most of them grow out of. But at 18 they think they know everything and they are pretty self absorbed. It's not necessarily their fault, they just don't have much experience in the world and live in their own bubble and eventually they'll get over themselves. I was definitely obnoxious and exhausting at 18. I feel sorry for all the actual adults who had to deal with me. 

I know exactly zero people my age who would go for an 18 year old. 

So for this man to actively seek out an 18 year old when he was married with kids . . . It says not great things about his own maturity and motivations. "
"2- guy I like spends time at my house, and proximity makes him realize he's with the wrong roommate and is head over heels in love with me, instead"

"It doesn't matter if he views it as negative. Of course he views it as negative! He didn't get his rocks off belitting you like he wanted to. 

You're allowed to say ""because this isn't fun for me."" That's a good enough excuse. 

Like, what if you loved roller coasters and he hated them, but you constantly tried to force him to get on and you were like ""Why can't we ever just ride the roller coaster? Why does it always have to be YOUR way?""

Roller coasters aren't dangerous. It wouldn't hurt him to get on a roller coaster. But that doesn't mean he has to like or participate in roller coasters. Because ""this isn't fun for me"" is more than enough of a reason. 

Maybe if you explain it to him like a toddler he'll get it then. "
"Would you ever tell him ""You are really handsome, and you'd be more handsome if you had some muscle on your arms.""? No, because you aren't an asshole.

Does he know about your history? Do you trust him to be sensitive and caring with that information?"
"I agree with you. Sounds to me like it could be a large wedding with RSVP cancellations already, so bride is just trying to fill the paid-for seats with whoever can make it (hence inviting someone she's not close to at the last minute). If boyfriend is telling the truth about just receiving the invitation, he's probably a last-minute invite."
"Honestly she is probably afraid it's going to happen soon because his ex wife was in similar phase when they divorced.... I'm sure she is subconsciously worried about him doing it again, but she won't admit it."
"Yeah. Crushes are fine. You can be attracted to someone else, so long as you don't act on it or damage your relationship. Trying to suppress crushes on either side just leads to feelings of being trapped."

"If you're going do something like this, please don't bring anyone you know around him. 

It's unfair to expect women to feel (rightfully!) unsafe just so they can be his ""learning experience""."
"Honestly, he doesn't seem ready to take advice then and you can't push it on him because then he'll just do the opposite to spite you.  I have a good friend that is in a similar position, he's 34 and never been on a serious date.  Anytime my wife or I recommend something or someone, he always either has an excuse he can't date a girl or just does what he thinks (more like wants) is right.

At this point, we just don't help or say anything on the topic, no reason to.  At some point, he'll get desperate enough to change.  Only time we got close to breaking through was when my wife pointed out, ""how's doing the same thing with the same results working out for you after all these years?"""
Anyone who thinks that “babyfuck” is a great reminder of their best years needs to grow the fuck up.

"There is no perfect time. IMO if you tell them right before you leave they are going to regret any time they could have spent with you but didn't. Also honestly, how important is leaving on Monday?

When you bring it up to Ross, he acts like he doesn’t know what you’re talking about, but he’s behaving that way because he knows you’re right. Sketchy item number two. 

Personally, I wouldn’t be able to not tell my best friend how her husband is behaving and what I’ve personally seen. I’m loyal to my friends to a fault, even if that means putting myself of the middle of things I shouldn’t. I don’t have advice, honestly. You’re stuck in a tough predicament, for sure. Having a baby changes a lot, but maybe Nancy is sensing Ross drifting away and that’s making her crazy? I mean, regardless, Ross needs to step up because his wife just had a baby. "
"Do not marry a guy who doesn't pull his weight around the house *without being asked*. If he can manage to keep his shit together at school and work, and do everything he needs to to pass his classes and keep his job, he has all the skills he needs to do the same in the household: assess the status of the house, find the things that need to be done, and then do them. His prof isn't calling and telling him to do his reading every night, but somehow it's getting done, right? He needs to apply that same skillset to household labor.

If he refuses to, do not sign on for a lifetime of picking up after him. Period."

I texted her about an hour ago basically offering a girls night next weekened with places to try but she hasn't responded yet. Hopefully she'll agree to it.
"""You're not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole"""
"Dude you 100% brought this onto yourself. Your wife clearly stayed many many many times she didn't want kids, yet you pressured her into becoming your incubator.

Did you seriously expect some sort of MOMMY SWITCH that would get turned on and make her into the stepford smiling nuturer? Christ and you've even mentioned trying to get her to quit her job and become a SAHM. How are you this dense????

Honestly it's YOUR responsibility all of this happened so it's really on you to provide for the emotional needs of your kids"
Thank you for your kind comment. My self esteem is at an all time low right now because I don’t feel good enough for my SO. It helps to hear I deserve good things when I spend all day thinking there’s something wrong with me because I don’t have people to open up to about this without feeling embarrassed.
"I really like that you offer two perspectives here. Too many people are under the impression that BPD is a lost cause, which isn’t true. "
Then why not call and apologize? Or call to congratulate her on the pregnancy?

"you buying you girlfriend an 400k house, wtf. Are you looking to be on the hook for common law marriage? And youre supposed to be afraid of commitment? tell me ur a troll."
"I support his right to have an opinion and a ""type"" but I certainly can't support the opinion itself. It's one thing to have that initial physical attraction to someone because they are hot, and then fall in love with their soul shortly afterward. It's another to squeeze your narrow minded viewpoint of what a woman should be like into a tiny box and then ditch a woman you've been with and have a history with because her body has changed and she's gained some weight. 

I'm tiny now but my metabolism will slow down. I can't imagine if I had actually been pregnant with his child (we had a scare but it was a false alarm). I can respect the concept of losing your attraction to someone who only eats junk and truly does totally let themselves go, but to be so black and white in his thinking when he said that he doesn't know if he could continue seeing me if i gained more than 15 pounds...to me that's just delusional. I even made it a point in telling him that if he got chunky I wouldn't think any less of him, but he couldn't say the same for me. He never would answer my question. He continued to harp on and on about body types and how males are physically attracted to certain body types but not to others. "
This is so silly. Why is that guy’s desire to not be around his wife more important to your boyfriend than your feelings? His marital issues shouldn’t impact your vacation plans.

Some folks *do* seem to want to get caught when they’re up to no good. Never considered the chemical rush component.
"Based on your description I think receiving gifts is much higher on hers. Also, if your highest is acts of service, what acts of service have you done lately to show her that you love her?"
"It sounds like the clubbing behavior is normal. However, blowing you off and becoming defensive when you bring it up is a sign. She is acting like she doesn’t care about you and you should listen to that. I’d rather date someone clingy than someone who straight up declined the option to hang out with me but then hangs out with others. "
Agree. I’m in medicine. This seems pretty inappropriate to me
"Just tell people you were raised on a farm. It's true, right?"
"&gt; I think OP needs to be prepared

I agree, that's the biggest thing here. Talking to mom about this will help OP adjust her expectations for the future, so she will know what to expect from mom and can act accordingly to protect herself from further emotional damage."
"I had an ex with the exact scenario, very loving and affectionate with his ex but cannot say he loves me after one year together. He finally told me he doesn’t know if he can ever say it to me. Bottom line is I don’t think he is over his ex completely and I was the rebound girl. We broke up amicably I don’t think I want to be that person that will need to be settled on."
"Seriously. I can't believe this comment is getting upvotes and support.  Since when did a ""serious discussion"" about throwing away hundreds of items, some of them gifts from dead grandparents and close friends, make it all go away and ok?

Something like this would send me into a spiraling depression. My heart would be torn to pieces and the levels of betrayal I'd feel would be unreal. But somehow a talk makes it all ok and worth fighting for. Yeah. Ok then.

ETA: I said this in another comment but she *stole his stuff.* Stealing is taking something that doesn't belong to you without permission. She's a thief with boundary issues. But she's a good person (how?) so it's fiiiine. Whatever man."
"ME TOO. I struggle with this a lot with my husband when he doesn't do things ""my way."" Nearly always it is stupid things that I perceive myself as being able to do more efficiently or neatly, and I have to take a step back and say, ""Yo, hiyatheremister. How important is this, *really*? Does this make a longterm (or even short term) difference in your life?"" The answer is so frequently a resounding ""No."" And then I bite my fucking tongue because life will be so much better that way. "
"I mean honestly it just seems like a waste of space/money. Where's he going to stash this sordid facsimile when your/his parents come to visit?

I'll be the first to recognize that there's a bit of a disparity when it comes to male/female sex toy acceptance but a high tech sex doll with your face/voice is a bit much. 

Can't he just get a flesh light? Hell they even sell kits so you can duplicate the interior of your own vagina. Maybe that is a good compromise?"
That's a huge problem. You need to figure out how to get your communication to a healthy place before you go through with the wedding. Don't start your married life together on this foot. It will be a disaster.

That's not how child support works.
"The OP doesn't say whether any specific examples of each behavior were given. I think that is what would shed light on the real story. Being berated about vaguely defined opinions is totally didferent than being told you're too curt when answering questions or what ever, specific behaviors to work on."

Three years is a long time to live with someone else's family, and it makes sense you're super irritated with these people, but it doesn't sound like anything is actually your friend's fault. It sucks she's teaching the kid to be a pretentious brat, but he's got food on the table and lives in a loving household. It isn't an emergency. He'll be just fine. Don't let your annoyance with having the share your space with these people bleed over into how you treat this trusted friend. You'll be out soon, and if you aren't nice in the meantime, you may regret it."
He needs either a hobby or a therapist. You shouldn't be his psychologist. 
"It's one thing to tell you honestly that he doesn't like a piece of clothing you have. But this guy is crying about being ""deceived"". This is not exactly normal or rational. Dude thought he was within his rights to give you instructions on what to buy."
"Was going to say same thing.  If he was physically abusive, he can do anything."
"It's not about him not liking the sushi, it's about him telling her (a half Japanse chick) afterwards:

&gt; I should know better than to think that the sushi we had was real sushi

It implies that he, an American dude who's only had greasy avocado and mayo sushi, knows better what 'real' sushi is than a half-Japanse woman, her family and an entire fancy sushi restaurant, and he's ALSO saying that OP 'should know better' probably because he figured that she was just as ignorant as him about what real sushi looks like because she's half American, implying that he believes the American sushi is the 'real' sushi when obviously the Japanese sushi is the original."
Holy shit. NPD! Even your acknowledgement of your selfishness is ego\-maniacal. 
To be very honest I feel like going. If this is an olive branch and a chance to explain myself I want to take it. If my partner hears a different story he will have to choose to believe me and if he does not then things aren’t going to work out for us 
"I don’t have advice, I think you kind of already know what you need to do here.  I just wanted to share that I think the “OMG he’s like a BROTHER to me!” While a girl climbs all over your partner is the most obnoxious thing ever. “I have to approve his girlfriends because he’s my BROTHER!” Ugh. No."
"Not necessarily. Some people have so little skills/autonomy and need so much supervision performing the very simple tasks they can do, that they do not add any value. The people that supervise the disabled workers need to be paid, and probably could do all the 'work' the disabled people do themselves in much less time, thus making the disabled people work actually COST money. Some people just can't offer anything that has economic value, and if they are 'working' will actually cost money. This money comes from the tax payers or through a charity. The 1 Euro pay is probably a symbolic payment so the disabled person feels their labour is valuable, when we all know it's not."
He’s not attracted to you because he’s lost in PornLand. Break up with this guy. He’s probably got Deathgrip Syndrome too. You’re too young for this drama.
"Him saying he doesn't want to hear ""excuses"" from you because he teaches teenagers is BREATHTAKINGLY disrespectful. You are his wife and an adult. You are allowed to make your own decisions, be responsible for your own work commitments, and live your own life. He is not your teacher or your dad. He is not your boss. You are not a teenager. 

So you aren't allowed to tell him to ""do shit"" (meaning, to listen to you) but he is allowed to tell you when you have to go to work. Your husband is such an asshole it blows my mind. Seriously I couldn't deal with living with such an arrogant jerk. "
I should note: always used unlubed.
"Yes but the question is also what exactly does he want, does he dream of doing with his life?  What is going to fuel his own passion the next 50 years?  Does he tell you these things?  Do you really know?

To be honest, after the amount of time you two have been a couple, especially since you are so young, very often at least one partner starts to feel a great discontent in how some area of life is going, and they feel like an animal caught in a trap.  You need to be very careful to know your partner, to make sure he isn't feeling trapped in some way, because then the temptation to do something to relieve being trapped will become overwhelming."
Also if he’s not urinating properly there’s a chance toxins are building up in his system which can cause some behavioral issues. 
"Do you two live together? If not, email and text her that it's over, then block her everywhere.

If you do, it'll take more preparation."
"Have you told your husband that you still love him and just need time to cool down? I'm honestly worried about him. If I was in his shoes the guilt and pain would be eating me alive. My SO hates me and I almost killed my child? I'd probably want to be dead.

It's hard to do, but if you haven't already, you might want to try to stifle your anger for just long enough to let him know that you still love him, but that right now you are very upset and need some space to cool down. I've done it before and it really can help. Unless you think this really will change how you feel about him as a person"
"I don't have any better advice then others who have posted, I just wanted to say I'm sorry you're dealing with this. It's a perfect example of woman-on-woman hate, it's toxic, mean girl shit and it certainly has no place at work. It makes me sick that women do this shit to each other, and it happens all the time everywhere. They can't see past their jealousy/envy. 

Just keep living well, and talk to your boss about this, drop the words ""hostile work environment"".  And congratulations!"

"Can I just say.. Leaving the phone number to ""let you know when he's thinking about going next.."" so smooth. I would have totally blown it with something corny and overly forward.

I wish third updates were allowed so you could let us know when you fall in love and get married and adopt 3 golden retrievers ugh."
"I personally would tell her, its a pretty big thing and if she ever finds out you knew and never told her you relationship would probably be over, now if you tell her there is the potential that she wont believe you and be in denial, but at least you know you did the right thing in my opinion. good luck!"
"You, Steve and Mary need to all back the fuck off each other, calm down and think about what is best for Jason at all times. Your entire post is me me me, or petty bs that is of zero importance when it comes to the common ground here... Jason.

YIKES. that is so much. you need all the peace and quiet you can get. service industry jobs take all the social energy out of you and when you get home you want to NOT. TALK. and you definitely don't want to have to attend to someone else's needs... even if they are a good kid (it's not about that, so don't feel guilty - it's just not the right time for you to have childcare as an added responsibility). Tell your boyfriend. This is a great example of the stuff you need to be able to talk about with him if the relationship has a chance of working out.

Look, i understand you'd like your mom and your inlaws to get a long. This isnt the way to do it. Regardless of whether your mom is on the autistic spectrum or not, she obviously has social stress and gets echausted by it. There are ways to help introverted people like your mom, by having small gatherings, shortening the amount of time together,  having it be an activity she likes. Ways to not to get your mom to like your inlaws more? Throw her in the opposite, huge gathering, long amount of time and have her stressed out from the fighting over this event!"

"Their point is: you need to move out. This is the role they have created for you, and while you're living at home you will fill it. You need to find a way to move out, now. Get a night job, get roommates, anything to get over the hump and make it feasible. It's obviously an important step for your psychology that has been pushed off too long. You should have the ability to just....not care what your parents do! Aside from loving them and hoping for the best for them."

"What you're feeling is insecurity. You're threatened by this other guy for some reason, and that reason could be rooted in a lot of different places, for example: feelings of inadequacy around sex (performance, size, etc.), body issues, fear of losing your partner, the guy reminds you of someone you had a bad experience with, etc. etc. 

Point being, you need to look in the mirror and figure out why this bothers you. Write it out, talk it out, do something to get into that feeling of being bothered by your neighbour. The more you can understand why you feel that way, the better you'll be at shaking it. "

"plus when these kids get older there's always a chance mom might bond better with them as adults. no promises but seriously OP, what did you expect. a woman who doesn't want KITTENS wasn't going to change her whole nature just because she had kids you wanted. this is HER. 

for now, as long as she's providing, you might have to pick up the slack when it comes to lovey dovey nurturing parent skills. also, kids aren't stupid. they'll notice mom's distance and personality. something to consider.

"Oh, come on. Just tell her, and apologize for wasting 2.5 years of her life."
"I agree with u/airaqua that the first step is to sit him down for a serious conversation, to figure out where he actually stands on marriage. You can’t move forward without first establishing that.

If he is OK with getting married, you can start talking timelines. Do you want to be married in ten years? Five? You don’t need to set a date or anything, but figuring out a general “we’ll be married by X” is extremely helpful for setting expectations on both sides.

If he’s not sure, then it may be time for him to talk to a counselor or a professional. It’s not fair of him to leave you dangling like this, so he needs to sort out his feelings ASAP.

If he’s against getting married, and it’s not a dealbreaker for you like you say, then it’s on *you* to move past this (with outside assistance, if needed). If he’s clear that marriage is not in his future, and you still want to be with him, then it’s terribly unfair to keep pressuring and guilting him by bringing it up."
"&gt; He doesn’t expect me to go to a school out of state, just says it would mean a lot to him and his family to have that door open.

How are they all going to feel when you don't walk through the door? I'm anticipating a lot of pressure from your boyfriend if you get accepted to the other school. 

As you know, I'm sure, in the US, where you go to law school really matters in terms of your job prospects. Your local school will feed into your local legal job market better than the out-of-state school (unless it's a top school that can go nearly anywhere). In other words, if you caved to the pressure of attending his state's school, you may be stuck there for years. 

I don't trust your boyfriend's intentions here. It isn't making a lot of sense to me. My guess? His family is giving him shit about moving and he's working on having you relocate."
Fuck politeness...dont get murdered. 
"Does your company have an HR department?  

If it's not an ongoing issue then I think the best option would be to maintain a strict professional distance and only see her when you have to, and to not spend any time alone with her if possible.  I don't think talking to her directly is a good idea if she has firing power over you.  I also don't think chalking it up to Alzheimer's is likely.  

Maybe consider looking for a different job?  At least, if it's possible to do so and you can't stand working with her.  "

"&gt;He says it's unfair.

It's also unfair of him to basically have you in a committed relationship without having the common decency to publicly acknowledge that's what it is.  

What's fair to him doesn't really matter.  You have to do what's best for you.  "
"&gt; he's acquainted with her (that's how he remembered her profile).

No possibility that he's interested in her and wants you out of the way? Feelings make people do weird things, even with friends.

You're right that he's probably telling you the truth, but it would be pretty shitty of you to accuse her of this if she didn't do it. And if you confront her and she denies it, you don't know for sure so who do you believe. Also, there is the evidence that she's dating you and hasn't done anything to make you think that she's racist (right?).

Edit: Also, why does he remember this specific thing about her?"
"The only thing she did to her son was isolate and hurt him, both emotionally and physically. There was no attempt to protect him from anything. She saw him as a predator and treated him as such."
Would he talk to a therapist about this? His feelings of guilt over a situation he can't change are something worth discussing with a professional.
I read your OP and I can't believe people were trying to tell you this was just your insecurity. There was clearly something more to it. Trust your gut.
"Don't worry, some times we need to have pity parties. I really don't blame you for yours at all, cause it sounds objectively shitty. I'm sorry you had such a rough time, but I hope Europe is working out for you! 

I find it a shame that Americans (*very* broad sweep, pardon the generalisation) say stuff like ""the land of opportunity"" and ""the greatest country in the world"", but from where I'm sitting comfortably in Norway, America sounds like *the worst* country in the first world by a pretty brutal margin. Anything from the school systems to health systems to politics to judiciary to commonly accepted social views just makes me think ""I wouldn't want to live there even if I got paid for it"". USA doesn't even make the top 10 (it barely made the top 20) on the annual world happiness report by the UN, while 7/10 of those are European countries.

"What did you expect? She didn't want kids. Some people are not maternal, some people do not feel attachment like others do. "
"&gt; And he basically laughed at me, saying that I wouldn't know what busy is, without having kids.

Good God, I hate this bullshit bingo response that some parents like to throw around. The idea that you can't be tired/sick/busy because you don't have kids is so repulsive and condescending. He can complain about parenthood all he wants, but nobody forced him to have kids, and he knew what he was getting into. It sounds like he's dismissive of you because he frankly can't comprehend that your life doesn't revolve around his kids. I'm a childfree person by choice (and 100% would never date someone with a kid but I'm married so moot point) so admittedly this stuff annoys me to no end, since I hear a shitload of bingos on a daily basis, but it sounds like he just doesn't respect you all that much. He (rightly) puts his kids first, but it's completely unfair that he basically uses them as an excuse and then tries to make you feel shitty for it. "
"Marriage isnt my priority. I just want to know that he is as committed to me as I was to him. He was thinking about moving overseas, and I was supportive of that 100% but I didnt know if he wanted me to go with him if he eventually settled down in another country. I was so worried about him leaving, I wanted to know if I factored into his plans at all. I do love him a lot, and leaving him is one of the hardest things Ive had to do. It wasnt a spur of the moment decision and it wasnt what I wanted but this is ultimately what was best, imo. Please dont tell me I wasn in love with him, because you dont know everything. This is a snapshot of our relationship, not it’s entirety. I appreciate your feedback and I think if you knew everything it may not come across as superficial.  "

I had pretty good premarital counseling, but managed to ignore some red flags because I was 23 at the time - you can love someone dearly, but they might not be the one you should be marrying. Don't go into it hoping to have your relationship ""confirmed"" - go into it with the view that you're both kicking the tires to see if what you have is marriage material. Marriage is a whole different kettle of fish."

This is perfect. He has consistently said no which is why I stopped. Don’t get me wrong I do enjoy the times we spend together but there’s been a few times I’ve only done it for him. He doesn’t understand how I do things with him if they don’t interest me and why he would do that for me. It’s always been like this. I feel like I don’t even know what I enjoy anymore.

"Sexual compatibility/physical intimacy is very important to some people. That's ok. It doesn't mean they're sleazy, it doesn't mean you're a prude. It just means you have different boundaries and priorities. Nobody is a bad guy here."
"What if you looked into fostering/adoption? Some families get a regular stipend when they take in children. You two could provide a vital service for a child and your community. The financial aid may make an additional child possible earlier than the cost of having a child on your own. 

Are you still entitled to any sort of tuition assistance for having served? Do any companies in your area prioritize hiring veterans? Would your wife consider obtaining some sort of certification in child care? She could essentially be paid to test out whether she wants 3 full time or not. She could save that money or you two could put it towards the vasectomy reversal. I know you're traditional but she may enjoy providing childcare services. If you're so inclined, I suggest you look at Proverbs 31:10-31. (disclosure- I'm personally an Atheist but it's pretty damned OK as far as wife 101 goes.)

You're working your ass off to provide and spending you're time off making sure you're family is happy. That's one of the most respectable things I know of. You haven't failed, you're still in there fighting and doing a damn fine job. Talk to your wife, you guys have options. You only fail if you give up on this one."

There's a sub about people who do that, it's called r/NiceGuys and it's not pretty. Don't be that guy."

In the very beginning he was talkative. It died down after marriage (and kids).

Then why are you questioning your responsibility?
"I think that is a teensy bit harsh. I can understand OP being hesitant because this situation involves someone she cares about and is close to, so her emotions about it are muddying the waters here. 

I think this post is more to work through her feelings and validate that reporting is the absolutely right thing to do. Which it obviously is. "
"&gt; And the fact that you claim it's valid suggests that you are not fully accepting that it was you who was responsible.

Absolutely spot on. "
"Good answer! Even regardless of possible pain from the braces, there should be communication that occurs before it gets to this point."
"Tell him he’s said his piece, and now needs to leave you alone and let you make your own decision about the job. You’re an adult, you can both have your own opinions. But there’s a difference between sharing your thoughts, and being pushy about it. "
Seriously. I can’t believe the responses here blaming OP. 
"Aren’t you already at a breaking point? You said something like before you were just tired, now you are done. You will only grow more resentful and detached as time goes on and nothing changes. It sounds like you want to save your marriage if at all possible, and I don’t think postponing therapy until some future point will benefit that goal. Does your husband know something is wrong, or have you kept your feelings to yourself?"
"You might have a /r/justNoMIL situation on your hands OP :(

I hope she's not a jerk in disguise and congratulations on the baby. It's stressful and she stole your announcement but it's your baby and you call the shots. Wishing you a healthy and happy pregnancy from here on out. "
"Does he help around the house otherwise? Cooking? Cleaning? Scheduling things? Making sure bills get paid? Fixing things? Identifying things that need to be fixed/cleaned? Grocery shopping? Picking out gifts for other people? Other emotional labor? (If you aren't familiar with the term, google ""MetaFilter emotional labor"").

If he's otherwise a valuable partner, I'd say he just has some sort of wedding block. It doesn't excuse his pathetic behavior (I thought the ""limp pool noodle"" description someone else used was fantastic), but at least it's a sign that his issue is with the wedding/wedding planning, and it isn't just a reflection of your entire relationship.

If he ISN'T otherwise a valuable partner, I vote call the whole thing off. You are absolutely not being a bridezilla, and he absolutely does not deserve a pat for picking out some f'ing *socks*. Having to pull all the weight for wedding planning is clearly (and rightfully) upsetting you. Is this how you want the rest of your life to be with him too? "

Marriage is easy, living together is hard. How will you be able to test this relationship if you don't move in until marriage?

To ask this another way, what if you move in after getting married and discover that you absolutely hate living together? Wouldn't you want to know that *before* you tied your lives together forever?"
""" she said she is first and foremost herself""

I can speak to that.  I lost everything that was myself when my girls were born. I quit doing my art, I quit doing anything I didn't have to do for my house and my kids.  Then one day I realized I was a shell of a person and I didn't want to teach my kids to behave this way when THEY have kids.  So I picked up my art, and started dressing myself and taking better care of myself.  There was NO other person involved outside my marriage for all of this to take place. 

So, I am Me, and I am a Wife, and I am a Mother.  In that order.

She may be feeling like she was working on things in the marriage for a while.  Maybe her comment from her coworker about being hot made her pay some attention to herself.  I do wish she would try to work on your marriage more, but you shouldn't begrudge her for working on herself."
"I hope he’s not unfaithful tbh. I’m a former betrayed spouse myself actually; had a serial cheating (only discovered that after we’d spent 15 years of our lives together) ex husband, so I understand how awful it can feel even to entertain the possibility. 

But, with that said, I also learned how to see through the bullshit excuses all cheaters use to get away with having their cake and eating it too. Whether or not she came to visit him at any point; or whether it was all emotional infidelity (or just emotional after the first trip) is not even that pertinent. It still is emotional infidelity and that’s not okay on his part either."
"Cause 500k/yr jobs are that common.

It isn't subsidizimg. It is treating your partner fairly. I'm not talking about the partner buying a Ferrari and the person making 500k has to support that. I'm talking about rent, bills, common purchases, etc. 


From a selfish perspective, if you are splitting everything 50/50, as the person making 500k, you will be constrained by the person making less's income. If they financially aren't able to match you 50/50 because they have less money a month, then you can't go on vacation 4 times a year, or afford a super nice place, etc. 


If you make 60k, you can't afford a very expensive place. The person that makes 500k might want. 


The person is your partner, you shouldn't cause them financial hardships. "
Yep. It's possible to have a low-key night drinking with friends and still get up in the morning. My friends and I do it all the time. 
It's not your decision. You raised your concerns. Your daughter may or may not take them into account. Keep quiet unless you want to lose your daughter and your future grandchild.
Very different situations. They are 21 with no marriage or children.
 I feel like offering to do the trip another weekend should have been immediately suggested when he was called out for planning something else that weekend.

Its fucking unreasonable of her to touch you when you don't want to be touched."
"&gt; This is definitely a different situation than just a dude who's afraid to leave home.

yes, but.... while I sympathise, the GF is still right - I mean whats the alternative? At what point WILL he be ready to move out? She could live 5 years. 10 years...  is everyone's life to be on hold?

It's not like he will never see her again if he moves out"
If he won't talk then he's being an immature asshole and you need to move on.
"Your friend's childish and she sounds like one of those people that create their own issues. Do what you want with the guy, the friend will either get over it or move on. Truthfully, she doesn't sound like a great friend anyways and if it wasn't this situation It'd be another."

"Sorry if this comes off as an insensitive question, but how severe is his disability?  Maybe that’s the thing messing with his drive.  

Edit: I just saw you mentioned sleep apnea and arthritis.  And that they’re treated and not too severe.  I want to say that chronic loss of sleep and chronic pain are two total doozies of an energy killer but like you said they’re being treated.  I also saw that therapy isn’t an option due to stigma in the military so that really sucks.  I’m conflicted- part of me wants to say “it’s a rough spot, but you made vows, give him some time to find himself.” But part of me wants to say “it’s your life, you only get one, you shouldn’t waste it on someone who isn’t bringing their a-game.”  It’s a tough situation.  An ultimatum may be something, if you haven’t tried that.  From what it sounds like the relationship isn’t horrible it’s just lost the spark, so maybe something could be salvaged.  Say “I love you but not the life we’re living, you need to do these three things within the next x amount of time or I’m going to need to start looking to move on.”  "
"You're wrong.

He set up this situation by making an impulsive proposal without first making sure that she was on board for a proposal at this time. It's all on him."
"It's happening because your boyfriend is kind of terrible.  Maybe he's like this all the time and only can't hide it when he's drunk. Maybe he's only like this when he's drunk. Either way, I'd wait until he's sober and tell him that the way he treats you when he's been drinking is hugely unacceptable and he better knock it the fuck off toot sweet. 

Also, if I were you, I'd stop helping him with his outings. Let him do that shit 100% by himself. He arranges his own snacks, his own sweaters, his own rides. It may be that there's a sort of women hating culture with his friends and he feels like he needs to keep up by bashing you, or he could just be totally unappreciative. But until he learns not to act like a spoiled toddler, he doesn't get special treatment. He's a grown man and needs to act like it. 

That said, honestly I think he's just terrible and slightly better at hiding it while sober. You said he won't respond to you while playing video games... why? Because video games are more important to him than whatever you might need? Friend, my husband will drop whatever he's doing to at least glance at my texts (even if he can't always respond right away) in case I might be in trouble or need a favor on a time limit. Your boy can't even do you the courtesy of a *glance*. 

I think you can do better. "

"Get your son a lawyer ASAP. He's an adult (barely) and he's spending the night in jail. An assault case against him can do serious damage to his life -- derail his plans for school, make it hard to get a job, etc. Your husband's story does not add up. Peaceful, happy, well-adjusted kids don't snap because they're TOO peaceful, they snap if someone is putting pressure on them. 

Are you in the US? If so, did the police say that your son will be arraigned tomorrow? Do you know any lawyers in your community? Even if they're not criminal defense lawyers, maybe they can recommend a good criminal defense lawyer. You said your son is active in your church--call your church leaders now, wake them up if you have to, and ask them to help arrange for a lawyer. Do you have money to pay a lawyer? You do need to talk to Ryan and get the truth from him, but more important is preparing for navigating the criminal justice system. If you are in the US, things move fast and the system does not favor the unprepared. "
"&gt; my boyfriend the next day wouldn't believe my story until he ""talked to everyone and got the full story."" 

And he had been sitting right there the entire time? 

Here's a little analogy. Go check out /r/justnoMIL. If you have spent much time around these parts, you may already have heard much about this. The conventional wisdom is that it is the son or daughter of the offending MIL who has the primary responsibility to to stand up for their SO and defend them against an abusive MIL. 

Well here you have a boyfriend who is showing you exactly your place on his list of priorities. He not only fails to protect you from assaults, actual physical and sexual assaults, he gaslughts you about their occurances so as to preserve his friendship with your assailant. Hence the assailant continues with impunity. 

You don't have a friend problem, you have a boyfriend problem. 

As long as your boyfriend is in your life, this person will have unrestricted access to physically abuse you. 

The best time to leave your boyfriend would have been the first time this happened and he did nothing. The second best time is now. 

I mean it. This is not worth discussing. At this point, your boyfriend is not different from an abuser because he invites an abusive person to have access to you and now is lying and gaslighting you about it. 

As long as you are with your boyfriend, you will never be physically safe. This will escalate until you are raped, seriously injured, or worse. 

You need to do the exact same thing that any abuse victim does. Take a picture of your bruises, find somewhere different to sleep starting tonight if possible, make a police report, get your stuff out of the apartment while your (hopefully soon-to-be-ex) boyfriend is not home, send a text telling him that you are breaking up and he is not to contact you again, and immediately block his calls, texts, and on all social media. 

You can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233 for more help making a detailed safety plan for getting out of this unsafe relationship. "
"Exactly, he's already painting a picture of OP's son that conflicts with the child that she raised and knows to try ro gain the upper hand."
"Right we know literally nothing.

Son: kind calm kid who went through bullying without ever snapping. Never been violent before. Does well in school and is even praised by teachers Just turned 18 age of when you are tried as an adult.

Husband: responsed to being asualted with ""he knew he would snap one day"" which sounds really suspicious and had never brought this concern to the mother before. Is always annoyed but treats mother ""fine"". 

And that they dont get along well especially lately.

Sure there are many possible reasons but it seems the most likely that the Husband did something."

Someone else mentioned ADHD, but it bears repeating. It can be a lot harder to catch ADD/ADHD in women than in men, and it might be that. If not, there are ways she can get better. If she is around her phone a lot, a to-do app with recurring tasks(Check x, take out y, do z) and heavily utilizing alarms. Get an Alexa device and get into the habit of setting timers. It's a lot easier to yell ""Alexa, remind me to get the laundry in an hour"" than to set an alarm on your phone or just... remember. 

There are plenty of tips and tricks and life hacks to help here, but this is who she is. Her brain is wired like this. She won't ""mature"" because this is how her brain works. And it's on her to counteract that. "
"If Sam hit Ryan first, has been abusive to him in any way, or told Ryan he was going to abuse the mom/little brother, then that’s not grounds for therapy, it’s grounds for divorce. What caused the fight needs to be cleared up immediately so they can decide if therapy is even an option. I know this sub loves their therapy, but it’s not always a solution, especially if there has been ongoing abuse. "
"That the younger person is dominating the much older person and generally speaking, making them feel like shit. 

Like I would think, if as (I think) you are saying, the age disparity doesn't make much difference in many cases, that there should be older people making young people feel like shit, and young people making old people feel like shit, if there's no imbalance purely due to age. But it seems exclusively old preying on the youngs insecurities, enough that it should generally be considered a factor in predatory behaviour."
"The problem I see with this idea is that this would put a huge burden on the wife's friend. They would now have to decide wether to hurt her or to lie to her too, in case they don't feel it's good to tell her. "
Seriously. This thread is fucking bizarre to read through. Why is op being trashed in here when they both decided on a plan and she later bailed on the plan when op was already on the trip. She is an adult and should not be holding op emotionally responsible for her own decisions. 
"&gt; something everyone does, experiences, and can't control

Um... what. If cheating was something ""everyone did"" why is there such a stigma behind it and why does it destroy so many relationships.

"Whatever your religion, gender or age; never ever let anyone pressure you into sex! Never ever let anyone pressure you into marriage!

Have a think about why people get married. Love and commitment and seeing a future together... Getting married just to have sex is a very bad idea.

"How are your parents? Can you talk to them? 

How you actually don't feel safe around your sister/friends? This might not work if your parents A)think of your sister as perfect. B) Think in gender stereotypes where guys always want girls to flirt with them, C) Don't like Natalie, or for many other reasons.

"You say the package wasn’t wrapped in plastic but was it a sealed cardboard container? Like the kinds used for lots of food products like granola bars?

"&gt;Losing these friendships is not an option, anyone who would make me choose between them and my friends is not the person for me. Should I just say that straight up, and tell him about my history with my friends?

If this is your stance, it would be best to bring it up early and use it as a screening qualification. No point getting invested in someone if you know this is a dealbreaker, and it's easier on them too, so they don't have to choose between losing someone they've become invested in or compromising on their own boundaries and dealbreakers."
"I think you should probably have a discussion with him about the reality that your contraception failed, OP.  That seems like the operative concern here with regards to your relationship with him.  I don't mean that in an accusatory way, just the reality that these things happen.

"Yeah well I agree with the keys. But I’ve had them for 6 months and never come unannounced. I think everyone except the sister knew I had the keys. They never once said anything to me or partner. I have given them back to my partner as right now I don’t even need them, I don’t want to see them. I do fully realise they have a right to say I shouldn’t have keys and that they don’t like being called mum and dad but they should have either told my partner or me instead of complaining about it to his sister. 

Yeah to be honest after all of this things are pretty rocky with us right now. I said I don’t know how things are going to work out going forward because I can’t rely on him like I thought I could. Right now, I hope he discusses this with his parents properly and in the long run moves out because even before this I didn’t like the idea of moving in with his mum and dad (I don’t even want to live with my own parents, let alone someone else’s).

I am asking because people should be starting to hit their stride by 30, but here he is, aggressive, drinking himself stupid, living in a houseshare with several other roommates....  It's like he's a few years behind, making the sort of stupid mistakes a guy makes in his early twenties, but not learning from him.  This guy's life is slipping away from him and it is pissing him off.  And you're his scapegoat.  Lucky, lucky you.  What triggered it?  Who knows, maybe he had feelings for you, or for David, or he was jealous of you two having a functional relationship (no sign of a GF for him, huh?), or he resented being called out on his irresponsible drinking.  

So he is scary and drunk and petulantly aggressive.  You can let that stop you from going over to visit your BF and friends.  Maybe that's what will help them grow the will to kick him out?  Probably not.  They seem quite passive and maybe also scared of him.  So you can either stay away and miss your friends or go over.  But do not ever allow yourself to be alone with him.  No accidental hallway meetings, e.g.  Get David to help you out.  See if you can enlist one or more of the other roommates to act as escorts too.  Hopefully John will either doing something stupid in front of others, forcing them to confront how awful he is and give him the boot, or John will quit the house on his own accord in a fit of pique.  One caveat.  If you have any sense that John is going to grow physical with you, even with an escort/bodyguard, avoid him even if it means avoiding your friends."

"This is *rough*. You aren't getting a nice, slow, calm introduction to adulthood. You're getting thrown in the middle of a lake and need to quickly learn how to survive.

You don't necessarily need to call the police and report your mom. While I'd encourage it if you're strong enough to do it, there are plenty of other things you can do as well if you can't go that far right now. For example, you can tell your dad you would tell the truth if he reports it. Which you can use to judge whether he's prepared himself for leaving and would be willing or not. Also, if it happens, he can do some of the heavily lifting emotionally and you can just tell the truth. You are 17, and as an almost-adult the justice system is going to pay more attention to what you say. You aren't simply a child that doesn't know what's happening. 

If you can't go that far either see if your parents will let you go to some counselling or therapy. Counselors are mandatory reporters, but they can help you through the struggle of how protecting yourself can mean removing bad influences in your life even if it's family.

You are in a very terrible position. Whatever you choose, keep in mind that you are not powerless. There are things you can do and help you can get to support you though what you're dealing with. It's not easy, but keep that control in mind. Research places in your area that might be able to help you or family counselors and family therapy centers that could help. "

"I’m wondering if you ever discussed his views on homosexuality. Did he ever seem uptight about it ? Does he know your friend is LGBT? Does he think  the two of you perhaps are attracted to each other?

Speaking as a straight motorcycle driving woman, the stereotypes are out there. "
"If it was just about the dress I'd say meh and move on, but this is about so much more. We spent a lot less on ours but my husband was fully involved. He spent more time actually because rather than hire a DJ he put together a bunch of mix CD's to be played over the sound system during the reception. (Was 2002) Cut your losses. "

I called him out for his insensitivity, and he would hit me with the “I’m racist? How dare you say that, you’re offending me. That’s f-ed up”. I know he is not racist, I know he treats everybody equally, 

He is racist. Racism isn’t just about how you treat others, it’s the attitudes and beliefs that you hold towards members of races. Generalising all black women as crazy and suggesting that his brother’s GF was not worthy of an association because she was black is totally racist. 

You’re right to be apprehensive about marriage. Marriage doesn’t fix problems in a relationship. Often it can amplify them. And contempt and disrespectful behaviour can often increase as a relationship progresses. 

This is not something you can control. It is on him to stop being so cruel, disrespectful and condescending. The one thing you can do is request that he go and get individual counselling. If he refuses, leave. If he does go but it makes no difference, leave. "
Jeez I'm sorry you went through that.

Except it's a co-ed trip so let's not make this about gender when it's not
I think you’re well overreacting. Not texting you back constantly when he’s out with new people is totally normal. It’s a big jump from that to cheating... if you have nothing else I’d let it go. 
What you’re saying doesn’t match your actions. You’re sort of already a clingy helicopter wife who’s getting angry over him not texting for a night. Trying too hard to protect the marriage is probably causing more damage than anything.
"Did you tell her about the kissing? Was there any other kissing other than on the forehead? Like during your final conversation?

You have to realize your wife does not trust you right now, not even a little bit.. she'd be smart to leave."
"I'm not sure if other commenters have mentioned it yet, but has your husband been screened for depression? You've both had a lot of life changes and that takes a huge toll on mental health. Your husband had a major career shift, educational shift, and now has relocated overseas a few months ago. That's a heck of a lot. My husband and I are dual military and we just PCSd out of Europe, I know a lot of civilians and well qualified spouses who had great difficulty finding meaningful work. Some were never successful through their whole tour.  

I agree that he needs to step up at home at least if he's only working part time, you guys need equitable division of labor to happen. Therapy for both of you together and he needs it individually or at least see behavioral health for an evaluation. Leaving this relationship the way it is with no effort is going to doom it. "

"No dude...I'm not going to tell you that you should have sex before marriage because that is your choice and something you'll always have to live with...but do NOT get married simply so you can have sex without guilt. On top of the already less-than-bedrock foundation of strikingly different belief systems, getting married for a reason like this is going to do nothing but set you up for heartache later. Not to mention, if/when the divorce comes around, you'll realize it was an expensive way to lose your V-card. While I believe that getting married without knowing how compatible you are sexually is potentially problematic, it's worse to get married simply to be able to have sex...the sex will come and go in a marriage...you will have dry spells, but if that's the only reason you got married, you'll quickly realize you married for the wrong reasons. 

Tl;dr don't do it, the ability to have guilt free sex due to your religion is a terrible reason to tie yourself legally to someone. "
"OP, it's rape. Would you ever fuck an unconscious person?"
Not hugging your kids very much isn't neglect. Particularly in a dual-caregiver household where one of the parents is giving them hugs and physical affection.
"I'm answering this as a programmer by living and a programmer in my free time also - you're absolutely right that those are his father's terms and he either accepts them and lives rent free or finds his own place.


However, if he just likes spending all his free time using a computer, that's who he is and forcing him to ""do something new"" seems like not accepting him the way he is. Don't get me wrong - my ex was like that and I broke up with him, but his father is not his lifetime partner and should accept that his son is an adult and has his own hobbies. Perhaps he doesn't enjoy making art or taking a yoga class.

As a former heavy gamer, I can say there is lots of stuff you can do with a computer - not just play games, but also create (write, program, paint, make music), communicate with people, create with people (multiplayer building games like Minecraft), read stuff (reddit, 9gag), discover (instagram, tumblr) and it just seems rude to me that people try to change it.

I mean there are people who for example love traveling and hiking and that's literally all they do in their free time and it's not like you come to them and try poking them with a stick and say: ""Hey, you hike too much, ever tried a new hobby not including nature, like playing League of Legends?"""

"Oh snap foreal? 

So I'm a grad student in genetics and that's really interesting to me because if it's *all* the women on one side of your family it suggests it *could* be a genetic thing. Nothing bad just not generically disposed to form a ""bond"" with newborns. So I'm gonna ask a few annoying questions and I hope that's ok.

Is it all the women on one side?
How many would you say you've observed with this trait in total?
Are you a woman? If you are would you say that you feel the same way?

"Yeah, read his post history. He’s posted multiple times about his fiancé and Mom, gets pummeled in the comments and then deletes the post when no one agrees with him and says his mom is way overstepping her boundaries by asking a woman with a one month old baby to trim hedges and paint stuff. He’s asking for help but won’t listen to anyone because they’re not saying what he wants to hear. "
"If their dad was the more 'emotional' and supportive one they would probably rely on their dad far that more though. I don't think its a female thing. Like many people in this thread have said, people grow up with good but emotionally distant dads all the time, and the mum fills the emotionally nurturing role. I don't see how it can't be the other way round."
As it should be. But society has this wrong image that women are the affectionate ones and OP is obviously playing into this. His wife is just not a kid person. He knew that when he pushed her into unwanted motherhood.
"&gt;She'll find out eventually, and she'll feel like an idiot if it doesn't come from you.

This.

When my bf and I got together, a friend of his brought his ex-FWB to a party (so basically, he had no possible way of knowing she'd be there until she walked in). 

You know what sucked? Finding out *after the fact* that they were FWB, and that's why she was mildly awkward/cold towards me. My bf felt terrible, but there was no time for him to warn me without making it super obvious. So everyone in the room watched this awkward af exchange go down, while I was completely oblivious. I did, in fact, feel like an idiot, even though I couldn't have known. Learn from my bf's mistake, tell her."
"I can only give you anecdotal evidence, but I have no maternal bone in my body. I force it for me nephews, but I can do that because I only see them for a few hours at a time."
I think the commenter might be thinking of birth control sabotage...from OP.
"It's quite common.

Society paints this picture that all women are fluffy, nurturing and want babies.

Do you see the same painted about men?

No. Because it's bullshit.

Women are people, first. Some people want kids. Some don't. Some have zero parental instinct. Some have the instinct but no desire to have children. Some men are more ""maternal"" than some women.

It's a spectrum. Women, like men, exist on it, but we're battling a constant stereotype that women should be this/that."
OP isn't his daughter any more than with the *biological* offspring of a sperm donor.
How is OP (a coworker who isn't very close) supposed to find out? I think they should trust that the email from the family is her wishes.
Yeah your point makes sense to me... My mom was the one who stayed home when I was 0-5 yrs old and made a ton of sacrifices and was way more 'hands on' but I do love my parents equally. 
Anyone who doesn’t take no for an answer is dangerous and you need to walk away. Red Flag.

"Nothing about it is inherently a “problem” though. The issue is not with your biology, but with expectations.

The real problem here is her total disrespect and lack of empathy."

"I would advise against looking at this as an interaction that needs to be ""won,"" or an ""OP vs boss and this woman"" situation. "

So I didn't want to throw that at her if she wasn't ready to hear it, because it can be devastating when you realize what actually happened from an objective viewpoint."
"Honestly OP, it sounds like you've spent your life in service to your mum. She didn't forget you, you don't  forget your children. She sounds selfish and like now she has a ""new"" family and doesn't need your money, she isn't interested in including you."
"Just an aside, he is not in school full time. Two days a week is part time unless he somehow scheduled at least 12 credit hours into those two days (which I was never able to pull off in five years of undergrad, there's always that one mwf class).

"I hope you take what this person has said seriously. I read this subreddit every day but never comment. But something about this situation is so crazy that I can't help it.

If my wife wanted to go to bed at 8 or 9, I'd be like ""Okay that's a little odd but do whatever you want. Goodnight have a nice sleep.""

If she tried to shame me into staying out until 9pm, I'd have to laugh. 

And if she gave me grief about having a headache, and going to work late (within the rules of my job description), I'd laugh again. I'm no marriage expert, but I think you should get this stuff settled as early in your marriage as possible. If you keep letting it go on, it's just going to become normal. And this isn't normal. You're his equal. You can listen honestly to what he's saying, and give it consideration, but in the end what he's saying is just plain silly."
"Very annoyed. And after only three months it’s none of his concern if you get a dog.

"It could go one of two ways as far as I can see but I think given the history, option a is more likely. 

a) Triangulation is the term to look up for this one. They'll tell you one thing (without recording devices). Probably something about how you're being terrible to his future prospects or how he'll be kicked out of his community for not marrying a 'nice' indian girl. Something to upset you and force you to leave early. They'll tell your partner another. How you were rude and irate and caused an argument and accused them of all sorts of things. 

b) they appologize and are going to try to be good to you from now on. Maybe this happens in real life but not for most people that post about problems on the internet it seems.

If they go for the hostile option expect them to put pressure on your boyfriend. Don't go to dinner with them, only talk to them in writing so you have a trace / something to show your partner and make sure your partner continues to see how they will be acting."

"That is rape, OP.

I sae this exact behavior from someone I know to be a victim of rape and coerced sex acts. Your girlfriend is showing clear and recognizable patterns that any capable mental health professional should realize. 

She needs a psychiatrist or at least a psychotherapist. You mentioned she can't afford. Help her take an initial step by going to a mental health crisis center, a womens health center, a victims help group, her GP, or anywhere you can find a therapist who will work for sliding or reduced rates. Her college counseling center is unlikely to have anybody qualified enough to help, but they can at least refer her to others, and she needs to start hearing that she is acknowledged and deserves help without shame.

You are well-intentioned but really don't know enough to weigh in on this, and your comments can end up doing real harm. From now on, just tell her you support her and want to help her to get help. Don't offer any opinions because frankly, you're not qualified here."

"What a winner! Bed bugs, lack of remorse, immature, selfish, unclean, gross, expensive, vindictive, mismatched sex drive, won't get a STD test... but he's ""sweet"". \-.\-

Return the necklace and dump him. Invest all the wasted energy you're putting into fights and dealing with this jerk and put it into meeting friends"
He's defensive because he KNOWS you're right and doesn't want you to be. If he can't put in the work you should move... alone. And find a new boyfriend\- who actually pulls his own weight.
Maybe talk more to him about it rather than making bad assumptions.
"To be honest, I don't think this is the right approach.  You need to learn to acknowledge these thoughts, acknowledge the feelings that come with them, and learn to let them go.  You need to learn how to say to yourself ""yeah, that happened and it fucking sucks, but it's long gone and our relationship is much better now""."
"&gt;I dont care if it's your birthday, your not 10 anymore where people cater to your every whim because it's your special day.

"Childish is the key word here, this person is antisocial the way 3 years olds are. Good manners can be interpreted as a symbolic confirmation that a certain set of social capabilities has been acquired (i.e. understanding of context and selection of the appropriate behavior, collaboration with the group to the common effort of making everybody happy etc), which unfortunately is not the case for your boyfriend. 
I understand your parents’ embarrassment, particularly because Japanese culture is heroically sensitive in paying respect to otherness. I deeply sympathize with you for your disappointment, OP."
"Yeah I just talked with him about being more careful, but honestly it didn't seem to go through at all, because he feels like it's just an accident.
The sport suggestions are a good idea though. I know I became much more aware of how I moved after I started consistently practicing yoga."
Because he's dragging his work into his excuse for treating his wife like crap. If he's stating (which he essentially did) that he's treating his wife like he treats his students then he's a crappy husband and teacher. 
"Part of the big struggle in getting my mom to go to therapy or see a doctor about her mental health problems is that English is her second language and she is constantly insecure about explaining to a medical professional exactly what problems she has.

Plus the general taboo in Chinese culture against therapy or mental health services I guess. It's a constant battle with her."

Edit: Also the idea that she went from perfectly healthy, to inpatient rehab, to safe to live with a ten year old in a year or two. No out patient in between, no problematic drinking during the marriage, no dysfunctional behaviors that wrecked her marriage, nuked her relationship with her kids, and resulted in alcoholism. Nope. Instead an affair happened to her and then her ex was mean to her and she just had to give up her kids in favor of drinking copious amounts of alcohol.  Because he said mean things to her."

I don't mind him spending his money on toys. He's young. He's entitled. But here, at a very important crossroads, you two see to be going in different directions.

Why does he even want a sex doll when he has you, and he can't be bothered to be with you very often? 

I don't get it.

"This is a guaranteed way of making your relationship with her worse and your relationship with your husband worse, and for what? There's no guarantee at all it will make you feel better or she'll suddenly turn into you guys's relationship counselor/cheerleader.

"Yes this!! OP, I lived with an ex who has a kid. He expected me to watch his kid all the time while he went and did other stuff. Toward the end I knew he didn’t have feelings for me anymore, but I sure was a convenient free babysitter.  

Dating someone with kids is tricky. It wasn’t for me because I just don’t like spending that much time with kids.

I suggest you seriously reconsider if living together/having a serious relationship with this person is a good idea."

"1) Well, he has a point that he can't really make up for not sending stuff to you in previous years.  But what he CAN do is not make things worse by doing things for complete strangers that you are sensitive about him not doing for you, right in front of your face and with shared money.  He CAN kind of make up for past years by being really respectful and sensitive about this now. 

2) But I think it actually distracts from the main problem if you focus on tying this to what he does for you.  Because the main point to me is that his wooing this random girl with gifts and candy is freaking sketchy.  And that's exactly how this is coming off -- wooing a potential romantic interest.  Because otherwise you don't send gifts to a friend you met online a week ago.  If he wants to show that he's being a better friend to people, he should be starting with his actual friends that he's known for some time (but it's telling that he doesn't do this stuff for any male friends).  Let me guess: can he see pictures of this girl in the app?  Is he forming similar close relationships with any men on the app?  

3) I'm not sure where this leaves you now, because it sounds like you were guilted into telling him he could send the gift, and sounds like he's already sent it.

"They also have a shitload of money so they can afford to deal with all the things that could go wrong in a breakup with kids and shared assests (ie they can pay for lawyers, childcare, separate housing, plane tickets, etc). Most people need to get married to have the same security."

You are VERY young. You will regret it. "
"I know that. I don’t know, however, how he’s able to make a scene at his job and not face consequences. I have relatives who work in the legal system and that’s very surprising to me. I’m not shaming him; I’m shocked."

"If it helps, this sounds more like immaturity and poor decision making than being unbalanced. Obviously I agree this is effed up, get her away from your dogs, and report her. Change your keys! Just saying I think it’s probably just a dumb thing she’s doing and she’s going to be mortified to be called out. "
I think you should report it as a theft to the police. I don't think any action from you two will cause her to change. She needs to face legal ramifications for this. I'd also consider asking a lawyer to file a Cease and Desist letter to her.
And she just coincidentally chose to date someone your wife knows.
That is fucking insane. She robbed them of over a years worth of dinner!

"&gt; I want to clarify that we haven’t only been together six months. That’s just the length of our engagement so far.

How does that not mean anything but you were engaged for six months?  I know this isn't really the point of this post, but tbh it sounds like you're flip-flopping on the truth after people are even more appalled by dating for 2 months."

"I think either extreme is unhealthy. If you’re raised to think the world is for the taking, yup, that’s not good for you. But it’s also bad to be raised to think that wanting things, and expressing those wants, is not nice or good. "
"I entirely agree with you.

In my previous relationship, my SO made more money. Our ""fair"" was to pay proportionally what we make. I.e., if SO makes 60% of our combined income, and I make 40%, we'd split rent 60/40. He picked up most of our meals, and I'd pick up the other 30-40% of the meals. I also did house chores since he tended to work later (getting home after 7pm) whereas I was home by 4pm. We both were OK with this and worked hard where we could.

Now, in my current relationship, I make more money. I do the same thing I did with my previous relationship. Rent is split proportionally, and we try to split dinner/entertainment about 50/50 or 60/40 (where I pay 60).

I think OP needs to be OK with doing things proportionally rather than 50/50. If he isn't, that's OK too, but he'll need to find someone else who can afford the lifestyle he wants."
Would you be happy for your wife to talk to her colleague in the same way you’re doing with yours? 
"Yep. You do what's best for the dog. Sounds like he hasn't bonded with you guys, either. Give him another chance to find a family."
Seriously? If I were her parent I'd be thrilled that I'd be able to provide her a life where she's free to pursue whatever she wants instead of getting a job she doesn't care about to put a roof over her head. Unless seriously mismanaged a $30 million sum is not easily wiped out
"Is this your defense of the argument?

That's a logical fallacy.

But to answer your question - yeah, especially compared to such drastic age difference in relationships, in which male is much older.

That's a redflag, when a guy in his 40s is dating someone in her 20s."
"Eh, this is not ""sweet"". Sweet looks different. Sweet is caring too much about the *wellbeing* of people, animals, etc. Honestly, mate affection towards someone you don't know well should never be categorized anywhere near ""sweet"", there's really nothing sweet in having a crush on someone.

This is clingy and demanding and not acknowledging boundaries."
Lmao. Completely off topic to this post but the idea that you think Trump donating his salary is actually helpful is funny. The amount of money he’s removed in funding from those programs he “donates” to and the amount he’s spent in taxpayer money for Florida trips and golf games makes his salary donations pointless. 
"Not doing anything? She clearly has several passions that she says she's pursuing, despite the fact that they don't pay her a ton of money. I'm wondering what she could possibly see in him if he's so lazy that he won't even pursue a hobby or volunteer."

"&gt;Should I tell them I’m a company director and millionaire on like the first date?

Don't do this. While this would stop you from wasting time with guys who can't handle your situation, it would also invite extra attention from guys who are primarily interested in your wealth/lifestyle."
"Everyone that has kids seems to say that you have to power through the first 5 years and it really stresses the marriage specifically because at that age they require so much of your attention and focus, like you know just to keep them existing.

This family never left that stage, they always had babies and toddlers. And since the kids were packed so closely together it probably compounded the issue instead of gradually becoming easier."
Report this to the police immediately. This is statutory rape. Don't be friends with someone who commits statutory rape. 
"You went out of your way to explicitly call her ""not a bully"". In fact, this whole comment chain is about YOU disagreeing with someone calling her a bully... Then when someone disagrees with you, you go ""who cares about the label"""
"I honestly thought that about myself for a while. I was always the one breaking up with my significant others and it never seemed like for good enough reasons. I felt bad like I was nitpicky or..a commitment phobe. When I got older, I realized that those things weren't true. The truth is that I refuse to settle.  I simply refuse to stay with someone if I don't think they're right for me. The same might be true for you. Little doubts or noticing little red flags is your intuition telling you that they aren't right. What helped me was commitment free dating. Basically accepting that I was going to date for fun with no expectations and if I found that I was having doubts, I would break up with them. 
I ended up finding the right person soon after making that decision. "
"yeah it's true because people who don't live together before marriage are much more likely to be very religious. Very religious people tend to frown upon divorce and are more likely to stay in a bad marriage, either to please their god or out of fear for backlash from their community (family, church, friends)."
"I don't even know where to begin. Find what's left of your self esteem and take a stand. This is so far bonkers that I hope just typing it out and reading it back to yourself is an eye opener.

"Did she get any therapy or counseling after her father died? That could be part of the problem.

Another part of the problem sounds like it's just the logistics of transportation, which will get easier when she learns to drive. In the meantime, maybe you and she could do some extra legwork to see if she can find an alternate way to get to her club meetings. Carpool? Bus? Bike? Idk what the layout of your town is, but there might be some options available."
My husband has had some kidney stones that required surgical intervention.  He has never called me by anything else than my name in bed.  That is the weirdest god-damn excuse I've ever heard.

If he's conservative and doesn't support your ambition and your career track it's a relationship mismatch anyway. 

You deserve the job, and to not be criticized for your choices by someone who should be proud and inspired themselves. My husband works 60-80 hr work weeks(overtime and weird shift work) and I admire his efforts, but he comes right back with pride for me and what I do to make our life comfortable. We have a ""traditional"" split from his having the higher wages coupled with having kids pretty young, but there's no contempt for me and I'm planning to go back to work after retraining. So that's bullshit. Even when I was working half his hours for a third the pay, I still never once got sneered at. I have never been devalued as a partner on equal terms within our relationship.

"&gt;  So after the trip she remarked how surprised she was that my family didn't even know about the microwave/wifi/orange juice dangers.

Hmm, curious how you responded to that. Did you explain that orange juice and aspirin are not a lethal combination ? I guess I'm wondering how open your gf is to learning and accepting scientific facts. Like objectively, she knows your uncle is a surgeon and went to medical school for years and is working in the health field. He knows more than her on the subject. If he tells her that's not a thing, can she believe that? This could've been a good opening to gently let her know that her explaining health to a surgeon may come across as rude or unwanted. "
"Honestly, if that's the attitude that he's going to take, then you're better off. "
"If she had to deliver, that’s not a miscarriage, that’s a stillbirth, and it’s one of the most traumatic things that can happen to a woman. I think you need to act as though her child died, because that’s what happened. I have a friend who delivered her daughter stillborn at 24 weeks and they had a service for her. Whether or not your friend has a service, you should send her a heartfelt email and follow it up with a written note and flowers. "

"He wants to have two girl friends.  He's comfortable with her and is too open to her.  As long as he remains so emotionally tied to her, he's not leaving much room for your relationship to grow and mature.

Under the guise of friendship, he's casually dating her.  He doesn't think he's doing anything wrong.  In fact, he's setting the scene for an epic betrayal as he gets closer and closer to her in a non-sexual way.   

He's in such denial about the significance of his choices, I'm not sure you can explain this to him in a way that he will be able to understand.  You may just have to get out before he ends up hurting  you big time."

"&gt;He says having a brother-turned-dad gives the implicit vibe that he must have had sex with his own mother? He says this is what people will think of.

Ha, no, they won't. This isn't actually that rare; I have at least three friends who had similar arrangements. Families are weird sometimes, but as long as they support and love one another, they usually turn out OK. Your boyfriend is being immature and ridiculous, so pay no mind to him and go enjoy living with your dad :-) "
"She said in sickness and in health so now she has to contract a lifelong illness or else she's a bad wife? That's absolutely unreasonable. Herpes affects different people, well, differently. Not wanting to contract any form of it or another incurable disease is a pretty reasonable fear and I would be absolutely livid if someone with the disease did not respect that."
"You said she's told you many times over that she's unhappy, though. She's been with you since she was sixteen; she's said ""I'm unhappy"" and ""I have feelings for this other man"" and ""I want to be a woman as well as a mother."" Have you heard those feelings? Because this comment makes it seem like you've decided they're not valid.

You can decide for yourself that her treatment of you isn't good enough and you want to divorce her. You can decide that her feelings for another man mean you deserve better and you're leaving. But you can't decide her feelings for her. It wasn't a ""great marriage"" to her if she said ""I'm unhappy"" over and over again.

It sounds like the marriage you're fighting for wasn't the same marriage she's been in all this time."
"Exactly. I wasn't trying to time my pregnancy but I postponed a trip until my second trimester because that's supposed to be the easiest and the most energetic time. And then boom, bedrest for placenta previa. You can't really plan for these things, you can just hope for the best."

"I've been talking to his mom. I'm going to pick up more anti-itch meds for the dog (she's been gnawing and scratching at her skin) and then take her to his parents' house. His parents are leaving on their own vacation before my friend gets back, but at this point I'm leaning toward the idea that they can just figure it out themselves."
"My concerns are that 1) how you can possibly split everything 50/50 in the long run with such disparity in income, 2) he insists he'll help you in an emergency, and maybe he will, but there's no contingency if he doesn't, 3) he's right that prenups are standard, especially for high earners, but he's projecting a lot of negative bullshit onto you about ""getting screwed,"" which is really hurtful and not conducive to a negotiation like this, and finally 4) he's acting a bit like the prenup is *just* for him and his benefit and it's the leverage he has over you if you want to marry him. 

The prenup has to work for you, too. You're not a passive party that signs over her marital share simply for the privilege of marrying him. If you give up your marital share, it should be for something that doesn't leave you financially stranded. After all, if you plan to keep up this 50/50 lifestyle, he'll be saving and investing his extra income while you'll be spending a greater proportion of your income on the basics. You'll never be able to save and invest for your future if you're trying to keep up with his spending. So, it's really important that you get a lawyer and negotiate something that gives you some security."
"It's not really about entitlement on the part of the person who makes less.
If one person makes 60k a year, the recommendation is that they spend no more than about 1600 per month on rent / a mortgage.
The other person makes 10x that, so they could spend 16,000 per month on housing, which obviously the other person can't afford.

So if they're living together, it's either that the person with more money lives FAR below their means, when they probably would want to buy/rent a nicer place, or that person contributes a little more to housing costs.

Same goes for going out to eat/vacations. If you were making over half a million a year, you'd probably want to go to some nice restaurants, stay in nice hotels when you go on vacation, etc.

Obviously this situation is genderless, and applies whether it's the man or woman who is making more, and in a same-sex relationship"
I assume she's okay with both of you keeping your names? Just do that. She's seems fine with the idea of your family not all having the same name. 
You keep your name because it's your identity. Every argument to be made for women keeping their name can he made for you keeping yours. You're just going to have to get over your family all having the same name.

"Noooooope. Most of them either sell through traditional outlets (makeup counters at department stores, drugstores, specialty stores such as Sephora or Ulta) or online.

I did want to add something thought: When my bf talks to me about finances hes always makes it fun by taking me out to breakfast and us talking about it over coffee. its less formal and may make her feel more relaxed. Also, another thing that really helps is when he talks about finances he doesn't really use that word, he calls it 'planning for our future' and he talks about buying a house, retirement, costs of weddings, how much to set aside before we have kids and how much the Labrador retriever I want so bad will cost. Bringing up what you want to do for your future TOGETHER and how much things will cost may make her take a look at her own spending without you having to even bring it up.  "

"Well it’s time to involve the bride and have her tell your sister, in no uncertain terms, that she doesn’t want all of these things. I get not wanting to rope the bride in, but if your sister isn’t listening to you then the bride needs to say something to shut it down. 

But I’ll add...how much lower is your budget compared to everyone elses? A middle ground needs to be found here. I’d be a little annoyed if I was expecting a fun weekend away and was told all we were doing was hanging in an Air BnB because one person out of the group didn’t want to spend the money, but still insisted on attending.

"I feel terrible for your husband. He followed you overseas, where it can be hard for a civilian partner to find work when they are just temporarily living in a place and without their home support system, and he managed to find a job as a temporary foreigner without a network or any friends (you don't say if you are in a country where English is the primary language, but that is an additional burden if so). He did all of this in support of your career and you are already thinking of dropping him? You find it unattractive that you are the primary breadwinner, and yet I presume were at least partially responsible for putting him in this position? 

One person having to sacrifice and put their career and life on hold to follow their active duty partner around the world so that military partner can advance their career is very, very common. It sounds as if he even left a flourishing active duty career so you could be together. Are you appreciative at all?"
" “You seemed really into it"" is bullshit, as I'm sure you know. He wanted something, so he took it, violating your wishes and body autonomy and putting you at risk in the process. This is not how a good partner treats you. This isn't even how a sort of okay partner treats you. He doesn't care about you, plain and simple. Please get out of this relationship with this dangerous guy. "
"“If you love someone, let them go. And if they come back to you, it means they couldn’t do any better.”"

"Yes, aware that he will look bad if that's his only reason for demanding to get his way. All I can read is ""how do I get this without looking sexist"", especially since he didn't even bother to mention *why* his wife wants to hang onto her current last name."
Yes but you didn't say it to her. She's being rude to you in your own home - why put up with that? 
The lack of communication is bigger than the issue with the sex life. It's a symptom of a much bigger problem. What about other issues coming up? Is he going to shut you out forever? This is no way to live your life.
"Your boyfriend's family treats you perfectly well. Not like a side piece. It sounds like you want to have one on one relationships with them, and the reality is that doesn't happen in a lot of relationships. In a lot of families, the partner still does the majority of the communication with their in-laws (and vice versa) via the family member they are involved with. 

You seem to be in the market for friends still, but it's likely that Jenna has an established group of friends already. You two clearly get along and are friendly, but most adults only have so much bandwidth to cultivate new friendships. You should consider putting more effort into meeting new people other ways, and stop over thinking your relationship with your partner's family. It's not as close as you want, but it's fine. You can't force them to want to hang out one on one with you. "

"Don't let that comment discourage you. You're doing the right thing and a compatibility talk is in no way an incentive to propose when you haven't made it clear that you want him to propose within the next years/months. You will change a lot while gaining financial independence and living on your own and if you two are a good fit it won't matter if you wait a few years down the road anyway. 

A proposal should never be a surprise (... Ofc the actual proposal can be a surprise during a romantic moment or whatever but it should be agreed upon that it is coming in a certain time frame).  "
"This kind of thing is more common than you think. Usually the baby is raised with his/her mother and grandparents (thinking mother is sister). Your brother showed a lot of maturity in choosing to have you raised with him and his parents. 

This is a *good* situation. You have all of these people who love you and care about you and want to parent you. Sure, there was a secret and that's got to be a shock, but there's nothing sick about it. And it's totally appropriate for you to move in with your dad. Your boyfriend is imposing his own weirdness and neuroses onto a situation and trying to make an unusual situation into a twisted and wrong situation, and it just isn't that.  That makes him a bit toxic. No one is going to think the things he's thinking--he has to take responsibility for bringing those weird thoughts into the situation when there's no reason to think those things. You have to give him an ultimatum--he needs to start being supportive of you and stop thinking crazy thoughts and trying to make other people think crazy thoughts, or else you're breaking up with him.  If he is just there to make the situation worse, then he's a toxic influence."
"It's a big deal.  A huge red flag, IMO.  I don't think you are overreacting.  First he grabs you and blocks your way, how long until he graduates to one ""accidental smack"" that he ""totally didn't mean"".  He only did it because ""you got him so fired up"".  

He's not remorseful of what he did.  He's already trying to gaslight you by saying it wasn't a big deal.  He's wrong.  It is."
"Yeah, so your boyfriend is the only one who tells you these things, and other people are telling you, you dress too formally sometimes. You definitely have nothing you worry about, especially if you don't wear low-cut shirts. 

It wouldn't be embarrassing to friends. I've had friends physically pull up my shirt if it rode down, and put my bra strap back on my shoulder if it fell down. They didn't even tell me, they were comfortable enough to do it themselves. 

You can also ask your friends if they think you show too much skin sometimes, or if they notice that if you move or bend a certain way, if they can see too much of your body. If they are embarrassed to tell you, asking them would get rid of that embarrassment since they're not just telling you out of the blue, you're asking them to tell you. 

Your boyfriend has completely sexualized you and your body. You definitely are not showing too much skin, but if anything you wear compliments your body shape and makes you look good, he has a problem with it. He doesn't want to say this to you directly, so he makes it your fault by saying you show too much or that you flash people so you dress how he wants. I reiterate that he is incredibly insecure and most definitely incredibly controlling. He's more than willing to lie to you about how you dress because he knows you're insecure about not being mindful and don't want too much of your body to show. This also makes him manipulative; he's playing on your insecurities to make you do what he wants. "

She wants to control you and upset you, and if you give her a fight, it's exactly what she wants. Just tell her that it was a pretty fucked up thing, so she's not welcome to stay at your house anymore (or maybe even visit, depending on what you and your wife decide). After that, keep enforcing the boundaries and dial your communication way way back, and let her drift deeper into her senior years as a lonely old bastard."
"I am a female and I get excited when I make a make a new female friend or just a new friend bc as an adult sometimes making real friends is extremely difficult. It may feel like a crush now but sounds like you might have made a friend that could be a good friend so just don't ruin it for her or you with confusing those feelings. Keep yalls hanging out to work time and don't hit on her. She's in a relationship, so are you and you're her coworker. If you can't be her friend then end it but dont hit on her."

I'd be inclined to word the second stage along the lines of, ""I couldn't finish it because I've got a mental block about graphic stuff about people I know, but I'm sure people who are more removed from you will love it."" Adding the personal element would make it sound a bit less ""judge-y about erotica per se,"" and therefore less awkward IMO."

How do you intend to keep people from imposing if you don't want anyone to fell like they're imposing? You can only do one of the two.

"“Do you think you being like X is helpful in this situation” is condescension. You get that, right? You’re treating your girlfriend who’s been parenting for 8 times as long as you have like she needs to learn how to parent from you. "
"Coming at this as both a person who's lived with anxiety and depression my entire adult life and someone who's about to celebrate the 40th anniversary of my first date with my husband. Yeah, it's normal for things to settle down in a relationship once the two of you get to know each other well. A good, healthy relationship isn't based on fireworks and drama. It's based on genuine affection and respect. Libido comes and goes, but libido isn't really at the core of a good relationship. The love and regard that you have for each other and the life you live together is. That said, there are a lot of ways to spice things up in the sex department, starting with communicating what turns you on with him and/or trying new things in the bedroom.

Honestly, though, as wonderful as sex is,  it shouldn't be the basis for a long\-term relationship. The best memories I have of my life with my husband aren't about the great sex we've had. They're about the everyday things we've done together. Travels, parenting our son, rescuing our cat, moving from one house to another, even just movies and music we've enjoyed together. 

We have hit the occasional rough patch, and we've seen a counselor when we did. If talking to your boyfriend frankly about what you want and expect in your relationship doesn't net you the results you want, maybe the two of you talking to someone will. If the thought of leaving him makes your heart ache, there's definitely something there that's worth preserving. And turbulence in a relationship isn't good. The best to both of you!"

"&gt; (what most people fail to realize is that rings made back in that period are gorgeous and the styles are reused by current jewellers to sell ""vintage"" styles. So in theory the ring itself is fine and ignore the commenters.

That absolutely is only your opinion. I've seen equally as many posts on this subreddit where a woman goes ""help! My boyfriend proposed with his family's heirloom ring but it's a godawful style I wouldn't be caught dead in, what do I do?"" or ""My boyfriend proposed with the family heirloom ring but I'd prefer a new engagement ring we choose together, how do I express this to him w/o hurting his feelings?"" 

Now OP knows his gf better than we all do so I can only speculate. Maybe it *is* her style. Maybe she doesn't want to get a new one to symbolize anything about their relationship. In which case I'd still do what one of the top comment suggests and somehow ""split"" the ring, ie the stone goes to one and the setting goes to another. 

As much as it *is* up to the person who owns the thing, you gotta admit it's pretty unfair that the sister expressed desire for an heirloom and interest in a family thing only to be snubbed because of something out of her control. If OP can compromise on this, I would, but before that, he'd better check to see if his gf is actually on board with this whole thing, lest she show up here a couple months from now.   "
"It feels like a red flag alert because his parents don't like you deep down? I don't get the reasons of you weren't welcome. Like nothing to be mad about but they did. In addition, he wasn't even on your side. I would say you should leave and find someone else. "
Does your mom know the details of what was in it? If so I can certainly see why she’s upset. I wouldn’t be shocked if “you’re a shit parent” was part of how he justified his abusive behavior. Hearing you thank him while telling him that he was right ... ouch. I’d feel like you were justifying my abuse if I were her even if you explicitly said hitting her was bad. It comes of as very “you took it a bit far but I totally get why”.  It also comes off very “sorry I thought beating my mom was sufficient reason to hate you I don’t think that way anymore”
"&gt;When I'm having a medical emergency, my husband is always there, holding my hand, making me feel calm and safe, and helping me in any way he can, on a personal level. It's one of the things I love most about him, but rationally speaking, I just don't think he'd be the best proxy for me.  I feel like my husband is there for support, and my mom is there for logistics, to keep tabs on my treatment team, make sure she always has the latest information, and to always ask ""What are our options?""

You have already laid out your reasoning.  He's there for emotional and moral support.  Your mom is the general planning the battle.  

You will want to discuss it with each one separately, and then together to talk about what kinds of decisions you need him to be involved in and which ones can be her ""property"" so to speak."
"Another tactic you could try with your mom is ""Mom, me going to therapy is about me, not about your parenting. If I wanted you to do something differently, I would tell you - for example, right now I'm asking you to stop asking what my therapy is about, because you're stressing me out."""
"I guess I understand your fiancee not wanting you to interact with her but I agree that requiring you to quit your job before you get married is unreasonable. It sounds like you've got a really good thing going there, and your very limited interactions with your ex are hardly a reason to throw that away. If you had to talk to her daily or spend any significant amount of time together then sure, but that's clearly not the case. "
Do not have a kid with this man. He would do jack shit to help you.
"IDK I mean I think it's one of those white lies that most people are ok with. It sucks that she couldn't have just been like 'I don't feel like chilling with you tomorrow, I might do something with so-and-so instead' but I don't think it's really right to get that upset over. 

It sounds like the purchase was an honest mistake and not really relevant to why you're upset. Like for all you know she went to Mcdonalds on a study break, not on a day-long hangout purposefully excluding you. "
"I appreciate honesty greatly but.... There's absolutely no reason to hurt someone like that. No reason he needed to say that. I am pretty confident in myself but that would hurt me too and I don't think I could continue a relationship with someone who definitely isn't perfect himself.

Love your body, girl. Physicalities only matter so much to GOOD people. Your breast size doesn't matter, I promise. "
"Oh, and does he keep his shirt on the whole time he's at the beach? Or are you the only one who has to cover up?"
"Teasing you about having competition is probably him looking for you to show some jealousy, like you're appreciative and protective of what you have. Are you complimenting him on his new self-discipline, or is it possible he senses that you're resentful or unsupportive? He's happy with the way his health is moving, and he wants you along for the ride. If he's not doing anything to encourage other women to pursue him, he obviously still wants to be with you. People who have struggled with bodily self-esteem issues in the past need a lot of validation, especially at the beginning. Getting hit on makes him feel attractive, which is a novel concept for him. Make sure you're doing the same, even though you were attracted to him when he was a lanky dude. "
"&gt; ""Technicalities"" don't really mean much in actual relationships with human emotions. 

This! I can't believe the amount of comments that are like, ""well she fucked up so she gets to live with the consequences"". It's not even the point. If OP is so concerned about being ""right"" this marriage is going to be a disaster."

"You sound like an ingrown toenail of a person. OP has her own life and she’s in no way responsible for her MILs life and emotions. If you check her comments, their marriage was on the rocks prior to his passing, and they stayed together for the daughter. 
Also, in no universe should she be expected to provide her MIL with a place to live for the rest of her life. Her MiL is an adult, and should be able to provide for herself. "
"Listen to this OP.  Also, see if you can find some old timers in long marriages to talk to. Get some perspective. "
Yes it should be his decision whether he wants to be with a person who could do that.
"Well, if he's happy to see her go, then it sounds like she's well shot of him.  "
"I come from a similar situation.  Dad cheated on mom.  Decided to go off and marry another women.  Mom remained bitter (and still is).  Dad constantly accused Mom of trying to prevent our relationships.

Some things I noticed.  

1)  Your mom is bitter and it's probably affecting her.  I'd say my mother is the same and yes, she wasn't the best of parents for it.  In a way, I still resent my mother for that.

2) Your Dad is an ass.  What stood out the most is that your dad did not pay child support or try to reach you. It's easy and takes no effort to passively try to phone you once in a while and say sweet things (I.e. ""I missed you"", stuff about being a dad, etc).  But it's another thing to actually sacrifice for you (I.e. like child support).  

Ironically enough I was willing to ""forgive"" my father for being a deadbeat (my stepmother also added me on Facebook - to my mother's dismay).  Which was a huge mistake for me. Turns out he was a fairweather parent. When I became ill and needed surgery and expensive medical care - guess who disappeared again.  

The one who was willing to actually help was my mom. I suppose then I understood why she was bitter - she wouldn't have had to sacrifice so much if he wasn't a deadbeat.

3) 

&gt;Dad, on the other hand, is overflowing with joy because he will be GrandDad for the first time. I have absolutely no beef with him. I wish he had been more present especially on my teenage years. 

Of course he was.  If he's like my dad, he's happy to have all the fun and bragging rights without having to sacrifice anything. My ""Dad"" was overjoyed when I graduated as an engineer, got offers for medical school and got accepted into a high end grad school.  But when I needed help with tuition - guess who disappeared again. (Mom meanwhile put off her dental care to afford to be able to help me)

What I recommend

 - ask your mom for proof about his stories next time.  I did that and it turns out they both sucked as parents.  It also helped me sort through all that bull crap. 

 - Keep your mom on an information diet about your Dad and encourage her to get help.  Seriously, just don't talk to her about him. Focus on her relationship with said kid not his.

 - confront your dad about not paying child support or fighting for you.  Also about the affair details. Watch his responses.  That will tell you a lot about his character.  

 - Let your dad earn your trust back.  Don't accept him as ""Dad"" or ""Grandpa"" straight away. I made the mistake of doing this. If I had watched his actions, I would have realized exactly who he was.

Edit:

Another thing, I'd recommend prioritizing the parent who will be more helpful. (You don't have to choose that now, nor does that mean you have to cut the other out). If you or your wife get sick and have to spend some time in the hospital - which parent would drop everything to come babysit?

Edit 2:

&gt;You are really projecting your own issues. OP has made peace with his dad, you are determined to keep digging up old history.

The actual irony is that I had someone else tell me something similar to what I posted when I reached out to my dad.  My response was pretty much exactly the same  as this comment. I really ate my words.  (Really this edit is just a remember for me to show her it )"
"He was rude and selfish, rather than apologizing he's trying to put the blame on you and say you should have just sat around waiting for him for hours. LOL no. Get out!"
"Sounds like you're an empath and as such you must work hard to guard your heart and mind. Folk will naturally gravitate to you for assistance. You must set boundaries, learn to say no and\or help and walk away. Get counseling or find books to help. This is my issue as well "
"I’d be flattered, it seems like a nice thing to do. I’m assuming you’ve been together for a while and you didn’t just wake up in her house with no memory surrounded by these pictures. "
"I think you handled it all right, you have been sensitive about his issue and he is not returning that same respect and sensitivity. Adding in that manipulative ""he hates people that drink"" and the fib about how you said you wouldn't is very shabby. If he has a preference in his relationship then that is not a loving and respectful way to express it.

But at the end of the day, it might be hard to reach a compromise with someone that has such a black and white worldview around drinking. But it might be worth exploring what's going on in his head, because it sounds like this is a new reaction, since you were comfortable enough letting him know what you were up to and surprised about his reaction."
"Resist the temptation to win back your ex. It will only end in tears - yours.

You’re looking back with rose-coloured glasses, pining for something that’s not there. 

Jealousy can make you crazy and there will be no winners. Your child will be caught in the middle and suffer.

Take a look at r/stepparents for a taste of the crazy that the BM’s (biological mothers) pull on their ex’s new partners. It never ends well. 

I’m a stepmother and the crazy that my husband’s ex has shown over the years has been just so embarrassing... for her. She’s always using their kid to contact us, throw shade on me, undermining our relationship, boasting, starting petty fights... it’s pathetic. Don’t be like her.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Get counselling, change your mindset, realise it wasn’t meant to be and move on. It won’t be easy, but it’s the right thing to do by your child and yourself."

"I get that it's a game, but I feel like other commenters aren't recognizing that sex workers DO get murdered at higher rates than the general population. It's so common that ""dead hookers"" have become trope in fiction. They're treated like they're disposable. I don't care if this means I don't have a sense of humor. ""Jokes"" about dead sex workers just mock and victim blame women who are in a dangerous, desperate situation in life. 

Your bf clearly wasn't thinking about it. The joke is old as fuck and a total cliche. There's no way he came up with it himself. I don't know of that helps you come to a decision, but I would be more forgiving if I knew my SO was just parroting a stupid joke rather than having that idea themselves..."
"The only answer worth reading.

If you don't report her, next time she will kill someone.  That is a death you could have on your conscience if you don't at least try. And that would be just another way she would be hurting you. Don't give her that power.

Tell the police. ASAP!

Also, 'no' is a great answer if they bug you about your car.  'No' and 'Hang up'.

You are letting your “best friend” sexually harass and assault your girlfriend. You are a terrible boyfriend. He is a terrible person.

I feel like 'accidentally' is not the correct term. You can't accidentally reveal something. He had poor impulse control. Is that forgivable? Yes. But he needs to drop the 'accidentally' bit and own it.
"True, but the wedding is a big, stressful, expensive event that some people turn into a full time job. If OP’s fiancé wants one of these big, stressful, expensive parties but doesn’t want to help plan or pay for it, then that’s a preview of the kind of partner he will be. He wants all of the fun parts without doing any of the behind the scenes work, even when his future wife asks him to help her. He also won’t stand up to his mother when she is being blatantly rude. "

"Honestly, I think these are two separate questions:  should you postpone the proposal due to financial reasons and the separate question of should you propose at or directly after her graduation. 

Don't propose at her graduation. Don't propose at any party in honor of her graduation. Let her have her moment, and keep the celebration about her achievement. 

The second issue in regards to finances...I mean, it's always a good idea to wait until things are financially sound, but you can have a long engagement if you want. It's not like you propose and then you get married the next week. She should have time to find a job during the engagement, unless you think she'll go full tilt into wedding planning and not be securing a job in that time, in which case yeah you should probably wait."
Her partner is bisexual. Does this mean NONE of his friends can ever talk to him about kinks?
"&gt; I think you are misunderstanding the role of a health care proxy.

"Yes, and this goes double in certain types of industries or jobs. Among the many women I know who work in tech (at least in engineering roles) who took even a year off after having a kid, I know exactly 1 who ever got another career-track job again. For that reason, even if I'd been *losing* money by working when my child was a baby, I would not have considered staying out of the workforce, because the long-term cost to my career would have been greater than any temporary financial mismatch between salary and daycare.

Obviously this may be a different situation for a woman who has never had a paid career, or for someone who works retail or another minimum/lower-wage job. "
"There is a difference between being a friend and being a dependent. Mounting the TV, spraying for bugs, etc. are things she genuinely might have difficulty doing herself. Having him sign checks so she can pay bills?  No. Not reasonable. She can manage her own finances like a grownup. 

Also, calling him while you’re out of town just to chastise him for not rearranging his plans to do her a favor on her terms is downright bratty. She is not entitled to anyone’s time if she is not paying them. If she absolutely needed it done that weekend, she could have called an exterminator. 

It sounds like your boyfriend needs to evaluate what he’s getting out of that friendship and decide whether it is worth negatively affecting his relationship with you."
"What do you expect her to do? Walk away from her friends just because they're talking to some flirty guys? It's beach volleyball. Jumping up and down is part of the game. Women are allowed to have fun without constantly worrying about their boobs bouncing around.

Once crunch time is over, you can see a divorce attorney and talk over how to get this massive mooch out of your life. The husband problem will still be there in a few weeks and house can deal with that then. Buckle down and maintain your focus and your mental health as well as you can, in the meantime.

"Exactly! ""Lol, what would you do if..."" is *not* the way to have a serious conversation with someone you already know to have strong opinions on the topic!

"There's no reason you should have to divulge a personal problem to anybody just to reassure them that it's not related to them. 

Your boyfriend sounds insecure and might think you're talking to the therapist because you don't trust him, or he might just be skeptical of mental health professionals in general. If you told him you ""won't tolerate it"" but he continues to tease you about it, what are you going to do? Break up with him? There needs to be actions behind your words or he isn't going to take it seriously.

Re: your mom, maybe you could invite her to a session when you've found a regular therapist to talk about her feelings about it and maybe about any underlying problems causing her reaction? I think she might just feel out of the loop about her daughter's life which can be distressing."
Thank you. I will keep saying this.
"&gt; 1) I know that I hurt you and I am sorry that I did

This is unbelievably wrong. Your boyfriend is angry at you because of what someone else did.  Your ex visited. This is not something bad that you did.

"This whole situation sounds extremely toxic. My best advice (from a 19f who use to date plenty of older deadbeats) your only chance at a decent life it to get out and move on from him. My last boyfriend relied on me for income, despite the fact he was 5 years older and I had just gotten into college, I ended up having to drop out just to take care of us. The best thing that ever happened to me was a sudden burst in physical maturity because once I stopped looking like a child, he stopped having sexual feelings towards me and pushed me away enough that I finally got out. Your boyfriend was attracted to you as a 14 year old for a reason, and as much as you might not like to hear it, that reason is probably because he's a pedophile. Based on his lack of high school and job, I'd also like to add that he's unmotivated and you probably aren't going to have a progressive life with him if you stay. But best of luck, hopefully you make the right decision. "

That didn't know what kind of person she was. That's what felt isolating if that makes sense?

"Well, and if she's listening to her mom about this stuff, is she actually taking birth control, or is mom having her take some special concoction that ""is better than that poison""?  Or if using condoms and a condom breaks, what then?  I'd be terrified to leave a child in gf's care, even more so leaving a child in her mother's care.

I'm also having trouble ""getting"" why someone who is educated, and has an educated family, would be interested in someone who not only believes this stuff, but has the nerve to try to ""help"" by bringing up the pseudoscience."

One more day isn't going to make that big of a difference, and you can understand he might want to make sure the product is truly defective before going through the hassle of sending it back, getting the new one, and bothering several people about it along th

This isn’t his desk. It’s none of his business and OP didn’t ask for help. He was being controlling.

"Is it possible to get HR involved and hold a staff meeting about how to channel grief or to have counselors present? If you phrase it to HR as not wanting to send out any inappropriate messages at work, but feeling like this is affecting the workplace may get them involved.

" I will say it sounds to me like he's a little more frustrated at the *reasons* behind his gaming ban rather than the ban itself. 

I game a lot, and I can put it down for a length of time no problem. But if someone forced me to quit because of some nonsense ""You're depressed and need to be medicated and I'd rather you go heavy drinking than video game"" bullshit, I'd be pissed as fuck.

OP does need to tough this one out and just figure out what he can do to kill the time, because he agreed to those terms. But I would hesitate to be 100&amp;#37; sure it's an addiction, for those reasons."
"Why is it that men think everything in a marriage is theirs and that women are ""taking"" it?  When you marry, the stuff is only 50% yours.  If you are too selfish to handle that, don't legally bind yourself to someone.

"The thing she needs is for you to take your addiction seriously. You have to do it for you, and not to win her back.

Your commitment to these questions is the grand gesture that I would want.

Do it bro. Do it for you. 

EDIT: note to OP that I did not write in this message that you needed to go to rehab. I wrote that you need to take your addiction more seriously. That stands. Why aren’t you in some kind of formal accountability/healing structure/process?

He's  finally admitted that he was in denial about his feelings and is clear that he wants to work on his marriage as well as himself.  Don't be so harsh, he's beating up on himself enough."
"There's also the fact that she still seems to be pretty in love with OP, from his description.

If he were to leave her for the sake of the kids, she could end up going from indifferent towards them to hating them and blaming them for her losing her husband. Which would be incredibly bad if they had 50/50 custody.."

"I’m just going to add this in.... getting engaged doesn’t mean you need to get married *right away*... I’ve been engaged for nearly 2 years and will be getting married in August this year. Your engagement can go as long as you want it to. For me being engaged is a promise of what will be not a *you have to get married right away* thing... also I loved wearing the ring so people knew that I was taken and his promise to me. 

However if you feel like you’re not ready... then don’t let anyone pressure you into it. I’m just saying there are people who dont get married for years after being engaged. There is no rush. 

Moving in prior though would be a good idea... you don’t really know someone unless you live with them 24/7.... you see them at every stage of their life and then it’s up to you to decide if you want to stay and deal with it or think it’s not for you. 

Good luck. "
"&gt;I would love to not have to deal with Dave at all, but he is Corey's biological father. I feel responsible for making a decent effort to help them have a relationship. Am I wrong? How do I handle this?

Do you have a formal support agreement with Dave?  If not, why not?  Don't say *you* don't need anything, support is for the child.   I don't see why you would get involved with Dave at all without clearing that up first.

Also Brett is right, Dave is essentially a stranger to your son and you have let him take over, coming over to the house while in an intoxicated state.  Why?  It's okay to say that it might be good for Corey to know his biological father but you seem to have ceded all common sense in the process.

See a lawyer and get a formal support and custody agreement first.   Dave will probably disappear again once he knows that seeing Corey will require him to meet some minimal responsibility.

EDIT:  When you petition for child support, ask for back payments too."
"I have a feeling, just by the way you worded your post, that this isn’t the first time your DIL feels you’ve  crossed boundaries.

"How long will she grieve for? How long is a piece of string? She needs professional help, and fast. "
"Yes I have. But they were also boxed up due to lack of space in my old place. So while she heard how much they meant to me, I guess with them being out of sight, it never fully clicked just how much the collection meant. When I moved into my new place shortly before going away, I had a room with a few tables where I spread them all out before I went away. When I came back to see those tables empty and shelves in another room, I feel like part of me died. "
Depends on how long it takes them to distribute books they acquire. They might still have them. I would call them immediately.

Yea! Save some for the rest of us!
You think that losing your parents is something that just goes away?
"That sounds really sweet and generous! I'll just add some topics of conversation should be open ended- ask how she's been feeling, then say you've missed being intimate- ask if she's missed it too. She's getting quite pregnant but should be out of the constantly tired/nauseous phase, but probably entering the ""omg I'm getting huge"" part and might not be comfortable with her body which can definitely affect mood. Additionally there are hormones to contend with- her body is probably thinking ""oh we are fulfilling our biological imperative, no need for sex"" so she's not getting the same raw physical desire, but sometimes that can be overcome (i.e., I'm not a morning person but my SO knows that if he spends a little extra time gently waking me up, brings me coffee in bed and feels me up in all the right nonsexual-but-affectionate ways I will be in the mood pretty quick. In fact, I highly recommend morning sex- you can have a piece of each other before the demands of the day have a chance to wear you down physically and mentally!)

Assure her you still find her very attractive and how loved you feel when you do have sex, then come up with some kind of plan (""if I/we want to make time for sex, is there anything I could be doing that I'm not to help you get in the mood?"") for you two to tackle the issue together! It might be as unsexy as scheduling time- a day she hasn't had to work, or maybe you do more of the chores so she has the energy, you might end up feeling like you're ""working for it"" but at the same time she's building a human so she's ""working"" on another project 24/7. You sound open minded and considerate so I'm sure there won't be an issue as long as you can get an answer as to why she's not been in the mood and if there is something you can do. 

Obviously mileage will vary depending on her answers but as long as you're being sensitive to her reasons and she's open about why and also you're both open to compromise, hopefully it works out!"
"hey. i'm a lesbian, i'm your age. you're amazing and you will survive this. you have not sinned by existing and loving and being yourself. you haven't sinned by loving other women. your parents are not good people and they're completely wrong here. there might be no addressing their homophobia. you can live an amazing life in spite of all of that.

if you ever need an ear from someone who's a lesbian, the same age as you, i'll offer mine willingly. there will come a time one day when you will live your truthful life, and that's going to be amazing. you are worthy of love, i promise. there will be girls who will love you for who you are. there's a whole world ahead of you. i promise."
"The real aggravating part of this, to me, is that you've been telling him for four years now that you're taking this trip and every time you mention it he brushes you off by saying ""that's cute"". How condescending can you get? Did he just straight up think you're not capable of doing something like this or what? I would not be able to put up with that kind of attitude from any man (or woman if you want to split hairs).

And on that note, he doesn't get to whine about not being included in a trip which a) he was a total jerk about not believing you would pull off, and b) is to a place he wouldn't normally want to go to anyway and wouldn't enjoy. That's not even touching on the fact that this is a sibling trip and having your bf there would definitely cramp the dynamic. 

In short, your boyfriend is a butt. "
Maybe she grew up with or with someone that always questioned her about her bruises (if she bruises easily). She might be in the habit of explaining it because she’s always been asked. I personally don’t think it’s that weird. I always told my SO when I had a narly bruise so that he didn’t worry about me. Plus I knew that he was going to ask anyway. 
"She *wakes you up to chat?!?* That’s utterly insane to me, and disrespectful of your literal health and well-being. It sounds like you figured out how to shut that down on days you work, so you need to do whatever you did then but apply it to all days. 

In general, just talk to her, you’ve been together for 5 years, plenty long enough that you should have long since developed a communication style that allows you to discuss problems without it feeling like an attack. If you don’t have this, a couples counselor or therapist can help you develop it, and you both need to see one together, stat. This is clearly unsustainable for you. "
That is a beautiful response
"Who's idea was the swinging? If it came from your side she might think you find her uninteresting and sexually boring and she is trying to grasp your interest, and not letting go of what she thinks it is you ultimately want. 

Now the boundaries have been crossed and there is mixed communication. You two need to talk it out and you need to ask your wife about her actions. Also-does the other couple know you wanted to stop? If not-another miscommunication. Maybe just not hang out with the couple again."

YOU ARE NOT OVERREACTING. NOT EVEN A LITTLE. And the fact that he said you were is one of the most suspicious parts. 
"I think it depends on the ten year old and their access to resources. When I was ten I watched my baby brother (7years younger than me) alone for like 5 hours at a time some days. It wasn't often but I did, but we also had a home phone to call if there was an emergency, and my parents had cell phones, and I knew CPR and the heimlich manuever and was responsible enough to never break house rules-only cook in the microwave if parents are gone, never answer the door to anyone etc- my brother is now 15 and my brother is still not responsible enough to watch himself for more than a few hours(but he does have some special needs) . So I do think it is largely dependent on the child. "

"Also, for the sake of your husband's mental health, please let him know that although you cannot help being mad at him right now, this will pass. He certainly feels bad about it, and remember that he is in the same stressful situation as you."
"&gt;Overall, I feel like he wants me to ""keep up with the Joneses"" and look good in front of his friends and family. And he cares more about that then about the fact that I'm happy with the things I own, and with my lifestyle.

The two of you are not financially compatible in the long term."
"I definitely see this as well. OP I think you should take this into consideration since there’s never been funny business and he’s always kept her at a distance. Also, I’ve sometimes tried to shield myself and make myself look better by telling people that I wasn’t nearly as drunk as I was. The story changing and shower is strange, but from the sounds of it, she’s always been predatory. "
"Right? Sounds like the perfect adult role model to guide still-developing teens through their mistakes and assist them in their academic growth.    
Not."
"I think some people are missing the point in trying to figure out if you 'cheaped out'.

I don't believe for a second that it's a coincidence your fiancee no longer likes the ring. She expected a certain amount of money to be dropped on it, period. The issue, IMO, then becomes more about values and compatibility.

She wants a ""nice ring"" and if she's the type to have expensive taste, as you said she is, then she's likely to have this sort of attitude towards other areas of life. She'll want the nice ring. The nice car. The nice house. But what about you? Are you okay with that? Some guys are all about spoiling the woman in their life, and there's nothing wrong with that so long as both parties are about that. If you're more ""practical"" and don't like spending as much that may create problems down the line.

You're gonna have to talk with your fiancee about these kinds of things. Like what her expectations are, etc. "
"So.  Offer to go. Tonight.  Her reaction will tell you everything you need to know...

“Hey. Since this guy made you so uncomfortable last time, I’m going to go with you to make sure he stays professional and he doesn’t get weird.”   

Any professional gig would have zero problem with you there, just like her class had no problem with it...

 I  can almost guarantee you’re not invited... which should be all you need to know. "
"I don't think people are insulting you? I think they are just telling you to respect yourself, and that you deserve better. Sometimes tough love is the best love. I think you realize what he is doing isn't okay? Sometimes what is glaring obvious to an outsider, a person in the situation might be blind too. So people are just trying to shake you out of it.

Edit: I just saw your post history. You knew a month ago you were in an emotional abusive relationship with a cheating narcissistic. You said it yourself. What answers are you looking for here? "
"I like the idea of asking for family time. If you’re alone or just with the child you can also say “I'd really like to be alone with my thoughts right now, this is my quiet time.” She will get the hint, she understood what your husband said about family time. If she returns the next day: “Please understand, I’m out here to enjoy quiet time on the porch in the fresh air, this is my time for meditation/recharging.” This is a polite as you can be while still letting her know you want to be left alone. Practice saying it out loud until it sounds more natural. 

Directly ask her to leave you alone on the porch if she keeps returning, but I think most people only need to be told about your much needed “quiet porch time” once or twice. I very much understand that you don’t want to seem rude, and there’s no reason to be blunt unless she proves to be the kind of the person who needs things to be spelled out clearly."
What happens when you point out his hypocrisy?
"Yeah the 'nowhere' part would definitely be my hill to die on. It seems like he had every intention to lie about it but then realized his GF has a brain. The lack of communication on his side is very wrong. 

Most people would be flipping a shit/scared if their partner said 'I'll call you for a ride when I'm finished up' and didn't make contact till the next morning. "
Try NOT to be around her. Cut her loose. She's not a good thing in your life.
"People aren't always rational or open to understanding things from another person's point of view. She has an irrational and unfair idea of what you are allowed to do with your own body, in your own home. 

You can do your best to explain everything from the OP and your comments, and no matter how calmly, eloquently, and respectful of her feelings you are, that could make zero difference. Hopefully you'll have some success, but don't go in thinking there's some special set of words you could present *just so* that will magically change her way of thinking."
"While I see your point, I don’t agree. Her boss listened to what people said and raised her concern in a private talk with OP and offered help. Although this was uncomfortable for OP, I don’t see how her boss is at fault. Of course OP needs to make her feelings known so that it doesn’t happen again. But talking about being hurt and feeling unvalued is unreasonable."
"One of you has to lose out. Either he uproots the life he values, or you put on hold the career you value. There is no compromise. 

I'm sure you are aware now that this is something that should have been discussed prior to marriage, but that is done now. Id suggest counseling to help you work through it together. 

It may end up being a case of, what do you want more, your husband, or this particular career?"
"I'm not aware of anti depressants that act and wear off this quickly is the thing. Most of my experience with antidepressants has been like a slow burn effect. 

But yeah it's out of line if it is happening but it's an unhealthy level of paranoia if it's not so being tested 100%. "
"I think it's important to provide a counterpoint to your experience with abortion, because OP has only (I'd guess) been through this experience once. I have had an abortion and it wasn't traumatic. I knew I was doing the right thing and wasn't ready for a baby. I think this is important because his GF's reaction seems unhealthy. Your experience sounds more healthy, but OP reading your experience alone might not realize that the spectrum of reaction is very wide."
"Women are socialized to laugh it off when men aggressively hit on them, because we're often accused of being dramatic, or not being able to take a joke, or trying to stir shit, or overreacting because the guy is a 'really good guy.' Can you blame someone for not wanting to make every social situation awkward when this guy acts like this? There's a lot of negative consequences for rebuffing/embarrassing/turning down men for us."
Not to mention they were going to talk about sex!
Yeah... I think gf is justifiably insecure since it sounds like OP doesn't know her at all or care about her as a person rather than as a girlfriend accessory to his life.
"If it's affecting your sex life then out becomes an issue for your relations and not just a private behavior. Try to focus on the sex life, though. Don't try to actually monitor how much he masturbates."
What does your girlfriend think?
"She claims.

Sorry but the story doesn't ring true. Why would she not now be working with a lawyer to get her kids back. At least supervised visitation (which even addicts can get unless they've done something truly heinous)."
"I don't think it's all that weird... Frankly, splitting the cost of something like a new TV might create much more of a problem in the long run if you were to ever break up. 

But if you need the money and want to sell your old tech, then offering it for a discount if she wants it sounds pretty fair to me. Hard to just give things away when you're scrimping. "
"I don't even know you, OP, but I feel a certain sense of pride right now. Bravo."
I’ve been to rehab. You don’t end up in rehab if you only started drinking after losing custody. There’s a long road leading up to that point. 
Your ex needs to tell this new woman to chill out. The kid should always come first. Your son is very lucky that his parents are smart enough to put his needs first. The other woman definitely has issues and your ex has to set her straight. Definitely talk to ex and make a plan for your son. 
"But I feel like there's a way to let him know without giving him any identifying info. Something like, ""Hey I'm going off the grid for the weekend to an undisclosed location, don't tell anyone bc stalkers, you won't hear from me until I'm back"""
"I have a similar situation. I'm going to be vague in purpose, but the nature of the things I draw are charming to many. But there are things about the style that creep in out. Probably in the same way that dolls, mascots, and fursuits creep me out.

It's not personal. I know what I do is good. It's preference. That comes with art. I think impressionism is annoying looking, but Monet is MONEY soooo...

We've been together for 17 years, my husband and I. I'm a trained artist, he's a hobbyist. Luckily, my training includes being able to take it when someone isn't a fan. He's not telling me that my art is bad. He's telling me that he is not capable of appreciating it for what it is because he's not my target audience.

So instead of, ""Wow, baby! That looks great!""  I usually get, ""Your lines are clean, the colours are fantastic, and the arrangement of objects keeps the eye moving."" And in reference to the colours being fantastic, he actually means the quality of the work more than he means liking my palette.

It's okay not to be a fan of the style, especially because you've already decided to be supportive of a partner. ""Babe, that looks great. I'm going to admit that I don't think I'm your target audience, so I'm going to miss some of the finer points of it's greatness. But your lines are clean, the colours are fantastic, and it really keeps the eye moving!"""

I usually don’t like the idea of reversing the situation, but if she heard you talk about a 17 year old girl in the same way she would be very upset and say you were disgusting.  I don’t know how far you could take it but I would just bring up again that her comments really hurt your feelings and you wouldn’t say those things about someone you know in front of her."

"Yeah, he does know where I live.  We do live 45 minutes away, but that doesn't always mean anything to a stalker. I have been staying somewhere else, but not all the time. "
"&gt;Cops could very easily do a wellness check.....I had to do it on a friend of mine once after she disappeared. 

This is terrible advice. Sending the cops to your gf's house because her parents won't talk to you...is a hilarious /slash/ inappropriate. She's been sick two days. "
"It's not nice to ignore someone's boundaries and make them uncomfortable. It might not come from a malicious place, but it's not an acceptable behavior. The issue isn't that he's a nice person, it's that he's clingy, inappropriately attached, and pushing way too hard for something OP clearly expressed that she didn't want."
Can i get a link to that? Sounds horrible af but I'm curious 
"What was she supposed to do, after being broken up with for the 4th time in 6 months? Sit around hoping you’d change your mind? Get back together with you, knowing that it’s almost certain you’d just break up with her again?

Let’s not pretend you had a conversation with her where you expressed hesitation about getting more serious. You didn’t. You broke up with her. **FOUR TIMES.** Her moving on and sleeping with who she chooses to what’s *supposed* to happen. That’s what breaking up is. 

Maybe you were hoping she’d talk you out of it, and set herself up to be hurt and rejected by you a *fifth* time. But ain’t nobody got time for that backwards bullshit. Learn to explain how you’re feeling and how to express your needs without this all around the mulberry bush nonsense. 

Actions have consequences. You’re not a victim. You’re just experiencing a consequence. 

There’s nothing “rare” about your situation. Maybe that’s part of the problem, that you fancy yourself such a unique person that no one else can understand your actions or the motivation for them. Listen: everyone has experienced shitty things in their life. Doesn’t mean you get to barrel through life hurting people and then being shocked that they have the nerve to not want to be hurt by you any longer. Allowing past experiences to dictate your current behavior is a *choice.*"
"He just needs a reason to control you and make you the bad guy so you'll let him get away with stuff. If you need reassurance, ask any of your close friends. You're not the problem. "
"But if the rules change and we start driving on the left, then you'd look pretty stupid for driving on the right because it's tradition.

Appeal to tradition isn't very persuasive because tradition changes and cultures evolve. I suspect you're not demanding a dowry for your wife and I suspect that she will wear pants and bathing suits, drive a car, ride a bike and vote. These are all things that were highly untraditional only 100 years ago. But things change."
It doesn't seem like she even thinks that she did anything bad. According to OP it seems like the mother defended her actions with what happened to her. 
"He knows exactly what he is doing.

He didn't ask to move in, he just did it. You said nothing.

He didn't pay rent. You said nothing.

NOW you're speaking up, and ruining the great thing he had going, so of course he is going to push back. Kick him out and dump him, he's a user."
"I think it's really good that you've got this level of self awareness, OP.  One of the things I'm working on coming to terms with in my own life is that quote about how we judge ourselves by our intent, but others judge us by our actions.  I saw in your post where you say you're in therapy; that's a really good place to bring this up first.  Following onto that you may want to also look into seeing a specialist to explore medication.  I was in your shoes when I first got married.  I had successfully been off SSRIs for my depression for a couple years, but the stress of getting married and moving in together, combined with some other stressors specific to my situation really set me off the edge with anger and depression.  For me, they go hand in hand.  Going back on my meds really helped me with my anger, and definitely improved the way I was able to interact with my husband."
"Oh, I know you. You're the 'incredible sulk'. You withdraw, generally without warning or notice, you refuse to engage or address the subject while your wife tiptoes around you for some period of time, anxious and on edge, and then, during some lull or seeming period of detente, you suddenly go berserko over some absurd triviality. Which your wife is well aware has nothing to do with the actual issue, she's just forced by you into a holding pattern where all she can do is wait for the inevitable detonation. What a joy, what a great quality of life.

Also, just generally, don't tell other adults what to do, no matter how constructive (ha) you think you're being, you weren't personally appointed the grand arbiter of all things correct. I might be wrong of course, but there is a distinct whiff of the infallible man about this whole thing."
"&gt; She did not tell her to trim the bushes, she asked if she wanted to trim the bushes. I can see how for some this may seem like telling someone to, 

""Do you want to trim the bushes"" is exactly how a lot of bosses issue orders--it's not really a request or a fun suggestion, it's a mandatory task. That's how it comes off--like your mom thinks she's your fiancee's boss and can issue her orders."
"Life is far from fair, so i should be fair to myself at least. Thanks! "

I hope while saving for your rushed wedding you also start saving for the trainwreck of a divorce that is going to follow it if you go through with this marriage. 
"I mean, it's like people didn't even read OP's post. That or they are having problems discerning a platonic friendship from a crush situation."
"I'm a little surprised at all the people who are acting so shocked about this. There is a lot we don't know about your situation to make a judgement call.

First of all, if you say $3500 is your monthly disposable income, that means you make a lot of money. From this statement you sound pretty well off having $42k per year to spend on anything you want when the average salary in USA is not much more than that. If you have $42k of play money per year but we're unwilling to spend $4k one time for her parents I'd honestly say that is stingy.

However you also say that it's going toward your IRA and future home, in which case it is not really your disposable income. After those are considersations maybe your 'disposable' income is much lower. I'd be interested in seeing what the real number is.

Also no word on her parents age or condition. My folks are rural farm folks in their late 50s and mildly infirm. If I was going to ask them to fly 13 hours straight and could afford it, I'd absolutely spring for business class. I am only a bit older than you and fly a ton and find long international flights really tough being so cramped. I would never ask my parents to fly 13 hours at their age so cramped, esp if it was under $10 of my yearly play money."
"Yeah, there are cases where the girlfriend/wife legitimately wants to control their SO in this way, but 99% of the time, a female SO gets ZERO pleasure out of nagging their male SO to *do the dishes FFS.*"
"He doesn't even know you. For him to be THIS invested in such a short period, he either needs to be maladjusted with some attachment problems OR it doesn't matter to him who you really are, because he is interested in the idea of you, rather than who you are.

This gives me the heebie-jeebies and I would be totally squicked out, were I in your position."
Holy overreactions Batman!

Um. Kinda this. Sorry. "
You’re not in love. You’re infatuated and obsessed. 
"Uh, the price of elk ranges from 2.00 per pound to 18.90 per pound for the tenderloin. OP had 200 pounds of it. That sounds like a lot of money."
"1/lb per person per meal if the meat has bones

.5 to .75 meat if it has no bones. 

Those numbers are for adults. And with the appropriate number of side dishes, you can push the portion size down further"
I agree with all of this. Why did you not break up with him after these gross racist comments? You deserve and are worthy of respect. Please dump him. He is awful and does not deserve you.
"It's amazing to me that one unethical, lying, paid ""consultant"" wrote one false paper that has caused all this pain and struggle for so many people. 

I have a friend I've known all my life. We recently became friends on facebook. She constantly posts those like farming scam posts to her page (win one of 500 classic Mustang cars! Never driven! Just like and share!) I've told her repeatedly she's just putting herself in the way of like farming at the least and full on hacking or identity theft at the worst, complete with links to articles on how to spot this nonsense. And she. never. learns. She even inboxes them to me occasionally. Some people just can't seem to critically think about things and it always baffles me. I'm so suspicious I google almost everything before I post it on my own facebook page because there is just so much false narrative out there I don't want to spread more. If only more people thought that way."
"Seriously. Where I’m from it seems MORE common for dogs to be outdoor only. As long as the have shelter and food, and it’s not an area with extreme whether (e.g. no snow) it’s not abusive at all... "
"i also never said i was bipolar before i got diagnosed. now i say it all the time. take him to a doctor asap. even if he isn't manic, he made a massively irresponsible decision, left you and your kids in the lurch, essentially flushed away several thousand dollars, and lied to you about it. "
"Nargakot most likely. 

In which case he would have to probably stay the night and be up for sunrise, and IF he was lucky it would be clear. Which at this time of year is unlikely. 

I smell BS on this whole post. It just really isn’t possible. The stars would have to align for this to seriously only be a 2 days trip. And it would take a lot of planning....not just some last minute whim. You would literally have to have everything planned out to make this even possible.

And judging by OPs answers to everyone and the one post (this one) history I call bullshit on this entire story. "
"Yes, how concerning that he dared to be honest with her about how he feels! Wow."
"I mean, sure, but...

"Can I just ask why you keep referring to your situation with your girlfriend as a ""new stage"" in your life? Did you not do regular maintenance chores before this? Who did them? Did you two just move in together and you're getting used to living with a person with different standards than you? I'm asking because you're 26 years old, and generally I'd expect that a 26 year-old is somewhat familiar with picking up after themselves and taking care of general life tasks (unless you've been living at home before this and your parents were doing this background work for you). In any case, you're definitely getting too old to not be held accountable for these things, regardless of personal difficulties. "
Omg. Have some self respect. This is so sad. 
"There are a few things that make this a red flag for me:
1. He used a specific name rather than just say you are anti-social.
2. He brought up that specific name a year after she was even in the picture.
3. It's a recurring fight about a core part of your personality.

All together these things are very worrying. You should not just blow this off."
"Next post will be ""hubby blindsided me with divorce papers"". :/"
"Have your roommate tell the mother, and honestly, unless the mother has a history of accusing people of things, you should be fine. On my father's side, I am the oldest of my generation, which meant I had to supervise small snoopy little girls constantly. 

Snooping was common, them talking about their snooping stories was common, and them asking me to see my boobs (and once even pulling on my top) wasn't that uncommon. All this occurred during that rough period where kids were deemed too young for the ""talk"" (in my family at least), but old enough to know that there's something being hidden from them in regards to bodies and bedroom activities. 

I never personally feared having backlash from my family because we were the same gender and family, but similar things happened with my brother (the only cis guy in our generation of kids) and I heard from other family members it wasn't uncommon for one of my little cousins in particular to sneak into bathrooms to surprise people. 

In short, unless there is already a red flag from the mother, I wouldn't worry about it so much. I doubt this behavior just started, so the mother probably assumed such mishaps might happen. it's possible this is her first time hanging out with guys and thinks exploring and being caught is a fun activity while also a way to discover all the secrets that she knows the grown ups are hiding from her. "
"This is what makes me hate this sub sometimes--the whole ""when you are 18 you are an adult, you must be perfect and totally self-reliant and if you aren't, it is 100% valid for everyone to hate you"" mentality. 

Yesterday there was a thread about a guy who was grossed out when he overheard his wife and some other moms lusting after a 17 year old swim instructor, and everyone was like ""that's disgusting he's 17 he's a child!"" But then in a thread where someone is 18, they are treated like an adult on par with a 40 year old.

I didn't move out until I was 23 years old and I know a lot of people who didn't do so until later. Good for everyone who pulled themselves up by the bootstraps and left home at 16 because they're so independent and perfect. Most of us aren't, though. "
"Yes, it sounds like he may be severely depressed. Unfortunately I don't think OP can help him. I hope he has friends or family that can push himto get help."
I would just take this to the grave with me before I would do that.  I would never go behind his back for something like that.
"&gt;he frequently jokes about marriage being a ball-and-chain situation`

That's pretty insulting as it insinuated the female is the ball and chain. It's not a good attitude to have. He's going to keep it up unless you make him stop. It's not a joke. Either he change his attitude or you move on."
"Okay so he has anxiety...any chance he is also ADHD? Or depressed?

Is the 6 year old in school?

So what exactly does HE do? Does he prepare food for the kids? Get them dressed? Play with them?

He doesn't even let the dogs out?

Playing the ""who does more"" game is NEVER EVER productive. But it sounds like stuff just isn't getting done. And animal poop on the floor - honey, that's ridiculous. If he can't see it don't tell me he can't smell it. And with a two-year old in the house...that is just unsanitary.

He does not sound like he is very good at this stay at home dad gig. Maybe it would be better for him to go to work. But for him to say YOU don't do enough? Yeah. I would lose my shit with a conversation like that. His ass would be sleeping on the couch. You guys need to figure out how to communicate effectively and how to get housework done in a way that works for both of you. If he has ADHD or something would he benefit from lists? If he's already dealing with crippling anxiety that also sounds like depression then he needs to be getting help, not just drugs but therapy, he has to learn how to manage this so he can contribute to the household."
I would assume the roommate seeing it was his niece and is unrelated to OP in anyway nor the person who took on care ?  
Honestly her behaviour from the beginning of this story sounds very predatory. You definitely have to break it off as soon as possible.
"Are you OK with this? Sounds like no, so you can 1)accept him as he is, and watch as he slowly spirals down and drags you with him, 2)set an ultimatum that he cut off contact with his friend, remain clean, and work of his debt, or 3) tell him you know his dirty little secret and leave. "

"Yep, what a great guy he is. Absolutely the sort you should marry and have children (that you don't actually want) with."
"She, in fact, does get stellar grades without much effort. never has homework as she finishes it extremely quick after school. I know she’s doing it because there are no missing assignments in her school reports, but she’s so quick with academics that I think she’s becoming disillusioned with school and the process. She’s in the most advanced classes she’s allowed to be in. As far as clubs, she came late into school because of her father’s death and missed the window to sign up for most of them. She plans on signing up for more next year, most notably drama club, but for now she’s just literally bored to tears and I don’t know how to remedy it through the long summer ahead. "
"You’re not used to this dynamic and it isn’t what you signed up for. While it’s nice, you’re probably afraid to let your guard down to actually enjoy your husband being nice. 

Honestly - to me, your husband doesn’t sound like the greatest guy but hey, it’s your husband. Maybe he just realized that he’s grumpy and he’s attempting to make a change but unless he’s doing it for him as much as you I wouldn’t expect it to last long. Try to enjoy it if you want him to be a happier, nicer person to be around because if you stay stand-off-ish to his behavior I doubt it will last very long. "

What are the vomiting issues?  Are they still going on?  If not these children need to transition back to their own beds and she needs to come back to yours.  There has to be other issues besides the sleeping arrangements at this point.  This is seeping into the rest of your relationship right?
"I saw elsewhere in this post that y’all are supposed to move in together this summer. When talking about marriage/engagements, has it never come up that you’d like to live together for a couple of years first? "
"Yeah, what soapy said. Ignorance is the absence of opportunity to learn. At a certain point this is just being thick."
"I think she's letting you think you're making baby steps. You may have succeeded in changing her mind about vaccines, but it sounds like that was the exception not the rule.

"Is it really normal for the working parent to take time off of work for kids' drs appointments while the other parent stays at home?

"You know what's harder than learning from a range of experiences and using them to grow into your adult self? 

Trying to grow up when you're still in a relationship that started when you were 13. 

The idea that personal growth is MORE difficult when you are single is strange to me--this has not been the experience of myself or any of my other fully formed adult friends. Relationships are often far more likely to sustain unhealthy habits than being alone and having to learn from consequences of a series of personal choices over time.

Developing crushes doesn't mean she wants to cheat--crushes are natural and normal and often an inevitable part of long term relationships. That doesn't mean that her choosing to spend time with a crush ISNT shady--it is. But the crush isn't the problem. How she's handling it is. Half of her is already working on single-lady thoughts. She should commit to being single.

The fact that she is frequently thinking about exploring life as a single woman is absolutely normal for a person in their early 20s who has literally only been with one person ever. It is far less common for HS sweethearts to make it long term than it is for them to outgrow the relationship and lose interest in the long term commitment.

When you get to a point in a relationship where you are constantly plagued by outside temptation, the mature, adult thing to do is end the relationship BEFORE you cross a moral line that you can't come back from.

"When I worked at a hospital affiliated with a university, we used to get students in frequently.  We noticed that we had a run of them being visited by a ""pastor.""  After talking with the families, we found out that all of those being ""ministered"" to had tanked since they joined that ""church.""  Grades dropping, no contact with family and friends, strange behavior.  

We soon realized that this guy was a cult leader preying on lonely college students.  We tried to figure a way to stop him from visiting but since he was a so-called pastor we couldn't stop him.  We finally reported his activity to somebody at the school and eventually we quit seeing him, so maybe they moved him on.

But your girl is displaying all the signs of a new recruit to a cult.  If you can get her to move in with you for a while, you might be able to save her.  If not, there's probably not much you can do.  I'm sorry you're caught up in this."

"With his financial situation, I can see why a prenup might be called for. I find the idea kind of crushing honestly, like he's seeing he doesn't trust you, but I know everyone doesn't see it that way. You should get your own lawyer and make sure the prenup protects you too.

Also you shouldn't pay 50-50 for expenses once you are married, why even get married if you aren't going to build a life TOGETHER? "

But at the same time, there are some times where I'm a little sad because I'm never again going to have those new-relationship flurries, or feel the rush of a hook-up, or be with a woman again, or even go through the drama of a heartbreaking end of relationship.

And then I think about how much stress and annoyance dating was, and then I'm okay."
"&gt;She now says she won't talk until I apologize and let her dogsit. 

Okay. Problem solved. 

This is the hill she wants to die on? Let her at it. If she wants to control you more than she wants a relationship with you then say okay and let her deal with the consequences.  This is not on you. She does not get to decide your life, your property, your job, your dog training. 

For her this is not about the dog. This is about forcing you to accommodate her wants. I know you want a relationship with her, and you want to spend time with her. She is the one putting a restriction on that and from the sound of it she should have tried for a relationship a long time ago instead of bullying a grown adult. 


Let her throw her dramatic fits. Mail her a present. Tell your family ""This isnt up for discussion. If you keep trying to pressureme I will be forced to go no contact with you also. I am an adult and this is my decision alone.""

"When the last person you called girlfriend didn't meet your expectations and hurt you, you become reluctant to give that title/power to someone else because you are putting that person in a position to hurt you as well.

Typical behavior for someone who isn't over their ex yet, which is why people need to learn to give themselves enough time to heal and move on before starting something with someone new. 

At the same time though you should recognize when someone isn't over an ex and leave them alone. "
"I don't think he's being controlling. He said he had no problem with you going out, staying out late, he just wants a text from you that you're safe and home for the night (even if it's 3am). 

Why can't you do this? He already knows you'll be out late and just wants to know you're in, so ""I don't want to text because I don't want to disturb him"" doesn't really fly here because he specifically asked for the heads up. "

"Ok. Let's imagine for a moment that being attracted to other people and wanting to cheat on your partner are two different things (spoiler, they are.) In the event that he is a healthy normal 22 year old person who notices that other people are occasionally attractive and then gets accused of wanting to cheat - multiple times - then yeah, I can imagine him getting impatient when you bring it up. And yeah, I can imagine him getting angry when you accuse him of wanting to cheat based on that. None of that is irrational or unusual. "
"It's also good to keep in mind these people don't care about what's best for the dog. You've explained why it's best for him to be at daycare already, and their reasons for wanting your mom to take him are because she can, and she wants to. Not because of what the dog needs or wants, just what your mom wants. I know you're not considering leaving the dog with her, but this is further confirmation that you've made the right call. 

Sorry your family feels entitled to bossing you around.... if it were a friendly offer, and not them trying to be controlling, the bullshit would have stopped when you said 'no thanks'. That they're trying to bully you into doing something with your dog that makes you uncomfortable, even after you've told them that, shows their true motives. "

"Just gotta say, commitment problems don't equate to exclusivity problems. Most of the time (in my experience) you can tell the difference between a sleaze who just wants the excuse to fuck other people because ""we weren't in a real relationship!"" and a guy who doesn't want to put in the effort of a real relationship for whatever reason but also doesn't want to sleep with other people.

Your BF dismisses your concerns and sides with your mother, especially on issues that will cost you money.  RED FLAG 4.

Geez idk why you're finding it so hard to say no to this guy. Why would he ask you to waste your time, money, effort, etc doing some stupid ""gesture"" if he wasn't trying to get you to move there. 

Wake up, OP. You're young and don't need to be compromising for some ~~ass~~ guy."
"What types of things, exactly? I'm just curious... things about you, or your mother?"
"Does he have a solid plan in place? 

Honestly one of the biggest red flag I see that he's your boyfriend and you openly admit he's lazy. In my experience, it usually gets pretty bad for someone's s/o to openly admit something like that. You already have a gut feeling that he's lazy, and we both know that telling people you're going to do something and actually doing something are two completely different things. "
"This is ridiculous. Enjoy your acceptance and chill. If he can't deal with his family, that's on him."
"He is entirely in the right in this situation. Deleting your saves without asking if you wanted to back them up was a bit of a genitalia-neuter move, but if they were on his hard drive they were his to delete. The games are his as per your agreement, don't be the guy that reneges."
That makes it even worse. He's telling you he won't respect your boundaries because he's bad at respecting boundaries. Dressing it up to sound like it has anything to do with being into you makes it worse.
"Or if she has the child, she might not be able to get a passport in time for the infant. I know someone that skipped a family wedding for fear they wouldn't be able to get the birth certificate and passport paperwork finished in the ~2 weeks between birth and the wedding. I can't imagine traveling that soon after giving birth would be much fun either."
My immediate thoughts!  You need to run!!!!!!  His actions are NOT normal. This is a red flag for gas lighting behavior that seems like he cares but he is really just controlling and insecure.  Emotionally balanced people don't act this way. Be careful how you break it off.  He will likely turn on you.  
Probably most grandmothers and mothers full stop! My mum tells me she misses me and wishes I was there often and since getting close with my boyfriend has begun saying things like that to him too and he thinks it’s adorable and it makes us both feel loved by her. I think it’s a little sad that an innocent comment has turned into this.
"'Wish you were here' is just something you say. It's a wish. It means 'I wish we were together' (unless one of you is like, in an exotic locale on vacation or something and it's on a postcard). It isn't that deep."
"She’s not the one here asking for advice. Of course her behavior is inexcusable, but OP should also reevaluate the conditions of his untenable relationship."
Even if she did live there you don't do that on the fucking sofa. You have a private room for a reason. You don't shag all over the communal items. Especially not if you dont own them. It's just disrespectful.

"It sounds like chippendales is more akin to a burlesque performance than a strip club, so she could have been thinking burlesque and Hooters esque places were acceptable but pure and cut strip clubs are off limits. This really should have been discussed more in depth before she went to Vegas and before you decided to lie and cross the line she drew in the sand. Yes, it's somewhat hypoctitcial of her and she should have been more clear about her thoughts on what's okay and not okay, but you both are at fault for poor communication. "
"Your things are still there and you can come and go as you please.  To her, it probably doesn't feel like 100&amp;#37; her own place because she still has to consider you to an extent.  Until you officially move out, it's still a little bit your place, and it's reasonable for her to ask you to pay rent.  The only compromising you can try to do is how much rent.  I get that this sucks, but you're an adult and she doesn't have to house you and your things for free."
"I’m gonna take an unpopular stance. 

I sort of feel for your wife. I feel like we’re obviously only seeing your side of things, natural when you’re telling the story. But I can see how she could be a little jealous. 

Would you be ok if she was texting, buying lunch, getting drinks, and laughing all day with a hottie with a naughty body at her work? Then if he was extremely excited to see her at a party, would it not bother you at all? 

She’s definitely insecure, but I feel like people here are so quick to crucify the other person in the relationship that has these insecurities. Maybe you could just talk to your wife about everything and idk...compromise? Isn’t that what it’s all about? "
"ABSOLUTELY there’s more to discuss! Preferably with a counselor. He may have said he’s sorry, but unless he’s identified what pushed him toward that behavior and figured out how he’s going to handle things differently next time, you’ll just be waiting for the other show to drop. "
"Question is, if Alice will drop this kind of ultimatum over something so innocent, is she worth all of this in the first place? What happens when they're married, OP has found himself a new job and this time she wants him to quit over another coworker for XYZ reasons? 

If OP isn't leaving something out, she doesn't seem like the most stable person IMO. A good partner would be dealing with their insecurities, not dropping ultimatums to serve those insecurities. "
To a degree. But he is doing something to Kate’s children that she wouldn’t have wanted done. There’s a reason why we usually honor dead parents’ requests regarding their children’s care. This woman just doesn’t care about Op’s kids and Kate knew that. She has no business being their stepmom.

And she also needs to take that poor cat with her. 
You going to the gym is a good thing. It’s not something she should be upset at you at. You can’t sit at home 24/7 because she has to. She needs therapy and you might need to walk away from the relationship. 
"You already know the answer, you just don't want to admit it to yourself. 

You want us to confirm what you secretly already know. "
I think you're gf is overreacting and honestly being a child about it. You explained your reasoning which honestly is reasonable and in the end she blocks you and breaks up with you over it. Idk she sounds immature af
"What should OP do then? Personally, I would definitely avoid people who treated my family and me the way OP's inlaws have treated her and her son. Doesn't matter what their relationship to me is, a stranger or my own parents. 

And I would not tolerate my family of origin treating my husband with anything but respect.  It would be at their peril to do so. 
"
Nope.  Op says in anothwr comment that it because of her mum committing fraud after her business failed
"At this point she isn't even in a relationship with you. She is with some twisted version of yourself that isn't even real. Mental illness is really tough stuff but it isn't an excuse to be a horrible partner. She'd rather keep you down in life than see you succeed. Really think about that. Can you see yourself long term with someone who resents you for every achievement, accolade, and generally anything positive in your life? You cant keep this up. Is she in therapy? If not you need to give an ultimatum because she desperately needs help. "
What??? I’m not being sexually harassed! And why would I want to accuse my coworkers of creating a toxic work environment when my question was about how to *improve* my relationship with my coworkers?! 
"Okay, then edit that into the post so commentors stop trying to make suggestions along these lines.  I was going to suggest those side by side craftmatic beds, but that doesn't sound like it'll work.  

Sorry about your relationship.  :\-\(  "

"&gt; If the answer is “no” that increases the plausibility of it being tampered with at the store.

Side note, but if the answer is ""no"" make sure your bf never buys that brand again. It's not that hard or expensive for a company to use tamper-evident or tamper-proof packaging, and condoms are certainly a serious enough product to warrant it. Even a sealed cardboard box is tamper-evident."
Exactly!! I don't have a reason to mistrust him but I can't wrap my head around the motivation here :(

"###***Do. Not. Pressure. Her.***

I'm sure you have good intentions, but you're barking up the wrong tree entirely. It's clear that your GF is seriously uncomfortable with getting more intimate, and to be honest, your increased advances are likely making her even more so. Especially if she's had previous incidents with being forced into sex.

Communication is really important. Have a chat with your girlfriend about how she feels around the subject, but for the love of god, if she even seems *slightly uncomfortable* with the idea of doing something, *don't push her*. "
"Not a high horse.  Just a matter of fact.  You make comments like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/8dnlp4/addicted_to_being_high/dxoxaly/) online.  You are not in a place in life to dole out child raising advise, especially when that advise is abandonment.  Get help."
"Sounds like he fell prey to new relationship energy.  When you’re with someone for years, you see their flaws, their weakest moments, etc.  then you get a new relationship and it’s fun and exciting (he was 2 weeks in) but you don’t see that this new person snores, or is terrible with money or believes crazy conspiracy theories.  
I’m really proud of you for dumping your BF.  Because two weeks isn’t enough to establish a long term connection or even really know anything about someone else. He doesn’t even know if this other woman is interested in him or single and looking or that he has a chance with her.  But he was willing to hurt you over it.  "
"I don't know, I feel like trust is kind of important...

Me and my two housemates (all female) spontaneously booked a European city break recently, and I told my SO afterwards excitedly, and he was excited for me. Not saying every situation is the same but maybe you're reading too much into it. Sounds like a fun holiday with a friend.

OP, you've been with your SO for 1.5 years, do you have any reason not to trust them? In addition, the post makes it seem like you didn't ask her about the friend yet, I'm unclear on that part. If not, then do it! Then all will become clear, it could just be a girls holiday!"
"In all your examples, I kind of see her side. I mean, if she's tried a restaurant and it wasn't very good, then it makes sense to go somewhere else. Same with museums. It doesn't matter if she was there with an ex, a friend, family member, or by herself, she's simply stating that it wasn't a great experience and suggesting something else.

Overall she seems like she is up for a lot of different things, and has ideas about things she wants to do, which is half the battle when finding stuff to do as a couple. It sounds like you have some sort of jealousy about her ex and the fact that she had certain experiences with him. You need to get over it, I mean you knew when you got together that she dated other people.

On the camping thing, to a lot of people (myself included), it's not a very pleasant experience. Sleeping on the ground, being subject to extreme weather, bugs, feeling dirty, and eating only food that can be prepared over a campfire is just not everyone's idea of a good time. State camp showers and toilets are also often pretty disgusting. If she's tried it before and didn't enjoy it, then why would you push her to do something that will just make it miserable for her?

Have you looked into renting a summer home/cottage for a weekend? Or staying at an airbnb or B&amp;B somewhere near or within a state park? Maybe that way you can get your outdoor time during the day but also have comfortable sleeping and shower arrangements in the evening."
"It’s possible that they moved their flirtations on to other people in the group?

There’s absolutely nothing wrong with (respectfully) hitting on people.  She shot them down clearly, you don’t know if these guys took it with good grace and moved on to her friends or if they continued to aggressively pursue.  If it’s the former, I don’t see why it’s inherently wrong to play volleyball with them, especially if her friends are responding positively to the group that approached them.  It’s also not clear that her boyfriend would have been unwelcome or disrespected, from OPs descriptions it sounds like boundaries were clearly stated and respected."
"Don't pursue her further if this is how you feel. Everybody deserves to have someone who absolutely adored them inside and out and it's not fair for you to let her believe you can give this to her. You should never enter a relationship hoping they will get more attractive, that's a recipe for disaster. "
Your mother is abusing you. You need to report her to the authorities - even talking to s school counselor would be a good way to start
"You never mentioned why you feel the need to open your marriage?

I remembered reading a post on here a couple of weeks ago about a couple who thought nearly the exact same thing you did. Except when they did open it up, their emotions got the better of them and it got negative really fast, jealousy, insecurity, anxiety. And both thought they would be okay with it before. The point I’m trying to say is, you never know how this would REALlY effect you both until you try it. As in, it could go really negative really fast, even though none of you think it would now, and by then it’s already too late.

Also, I think if you were to do it, you should get rid of the last rule-not telling each other anything. Communication is important, if you both can’t handle hearing that your partner is sleeping with someone else and be okay with that, then you aren’t fully prepared to open up the relationship yet. "
"Make it two days before the 30th birthday, in case he's serious - she can beat him to it. She should make sure to include infidelity in the reasons for the divorce since he's admitted on multiple occasions in front of witnesses to having an affair."
"Having sex with you is in no way proof of heterosexuality. 1) Bisexuality. 2) Gay men have had sex with women before. They've had lifelong marriages with women pretending to be straight. Sexuality is complicated. 

This isn't to implicate Will's sexuality. If he IDs as straight...ok. People can identify as whatever they want to. But he almost certainly wants to fuck Caleb, like come on dude get your shit together."
"I am aware that my emotions are not very rational, hence why I have come here to get things off my chest and find a way to proceed in a healthy manner. In hindsight I see the grave mistakes I have made and how I probably should have been more willing to work on things instead of pushing for a divorce. I was doing good with the situation until recently thats why I have come to seek advice "
"Go live with your dad during the week? You’re not your mom’s comfort animal and you’re not responsible for caring for her. The fact that you even feel responsible for her happiness is a codependent flag. Your mom should be able to fill her own life with activities, and if she can’t, definitely don’t let her leech onto your life!

Tell your dad what’s been going on with your moms questions if you need leverage to get him back into court so you can testify about your living preferences to the family court judge."
"This isn't a problem with the girl staying with you. This is a problem with your SO.

Question about your living situation: you pay rent? If so.. you need to talk to your SO about making unilateral decisions about your living situation. It's not fair of her to act like this. If she disagrees, you should take your rent elsewhere.

If you don't pay rent... well, this is a consequence of being dependent on other people. You don't have any leverage."
"3 years. A lot of factors go into it, last year I made 25k less. But I live in a tech city. Almost all our jobs are tech and they yes they pay well. Startups maybe not quite as much, I work for a corporation. 

If someone in NYC isn’t making 6 figures as a developer they need to find a new job."
"He is gonna end up killing you or the baby or the cats. LEAVE NOW. And take the poor cats with you, you can surrender them at a no-kill shelter so that they can find loving homes."

"What does this mean? 'beard'?

Edit: oh I think I actually got it myself, he's using her to hide his true self? "
This is a really great comment!
"That is not true. Lying to your child and tricking them into taking 5-10 laxatives a day for no medical issue will absolutely get her a visit from CPS. 

I didn't say she'd be taken away from her mom. But this family needs help."
"A couple of questions:  
1) Are you legally required to pay off your parents' debt?   
2) Do you *want to* marry your boyfriend?  

If the answer to question 1 is no, and the answer to question 2 is yes, then say yes when he asks.   
  
On the other hand, if you think so little of him that you fear he would disrespect your whole family over the debt, maybe is not that great a guy to begin with."
They couldn't prove she was drunk driving but they would at least get her for leaving the scene of an accident if they could prove it was her.
"You've never been pregnant or terminated an unwanted pregnancy, she's not going to expect you to empathize or know the perfect thing to say. Just let her know you don't judge her for her decision and thank her for placing trust in you to share something so personal."
"If your friend is so adamant about you going to therapy it's probably because she's sick of taking the brunt of your mood. Being friends with a depressed person can be incredibly draining, because it's like trying to push a sad rock up a hill, but the rock is essentially pushing back with negative self-talk. This doesn't make you a bad person or anything, but it does mean you are probably in pretty bad shape mental health-wise. Go see a therapist."
"Tell her that when she reports herself to the police for the hit and run while admitting to being under the influence (and she provides proof of this).  You will consider selling the car to her.  I have a feeling she won't be interested in your car anymore.

In all honesty, in good conscious, you may want to anonymously report her to the police.  If you know the rough time and location of the accident, it probably won't be too difficult for the police to identify her."
"Seems like you're making up this love addict thing to make yourself feel better about her behavior. The truth is, she sounds like a pretty typical early 20s person, if a little over dramatic perhaps. I agree with the person who suggested dating someone older. Also, you can't try to reason or talk her out of thinking about her ex and back into love with you. Even if she does have a problem with love addiction, how do you know you're the real love, and it's not this ex who is the 'real' love? Even if she is a love addict, surely she should treat that while not being in a rleationship. Ultimately, it looks like you should let her go and start the process of moving on. "
"&gt; Thanks. I wanted to make sure I could stomach his burgeoning bald spot and his portly belly before I did the horizontal mambo with him 


From the sounds of it you weren't really out of his league though. So, before you start bashing this guys' looks, look at your own. Your attitude alone on here makes you unattractive. "

That's pretty selfish if it means leaving him living in misery.
"Really, you've gotta think about what sort of long-term compatibility you're going to have. If you're a full-on true-believing Mormon, then you're going to want to tithe 10% to the church, as well as a whole host of other things (no coffee/tea, no soft drinks depending on how you interpret the WoW, no alcohol, wearing temple garments instead of regular underpants, etc. etc. etc). And beyond that, you'll presumably want to have kids - and then the question is how they're raised.

It might work with this girl, perhaps - but it's an uphill battle. You definitely need to take a step back. But, take a few minutes to look at the behavior that the church culture encourages. All these young people, told not to have sex, and told that even *masturbating* is something that you need to confess to your bishop. So you've got these kids who are pressure cookers of hormones, with zero outlet - except to get married. So, you end up with people marrying after dating for &lt;6 months, which you seem to recognize is a pretty bad idea. So, given that all the prohibitions on sex seem to cause some significantly problematic issues - consider that it might be a good idea for people to have the freedom to have a responsible non-harmful sexual outlet that doesn't involve a life-long commitment with someone that you may or may not be compatible with.

Also, before you commit and get married to anyone (especially a TBM), consider researching the history and truth claims of the church a little more thoroughly. I've read tens or hundreds of stories in the exmo forum from people who rushed from high school to mission to marriage, and only *after* all that did they happen to learn about the problematic issues. And that leads to some *huge* problems in marriages when one person starts re-thinking the church, while the other person isn't interested in that at all."

"Your reaction is really strange, I think. When reading your post, I'm not at all under the impression she's speaking all the time about her ex, but only that she asserts her preferences based on what she already lived. You blowing this way out of proportion, like for the restaurant things you can just say 'oh, I've read a review about it/friends told me it was good, it might have changed, we can maybe try it?!' like her ex doesn't have anything to do with it.

I thought while reading your title that you were trying to find a way for her to enjoy camping/outdoorsy stuffs more, and even if it hasn't anything to do with the core of the issues, you can try some things:
- If you have smaller hikes near your home, you can begin by bringing her there like just for the day. If she's not outdoorsy, she might have difficulties to follow you for a two days hike and she might need a bit of a training so it also helps with that.
- Sometimes camping (at least in France) propose alternative housing, like cabins and stuff that are more rustic than a classic motel but nicer for her
- If you wanna go for a long time, maybe a camping car could also helps. "

"You just keep looking though.

I got one at 26 easily. 32 is not going to be a big problem for most doctors. If it's a problem just find a different doctor. 
"
"&gt; if you love each other who cares right?

No. That's not how relationships work. 

This guy doesn't seem to respect you. He's getting what he wants out of sex and doesn't care what you want."
You’re infatuated. Your wife deserves someone much better who doesn’t mistake affair fog and newness for anything real. 
"Except this isn't some kind of small company with like 10 employees where everyone's like family.

&gt; Its for some woman he works with, who he never sees outside of work and he works n a completely different department to her these days so he barely ever spends time with her at work either. He hasn't met the groom at all.

Sounds like the BF actually isn't that close with the bride at all (nevermind the groom, who he's never even met!). More likely the bride just has a large number of work friends, and decided to simply invite everyone at work so as not to inadvertently leave anyone out/make anyone feel hurt. I doubt the bride actually expects (or even wants) everyone at work to show up.

This is underscored by:

&gt; No RSVP date listed on it and he apparently was only sent it 4 weeks ago.

The bride has to expect that a large number of people won't be able to make a weekend wedding with only 4 weeks' notice. I'm certain the ""core"" group she wants to attend has known about the wedding for *far* longer than 4 weeks."
"That's a bit harsh. I think everyone focuses on the bad in others when they're pissed off at them, that's pretty natural!"
Sounds like the wife is taking the whole brunt of childcare and the husband is trying to live like nothing has changed.
"yes, but op specifies that they rent"
