"It's about what you value. If someone thinks tax policy is more important than people losing their civil rights I have no time for their hurt feelings. I actually hear people make the argument that calling them racist is so hurtful it forces them to become racist! Guess what, they were already there and deserve to be shamed."

"""Right to bare arms"" would be changed to fit the particular model of gun at the time. Yeah you can have a gun, as long as you can still call it a musket. The founding fathers didn't have AR-15s for 15 year olds in mind when writing that one. "

"But why do that? Why spend resources and create a new beurocracy? How about just be a ton more efficient and spend that money on actual security?

And the ""crazy"" part is that people don't want their teachers armed. The idea is extremely disconcerning, and the kore guns around, the more gun accidents. This idea is likely to lead to an increase in dead children. That's bad."

If you think Pringles causes heart attacks you need to learn more about nutrition. The fat has a minor role of increasing CVD risk but not a tremendous impact compared to other nutrients not found in Pringles. It would be more accurate to suggest it increases cancer risk. It's sad but I imagine many could lower their CVD risk by eating exclusively Pringles within a healthy caloric limit - our diets are that bad.

"I think the counter argument is - regulation will help make what is already happening *more* safe and consensual.

Edit: I'm just providing the counter argument that is all over the thread that this person just ignored.  I honestly don't have a strong opinion either way, but as a guiding principal i do believe making things illegal sometimes makes them more dangerous, exploitative and lucrative. "

It's a doctor free, judgement free safe space for survivors and advocates for survivors. "

"&gt; All /u/imhuman100percent said was 'Everyone has a mom'. This isn't fetishizing motherhood: it's stating fact.

yeah, except she's using it to imply that everyone has some deep relationship with their mother. It's the equivalent of a dog whistle, not a statement of a fact. 

That said, thanks for the sincere comment, but there's nothing to work on between my mother and I. She's not evil by any stretch, but she's never actually apologized to any for anything, as far as I'm aware. She's said ""I'm sorry, but...""  followed by her justifying herself. 

As far as I can tell, she's got some borderline personality disorder and maybe a bit of narcissism mixed together. She hasn't earned any honesty from me regarding what I think of her. I'm just being placating and keeping her computer running so that when she eventually dies, she won't give what would otherwise be my share of the inheritance to the catholic church. 

I'm sure the next time I find a passable therapist, mothers will come up. But I have no illusions that there's anything to be gained from actually talking to her. "

"I know that, it just seems strange to me that someone would be that upset if their ex died, the ex-wife was literally screaming like a psycho. I would have expected her to express her sorrow, and maybe shed a few tears, but not act like the world was  ending. 

Generally if you divorce someone, it means that you don't care for them anymore. You might not necessarily hate them, you might even still be friends, but you no longer feel strongly about this person. To me, it seems that his ex-wife definitely still loved him to some extent, and that perhaps he was the one who initiated the divorce, while she didn't want to separate."

"Welcome to human history. That's not unique to Canada. When civilizations clash, especially when one is expanding into the territory of another, shit happens. It's been that way for thousands of years. Read the book ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" by Jared Diamond. It addresses the causes and results of such clashes throughout history very well in regions all over the globe.

Canada's not alone in mistreatment of indigineous people. Amends have more than been made. They've been made to the point of enabling a society of dependents. If anything, that's an even bigger injustice. It's completely corrupted their culture. Source: Have native family members.

Time to move on and be one united country of Canadians. Not separate ""nations within a nation"". That fool Trudeau and his ilk are doing everything they can to prevent that from happening. "

"Funny story, the first time I visited London i met this guy at a pub and got talking to him. I made a joke about him knowing the queen and he said he did. I thought he was joking so played along and he was like no seriously I do. Turns out I was talking to prints Harry and he actually took me and my little brother on a guided tour of birmingham palace. He gave me his personal email as he said it was refreshing to talk to someone 'real' as he put it. We emailed for a bit but then we both got to busy and ended up loosing contact "

- Telling someone who was bullying me in middle school ""This is why Columbine happened"" even though I had no intent of doing any such thing (and still don't).

- Looking up ""how to build a nuclear bomb"" on my elementary school's computers (when I was in elementary school)

- Watching all of Scott Manley's videos on Nuclear Weapons

- Just generally being a deviant

- Hating everything other than my friends.

"I do consider that ancient, yes. The oldest place I've lived in was 15 years old when I moved in, and I've never actually met anyone that's lived in a house much older than that, other than my grandparents who lived in a house from the 70s all the way up to 2005, so even then it was only 35 years before it was time to move. It's similar to cars. I rarely see a car over 7 years old. Most cars I see start to rust at about 5 years, so it costs way more to fix them than to just buy/lease a new car. All of this is in North America though, so I imagine the housing in Europe is much older and it's probably more common to live in 100 year old homes over there."
