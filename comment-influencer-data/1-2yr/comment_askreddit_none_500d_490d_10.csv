"Why the fuck did you even bother commenting? Are you ready? Are you ready to lose quite possible ALL of the karma you've earned? Fucking vegans man. You don't see anyone that eats meat flaunting it like a fucking Purple Heart. We sit here and mind our own business, and yet *we're* the problematic ones. Not the people that wanna get in everyone's face and act like they're part of some super elite secret society, but the ones that eat meat."

"Yeah, women's underwear are more for show than anything else. People that think discomfort would occur do not really get women's anatomy I think and how that functions with clothes."

Its funny that polish people are the most racist when they are the lowest of the europeans.
"She probably is fat. But I was responding to /u/Soggy_Biscuit_'s ""why would she randomly insult someone?"" specifically addressing the fact that even if the sister is fat, still why would the cashier randomly insult her.


I think that's because the cashier is racist, and probably doesn't call people who look more like herself cows, while calling fat white girls cows.


But the reddit circlejerking hivemind seems to believe that it's because the casher was having a bad day, or because the girl did something to deserve it or for any other reason than the possibility of a non-white cashier having irrational hatred towards white people.

"i don’t need help, what i needed was to not be inconvenienced by this person and their poor choices 

i’m not haunted by it, just annoyed at all the people i had to talk to until i finally said “i talked to your friend over there already, i got things to do”

my goal in life is to be content and to minimize hassles 

this was an enormous hassle "

"Digital signals are addressed between the sending and receiving devices, and are frequently spread spectrum.

"Really? Because the fucking [National Coffee Association] (http://www.ncausa.org/About-Coffee/How-to-Brew-Coffee) disagrees with you

&gt; Your brewer should maintain a water temperature between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal extraction. Colder water will result in flat, under-extracted coffee, while water that is too hot will also cause a loss of quality in the taste of the coffee. (However, cold brew does not need any heat.)"

"That men enjoy oral and anal sex. It's a lie marketed by the porn industry (CBN) simply because of a fad that started and ended in the 1970s that caused a many porn producer (Ron Jeremy) to make to many videos featuring anal and oral sex. It's sounds silly but it worked, pubescent boy watch oral and anal porn and they see the actors pretending to enjoy it, so they fantasize about how great it will feel when they finally ""hook up"". Their ignorance has driven the porn industry (CBN) to create and market more and more pornographic films which just spread these fake facts. 

Personally I've tried a dozen time to give my husband oral sex and it does nothing for him. He only enjoys handjobs and vaginal sex. He does also enjoy the occasional pegging, like most men. "

raw meat exhibits that danger zone all the time. If you leave a chicken breast on the counter for four hours it's not safe to eat but it probably looks and smells the same."
"Probably not, just thinking about what petite and small means. Some people unfairly say it’s because you’re in the closet and actually want men. Others say you must be pedofilic for liking “small girls”

"He would need to be consistently away (probably over a 50% absent rate), you'd have to assume that all the students acknowledged that it was because he was away that the fun events happened and every time he was away the fun stuff would have to happen, consistently, all day. There could be absolutely no other reason that students could think of than the association between him being absent and them having fun, you'd also be assuming that all students actually found the activity fun."

"&gt; Firstly, The G stands for ""Global""

You just contradicted yourself. It's not global if Australia wasn't effected. Which other countries weren't affected, pal? Many more.

&gt;  quality of life is what matters, cost of living matters if wages don't also scale

Clever boy, throwing out an extremely subjective measure as if it proves your point.

Australia also has the population of what, Florida? Shit comparison. How many third world immigrants come to Australia?

&gt; Hence worse quality of life.

Stop treating this as if it is a scientific measure. It's not. I'd rather live at 1950s standards than live in an authoritarian regime where the average lifespan is 100."

"Well in Latin America there are many white latinos also.  White people on average have better privilege or families with money. Not always just like United States people can be considered white trash. But it is some what true. And people with darker skin or more tan are considered lesser at times. I live in Colombia, people do not want there skin to get tan. You will see on sunny days people use umbrellas to keep out of the sun. My wife hate when she gets tan, because she gets tan fast and dark fast. she thinks having tan dark skin is ugly. Also if you look at Spanish TV especially novellas. Usually the actors have lighter skins, and if there are darker skinned actors they are usually worker. like farmers who work in the field or maids or butlers."

"About twenty years ago, I regularly bought organic applesauce.   At some point, I bought conventional applesauce from a grocery store.  I could not believe the difference. Unbelievable.
