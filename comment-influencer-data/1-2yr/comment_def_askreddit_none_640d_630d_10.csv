"Having friends. 

I'm super close to my family, I talk to my brother at least once a day, and I tell my dog all of my personal secrets. I moved to a new state nine months ago and have made zero friends, have learned absolutely no one's name (with the exception of doctors, but those def aren't friends), and give absolutely zero fucks."
"Running the light

Spending 20 seconds taking the microphone out of the stand, and then not moving the stand out of the way when they are done attempting to get it out of there

Every Joke they tell involves a penis, a stereotype, or a dead celebrity. They get bonus points for using all three in the same joke.

Their bits are way too long and don't have a punchline. Usually because they saw a professional do it, liked their style, and tried to emulate it with little to no experience.

They write their bits with the assumption of a response from the audience. They don't get the response they were looking for, but they react as if they did anyway.

puns, puns, and more puns. They are basically just reading clever tweets to the audience
