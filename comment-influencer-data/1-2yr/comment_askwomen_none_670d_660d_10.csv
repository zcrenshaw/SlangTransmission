"The importance of physical attraction. Attrac*tion* is different than attrac*tiveness.* Being physically attracted to someone doesn't necessarily mean that they are a perfect 10. I've dated overweight men, men with adult acne, men with offkilter features, etc., all of whom I was physically attracted to personally even if they weren't Hollywood tier. But this is often twisted and made out to be ""if you care at all about physical features in a partner then you are shallow."" "

"I think Lena Dunham only thinks inside her little orbit, and everything else to her is completely fungible.

Aurora Perrineau is outside of her orbit, accusing someone in her orbit of something, therefore she's a liar."
"It is what it is . I appreciate that an apology was issued and that he acknowledged the truthfulness of the allegations against him. I appreciate that he pointed out the unwillingness of people to believe the women due to Louis ' status. I appreciate all these things because they help end the narrative that all accusers are liars. However it doesn't change the fact that these were horrible acts committed without punishment either legal or within the entertainment community. We can accept this apology, but we don't have to accept the person back into the public's  good grace yet. I appreciate the apology, Louis, and the insight it provided.  Unfortunately it does not change my view of the person who issued it. There is a lot of work to be done to repair the damages that will go far beyond nice words."
"Caring about a partner's finances. OK, maybe going after very rich people you aren't attracted to is shallow, but it's not wrong to reject someone who can't support themselves. "
Carry an object I was already carrying.
Jason Momoa. Because look at him. He also seems to be delightful. 
Body Glide anti-chafing stick to use on your feet before wearing shoes without socks. Especially great for heels or strappy sandals. Using that first and I never get blisters or red marks or any other common shoe pain related issues. 
"My brother gave me a tshirt a few years ago because it shrunk. Its has a reference to one of my favorite shows, Archer. It has ISIS written on it...-__-

Nobody needs to be walking around with a shirt like that on, let alone a brown girl like me.

"Drive a truck/SUV towing a trailer. 

We had to rent a uhaul trailer when my husband changed jobs. I went to pick it up. 

First the guy didn't believe me that my vehicle could tow a medium sized trailer (it had previously towed a large flatbed with a 81 el Camino on it)

Then he asked me for the license of the person that would be driving. I handed him mine. ""No sweetheart, I need the driver of the vehicle's license. Who is going to be driving for you? Husband, boyfriend, father?"" 

He suggests I get the expensive insurance so I won't be liable, insinuating I will crash/damage the trailer. I politely decline. 

Now it's time to hook up the trailer. He says ""Just back in as close as you can get it, I can move the trailer to you."" I finally snapped and said ""Just point to the god damn ball. I know what I'm fucking doing."" Got it centered perfectly, then had to show him how my hitch worked.

He never asked if I had towed before. If he had, I would have explained I have been moving trailers since before I got my license. 

Runner up: When I worked at Walmart and was the only licensed forklift driver in the store. Customer needed a pallet of bricks loaded on to his trailer. I said give me a few minutes, and went to find a spotter. He thought I went to get a man to drive the forklift, and freaked out saying ""Shes a girl! She can't drive a forklift! She'll wreck my trailer!"" "
"Working to live instead of living to work.

I was always an over-achiever as a kid. I got top grades, got into a top school, everyone thought I was going into some kind of fancy six figure career. 

I graduated university and all of that stopped, because I was *miserable.* Despite my achievements it never felt like enough and I felt like a failure. Now my career-driven friends, parents and to an extent my husband think I'm wasting my potential in a ""coaster"" job. Maybe they're right. But I refuse to be ashamed of the fact that I found a low stress job I never take home with me, that keeps me comfortable financially and allows me tons of time to pursue my hobbies, travel or relax. I refuse to be ashamed of the happy, comfortable, meaningful life I've built for myself instead of some vague sense of world-changing ""potential."""

"Moisturizer, it's not just for women guys, that dry skin needs help."
"Lift a 25 pound box. Because he thought my ""female organs"" would detach and then I couldn't children and don't I want a bunch of children in the next few years?!"
"Well I️ just left him, because he was more wrong then right, but I️ can tell you how right he was for me. 

He was smart and strong and funny. We could stay up all night talking for hours. About anything and everything. He had this spark that I️ doubt I’ll ever find again. He made me laugh even when I️ forgot how. He barely knew me but he held me while I️ cried the night my brother died. 

But he was evil. He manipulated me, he beat me, he hurt me. By the end waking up next to him filled me with fear. He was a drug dealer who got me hooked on coke and every day I️ did his job. I️ was terrified. His voice made me flinch. He would call me chunky when I️ was so very much not. He blamed me for everything. 

And yet, every day I’ve spent away from him I’ve felt worse. The night I️ left I️ screamed at my parents begging them to make the pain stop. I️ can’t stop thinking, ‘ya I️ was miserable with him, but what if it’s not any better without him?’ 

The thing is, I’ve been sober for 30 days today. My sleep schedule is mostly normal these days, and right now I’m drinking a cup of coffee and watching the sunrise which I️ never did with him. My brain feels slightly less foggy each day and I️ can feel a weight lifting off of me day by day. 
I️ left the state I️ grew up in to get away from him and I’m somewhere so much more beautiful then I’ve ever been before. "
"I warned my roommate not to train my parrot to do things for pistachios. I warned him...she doesn't do tricks. She's too smart. She will follow you around and continue to the things you ""teach"" until you're insane. I warned him. Play with her. Make games. Do not do tricks for treats.

Well. He didn't listen. He taught her to flip the light switch for pistachios. Every room she's in now can become a techno rave of blinking lights and her making dripping noises. She's doing it right now. 

WHAT DID WE LEARN, SHAYNE?! WHAT THE FUCK DID WE LEARN?!"
"Had to go to the OBGYN in his country... Before I spoke the language. I had him sit outside the cracked door (no WAY was I going to let him watch the exam) while I shouted to him TELL HER THE FIRST DAY OF MY LAST PERIOD WAS X and TELL HER I'VE HAD THIS IUD FOR 6 YEARS.

I'll never forget that."
"Jumpstart a car. 
Saddest part, it was a bunch of women who were all like “oh geez, we need to call the boys to help us now. We’re otherwise stuck.”
Like they all assumed none of us knew how to jumpstart a car. 

It’s the most simple thing. I was like “you got the cables in your car?”
“Yeah, I have everything! I just dunno how.”
“Give them to me.”
And the proceeded to give orders around. "
"Considering yourself to be attractive.  If a pretty girl or a handsome guy knows that they are attractive, it's often seen as them being ""shallow"".  There is this whole idealized cute thing about how a beautiful girl shouldn't know she's beautiful--she should just consider herself to be ugly/plain and not believe that she is attractive, while people around her shake their heads and go, ""she's so beautiful but she just doesn't see it!""

  I guess it's because something like looks relate closely to genetics and it's seen as not being ""fair""?"
"I've said before that I thought she is a terrible ""feminist"" and I stand by my words. Apparently we should believe all women except women who accuse her friends.

I understand that it can be hard to believe that someone you know, trust, and love could do something like that but her response proves to me that she's only out for herself. "

"I have a gorgeous white dress that I look fabulous in. So fabulous, in fact, that I cannot wear it without getting catcalled. It came to the point that I felt insecure in it, so I no longer wear it outside. I wear it at home sometimes though and feel gorgeous for a few hours."
"Dude friend wouldn't let me wash and bandage a cut he got because 'girls faint if they see blood'.

"s was a case of karma working perfectly in my favour.

When I first moved to London to attend university I got into a relationship with a guy. Which was very up and down to say the least, but tbh the amount we were drinking and partying at that time it wasn't surprising. A common source of contention in the relationship was a girl he had been involved with before me, I always had my suspicions but was always made to feel like I was just being 'psycho'.

A few months into the relationship, my boyfriend had to move back to his home town due to money troubles but planned to move back to London when he had saved enough money. And his friends had promised to chip in and help him back on his feet.

In the time we were long distance the arguing about his ex became less of an issue. And as gesture of good will to their friend his friendship group took me under their wing and looked out for me when he wasn't there.

Me and his friends became incredibly close. And when the truth finally came out that he was still sleeping with his ex gf in the early part of our relationship, I was terrified I would lose the great friends i had made through him. 

So the day after when we were all on a night out. I came clean about the whole thing to them. Now these guys are very ladish and very ""Bros before hoes"". So I was completely taken aback when they all agreed ""nah fuck him, you are really great person and don't deserve that at all"". 

They all refused to speak to him from them on, none of them were willing to help him to move back and get on his feet. Last I heard he was still stuck in his hometown and i'm still best friends with the guys i met through him.

That relationship was one of the worst things that ever happened to me, going out with a narcisissist can completely break you. But it was definitely worth it for the great friendships I gained from it.  "
"For people who live in snowy places that have to deal with clearing it themselves, I can't recommend highly enough the ""Touch Plow"" app.  It's like Uber but for someone to come plow your driveway for you and shovel one of your walkways.  "
It's going to take a looooooooooooooot longer than the few weeks / months when this has 'suddenly' come to light.
"Lack of empathy. I'm a very ""feeling"" person and I crave strong emotional connection in a relationship. I chalked it up to him being a guy and not being good at emotions (especially with his troubled past). It was especially hard when I had a miscarriage. Not only did my baby die, but I almost died too because I hemorrhaged. No support whatsoever, just shame whenever I felt upset about it.  
  
I learned to cope with it by convincing myself that he was just bad at expressing his emotions. I continued to do this for several years. Eventually, he trained me to believe that my emotional responses were inappropriate and that I was the problem.  
  
Did it end up being a big deal in the end? Yes. Even if he hadn't done all the fucked up things he did, it was a major incompatibility between us. On a larger scale, it was also a huge, flashing red flag of an abuser. "
"I get a few massages a month. I’m a photographer (hence the name haha) and I absolutely kill my back regularly. 

After a 10 hour wedding day it feels like a bus has hit me. I’m only 32 years old, but after a wedding it’s common for me to hobble out of bed hunched over like and 80 year old. So I get regular massages. It’s honestly my saving grace and it’s one thing I would never give up no matter how much I’m trying to save. 

I strongly believe in massage. It’s good for the body and mind. It’s more than just physical, it’s spiritually aligning and keeps me sane. Meditative almost. "
"Worked in a Comcast call center ages ago doing tech support. Guy demanded to talk to a man because everyone knows women can't do tech support. I refused, had him unplug his cable box and plug it back in. He was grumbling the entire time about how this won't work because I'm a woman and don't know what I'm doing.

It worked."
"I was SUPER sick. And he was rubbing my back while I vomited. I vomited so hard I peed. 

That was not a good day. "
"Pay for a date. Since the beginning of our relationship, bf and I have taken turns paying for dates. I have literally had the dinner check taken out of my hand by waiters who refuse (in a very condescending manner) to *allow* me to buy dinner for the sexy man sitting across the table from me. It's always done under the guise of ""don't you want to be romanced and treated well?"" Hell yeah, but *paying* for dinner is not the romance..."

"Make-up. I don't even normally wear make-up, but I get SO annoyed at people judging women who wear a lot of make-up. I don't get why make-up is seen as shallow and self-centered, but tattoos are cool and edgy.

Oh, wait. I think I know why."
Not often enough 
"Some people seem to think having any sort of physical attraction requirement is shallow, which isn't really accurate. But trying to be with someone you're not attracted to is a losing battle. "
"Everything women stereotypically like. Such as a pumpkin spice latte. That's so shallow right? Starbucks is such a basic bitch breeding ground amirite? And leggings and Ugg boots. Those women are so basic and their interests are so shallow, amirite? No. When a product or activity or style is liked by men, it's cool or a sign of higher intellect. Take craft beer for example. It's a beverage, like a pumpkin spice latte, but since a lot of men tend to like this, it is considered a cool thing to like.  People who know a lot about it just have an interesting hobby. And when a masculine guy humorously confesses to liking pumpkin spice lattes, he is seen as being ""confident in his masculinity"". When you are at a party and see every dude in a similar plaid flannel with those cuffed, tight jeans, that's cool, those guys are attractive. When a group of ""basic bitches"" are all in leggings and Uggs, they're vapid and can't think for themselves. Give me a break. This bothers me so much. God forbid we like what we like because it tastes good, is comfortable, keeps us warm, whatever. Women can't have nice things without being called shallow. Rant over. "
"For me, that item is my Mass Effect t-shirt I bought years ago.  
I used to play a lot of Mass Effect and I really liked it, so I bought the simple N7 stripe-sleeve t-shirt. I wore it once to work at the campus bookstore and some guy started following me around the store. OK, weird, but he's not preventing me from doing my job so whatever. Guy decides to strike up a conversation about my shirt. OK, acceptable. Guy asks me what character I like the best. I say Mordin Solus. Guy exclaims that that's so weird, most women love Garrus. He goes on to explain that most women love Garrus because they want to fuck him. Do I want to fuck the bipedal lizard man? I backpedal and try to explain that I do not want to fuck the alien amphibian reptile creature, I just like him as a character. He smirks and scoffs. I retire the shirt from public use as to not invite another similar conversation on the future."
Lena Dunham is trash. She proves it time and time again. 
"The first time he went down on me I farted in his face. 

A few years into the relationship I got food poisoning and had to lay down on the floor in the middle of taking a shit because I couldn’t sit up anymore. Threw up all over floor. He came in to take care of me with my pants around my ankles, poop still in the toilet, throw up on the floor. Couldn’t have been pretty.

"
Because the common folk do not share my **vision**.
I don't but I think it's maybe an American thing with the exclusivity. That's just the assumed default here.
"This happened to me too! I needed a barbell and they were all on the other side of the room. I go pick one up and this dude rushes in like he just NEEDS to help me carry it.

Bro. It's an EMPTY barbell. You realize I'm about to put EVEN MORE weight on it and then pick it up AGAIN? On PURPOSE?"
I have a t-shirt that my daughter bought me for Mother’s Day a year or 2 ago and I wear it in the house but I can’t bring myself to wear it outside. It’s black with a galaxy print on the front and a giant cat head in the middle. 
"An honest, and helpful explanation with as little drama as possible. Painful is fine as long as it’s not done on purpose "
"Putting effort into how you look. Generally speaking, I realize there are some naturally gorgeous outliers, but you get treated way better when you try to look good. "
"**A menstrual cup:**

I only have to empty it out twice a day (I had to switch out tampons every time I had to pee.

"Dunham's the sort of self professed feminist that makes a lot of women hesitant to describe themselves as feminists, lest they automatically be associated with trash like her."
"I've posted this story before.

I was eating tortilla chips at a restaurant. Swallowed a chip and suddenly started feeling intense pain in my chest that kept getting worse and worse by the second...then suddenly I woke up to my husband splashing water in my face. I had passed out from the pain. So I went to the ER to be sure it wasn't anything serious. Esophageal spasm was my official diagnosis. Basically the chip got lodged somewhere after I swallowed it and I fainted from the pain. My husband is sworn to secrecy that a tortilla chip landed me in the ER. Pretty embarrassing."
"yes, i was the victim. just yesterday i was approached by the one woman i told, who sought out my permission to tell the rest of his (female) friends. she told me that watching him get a hero's welcome would make her sick especially after the hollywood purge.

"Once back in 8th grade, A boy tried to tell me what periods were. A BOY. I told him I knew what a period was and what to expect. He asked, and I quote, “HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW?”

I have a Dark Souls t-shirt that I love to death but won't wear in public because unfortunately the kind of people that will stop me to talk to me about it are the exact kind of fans that I don't want to be talking to about it
"It feels like every day there's an article ragging on millenials. Sorry for being born I guess. I'm absolutely not  ashamed of my situation. I'm in generation rent, generation of stagnant wages and have a lower quality of life than my parents did at my age. But I have nothing to be ashamed if because I work hard and do good, it's not my fault the housing market is stacked against young people. I even enjoy avocado toast from time to time. "
"A friend stated it as ""Lena Dunham is not a feminist; she is a Lenaist.""

She's unconcerned about others, especially if those needs keep her from her wants."
"I stopped wearing shirts for my favorite college football team. When I was a kid I spent my football season weekends at games, whether at home or away. I watch most games on tv and still try to go to see a game each season. I've gotten enough shit for not known enough about current players, not knowing stats about old players, and not going to that school that I just don't wear them out anymore.

I also had a dress I really loved with an exposed back. I was standing outside and some guy ran his hand from the top of my back to my butt. That's all I could think of when I tried to wear it again. So grody."
"I refuse to date someone who is dating other people, so... the first date?"
"Eating more than my allotted portion of food. When I got a summer job landscaping for my dad as a teen, my dad had to write out the math to show my mom that the job resulted in me burning twice as many calories as she was allowing me to eat before she started to let me take more food. 

Now I'm a food writer, which she finds really distasteful. Too bad!"
"I realize most people when inexperienced, will do what helps them reach orgasm, assuming what works on them will work on you.

E.g. an ex gave me the best slow, sensual, blowjobs for what felt like forever, but for me and most men, even though it feels amazing,, that alone won't get us over the edge. We need that fast finish.

So that's why he's hammering your clit. If a guy says that he's close to orgasm, you should increase your pace and tighten your grip. Men find it hard to learn that if a woman is close to orgasm, you should continue exactly what you're doing; like holding a boat down a stream."
"My entire job. I'm end user technical support, a computer hardware expert, and data recovery specialist.

"This question assumes the predators in question understand that what they're doing/they've done is wrong, but I would posit that many of them don't believe they've done anything wrong. This is all anecdotal on my part, but I know many of my sexual abusers don't believe they've done anything wrong."
I have this tight mini skirt but it's a lil too tight and a lil too mini so it stays in my closet and occasionally comes out when I'm playing dressup. 
"I'm not very good at asking people how they're doing.

I'm so wrapped up it in my own life and what's going on that I tend to... forget. It's selfish and awful and I'm working very hard on it."
"Primer. I used to think it was just an extra that was unnecessary. My makeup looks so much better and I don't have to redo it if I'm going out in the evening because my makeup has stayed on since morning.
Also finishing spray. For the same reason. Together they are a dream"
"My husband and I are working together to budget every month. Since we got married a few years ago I've let him mostly handle our finances so I can focus on other things around the house. So me being involved more with the financial process is... stressful... on Hubby.

"I'm a software developer.

I went to college at 18 and got a degree but nothing ever came of it. After working in a cruddy job for 2 years I went back to school at 24 and got a second degree in computer science.

At 27, I finally have health insurance. It's super neat."
"Anything and everything that girls/women like. People will find a way to be dismissive of anything that is popular among women because it couldn't possible have any ""real"" value."
Play drums for metal songs. Evidently you have to be an absolutely ripped and at least 300 pound man to do that. For some reason.

"Former friend, emphasis on the former, cheated on her husband, who me and my husband were also friends with. Had it just been the one slip up, I would’ve let it go. But two days after she told me she cheated, I overheard her on the phone with her “special friend” and it was very obvious it’d become an affair. But before I could even work up the nerve to tell her husband, he found out himself. 


Next thing I know, SHE has taken out a restraining order on her husband, claiming he’s abusive. He has nowhere to go and ends up living with us for a month. An investigation follows into the domestic violence charge, which ends up being completely unfounded. A court battle ensues over their two year old son and things start falling apart for her. He was financially stable with a good job, she was getting let go from her job and put on disability. His credit was decent, hers was shot. When things started looking bad, she suddenly, in court, accuses her husband of rape. A couple months later she announces she’s pregnant with another man’s baby. 


We’re still friends with the husband and he’s happily engaged to a wonderful woman. He won full custody of his son, and she only is able to see him alternating holidays and six weeks over the summer.  Karma really caught up with her on that one"
"He lost for l his agent, FX producer/writer contract (4 shows), and his movie premiere was cancelled. I'd say he was punished in the entertainment world in the short run. Time will tell. "

"My ex saw me eat a bit of deodorant off of his bed because I was in bed, eating a Cameo cookie (or 10) and thought I dropped some cream from the cookie."
"Pretty much any time I am not at work or have social obligations. 

I am lazy as hell. My life pretty much centers around finding the balance between the maximum amount of comfort for the least amount of effort.

I have my 9-5 job that pays my bills and gives me enough to have fun. I have no interest in the stress of working constantly. It's a big reason I am childfree. I need my downtime to stay sane and balanced. I cannot imagine being happy with every minute scheduled and accounted for. I am happiest when left to my own devices.

I feel zero guilt for relaxing."
I'm always trying to get the guys in my life to wear sunscreen. 
"Good tupperware/ food storage thingies. I meal-prep and the difference in how much better a meal tastes if it's stored well is astounding. 10/10.

Also, custom made/ specialty clothing. I'm 6' and once I admitted that most stores' clothes don't fit me, I pay more, but things last longer and look better."
"Right? My husband and I went into a Radio Shack so I could pick up an antenna mast to install some wireless equipment for my parents. The saleswoman kept asking my husband all the questions, which I would in turn answer. He finally got frustrated and said, “You need to ask my wife. She’s the network engineer.”  She turned partially towards me, directed her attention down at my son in his stroller and said, “Well, I see she engineered a cute little baby.”
So now that’s our catch phrase. Keeps me entertained. That way I’m less prone to stabbing. "
"Small talk. While I'm not always the biggest fan of it, it definitely has its place in sociolinguistics and is often a key cultural marker and a piece of building interpersonal connections. 

I still don't want to talk about how my weekend was though, Sheryl."
"""Do you have an orgasm when you use a tampon because it's like sex?"" It's shown up on badwomensanatomy a few times."
" When I was a bartender, my husband bought me this amazing shirt for work that says ""Show me your tits and I'll open your beer"" with a bottle opener built into the hem. 

It was a hit at the bar. I saw way to many man boobs, but quite a few from the ladies and my tips increased dramatically. 

Now if I wear it in public, guys make comments like ""Hey baby, what do I get if I open your beer?"" Or about wanting to see me make out with another girl. I've even been told I'm going to hell for being bisexual.

It sucks because it is the most comfortable shirt I've ever worn. "

"I think it's because confidence in women is seen as obnoxious. Women are supposed to be small and quiet and modest. We're also supposed to need men, and for the men who subscribe to traditional gender roles (and, you know, sexism in general) that means relying on them for our sense of self-worth. We're supposed to be beautiful, but we can't *know* we're beautiful before they tell us. God forbid we have self-confidence independently of men."
"This year Canada has set boundaries for a massive marine conservation area around Lancaster Sound, in the territory of Nunuvut! It will be over 131,000 square kilometres, which is ten times larger than our next biggest marine conservation area, and no oil drilling or other seismic testing will be allowed in the region. It's really great because the federal government worked for years with the local Inuit population to create the boundaries and help protect the traditions and ways of life for the local population.  
  
There are many species of whales, along with walrus, polar bear and other marine animals that will be protected in the conservation area - for example, 75% of the global narwhal population lives in the area (at least part of the year), and 20% of belugas. It gets us closer to our 2020 goal of preserving 10% of our coastal and marine waters.

Being too rough with hands! I've had so many guys just paw at my vulva with their sharp nails and grabby fingers that I just don't like being fingered anymore. Nails scratch and calluses can be painful. Be GENTLE with your hands!!!!
"I typically pay all the time, mostly as a function of joint bank accounts/credit cards and my wallet/purse being more easily accessible than his wallet. But I’d say at least 75% of the time the server drops the check off in front of my husband. I pick it up immediately, put in the card and hand it to the server. Who goes, runs it, and returns it. To my husband. "
"Happy to call myself a feminist, not happy to hear the words""Lena Dunham"". Seriously, she's a narcissist who fights for Lena's rights, not Womens' rights. "
"I agree. Finances are one of the biggest causes of divorce.

Also, not just how much they make but also how they spend and save it. There are a lot of people who make a very good salary, but spend so frivolously that they have no savings and live paycheck to paycheck because of it. "
"Vinegar. I use vinegar for cleaning my house, killing fruit flies and sometimes if I have smelly clothes/shoes. It kills bateria, is natural and cheap. Baking soda also has a ton of awesome cleaning properties. 

(Also, I can totally see that I'm in an North American thread by all the baby wipe recs, which is kind of funny to me. Nowhere else in the world is baby wipes such a big thing.)"
"She goes overboard with the whole ""shake a paw"" thing

She learned how to shake a paw and that was really cute. We'd give her some treats for it. Now every time any of us has food, she waves her paw around nonstop like ""look at me shaking my paw, give me food"". She'll hit people's legs and arms and generally just keep waving her paw around until someone pays attention to her

I love her so much, she makes me so happy"
"Honestly just staying with my ex after I found out he cheated. The cheating alone sucked, but it was awful that I had suspicions and asked about this person several times. It went on for months, and he had no issue lying right to my face that whole time. 

The hardest thing to cope with was being so absolutely heart broken, and not being able to turn to the person you love for comfort. It was like I needed him more than ever, but I couldn’t have him, even though he was right there. For me, there was no fixing that, and I probably should have left him sooner. "
Holy fuck this... and it sucks when you go numb because it's absolutely impossible to cum for a good minute 😒
"My late Dad's best friend told me he noticed I have mannerisms like my father, especially when I tell a story.  It made me happy, b/c I love and miss my Dad so much."

"The same things make him *right* and *wrong* for me, because we are very, very different.

His extrovertedness is a challenge, but at the same time it balances my introvertedness. We dislike each other's favorite foods, he is the furthest thing from PC, he's a dog person, he gets lonely easily, his hobbies could not be more different from mine... 

No one understands. I don't understand. We're all wrong for each other, but it works."
My stance? I'll lift one leg up and sometimes pull one cheek away from the other
"I feel like anytime I see posts like this asking men what women's clothing item is really unattractive, one of the top answers is always high waisted pants/shorts. I fucking love high waisted bottoms on women. Almost all my jeans and shorts are high waisted. I just think they elongate the legs and make people look taller. "
"The Captain Underpants movie. 

Captain Underpants saved my life.

No, really, I'm dead serious. 

I had nearly committed suicide the week before this film came out. 

Shit hit the fan for me my last semester at college, which was the WORST time, because I was an animator completing my senior thesis short for graduation. Long story short, I didn't finish, didn't get the degree. 

My lifelong dreams of becoming an animator were dashed. For maybe 48 hours the only thing keeping me from pulling the trigger was utter exhaustion and the courtesy of not leaving a corpse in my friend's apartment. (I was more or less homeless at the time dealing with college housing and a jack-off roommate nbd.)

I'm glad I didn't though. Because I saw this movie. And I LAUGHED. I laughed harder than I laughed at anything in years. I was lifted up from extreme sadness juxtaposed with such a pure movie. Such great translation of design, such great animation and voice work. Fantastically written, with such reverence for the source material. This film could have EASILY been dismissed, but there was so much heart that I couldn't help but be enamored. 

Captain Underpants, this silly little kids film, 
celebrating the arts and the power of laughter, reminded me of all the reasons I love animation, and all the reasons I wanted to be an animator. If I can help even one person the way this film helped me, then that would be enough. 

So Tra-la-la Captain Underpants crew, I'm still going, thanks to you. "
"My best friends' now husband had the same thought when they first started dating. He asked why she was wearing a pad to bed and she was all ""obviously so I don't bleed all over the bed"". Apparently he was aghast and said ""but it's not time for periods its time for sleep!"" "

Like, if you're out and you get a migraine, they take the edge off so you can drive home. If you need to sleep to get rid of it, they take the edge off so you can get to sleep. They're amazing. 

I keep recommending them to people and they just laugh cos it looks like a sanitary pad stuck to your head but those people are seriously missing out. "
Wear jeans! Seriously someone once told me that jeans were for men and I shouldn’t wear them because I’m a woman.

I am working towards a leadership position now in my office, but just because I think it'd be interesting, not because the pay or prestige would increase much. I have no interest in running the department or being the chief editor someplace. I get to work, plug in my headphones, and away I go.

"...maybe. I had an ex that just didn't get it when it came to proper dress at different events. ""Why do I have to wear something other than this bright green promotional t-shirt to your happy hour downtown with your friends? If they care about something like that, aren't they being shallow?""

Well...maybe. But if all my friends think you have the maturity of a 7 year old, and everyone else at the bar is giving you (and me) looks for being severely underdressed, yeah, I care what others think.  "
I like wearing them. I just wish they weren't so expensive. 
"My cousin sent a letter to my grandfather saying that he'd abused him as a child (the abuse is stuff that was unfortunately normal discipline at the time but is now considered abuse) and that if grandfather went to my auntie's 60th birthday, cousin wouldn't attend.

So then my other cousin's (different parents) announced that the first cousin had sexually abused them throughout their childhoods, and how dare he claim the moral high ground with this on his conscience. 

Now half the family doesn't speak to the other half. It's awful."

They’d also likely be millennial, so it would probably be set in queens or Brooklyn rather than Manhattan.

I completely agree with you! Attraction and attractiveness are 2 different things. It is shallow to care what other people thing about your partner instead of how you feel about them

"A lot of people don't understand why these girls didn't give up everything to make their accusations immediately because they don't understand how often women are faced with sexual harassment and assault. If we had to give up our jobs, our careers, our hopes, our dreams, our friends, and our privacy every time we faced sexual harassment or assault, we literally couldn't function in society. At a certain point you not only get used to it, but you have no choice.

You got harassed as an actor, you quit and get another job, you get harassed there, do you quit and get another job? What about when you get harassed at the pharmacy? You find another pharmacy? Then if you get harassed at that one, do you find another one? If you get harassed on the subway, do you stop taking the subway? If you get harassed on the street, do you stop leaving your house? You get harassed on the internet, do you stop using the internet?

It's practically impossible to live a life where you've not been sexually harassed so you just learn to take it. At a certain point, you think if I'm going to get sexually harassed at work, it might as well be work I love. What are the alternatives? To live in an ISIS style society where you're covered from head to to in black and not allowed to leave your house with a male escort? At a certain point you think, yeah, it sucks that guys show me their dick without my permission but it doesn't suck as not having the personal freedom and independence.

To be clear, that's not an excuse either. You can't say, ""well at least we don't force you to wear a burqa and you're allowed to drive a car."" Just because your situation is less shitty doesn't mean it isn't shitty and you should be okay with it. We should constantly be trying to make the world less shitty than it is regardless of how shitty it used to be. If you're standing in three feet of dung and someone removes two feet of it, are you going to stop asking for the last foot of dung to be removed because hey, at least it's not three feet?"

"I don't particularly like wearing bras, but I feel like I have to. I wish it were more socially acceptable to not wear one. I've taken to mostly wearing a sleep type bra when I have to. But it still kind of shows my nipples ,which I think is the socially unacceptable part. People are scared or something of women's nipples. I actually like winter because can wear a sweater or hoodie and no one can tell I'm not wearing a bra."
"I've stopped wearing any bra that isn't a sports bra, and I only wear those while I'm exercising. I'm probably buying too cheap/the wrong size, but 'normal' bras are so uncomfortable. I don't really care about people's opinions of my boob choices so I just let the gals hang free."
"I pee every single time I vomit (which happens a lot because I have gastroparesis) it's gotten to a point now where I take off my pants and put a dirty towel down in front of the toilet.

I even make sure to sit on the toilet and pee as much as I can before I swap positions and throw up in the toilet, but my bladder still manages to find some urine hiding in the corner or something. It's really annoying. "
"During my brief attempt at therapy, I was complaining that my coworkers don't know me well at all. My therapist said:

""Well, they're not really trying to get to know you. And they'd have to, because you're a hard person to get to know, aren't you?""

Had to admit both are true. I'm an open book in a lot of ways, because I'm open about a lot of stuff other people don't like to talk about, but I keep the stuff that does matter to me real close to the vest."
"Not a woman personally, but when I worked at a ski resort, a woman was removing the cover for a beginner lift by herself as she typically does every day.  One day the normal supervisor was out so they had someone else supervising the morning.  This supervisor called out over the radio ""who let a female remove the lid by herself?  Shouldn't someone be helping her?""  This girl replied over the radio ""I can bench 200, what's your limit?""  The supervisor didn't say another word to her all day."

"Having to support both of us.

My ex was chronically unemployed, due to a combination of physical ailments, bipolar disorder, and an overall lack of the maturity needed to exist in the adult sphere. I was the only one making any money or contributing to the household in any way for just under two years. 

I felt like I had to put up with it because it was ""unfair"" to break up with someone that I knew couldn't support themselves without me. In retrospect, fuck that. It was a HUGE strain on my own mental health and I never should've stayed in that relationship as long as I did."
"I don't understand why the media latched on to her as this ""voice of a generation""/""voice of modern feminism"" in the first place. I just don't think she's that talented to begin with. Her show is a bunch of spoiled, well-off, white brats who lead directionless lives and learn nothing from their fuckups. That's the stereotype of millennials and as a millennial myself, most of the people I know are hardworking young people just trying to make it in the world. 

There are plenty of other women in the media who I think do a better job of representing feminism so I don't understand why she of all people is the one who's been chosen to represent it. "
"Our dog tries to follow after us when we leave the house. We feel bad, so we say ""sorry!"" whenever she tries to follow out the door. 

Now whenever she starts following us to the door, as soon as we say ""sorry!"", she stops dead in her tracks, sits down, watches us leave. To her, ""sorry"" just means ""you can't come."" Makes me feel like a bad person."

"I don't need a detailed reason for your rejection. All I'm asking is that if I'm hitting you up for another date, you be honest and say, ""Sorry, I'd rather not""  than lie about being busy or straight up blocking my number without a word. 

I've been shitty about ghosting people in the past, then a guy I really liked blocked my number without a word. It felt so awful and from then on I never ghosted anyone without at least saying ,""sorry, not interested! Good luck!"""

"Oh man I got this--and it's wholesome as fuck.

In high school I had two best friends--we're all girls. The first friend, Kay, and the second, Mel, 

One night, Kay and I were hanging out and her mom bought us booze, so for the first we get drunk, and head over to the nearby elementary school playground to swing because what else were we gonna do? Long story short, we ended up discussing our uncertain sexuality, and we made out/left hickies on one another. 

The next day, Mel sees mine and asks for the low-down. I tell her, and she gets really quiet. Turned out she was extremely jealous. She told me she'd had a crush on Kay for a while but had been too afraid to hurt their friendship if she didn't feel the same. I swore up and down I wouldn't tell Kay.

Some time later, Kay tells me she's got a huge crush on Mel, but swears me to secrecy. Even though I could see no real harm coming from telling them they liked each other, I kept the confidence, because they were both so agitated over it. 

Some time after *that*, Kay and I get into a fight. I don't know what about, but we were emailing furiously back and forth--long, involved letters recounting unspoken grievances and the like. At one point during this, Kay accuses me of being unable to keep my mouth shut/keep secrets, and to refute this I reminded her of the longstanding crush she had on Mel.

Shortly after that exchange, Kay and I make a wary truce and end up going to the mall. On the bus, she checks her phone and suddenly drops to the floor on her knees, clearly distraught. It turns out, she had been forwarding our email-fight to Mel, basically in a ""can you believe this bitch?"" sort of way (I don't blame her, the 3 of us always involved each other in the others drama). Of course, she forwarded Mel the email describing Kay's long standing crush. 

At this point I was happy and relieved to relate to Kay that Mel also had a crush on her; it was a secret I'd kept the entire year or so, and I was quite happy to assure Kay. 

They dated for 2 years, parted amicably, continued the friendship, and Kay was maid of honor for Mel's wedding. :)"
"IME it's being attracted to fit men, or at least, semi-fit.  It's my lifestyle, it's what I like and I've tried dating heavyset and/or sedentary men and they can't hang.  One guy I thought was going to die on a hike, a mild hike at that, it was more like a stroll through a rolling wooded area.  My last serious boyfriend was muscular and was fit, but not in a cardiovascular way.  He had zero interest in taking walks, running, hiking or learning how to ski or anything.  Getting his ass off the couch was next to impossible, fuck that.  He was nice to look at, but that was it.  So I've stayed single for over a year because it's just irritating realizing at 47 there is a serious shortage of men I'm interested in (not just looks).  I get flak IRL and told I'm ""too picky"", no I'm too fucking old to waste any more time on men that don't share my favorite activities.  "

"Best friend in college had no local family and one hell of a manipulative piece of shit boyfriend. Every time he would cheat on her she would come crying and stay at my place until he begged her back. I moved her out of his house 3 times into mine. I begged her to leave him, she wouldn't. 

One day i had my own shit to deal with and desperately needed her. She was no where to be found. A few days later I found out she had moved back into his house for the 4th time and I snapped. Not only did I change my phone number, I also moved - Never to speak to her again.

10 years later I'm at a Red Sox game and one her old friends recognizes me. She fills me on on her life, and tells me my actions were the best thing that happened to her. As predicted, she caught him cheating again. Except this time she had no where to go, so she moved to FL where he father was. Met a dude, married with 3 kids now. 

We reconnected after the Red Sox game, both apologized to each other. We aren't close as we were before because she's so far away but we stay in touch. I'll never regret my actions, in fact she thanked me."
"I love angry sex! For us it typically happens after we've 'resolved' an issue but we are still kind of pissed at each other.

It's this raw explosion of passion and an excuse to be selfish during sex - kind of like both of us caring about only our own pleasure which then just ends up feeling really great for both of us.

Then afterwards we cuddle and actually try and resolve whatever issue we were fighting about."
I remember back in secondary school my friends wanted to plan an outing to the water park and the guys planning asked one of the girls which day would our periods be so they could block that date out. They thought every girls' periods came on the same day haha! 
"From a PR standpoint it's definitely a more effective statement than many of the others we've seen. But like, the guy apologized when he got caught, and caught in such a way that there was no plausible way to wiggle out of it. 

He knows there's been rumors out for a while, and he's definitely not so stupid that up until this point he thought all the women were cool with it. It wasn't in his best interest to apologize then because people didn't believe the rumors. Now people do, so it benefits him to release this sort of statement.

So the long and short of it is that, in my opinion it's basically meaningless. "

Virginia just elected the first transgender state legislator who was running against the author of the bathroom privacy bill.  There are a lot of issues in our current social and political climate but that makes me feel so hopeful.

C.K. gives an interview to the New York Times after his film I Love You, Daddy — which sees the comedian play a screenwriter whose teenage daughter starts dating a 68-year-old filmmaker, in what seems a clear nod to Woody Allen — premieres at Toronto. As in his conversation with Vulture, the comedian declines to address the allegations head-on. “I’m not going to answer to that stuff, because they’re rumors,” he says. “If you actually participate in a rumor, you make it bigger and you make it real.” He says he doesn’t understand why Notaro talked about him to the Daily Beast: “I don’t know why she said the things she’s said … I don’t think talking about that stuff in the press and having conversations over press lanes is a good idea.”

Also, on a more political note - Germany passing marriage equality. It was such an emotional day; I set an alarm and everything, and I sat on my bed watching the vote in real time, together with a lot of friends all over Germany and, in some cases, the world. We were all so stoked, and so excited. Til the very the end I was afraid it wouldn't pass (Brexit and Trump happened, after all!). When it did I cried, because at least one of the politicians behind it has been campaigning for it for 20 years. 

The first week or so of October was great, too - because at that point, people could finally marry, so there were loads of wedding pics of very happy same-sex couples in Germany. :) "

"I have a shirt, its from a brand called revival, they do retro style stuff, and its got a deep v neck. I loved it so much i bought it in 4 different colours. But last time I wore it, I was riding my bike and a guy leaned out his car window and screamed ""NICE TITS"" at me (i was riding on the road, so he was about a meter from my face), and I haven't been able to wear them since. This was over a year ago. I also haven't ridden my bike since. :("
"Math. I think in English normally, but whenever numbers are involved I think them in Mandarin. It's difficult to think of numbers in English for me - I have to pause and translate them or write them down first and then read them out. "
"The DARE program at school made me believe that I’d constantly get offered drugs. Sadly, I do not. "
"That real sex is exactly like porn. You don't even know how many guys expect me to do anal, think that pulling my hair turns me on, etc. "
"The same thing happened to a friend of mine, except she was in college and a guy taking the same course as she tried to explain to her that periods only last for four days and there is no way it could last longer than that. We were both stunned to say the least. "
"Because adults are complex and dating is complex, and if you close off opportunities with other people because you had 1 single date with a stranger, you will kick yourself later for not at least keeping things open and seeing how things could go. 

It is common to realize by date 2-5 that things may not work out, and then what? You've already shut off dating opportunities with others.

It's not uncommon, as a mature adult, to just try to meet people, and see how things go."
"I once saw a squirrel carrying a full cheeseburger, in the wrapper from the fast food restaurant, in his hands while running on two legs. It was insane. His face was crazy happy, like scarily happy, and he was just booking it. I thought my friends would think it was amazing/hilarious (which it was) but when I told the story I got the sense they thought I had embellished. I had not. 

Repeat: I saw a squirrel running on two legs and carrying an ENTIRE cheeseburger. Also, it was the best day of his life. "
"I'm not surprised. Creative output aside, she seems bent on showing the world that she's a garbage human. "
"Get a job and stick to it, no matter where it is it how marginal it is. If you really need to quit, have something lined up first. 

Most importantly, if every job seems to make you depressed as fuck, tell a fucking therapist. "
"An old college friend (29M) of mine raped a girl (19) who he was training/mentoring. As much as I hate to admit it, I didn't believe it at first. I thought she could be lying, there was no way he was capable of this, he was just *such a nice guy*. I felt this way because he once came onto me thinking I was interested in him romantically; when I turned him down (we were alone in my apartment, no less) he was very apologetic and respectful. As it turns out, he really did rape this poor girl and is currently serving a 3 year sentence in prison. I still feel awful for victim-blaming and being part of the rape culture problem, but from now on you can bet I'm believing anyone who has the courage to come forward against their abuser. Even the""nice guys"" can be capable of doing horrible things."
"Media teaches men that the worst thing you could do as a dude is cum too quick. I was very concerned as a child. Besides worrying that I would cum too quick, I was also insanely nervous about getting aids from mosquitos. And after the first few times I had any kind of sexual contact, I was sure I had aids. Soooo that’s the kind of kid I was.

Now as an adult, I’m much more sexually liberal, but holy sheeht I take too long. It’s really upsetting. I’m sure it’s a mental thing, but about half the time I fake it if my partner doesn’t know about me, or if I remembered to say something beforehand, I’ll be like “eeehh... enoughs enough” lol and then we can just hang out.

I mean, sex isn’t entirely about orgasms, but I’m super jealous of guys that cum every time. I know that’s pretty shitty of me, but again, the expectation drilled into my brainwashed mind is that guys cum if you move your hips a little, so it’s something i gotta get over. Ah well."
"It freaks me out how much this happens. I work in the same field and I can listen to calls of a male colleague and despite me saying all the same exact things, I get a lot of push back from older male customers. Do they assume I don't know what I'm doing? Why do they blindly comply with a male voice over the phone and not a female voice? Fucking weird."
Every time I see that word I read it as baklava so I thought you were being funny by saying you were wearing pastry and honey in public.
"It's mostly stuff that I couldn't do but my younger brother was allowed to do. They'd tell me it wasn't safe  but then years later my brother would ask and he'd be allowed. Like play videogames, go skateboarding, go fishing, run around and play in the dirt, go to the shopping centre by myself as a teenager etc."
"&gt; ""Nah man I got bored a while ago - I'm just here for you at this point.""

"Not to fall in love with a person's potential. Ask yourself, can you be happy with this person as they are now? If the answer is no, it's time to really rethink things because if you wait for things to change, chances are you'll be waiting forever. "
"I'm doing it for female attention. 

Guys don't know how hard this perfect wing is to achieve. They can't appreciate it. Ladies do

Also, I want to date women. "
"I'm a nurse. My tattoos are covered by my scrubs, but I have a cherry red streak in my hair. As far as I know, it hasn't been much of an issue for my career. My elderly patients love it, actually."
"""Its not good sex if she can still walk afterwards"" 

UM NO"
Sometimes you just don't. But generally you try to develop coping strategies that help. One that helps me is not thinking 'I need to do X' but 'I want to do Y'. I.e. not 'I need to have a shower' but 'I want to feel clean and refreshed'. Not 'I need to clear this clutter' but 'I want to sit in a relaxing space'. 
What. How does he think European women get around? In the UK especially it is rare to see an automatic. 
"Objectively, any of the Chrises or Tom Hardy."
"I ran into a screen door. Like BAM, face bounces off and everything. I was sober, just not paying attention. He died laughing and eventually I did too. But still, absolutely MORTIFYING. We were still getting to know each other haha. "
"Peanut butter, chocolate, and coffee. "
"That's not how it worked for me. I wouldn't consider us ""dating"" unless we were exclusive. I didn't date casually or want to date anyone who was seeing other people."
"He does realize there are indeed female doctors and surgeons nowadays, right?"
"I keep trying to start a trend of calling all men who like sports ""basic."" It IS basic, it's about as basic bro as you can get. "
"I think you have a drinking problem. When we first started dating, I didn’t see anything wrong with you having a beer or two after work, but now I realize you have a dependency. 

You drink every day. You drink every time before we go out. You get drunk with your friends for fun. You get drunk with your family for fun. You get drunk alone for fun. I don’t like to drink to get drunk and I can’t really drink, so I end up feeling like I can’t have fun with you and that sucks.

I realize now you and your ex had an empty, codependent relationship because you were both drunk all the time and that was all that was keeping you together. 

You admitted your dad was an alcoholic and you were trying to get away from drinking, but you need to admit you have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I can’t do it for you and you need to do it now while you’re young and there’s still time. "
"Damn that's fancy. Does American cheese and hard salami with ritz crackers count as ""cheese board"". Lol I want to be fancy too. "
"My former roommate.  He assaulted me on the eve of Father’s Day many years ago, while driving me home.  I fought back and other motorists heard, but no one stopped.  He left me for dead in a ditch, after raping me, and nearly running me over.  I didn’t want to call my father because it was now early AM on Father’s Day, so I took the rape kit alone in the ER.  I had to learn how to do everything again.  Because he was the good-time fun-time hang-out guy and I was known for being wilder, people believed him.  One of my friends even tried to get me not to press charges and later hooked up with him.  I pressed charges but dropped them and fled the state after ten months of seeing him in the courthouse and countless times he violated the restraining order I had against him.  The idea of Justice was hollow.

What I’ve noticed in the many years since that time is that these guys, who aren’t really that great, often are believed over the females they prey on.  They know how to select those who may be viewed as faulty witnesses or who are too wounded to speak or fight back.  Always listen to the words said.  Always. "
"This is my most persistent complaint about het sex. Girl-on-girl is awesome because no one's using foreplay as a warm-up for dick, we're just giving and getting pleasure."
"My mom is Filipino and my dad is half African American, which resulted in me having realllly tight curls. I typically go to to any salon that has a brown or black lady working at it. Might sound fucked up but they understand the texture and thickness of my hair much more.

However, I once had a 70 year old French men who knew no English and he cut my hair to perfection. So who knows 🤷🏽‍♀️"
I have Crohn's disease so he has seen some shit. Literally. I shit myself driving my car and he helped me clean it. Never said a word other than concern for me. He is so much better than I deserve. 
"Oh my god I dated a guy in college that, while sweet, was totally clueless. His parents were high up in some bogus health MLM, rich as all get out,and didn’t believe in science.

We were hanging out one day when I felt my period start. I told him, and slowly started to get up to take care of it and he FREAKED OUT. Started pushing me in a panic to run to the bathroom. I was like ???!

He thought tampons acted like plugs, and if you didn’t plug your vajeen your period would all fall out at once. That was a painful conversation to have with a grown man. "
"Wrote a book at 27. Sold it at 28. By the time I hit 30, I was  a full-time novelist. (This after majoring in English and spending a decade working the usual English major jobs--waiting tables, tending bar, working retail.)"
"Farted her awake, we took a nap and I woke up sweating with a crazy case of swamp ass. I thought it would be quiet but it was LOUD, and long. It lasted roughly 45 seconds, long enough for her to wake up, realize what was happening, and get mad. "
That's awful. Maybe save it for special occasions to some party or somewhere the creeps won't see you! 
"Yup. She admitted to intentionally trying to groom her little sister, bribing her for physical affection, and iirc recounted masturbating next to her while sharing a bed. She also has a story about when her sister was a toddler she discovered that she'd been sticking pebbles up her vagina. Which, I mean, I guess it's good that they were discovered so they could be removed, but why the fuck was she digging around in her sister's vagina?

She told these stories as if this was normal quirky kid behavior, apparently totally unaware that most of us never did shit like splay open our toddler siblings' vaginas. A publication tried to call her put on her predatory behavior but it eventually blew over, probably because she's a woman tbh. If a guy talked about masturbating next to his sleeping younger sister I doubt anyone would brush it off.

Doesn't surprise me at all that she'd defend someone accused of rape, considering her own history."
"After getting a useless degree and working secretarial jobs with skills from high school,  I went back to school and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering at 28. Worked 25 years at one of the big automotive manufacturers and retired early at 54."
"Those are the same geniuses who go ""why should women be able to breastfeed in public when I can't whip my dick out with impunity???"" "
YES. OMG YES. That's actually why I started buying it several years back. It's amazing stuff. Also great for shoes that give you blisters.
"I worked in many tech jobs (Including support, gaming and sales) and ugh I got that shit all the time. Though when I working in retail I couldn't help but smile with glee when a customer would ignore me asking if they needed help and go to a male coworker only for him to explain (Without him knowing that the customer had blown me off) that I was in fact the best person to talk to about buying whatever they needed (computers, games, peripheral  etc). The looks on their faces when my co workers would gesture to me was always solid gold. "
Abstinence-only education works.
"He passed,we were married for 30 years. "
"I would also add that it doesn't make up for making the lives of those who told the truth (victims and allies) harder by denying it and publicly criticizing those who ""spread rumours"" as recently as 2 months ago."
"Bad sex. We were just fundamentally sexually incompatible. Stuck around for a few years because we were otherwise so compatible and I️ was convinced we could overcome the sex stuff with enough communication and compromise. Eventually I realized that issues in the bedroom will end up sort of festering and leaking into the good parts of the relationship. It started wearing on me to the point where I️ almost resented him, which wasn’t fair to either of us. Leaving was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made, but also one of the best. "
"How loudly I speak.  
I lectured for years in large rooms with no PA systems so I learned how to project *really well.* "
Microwave. We don't have much counter space and the oven does just as well!
Oh god this makes me laugh so hard. 
"Nope, why would I want to sleep with someone I'm angry with?"
"Rando guy touching your back made me cringe hard. So, so gross. "
"How does this work? Do you all just trust them to be honest about the results? 

Open a letter together so you know it's real? 

do I just have trust issues 

help me out lmao"
Clothes they feel stylish in. I know options are more limited for menswear but I love seeing guys look confident in something outside the button down shirt box.
"Ugh. I have a second uncle who had an ongoing sexual relationship with his own daughter since she was 12. When he finally died, she came forward with the information because she assumed it was better than to cause a whole legal situation when he still was alive. It didn't help her at all because he entire family just told her she was a liar and now she doesn't come to any family functions anymore. I wish I had a way to tell her we're not all against her."
"Weirdest example I can think of is when we got the original ipod classics for Christmas the year that they debuted. My apple product-loving uncle and I had sent us two ipods in the same package addressed to both of us, one was black and one was white. I wanted the black one, and since they hadn't been packaged separately it was basically our choice of which color we want. Anyways, my parents made me give my brother the black one and I had to take the white one, because ""black is a boy color"". I'm still a little salty about it."
My husband told me he loved me after our second date. I told him after the second month. We were married for a long time. 
"Pistachio, dark chocolate, coconut - and I’d change it to gelato! "
"Tangle teaser - I used to spend loads of money on detangling sprays and now I don't have to. I don't know if if works on all hair types, but between me with straight fine hair and my friend with thick wavy hair it's a life changer!"
"&gt; I guess it's because something like looks relate closely to genetics and it's seen as not being ""fair""?

that, and the vaguely narcissistic fantasy of being the One Guy who helps her understand that she's beautiful. but not too much because part of the fantasy is that she won't believe she's beautiful to anyone but him."
Why do men always compare our nipples to their dicks? Do they not realize that they also have nipples? 
Note to self: change sheets more often
"I am no fan of Lena Dunham but I think this narrative is ridiculous. She was *seven years old* in the vagina-pebbles story. Read what specialists in child development say about children exploring each others' bodies. To label a seven-year-old a sexual predator is absurd.

This often gets mashed up with the masturbation story, which was when she was a teenager. Her sister often asked to sleep in her bed; she sometimes surreptitiously masturbated regardless of her presence. Judge that on its own terms, but are you really going to say that this is comparable to sexual abuse?

Seriously, I think that her writing is self-indulgent and uninteresting, but the way that people try to mash together stories and obscure the ages they happened in order to suggest something sinister always seems so dishonest."
"I've retired all graphic tees from my wardrobe. I'm 28 but look 15, and wearing tee shirts with cartoon characters on them wasn't doing me any favors.

I can report, however, that men who are going to be gross to you for wearing a band/video game shirt give no shits about being gross to (what they think is) a teenage girl."
"Hell no. If I am pissed, he's not fucking touching me. I don't even want him breathing in my direction. How the hell does that even work."
I became a tattoo artist. I started my apprenticeship at 28. I've been at it for ten years now and opened my own studio in January. 
"I'll chime in since I seem to be reading his statement differently than some others in this thread. I'll agree that he didn't explicitly say ""I'm sorry"" but if I recall correctly he's contacted his victims individually to apologise? (If this isn't true please correct me). I'm overall satisfied with the statement; he doesn't make excuses or deny anything, and it's not all bullshit buzzwords about how bad he feels. He acknowledged the power difference between himself and the women, and I think it's a really great thing that he sees that. So, so many men refuse to believe they are privileged.

It seems to me that he seems genuinely remorseful. I'd be interested in seeing him speak about this in an interview. Hopefully his victims have gotten some closure from this whole situation."
Yes. That wasn’t my first time going down on a guy either. A made at different guy cum in minutes. I was so proud of myself!
I️ always thought women liked it when I️ tried to rip their spine out of their body through their clitoris and scream FATALITY.  Is this not pleasurable?
"If you can't handle me at my gassiest, then you don't deserve me at my classiest."
I’d love to see the lord of the rings movies back in theatres. I reckon the grandeur is the best place to see them.
"I dated a man for 18 months. In many ways we were soulmates (if I can use that term to mean something other than just the one person who exists for you). We communicated better emotionally and had better sex than I had previously known was possible. We could work through almost any issue and the 18 months we were together were particularly turbulent, so we flexed this muscled a lot. 

Unfortunately, he put his job and his hobby ahead of me. I was always scheduled around those two things. He frequently stayed out until 2 am to play pool (his hobby). He missed a charitable event that I threw (which I worked hard on for four months) to go watch a pool tournament. He skipped my grandma's funeral to work (didn't really *have* to work, just wanted to get the job done). He didn't take the time to get to know my friends, using work as an excuse as to why he never could. His whole life was shaped around work and pool. I was third. 

Eventually, I realized that I deserved better. I was making my world revolve around him and he wasn't doing the same for me. 18 months in and he hadn't even met a number of my friends. He was constantly making excuses for why he couldn't make his life mesh more with mine. 

I just couldn't do it anymore. His idea of a relationship was having someone at home that was missing him. My idea of a relationship was being together, supporting each other (including events and funerals), having common friends and hobbies. 

So I left. I immediately regretted it. We went back and forth for a while. It got dramatic. Sometimes I still regret it. We still talk, which makes things difficult. He's a good man, but not the man for me. I keep the faith that someone out there will want to put me first. To me, that's love. "
Also god forbid we want to look beautiful independently of men seeing it. Why can nobody believe that i genuinely like to look good just for myself. Why is that notion dismissed and why is it forced on me that I am only trying for male attention? 
"Not a close friend. And I will carry the shame and lesson from the first girl he abused forever.

He's almost 50, poly, married (divorced now) and was dating a girl in her 20s when I met them both. 

They broke up and it was messy. What I saw was a young woman breaking apart and ""over""reacting to everything, and a suave fella who simply wanted to be left alone by this CrAzY lady. 

I laughed about it with him. 

And then, and then. It happened *again*. Same age gap, same type of girl-- one with a history of mental health issues. She seemed like the crazy one, he seemed like he was a simple victim with unfortunate taste in partners.

Except now I knew better. Now I knew that everything he was putting forward was a manipulative facade. 

Now I believe victims first. *Always*.

I cut him off and will continue to warn anyone I know who knows him what an abusive terrible monster he is. "
"""Why do you need special items? Why not just put a paper towel in your underwear? It'd be much more efficient.""

I asked why he bought pants when he could just wrap a sheet around his waist, since it'd be more efficient."
That sex ends when the man comes.
"Oh. My. God. 

I went to get an oil change the other day and the guys were like ""oh I didn't know this make/model/year came in automatic! We usually see stick!""

Um. What the fuck? Did you even look? Ask? No. You just assumed that I'm some dumb delicate ladyfolk who can't work two feet at and hands at the same time. Eat shit. It's a standard and I'm damn proud of it. "
"Let me tell you that the whole insistent pushing of 'wash your hair every three days or only wash once a week otherwise your hair will fall out and everyone will hate you' crap needs to stop.

There is nothing wrong with washing your hair everyday if that's what you need. 

Some people can use dry shampoo to go longer, some can't.

Some people are just naturally oily and would like it removed.

I've met people doing the whole 'I'm only washing my hair once a week with apple cider vinegar and my natural body oils will recover and I'll be so amazingly beautiful and low maintenance'.

And I've met a few people that that's worked for.

I've also met several that it was *not* working for, like 'written up at work because they look so gross, seriously Samantha it's been four months this natural stuff isn't cutting it' not working for them.

Sorry this turned into a rant. You should do what makes you feel best and in ten years society and beauty trends will probably say the opposite of whatever it's saying now."
You're amazing. Never forget it.
"When I was 19, my half brother who is 8 years older than me asked me if I could tell the baby from the rest of the blood when I menstruate or if it's all just one big bloody mess. I just said what a couple of times."
"Once drunkenly told my husband he didn't dance very well. 

13 years of him refusing to dance with me since has made me regret that more than anything. 

To clarify: he doesn't like to dance, was only dancing with me to impress me and likes the excuse."
I once came across someone asking if menstrual cups worked like plungers so you could plunge blood out and give yourself a shorter period. I wish I had a screen shot of that. 
"Shopping for fun. Honestly, I find great satisfaction in building an outfit I like that looks good on me. It boosts my self esteem as long as I don't over spend, and I briefly see the physical manifestation of my hard work as I'm using money I've saved and worked for. "
He's my vote as well. I saw an interview he did shortly after he announced his marriage to Lisa Bonet and he was giddy like a little kid over her. It was so sweet to see a big manly dude get so googly eyed over his woman. 
"Take 45 pound plates off a barbell. Once had a man come over and start taking them off my barbell for me and I had to put them back on because I was doing the same weight he was. It’s one thing to ask a woman if she needs help with something in the gym, but most times they’ll ask someone if they need help. Don’t assume!!! "
We need more sex positions. Do me on the kitchen counter again. Let’s do it in a place where we can caught. IDC just make it crazy.
"Learning to be 100% self-fulfilling. As I get older (27 now) I'm accepting that whoever I date isn't going to meet my emotional, mental, or sexual needs, and I need to do that myself in order to be happy. Definitely very different from how I viewed relationships when I was younger. "
"And then they try to wrestle it away, right?"
I interrupt people way too frequently. I know it's impolite but I just get excited and blurt. I'm trying to improve it but it's difficult. 
"And it's not like you can always keep it separate. If you live together, the rent/mortgage needs to be paid no matter what, so you wind up covering them when they inevitably can't pull their weight. I don't have the money to support grown ass men, nor the energy to beg and plead with them to get their shit together anymore."
"i wouldn't date someone who was dating other people...just not for me. i'm very clear about this, i don't assume anything. and it can be casual. maybe we only go on two dates. but for that time period, it's exclusive. "
"Screw that! Around here, women wear sports bras when riding bikes in the summer.

Don't let some jerkwad make you feel like you're not allowed to have cleavage. And ride that bike! I bet there's way more people who passed you thinking ""I admire this woman for being physically active"" instead of ""nice tits"" ."
"yeah. remember that super messed up ask a rapist thread on askreddit a while back?

all those guys literally raped people and from their perspective they did nothing wrong"
He stands in front of his bowl and cries like he's a starving orphan child whom nobody loves.
That reminds me of something i read awhile ago. This guy thought he was better at his job than his female coworker because he got stuff done faster. One day he had to use her email to contact a client and he got a lot of pushback. He and his coworker decided to swap email adresses for a week as an experiment. End result was she ended up getting stuff done faster and he kept getting pushback and runaround from clients because of the female name attached to the email.
"This happened to me at Walmart. I was holding a 32 pack of water and an associate YELLED at me to put it down. I said “I’m all set thanks” and he yelled again, came over and grabbed it from me and put it into my cart. He said “I didn’t want you to hurt yourself” I was so pissed! If I tell you I’m all set and I don’t need help, then just leave me the hell alone ugh "
Yep. One of my closest friends in college raped a girl who lived on our floor. I stopped being friends with him after that.
"Americans approach romantic relationships in the 21st century like shopping for a car. You take several models for test runs, you evaluate features and benefits, then you “buy” the one that’s the best fit. Or maybe not - maybe you “lease” it to keep one foot out the door in case a better model comes along.

In case it’s not apparent that I think this is a shitty way to go about it, I think it’s a shitty way to go about it."

"Dressing is definitely different. If you're concerned about what your friends will think of your s/o's weight/skin/nose/whatever, I think that's shitty. But being concerned over the way they present themselves is completely reasonable. "
I too have an Isis shirt. Except it's for a band. Now I can't imagine how they can continue to sell shirts with their name. They've been around for decades too.
I really wish you realized how important is is to me that you do very very simple things I’ve been constantly nagging you about for years- such as pick up your wet towels. You leave them all over our room and they stink and they make the bed wet and it’s awful and uncomfortable and you act like it’s no big deal but it’s been slowly driving my insane and it makes me feel like you don’t value me. There’s a lot of problems in our relationship that stem from you being unable or unwilling to listen but this right here would be the greatest start to fixing that gap in communication between us.
"Back in high school when my gay friend asked this girl out to Sadie’s. It was all hyped up, everyone was excited. He had balloons, decorations in the theatre room. We were all waiting for her to come. 

She eventually came and said no to him. She said “we all know you’re gay, and I only wanna go with a date, not a friend.” He left the room crying, and came out maybe 1-2 days later everyone. "
"in middle school I had this u-neck purple shirt with elbow-length sleeves that I LOVED cause purple was my favorite color. in my 8th grade science class a boy in my project group was staring at my boobs (which were completely covered!) the entire class and at one point he told me I ""looked like a wh*re"" in that top. I never wore it again but I couldn't bear to get rid of it because I loved that shirt so much :("
"Right? I had an ex boyfriend say ""if you can show off cleavage, I should be able to show off the top of my dick"". He looked surprised when I pointed out that not only can he show off the tops of his pecs too, he can show off his ENTIRE CHEST. It genuinely didn't occur to him that the closest equivalent of female nipples was male nipples. I will never understand that logic. "
"That no woman (or no person, for that matter) cares that I am in a wheelchair.  My concern for people's view of my disability arises from my own feelings of inadequacy and shortcoming.

It took me years to understand that everyone has things they have wrong with them, things they aren't good at, things that are difficult for them.  And that's ok.

Sometimes, its not about fixing said problems but accepting them, learning from them, and then moving through them despite the circumstances.  

My life continues to constantly try to stare me down. But now that I am learning to understand myself, I am able to stare back."
Every weekend. 
Think it would work in the summer on thighs?
"Donate blood.
This chap was convinced that they don't let women donate when it's cold (it was still 10'C, not that cold). I asked him to explain why, and he got all flustered pretty quickly when I pointed out a bloke, smaller in stature than me, entering the donation centre. "
"And at least in this newest statement he admits he tried to run away from the allegations - I assume he means by ignoring and then most recently claiming they were just rumors. 

This one just fucking sucks. I loved Louis CK - he's always been far from perfect but the message of his work has always resounded really well with me.

"My thoughts on rape apologists:

- I think it is a misguided attempt to try to remind humanity that every person is multi-faceted and not just any one thing or one action they have performed in their past or present.

- I think it comes from the psychological need not to have been conned. It isn't about the alleged predator, it isn't about the complaining victim, it is about the defender wanting to appear infallible in their choice of friends and not realizing that as a human being, sometimes they are off the mark and that is okay.

- I think it comes from self-awareness that the defender has engaged in the same action and so figures they can prevent their own consequences if they prevent any consequences to anyone for that same action.

- I think it comes from fear that the defender may not remember engaging in the same action, but considerers it likely that they may have, and so figures they can prevent their own consequences if they prevent any consequences to anyone for that same action."
"Same here.  This whole ""exclusivity conversation"" thing is so bizarre to me."
How is this not a thing yet?
"I'm not really feminine at all. My family is pretty hardcore about traditional gender roles and stuff. My mom lost it when I told her I didn't like dresses and skirts as a tween.

I occasionally want to be fancy and look like a lady, but most of the time I'm into androgyny and I'm not interested in talking about weddings and babies.

I don't mean this like ""Oooh, I'm not like other girls~"" or something. I like other girls just fine. I'm not sure that any woman in the world is actually *exclusively* into the kind of stuff Gender Role Essentialists label as ""feminine"". 

But for a while I tried hard to at least look the part - started wearing dresses a lot, grew out my hair, bought a bunch of shoes, worked with kids, a lot of the stuff my family wanted me to do. 

And then I went to therapy and realized I don't remotely want that. "
"It’s important to note that Louis has been denying these accusations for years, gaslighting and dismissing women who came forward. This apology is only happening because the NYT did an expose on the accusations. This is not a real apology; it’s an attempt at damage control, his way of mitigating the fallout from his behavior now that people are actually taking sexual harassment &amp; assault seriously. "
"A close friend of mine works in comics, and that industry has only barely begun to scratch the surface of shit.

There's a reason why you see a lot more female and LGBT creators at the independent press events than the big companies, and its not because they're not good enough to ""cut it"", its because they flee a predatory industry. Same with animation."
"What?? Browse anything that has to do with this topic online. You cannot have a racial preference, height preference, weight preference. If you ask your partner to cut their hair or shave their beard then you’re controlling them and “don’t love them for who they are.” Same goes for clothes and makeup and almost everything. "
"My boyfriend and I were good friends/friends with benefits before we started dating. There was a point where we started to wonder if we could be something else so we decided to pause the hookups and go on a proper date. 

The day of the date, we were hanging out like friends and we were walking somewhere. We were walking up some steps and it just so happened that our hands brushed against each other. 

I interpreted this as him trying to hold  my hand, so I went to hold his, super excited because by that point I realized I did have romantic feelings for him. He looks at my hand, then at me, and loudly asks ""are you trying to hold my hand?"" 

I got so embarrassed and scurried like 3 feet away from him. To this day, this story is his go-to to make me blush. "
"Nope. If I'm angry with him I usually don't want to be in the same room, let alone have sex. "
"I'm not even sure what goes through their heads when they do such things - like, do these dudes really think we need them to carry it and are trying to be helpful? Or are they just conditioned by society so much on ""fragile ladies"" that they don't think at all and just do it automatically?

The third option is that they are being creeps :D

Usually, if they succeed in removing the plates from my hands, they linger around and try to make small talk. I now understand why women-only gyms exist."
"The thing that makes him more right for me than anyone else I've ever met is that he is unbelievably easygoing and patient. I'm a huge ball of stress and anxiety so it's calming to be around someone who is so level-headed and just..chill. And he has the patience to deal with how high strung I get sometimes and puts in effort to calm me down and does so many little things to elevate my mood when I'm not feeling well. 

This is a double edged sword though. He's so easy going that he procrastinates everything - from taking the trash out, to returning things to the store, to getting a haircut, to planning vacations, to arranging pet sitting, etc etc. Sometimes these things aren't a big deal - trash can be taken out tomorrow, nbd. But sometimes we aren't able to take certain vacations or do certain activities because if I don't plan it, he'll wait til it's too expensive or an event is all sold out, or we don't have the supplies to do something... he hates that I nag him to do stuff but if I don't hammer out details then it won't get done in time. It's super annoying but I think it's worth picking up the slack in exchange for what I wrote in the first paragraph. We just perform emotional labor in different ways. In a way, it might also be good anyway that I take care of a lot of the details because I'm much more anal about how I want things done "
"I took a shower, wrapped myself in a towel, and went to talk to my then boyfriend in the bedroom. I don't remember what set me off, but something stupid made me grumpy, so I tried to leave the bedroom in a huff. Unfortunately for me, my toe got caught in a cat toy that was hanging from the door. One second I'm angry and the next I'm confused, flying through the air as my towel parts ways with me. I land butt naked on the floor and had to endure the sound of him going into hysterics. As embarrassing as it was, it was hilarious. It broke my bad mood pretty fast. "
"Honestly, if it gets to the point where I want to be exclusive and he doesn't then I just walk. I am an open, passionate, person and I don't have time to wait around and see if someone wants to date me. If someone goes on a few dates with me and doesn't realize how awesome I am, that's their loss."
The same way I feel about unrealistic body standards for women. No one should have to deal with that. 
"I mean, I think farts are funny. But I also think they're pretty unattractive. So, the occasional fart is okay, sometimes farts happen, but continuing to fart constantly and openly in front of your partner is a no-no to me."
"I've seen a lot of ""what louis ck did wasn't that bad. He didn't touch them, they were free to walk away."" They really don't understand the role that power dynamics and fear factor in. "
"A lot. I’m one of those seemingly social and outgoing people, but I like doing it on my terms. If I’m feeling forced into a social setting when I’m not up for it, I feel like I’m dying inside"

that i use humour/a happy shell to avoid intimacy and vulnerability. ouuuuch it's true though. idk what to do about it.
"My lifelong best friend, I cut him off because he would make comments like “you’re so humble, my sunglasses cost more than you’re entire outfit” or “you wanna get a midnight snack at this diner?” But he only invited me out to eat when it was dark out because he didn’t want to be seen with me out in public where he might run in to someone he knows. He would ditch me in the middle of a movie if a chick called him. He had really dramatic, rich, snobby friends and Im the complete opposite. (Think of those kids in college where they say “my dad is a lawyer!” Chino shorts, sperrys, douche tanks) I always wanted to think he was just that lame kid who secretly wanted to be in the in crowd but wasn’t. really he was just an asshole. Took me 19 years to figure that out. And my other ex best friend, I had since day one of high school. We were platonic, strictly. He was the kid that got stuffed in lockers, I was the really shy girl who secretly did drugs and when everyone found out it was like “it’s the quiet ones!” He struggled with getting gfs and I always tried to tell him stop looking, she will come when the time is right, half way through college he meets her and she’s threatened by me. At first I had no idea because I was trying to plan things alone with her like movie nights, I’d text her all the time, and try to just do girl friend type stuff and she acted like it was all cool. But one day she told him she’s threatened and doesn’t want him around me anymore. So that was the last time I spoke to him. "
"It makes sense if it's a lifestyle thing, but ime, there are a *lot* of folks out there who want a partner that's physically fit *without* doing anything to make themselves that way.  Guys especially seem to have this fantasy woman in their heads that's hot and thin, but still packs away food and ""chills"" on the weekends instead of going to the gym.  Also she doesn't worry about makeup or clothes or grooming because *that's* shallow, but she's still naturally beautiful and hairless and stylish, but in a careless kind of way.  Blegh. "
"My weight loss. 


My husband finally caved and told me I couldn't be wearing pants that were 3 sizes too large anymore and that it was making people uncomfortable "
"From my 12 year old son (not ridiculous because how would he have known, but I found it too funny to not share)

Me - I won't be needing these for awhile! (Cleaning tampons out of purse)

Him - You mean you don't get your period when you're pregnant?

Me - No, dude. That's like the one perk. 

Him - (looks uncomfortable) Well, it's just that you're acting like you do when you're on your period...

Me - proceeds to laugh, apologize, and then cry a bit. Thank you, pregnancy. "
"A guinea pig I had once was “trained” to duck and hide, when I brought them veggies.

The first “training session” was me accidentally dropping the food bowl on her head. (It clearly hurt, but she was ok.) 

The second was the very next feeding, where the other pig whacked her over the head with a piece of carrot she was taking from my hand.

After that, she’s come rushing over, remember the pain and hide, then stick out her head anxiously for food.

I felt *really* bad about it."
"Snow White’s prince kissed a corpse. No matter how big a douchebag the other guys were, this one skeeves me out the most."

"I went to a white hair salon after hearing high praise from a friend repeatedly. It felt odd as soon as a I walked in. My hairdresser wasnt expecting my hair to be as coarse or as thick as it was, and had expected to wash and straighten it within an hour. So when she obviously couldnt finish it in that time, she had another hairstylst work on it while she took on her 3o clock client, then when that stylist got her client, they switched me to another stylist. I felt like i was traded around like I was some task no one could take on. Granted it was just some bad communication my friend had made with the stylist, but it didnt stop me from feeling like i was being passed around like an animal in a big salon while everyone watches."

"Amazon Basics wipes. Cheap and last forever. I go through wet wipes like no ones business, but these last and last. $11 for a HUGE box. 

It's Prime only, but a huge deal. These vs regular wipes is like $300 a year savings. The wipes alone more than pay for Prime membership and a year of themselves AND leaves me with $100.

Sure, they aren't great wipes....but they are moist...and they wipe. "
"Yep. Took several months after he raped me to admit it was rape and I didn't need to gaslight myself nor should I continue seeking validation from him or allow him to manipulate me. My former best female friend went on to be friends with him after I told her, though. "
"My cat doesn't respond to normal words for food or dinner time. She responds to ""feed the cats"" because that's what my mom would always tell me when I was still living with my parents (my cat is fuckin old)

And my sister's dog now goes ballistic any time somebody makes the ""pssst"" noise we use to get the cats to stop doing bad stuff, because he personally assigned himself the position of Cat Police"
"Yeah, when you're 20 and in college, I think it's pretty normal to say things like ""money doesn't matter--only love!"" because you are students, many of you are under your parents' healthcare, you aren't established in your careers, etc.  When you start to get older, having a partner who doesn't have healthcare, can't afford to even go to the movies or to a cheap dinner, absolutely can't take time off for a vacation once a year, is deeply in debt from previous poor financial mistakes, and can't keep a steady, decent paying job...that's not a ""little"" thing at all."
"Lol. I yelled,

"I think they were cheating. In my opinion, flirting with someone is cheating and it was very obvious they had feelings for one another. Roy was a real jerk, but Pam should have ended things if she wasn't happy and in love with someone else."
"I find that most people who ""hate small talk"" are pretty terrible at holding conversations when you do try to go deeper and really fail at social interaction in general. 

Like, I'm not a huge fan of small talk and I don't think I've met anyone who loves it, but most decently adjusted people recognize that it's an important part of social interaction and a building block to more meaningful relationships with others. "
"Flannel shirts, layered, rolled up. They go in and out of style and I love them on guys through it all. "

It took me eight months to say it. It took him another for months after that to say it back. "
"I don't love high waisted pants, but I will say this: they're *WORLDS* better than that garbage that is low rise. 

I get irrationally angry at the thought of low rise for a few reasons:

* They shorten legs like crazy, even on very long-legged women. They make women look stumpy.
* They make everyone who wears them (even extremely thin women with a very low body fat %) look like they have a massive gut and muffin top.
* You have to make 100% sure you shave your pubic hair to perfection, because these pants are guaranteed to cause your mons pubis to show.
* If you don't want your mons pubis to show, then you have to hike them up in the front, thus revealing your asscrack. Asscrack hanging out reminds me of fat plumbers, again, even on the most thin women out there. Very ugly, imo. 
* ""Whale tail"" thong sticking out...*barfs*
* They're *cold*. In order to not catch a cold breeze on the very sensitive area that is your lower abdomen/upper pelvic region, you'd basically have to wear long tunics with them. You can only wear so many tunics before you get sick of them.

The thought of super low rise jeans coming back into style legitimately brings me anxiety. "
"I was born in 1960.  My folks let me do what I wanted.  I was a combo tom boy, pensive child living in my imagination and a girl's girl.  I climbed trees, played raucous games of capture the flag with a bunch of neighbor kids, both boy and girl, acted in school skits, loved science and nature, cooked my heart out, took dance lessons and riding lessons.  My parents taught me and my brother and sister how to change the oil in the car, change a flat, bake bread, dance, fix a broken tap, light a pilot light, change a baby's diaper, drive a stick shift, and so on.  Not once did we hear we should not do something or aspire to something as it was a girl thing or a boy thing.  

The only memory I have of them treating me and my sis differently was them being more careful with us.  Closer tabs were kept on us than our brother.  I understand this completely now.  Family friends of ours lost their 16 year old daughter to someone who kidnapped her.  She was taken four blocks from our house, and her body was found a few miles away.  She had been tortured, raped and strangled.  So, I get my folk's fears.  Other than that, they were remarkably open minded, especially for the times were were living in."

"Actually texted him just now to ask him what my most embarrassing moment. We both thought of the same one:

I was roleplaying with him during sex. Got a liiiittle too into it. Went to slap his cheek, missed, slapped him right across the ear. We had to stop, as his ear started ringing and wouldn’t stop for a solid hour :/ "

For the past 3 years, the  dog alerts me that it is after 9 p.m. If I refuse to move she barks, pulls my clothing, huffs, etc.   She nudges me down the hallway and waits outside the bedroom door.   Our daughter isn't  as amused by this as we (her parents) are. "
Awh! Tried to be thoughtful and ended up a little ignorant. I love this one. 
"I’ve completely confident that this sub is against the norm. While it should be this prevalent, the reality is that it’s not. At least among college-aged people.

Fucking of course. Just go and yank it right out of my hands. Rude.
"lol this whole mentality has always confused the hell out of me. first, the guys who like to hate on people wearing makeup because ""i bet she looks different without makeup."" like, okay, let's say i'm wearing an amazing dress. does one of these guys come up to me and say ""hey, if you were wearing a burlap sack, you would probably look different""? and then it's like, ok, sure, but i'm wearing this dress so like...calm down.

and then there's the guys who think that they're being super tricked by women who have somehow transformed themselves from horrifyingly deformed bog monsters into gorgeous supermodel princesses with a few dabs of concealer. i mean, the main concern here, i assume, is that this woman might sometimes look like a horrifyingly deformed bog monster, right? but guys! you have nothing to worry about! if makeup could transform a woman from a -50 to a perfect 5/7, i'm pretty sure that woman would never not be wearing it.

"I have one of these too! I wore it for a school presentation and instantly felt the multitude of stares it got and haven't worn it since in three years. I should donate it, but it's so sexy and I want there to be a day I can wear it without feeling self-conscious."

"I JUST finished reading an article about this. Apparently they said: ""....We believe, having worked closely with him for more than half a decade, that this is the case with Murray Miller. While our first instinct is to listen to every woman’s story, our insider knowledge of Murray’s situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3 percent of assault cases that are misreported every year.”

This ""insider knowledge of Murray's situation"" that makes them confident he's innocent, these are guesses...

He's gay: Doesn't explain it. We all heard stories of people identified as heterosexual harassing someone from the same sex and vice versa. Not a guarantee the accusation is false.

He's always been this wonderful person around them:  We all heard stories of people who were generally very nice has been utterly shitty in a criminal way to some other people, or just one person. Not a guarantee the accusation is false.

She's unreliable: She was 17 at the time! But let's say she's unrealiable now, they know it, so they think this didn't happen back when she was 17. We all heard stories of rapists specifically targeting ""unrealiable"" people in hopes of other people not believing their word. Again, not a guarantee the accusation is false.

My conclusion: There is no way to be sure an accusation is false. Nobody spends all of their time with someone. I think everyone should remember commenting is optional and if they have doubts, maybe they should use the option of not making a comment. If they have evidence the person is innocent, they should show that evidence or at least explain what exactly makes them confident her accusation is not true."

I have gotten tests for myself while at annual obgyn appts with no prompting and am totally clean.

Not that there is anything wrong with asking! If it is what makes you most comfortable then go for it :) Most major health orgs have online portals for test results and if I were going to ask to see results I would have them pull the website up. "
"It's total shit. He was quoted not long ago saying it was all rumor. Now that his back is against the wall suddenly he is soooo sorry and he's soooo aware of all of the damage his actions have caused on other people and he's remorseful.

"&gt;Runner up: When I worked at Walmart and was the only licensed forklift driver in the store. Customer needed a pallet of bricks loaded on to his trailer. I said give me a few minutes, and went to find a spotter. He thought I went to get a man to drive the forklift, and freaked out saying ""Shes a girl! She can't drive a forklift! She'll wreck my trailer!"" 

I worked at a Sam's Club for ten years, it's more or less expected that 20-40% of the club can drive a lift, or at least it was at mine. Lots of woman drivers. And yet, what used to piss me off so much, is the *woman drivers themselves thinking that women can't drive a lift*, like, what the hell. I guess I shouldn't say anything, being a man, but operating a forklift does not require much strength. I will admit that it helps to be taller than 5'4, so men, being slightly taller on average, do have an advantage there, but forklift driving is so damn nongendered it boggles my mind.

But to hear a woman saying it.. As she's driving.. And doing a good job of it, at that! It's enough to make your ears pop."

And not little things, recently he was sitting and eating on the couch. No big deal, they're my leather couches and right now I don't have kitchen chairs so we eat in the living room. She yelled at him that he has to sit on the floor. I corrected her but she told me I'm a bad mom to let him eat on the couch. Everything I do is wrong.

She's also a know it all. She recently lost her virginity. Immediately became a sex expert. Tried to get me to tell her my sex issues so she could solve them.

Anyways... I barely see her."

Lmao if your Natural they really have no clue what they are doing. I️ only go to the salon to get my hair trimmed and I straighten my hair before hand so they don’t have to worry about it. But I️ guess white people wet their hair before cutting it. And the lady was about to spray my hair with water and I️ had to stop her and explain that if she does that she’s gonna get an Afro soooo it’s a no from me
Exactly what that One Direction song was about. I always thought it was creepy because how is your beauty dependent on you not knowing about it? What a shitty thing to sell low self-esteem to little girls.

"When I was in high school, my gym teachers told me that if I lifted weights that were too heavy, my uterus could fall out.  They also told me that if you got muscles and then stopped working them out, they'd turn to fat, so you'd be fatter than you were when you started.  And when I tried to ignore their advice and lift weights anyway, they'd say ""You can't use the weights without a spotter"" and then no one would spot me.

I've been taking an interest in lifting weights since I first set foot in a weight room at 13 or 14.  Even at 16, when I got a gym membership outside of school so I could use the weight room, the personal trainers would say ""You should be doing more cardio if you want to lose weight.  Lifting weights will just make you fatter.""

And it's not even like I'm an old lady here.  My gym teacher was telling me my uterus would fall out from lifting weights in *2002*.

Crossfit has really taken off in the past few years, but I spent just, like, a decade the only chick in the weight room, and even then, just to get to be *allowed* to be in the weight room, I had to first get through years of people literally preventing me from going there.

There's a guy I lift with who is one of the best in the world at bench pressing.  And he's been doing it since he was 12.  I know so many dudes who were fat kids who found weights and got strong. 
 When I started competing, all the best women were in their 40's and 50's.  And the number of years I am behind in sports, I can understand how that is.  If people let me lift weights when I started wanting to lift weights, I wouldn't have hated physical activity until my 20's."
YES. THIS. Their embarrassment sustains me. I feed on it. It's delicious. 
"He acknowledges that these stories are true and that he caused significant harm, right up front.

You can walk away from that statement feeling that Louis CK is a horrible person, but anyone that claims that isn't an apology is being petty.  Frankly I think saying ""I'm sorry"" is a lot less substantial than what is written here."
"It really bothers me how it seems unacceptable to say that you did something to improve your appearance. I see this a lot when it comes to weight loss/exercise; obviously health is a great motivator but these days it seems taboo for someone to admit that vanity played any part in their choices. 

Like, I truly enjoy exercising but I don't think that it is shallow of me to admit that I also work out because I like the way that it makes my body look. "
"Don't you know? Vaginas are made of memory foam - fucking the same dude 50 times will mold the walls to his dick, but fucking 50 different dudes that are all the same size will...confuse...the memory foam vagina...until it gives up and just collapses into a sad, saggy mess. I guess. That seems to be the logic among people who actually believe this schlock."

Paris Hilton. The woman has a multi-billion dollar empire and is still thought of as vacuous and shallow. Google recent interviews where she’s dropped the baby voice and you’ll see that she’s surprisingly articulate and switched on.
"Something similar happened to me at a store recently! I had an old guy get out of his scooter and try to yank the decorative tray with some other stuff on it that I was holding while I was in line because he wanted to set it on the counter for me (ahead of two other people...). I told him no thank you like five times before I was finally like “STOP I SAID IM FINE” and he called me an ungrateful bitch and got back in his scooter. Lol

If you’re “doing something for someone else” and when they ask you not to do it you keep at it, you’re not doing it for **them**."
"I like my bras! I don't like my boobs swinging around when I walk, and once I figured out my size properly, they only increased my comfort."
Keanu Reeves. I've had a crush on him since Speed and I've given up on ever shaking off that crush.
Sounds like a lesser-known Jedi.
"Unless I'm explicitly looking for casual sex, I don't have sex with somebody I'm not exclusive with.  If I like somebody, I'll say ""I really like you, I think we should try a relationship.""  And if they're like ""I don't know if I'm ready to be exclusive,"" I'll be like ""That's totally cool and I understand, no pressure.  But that's what I'm looking for, so ball's in your court.  If you are ready, I want you to tell me, and in the meantime if I meet somebody else that *is* ready, so be it.""

And I legit do.  I've never had a person tell me they weren't ready for a relationship come around with more time.  That's a way for a person to say ""I don't want an exclusive relationship, please fuck me anyway,"" without feeling like a shithead.  I just take it as a signal that I'm barking up the wrong tree and I start meeting other people.

When you meet somebody who feels about you the way you feel about them, they aren't going to want to wait to be sure.  They're going to want to be with you."
"Once I was getting an oil change and they were doing the whole thing where they tell you if you don't get their new part, your car will self destruct, and they were laying it on thick (I was probably about 18 and drove a very quirky car, so I'm sure they thought I'd be easy to scare out of my money). They were telling me how my car was desperately overdue for new automatic transmission fluid, and how it was vitally important that it get done that day or I risked serious engine damage. 

I put on my best ""dumb girl"" voice and said, ""Oh wow, an automatic transmission?! I didn't even know my car had one of those!"" and wiggled my (manual) shifter side to side a few times. They stopped trying to sell me shit after that. "
That lady. I can't words because that lady. Stabbing is true. 
Right? Baby wipes ain't a thing here and to me they're also incredibly wasteful.
"My tattoos &amp; piercings - My parents absolutely hate them, but I think they're beautiful!"
They won a million dollars on a slot machine and had to stay married for six months in order to collect it because Dennis Miller is insane. They ended up falling in love and staying together.
Tfw you  live in a place where winters are 20°C

Goddamn"
Jesse Williams.
Well I just got a new fear. 
"So, at one point years ago, I realized my cat did this bizarre thing. Every time I come home, she runs to the closest mat — either the mat by the front door, or a bathroom mat — and starts rolling around on the ground, shrieking. 

It’s honestly the weirdest thing to watch. She just flops and rolls all over the mat, squawking and making these shrieky furious noises. It only stops when you’ve given her sufficient head-scritches.

It only happens when someone comes home, and it *has* to be on a mat. If you come home and walk into the living room, she will run straight past you and into the bathroom to begin squawking and flopping on the mat. 

Eventually, I sort of put two and two together and realized that I must have petted her without really noticing it when I came home, probably when she was sitting on a mat. And that over the years, that bit of validation led to increasingly weird compulsive behaviour. "
