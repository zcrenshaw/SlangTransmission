"I had an ex that was really into poop. 

The first time he sent me a dick pic he took it in his bathroom, and there was a HUGE poop floating in the toilet. I just kinda ignored it since we had just started dating and I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass him ‚Äî lol I was dumb in college. 

One time we were at my apartment and I excused myself to go poop. I guess I was gone for a while cuz he asked if I went poop. I reluctantly said yes, and he asked if he could go down on me. I was like, sure. But he went straight for the booty hole and was super disappointed that I had ‚Äúwiped thoroughly.‚Äù 

Nothing against those with poop fetishes but it definitely was NOT for me lol 

"
"From what I read she gave a lot of non verbal cues and he didn‚Äôt stop which is shitty

But as soon as she said no, he backed off and called her a car. And when she told him she felt uncomfortable, he apologized to her and acknowledged he misunderstood what was going on 



I mean it‚Äôs a shitty experience for sure, but once she started clarifying where she was at, Aziz handled it way better than any dude I‚Äôve been in that kind of situation with. 


This is why I‚Äôm a big fan of actively consenting and not relying on showing disinterest - it prevents situations like this from happening on both sides. He should have asked earlier, and she could have said to stop when she started feeling uncomfortable 


I don‚Äôt want to diminish her experience but it sounds like a fuckup and a bad date/sexual experience, and not something malicious on his end. I‚Äôve been there. It sucks. I feel bad for the woman who had a bad experience.


But it concerns me that every bad date and misreading of signals and misinterpretation of non verbal cues could be discussed as assault. "
"When they tease you to the point that you have to beg for them to fuck you. Not a lot of guys have the self control to do that, they just wanna get right to the sex."
"I'm pushing 60.  I miss energy.  I miss joints that did not ache.  I miss dancing all night.  

I have two regrets.  One is not being with my father when he died.  More for my Mom's sake.  The other regret is being not protective enough of my own emotional well being.  It is a difficult line to draw, between being careful and cynical and I erred on the side of incaution. 


I have to add more regrets.  I regret not having hot wonderful sex with that one guy. We both wanted to.  I regret not telling some of my relatives to fuck off and mind their own business.  I regret trying to help a mentally ill cousin.  I endangered myself.  I regret waiting 5 months to move in with my now husband.  That was a lousy job and I owed them nothing.  I regret being embarrassed over some stupid stuff.  

Anyway.  Have fun with your lives Y'all. eat delicious food.  Drink.  Have lots of happy nooky.  Dance.  Go for a long walk.  Fall in love.  It's all worth it.  And for crying out loud take care of your teeth."
"Had one man that wanted to breed me.

He told me it was a lifestyle,  more than a kink.

When he told me he wanted to impregnate me...repeatedly... untill I could no longer physically do it, I told him i was out. "
"I think it gets muddied, on first read, because there are so many parts of it where the woman apparently willingly went along with the encounter ‚Äî even if she was uncomfortable ‚Äî so it‚Äôs easy to see that as the defining part of it. 

However, go through it again and add up all the times where Ansari continued to push sexual engagement after she had expressed discomfort or resistance. He‚Äôd step back, but then immediately try again, over and over; like, if someone physically moves away from you, don‚Äôt follow them and try to jam your fingers in their vagina. If you ask if you should get a condom and they indicate not until ‚Äúnext time,‚Äù don‚Äôt pour booze and ask if that means it‚Äôs next time yet. 

If they say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to feel forced‚Äù and express a desire to slow down, don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre going to do so, then whip out your dick and ask for oral sex. If someone wants to put their clothes back on, don‚Äôt try to take them off minutes later without having any sort of discussion about it. 

What becomes clear is that Ansari didn‚Äôt do anything whatsoever to ensure she was comfortable and truly consenting; all he did was keep trying to overcome her resistance and discomfort, and advance the encounter towards intercourse. 

That‚Äôs highly coercive, high-pressure behaviour and certainly doesn‚Äôt prioritize affirmative consent. I don‚Äôt entirely blame him for getting ‚Äúmixed messages,‚Äù but frankly if you‚Äôre getting mixed messages you need to *stop, back off and verify which message is correct,* not just ignore the ‚Äúmixed‚Äù part and push forward to what *you* want. 

To me, I think this story also underlines the fact that... look, ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù is a pretty common response to sexual pressure, and the woman‚Äôs description of her experience certainly suggests she was having some of that response. 

And I often think we could do a better job helping people learn how to counteract the freeze instinct, when it‚Äôs safe to do so. That‚Äôs not at all to blame the woman in this instance, to be clear. Most of us have had the freeze instinct at some point; it‚Äôs not a bad thing, it can save lives in different situations. But it‚Äôs just a broader thought. "
"That quote ‚Äúbe who you needed when you were younger‚Äù hit home with me and I strive to be that person every day. I like me. I like who I am. I like the direction I‚Äôm going. Why wouldn‚Äôt I own it? 


Faking it till you make it really does work. "
"I‚Äôm going to assume they don‚Äôt try to sleep as long as possible and then get ready in less than 30 minutes. 

I usually look like I just rolled out of bed....because I just rolled out of bed. "
"Effort and practice. 

Makeup primer and good quality products will last all day if applied correctly. Volumizing sprays can help your hair. Clothes that are knit fabrics are less prone to wrinkling. Eating right and exercising are the keys to staying in shape but that shouldn‚Äôt be a shock to anyone. Skin requires good genes, good health, and good skincare."
"Douches. Ever since I was 12 years old, I think I‚Äôve never heard anyone mention them without an immediate ‚ÄúAND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY BAD FOR YOU SO DON‚ÄôT USE THEM.‚Äù And they‚Äôre still in every drugstore! I suspect I‚Äôm surrounded by secret armies of women with totally hardcore vaginas that just scoff at the puny flower-scented rinses the world throws at them. 

Edit: I‚Äôm pretty sure my highest rated comment ever is now about douches. Talk about things you won‚Äôt mention at the water cooler tomorrow. ü§£"
Hepatitis C ya later.
"donate money to food banks, then they can get what they need. Most food banks buy bulk at wholesale prices, so even if you give food they need, chances are the foodbank can get more food from your donation if you donate cash.

If you donate food and it's not what the foodbank needs, they must sell it (probably very cheaply) and use the money to buy something else, again your money goes further if you just donate money."
"I kind of feel like some of these answers are wholly missing the point. An abuser is **not** going to be someone who treats other people poorly in front of you. An abuser is going to treat the waitstaff better than he treats you. An abuser is going to hold his mother on a pedestal that you will never be good enough to reach. People who are shitty to their family or to other people around them are just that - shitty. An abuser is a manipulative master of what they do. 

1. If they ""accidentally"" go through something personal of yours.
2. If they start attempting to limit who you spend time with or how you spend time. 
3. If they claim to have all of the exact same interests as you.
4. They will resist doing anything they have asked you to do. Example: He makes you delete a certain guy off your Facebook, but says you're being silly for wanting him to delete some girl off Snapchat.
5. If they refuse to believe you about something small, even playful. 

There are no hard and fast rules, and it will escalate quickly into more major red flags. "
"Besides the obvious (lose weight, work on yourself), realize that while the majority of people might not find you conventionally attractive, some people do. 

If there is something about your appearance that you hate but can be fixed (weight, teeth, hair), figure out ways to fix it. You need to be happy with yourself but not for anyone else. Wear the kind of makeup you want to wear. Realize that people are way too invested in themselves to worry too much about you. The ones who DO focus on your issues are paranoid themselves about what others think. "
"You are seriously forgetting one thing, everyone doesnt have the same standard of ""beauty"". My niece is a smart young woman, like jeopardy smart and she speaks well and can hold a conversation on anything. She is a multi instrument musician and in school for dance in NYC, I love the girl dearly she and her sisters came to our home when their father (my brother) died of pancreatic cancer. Her mother was killed in a car wreck when the girls were very young and never really raised them just took care of them as babies. My wife was her role model so to speak and taught her to be herself and how to be happy in her skin. My wife isnt the makeup and hair do type we grew up on farms and still own our farm where the girls all lived. Now my niece isnt unattractive but she is plain and lives simply, she is clean and does dress approperately but unlike her sisters she isnt curvy or very femme. She also has a pretty bad scar from a burn on her jaw line and left neck from a bonfire a boy tossed a few spray cans into so she was very self conscious as a teen but my wife was sted fast in telling her its OK and go back out and just enjoy the time your with your friends. All through high school she never really had a boyfriend or girlfriend but we just loved her up when we could and sent her back out when she wanted. While she was earning her Physical therapy degree before dance school she met a young man that was much like her at a PT seminar. He is a very brite, outdoorsey guy who is a tad skinny and short compaired to me and her male cousins but they clicked and traveled a bit and now share an apartment in NYC. He proposed this fall on the Amtrac leaf peeper in Saratoga. Its not your weight, its not your scars it is just not your time yet. Be you and enjoy the world, get out do things and you will see what happens. Or disregard the 20 minutes I spent telling you this and chalk it up that Im just a crazy old man. You choose."
"Years ago when I was in college, I started a summer job where I worked with a wide array of people.  There was one older man who everyone talked about him affectionately, but he just gave me the creeps. He would go out of his way to find me and talk to me on his shift, give strange looks, and offer to walk me to my car at night. Turns out...he was just a really nice older man who liked to talk was very awkward. I finally saw him talking to a group of people and turns out he wasn‚Äôt picking up on any social cues, male or female. I really saw how wrong I was about him when I met his wife of 35ish years! She brought him his lunch one night when he forgot it...two awkward and talkative peas in a pod! "
"I had a few dates with one man until he admitted that he got off sexually to acting like a child. And he would want me to act like his mom. 


I noped out of there as respectfully as I could."
"I HATE scented tampons! That box stank up my drawer at work the whole time I had it, and it's such a distinct scent that any girl can tell exactly what it is.

Surprised still exists? Now, I might be in the minority here, but who the hell likes those ribbed condoms? I tried those a few times and it just feels like it's grating my vag away. So uncomfortable."
I'd never date a guy who was anti-abortion or even on the fence about it.
What the hell that sounds like such an expensive kink 
"I tried those *once* in college. I made him pull out and proceeded to cry in the shower. Never again, spicy condom! "
"My sister realized one day that she was a pretty entitled, mean person. She'd been told so quite a bit but realized she wasn't just *being* mean, she *was* mean. She decided that's not who she wanted to be and changed just like that. A lot of it was fake-it-til-you-make-it but it worked for her and she has a lot more consideration and kindness nowadays."
"The biggest early red flag that I can think of in hindsight would be extreme jealousy. At the time, they will try to convince you that they just love you so much that seeing you around other guys makes them insecure. Or they‚Äôll say that they know how guys think and that you‚Äôre so beautiful that other guys couldn‚Äôt help but notice you.

Eventually, that jealousy will likely extend to your friends and family. Abusers want to isolate you. By the time I broke up with him, my abusive ex started a fight with me because I didn‚Äôt tell him that I was *going to the mall with my dad*. 

Which brings me to my second early red flag, and that is them trying to undermine your relationships with your friends and family. ‚ÄúListen babe, I hate to tell you this but I heard that [best friend] is talking badly about you and I thought you should know.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúI like [best friend], but don‚Äôt you think she seems a little [insert negative trait here]?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúDo you really think it‚Äôs healthy to be so close to your parents? I just don‚Äôt want you to be too codependent.‚Äù They plant seeds of doubt and then they water them. At first you might fight it, but gradually you start to doubt your loved ones. Then they start to confront you or get distant or bad mouth your boyfriend because they notice you‚Äôve been acting weird, but with your abusive SO whispering in your ear you see these as attacks and/or signs of him being right. By the time you realize what happened, you‚Äôre isolated."
"The segment of the population who responds to you on reddit is going to be very different than the general population.  Reading everyone's answers here has me nodding because they are all good comments for someone who wants to be healthy, but having volunteered for years at a food bank, I can also say that the kinds of foods that people vocally told us what they wanted do not line up with what people are saying here in the comments.  But I worked at a food bank that served a lot of low income families with kids, and many of these families didn't care or know about nutrition to the extent that people in these comments do.  People wanted sugary cereals because it's what their kids loved, they wanted canned veggies because they kept longer, they hated and rice and beans cuz their kids didn't like it (even though it'll get them the most nutrition for the cheapest amount), they loved ramen noodles.  The best product: poptarts wouldn't last on our shelves for more than ten minutes.  What people on reddit want does not reflect what people at my food bank want in the slightest... but keep in mind, I've only worked at two different food banks (but both with similar populations of people).  So take what I say with a grain of salt too, but just offering a different perspective."
Another case of impossible beauty standards imposed on women. 
"Myself, when I went from an abusive relationship to a wonderful relationship. Submissive and scared and sad to happy and confident and just laughing all the time. I still have things to work through but life is so bright most of the time."
"I like to think of myself as my best friend. I'm the only one who will always be there for me. I would never say a negative thing to my friend and therefore won't say a negative thing to myself.
Sometimes you have your down days, but as a few others have said, you actively say ""no"" to those comments."
Moan. 
"Still Waters run deep. The introvert men I've met are actually shy and it takes a while to ""warm up"" with them, but those I know are really really intelligent, interesting conversational partners, well-educated, full of interesting thoughts and ideas and reliable, respectful. And they don't brag! I find guys who show-off and are desperate to impress women really disgusting. "
"My stereotypical, rigid military dad became a chill artist."
"I once had a guy tell me he wanted to ""stretch [my] titties into udders and milk [me] like a cow."" Actual quote. I passed on that one. "
"if you ever feel the urge to make them hurt with your words, it's time to step away. it's unacceptable to turn an argument into verbal abuse, and you shouldn't accept hurtful words from your partner, either. similarly, step back if you feel the urge to ''win'' or your partner seems to care more about winning than solving the problem."
"Let's forget the science, for the purposes of a joke."
If they voted and support Donald Trump. Thats something I can never understand. I don't know if this makes sense but I kinda classify trump supporters as a completely different political party
"I bought scented tampons once.  I didn't notice they were scented, and in fact didn't even know scented tampons existed. So when I pulled one out of my vag and the perfume mixed with the period smell, it smelled exactly like rotten meat - bloody, and sickly sweet.  I was half convinced I had some sort of infection, until I realized what the smell was. "
"When they seem really into the parts of sex that don‚Äôt really give them any direct pleasure (like foreplay, oral sex etc). "
In a similar category: pads without wings.
"They're generally not chest beating, blowhard, alpha-dog wannabes.  
In other words, impressing people isn't their #1 goal in life."
"Instead of asking me to switch positions or move down a bit, grabbing me and throwing me into that position or grabbing my body and pulling it down the bed. "
"I dated a guy who was into quicksand. Like watching people sink in it? Idk, we only dated for like 6 months almost 10 years ago. "
He got turned on by me belching. Like he'd get an erection everytime I burped.
"My first SO wanted to role play and fantasized about me, having a dick. I learned about futanari from them, and they repeatedly asked me to do pegging (never did it) They asked me to dirty talk about me pounding them with my huge dick, they asked me to fist their asshole once and I did. In their words ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost the perfect girl, you‚Äôre just missing a thick meaty cock.‚Äù

"
"That's not how I felt when reading her account of it. She went to the bathroom to calm down, came out, and told him she didn't want to feel forced because she'd hate him.

By her account, his response was to reassure her verbally, telling her they should go over to the couch and chill, and then immediately instruct her to blow him.

She then said no again after he rubbed his penis against her butt. He again walked her to the couch and kept trying to undo her pants.

I don't think he handled it all that well. "
"I accidentally bought scented pads!! I thought it was just a prettier box, the ""scented"" print was so teeny tiny. They're awful.

Also, *why* do they make scented tampons??? It's *inside* of you. "
"1. While you kiss their ear neck, whisper in their ear what you‚Äôre going to do to them, maybe while playing with the nipples, or a little on the clit.
2.  If you have a cock, rub it on their clit/vaginal opening, talk about how wet they are and how much you want to feel their pussy around it.  But DO NOT FUCK THEM YET.
3. Kiss from the toes up to the neck.  Linger around the clit so they think you‚Äôre about to go down but don‚Äôt.  Maybe lick the clit ONCE and move on.
4. Gently, lightly flick your tongue over the nipples once or twice.  Not full on sucking that is for later while fucking, we‚Äôre just teasing now.
5. If your partner is into it, while standing behind them, tell them to stand still, that they can‚Äôt kiss you, while you run your hands all over their body, play with nipples, the clit a bit.  When the moans have increased significantly, and their hips are doing that unconsciously moving thing, turn them around and kiss hard.  Here, if you have a cock, press it into them while making out and have the lady grind their hips into you.
6.  Have clothing come off SLOWLY.  One piece at a time.  After the shirt is off, making out, kiss the neck, and do a little dry humping.  Take the pants off, repeat, more dry humping, maybe rub the pussy over the underwear.  Tease your fingers around the edges of the underwear, like slip a fingertip just under the underwear to tease the idea of being fingered.
7. Press the tip of your finger on the vaginal opening when wet.  Don‚Äôt jam it in!  And don‚Äôt just stick your whole finger in!  Apply a little light pressure, feel the vagina give and let maybe one knuckle‚Äôs worth, even less inside the pussy and let it sit there.  Ask if they want more.  Hopefully you‚Äôll have some unconscious hip moving and a breathy yes.
8. While dressed but making out, describe in excruciating detail what you are going to do.  Here if the lady tries to speed things up, in a playful way, say no, and force things to go slow.  Quite a few women (not all) enjoy an in the moment denial like this as it means they have to suffer that sexy ache to be filled longer before the release of fucking.  This is teasing.
9. Eat pussy lightly, make out.  Eat more pussy, make out.  Finger the ass a little while eating pussy.  Then make out.  Stop making out completely but  keep your cock between her legs and whisper how much you want her, how you‚Äôve been thinking about fucking her all day, how you want her tight wet pussy on your cock, to hear her moan.  Hopefully this will prompt the unconscious hip grinding.  That‚Äôs always a good sign.  Now go back to eating pussy, but with more gusto this time.
10. Blindfold.  An oldie but a goodie.  The lady will not know where you will strike next, sucking on her tits?  Biting her neck?  Licking the clit?
11. Go SLOOOOOOW.  Applies to everything above.  Don‚Äôt go straight to jackhammer fucking.  I like to slide in, thrust once or twice, the pull out and make out.  Hopefully at that point the lady is craving to get fucked, and I give them a taste, a tease.  Then make out, and ask them if they want to get fucked.  This often gets a breathy, desperate ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù

That‚Äôs a few ideas.  Sorry typos, on mah phone.  Also I‚Äôm a hetero dude but a lot of this could apply to anyone doing sexy stuff to another person, tweaked (heh) as needed for gender/sexual orientations. Also of course not all things work on everyone, everyone is different and figuring out what they respond best to is a team effort and takes communication.  Have fun!"

I met a guy who had worked for an orthopedic surgeon and his kink was casting a woman‚Äôs leg (she had to be wearing colored tights) and then carrying her around and taking care of her. 
"I miss my lack of hangovers. Now two beers gives me a headache.


Other than that, I'm much happier in my thirties. I'm more confident; people take me seriously finally, and my career + love life is finally in a good place. And I have money now."
"This is going to sound kind of douchey when put into words, but I've honestly earned my own respect over the years. I've always had pretty high standards for myself (go to the gym, work hard, don't half-ass things, try my hardest in relationships, etc) and over the years that stuff really adds up. 

I have confidence not from knowing I'll succeed at any given thing, but from knowing I'm resilient and can handle either success or failure. "
"My dad's ex-girlfriend -- she injured her dominant hand in a work accident and became addicted to the pain killers she was prescribed; not helped by the fact that she was soon mixing them with a ton of alcohol. Since she already had a bit of a drinking problem and she was unable to work, she very quickly spiralled out of control. She went from the sweetest, most caring woman that I have ever met, to a spiteful and suspicious addict with only two moods: irritated or furious.

She had been like a surrogate mother for me for the last year or so, as I wasn't in contact with my mom at 16 and 17. She taught me how to drive, she cut my hair for me, she was just *there* for me, and then she turned into an entirely different person. Like Jekyll and Hyde. "

"Not sure it qualifies as a kink, but I went on a date with this guy - first date - and after we went back to my car and started making out. 

He wanted me to go down on him, and I told him I wasn't going to do that in the front seat of my car. In response he asked me to ""just bite it a little through my jeans.""

To this day I am somewhat puzzled by this request. "
"A guy told that not only did he really like feet, but he was super into watching women step on soft food. He then said he needed it to get off, so we didn't go out again. "

"I started exploring some BDSM-themed activities in the bedroom with an ex of mine. After a couple months of dating he told me he had created a ""fun box"" for the two of us. I was into the idea at first (as I assumed it would contain something like handcuffs or rope) but when I actually looked in the box, I was horrified. The box was completely empty except for a box cutter. Somehow he'd made the jump from being interested in mild bondage to cutting/stabbing without me noticing. When I told him I wasn't interested in being cut, he told me he only wanted to cut off my tits. That was enough for me to call it quits. I ended the relationship and tried to make light of it by saying ""I hope I don't see you in the news for cutting up hookers or something."" He didn't think it was funny and we haven't spoken since."
"I am a father to two young boys, and I have been in a monogamous relationship with a woman for 27 years. So my knowledge of women is limited, which makes me a poor source of information about girls and women as my sons start hitting their teen years. 

This subreddit is a great way for someone like me to get a better sense of how women see the world. I am hoping it will make me a better dad.

Since I have only ever had and hope to continue only having sex with one person in my entire life, I find questions dealing with sexual practices to be most interesting, because this is such a huge gap in my knowledge about women. This is a subject matter I could never have a conversation about in real life.
"
"Assuming that her account of the situation is accurate, I would think (legally anyway) this probably wouldn't count as sexual assault.  However, I do find it pretty disturbing.

What's so gross is this repeated pattern that happens throughout their encounter... They fool around, he tries to push things further, she tell him she doesn't want to do that, he acts like he understands, but he continues trying to push things.  She even says at one point ""I don‚Äôt want to feel forced because then I‚Äôll hate you, and I‚Äôd rather not hate you.""  

That should have been a HUGE RED FLAG to anyone.  But he continued trying to push her into having sex with him.  

Some people are going to say she should have spoken up more, should have been more direct and forceful and tried to leave the situation sooner.  I'm sure she regrets not being more direct, but it's easy to say that once the situation has passed and you can look back on it with a clear head.  He definitely should have used better judgment.  "
"&gt; If they say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to feel forced‚Äù and express a desire to slow down, don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre going to do so, then whip out your dick and ask for oral sex

This is what put the story over the edge for me. Each time she indicated that she wasn't ready or didn't want to go any further, he outwardly agreed and then tried to push for more anyway. I've been in the kind of situation where someone keeps accepting your answer verbally but ignoring it physically and it can be really confusing and hard to deal with."
"My highschool friend comes in my mind. While his mom was still married to his asshole dad he was kind of awkward, quiet, and a bit mean. When his parents divorced, he became more relaxed, confident, fun, and witty. It was a great change. I hope he is still doing great."

Kiss my upper back and shoulders when behind me. 
"Well, it was not a person I was dating but I did have a guy whose kink was the idea of impregnating a woman. Hence during sex, the dirty talk revolved around getting me pregnant and so forth.

Of course, he did not want that to be a reality but the talk and thought alone did result in rather good sex!"
"I have a friend of mine who doesn't seem to have a personality of her own.  She kind of takes on and takes off personalities as she sees fit.  She has a base personality (nice, kind, smiles a lot, good sense of humor), but she'll always pick a new ""trait"" to really emphasize.  

For a few months she was emphasizing ""tomboy"" and changed the way she dressed, the activities she participated in, and the way she talked to fit this trait.  Then she became ""quirky"" and changed everything again, doing whatever she could to emphasize her quirks.  She's also been a ""hippie,"" ""boho,"" ""occult-oriented/mysterious,"" ""outdoorsey,"" ""country-hick,"" ""girly-girl,"" etc. throughout the years.  So she'll always still remain her base personality (kind, funny, etc.), but every few months she'll have some new dominant personality trait or interest that sort of becomes her identity."
My husband is the only man I've ever lived with so I can't generalize for all men... But I swear my husband does chores wrong on purpose so that I'll get pissed off and never ask him to do them again.

Rather than actually respecting her as a person and caring about her feelings, he‚Äôs toeing the line to be a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù who would ~never commit assault~ by pressuring her to give him an answer she doesn‚Äôt want to give. Like Jesus dude, if you ask someone to fuck you over and over again until you emotionally wear them down, even if they finally say ‚Äúyes‚Äù the 50th time you ask after an hour of harassment, *that doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt coerce them*!"
"Stomach aches.

He liked it when I had cramps, which is crud for sexy times. 

He asked when I felt better if I could fake having stomach cramps. I think it was the bending over holding my stomach part. I don't know. We didn't stay together long."
"How do they not collapse?? Any time I've accidentally purchased wing-less pads, they unstick from my underwear, roll over, and crinkle their sticky sides up onto me. It's painful and makes them useless, as I just drip over/around them if the absorbent side isn't facing up.

"I'm a white European currently living in the UAE.

One day while shaving my oxters, I noticed that they seemed paler than the rest of me, which is an accomplishment. I wracked my brains and eventually thought to check my deodorant. Indeed, I had accidentally bought ""fair and lovely"" deodorant instead of regular stuff.

I live in the UAE, I know a lot of women here view lighter skin as attractive, there's lots of face-creams and the like, but deodorant? Just... Why."

"Moaning, being vocal and dominant, telling me what they want. Also consideration. I used to sleep with a guy who during sex would ask if I was okay when we had sex the first time, not in a bad way, he also asked ""does that feel good"" and from then on there would just be questions having to do with what I wanted sexually. Communication and consideration are key for me. "
"&gt; Makeup primer and good quality products will last all day if applied correctly

Additionally, part of your primer is a good groundwork, ie; good skin. You get this through good skincare. I used to put makeup straight onto my face, no skincare, any skincare was washing my face in the shower and maybe I'd put on a moisturiser. However, since having an actual routine my skin is fucking amazing and makeup goes on WAY better (I know people say this a lot but I'm 30, a mature student at university and the 18 year olds thought I was at most 22. I had to show my driving licence for them to believe me).

"Met a guy online dating--for various reasons we couldn't meet up right away (traveling for jobs, deaths in the family ect) and ended up chatting for several months. I was willing to wait. He was amazingly Hot--movie star model hot. We ended up friends on FB and now, about 3 months have passed, still, no meet but we're chatting almost daily and getting along Really Well. Then, one night, out of the Blue, he starts asking me how I feel about people having fetishes, trying to feel me out about how straight-laced I am. I'm not, at all. He tells me he has an 'unusual' kink and it really turns him on just to think about it. He's hoping I might be willing to participate but he's embarrassed to tell me. I said, OK, go on. I'm very open-minded. After two more Days of prodding and letting him know I'm ""safe"" to talk to, he Finally admits..... he has a fantasy of watching women have sex with Dogs. I let him know, that's not my thing, will never happen. He didn't speak to me for months and then it was very stilted but weirdly enough, neither of us ever deleted the other from FB. It's literally been like 11-12 YEARS and we're still liking each other's posts, though we don't chat on messenger anymore. BTW, he's Still single, never married, never even engaged....and still, Drop Dead Ridiculously Gorgeous, even more so now that he's into bodybuilding. I'm single again....and Still...Nope.

"A friend, who in high school was determined at any cost to be a veterinarian. She took extra math classes so she could have advanced standing in college, volunteered every weekend at adoption events, and went to a college known for its vet program. 

Then she started partying a lot and hooking up with lots of guys, which that‚Äôs a somewhat typical college experience, except that became her main focus. She switched majors a few times, then started dating a guy in the marines. Got pregnant immediately after graduating, now has 4 kids and is a stay at home mom. "

"I spent thee years working as legal aid attorney in their domestic violence unit. I was officially a ""helpline attorney"", meaning I heard roughly 6-10 stories a day via telephone. While a LOT of these answers are great, I thought I would share a few less obvious signs/symptoms. Disclaimer: These signs/symptoms do not mean a person will be an abuser...though I would tread carefully if you see several of them.  THESE ARE NOT RED FLAGS...they are yellow flags.  

1) Large age difference. Women get wiser as they age, so abusers have to date younger and more naive women to compensate.

2) Quick involvement. A fast ""I love you"" is problematic. Spending all his time at your apartment after the third date is worse. Moving in with you without asking for permission after 2 months because ""he spends all his time here anyway"" is worst.

3) Wrapping manipulation inside of concern.  You see this ALL the time on /r/relationships.  Usually they operate to isolate the target from friends/family so they have no one to turn to to escape the abuse.  

&gt; I love you and got worried about you, which is why I flipped out and called your phone 30 times. 

&gt; Your friend Carla is a bad influence on you.  You should stop seeing her.   

&gt; I'm worried you'll fall and hurt yourself.  You should stop taking those dance classes with your mom.  

&gt; If you love me, you would stop talking to Chad.  What's more important?  My love or his friendship?  

4) Intense (but sometimes well hidden) Jealousy.  Policing what you wear, who you go out with, checking your phone, etc....all bad signs.  If he texts you and you fail to respond within 10 minutes and he flips out...it's because he thinks you're fucking someone else.

"Balancing being a singular person and a cohesive unit.

Sometimes it's not as difficult, and you naturally fall into tandem. But it can be very hard to know when you're compromising together versus compromising yourself in the inevitable issues. I had peaceful, easy relationships for years that I later realised were so easy because there was no resistance from me generally losing my sense of self entirely as a very passive person. There will always be a short end of a stick in a hard choice, but it can be difficult to find that balance without making one person carry the load."
"Not a kink exactly, but the contents definitely didn't match the description on the tin. I met a guy once at a kinky speed dating type scenario. We seemed to match up pretty well. I described myself as a 'vanilla kinky person' because what I was into - light bondage and occasionally spanking/anal - seemed very tame compared to what others were looking for. But he said that was exactly what he was looking for. So, we went out to the late night diner, talked for an hour or two, kissed in the parking lot... I went home, cautiously optimistic. I had to work the next day, he started texting me around noon, by 5 (with me responding once or twice, briefly, explaining I was busy at work) he'd sent me 20 or 30 texts telling me how he wanted us to both get our nipples pierced and matching tattoos and would I consider getting branded by him. I basically told him to lose my number and considered that a bullet dodged.

Also if he seems to be all about my body when he compliments me, it bugs me a bit. I want to be complimented for things I actually worked on. My body's fine, I guess, but I haven't put a ton of work into it, it's just sort of like this. 

And as another commenter said, if he ignores or overrides small refusals or saying no to small things. "
"This isn't super unusual, but my ex was really into squirting.  I don't think he discovered it was a thing until we'd been dating awhile because it never came up until a couple of years in, but once it did was was *obsessed* with making me do it.  Looked up ""how to"" videos and just would not accept that I couldn't do it and honestly his repeated attempts to make me was a big turn off."

"This is a very important lesson that I took away from a self help book that has served me well:

**""Did he do something TO hurt you? Or did he do something that happened to hurt you?""**

"As a bubbly/outgoing female, I‚Äôve been in a happy relationship with my shy guy for 7 years. What initially attracted me to him was that he showed his interest for me in really subtle ways, didn‚Äôt pursue me in a cocky/dominate way, and didn‚Äôt try to change me. Our relationship is such a nice balance. I draw out the fun-loving side of him, and he‚Äôs my steady and calm counterpart. "
Not at all. The feeling is mutual. Been married for 12 years. Zero intimacy in 3. Divorce looming on the horizon. We love each other but there just isn‚Äôt anything left.

"I'm 50. I exercise daily, keep my body in shape, use sunscreen and Botox, so I have no regrets about my body except that I can't run hurdles like I did in high school.

I miss my dead grandmas. I miss my dead dad. I miss my daughters being young. I wish I didn't get married so young at 24. I wish I didn't have any children before 30. I wish I had more self-confidence to do things alone like I do now that my kids are grown-up and my husband has bifurcated down another path and we have nothing in common. I wish I didn't have to watch my mom and step-dad get old and feeble. 

I think for the most part, high school and college and vet school were all what I expected, but then when I took a shitty job and my husband started in with passive-aggressive treatment that I thought was normal and so I just lived with it feeling like I did something bad, then I started having regrets. 

So my recommendations to any young woman is to do what you want first for you. Kids can wait, marriage can wait, and sometimes a career can wait. If you want to postpone college for a few years and work as a bartender in a Colorado ski town, do it. If you want a dog, go get one. If you want to hike the Appalachian Trail, do it. Spend time with the people who make you feel happy. Spend time with your mom and dad, because they won't be here forever.

"There was a guy that I went on one date with who about ten minutes into the date asked me if I knew what bukake was. I was only 19 and admittedly pretty naive and I did not know what that was then. He got really excited at the chance to explain it to me though. At the time I laughed it off but the conversation just kept coming (no pun intended) back to that one subject. He didn't really have the social skills to see how uncomfortable I was, or he just didn't care. This was before I had gained enough confidence to tell a man that he was creeping me the fuck out, so I eventually just made up some excuse to end the date and get home. 

About a week later I get a text asking me to come over to his place and cuddle, ugh."
"I generally rock up at work looking pretty polished; makeup and hair done, nice outfits etc. and it‚Äôs just a matter of being efficient.

"Love bombing- saying he ""loves"" you within weeks, buying you a multitude of presents, same interests to a tee. ""too good to be true"" feeling. Talking about his past relationships more than usual. Hovering (wanting to be with you more than a healthy amount) and checking in on you constantly.  

Then all of a sudden that all goes away after a few months. Get the hell out."
"I thought he was ok when we first met. Cute, but nothing special. Now I think he's the sexiest human being on the planet. Everything about him is attractive to me - his warm, relaxing voice, the way he frowns when he concentrates, his laugh, the little birthmark on his neck. He is stunningly beautiful. God, I love him so much."
"Reading the full account, it reminds me of a few dates I've been on where I wasn't clear, and where the guy's flirtiness could be mistaken as being creepy. Like asking about a second date, could be playful or could be shitty. 

When she said she felt forced, he said it's only fun if they are both having fun. When she started cuddling with him again, I can see why he thought she meant just sex and was ""having fun"" again. 


I mean he was pushy and aggressive and super, super shitty. I don't deny that. Once she did make it clear she wasn't into it, and he didn't stop, that was absolutely a huge fucking violation. 

With a lot of this, I think it's really indicative of the culture of dating, and men being encouraged to pursue and persuade women into sexual activity. I think his actions were awful. 


But... I dunno, something about this particular one just bothers me. 

Maybe I'm too dismissive of shitty dates and experiences, maybe I give too much room to what I see as a lot of things that could be misinterpreted on all sides. 


I think I sort of need to take a look at myself and figure out why I can see a few different options of how this went down, and why I'm interpreting it this way. "

"I grew up in the south where I never saw my mom, aunts or grandmother go to the store without makeup and always looked dolled up. Growing up, I have memories of my aunts coming over to do their nails, hair, they‚Äôd discuss clothes for hours. My mom always had her kids dressed in matching clothes and fancy dresses that almost looked like pageant dresses.

I just assumed everyone was like this because all my friends and cousins were the same way. It wasn‚Äôt until I moved off to college that I learned I was a product of my upbringing. I didn‚Äôt necessarily see it as a negative because my mom grew up in the same environment. It was just a trickled down effect over the years. So as an adult, I just have it ingrained in me that you get your hair done every four weeks, your nails and toes always match, sunless tans are a norm, so are eyelashes, etc. Where I live, you usually go do it with girlfriends, so it‚Äôs an afternoon together and just part of life. I‚Äôve lived in 8 states and 3 countries now, and I still find myself doing the ‚Äúgirly‚Äù things I love. I lived in Africa for 3 months in villages and dirt huts, but still took a ride to the city every couple weeks to get my nails done. Lol. It‚Äôs just something small I enjoy. "

"For the record, I'm pretty far left (perhaps I wouldn't be considered so in other countries, but I am in the US). Something I find annoying about the left in general (not the far left necessarily, but the left as a whole) is that there is a tendency to separate social issues from economic ones. I don't care how feminist/pro-LGBTQ/anti-racist/etc. a guy is if he is against things like labor unions, universal healthcare, social security, etc. Such an opinion indicates, to me, ignorance and a lack of compassion, two things that are big turn-offs for me.

"This account is very detailed, my hope is that people take the time to read it and not just rely on secondhand accounts I've read like ""she blew him and regretted it."" This is a really important conversation we need to have. 

That's not what happened. The girl was clearly not an enthusiastic participant to what was happening. According to her account, he was blocking her from moving away from him. She told him ""next time"" to try to get him to stop and then said ""I don't want to feel forced."" He had a nice response and then again prompted her to blow him. He kept putting her hand on his dick and she kept moving it away. He kept putting his fingers down her throat. When she said ""next time"" he reacted by giving her more alcohol and implying that they could consider this the second date. When she finally tells him no to sex, he says ""okay lets chill"" then tries to kiss her more and puts his hand down her pants while she sits there. At this point is when she says ""you're all the same."" She says at several points throughout the night she verbally and non-verbally communicated her discomfort. To me, this went beyond social obliviousness or awkwardness. This was a guy who was pressuring a girl because he wanted to have sex regardless of her comfort. 

Regardless of what you think about her actions, why are *hers* the only ones being scrutinized? *Why do we put more emphasis on her saying no than him confirming yes?* Again, the onus is on the woman to make sure that she's not assaulted. You cannot make me believe that he was could not pick up on these signals that she was not into it. We need to make sure we're having a correct conversation around consent. Just because you pressure someone enough to perform a sex act and they do is not ""enthusiastic consent."" You can't just wear someone down to get the result you want and then say everything was a-okay. This was a complete creeper move by Aziz, it's gross.

It definitely takes a shocking amount of money. Someone made a good post in /r/femalefashionadvice recently (I think it was that sub) about trying to become polished looking all the time and her biggest takeaway was how expensive and time-consuming it is.
" I did. He was the dad of one of my high school friends. We hung out at his house a lot, and the dad fancied himself a sort of mentor to some of the kids in our group. They would have long chats with him where he would give them advice and tell them about ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù dreams he had had about them that were meant to give direction to their life.  Everyone thought he was so spiritual and insightful, but I always thought it was creepy some middle aged man was pulling young girls aside and counseling them. I could never say anything because he was a friend‚Äôs dad and from the outside seemed like this upstanding, religious, well-liked dude. Fast forward a few years and he was arrested for selling meth to teenagers and trading sex for rent from tenants of apartments that he owned. Total double life. Everyone in our community was shocked, except me. "
"I'm not sure about ""interesting"" but I did learn that I was often a jerk when I was younger man. I had no fucking idea how wrong I was about some things... cat calls, asking a girl out while she's at work, making assumptions about sexuallity... and being really off base with rude insensitive comments I made to my SO of years ago.

I'll defend myself a little by saying that first, none of it was intentional. I have always adored women, and have always felt a standing impetus to be 'good' to women... all people really, but women, because through watching my Mom's experiences, and knowing my Dad was wrong in his teachings about women being inferior,  I felt they were often getting a bad hand, and yet through ignorance, despite my feelings and intentions, I hurt people anyway. Not physically mind you... emotionally, intellectually, I was an ass at times.

I like to think I'm a better person now. So... you'll have to make the judgment as to whether that's interesting or not... but I have enjoyed the experience in this sub and the education I've gained.

Edit: FWIW... I think my current SO is enjoying the benefits of my continued education... in a number of ways, some obvious, some not so much. ;)"
"I worked as an escort and I learned and catered to a lot of fetishes. I pretty regularly worked with BDSM, and I turned down any requests that would put someone in a hospital, but the absolutely worst thing I did was pour scalding hot water onto a guy whilst reading verses from the book of revelations. I was on top of him and actually teared up just from the little that splashed onto me.

The easiest ones were role playing fetishes, occupational ones like being a maid, nurse, secretary, and therapist (and actually being a therapist in some instances), some incest/oedipus style roleplaying. The most interesting one was a guy who asked me to wear exclusively blue, because he wanted me to pretend to be Violet from Willy Wonka, which involved me eating an insane amount of blueberries, and blueberry flavored flavored stuff, whilst describing how I was blowing up into a blueberry.

"I watch plain straight porn. Often times it looks like the things they do hurt the woman. Like, rubbing her clit like it was a stain on a wooden bench.

I was having none of it and then he whispered in my ear *""I'm going to fuck you for Nelson Mandela""* I burst out laughing and immediately told my friends. Dumb move on my part as I guess he took my reaction as enthusiasm and then he told me *""I'll fuck you so hard you'll forget that you're white""*

"&gt; To me, I think this story also underlines the fact that... look, ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù is a pretty common response to sexual pressure, and the woman‚Äôs description of her experience certainly suggests she was having some of that response.

I agree.

I'm reminded of a blog post I read yeeeears ago that spoke about how women interact in social situations compared to how we act in instances of attempted or completed sexual assault -- that post, though explicit, is [here.](https://fugitivus.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/another-post-about-rape-3/)"
"Also the whole bit about repeatedly putting her hand on his dick after she‚Äôs repeatedly moved it away. Just... no. If someone isn‚Äôt touching your dick, and repeatedly moves their hand away from your dick, that doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúmaybe the FIFTH time I put her hand there she‚Äôll wanna touch my dick.‚Äù "
". . . it‚Äôs pretty much the same, isn‚Äôt it? I mean, it‚Äôs not like kicking up a fuss when someone makes me uncomfortable (especially a man) ever goes over well for me in a social situation. Dude at a party keeps touching my back? If I raise my voice at him, *I‚Äôm* causing a scene. Women are taught our whole lives to be polite, smooth things over, don‚Äôt cause a fuss just because we‚Äôre uncomfortable. *Obviously* that‚Äôs how we react during sexual situations as well.

Edit: oh I started reading the article, it agrees with me lol whoops "
"As a general rule, unless you really mean it in general, make sure you don't make accusations about character but just the behavior. Like if they do something selfish say what they DID was selfish, not ""YOU are selfish."" There's really a big difference between the two."
I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. I'm mad that my depression has been back. 
Ok that‚Äôs really different from the account I read

Agreed! My local food bank advertises that every $1 donated turns into $5 worth of food. 
"I'm in my 40's.

I miss my body, I thought I was fat, I wasn't.

I don't miss the lack of self-esteem and being afraid to stand up for myself.

I wish I would not have tried so hard to placate my parents, but would have chosen a career that *I* wanted to pursue.  

I regret being so serious, I'm probably more carefree now in my 40's, more than I ever have been since I was a child.  I regret not enjoying my life more, I was so goal oriented, back then I had so few responsibilities, now I have a ton of them and the things I want to do are not possible, due to those burdens."
holy shit this is the stuff of horror movies
"I've read her account, and the texts, and it still sounds like a gross misread on his part and a total lack of assertion on hers. It sucks, but I don't think it can be said that he violated her."
What an unexpected and wholesome twist!
"As far as I can tell the only medically valid use is for post-op trans women, which is a really small market to keep inventory around for."
"I‚Äôll never understand guys who don‚Äôt like giving oral. It‚Äôs the fucking best feeling in the world being between her legs, hearing her moan, feeling her body quiver, and then looking up and seeing her in pure ecstasy "
"First date: he drove up in a hearse. Ok, quirky. Throughout the date, he kept on bringing up that he collected medical equipment from the 50‚Äôs and that he went to funeral auctions, even when I would change the subject. Eventually he mentioned that he had an embalming machine. I jokingly said, ‚ÄúA grown man who sleeps in a twin bed to leave room for his embalming machine.‚Äù That turned out to be true. I eventually flat out asked him if he had a medical fetish. Bingo. I was correct. "
"Since some have rightfully posted about others downturn with drugs and alcohol, I thought I'd share one but from the bottom up.  

I have almost a year clean and sober.   This is a huge deal.  February last year I checked myself into Hazelden in MN for extensive rehab.  I was broken in every way you can be.  Wife and kids, gone.  Everything I cared about, gone.  I was drinking a half gallon of straight vodka every day and anything else I could get into my system.   I was literally almost dead both from my addiction and my failed suicide attempt.  The detox and withdrawal were horiffic.  While in rehab my wife, rightfully, filed for divorce and got a protection order on me.  But.....i never fucking gave up.  

Fast forward to today, still can't believe it.  My family is back home.  No divorce, no protection order, health is good and getting better everyday.  Relationship with wife is better than ever, kids better than ever.  I am active in AA, am treasurer of one meeting and chairperson for another.  Have a whole new set of friends, a God of my own understanding and I enjoy my life for the first time ever.  

I am by no means the norm, but am a result of very hard work and fierce determination to get well or die fucking trying.  When I started it didn't make any difference to me.  

People can, and do, recover.  It works IF you work it.  

Thanks for letting me share. "
"I've always been kind of indifferent to Oprah, but I cried during her speech. I thought it was beautiful and very powerful. She's a great speaker. And though she may not have had very many roles, her work as a producer alone is worthy of acclaim. 

Having said that, a lot of the Me Too stuff made me surprisingly annoyed this year. I love movies more than anything, and think diversity is so important. But these Hollywood types are patting themselves on the back when they've made such little progress over the years. The whole thing is just lip service. Even in a year where Lady Bird won best picture, Gerwig wasn't nominated for best director. 

I feel like everyone in the audience felt they were part of the solution, and patted themselves on the back for it. But so many of them are part of the problem. Every producer who won't hire female directors, every writer who can't pass the Bechdel test, every director who insists on filming some scene where the woman is needlessly naked - you guys don't get to applaud yourselves. "
. . . many of us don‚Äôt like the idea that sexual experiences we‚Äôve categorized as ‚Äúbad but no big deal‚Äù actually involved coercion or assault and so we avoid naming similar experiences that happen to other people as coercion or assault as well.
"He's an asshole, not a rapist. I am interested in finding out if this is part of a pattern of disgusting behavior, or an isolated incident."
I just want to wear gowns and fancy dresses in everyday life.
"Oxters is a Scottish word for armpits. It's one of those words (like moist) that is disgusting to say, but brings a certain amount of satisfaction."
Does that include the cry because it's yet another day?
"You'd be surprised how common that path is for trans women: quiet and nerdy because of low self esteem due to gender issues, then high femme because you feel you have to ""perform femininity"" then finally mellow out once you get into the groove of transition. Or stay high femme. Nothing wrong with that either. "
"My boyfriend is an AGM for a fancy members only club. They sent him out to buy tampons for the ladies room amongst other things. When he called me to inquire on what to get, I told him to get a name brand, assorted pack but the most important part was that it said UNSCENTED. I swear they put the scented/unscented factor in the smallest font and it‚Äôs the most important part of a tampon...... off-brand, not the perfect tampon size you need, sure but no one wants a scented tampon. "
Do not use scented pads or tampons they are awful for your PH. I am one of those people who can smell anything a mile away...it does not hide the scent it still smells like you are on your period with flowers shoved up thereüò≠
"I never use pads with wings.  It feels too bulky, so I‚Äôm constantly aware of it."
"Slightly off topic, but I had a drunk girl (I‚Äôm also a girl) ask me to come home with her, I told her no, but I‚Äôd walk her home to make sure she was okay. When we got to her door, I told her bye and she leaned in and told me ‚ÄúI want to fuck you, cuddle you, and make you scramble eggs in the morning.‚Äù 

I honestly just started giggling because it was such a good line. I made sure she got in her apartment safe and went back to the bar, and never saw her again. But I‚Äôll always remember that line. Sometimes they‚Äôre wholesome. "
"NAIR!!!!

Like wtf??? That shit has to be awful for you. Also when I was like 15 I tried to use it for my pubes and that shit burned for days. 

Ps. Menstrual cups are amazing every lady should use one. They are more comfortable, hold more blood, no chance of toxic shock syndrome, WAY better for environment, and you save money! What‚Äôs not to love?"
"Anti abortion/contraception. Anti LGBT. Anti immigration. Pro-private healthcare. Pro-hunting. Anti-environmental.

I think there was a RadioLab segment where the host was researching the history of quicksand in film (ie old fashioned horror stuff) and stumbled on an internet culture of people who fetishized quicksand.  Some liked watching other people sink and some liked doing the sinking.
"I agree with what people have already posted, so I'll add an odd one from my situation. 

A dislike for real affection. 

As a charmer, he loved giving people big hugs and warm handshakes. In private after the ""love bombing"" stage, when I'd try to hug or cuddle, he'd turn it into a headlock or other aggressive maneuver. Or when I'd try to hold his hand, he'd make a fist and try to crush my fingers. This was not playful wrestling either.   "
"If they ignore you or overrides you when you say no, even to something as small as getting dessert or putting a scarf on. I make it a point to deliberately refuse new SOs something to see how they react. Potential abusers can't usually take a no, even a small one, and let it pass unchallenged. "
"Essentially it is a surgical site for a period of time and needs to be kept clean. The issue is you are using oil barrells full of lube daily within like 3 days of open body surgery and shoving hard plastic dildos into your new vagina. Douching cleans out the lube and helps with healing. 

After a certain point, you're healed up and while you are still dialting and using lkube, the amount goes down and there isnt as much need to clean out. After more time, your body adujsts, you get some natural flora going on (wtf is that anyway, bacteria or something?) And there Isn't a need to clean anything. Some girls still use lube for dilation and sex, some sorta fall off dialating, some produce adaquate lubrication for sex and that will pretty much replace dialation. 

So at a certain point douching for a trans woman would be just as bad as it would be for a cis woman. 

Edit: and questions are usually cool if you are nice, as you were."
"Guys that push for me to let them pick me up, drive me somewhere, meet me some place private.  Guys who get offended that I want to take basic safety precautions because ""they're not a serial killer, hur hur hur"".

"Nah your comments certainly aren't wrong. Sometimes we got cookies and cereal from the donations and that was awesome. When you're a kid you just wanna eat kid stuff. And when you're already in dire straights, parents just wanna provide their kids with the slightest sense of normalcy, and Pop tarts are definitely one way to do that.

I forgot to mention in my comment but while my family ate rice, we did not eat beans. None of us liked them. Beans definitely were a waste to us. Ground beef was number one, because you could stretch it with multiple pasta meals, it tastes good, and is super versatile."
"I don't like how unattractive the majority of the men in straight porn are. I also dislike how violent a good percentage of porn is nowadays. I can't stand the ridiculous fake moaning and squealing from the women in porn.

Did he have some sort of financial plan or budget to support these kids or something? Did he realize how much it was going to cost to raise all those kids. Damn.
"The onus should be on both of them. Aziz shouldn't have been an ass and she should have given clearer signals.

I hate the idea that all of the responsibility falls to the man when it comes to making sure a sexual situation is read correctly. I also hate the idea of putting all the blame on the woman in these situations for not communicating effectively enough.

Men shouldn't be expected to read women's minds and women shouldn't have to wear a giant blinking neon sign on their heads that says exactly what they want.

Both men and women need to do a better job of communicating with each other to prevent these situations from happening."
"Funny story about Douches and yes I agree they are BAD! My mother gave me terrible advice when I asked questions about my period. Basically, my period was brown at the end of it and smelt odd. Instead of talking to a doctor I thought, ""Hey my mom suffers from periods too! I should ask her."" She advises me to use a douche. 

In the store, I was looking at the various feminine cleaning products with different scents. I was embarrassed at the time for even buying any of those products. In my mind buying it would tell the world that I had a gross smelling vagina. So my lovely boyfriend in Rite Aid said oh so loudly holding a douche product; ""Honey! Your vagina can smell like an ISLAND!"" There were at least 3 other people in the same aisle as us, as I laughed from utter and complete embarrassment. 

In the end, the douche did not help me, I was only spotting. The end result was a UTI and burning sensation in my lady parts. Don't use douches. It's not worth that island smell. "
"While I totally agree with many of the comments here about practice, effort, and time.  I think it particularly comes down to confidence and also just know that you're your own biggest critic. Other people are not very likely to notice or care that your makeup gets a little smudged throughout the day but it's likely the first thing you notice when you look in the mirror. Realizing this about myself and realizing that other women are concerned about the same things and therefore worrying more about themselves than taking the time to judge me has helped my confidence immensely. "
"There's this voice my boyfriend has. I can barely even think about it without getting all ansy. When he talks it's a mix of that desperate ""I can't wait to bend you over a desk in the next few minutes"" and ""I'm going to tease you because I like seeing you squirm"". I can hear in his voice that he's showing restraint and not going as fast as he wants to, but by god he wants to go fast. 

So yeah, that? "
"32 y/o here. I don't think there's anything I miss that is about age. I definitely don't miss guys treating me like I would be easier to fool because I was in my 20s, not just older guys but also guys who were my age. I wish I had learned how to set boundaries and tell my expectations sooner. I regret not doing that, especially in one particular dating situation, and kind of shutting myself to the pointers I was told by friends and strangers."
"My ex went from being a super sweet man, who‚Äôd give you the shirt off his back, would surprise me with flowers and even himself once.... to someone I didn‚Äôt recognize within weeks. Together five years and suddenly stopped communicating and backed out of our wedding three weeks beforehand, literally ran away from our life and didn‚Äôt come home for five months. He stayed for a day and left again, transitions between downright mean to saying he wished he‚Äôd stayed. I don‚Äôt know who he is anymore. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. "
"It's miles better than AskReddit or your brother sub in terms of attitudes about women, rape culture, and pretty much everything. It's hard to pin down anything I've learned about women *in general* from this sub since it's made up of so many unique individuals, but I will say that many years ago I learned what the clitoris was from this sub."

"withstanding periods of dislike when you've been together more than 3-4 years. and resisting the cultural narrative that says if you don't LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF your partner 100% of the time, you need to leave.

"This is probably only specific to some abusers, specifically not the complete sociopaths, but the ones who are very pitiful and talk about how much their parents or exes have abused them. These types of abusers get you to feel sorry for them; maybe you had an abusive childhood too and are especially empathetic towards them. You chalk up their bad behaviors or mistreatment of you to their past abuse when in reality none of it is an excuse for their acting like an asshole. It's fine to open up about one's past and be honest but it's another matter to act out their anger of past abusers out on you."
"So this.  I commented elsewhere in the thread that I worked with a food bank for a decade, and their ""want list"" was not anything I typically buy, but there were lifestyle based reasons that made solid sense for all of them.  Canned veggies, instant foods (instant mashed potatoes and instant rice were a huge want), canned fruit, peanut butter, boxed cereals and cheap plain jarred spaghetti sauces are probably not most people's idea of ""good food"" but they fit the needs of people with limited access to food storage/preparation/refrigeration and or for families with young children who are used to eating what's cheap and available instead of a regular diet of high quality food.  It comes down to whether you want to help, or whether you want to proselytize.  Of course in an ideal world, we'd all have consistent  access to good quality fresh food and a well equipped kitchen to prepare it in (plus the skills to do it well), but since you can't guarantee that for anyone, meeting them where they currently are is a lot more helpful.  "
"I didn't interact a whole lot with girls or women (aside from my sister and mother) as a child / young adult (long story short: bullying lead to me avoiding girls and becoming very shy around them for way too long). I stumbled upon this sub shortly after I started using reddit about... 5-6 years ago? I lurked for a bit, and found it interesting to hear the perspectives of women on various subjects. I don't really feel comfortable on most of the AskMen-equivalent subs, and I more often feel like I can relate to posters here.

The most interesting thing I've learnt about women is that they aren't some weird, mysterious species, and that they deal with things that I've had to deal with myself (reading tons of posts about women with insecurities has helped relieve many of my own), but perhaps more importantly, things that I *don't* have to deal with.

It's difficult to condense the past 5-6 years I've spent here into a few paragraphs, but my time here has helped me tremendously in my interactions with women in real life, and stop being as scared as I used to be. The amount of anxiety I felt the first dozen times I commented in this sub is ridiculous. :P

Aside from that, I've become more aware of sexism and my own contributions to it, and I think I've gotten better at catching and stopping myself. Not just in terms of how I think about women, but how I think about myself as a man (i.e. not be ashamed of doing typically ""feminine"" things). Aside from reading funny or just generally interesting threads, I think sexism is the primary topic that I keep visiting the sub for, hoping to keep educating myself. I realise AW doesn't represent all women, and I understand there are women of various walks of life that are underrepresented here, but I feel like it's a good place to start at least.

Ok, my thoughts are a bit all over the place, and I feel like it's showing in my writing, but hopefully it makes sense, lol."
"Or right before you have an event that's been weeks or months in the planning, he picks a fight or has an emotional breakdown. And if you don't stop and take care of it *right now* then you're ""abandoning"" him. And for some reason this keeps happening every time you want to do something he disapproves of - going to a concert, visiting a friend he dislikes, hanging out in any man's presence, etc. Strange how it never happens when you're at work or when you're just sitting at home with nothing to do, but the minute you have plans or exercise any form of independence, his ""anxiety"" flares up."
"It's not dramatic or harsh at all. I would've been devastated if my husband (fiance at the time of the election) had voted for Trump. To know that he, as a white man, would support this level of racism and misogyny while in a relationship with me as a black woman would have broken my heart. "
"I've mostly seen straight porn so this doesn't apply to gay/lesbian and everything else. 

How fake 99% of it is. The awkward moans and noises when she's not even being stimulated at all. How most of it isn't about making her feel good. How obvious it usually is that she's totally dry. How violent towards the woman a lot of the acts are, which is fine if you're both into those things and it's consensual but it's VERY common place in most porn, making it appear to be the ""norm."" How they treat anal sex. How unattractive the dude usually is. Most of it doesn't show realistic sex, it shows a dude doing things TO a woman, not doing them WITH her. That would be fine for certain genres, but it's like that in pretty much all of it. 

There's some better stuff out there but it's annoying that it's the minority."
"I don‚Äôt want to scar myself, is it safe to assume it‚Äôs just being super racist?"
I do that in the car on the way. Saves time.
I tried this with my parents when I was a teenager. They told me I just needed more practice and made me do them all the more 
"Gendered anything that doesn‚Äôt really require it?? Like pens, razors, etc. BIC for her?! Wtf. "
I'm ridiculously attracted to him and I have been since the first time we met. I always want to be touching him.
Maybe she's simply trying out new things and still finding herself? It's difficult to judge without firsthand experience but it doesn't sound that strange to me.
"Any mention of a ""crazy ex"". "
"My parents repeatedly created situations where my mom would have to choose between my dad and her kids and she always, always chose my dad. Memorable examples include when my mom kicked us all out of the house (ages 16, 15, and two two-year-olds) because the toddlers were crying and she didn't want dad to hear it, and another recently when she told my sister to keep quiet about being sexually assaulted by our brother in law because my dad thinks it was a one-time mistake and there's no use in hurting our other sister."
Any emotion other than happiness is regarded as invalid. A guy can be visibly mad and everyone knows to stay the fuck out of his way. A woman gets mad and everyone questions the validity of her anger. 
"I cammed with a guy who was into something very similar. Our first couple of sessions he just wanted me to call him daddy and act like his little girl. I know that‚Äôs weird for a lot of people but it‚Äôs pretty normal in the kink community.

Eventually he revealed he had a full blown adult baby fetish. I could not get into. I also work in childcare so it just made it weirder. I‚Äôll be honest though, I wore a diaper for him on camera once. Wasn‚Äôt the worst thing I ever did for money."
"I used to work at a grocery store that donated the dry goods to a food bank if they weren't sold on clearance.  After holidays, this obviously included a *lot* of chocolate.  We had to donate stuff fast because usually it was close to going out of code (obviously, we couldn't donate expired things, but they'd be within a month of expiring).  So they stuff would go on sale when we pulled from the shelf it a month before code or right after the holiday, then after a few days, we'd donate it.  Mega bargain hunters would be so furious with us if they missed the candy sales, and when told that the unsold candy went to the food bank, would flip.  ""That's not healthy for them, they don't need that, blablablablabla!""  Basically, they thought people who needed food banks didn't deserve treats. Whatever, I also volunteered at food banks and soup kitchens.  People using them like chocolate just as much as everyone else.  

Plus, you can donate both!  Veggie pasta and sugary cereal will both be accepted at the food bank.

One thing about stuff like rice and beans and frozen vegetables is that there's a presumption of ability to prepare those things.  Some people using the food banks may not have the means to store a 10 pound bag of dry beans, or cook them, or cook them in any sort of palatable way.  Some people using food banks may be homeless, or living in shelters, or living in poorly equipped apartments that don't have storage space or a full kitchen.  Many food banks don't take fresh or frozen foods because not only do they not have the means to store them, the people using them don't have the means to store them.  Yes, a chest freezer full of frozen veggies and bulk sacks of rice and beans are technically the cheapest way to feed your family healthy food.....but that assumes you've got a chest freezer, pantry space, and a working stove with all the right equipment and spices to make that a decent meal.  Some people using food pantries have these things, and some don't.  What's healthiest isn't always the most practical.  Dry cereal and Pop Tarts keep forever, travel well, and require no special equipment to eat.

I saw this question pop up a year or so ago on a different forum and one thing always stuck with me: basically anything canned, with a pull-top opening.  One woman gave a story of being homeless and eating from food banks and expressed so much frustration that she'd frequently get canned veggies, soup, pasta, etc. but couldn't actually eat it because they required a can opener.  Now I always try to donate stuff with pull-top openings."
"So much yes to this. But their limiting time with others will look more like: ""We already made plans to do XYZ together that night"" (an activity you might have discussed in passing, but never solidified) or ""I really wanted to surprise you with dinner/movie/etc at the exact same time as your plans, could you reschedule?"" Accompanied by emotional manipulation in the form of pouting and guilt tripping. This continues and escalates over time until you've drifted apart from all the people who might have warned you against the relationship. At which point they cease to use manipulation/persuasion and start to use fear and force."
"I learned to French braid my own hair in the 90‚Äôs in the back of a school bus on the way to cheer camp. The way we used to do it was to have someone who knew how sit in front of you and braid their own hair. You sat behind them and attempted to copy their movements.  Then, after a couple of practice runs like this, they sit behind you and correct you as you attempt to braid your own hair without the visual aid. I think I could get a messy braid after about four tries. I learned on a 4 hour bus ride.

If you lack a bus full of teenage girls who can braid their own hair, a YouTube video will do in a pinch."
"I remember thinking they must be so hard to find and I would have to search far and wide for them post-surgery.... then I realized they are literally everywhere and I was left scratching my head. Good for me but I really don't see what cis women use them for, and trans girls don't really need them after a few years post-surgery. "
"When I moved into my husband's house I did a mass cleaning as it was a bachelor pad before that. He had money everywhere, like hundreds of dollars in ones, fives, and tens. I asked him about it. He said, ""That's so when I get drunk and order pizza I can always find cash to pay."" I promptly told him he could keep SOME in the kitchen but needed to put the rest in his bank account. He also slept with a baseball bat by his bed ""for protection."" Also, pants and shoes EVERYWHERE. "
"I use a mix of verbal and nonverbal communication in every aspect of my life, including in sexual encounters. It is an important aspect of communication for me.

Nonverbal communication is not a ton of mysterious subtle cues that no person could possibly figure out. People rely on nonverbal cues in many encounters that aren't sexual every single day, but most people don't get bent out of shape about not being able to figure out those. If you incline a coffee pot towards someone's cup and raise your eyebrows, and they hold a hand up with the palm out and slightly shake their head, you have offered them coffee and they have refused. No one thinks that was unintelligible to use nonverbal cues. If you hand someone a cookie and they put it down, you don't pick it up and hand it to them again and again. You understand they have indicated that they don't want to eat the cookie at that moment. A sexual encounter should be no different."

"Sales person in a company I consult to. Made my skin crawl and his eyes made him look kind of slow/dumb but he was well liked by the staff.

I ended up having a firm discussion to ask him why he had not sold one promotion in 6 months. He quit on the spot.

Once he left the clients in his territory either told us 'we never saw him' (he was faking call reports); 'he told us [company] was going broke'; or 'he was sexist and inappropriate when he visited'."

"Honestly? First date. 

We started talking on Tinder and after a few days I was slightly day drunk on a Sunday at a banquet and asked if he wanted to meet me out for a drink after it. He agreed to it. He was funny and smart and cute and I was excited. 

While we were out, at our second bar of the night, a news flash came on the TV in front of us. And my phone was blowing up. Turns out a really good friend of mine I was just with the night before was drunk driving at like.. noon.. and rolled his car on the highway into another car that was parked on the side of the road with a flat and killed the guy that was standing outside the parked car. I lost it. Freaked out. Basically started ugly crying and felt so embarassed. 

This guy I was on a first date with could have been all, 'holy shit, that's really personal and a big deal and I'll leave you be.' But not him. He stuck around, made sure I was okay and texted me the next morning saying he was coming over after work with soup and a movie to make sure I wasn't alone. 

It's been almost a year. He's the most amazing partner I could have ever asked for. "

Turns out he allegedly was a rapist, poisoned an illegitimate kid he had in his home country that he fled from, made his wife let him perform two back alley abortions on her (and flushed the fetuses down the toilet), and would beat the shit out of his entire family including his wife in public.  He was also an accessory to criminal coercion to me and my wife (his daughter) during our wedding.  My wife said he was a narcissist a few years ago so in his annual ""you're a piece of shit but we'll accept your apology for not letting us abuse you"" email he clarified that he's not actually a narcissist and went off to list all the reasons on why he's so awesome."
It helps me to remember we're on the same team fighting the same problem.  Then we're not fighting with each other so much as brainstorming how to fight the problem together.
"How much they can eat. Even though my SO is fairly slight of build, he probably eats like 4x as much as I do and doesn't gain any weight. My food bills have definitely gone up!"
"Eye contact, being present. Fucking me like I‚Äôm the only thing in the world that he wants. "
"This is my absolute hard line as well. I've had an abortion in the past and am open about it, and I doubt someone who is anti-abortion would be interested in dating me anyway. But even if I hadn't, I still wouldn't be able to date someone who is against it. Being pregnant right now has made me more pro-choice than ever, especially since I would have an abortion again in some situations. "

"Just after the election, I remember an r/relationships post by a guy who voted for Trump about how his wife was now refusing to sleep with him and treating him coldly.  So fucking hilarious."
"I had a friend with a rape fetish. Which was a little disturbing to me at first but I didn‚Äôt read much into it. We all have are weird fetishes I guess. 

The issue was made worse when he asked me to tell him in detail about the first time I was sexually assaulted (when I was a preteen). We had, had a few beers and so I told him, not really thinking much about it. I figured he was just a concerned friend. At one point I look over and he was pulling out his hard dick to stroke and I just lost it on him. I was so hurt that we was getting turned on by an event in my life that was completely devastating to me. I don‚Äôt remember how many things I threw at the bastard. I told him if I ever saw him again he‚Äôd be lucky to keep his manhood. Kicked him out and only saw him a few times in public after that. "
"I find shy and introverted guys can be appealing when they are calm and self-confident, without having to draw attention to themselves or prove their masculinity. I've admired some introverted men because they had great intelligence and depth, and we had amazing conversations about interesting topics like theology, philosophy, the arts, spirituality, and so on."
So...umm... What are you up to on Friday?
"I've always thought small penis humiliation was strange, but it's fairly prevalent. "
"I've used the food bank in the past, and when I donate now I try to choose options that are healthier and that I know taste good canned/dry.

Canned tuna, green beans, corn, peas, spinach, and beans are all good, as well as dry beans and rice. Canned diced tomatoes, especially the kind with chilis in them. Soup.

One thing I do when I donate is to pick out the low sodium versions when possible. Many older people who use food banks have heart issues and are supposed to be on reduced sodium diets, which can be hard when you are eating so much from a can. 

ETA: since someone else mentioned pasta, that reminded me: whole wheat/added protein/hidden veggie pastas! That's another thing I donate now. These days the higher-nutrient pastas like these are about the same price as the regular stuff. Get the good stuff."
"The problem has never been ‚Äúgirls don‚Äôt find introverts attractive.‚Äù The problem has always been ‚Äúintroverts don‚Äôt meet NEARLY as many new people as extroverts.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt matter if 80% of girls find you attractive if you spend all of free your time in your room/with the same friend group. 

Not complaining, and not trying to discourage. Just putting it out there. "

"Personally, it gives me the the impression that he cares about more important things than all the useless small talk and social media blabber (says a person who's on Reddit, lol). In this world, not speaking and keeping to yourself is unique and I like unique."

I'm 25 and my hangovers are so ridiculous now even compared to a couple years ago. Ouch. 
"I prompted my SO to tell me what he really, really wants in bed. His wildest fantasy. 
He looked super embarrassed and eventually admitted he‚Äôd love to see me ride a dildo. Much to his astonishment, I pulled out a dildo and... well. 
He‚Äôs 32, veteran of Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, 6‚Äô6 of muscle with badass facial hair. 
I‚Äôm pleased to say I‚Äôve pushed his imagination a little and he‚Äôs now obsessed with rope bondage and wax play. "
"Knew a guy for almost 10 years, then married him. He was the nicest, giving, defensive (over me) guy I'd ever met. A few months after the wedding, he went full rage. Hitting me, yelling, blaming...I became a literal prisoner in my home. He bolted he windows shut, changed all of the locks on the doors to need a key to get in and out, took my phone during the day, took any key to any door/vehicle we had - even the tractor (in case I managed to escape), and forced me to have his children, who he also abused. One day, I managed to get away with my kids and everything I could fit into a Toyota Camry. The car was mine, but he didn't know I made a spare key to it and the deadbolt. 3 days later I beat the door down (literally) to get to him so he'd either sign the divorce papers or I was going to kill him. I'd had enough. I grew balls. He went from a near angel to the devil himself in 3 months. "
"In terms of romantic partners I've dated a guy that was into knife play and a guy that wanted to punch me in the stomach or be punched in the stomach.  The knife play was not my thing, but we never tried it and it wasn't the reason the relationship ended.  The punching was kind of annoying, but I liked the guy and we didn't do the punching every time we were intimate.  I'm really into BDSM and he didn't ever really commit or couldn't partake in a way that felt genuine.  For example, I asked him to pull my hair once, and instead of holding the hair and pulling it or using it to control my head, he kind of just held the hair and released it like squeezing a stress ball in a way that didn't inflict any pain and didn't assert any control.  I'm with a perv who makes me beg for anal now and the sex keeps getting better literally every time we fuck, so I feel like I've leveled up."

"I mean, he kept repeatedly putting her hand where his cock was despite the fact she kept pulling away among other stuff. 

I think the problem with sexual assault is that it's a HUGE spectrum. Sexual assault, by definition, is an act in which a person sexually touches another person without that person's consent, or ***coerces*** ~~or physically forces~~ ***a person to engage in a sexual act against their will***. 

Just because something was, say, 5% bad doesn't mean that it was not bad. It's still bad, just obviously much less so compared to truly awful stuff. You're still hurt if you cut yourself versus breaking your arm. Should we pretend like other pain isn't worth paying attention to just because it's not as bad?

I completely agree with you that this isn't legal territory but do feel like getting called out for your actions is a warranted response. He shouldn't lose his job or anything like that but he definitely shouldn't be using his celebrity to be able to pick up and engage in these same behaviors with other young women."
"Computer stuff. Proved myself by simply being good with technology. I have a degree but it's not in computer engineering. And honestly, I have skills that few people (women especially) have in tandem. 

I'm also good at negotiating my salary. I used to be shy about this but I've learned my lesson. You'd be surprised at how many companies are receptive to you when you are firm about your expectations. Recently got a 15k+ (above current salary) offer for simply telling them I was grateful for their offer but wasn't able to go below a certain limit. Men do this shit all the time. "
"For my field I make really good money, but I also have to get up each day and deal with godawful situations, abused kids and a broken system, so I got there by wanting to do it. (CPS worker)"
"Oh my god I tried one of these once. I was a guest at a friends wedding in the spring so my legs were pasty white from being hidden all winter so I thought that would be a great idea. It seemed to look fine at first, but the ceremony was outside, beautiful day, and my legs were DISCOBALL glittery in the bright sun. No idea the stuff had any kind of shimmer, but omg it looked ridiculous. "
Signs of life
Baking.  I can‚Äôt think of many things sexier than being brought a plate of fresh baked brownies in bed. 
"There wasn't a single ""Ah-hah!"" moment for me, but I knew within about two weeks of dating that I was going to marry this man.

A powerful indicator was when I got terrible gastroenteritis, about three weeks after we'd begun seeing one another. I was all but comatose, likely stinking to high heaven from everything coming out both ends. He came over and held my hand as I slept, cleaned the bathroom after I'd gone, and kept me company for hours. The poor thing ended up ill himself, and yet he refused to let me feel guilty; he said it was his choice to care for me.

I knew then he was a compassionate, strong man with integrity."
"Ooh, I hate the wings. I wear boxer brief-style underwear and the wings just squish the crotch into a weird horrible wad.  I've never leaked over the sides, I leak in the back or front so I have to get extra-longs.  "
Assistant TO THE regional manager 
"I did what he asked. My take on most things is ""if it doesn't hurt me and it doesn't cost a lot of money, why not do it?"" 

He didn't seem like, incredibly into it or anything as far as I remember. I think it would make more sense to me if he *had* been super into it, because then I'd just be like ""Well obviously that was an unusual fetish""."
Hang out with my husband and cats. Call our families to say goodbye. Just try to enjoy the hour we had left.

"That... isn't healthy, right?  "
"Cool girl, although that is changing as I get older. When I was younger I actively strove to be her: only drink beer at the bar, participate in all of the boys' humor, deride other women for appreciating ""girly"" things, not give a shit about anything, play video games, eat a lot of pizza, stay skinny. 

Now that I'm close to 30 it's basically down to play video games and eat a lot of pizza. But the fact is I never was the cool girl. My not caring about my SO going out without me isn't because I'm too cool for school, it's because I'm a depressive introverted mess who can't bare to be around people. My avoiding romantic comedies and movies like The Notebook wasn't because I didn't think there was any merit, it was because I was afraid I would be treated like a girl by my mostly-male friend group and in particular my boyfriend who really held the whole ""cool girl"" thing on a pedestal. 

And that, I think, is where the whole ""cool girl"" comes from in the first place: self defense. We see the way our guy friends talk about other girls and think *fuck, I don't want that.*"
"Generally I‚Äôm pretty left. I wouldn‚Äôt want to date someone who was racist, sexist or homophobic. "
"Ok, storytime!

On our fifth date, my (now) husband took me out to eat and meet some of his friends, then we went back to his place and I was spending the night there for the FIRST TIME EVER. 

I had like, super prepped to be sexy and beautiful and hairless and smelling good, all the things ya know, that you do for sexy time, and we have sex for the first time ever. It‚Äôs amazing, we get exhausted and go to bed.

Cue me, waking up in the middle of the night to the worst pain of my life. Horrible, gut wrenching, and feels like FOOD POISONING. He lived in a loftspace and he only bathroom was like 10 ft from the bed, you could hear everything!!!

I have to run for it (totally naked, I might add) and spend the next hour puking/pooping uncontrollably, crying, and feeling humiliated. He‚Äôs knocking on the door asking if I need anything and am I ok, I‚Äôm dying inside and figured it was the end of seeing him, I was so embarrassed. 

After I am empty of all fluids in my body, I brush my teeth and jumped in the shower and scrubbed down with ALL the soap to feel clean again. I still was feeling awful, and too weak to drive home. 
I open the bathroom door and crawl back into bed, not knowing what else to do. He starts puttering around at 4am, getting me water and a cool towel for my head, and checking in and calling a clinic and being wonderful.

Then he crawls back into bed and says he‚Äôll stay home from work to get me to said clinic when it opens in an hour.... and then he starts kissing on my neck haha! Like, how can you find me sexy after the sounds you just heard, dude????? And then... yep, we had sex before we went to the clinic hahaha

It was the sweetest most weird moment, and fast tracked out intimacy level in a way nothing else could do. He showed me what a caretaker and thoughtful person he was, and I knew I had a good one :)

And that‚Äôs also my only foodpoisoning sex story haha
"
Just checking you're not actually a spooky ghost.
"A no is a no. If your SO doesn't accept your no and put pressure on you, s/he's being selfish, inconsiderate and disrespectful to you. Some people would like to use negative names about you standing up for yourself like uptight, a prude.. it's so they can convince you to do what you don't want but they want. Don't accept that shit. "
"I keep reading 'every woman squirts' in the tune of REM's 'Everybody Hurts' gah. That aside, yes it is insane. He probably based his knowledge of sex on porn. "
Sounds like a woman not being into fucking dogs is a dealbreaker for him.... That‚Äôs a bit of a crazy fetish that maybe 1% or less of the female population would be into.
"Because of that quote, I was finally able to say I loved myself this morning for the first time, honestly, in all of my life."
"Zero foreplay and then zero leadup needed for anal sex. I'm all for porn but I worry about boys growing up thinking that *this* is what sex is like, just pounding away until you turn her over and stick it in the other hole. "
"She just turned 32 and she made the decision when she was 23 so I doubt it. Fake it til you make it should be literal. Probably not  a good idea if you never can make it. Treating others better has impacted her outlook and become her fulfillment now, she just had to suppress the shittiness until her attitude adjusted. "
Asos is good quality and has a range of prices. Many bloggers I follow shop there so I knew it had to be decent and good! Lol. It's great!
"39 here. I can't think of a single thing I miss about my 20s. That was the decade where my depression was horrible, my physical health was horrible, I was constantly stressed financially, what little love life I had was not good. 

Number 1 thing I wish I would have done was get into some quality therapy for my depression sooner so that I could get a better handle on it.  "
"Gross ü§Æ 

I overheard a dude the other night telling his Asian date all about his ‚Äúobviously Korean‚Äù waitress at a Chinese restaurant and how much he loved japan...dude...just have a NORMAL FUCKING CONVERSATION with her!!!! 

Being a racist isn‚Äôt a fetish, it‚Äôs just being a dumbass racist.
"
"Penetration is the only way I can orgasm, so either PIV or fingering. I have NEVER finished through oral, which is super disappointing because I constantly wonder what other women feel or experience.  

But, I love that I can orgasm from PIV because I can orgasm at the same time as my partner and it feels so intimate. Makes sex so much better just having that connection."
"To me, it's an entirely foreign way of thinking. If a woman isn't enthusiastically participating, then what's the thrill of sex? I'd rather masturbate than be with someone who wasn't entirely into it. If I'm getting mixed signals, I'm backing off and not pushing through. If you can't read yes/no then you should defer to no.

I understand that it can be off-putting or confusing to a guy to need to be the initiator with some women - although I admit that it's confusing because I come from a liberal area where women initiate all the time. But I can't understand how anyone can read this article, put themselves in his shoes and come off feeling like she potentially was confusing. Even if he wasn't picking up on her non-verbal cues *she even told him* she felt forced, when he kept asking for sex she said ""next time"" instead. He acknowledged he made her uncomfortable, said he would back off, and then escalated once again. It reads like a constant tug of war, not an enthusiastic sexual encounter. 
"
"Omg, possessiveness. I went out to a casual lunch with a guy and I bought my own food. He asked why didn't I let him pay for it and I said it was because I wanted to pay for it myself. I only drink water so I got a water cup (which is usually free at most food places) he said ""you don't want a drink? I told him I only drink water. So after I get my food and go to our table, he brings me a large cup that was empty. He smiled and said ""here I bought you a drink (as in he paid for the drink and gave me the cup to fill it up). I told him I only drink water and he bought me something anyway AFTER I said I wanna pay for my own stuff. And he spent the rest of the lunch date trying to offer me bites of his food saying not to be shy after I told him numerous times that I don't want any of his food. Do not date someone who doesn't take no for an answer or blatantly ignores your boundaries. "
"The dude who wanted me to bake his semen into a cake.

After my WTF reaction he changed it to, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you squirt and then you can bake THOSE juices into a cake!‚Äù

Bonus points: this was after we‚Äôd broken up. "
"I've always thought that was why he's still single. A guy that hot should be pulling in women left and right and...nothing. He has never posted a pic of himself with a woman, never changed his relationship status, never even talks about dating. I don't find it terrifying and all these years later, I find it really Sad and depressing. To have a desire you can't control but you know is so socially unacceptable you won't even attempt to find love with another human is really sad and depressing. I think that's why I never deleted him. I wanted him to know I might not be into that but I still accept him, as a Person, who has a real problem and can't help himself and is forever alone because of it. "
Not close but we get along.
I gained 16 pounds during the first 6 months living with my boyfriend. I'm really upset that I let this happen and I have a heavy family so I know this is just the beginning of a slippery slope. 
"&gt; But as soon as she said no, he backed off and called her a car.

No, he had her blow him, tried to fuck her a couple more times, and then when she started expressing anger at him (rather than just continuing to decline his advances) he finally called her a car."
"1. People are way too wrapped up in their own lives to care about or remember the embarrassing things you do.

"Senior data analyst at a large corporation.

I have a Masters in criminal justice and worked as a crime data analyst for a start-up. Start-up got acquired by the large corporation and some of the higher-ups from the first company got solid hiring manager positions in the new company.

A lot of the other start-up folks fled after the acquisition, but those of us who stayed have found ourselves promoted to more senior general analyst positions by these folks who know us from the previous company. For instance, the team I'm now on is run by one of the higher-ups from my old company, and of the 7 people on the team, 3 are also from the old company. We have some nepotism toward each other I guess - we help each other out.

Anyway, I make ""good money"" at 80k/yr and work from home so I make my own schedule, and while I get busy some days overall I'm probably only doing actual work 20-25 hours a week. Same goes for my coworkers with the same job title. Most of those work hours are spent doing things like half-listening to a conference call while I play The Sims."
"Oh, that's easy: I'd call my mother. After an hour of her I'll be more than ready to be vaporised."
"This is one of my favorite subreddits for many reasons. It can be funny, it's insightful and interesting. I've learned a lot about dating, grooming, what women look for when they come over to your place, etc.

Most importantly,  it caused me to switch to a bathroom waste basket with a lid."
"Being afraid to go places alone or feeling like I have to constantly be on guard. Being afraid to travel alone. Feeling like I have to do twice the work to get half the respect a man does for the same job. Having my thoughts or opinions dismissed because it's assumed I'm being too emotional. Not being as naturally physically strong, knowing that any man could easily overpower me. "
"I have Resting Bitch Face, but I also have Active Terrible Personality too and I think that drives people away more than my face does. "
"Like other users have said, I think I've been guilty of engaging in unintentional behavior that isn't ok. Nothing egregious, but this sub has made me more conscious about the things I might say. I like to check it regularly to see what a woman's perspective might be in regards to current social issues, like the recent sexual assault scandals in Hollywood. 

Also, my skin is so much better thanks to all of you. I've never had bad skin, so it was always kind of an afterthought. I've stumbled upon some skin care threads and taken the advice posted. I hangout with a bunch of dude-bros, and even they have noticed lol."
Pharmacist here! I actually got a lady the other day looking for one for her elderly mother. I told her not to get it. I don't even think I told her where they were. It amazing how many products we sell that I have to say nah that product at best doesn't work at worst is bad for you. 
This would probably turn me on. 
"Someone paid her to end all her Reddit comments with ""but that wasn't the worst thing I've done for money."""
"I like to see how they handle themselves in stressful situations. If they don't keep a level head and start freaking out, I know I'm not going to feel safe around them.

Saw a guy slam his car door so hard after being stuck in traffic (so he was late for our date) and then punch his window so hard that he cracked it. Got a great view from inside the restaurant we were meeting up in and I don't think he ever found out that I saw.

Needless to say, no second date."
"My husband is very attractive. There aren't really huge downsides to it.

It was kind of funny though when we got married, I spent literally two thousand dollars and hours of time with my dress, makeup, hair, etc, then whenever people see the pictures, they immediately compliment him in his rental suit."
"A few years ago, my depression was the worst it ever was. I couldn't get out of bed for longer than a few minutes to use the bathroom once or twice a day. I couldn't take care of myself.

A few times a week, my boyfriend at the time (now fianc√©) would lift me out of bed and put me on the couch and wrap a blanket around me. Then he would change the bedsheets, clean up the room and open the windows to air it. Then he would bring me into the bathroom and wash me, wash my hair, blow dry it, paint my nails and give me a fresh pair of pyjamas to change into.

He would carry me back to bed and let me sleep or else he would lie with me in silence or he would talk to me if I felt up to it. He never made me feel guilty. He never tried ""tough love"" or told me to just snap out of it. He asked me what I needed, I told him, and he gave it to me.

I'm feeling a lot better now, but still have severe body image issues. He leaves little notes on the mirror saying ""You are breathtaking"", ""You are beautiful just how you are"", ""Your body is the most incredibly beautiful thing I have ever seen.""

I love him."
"""Bro ur skin is glowy af. You look mad refreshed, bro."""
"Before I met my ex I went to a couple local concerts with friends every month. In the two years I dated him I only went to two concerts, both with him, because he didn't like the thought of what I ""might get up to"" if I saw a band without him."

"Yeah, it was kinda scary at times. I originally tried to take a break from him, but he knew my schedule so he'd just show up wherever I was. Definitely horror movie-esque."
"Seriously. 

I gifted my boyfriend a whole line of aveda facial care products to try out when we first started dating. (I‚Äôve been using their stuff and some other fancy goods for decades) 

He had dry skin, irritation on his face from shaving, and some acne, on top of dealing with psoriasis on his scalp. 

One day he commented on a zit and some dry skin on his face (because he was embarrassed and worried I would think it was gross). I said ‚ÄúI love you no matter what‚Äù, but I asked him to tell me about his skin care routine and he looked at me like... ‚Äúuh... I shave...?‚Äù 

I basically said, ‚Äúbabe, I don‚Äôt care about the psoriasis, but if the skin on your your face is troubling you let‚Äôs see what works.‚Äù 

Now he calls the aveda stuff ‚ÄòAthelas‚Äô and ‚Äòelf jiz‚Äô (because it smells medicinal, and he‚Äôs a huge Tolkien nerd)- and, because using their products for just two weeks cleared up his face, and solved his dry skin. 

I mean... Patrick Bateman may have been a total psychopath- but he understood the importance on skincare."
Always. My partner is FTM so I have definitely seen changes since starting hormone treatment 6 months ago but I can honestly say that I have never been more attracted to him. His body is in limbo but he will always be the sexiest human in existence to me. 9 year anniversary coming up soon:-)
At that point is no longer a kink. It's a job. There are legit adult care-giver roles out there.
"Not me. My granddaughter.  Played a lot with a boy who visited his grandfather that lived near them.  He declared his love for her when he was 7 years old.  They ran into each other at a football game in high school.  Instant attraction.  He told her that he had been waiting all these years to see her again. They are still together and plan on getting married after college.  She's an artist, he's a farmer.  What a story. "
"i think militant-anyone is just trying to quench their own desires by trying to resist so much out loud. the women i've known who have stayed childfree don't scream it out, don't call pregnant/mothering women or children slurs, etc."

"&gt; I like to think of myself as my best friend.

I do this, too. It's a running joke between my SO and I that we both like to go spend time with our friends - which for him means actually doing that and for me means having some wonderful alone time in the house. "
"Libertarians in the U.S. are barely distinguishable from Republicans. Even the ones who are pretty liberal are still too conservative for me, especially on issues like guns. And the unrealistic part of it is also a huge turn off.

"My husband is so fucking out of my league it's ridiculous. Doesn't help that his ex looks like Aldi brand Demi Lovato (who I secretly loathe as a result). He's also a total social butterfly who can be comfortable with anyone despite being introverted like me, while I'm very awkward and Invisible. I'm an INCREDIBLY insecure person so I wind up anxious and hating myself most of the time. I compare myself very negatively to nearly any other girl you put in front of me. I know I need to fix it but it's hard. I know he married me, voluntarily, because he wanted to... but I'm always terrified he'll go find someone better because he could do so with ease. I don't deserve him.  

Edit: Big thanks to the random internet stranger who decided to PM me saying he's cheating with someone way hotter and is sick of dating a ""fat lump"". It's bullshit but a panic attack at work is just the thing I needed today. "
"A fuck buddy once called me over to stand in the corner of his room and watch while he stood over a young girl on his bed and pissed all over her. 

I never fucked the guy after that. "
"Well, he liked it and he found some other people who liked being choked out.  Not to my taste, but he took my ""no"" in stride and didn't push it.  He was a very respectful sadist."
"Honestly if they disagree with my opinions I'm willing to put up with it if there's a genuine connection. I'm happier with people who don't agree with everything I like. The problem is if they make everything about politics and turn anygiven conversation into a political one, I'm out. Even if they agree with my political beliefs and all they talk about is politics i dont like it. I don't talk about politics with anyone else but a few select people. It's good to have a poltical opinion, but to discuss about politics 24/7 makes any person undatable."
"I don't give a fuck about what people say or think about me, or if others like me or not. I live for me, and therefore I take good care of myself in every aspect. Also, I understand that I have flaws, and failures, but instead of putting myself down for it, I try to learn from these obstacles. One more thing: I never EVER compare myself to others, or compete with other women. "
Proof it's needed.
"Self-denial is a hell of a thing. And if you've never experienced actual sexual fulfillment, you can convince yourself that what you're experiencing *is* fulfilling. It's only when you are jarred out of your frame of reference that you realize how much you've been lying to yourself. "
Yep. I‚Äôm so glad my SO just said one day how he doesn‚Äôt understand why abortion is a political issue in the US because it‚Äôs clearly a women‚Äôs choice. He was also like ‚Äúwhy are they alright with bombing loads of people but go crazy about saving some unborn fetuses?‚Äù I had hearteyes at that moment. 
"Shoot, I took women's libido pills when I was 21 that caused lactation (It was VERY unexpected). I'm glad I was dating someone who was super into it, and all of the men I've told have really enjoyed it thus far.

"Whatever me and my partner feel like, because sex isn't an obligation and shouldn't be."
Yes.
The documentary Miss-Representation touches on the shocking amount of time and money women spend to look good. Would totally recommend watching it!  
"Men are so dramatic. 

And if you don't set rules early, they'll treat you like you're their mother. "
"I don't think I realised how hard some people actually hate women and feel victimised by them just living their lives. I mean I knew sexism existed but reddit is the first time I was introduced to ideas like I'm just an evil whore by nature. 

And the upvoting is really disheartening. I mean like, revenge stories where the guy is talking about his ex who was a ""bitch"", he does something horrible and antisocial, and gets hundreds of up votes and kudos because they just take his word for it she was in the wrong, even though he gives no examples of her bad behaviour at all."
I know someone who told me it was medically necessary to douche your vagina
"I was going to say that I also was an ass when I was younger, but in the sense that I nearly succumbed to incel/red pill-type thinking when I was frustrated about being socially awkward. I wish I could have realized sooner that it's not easy for women, either, and that everyone has to expend effort to make friends and form romantic relationships."
"&gt; I thought I was fat, I wasn't.

Absolutely. At every stage of my life I thought I was fat, and now that I've had a kid I'm like ""damn I was hot before"". And ten years from now l will probably think the same of my current body."
Opera *not* Oprah!
"I‚Äôll add jealousy towards anyone/anything. An ex was jealous of my dog and would often complain that I was more affectionate towards the dog than him.    
Also when they tell you others were talking bad about you, they‚Äôll tell you what exactly (‚Äúthey said you were fat,‚Äù ‚Äúthey said you‚Äôre a bitch‚Äù). They also lie about the most minute and pointless things. I forgot to mention: look at their social circles. They have shit friends? Think about that. You‚Äôre not looking at their friends through the rose colored glasses you‚Äôre seeing your relationship. Said ex was always arguing with his friends and I didn‚Äôt like ANY of them. Shit people hang out with shit people. "
"Similarly, I hate how anal seems to be in almost every porn. Anal is not for everyone, but judging by how ubiquitous it is you'd think it was a default assumption for standard sex (like a standard sex session goes 1. blowjob for 10 minutes, 2. optional cunnilingus for 10 seconds using only the tip of your tongue, 3. vaginal sex without foreplay, 4. anal, 5. finish on her face). Because of porn, a lot of guys are coming into adulthood just *assuming* all women are willing to do it and will enjoy it. "
"This happened during 2008-10 so my memory is a bit fuzzy (THANK GOD)

I was in middle school or highschool. We met through some friends in a video game I played. We weren't dating, but we talked on Skype often and I got to know him... a little too well.

I found out he was essentially an adult baby (paraphilic infantilism if you want the fancy word). He got off to looking at cartoon porn of people, mainly childlike characters in full diapers. 
His preffered form of sexual roleplay is pretending he's a baby who needs changing..etc (thankfully he explained this and I never had the opportunity to indulge this fantasy)
He was extremely into frilly things (which I absolutely despise), including frilly pink diapers, and he basically told me when he moves out of his parent's place, he's going to buy all that stuff for himself and dress up.

At first, I was very apathetic to his fetish. In fact, he basically made it a game/detective hunt for me to figure out his ""BIG SECRET""... and BOY did I figure it out.

It wasn't until after he started showing me all the porn and the frilly diapers that I cracked and basically blocked him, when he was offline, on all forms of social network (which was only Skype and the game we all played)

I should have listened to the rest of the guys when they all said he was weird... they really were trying to look out for me x.x"
"Least favorite: I‚Äôm expected to have it together at this point but I totally don‚Äôt 
Most favorite: I have the ability to do, go, and buy anything I want and answer to no one"
"I do this, but like a watered down version. Mostly it's because I FEEL different. It's hard to describe, but basically I'll wear black because I feel like wearing black and being powerful and strong for a few weeks, then one day I'll wake up and think, ""I'm in more of a green hippie mood,"" and just go with that. Basically I ride it out, I figure it doesn't hurt anyone so what's the problem? As I said, though, mine is pretty watered down. I treat the people I know the exact same way regardless of my ""phase""."

"I had this conservative old-ass white guy professor for Intro Soc last year, and one of his favorite things to rabble about was how some homeless person from some situation he never specified (likely an example from a right-wing broadcast) was caught turning down food because it was past the expiration date. Cue rabble about how back when he was a Marine they made them eat a lot worse than that and how entitled and blah blah blah, the usual.

When you donate money instead of whatever odd canned goods are in the back of your cupboard nobody has to turn down an outdated good because they can't afford any chance of tainted food, and that's one more talking point you take away from that guy, who throws a tantrum whenever the needy don't gratefully consume whatever trash he throws out for them.

He did touch upon one truth, though. I'm told that most homeless and needy find ready enough sources of food these days thanks to all the good work being done. It's medical supplies, especially things like pads, tampons, socks, all that other stuff, that's what's in short supply on the streets.

Your local food bank knows what it needs to put out there, and it probably changes from week to week. Even the best-advised goods donation can't account for that.

So +1 for letting money do money's job."
tanning beds
I don't. I avoid mirrors. I avoid going out. I've been told it's body dysmorphia. I've been told to not worry about looks but it's always the attractive people that say it.
"Exactly, I notice so often that myself and other people look at one part of ourselves and find it stupid unattractive. If you don‚Äôt have the most attractive face, change your hair, start working out. A nice body goes a long way towards self love and making other people think you look good. Plus in most cases, your body isn‚Äôt unattractive unless you‚Äôre super skinny or fat, but if you‚Äôre toned it‚Äôs almost impossible to have a bad body."
"I am pretty much every negative stereotype of a woman that exists (except I'm funny, so there!)  I'm very emotional, insecure, obsessed with my appearance (not in the sense that I love my looks, but that I'm afraid I'm not pretty enough and I worry about it).  I majored in a ""girly"" topic that I've never used in my career.  I'm afraid of being alone.  I don't know how to fix things.  I'm genuinely terrible at math.  I'm incredibly social.  I need constant validation that I'm pretty, smart, funny etc (this is super common with men too but it gets attributed to women more often.)  I'm jealous.  I have volatile moods.  I'm obsessed with babies and children.  I love cooking and other ""girly"" things.  I could shop for 10 hours and not get bored.  I'm obsessed with clothes.

About half of these things are because I'm mentally ill, but in a way I'm lucky that I'm a woman because people will just say I'm ""being a woman"" and leave it at that.  I feel like if I were a man, I'd be way worse off given my personality traits.  I'd probably be called a wimp, crazy, weird, etc. far more often.  "
"My parents did the same with me.  But when my brother did it, my mom gave the chores to me because ""you do it so much better.""

How do you get your eye to stop twitching?"
"If they get jealous of pets and children. 

Ex would get mad if I cuddled my cat when he was over because it was ""our time.""

Also got jealous of the kids I worked with. One kid would give me lots of hugs and he hated that. I understand not liking kids, but being jealous of a five year old is a bit weird. "
You don't. Occasionally there are some men who post here pretending to be women and it's usually just obvious because they speak in a way that's so over the top/a caricature of women that IMO it's easy to tell. 
"Making decisions with a second person in mind.  From little things to ‚Äúhey wanna grab drinks this weekend?‚Äù *crap did SO and I already have plans?* to big stuff like moving states for a promotion.  Your opinion isn‚Äôt the only one that matters anymore. And even if your opinions mostly are the same, you still have to stop and think about someone else whenever you make a decision.   

I have to say that it‚Äôs worth it, though. Moving across the country with my best friend and partner was infinitely more fun than going alone.  But the process of making the decision to do it was harder.   "
"I would always look closely at the way someone handled a difference of opinion about stuff like movies, music, books, etc. For example, I went on a date with a guy and we were talking about our favorite TV shows. I told him that mine was *Buffy,* and he decided to start watching it. I didn't care that he didn't like it - not everyone likes the same things. It did bother me that he made fun of me for liking it. If that's how he acted with a difference of opinion over something that really doesn't matter, then I can't imagine what he would have been like had we disagreed on something more important."
When he uses the whole bed as a work surface to sort the clean laundry and fold it. HNNNNG!
Opera Winfrey has made my night. lmao

"
My friends and I are pretty divided. Some saying it's sexual assault because any point when a partner checks out, you should just stop...others saying it's a bad sexual encounter but not necessarily assault because she didn't openly revoke consent, she just gave him mixed signals of discomfort. I personally see this as very grey. I don't believe Aziz meant to be malicious and probably got too into the mood to read the signs that she got cold feet. "
I married a man who 3 years later figured out he was gay 
The Office. 
"&gt; his thoughts weren't on Trump's overt calls for racism or sexism

That's a big issue to gloss over, maybe not for you and your family, but it is a huge warning sign for others."
this was really charming to read. you and your wife seem like really great people. 
"I‚Äôm extremely attracted to him, however he thinks he‚Äôs ugly and fat and hates when I compliment him. It makes things difficult."
"Couldn't agree more with the top point. My step-father was abusive towards my mother in private. In public?... he cared too much about his ""public image"" to not pay attention to how he was coming off to others. It usually manifested as polite, charming, understanding, and even forgiving personality.  If a waiter screwed up his order or something else didn't go his way he'd kindly brush it off and move on... But once he got home, my mother would be on the receiving end of all his frustrations."
"""Only.""

Jesus. "
"I don't see where she cuddled him, though. She didn't even sit next to him on the couch after she said no. This was right after she told him ""next time"" and he joked by giving her more alcohol, and kept moving her hand away from his dick when he was trying to place it there. After he was blocking her from moving and sticking his fingers down her throat. From that account:

Grace says she spent around five minutes in the bathroom, collecting herself in the mirror and splashing herself with water. Then she went back to Ansari. **He asked her if she was okay. ‚ÄúI said I don‚Äôt want to feel forced because then I‚Äôll hate you, and I‚Äôd rather not hate you,‚Äù she said.**

She told babe that at first, she was happy with how he reacted. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòOh, of course, it‚Äôs only fun if we‚Äôre both having fun.‚Äô The response was technically very sweet and acknowledging the fact that I was very uncomfortable. **Verbally, in that moment, he acknowledged that I needed to take it slow.** Then he said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs just chill over here on the couch.‚Äô‚Äù

This moment is particularly significant for Grace, because she thought that would be the end of the sexual encounter ‚Äî her remark about not wanting to feel ‚Äúforced‚Äù had added a verbal component to the clues she was trying to give him about her discomfort. When she sat down on the floor next to Ansari, who sat on the couch, she thought he might rub her back, or play with her hair ‚Äî something to calm her down.

Ansari instructed her to turn around. ‚ÄúHe sat back and pointed to his penis and motioned for me to go down on him. And I did. I think I just felt really pressured. It was literally the most unexpected thing I thought would happen at that moment because I told him I was uncomfortable.‚Äù"
"I went through something similar. I remember noticing that I was different around my abusive SO, but I was so young I didn't realize that was a problem. At one point, I told him I wanted to go to a party without him because ""I'm a different person when I'm with you, and I don't like that person as much."""
