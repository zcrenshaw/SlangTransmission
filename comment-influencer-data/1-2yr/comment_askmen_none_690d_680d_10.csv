I guess you gotta fuck your friend 😕
Are you descended from Vikings?
There will be hair everywhere.  Do not panic.  This is going to be a normal occurrence. 
"whatever is the opposite of

**I'd suck her dad's dick just to get a taste of the recipe**"
"I fall for women who need me to take care of them, when what I really want is a woman who can honestly take care of herself.  So I guess needy bitches is my type. "
This is your only warning
Lock your door.
I remember in high school a lady friend of mine started crying. She was british and listening to her lament about whatever it was in her accent made me melt. Soo british girls crying
"It's very nice to be with the most beautiful woman in the room, but when you get close to someone, you start to see the imperfections, no matter how conventionally attractive they are. Everyone is human. And that's reassuring to know."
"I dated a fitness instagram model type with 200k followers. Nice girl, but everything was about social media, constantly taking pics and checking her phone

Lots of weird problems around food, couldnt just relax. It was tough so i stopped seeing her"

"If you guys decide you want to buy new furniture, don't split the total cost of the furniture, split paying for the actual pieces of furniture. It makes dividing it up easier when you break up, because you just keep the stuff you paid for."
"""Hey. You should know that I've experienced a sexual assault in my past so I'd like to go slow moving forward. I really like you and I don't want you to misinterpret my shyness as disinterest."""
"I dated an ex model for about 6 months. There's no way I would have approached her, instead *she* gave me *her* number. She later told me guys never make a move, I guess because they would feel intimidated.

The only thing that really differed from dating someone less attractive (that is less attractive than model caliber) was the number of guys who would double take/stare at her in public. It sometimes seemed like everyone was doing it. She said she was used to it and it began around the time she turned 13!

She had some problems which ultimately ruined the relationship. She asked me to propose to her a month in and she was clearly a hypochondriac. When I broke it off she claimed she was pregnant. Fun times."

"When I am cunning from cowgirl, she does this thing where she slowly l, deeply grinds on my cock until Im don't while telling me what a good boy I am for filling her up and how nice it feels, then she squats over top and lets my cum drip out of her vagina onto my coco and then laps everything clean.

Instant reboner and round 2."
There's literally no other way. 
"I'm in to wholesome girls.  Good old fashioned modesty, no drugs and little drinking, etc etc etc.  Pretty normal on the surface of things but I'm kind of a metal head, long hair, tattoos, the t shirts, stretched ears, I've done my fair share of drugs and drinking.  People I know think it's weird that I date such wholesome women, but I can't help it, I just want to do wholesome shit like hold hands and walk around the lake and pick apples."
"I recommend having sex with your girlfriend instead, I don't think the wall would like it"
"* Make sure you distribute the burden of household chores equally

* realize that one of you is ""cleaner"" and that the other one is going to have to live up to that standard, not the other way around where the cleaner person lives down to the dirtier standard

* You share a space and can't really get away from each other so if you're not good at arguing yet, make sure you get there quickly "
Your girl bad af
"The best thing a girl can be in bed is enthusiastic, like it's turning her on to be with me, as much as it's turning me on to be with her.

That's really 90% of it right there.
 "
"I knew a man in Reno who had the kind of tendency to turn the other cheek when another did him harm that suggested his old man heard a lot of prayers at night. He was a casino wiseguy, same job I had, and he had 30 years on me easy. A mentor, an old-fashioned man from a lost age, really.

Until I saw him cross paths in an alley with the man who'd been caught with his wife. You could practically hear the Ennio Morricone music come up when he said through his teeth, ""you son of a bitch.""

Other guy was this young punk, thought the old dog was a pushover and that his wife was just the sort of candy-sweet MILF a young man could add to the notches on his bedpost.

Now, I don't know what drove the man's wife to cheat on him. Might just have been that the guy was playin' cards to make a living and leaving her by herself a bit too often.

But what I do know is that an old man's fury and a deceptive strength for throwing a younger man against a wall and pounding him like cheap steak makes for one hell of a scene.

And had anyone bothered to ask me, I'd tell 'em what I told the man over drinks:

""I ain't seen a damn thing."""
"They do the month and day backwards over there, it's fucking loopy."
"Former male janitor. No women complained about me being in the women's restroom to clean it. In fact, they would walk right past me even with the sign up and use the restroom as I was cleaning it like I didn't exist."
A handshake. Jesus... 😂😂😂
"She could silence an Italian restaurant by waking in, but was a  dead fish in bed, had a  personality like an oak tree, pretty much parroted Facebook opinions, and was anti anything fun. It was a good month, but I had to walk away "
"Go to a public campus with a sign that says ""Free Hugs"" and a buddy with a sign that says ""Deluxe Hugs $2.00"".

Saw a guy on campus with a free hugs sign, and he was quite popular in doing so."
"Well we ( female) have sometimes a male cleaning the locker room. He opens the door, asks if he can come in and if no-one is screaming no, he starts working. That easy. Doesn't personally bother me that much if I wear underwear and am not completely naked. But if it is without a warning , that would be unfair."
LOts of neins 
"Sounds like a reasonable request. Throw it at the bedroom wall, and see if it sticks.

 If it was me, I'd enjoy watching her get herself off. Alternatively, take the time to teach him how to get you off via masturbation. 

 When the woman cums first, it takes a lot of performance pressure off the guy to not cum too early. A lot more time enjoying the sensations and alot less time thinking of baseball stats. "
"I mean, not ashamed, but I'm hugely attracted to girls with tired eyes, like those permanent dark circles or slight bags that never go away. I honestly don't know what it is, but it is so damn attractive to me. Maybe it just gives the illusion of more depth..."
"Ask her if she was drunk last night. Ask her if she knows what she did. Tell her you are not interested and to not do it again.

By asking her if she was drunk you give her the opportunity to fess up and apologize before you tell her it was innapropriate. What you don't want is going hard at her from the get go, otherwise she might feel like the victim. "
Make sure to buy plenty of toilet paper. You'll go through it at least 3 times as fast. :)
"Call me a weirdo/get your downvote buttons read/unpopular opinion here/hate to be that guy, but I like boobs and butts."
She got the message. The situation is temporary. Just ride it out.
"Former single dad. I used to use the baby changing table in the ladies room all the time because the men’s rooms rarely had them. No one ever cared. Sometimes ladies would hold the door for me, and once on a really bad day, a nice other mom even offered to change him for me because I looked so distressed. Being a single dad with an infant was damn tough. "
"Just curious - was the word ""retard""?"
"In my head I like egalitarian minded, self reliant women.

But holy shit, nothing gets my dick hard like the super feminine girly girls. Bonus points if they come off super ""proper"""
"* Be prepared to completely re-evaluate your idea of what is clean, both for personal hygiene and for your space.
* Have a conversation about who is going to do what in the way of household chores. Who takes out the trash, who does the dishes, etc. Be prepared to revisit this if there is friction. Never assume it'll just pan out on its own.
* Realize that if one of you gets pissed at the other, you don't have ""your own"" space anymore, so you're going to need to establish what happens when one of you needs space. 
* Figure out who's paying for what in regards to bills. Make it as even as possible.
* Have clear boundaries set for anything you don't want her to touch / use. If you have weapons in the house, make sure she knows where they are. Preferably also make sure she knows how to use them, but if she can't / won't learn to your satisfaction, make sure she knows not to touch them. 
* If either or both of you have pets, be prepared for a rough time as the pet adapts to your girlfriend's presence (or to the move if it's hers). 
* Despite the above point about no longer having your own space, try to set things up such that you two can do your own thing in a separate space if you are liable to eventually get tired of one another."
"Smh do whatever u want with him, just make sure to say 'no homo' 3 times to cancel out any susness"
Especially that little one for the bathroom.
Maybe you should... You know.. Be gay? 
"Or just get high and walk in public, you'll feel like the world is watching... "
"I dated this model over the summer. She was gorgeous, smart, had her shit together, and I fell for her. She approached me at a cafe one day and we just hit it off. 

Overall, it was a lot of fun. Like others have said in this thread, it's nice having the most beautiful girl in the room by your side. However, there are cons. We would go to a bar and she would get hit on by multiple people. I wish she would have played it more ""smart"" but she really liked the attention. And that was something I couldn't get past. 

Majority of our conversations were centered around the attention guys gave her, proposals for sex etc. She also seemed to have a fairly unhealthy view of relationships and men from her past. She was a few years younger than me and at a stage in her life where it seemed like she was still trying to figure things out emotionally. 

At the end, I had to move out of the country due to work and we never kept in touch after. Hope she's doing well though!"
"You know the old saying ""no matter how hot she is someone somewhere is sick of dealing with her shit"". Looks fade but personality is forever. "
"Notice? Probably.

Care? Not one fucking bit.

If we're at the point where nudity is happening, I'm already sold."
Pro tip: Shave her back once a month
"You have THREE or even FOUR people outside of family who will ask you how you're doing and invite you to things???

I'd like to know how you pulled that off..."
"This is the greatest thread ever.  I wish every young girl could read this.  A thousand things women are insecure about, and there's someone who finds every one of them attractive.  Bravo AskMen!"
"That said, too: have an exit strategy, both together and for yourself. A little money put aside so that you can move out. As well as a plan and clear expectations as a couple about what this means about commitment, marriage, dealbreakers, etc. Don't just sleepwalk into it, and be able to break up if need be. "
It wasn't a very popular place. It was actually a  pizza joint. It was dominos.
"If you ever want to experience the double take/stare just go to a place where your ethnicity is super uncommon, I noticed it when I went to Japan as a child in a city with nearly no foreigners "
"Yes, we’re called “Italians”."
Well if you're both dating around then I don't get it. You're inferring this from how she responds to text messages? If you aren't interested in making her your priority why aren't you expecting the same from her...?
Sort by controversial to find the real answers.
"Remember the show community where Troy said he though PJ's were better than lingerie? Basically that. 
Lingerie is fun and all, but seeing a girl with a messy morning look in just a pj-bottoms and a normal shirt will never fail for me."
"i hate that i find the really annoying girly types attractive. you know em, the ones that have a latte every day, nails done seemingly twice a week, really girly and super egotistical yet self conscious, selfies all the time and obsessed with the likes and somehow is 25 but is always posting pictures in the middle of the weekday out and about. they are so fucking annoying, by and far the most annoying demographic on Earth, but shit they are so fucking sexy...."
"Penne or rotini, far more convenient than strands. Harder for them to clump and tangle together, easier to serve, easier to eat."
I always re-rack my weights. I consider it part of my workout. It really is a workout to have to re-rack lol.
"It is locked, and now a chair is barricading it. I'm more asking about the conversation I have to have with her."
"I will always remember this story from high school. We had an old principal who spoke softly and ill-often. He was the type of man who listens to people, really listens to people. That meant any time a delinquent or rabble rouser entered his office he had full capacity to understand the situation well beyond just the substance of the words. I never found myself crossing his threshold but this was known to everybody especially the staff. 

One day this one kid, who we will refer to as Donnie, ends up in his office for punching another kid’s lights out and giving him a bloody nose during gym. Of course Donnie ends up in the principal’s office and he is still in gym uniform. 

Now this kid thinks he’s the shit. He just knocked a guy and now he’s speaking to this soft-toned mild mannered principal. So what does Donnie do? He kicks up his feet and plants them squarely on the principal’s desk.  His gross, battered, freshly mud-trodden shoes are now resting on top of the principal’s desk. The principal politely but very directly asks the child to remove his shoes from atop his desk. 

“Shut the fuck up you old fuck.” says Donnie as bluntly and disrespectfully as you probably imagine it.

At this point the principal begins warning Donnie about effects his actions and how they will affect him later in life. Donnie zoning through his then cuts him off and says something along lines of “Here’s what I’m going to do you fuck. I’m going to walk out of here go home (Donnie drives to school.) and later today I’ll stop by and fuck that wife of yours.” Plot twist: the principal’s wife had died no more than 6 weeks ago. 

The principal, almost in a moment, gets up, picks up Donnie and pins him to a wall followed by just a maelstrom of anger and abhorrence. And I specifically use the word maelstrom because you could hear the sound of him rolling down the hallways like thunder. 

Donnie would later get an undisclosed jail sentence plus 3 days suspended. "
"Gardening. Gardening is fucking amazing. You plant stuff in the ground, and it grows into food. Plants are wonderful thing. Stop whatever you're doing now and plant things. Re-wild the planet. No point in ""dating"", that's what characters in sitcoms and Americans do. "
"I dated a TV personality for about 5 years once. She was beautiful, bubbly, smart, funny and had that ""it"" factor. Had everything going for her to make it in the business. Met her through work, helped her get exposure through a local public access station. Worked my ass off putting her through college for tv/radio broadcasting.  Helped her get a job in a major city market through contacts I had. Helped her move and supported her in every way that I could. 3 months after moving, she dumped me, broke my heart and changed the way I view relationships forever."
"I had a football coach in HS who was a marine in Afghanistan. Soft spoken, never yelled at practice. If he had a point to make, the boys respected him enough to heed him without the need for him to raise his voice. Great guy.

He got hit with an IED and fucked his arm up, got medically discharged. It's not like it's a gimpy arm like the dude from Scary Movie, but it has almost no strength, it's super sensitive, and super scarred. Didn't like people to touch it, even accidentally. One day before practice, a couple guys and I were talking with him when a couple freshmen decided to see what would happen if they came up behind him and grabbed it. Why? I dont know. Ive never seen a man more angry than him. He SCREAMED at them the whole practice, making them do grass drills, over and backs, shuttles, you name it.

I dont know if maybe he had a lot of mental issues in regards to his arm or not, or maybe if it was painful to touch. But it reminded me this guy is a marine who's seen and lived through battle, no matter how soft spoken he is."
"My girlfriend is a former model. She used to travel all over the world working shows everywhere. Eventually she transitioned to her own label which she sold off.

I'm not the best looking of guys. I don't really understand how it was that we got together. I did stop to help her when her car broke down, she invited me to a friends of hers braai (BBQ) and then to her bed.

We have had our ups and downs. Both of us had a tough time with jealousy and suspicion of each other - both of us have been cheated on in the past. I see the way that others - both male and female - look at her, and sometimes flirt with her. I know now that nothing will come of any of it. We have both helped each other mature and grow into the beautiful, annoying couple that we are today.

We celebrate our 10th anniversary on Sunday."
Doesn't matter what race she is as long as I find her attractive 
Big difference between a restroom and a locker room.
"Most of the men with controversial answers wont answer this question 'out loud'. That's the problem with asking difficult questions like this, you'll get answers from those who don't think that they're particularly controversial and those that try to be honest get downvoted to shit and probably never read. 

Say what you want, but I think you'll always get a skewed view of what people actually think when you ask difficult questions."
"My college roommates and I always talked about drinking on the roof like they did in Workaholics, but we never had a ladder. 

Now that I’m married, we were borrowing a ladder to put up some patio lights and convinced my wife to get up on the roof and have a beer. We FaceTime’d my roommates and bragged that I finally did it. Pretty solid convos reminiscing on old times. 

Plus it’s a pretty solid view up there! "
Ah the good ole Captain Sav-A-Hoe. I did the same when I was younger. 
"The US-americans I've met here seem to have a hell lot of more sex. My friends who have the so called FWB or ONSs seem to have them mstly with awkward women.

Beside that it seems as if everything is more “natural” here – people meet, like each other and eventually start a relationship."
"I dated a girl for a brief period of time that was model material. She dumped me because one of her guy friends ""spilled the beans on how much he loved her and he wanted to marry her"". 2 weeks later she contacts me back saying she made a mistake. Apparently she found out he was going to propose to her nearly right away and she wasn't ready to get married yet.

I helped her out of it and we started getting back together. 2 weeks after that; another one of her many guy friends did basically the same thing to her so she ditched me to be with him.

While we were really dating we had a conversation in where she didn't understand how people had a hard time meeting people and date. I see why she thought that.

People like her were used to having ""tastes of the month"" and get bored after."
"Just say ""I was wondering if you'd like to go out sometime?"""
My my an *italian* restaurant? 
"Honestly reading into the timing of text message responses is never a good idea. Some people first of all intentionally delay their responses, and other people are just busy. It sounds to me like you should figure out what you want from her, and then ask for it. Maybe the next time you go out with her."
"Its literally just because they're hot, everyone lets them get away with it. I fucking hate that I want to bang these girls. Can't stand the personality"
"I dated a b-level instagram person in the motorcycle community. It was very unpleasant.

- She was definitely addicted to social media. For example, she could check facebook, email, insta, snapchat, and whatsapp all in about 30 seconds. She would just repeat that loop furiously over and over and over. Then, when the movie ended, she'd tell me she didn't like it and all the characters were dumb.
- She was also *definitely* using it for an ego boost. She got sooooo crushed when other girls got more likes.
- She was allllllso definitely using it to farm a stable of orbiting dudes so she would always have a next in line and never have to be alone. 
- Going out with her was horrible. Random fucking dudes would always horn in on our dates. She'd give me the blank stare like, ""what gives? don't be insecure! I'm just chatting this guy up!"" and then they're exchanging shitloads of texts for the next few months.
- She definitely used her attractiveness to get motorcycle favors. Free passes. Dudes to fix her bike. You name it. They'd get soooo salty when I showed up too, ah the shenangigans.
- Many of her exes were still whipped on her. Uhh let's see. One guy would text her daily begging her to let him fly her to vegas. Another was plotting a vacation where they run away from it all together. Another wanted her to come to europe for another x rated photo shoot.
- If I complained about any of these things, I was being a jealous dick
- If any women noted her behavior, they were being jealous. Yes, even the ones whose boyfriends she was stealing
- If any other men noted this behavior, she tried to have her supporters fight the guy. 

Overall she was a slutty moron who also made me lose faith in my bro's. Seriously dudes. What the fuck. Is there none among us with a shred of honor?"
I am neither dating nor living life to its fullest
Biggest dream of mine is just driving on a highway at night with her sitting in the passenger seat. That idea has always been cool to me. I want that moment.
The hormone monstress from Big Mouth....
I forgot to add....no homo.
"I was more distressed in Thailand when the dude in there started giving me a shoulder rub, I got used to that too, he had good hands."
"Preface - I'm black. 

My friend and I were hanging out and joking around. I forgot what we were talking about, but the word ""feminazi"" came up and I kept using it, because it's a fun word to say.


I tell her as much, and she says I shouldn't use ""feminazi"" and that only women can, and I said that's stupid, it's just a word. She replied, ""I'm sure you can relate to there being word that only a certain group of people can use that others can't.""


Took me a second to understand, but when I did, I couldn't stop laughing."
"""Thank you for your time miss but I'm looking to bury my sick else where.""

 *extends hand*"
WTF I wish people would stop posting their creepy fetishes in this sub
I'd suck her son's dick just to taste the results?
What the fuck
"While I sympathize with you immensely OP, if you can't talk about it then I don't think you have any business pursuing romantic dating at this time.

After I left my abusive relationship I stayed single for over a year, as a personal choice, because dating when I hadn't come to terms with my own shit was difficult and emotionally taxing. 

Treat yo'self... to some me time and healing before worrying about pleasing other people in the dating game. "
"As a girl I think how you handled it was fine. You knew you weren’t attracted to her but still went out and got pizza with her, and a handshake tells me exactly where you stand on possible future hookups (aka not happening). I’d appreciate that in the long run because I wouldn’t waste my time trying. We tend to overthink everything and a handshake is a clear sign that you’re not interested. Sure, I’d be bummed that you didn’t want to hook up when that was our plan, but you handled it well. "
There is another way. 3some.
"Dude, tell me about it. Especially those hair clumps in the shower lol"
This is why i come to this sub.
"If you have 3-4 friends you can actually rely on, thats more than most people. Treasure them."
"We have male janitors in the womens locker room where I live, I see signs for it all the time outside of my gym too, seems like no biggie to me."
"If she's like many women I know, she will have been brought up to automatically take charge of the running of the household whether she wants to or not. If she is like this, don't just offer to help with chores and housework, make decisions about them together - managing a household is as difficult and stressful as actually doing the work. Its a load best shared. Be a part of the decision making process as well as the implementation."
"I go to the gym waaay too much. I'm more impressed by a dude thats like 200+ lbs and had like 6% bf than a cute skinny chick with no tone, boobs and a flat ass. I can appreciate the work the dude did and dedication while the chick just managed to have good genetics and not be fat."
Never make someone a priority when all you are to them is an option. 
Basically the part of the plot of almost every Seinfeld episode...Jerry dates a hotty that has some quirk or flaw that drives him nuts.
She was not smart and couldn’t stop talking.  Damn was she gorgeous tho
Everyone. I am attracted to everyone.  It's easy for me to find something in another person that is sexy or interesting or praiseworthy and I can pretty much run with that in any direction.
Lonely. Very very lonely. The only person I've got to talk to is 3 hours away and I only hear from him like once a month.
I can't help but like a small but noticeable scar on their face area.  
If your idea of a first date is burning down her village then you just might be...a viking
"This... You probably empty your trashcan bathroom once every couple months now? When she moves in, you'll have to empty it every week.

Not sure what women do in the bathroom, but they make a ton of trash in there."
"You young hard-ons like to boast ""I'm all out if fucks to give"" but you can't deal with a glimpse of my wrinkly ballsack.  Laughable, man.  Bury a few friends and watch a few  dreams sail over the horizon forever and then see if you care about who's wrapping a towel around their ass in a changing room.  

You're at the gym working on dem gainz, I'm there to *fight my daily battle in an inevitably losing war against decline and death.*  Mortal combat, you dig?  Doctor's orders and shit.  Your puerile latent homophobia isn't even on the waiting list to submit an application to enter the queue to be on my radar."
"Yeah, you have two options:

Look like a stuck up bitch, or have him follow you around like a lost puppy. At least, that's what /r/askmen will have you believe.

But there's a super secret third option. You can sit him down, in private, and say ""Hey Jim. You've made a couple comments and I wanted to ask you what you meant by them because I don't want you to get the wrong idea...""

Yeah it's gonna be embarrassing and he's gonna feel like an asshole, but it's better than letting it swing out of control or shuting him down on a brutal and public manner. You would be surprised how rational people are capable of being.

And if he keeps doing it, *then* you can shut him down in a brutal and public manner."
"I used to have a few lesbian friends and it was always great fun to hang out with them.  In recent years it seemed to me that many of them got more ""radical"" and aggressive even with each other. It wasn't so much fun anymore and hard to establish new contact. A very good friend of mine was forced to delete men from FB to prove her gayness."
"&gt; I'm not going all in on this girl and dating others, but I like her more than the others.

lol...come on now. "
"What do you mean?  Sex where you hold her up in the air and press her against the wall while fucking her?

As long as you're in good physical health, try it for a bit.  Or try holding her up against the wall without having sex with her.  You'll get a fairly good idea of how long you'll want to hold her up like that fairly quickly."
The one where she has sex with me.
"I'm going to go with being in control.  I can't tell you how much better it is when she shoves her hand on your chest and pushes you back so you fall on the bed/couch and then mounts you. But like the main commenter said, being enthusiastic."

"When a girl can become a bitch if needed on command. I'm not talking like the girls who are mean, pushy, and vindictive 24/7, they're awful. When a normally reserved girl can really turn on that angry ""don't fuck with me or else"" attitude, for the right reasons, it's super hot. My ex would let people walk all over her so it probably has something to do with that. "
"See I would be uncomfortable with this but equally as uncomfortable being the person to verbalize being uncomfortable to make it so I wasn't uncomfortable.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't."

I know the big hoop earrings scream red flags for some people but on certain women they're fucking hot. 
"Idk if its the ""need me to take care of them"" but i really dont mind clingy. Like i hate jealousy and expecting me to tend on them. But I'm protective so clingy is okay with me."

"Amen. If you're strong enough to lift the weight, surely you're strong enough to put it back where it came from."
"It's actually not as tiring as you think. Obviously not 15 mins of holding her up but there's plenty of support if she's leaning on the wall and has her legs around your waist for added support.

Or ignore what I said and fuck the wall instead"
"the same as in the netherlands and belgium.

in short, the girls are anti-social due to excessive smartphone usage, they've got unreasonably high standards even though they don't look that good themselves, they don't have hobbies or interests other than going out and school, no one knows how to dress themselves and they're all skinnyfat."

"&gt; Not sure what women do in the bathroom, but they make a ton of trash in there.

Tampons/pads, tissues/cotton balls used for removing makeup, hairball if she has long hair and doesn't want to shed everywhere... It adds up fast! I have to empty mine every two weeks or so."
So just to confirm. You are probably a pretty damn attractive dude.

"Not me but my best friend married a girl in a super rich family and they have adopted me as a pseudo-stepson as I have helped them move and been to a million pool parties at their house.  Her mom is super cool and texts me on holidays and birthdays just cause she is a nice rich older woman.  She explained it to me like this.  ""Kleemin if you went to Nicaragua or somewhere like that, where a US dollar is worth about 200 pesos would you even bat an eye if the waiter offered you another drink and in US currency it equaled .03 cents?  Would you feel your friends owed you for buying them that .03 cent drink? or that .12 cent entree?"" that really put it into perspective for me and now i just enjoy my $250 dollar gift cards in my Christmas card every year.

"If you're casually dating, she's clearly not your primary plan either.  Don't be a hypocrite.  If you want to be monogamous with her, risk it all, ask for that, and let the chips fall where they may.  If you don't, don't expect her to be."
"When I was in the military as a mechanic my supervisor/mentor was a very buff, wise, and calm guy. He always taught me work issues out instead of raging and it was just hard to picture him angry at all.

Until one day.... We were already working for 13hrs and a couple more to go. We were exhausted, hungry, and cold. I also remembered over hearing him talking to his now wife saying he can't make it.

And because I tried making a joke while working in order to cheer up everyone. I fucking break a crucial part of the air craft that can easily take 4+ hours to fix.

That dude's muscle grew twice their size, grabbed a huge 1/2"" snap-on ratchet and threw against the floor making it explode into pieces and sparks while he yelled ""FUCK!!"" On top of his lungs and stormed away. I was scared shit less, and yeah I got in trouble. "
Unless she's your gf you have nothing to be jealous about. So I'd get on with asking her out before someone locks that down.

"Let's see here. How do I describe this?

On the outside I'm a reasonably good looking, fit, 40 year old single guy who has an active social life, is set to retire early, and isn't usually wanting for the company of a woman.

On the inside I'm scared shitless of aging alone, because now my body has started to turn. I have a torn ACL, my vision and hearing may be going, and my keen intellect has lost a bit of the edge. Also, I appear to be 100% unlovable. I'm not sure if it's just because I'm broken, or maybe there just isn't anything to love. I can only attract women with serious, legitimate mental health issues, and even they have the common sense to leave after a while. 

Not really sure if I even have a future. "

"This is winner right here. My girlfriend is amazing and willing to to nearly whatever I were to suggest we try. She's fun and not closed minded. HOWEVER, I sometimes wish she would do this kind of thing on her own volition. Its just not the same when you ask. I feel like a dick because she's absolutely awesome about trying whatever, but I usually have to ask and I wish that didnt bother me."
"You're late mate, sorry."
"1) Communicate, communicate, communicate. Even if you may think the topic is petty or unimportant, **communicate.**

2) Never stop dating each other. Always go out on date nights, preferably once a week.

3) Split bills and chores 50/50. Sometimes it may be 60/40 or even 70/30, but that's with the understanding that it will go back to 50/50 soon enough.

4) You will have to make sacrifices of your time, energy, and privacy. In a healthy relationship, this goes both ways"

"If you have a high-school/childhood gf/sweetheart/etc., then it's nice and many couples are like that. 

Otherwise, people bond over interests/hobbies/etc. but r'ships are very straining in undergrad/grad school/university with so many people opting to intern or study abroad or study in different cities and all that.

For the new twitter/tinder generation, it's a shit-show just like in any other place. And as time is passing, the chances of finding a chick who wants to commit long-term to you (marriage/kids/etc.) are quite slim."

"You didn't ignore it.  You told her off, she ran away, and now your door is closed.

It's a little insane to me that the key to great sex that basically all people are looking for in a partner is someone that clearly indicates that they want sex and are enjoying it.
"Does he know for sure you are gay?

If so, I’d ask him if he is into guys, if he says yes, go in for the invite. 

If he doesn’t know you are gay, I’d tell him and let that stew for a bit if he seems unaffected by that info, use the same strategy as above. 

Anyone finding you attractive is a positive in my book and Personally I’d be flattered even though I’m straight and it wouldn’t affect my friendship t all, but I know there are a lot of homophobes out there so i may not have to most relatable reaction. "

Don't apologize, but also for the love of god don't use this as the platform to make one more try at getting her to feel differently than she does. That's ""nice guy"" failure mode. As it stands, there's no failure here at all, just differing feelings. Extract yourself with your dignity and hers both intact."

"Not the person you asked, but I always though calling/being called daddy in bed was super weird and I thought it was messed up how common it was...

Then I'm with this one girl I had a FWB situation with, and one time we are about to start our normal vanilla fooling around and she says ""Daddy, I want you to take control today""...

When the sex is her idea. It gets tiring and kills my confidence real fast when I'm the only on initiating.
"I'm certainly more cautious, guarded, calloused and less open. I've learned that in a time of need, my family and true friends are the ones that I can openly give my heart to, and trust with it. I've also excepted the fact that sometimes in life, you're simply a stepping stone in someone else's."

Nope. I knew a friend that wasn't particularly attractive and it worked for him. You do need to follow rules 2. Make sure you smell good and aren't gross or anything and it will probably work.

"I dated what I consider a 10 last year.  Everything was great on paper and we made a good looking couple.  That gets old fast though, you stop noticing or caring because it simply isn't important to your overall happiness unless you've got some problems.  I understood after a few months how people married to gorgeous celebrities end up cheating or breaking things off.  She didn't want to put as much work into the relationship, presumably after a lifetime of being pursued by men where she didn't have to.  In bed it was a mixed bag as well, very low effort on her behalf and not really meeting me in the middle.

So while it was cool to be admired by other guys for a bit, ultimately it didn't work out.  She was shocked when I broke things off but not in a good way, almost as if she thought she deserved to be the one doing it."
"Worked at a coffee shop with a dad in his 40s who was the kindest person I worked with. One day a customer started cussing at him for something stupid and he responded with a strong, but controlled voice “SHAME ON YOU. Shame. On. You. I tried to make you exactly what you want, and you think it is okay to cuss me out? No. That is not okay. I will remake your drink, or give you a refund, but I will do NOTHING until you apologize for disrespecting me.” She started to tear up, apologized, and he apologized for getting her drink wrong. "

"&gt; I generally found Germans to be very anti-social and closed off. They seem very against the idea of small talk or meeting new people at bars/clubs.

It's extremely interesting to hear the German perspective on this: The people I know who visited the states (mother, sister, an old teacher, a classmate) all reported the same: Especially near the East Coast everyone is super nice, talking to you as if you were friends for years – even salesmen in the supermarket. “Heeeey how are you!? How's your baby??“ or especially “I'll invite you for barbecue some time“ – „Sounds very good. When?” ⇒ irritated looks, because you took the smalltalk serious. 

I've trapped in that trap last year when I had a awesome weekend and good conversations with an american student last year – he didn't answer my messages afterwards. It's all fake, it's not true. I prefer if one shows me if he doesn't like me instead of playing these games."

"Basically this.

Tinder is a shitfest of epic proportions. Every other girl has some philosophical quote in her description, some highly red-flag-esque stuff like ""I behave like a little bitch haha"", next line ""I don't want one night stands.""

Okay, whatever. And the thing about their standards is also true. Holy shit, some of the women on there go into it thinking they are the hottest thing to walk the earth but no, they aren't but still want a guy who looks like a 10.

Can't say anything to the laid thing, cause I am not good looking."
"I'm not German, but I was in the Army and was stationed in Deutschland for about 18 months.

Honestly, I hated dating in Germany.  I generally found Germans to be very anti-social and closed off.  They seem very against the idea of small talk or meeting new people at bars/clubs.  When my friends and I went out in large cities, we almost always went to Irish pubs and hung out with people from Great Britain, not because of the English speaking aspect, but just because they were almost always way more chill and sociable.

One bizarre aspect of German dating, however, was that a lot of German women seem to be obsessed with American 'thug culture'.  A lot of black guys I knew in the Army loved Germany, because the more they dressed and acted 'street', the more female attention they got (though a lot of Germans I talked to said that this is considered to be trashy and low class)."

"There's probably many reasons but I suspect the key one is this:

Heterosexual men are conditioned to hit on all women
Heterosexual women are conditioned to not hit on men

Gay men don't hit on women by preference which means their relationship is mutually non-threatening and they can enjoy mostly platonic friendships.
Gay women are hit on by men and so relationships can't be so non-threatening."

"Oooh that reminds me, 10th grade I hate a World Hostory teacher who was the nicest and most chipper short pudgy guy in the world. History is my favorite subject so I enjoyed him thoroughly and talked to him a lot after class, so I knew him well. 

I had heard stories from upper classmen that he broke a desk with a kid still in it one time and I just found it hard to believe until some kid just left his study notes trampled on the floor. 

Apparently it insulted him so much that he decided to talk to us in a very low, serious tone and held up the sheet of paper and was like

""I spend my days working very hard to teach you kids and I print out these study guides with my own money, and you know what this makes me feel like,"" and with a thunderclap that Odin would be proud of he just screams ""THIS MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SHIT! THE WAY YOU TREAT ME IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE---""and I have no memory of the rest of the rant.

What kind of advice do you think the girl in that situation would receive?

"Added benefit, if it works out, you both have extra money set aside to do something fun with or to increase your financial stability as a couple!"
"The cooldown, after I finished and before I slipped out of her, was possibly the most intensely intimate feeling I'd ever had to that point. She said something to the effect of ""I love the way you feel inside me"", and I had never in my life seen a more powerful look of love in a girl's eyes.

To this day, that's my favorite part of sex, and one reason why I don't do casual hookups anymore. Whether she's on birth control (or had her tubes tied) or whether we're trying (directly or just ""if it happens"") for a kid, finishing inside a girl is an essential part of the experience and one I don't feel satisfied without."

Woman here but I used to have the same problem. Washing too much can make your face oilier because your stripping away what it needs and it’s trying to replace it. I use soap free washes (dermaveen) and during the day sometimes I use baby wipes with coconut oil in them. It cleans my face but doesn’t dry it out so much so it doesn’t produce too much oil.

"In college, I started dating a late-bloomer who was just starting to bloom, in a teenage rom-com sort of way where she finally found confidence and changed her hair and makeup and clothes and BAM! By the time we married, she was doing modelling while finishing school.

She's beautiful, in the ""average girl in Hollywood"" way rather than ""stands out among the pretty girls at Fashion Week Paris way."" She doesn't really notice that everyone looks at her all the time, because she's used to it, but all of her friends notice. She never really got hit on much, or catcalled; she has a very powerful presence that scares off most men and also keeps even moderately insecure women from being her friends.

It has always been a little bit fun to be out with her, especially when she's dressed to the nines, but honestly I've always been more in love with her *person* than her body and beauty. There's something about her that goes beyond the look. But it's always good for the ego to have a gorgeous girl on your arm.

I've never been worried about her. She's a very loyal person and thinks that guys who fall for her are funny. She's more attracted to personality than looks, and for looks prefers slender guys over buff ones, so I'm safe.

And now that we're 40, it's fun to see that she's stayed beautiful and youthful. (A couple of months ago a college girl at church thought she was late 20's.) We really enjoy each other and have stayed deeply in love."

"I don't entirely agree with:

&gt;* Have a conversation about who is going to do what in the way of household chores. Who takes out the trash, who does the dishes, etc. Be prepared to revisit this if there is friction. Never assume it'll just pan out on its own.

You kinda make it sound like ""I take the trash out, you do the dishes"" and so on thing... If I cook that doesn't mean that my woman needs to do the dishes. Or because I am a guy that I will always take the trash out. Isn't it simpler ""you see that trash can is full - you take it out on your way out"" or ""Hey don't worry, I'll do the dishes, you relax"" or ""I'm too tired to cook today, do you mind doing that?""? I mean it's just my opinion, but assigning tasks is just plain stupid. Sure, for example I cook in my relationship more and clean up more, but that doesn't mean that only I am the one who does that. It just comes up naturally from day to day communication. If I have busier day and my woman has a free day - most likely she will just clean up while I'll be out and I'll just clean up after cooking or when she will have a busier day and won't be home. 

Though sorry if I misunderstood your point. "

"Great advice here, but on the more serious side of things, I know you’re excited, but don’t start telling people yet. Miscarriage is SUPER common (20% of pregnancies abort in the first trimester). No one takes about it ever, but it really fucking sucks, and it’s 10x worse when you have to “untell” everyone you told. People don’t know how to react, and it’s really painful and weird for everyone involved.

Absolutely no announcements on Facebook yet, and honestly don’t tell anyone you wouldn’t be comfortable untelling.

And obviously not everyone has the means to spend large amounts of money on unforeseen veterinary emergencies. Please don't beat yourself up over this.

I'm on tinder and bumble, but they don't really do anything, it's just a numbers game/shotgun approach online. I'd like to meet someone organically and have a relationship, but I don't even know anyone I'd be interested in.

Ah well. I've lost weight, I'm starting to lift weights. I suppose I'll just keep improving myself and wasting time on tinder until I find someone good. I'm not happy about it, but it's the best option I have at the moment, as far as I can see. "

I'd avoid going over to his house, or he comes to yours and you start making out, maybe a little foreplay and then you have to stop him and explain. Just from his perspective it would make him feel just as uncomfortable, like something he was doing was causing you to have those feelings, or flashbacks etc... 

Just do it in a comfortable, calm setting and be honest with him, and he should be with you. "

You have to be straightforward. I suggested a possible wording in my first comment.

I practiced my speech many times in the mirror before talking to my now-husband about it. But at the end of the day you just have to psych yourself up and do it.

"I'm not sure what qualifies as ""model or very good looking women"". Hopefully every man thinks the woman he is dating is ""very good looking"". 

But I have dated a few women with legit modeling contracts that paid decent money and am engaged to a woman that makes side gig money by being paid to occasionally model but mostly to show up at events and parties as ""eye candy"".

There are not many common traits among them. Most were loyal, but one cheated. One was really into tarot and crystals, while another was devoutly atheist, but most were firmly, ""I don't care"". None of them were ""dumb blondes"", though a couple of them would act like it occasionally if it made their lives easier. Two of them were geniuses. One was really into cats, another loved dogs, another was terrified of animals... IDK.

There really isn't much commonality among my experiences with them. But if I had to think of one the only universal theme is other men hitting on them. 

Each had a collection of genuinely nice, decent dudes in their social circle that had gone through a thirsty phase in their relationship. Texted her a ton, asked her out one or more times, kept going in for awkward hugs, etc. They're just normal guys that made a pass and eventually moved on. I'm actually friends with a few of them. They're not the problem. 

The problem are the ones that don't tell you about their attempts. They try to be your friend then you later learn the things they told your gf when he got her alone for a second. 

And the worst are the people your gf is scared to tell you about because what happened was so inappropriate/shameful/disgusting/criminal.

One had a problem where her boss, an older married man, arranged for them to take a long business trip alone and told her they would save money ""by only using 1 room"". She was a shy, 100lb non-native English speaker scared of losing her job and work visa. And her boss was basically giving her a casual fyi that he planned to assault her. She was able to make a small inquiry to HR and quietly get it fixed. But he remained her boss and that wasn't his only attempt. That is the only story of hers I feel comfortable sharing out of sensitivity for her privacy. (She's a very private person.) But the things that woman has been through... suffice to say: people are the fucking worst.

Another girl received constant horrible rapey texts and photos from someone we both knew. It was so normal that she only told me about it when he once sent her texts while we were at the same dinner as him and he kept getting up to use ""the bathroom"". Each bathroom trip corresponded with more texts from an unknown number about what he going to do to her. We eventually got him to stop without needing to blow the whole thing up... He later asked for my help in getting him a job at my work!

Another has casually said a few times she no longer considers her body her property. ""It's like being unusually tall, some people comment and some people feel the right to touch you."" She began getting ""playfully"" groped in 8th grade. She said women and gays were the worst offenders because they felt they had a pass. But it can't be counted how many times a man has ""magically"" tripped or fallen into her Christina Hendricks-like chest. No pointing making a fuss, she said. If she got angry every time a man touched her or said something wrong to her, she'd spend her whole life protesting.

A lot of these stories probably don't seem too bad. But I'm also not including the worst instances because some were told in confidence and aren't mine to tell.

So I guess, the only universal theme is that it erodes your trust in other men."

"I was a late bloomer but started to peak around age 24 and started attracting incredibly hot women. Incredibly satisfying I cant express how awesome it has been these past few years when it comes to that but here is what I have learned - you can easily become so infatuated with how hot a girl is that you ignore the fact that she isn’t right for you. For example, I pretended to like certain music, foods, activities, because they were so hot but all these relationships or flings ended because of bad chemistry and incompatibility. I now am more able to look at a beautiful girls and think more about her personality and interests before making any moves. 

My advice if you want to get a hot girl:

Be a charming flirty smartass

....and obviously try to maximize your potential of being good-looking

"This was my experience dating a super hottie too. I started hating going to bars because it was like there was some sort of take a number system of douches trying to hit on her in front of me, all of them with their little ‘witty’ attempts at putting me down or trying to have one of their friends distract me, like I’m too stupid to see what’s going on.  And once they finally realized that she wasn’t leaving me for them, they leave and boom next guy up starts trying to run his shit game. It was exhausting "

"She probably has never had to make a move before, so she's used to the guys doing all the legwork. That's not that unusual. Since guys generally ask girls out first, the burden of planning tends to also fall on guys.

It also sounds like she's just a very passive person. Maybe she's shy or maybe she's just submissive. For all we know, she thinks she's boring and is afraid of having her ideas rejected. Either way, if that's her personality, you're probably going to need to be the leader."

"Kinda the same. Had a rather calm and patient gym coach of all things. One day he was kinda wrong place wrong time near a fight that broke out in the school and between him and another teacher (female) had to pull two angst filled teenagers off each other. Well the one in the hands of the lady quit fighting but the other guy was lashing out at everything around him and pushing the gym teacher a bit as well. The GT after being shoved particularly hard grabbed the kid, shoved him into a locker bank, and essentially growled 'its done. It's over. Are we in agreeeance that it's done?' and waited til the kid nodded before letting go.

The dents are probably still in those shitty lockers. Doubt they'll ever be replaced.  They were old even when I went through. "

In my past relationships I wasn't the best at arguing. When I would butt heads with a S.O. I would often just open my mouth and blurt out the first thing that came to my head which was usually somewhat hurtful or mildly shitty/criticizing. With this girl we don't butt heads too often but when we do I now try to stop and think about what I say before I open my mouth. If it's hurtful or shitty i sit on it and instead try to think what would be the most constructive way to resolve the situtation for the both of us without sounding like a total shithead. So i'm getting better at it but it definitely seems like a skill that would come in handy.
"I’m attracted to crazy. I don’t know why, but I really live a girl who is fucking bat shit insane. Thankfully I am smart enough to know this is NOT healthy and thus don’t allow myself to actually date/get with those types of girls."
What if we're the ones who're backwards and they're correct? 
"In the past, it was something I barely cared about at all.  I've dated virtually every race.  Black, Middle Eastern, Desi (Indian, Pakistan, and so on), East Asian, South East Asian, White, HIspanic, and the list goes on.  I myself am Korean/White.  I got lucky with height, and size.  I'm 6'2"", broad shouldered, but currently fat on a cut.  You may ask ""wtf does this have to do with the question"", I'll tell you.  I used to date Asian/South East Asian women.  The thing that slowly started to bug me, is the apathy they had for their fellow full Asian males.  90% of dates would have her saying ""I normally don't date Asians, but you're half and so tall/built (when I was at my leanest).  I like your nose, and shoulders"" blabalbla.  I took it as a compliment, but as I got older I realized she was basically saying ""I like you, cause you're white enough"".  That and ""Dating a full Asian guy is weird, it's like dating my brother"".  I've never once heard a woman of any other race say this.  It's just anecdotal, but I feel like overall Asian women hate on Asian males a lot... it sometimes almost feels like a Asian self-hate thing.  A ton date white guys, and for some reason they have this chip on their shoulder... as if they moved up in class by dating white and not Asian.  For those reasons, I tend to avoid dating them as of late.  Just my opinion.  Other than that, I'll date any other race."
"i don't even know anymore. i'm 25 and have never had a girlfriend. i have been so focused on myself and goals that i feel like i have put too much pressure on myself and missed out on a social/love life. with that said, i have gone out and done multiple approaches but my lack of experience ruins it most of the time. there have been multiple chances where i could have gotten dates, but i always mess up. like someone else mentioned though, sometimes i wonder if there is a girl like me out there thinking the same thing. i'm just so discouraged. life was easier when i didn't care, but now it's like i have a craving. sorry if i went off topic a little."
"“Oh, I’m sorry for bothering you”"
"At my gym nobody reracks at all. Except the older crowd who have been going their whole lives. The girls lift the small ones and place them randomly all over the place. Annoying but at least you can find it. 

A lot of the guys who go to mine are pretty young and there's a lot of groups that go together. A lot are skinny as fuck despite going for nearly a year, take selfies together and go in groups and crowd around one instrument/rack while seemingly lifting as little as possible with poor form while talking and taking so much time leave dumbells all over the place.

Sorry. I might be pissed. "
"There's no easy way to do it, but at least take some comfort that the genders aren't reversed. There's a little less social stigma that way. 

You need to convey your feelings on the matter, so I suggest you be direct about it so that he gets that it isn't an idle wish but an actual impediment to a healthy relationship. Say what you say here, that it's difficult for you to imagine continuing a relationship with someone who doesn't prioritize their health and to whom you are losing attraction. 

Be direct, but not cruel. His reaction will tell you a lot about the future of things. I doubt he's unaware of the development, but sometimes a healthy intervention can start a turnaround. "
Yup. This is it right here. Just ask.

"There will be times you need to put the baby down in a safe place and just walk away.  

I am a very calm person. Not much gets to me. But babies have this amazing ability to punch the lizard-brain part of your rage center with both fists and a foot at the same time. The lack of sleep, the way they use their ENTIRE body to fight you while they scream the most heartbreaking scream in the world WILL get to you eventually. 

Put the baby in their crib, step out, and take a moment for you to compose yourself. Baby may really ratchet up the screaming while you do but she's safe.  You will feel like the worst person in the world but this is GOOD parenting. Recognize your limit and don't try to power through. That's when accidents happen. No baby ever got hurt from crying. Lots have been hurt by a parent at their wits end. 

I know what you're thinking: I'm not a violent person. This could never happen to me.  It can. There is a level of frustration you've NEVER felt before that baby WILL trigger. I never ever hurt my kids, but I absolutely felt a strange rage spike now and then that I never felt before or since. It was weird. When it hits step aside. 

Beware of it happening in your wife as well. She will likely need a good cry when she steps away. Be gentle, her hormones will not level off for a good long while after pregnancy. 

Tip 2: happy children come from happy parents. It is VERY easy to sacrifice everything.   You have to for the first 10 weeks or so. Once you get through that you need to make sure you pay attention to your relationship with your wife. After 3 months of doing everything separate while the other rests or watches the baby so you can run errands you need to Stewart doing things together again. Go on dates, take time for yourselves. As far as free time consumption is concerned, babies are Apex predators. You have to work together to keep from becoming just 2 people working through something together"

"Short-term: Masturbate.

Long-term: While minor mismatches in sex drives aren't a big deal to compromise on, big differences in sex drive (ex: Daily vs 2-3x a month) are something that will probably lead to problems/possibly breaking up.

That said, it's always worth keeping in mind what's going on in your partners life. I know mine takes a big dive when I'm stressed, sleep-deprived, sick, etc, and I've observed similar things to be true in people I've dated."

"So yes, obviously there is a double standard but there are also some key differences that can be taken into account. In my mind, the key difference is safety. From reading OP's description of her and assuming OP is in reasonable shape she should pose no serious threat. Also, as the other guy pointed out, men rape more. They're physically both more aggressive and more powerful. Now that said, those are assumptions that people might make here and assumptions are problematic. So the question comes down to this: how *safe* does OP feel? Does he feel like she has the potential to attack him, and if so can he defend himself? The answer to those questions is important to how OP should respond."

That being said, a fight broke out in the library and one kid was promptly slammed through a table (library tables were heavy duty as shit). Nicest teacher ever who did it to.

Apparently the parents tried suing him but it was quickly thrown out because of the circumstances."
"I agree. When you’re all tired and don’t feel like moving, reracking all those weights suck. This is why I don’t leg press too often. "
"People also need to understand that the dating in europe the culture is very different. People don't walk up to strangers but usually are introduced by friends. Most of my friends date a girl that they have been introduced to, they did not just walk up to some random girl. Social circles are very important in most of europe, once you get in one you are fine."
Girls who don't actually like me. Yep.
This whole thread is like /r/totallynotserialkillers
Because you'd be surprised by the number of men who are threatened by toys or a woman preferring to masturbate versus their failed attempts at getting the woman off. 
"My ex used to randomly answer the door in various outfits. (Heels and thigh highs, just a lab coat, mini skirt with a tube top) I would walk in and smile and she would pin me against the wall the mintue I got in knee and start blowing me wuth barely more then a few words without me asking or evening mentioning anything. She would then give me a really sloppy wet blowjob while using her hand like an extention of her mouth so it was like I was always inside her mouth. She would get so enthusiastic during it that she would typically end up drooling on her self and playing and start playing with herself with her other hand. An incredibld petite woman. "
No kidding. He somehow got a reputation as a hard ass afterwards. 
"""So this is why people say they don't like condoms, damn."" I eventually found condoms that weren't as tight and numb feeling, but still, it's a big difference. Not one worth risking pregnancy/STDs for though."
One of my friends just had a smol human and we were trying to figure out what it's like to be a baby and figured the little one just sees the world as nipple/non-nipple and spent a couple minutes just voicing out its inner dialogue really dramatically. 
"Saying ""I love you""..."
"I just want them to want sex. That's it. We can work on the details and get better together. 

I go by ""don't ask, don't tell"" when it comes to their past. "
"I've got news for you, *everyone* has body image issues in one way or another, and the whole time you're hoping that I don't notice your self perceived flaws, I'm hoping that you don't notice mine.  "
Wanna take my girlfriend off my hands for the next 3-4 days or so?
"Wake up with morning sex with my girl

Shower with shower sex

Cook breakfast while my girl wears only a button down shirt of mine

Eat breakfast while hitting from my vape

We take my dog for a hike

Head home, change, and meet up with the boys for a round of golf, or a group motorcycle ride

Come back home and take an hour nap

Read for an hour

Play video games for a couple hours

Take the dog for a jog

Cook dinner

Eat dinner while hitting the vape

Watch a movie with my girl

Furious makeout session that causes us to stop watching the movie because we end up having sex while super high

Restart and finish the movie

Bedtime
"
Shit in your hand and throw it at the father of the bride to show dominance.
"Being a great dad is more than just being there or playing with the baby. You have to do half of the diaper changes, get up half of the time in the night with the baby, make sure you're doing your fair share of the household chores, and give your wife some much needed ""her"" time to decompress, even if all she does is nap. "
"Shoulders, collarbones, and backs of girls, specifically their spine. I would throw in neck, but I feel thats pretty normal"
"I make sure to improve myself everyday to prepare , I hope she will be impressed when she meets me, whoever that girl may be."
"I'd have thought it'd depend what form of feminism they're into.  There's a form of radical feminism called lesbian separatism..  which is a slightly terrifying form to say the least.  They believe stuff like this:

It should be noted though, that I don't think that the majority of lesbians believe in lesbian separatism...."
Coming from a southerner the south tends to be more religious so most people here male or female are more marriage minded than other parts of the country.
"4 squares of toilet paper per bathroom visit.  Like, how did he expect to enforce that?"
EGAD! I suppose you enjoy consensual sex in the missionary sex for the sole purpose of procreation as well!
"I feel like you're putting too high expectations on friendships.

An inner circle of friends, where you always have each other's back. You might hang out together just because. They're basically family.

A wider circle of friends that you hang out with and see now and again. Life is busy, you don't have much time for the wider circle, and they don't have much time for you too. You usualy see them at social events."
"For those of us who enjoy early-Gothic architecture, the arch adds a certain aesthetic."
"Wtf 

Why does she have access to everything of yours in the first place

And presumably you of hers

Knowing each and every detail and having access to accounts of each other's won't leave any room for privacy

As for her changing her phone password, that might just be out of being salty at you catching her logged into your accounts "
"I care way, way too much what people think and the idea that someone could think negatively of me freaks me out."
"&gt; My friend isn’t conventionally attractive and he thinks people value him less because he isn’t what society considers to be “handsome”. Probably a lot to do with his own insecurities, but they’re still very real.

He's actually correct and the sooner you're real with him and give him real world help instead of attempt to make him feel better with half-truths and platitudes, the sooner he'll get a handle on his life and actually feel better.

I'm talking to you because I was this guy from the age of 13-26. I was (am) a black nerd who wore giant coke bottle glasses, didn't pick up on social cues very well, and wore hand-me downs from *someone* the entire way from not only my older brother, but my mom's co-workers's sons. I went to *college courses* in ill-fitting clothes pre-faded by dozens of wash cycles. Saying, ""I would do you if the stars align (in a configuration that kills off every other man),"" in that weak form does *absolutely nothing* to his feelings of worthlessness. I know it did nothing for me.

He doesn't know what it means to be attractive and appealing without being a douche. It's disheartening, but people, especially women, would rather try to tame a tiger than paint stripes on a cat.

He needs a paradigm shift on how he understands dating and mating and it's going to take a lot more than just, ""you're handsome-ish, go for it!"" He needs to start approaching this like an adult and not a child who wants everyone to play by the rules he was told. He needs to deal with reality on reality's terms.

Instead tell him that those douche guys are more appealing, but only because these women are choosing what is most interesting from a mediocre lot in the grand scheme of things. Attractive women are typically inundated with safe and weak attempts at their attention, so only strong ones stand out. Attractive women have tons of people lining up to help them out if they so much as pout, many with ulterior motives. People who show who they are - even if it's douchey! - are seen in a positive light, because at least they can trust that person is really about what they say they are about instead of the hidden snake sycophants that lurk in their friend groups. These women want follow-through. They want someone who is engaging and interesting and relatable.

Appearances matter. He can whine all he wants, but if some gal had fucked up teeth and a missing hand, he would be less interested. People who work for theirs - it could be anything: money, fitness, status, appearance, style, expression - respect people who also work for their own and moreso if it's the same thing; that's called mutual interests and values.

Is he doing all that? Is he doing all he can to maximize what ***he*** can provide? Until then, he needs to focus on that. Focus on being presentable, exciting, engaging, relatable, and humorous. Follow up and follow through. Ask these women out, and take no with grace. Improve his fitness and his craft.

When he's on the path to maximizing what he can do, then we can talk about whatever these women are and are not appreciating. No, he will not have as much success as the chiseled six-foot six college quarterback. That doesn't mean he can't have success and be satisfied.

But if he doesn't look at himself as something worth investing in, no one else is going to be convinced otherwise."
U want sum fuk?
Painted that picture like a pro man 
"Your friend is sexist. Sexual harassment towards men is far more common than people want to realize; the difference is, like domestic violence against men, it is often overlooked or written off as ""funny"" or ""justified."""
"Gotta throw my vote out for penne. Small enough that surface tension helps them contain sauce, large enough to eat with a fork."
That's disgusting 
Yeah that's what I meant.  Thanks for advice
"You seem to be reading into her texting habits way too much. Some people are just busy. You probably aren't second option or backup. She probably just doesn't prioritize dating the same way you do. Maybe she is still shy to message you and over thinking what to say prevents her from responding right away.

Go out and do something. Enjoy some time with friends. Don't just sit there waiting for her. "
"Just so you know, you're wrong. ""Nacho chips"" are tortilla chips with at least cheese (of course you can add more).

The guy who invented them was called Ignacio, which in Mexico is shortened to Nacho as a nickname. His special tortilla chips were drizzled with cheese and jalapeños, thus ""Nacho's"" special chips, or nachos. "
"Sames. Got my shit together. Starting my business, masters degree, good place, but lonely as fuck. Single and 30. Fuck. "
"Agree. I find the mention of a double standard here a bit much - yes, women's nudity is protected more than men's, but let's not kid ourselves about the risks women face at the hands of men, too."
Kinda surprised this question doesn’t have a trademark AskMen flair yet ?
UuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhUhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"I think part of the reason why they were bothered at first is that many women don't know men's rooms don't have changing tables, so it seems strange you chose the women's room.

I mean, I assumed they did. It just makes sense that both parents should have that. So I would have been weirded out by a guy choosing to change his kid in the women's room because seems completely unnecessary. I only learned otherwise when seeing this repeatedly commented on this sub lead to me asking a male friend about it.

I'm glad no one had an issue with it after you explained the reason."
"Yeah, as a European, pretty much 80% of the discussions on dating on Reddit just don't apply where I live. It's such a weirdly alienating experience, reading all that when Americans on Reddit just tend to assume that their dating experience is universal to everywhere in the world (well, at least in other developed/liberal countries)."
All I'm saying is that there is nothing wrong with a bit of bush.
"I see you've met all my exes.

Tell me which was the hottest and which was the best in bed?"
Or she’s just busy
"Nein bedeutet nein, ja bedeutet ja, und anal bedeutet anal."
"Dude so much of that information was incorrect. Mushrooms last 4-6 hours, LSD lasts 10-12 hours, and it's quite possible to be completely normal and functional again within 15-20 minutes after using DMT. "
"Hey/What's up/How's your week going/etc. don't work well on tinder unless you're like smoking hot. 

Have a cute/funny bio and open with a goofy question like, ""If a pinata doesn't break, is it broken?"" or ""Do you think a hot dog counts as a sandwich?"" or ""If a rolling stone gathers no moss, how is the top of my ceiling fan so dusty?""

That's what works for me on tinder. But like I'm an average/wholesome ish looking who wants something serious. If you're 25 and messaging girls who are 22, idk if this same strategy works as well."
"That sucks. No one should lose friend this young. But it happens.

Everyone is going to deal with grief differently, so I can't really give you advice, beyond the general stuff; make sure you surround yourself with people who care about you, and share what you're feeling if that makes you comfortable. Remember the positives in your relationship with your friend, even if it hurts, and when it hurts, let it. Cry, or don't, but do what feels right, not what you think you should do or what you think the people around you think you should do. Take it easy with the drugs and alcohol until you've got this all under control, and just be prepared for this to sneak up you every so often. 

It gets better.

I can't tell you how long, but it gets better.

If you can't handle it, get help. Seriously.

Take care, fellow."
If she gave a shit about you she wouldn't put you in that position. If she doesn't want to date you and your feelings don't matter what exactly does she need you for? Doesn't sound to me like you need an excuse to cut contact.
The same should be expected of her. 
"I have said goodbye to monogamy three months ago (been in and out of relationships for 7 years) and have discovered I'm a psycho slut. So, thanks for this!"
However if you wanna get high in public and not feel paranoid i recommend mescaline.
She sounds like a real keeper.
