"She was venting to you about stress at work, and then you piled on about how you feel. That was not a good moment to criticize her with some bullshit. You make it sound like she is getting hit on at the club, but she was getting harassed at work. Maybe show some empathy and understanding for your wife instead of dumping out your purse and making her deal with your insecurity. Her reaction may be over the top, but pointing that out won't help you. You need to understand how she feels and understand your mistake here if you want to push through this.

Your wife is hot. She is going to get hit on. It doesn't matter if she works with celebrities or if she were a waitress or a nurse. Beautiful women get hit on at work all the time, and it isn't fun for them.

Apologize to her. She was talking to you for comfort and support, and instead you made her bad experience about your feelings. "
"One thing I would caution in trying to create a bond between them and your daughter is that they might have zero interest in your baby because well its a baby. They might think you believe just because they're women they would naturally bond with a baby which is also sexism they will have faced. Women are often delegated to babysitting duties when men are not expected to do the same even though they may have no natural affinity or interest in hanging out with babies. So, start slow and just tell them you want your daughter to model after them and let them choose the pace of relationship they want with your daughter. "
"Hey she decided that she's keeping the 8K engagement ring I bought her to ""cherish the memory"" so I'm sure she's enjoying some of those damn consequences. "
"&gt;We see them once a week regularly. 

Why?? It's nice to hang out with other couples but her husband can't be that amazing that you need to do this regularly. Don't shoot yourself in the foot. You can't change her, you probably can't afford to be rude back to her so the only thing you should do is back out far enough so you don't have to tolerate her presence unless it's a big event. "
"To be honest, him asking is not the problem, especially if he framed it like you said: asking you how you feel about it. You have been together for three years, it is not a bad time to hazard sharing with you some of his secret desires. I would personally shut it down, but some people are into a lot of things that I don't like, and it's fine to talk about it with your partner.

Again I stress that I do not mean pressuring your partner about your secret kinks, just putting it out in the open, as delicately as possible, and being willing to just drop it forever if it is not a mutual thing.

Now, the real problem is that he was disgusted and hurt when you mentioned the flip-side to his offer. He is free to like the one thing and not like the other, but if he can't even hear about it without getting hurt, why put you through the same process? In these things you can either be consistent or be a hypocrite. I am afraid that your boyfriend is a hypocrite.


"
"Do you have other friends you can talk to? Ideally *non* mutual friends, so you can focus on talking about your feelings with them without feeling like you're stealing potential emotional support from Reina? Can you, I dunno, talk to your mom or something? It sounds like what you desperately need here is someone to hug you and say to your face ""not wanting to have sex with someone is not a moral failing just because you care about that person, neither is not being able to be around someone because you're pining, this is not your fault or her fault but it sucks and it's okay to be upset."" 

Then, like, take some time to grieve the death of a long relationship? Eat some ice cream/pizza/Chinese takeout/mac&amp;cheese/whatever your preferred comfort food is. You should eventually go and make plans with other friends and try to cheer yourself up and move on with life and so on, but it's okay if you need to wallow a little first. You're only human. "

"No. He cannot sue you for getting an abortion. You should make a post in r/legaladvice to have this explained in greater detail, but the short answer is no. He can file a lawsuit, as anyone can for anything, but there's no chance it would go forward. "
"Omg. Thank you so much for putting this into words. I've been feeling like this for a while and didn't know how to articulate it. I feel that way about our dates - he doesn't plan anything, even free ones, because he doesn't have to ""win me over"" anymore. I once brought that up and he contested that committed couples shouldn't have to ""win over"" each other - they should be happy building a relationship. But *dates are important to me in building a relationship!!*

What would be an effective way to mention this (probably separately) to Steve? "
"She's willing to buy it though, that's even sadder."
"Get proof, send the emails to yourself, screenshots, whatever. It'll be helpful depending on your state for the divorce. Whenever you think about how he loves you and how you have a family, remind yourself that he betrayed you and your family to go back to an ex. Get therapy and tell them everything, pick up hobbies, block him when you're finally done with him. Find one good friend that you can lean on and spill the beans, let them tell you what you already know - he's a piece of shit and the less time you waste with him the better."
"Dude. This is an issue with your wife, not your MIL. Sure, your MIL sounds like a huge pain in the ass, but that wouldn't be a problem at all if you and your wife were on the same page."
"&gt;Do I accept this and let him go off on me? 

Fuck no.

&gt;Or let him get over it himself?

Hell yes.

NO HUMAN BEING has to be a dumping ground for the emotional shit produced by another human being.

If he wants to ""unload,"" he can go talk to a therapist and pay for the privilege.

"
"We're definitely missing some key pieces of information here, like ""why do you hate amy so much ?"" "" why does your husband like amy so much ?"" ""how long have they been friends?"" ""when and why did you two fall out?""

But all that's just because I'm incredibly nosy and want to know the juicy details.

Advicewise - it's hugely inappropriate for your husband (or anyone) to try and dictate to you who you can and can't be friends with. You are allowed to hate people and a good husband will simply hate them alongside you, because you're a team."
"As a server, if I notice someone not touching their food or enjoying it, I will ask them if the food is alright. If I ask more than once, I am alluding that I notice that you don't like it and am giving you a chance to speak up so I can have your meal remade by the kitchen the way it should be made. Because let's be honest, I legitimately want you to enjoy your meal and no one likes eating shit food that they paid for. The kitchen fucks up sometimes. And if the second meal still sucks, then I'm sorry but at least now you know the menu sucks. 

Also, surprise! I was also shy once. I would always hold my tongue and not inconvenient anyone. I will also (and probably still do) get upset when other people inconvenience others at my expense. Like my father, I used to lash out at these people. But I have learned that this is ABUSIVE. And I've seen how it affects my mom. Just because you are close to someone does not give you the right to treat them like shit but treat strangers like royalty. He does that because he knows you'll put up with it/won't leave him for it. That is, until you fight back and he realizes that what he's doing is not cool. 

And if anything, him contradicting your statement on the food probably made it really awkward for the server because it would've made it really awkward for me. But I agree that maybe he has anxiety as well."
Anti-depressants usually LOWER libido.
"Its also sounds like OP's dude is a fluke, all that talk of ""fitting in"" - to me that sounds like he was a one-off in his family. So... they might have average height kids, and it'll be HIS fault, not hers."
"At 13 weeks she asked if she could go public and you said ""give me a week"". Then you didn't do it. Then you said ""give me another"" week. Then you didn't do it. Then you said ""Give me more weeks"". You waited TWO MORE WEEKS and still didn't do it.

This was preventing your girlfriend from being public with her news the entire time. 

Thank God your girlfriend told them. I'm not convinced you ever would have. You need to take some ownership for your role in this. You have no spine, and you need to develop one rather quickly since you have a baby on the way.

What's done is done. Get over yourself and learn to stand up to your family. You're going to be a dad and you have bigger problems to worry about right now."
"Seriously! This guy has so blatantly been catfished. OP, call Catfish, expose this online troll for the 40 year old man with a beer belly that they really are, destroy your boyfriends fantasy then tell him to go fuck himself.


Or, just tell him to go fuck himself. But the first option feels better to me."
"He's a crappy boyfriend and he doesn't respect you. There is (probably) no case where comparing your current partner to an ex unfavorably is a good thing for your relationship. At worst he's doing it intentionally to lower your self esteem so you'll put up with him treating you like crap indefinitely. You're too good for him, he's just trying to make you think it's the other way around. Leave this dbag.  "
"She basically feels that you lied to her about Baltimore being safe. She's basically right.

You probably can't make this right, but if you can, it's only by moving away."
"Stop throwing evidence away. Collect, document and then go to the cops. E-mails can be investigated, so if you have a bunch of those, they might be able to link it to Nick. Lock down your social media, he's getting his information from somewhere. "
"1. He says he's going to kill you if you cheat on him.
2. He constantly accuses you of cheating on him.

All signs seem to point to he's going to kill you someday if you don't get far far away from him."
"I like the way this advice is written out in 3 clear phases OP. Leave whilst he is away and block him on social media emails and phone. Ensure your new address is kept secret. Alert your boss / family not to divulge the *tinest* bit of information about you.  

Good luck and come back to update us, stay safe above all.  "
From your replies it's starting to sound a bit like your anxiety is out of proportion to these situations. You may want to bring this up with your doctor. 
"Do what's best for yourself. If that's going, then go. Those who love you want you to be happy and to get to study what you want to study. "
"You are likely getting good advice.  A side thought: if you do end up changing your relationship with your wife I would keep that change away from your daughter.  The last thing she needs to feel is that it's her ""fault.""  If you have marital issues because of this, and I think you do, it is 100% not your daughters issue but I can almost guarantee she will feel like it is.  

So, you kept your exs cheating from your daughter and you were right to.  If things go south with your wife, keep the reasons why to yourself as well."
"So, there's two kinds of ""I don't care about doing this."" There's ""I don't care about doing this"", and ""I don't think I *can* do this, and if I tell myself it's because I don't care, it'll hurt less"".

If your girlfriend *really* doesn't care about losing weight... you guys should probably break up so you can each find someone with more mutual attraction.

If your girlfriend is trying not to care because she doesn't think it can happen... that's a different story.

So - if she doesn't think she can manage it...

Once again, there are some different possibilities.

1) She knows what she needs to do to lose weight, but she doesn't have the willpower to do it.

2) She doesn't know what she needs to do to lose weight, and thinks it's hopeless.

3) She *thinks* she knows what she needs to do to lose weight, she's *incorrect*, so what she's trying hasn't been working.

In case (1), you need to be extra supportive, and help her to find ways of accomplishing her goals.

In cases (2) and (3), you need to make sure she's *actually aware* of how healthy eating works - or at least the basics of portion sizes, calories, and different nutrients."
Yeah sounds like she doesn't really care as much about you as you do about her. Sorry dude. Maybe don't waste any hard earned cash on engagement and wedding gifts.
"I'm 38, totally sober, and I just tripped over the cat. "
Don't make any decisions until you've seen an actual genetic counselor who can explain what your risks actually are. All couples should get screened to see if they are carriers for hereditary conditions. 
Don't live in hypothetical land. You can always dream up something to be upset about. You took a cute comment and stretched it until it turned into something negative. But what's there to be upset about? You have a great relationship with a loving wife. Live in the truth of the moment and enjoy your life! Anything else is unfair to both of you. 
"Maybe he could have used some more ""delicate"" language, but I'll be honest I admire the hell out of his willingness to quietly yet pointedly confront a person who was acting ridiculously.  "

"&gt;I don't know what to do.

You break up with him. He did this on purpose to hurt you.

Never, **ever** stay with a person who can purposely hurt you for any reason.

Much less when they do it *without even telling you they were upset in the first place*.

Send him one text telling him never to contact you again, block everything, change locks as necessary, etc."
"No, no, no. This works if you guys are dirt poor and need to budget share a lot but this is not how adult vacations work beyond the poor student life work. Couples always get separate rooms for privacy and they get to choose their own itinerary. It's abysmal manners to barge into someone's vacation. I suspect your husband is asking her rather than her taking the initiative to force her way in because otherwise it would mean she's spectacularly lacking some IQ points. 

What your husband is doing would piss me off enough to plan a trip with my friends and not go with him at all.  "

"My husband had a co-worker like this. 

He'd answer ""yep"". 

The co-worker at first corrected him, telling my husband that he didn't ask a yes or no question. 

My husband responded ""oh"" and continued on his way. 

After a while the co-worker just got tired of not being heard and he was embarrassed that my husband was obviously not listening. 

So he stopped doing it. "
"Your BF has gone off the rails. Playing with poop is a HUGE red flag for severe mental illness. I am worried he might be a danger to you or himself.

"If she couldn't go to the party because she had work to do, you shouldn't have stayed at home and tried to stop her doing work. I often have work to do at home and it's so annoying when my SO is distracting me while I'm trying to just get it done.

Talk to her about how you feel. Over time though I think she'll begin to manage her time better and she'll work less at home. "
"Experiences with one guy are not promiscuous. Is that person near Fred's own age? Because my advice would differ if not. If he is I'd just encourage Fred to be safe and leave it alone. As for your gf, you can't stop her from talking to him about it, but stress that what he needs most right now is to know that he's still loved."
"OP, you said you were in an abusive relationship before him, and you had/have? serious mental health problems. This seems like a pattern, that you pick abusive men. Stay single for a long time and work on fixing yourself before you get into the next relationship. "

My sister (in her 60s) is still to this day, self conscious about her height because of the way she was teased/tortured/bullied by her classmates and our family. 

He doesn't sound abusive at all. Maybe a little excitable..."

"Yes, you report your mother to the police.

Without a police report, your credit card company won't replace the money. With a police report, you should be able to get the charges reversed.

"It sounds like more than this incompatibility being a problem it's a problem that he hasn't *accepted* this about you.  My partner is much more social than I am.  He loves doing big dinner and going to big parties.  He loves it even more when I come along.

But often, I don't.  I need time alone, I need peace and quiet.  And he gets that, and he accepts it, so he's never once said ""I'm so disappointed you're not coming.""  He's just said ""totally get that, I'll just let them know you had plans"" because I do have plans - plans to sit alone and read.

Obviously if it's an important event like a wedding or a birthday dinner I go.  And because I know he respects my choices not to go to social things, if he ever says to me ""I'd really appreciate it if you came,"" which he has done for some business-related social events, I go.  Because I know he wouldn't ask if it weren't important to him.  But we can only have that dynamic because he respects my decision to not go to less important things.

I'd sit down and have a serious talk with him about this.  "
Wow. Tell him to get over himself. You were not with him. What you did before him is not his business and should have zero impact on your relationship with him. Don't you feel bad for living your life whilst he was too scared to ask you out.

"This post gives me deja vu. I had a roommate who did this, (made a spare key without permission, bf would sit naked on couch, took up all the kitchen and fridge space, forbid me from bringing guests over, drove up utility bills). I told my leasing office. In my lease, you couldn't make a key without permission and guests were not allowed for more than three days. At this point, I'd just tell. She sounds like a child."
"Okay, so he's trying to guilt trip you for being suspicious after all of this, instead of comforting you or anything else. Is that the behavior of an innocent man? 

What would she stand to gain from falsely accusing him? It's pretty weird she knew where you lived and came to your door. Add all the things you do know together, and the cloud of suspicion is darkening over him, not her. Who just happens to have deleted all texts from their phone coincidentally after being accused of infidelity? 

You need to look into your finances, and all accounts he's given you access to. He's shady and I think she was being honest with you. 

"
"If they're ""really close,"" then how did your fiancé come to the conclusion that he shouldn't even bother to ask the cousin about being a groomsman because he might not come to the wedding? I just can't wrap my head around that concept. If the cousin is a great guy &amp; they have a good relationship, then why didn't the ""Hey, I would love for you to be a groomsman, but I understand if it's too expensive to travel here"" conversation get completely skipped over? I mean, it's going to be super awkward for your fiancé to go back now &amp; say, ""Oh, actually, we assumed you weren't even coming to the wedding, so I didn't ask you to be in the bridal party. Sorry dude.""

Also, if you do choose to include him, please don't throw in a last-minute bridesmaid to make numbers even. Being a bridesmaid is a time &amp; money commitment, so it's shitty to ask someone to fill in &amp; do it not because you initially wanted them standing with you but because you need an extra body to make the numbers even.

"&gt;If he takes ownership for not making better choices earlier and gives them room to feel angry or not want a relationship, and about how he doesn't want his daughter to go through that too, imo it's likely to be received better.

Seconded. OP comes off as very sincere. He still has to realize that he's essentially telling them, ""I didn't care that you were both treated like second-class citizens until I had a woman in my life that I care about- my own daughter!"" If he thinks through why he was ok with it for so long growing up, and really acknowledges how fucked up it is, and that it is wrong to perpetuate this, he stands a better chance of being heard as well. "
"&gt;I have been nothing but a good kid my whole life and the discrepancy between how I'm treated vs my sister makes this whole thing a LOT harder to swallow.

So you were the Scapegoat and your sister was the Golden Child.  I was in your position too, and I'm so sorry you're going through this.  You are definitely not alone ! 

Your mother is abusive, manipulative and controlling, and it's quite possible she has spread lies and abuse about you to your family.  If they choose to believe her over you, then you have no choice but to let them go as well.

Don't cave.  Don't give in to keep the peace.  Your mother is freaking out because *she has lost control* and that is just the worst thing ever to happen to a narcissist.  Keep ignoring until she decides to come to her senses, and even then, you'll have to keep a very arms-length and distant relationship with her so she can't reel you back in with her control and abuse.  

Go on your trip.  Show your tattoos proudly.  Have whatever relationship you want with your family, but set hard boundaries that you will not talk about your mother's issues or be blamed for her stress.  *She is choosing to abuse and control you* and *she is choosing to treat you like shit*.  None of this is your fault !  No matter how good you were as a kid, she's fundamentally broken as a human being and a parent, and is not capable of giving you the unconditional love you need and deserve.

Once you get back from your trip, I highly recommend therapy.  Also read the books ""Boundaries"" and ""Emotional Manipulation"", and check out /r/raisedbynarcissists.  You don't have the family you needed or deserved, but **that's not your fault**.  I'm sorry you're going through this and hope you have a great trip !"
"Uh I mean you both are in the wrong for letting something this simple escalate to a big fight.

But I would say that you're more in the wrong for not letting her try a tiny bite.  That's kind of petty.  Even though she said it sounded gross.  I can't imagine my wife asking to try something I made and me saying no.

Side note: is that ... any good?"
"I think she thinks he either does have a secret one, or he is afraid his other lovers will try to contact him on it, like if he's keeping it a secret from them that he has a girlfriend, they would see nothing wrong in saying hi on social media."
"I am a parent to a low functioning mentally disabled child, and I see a group home or some alternative in my future.

Like OP's gf I am divorced, and so this was ""baggage"" into any new relationship. I've since remarried, and am grateful that my husband (like OP a divorced childfree person) has accepted the situation, but it is very tough. My kid is hard to deal with at times, and definitely less interactive and affectionate with my spouse, which makes it harder still. It's one thing to put up with hardship and get some affection, harder to put up with it and have far less affection.

Once my kid reaches legal age of majority I would definitely consider an alternative to their being home. For now my ex won't consider a home or facility, so maybe that alternative becomes his house full time. 

How OP's girlfriend sees the future will play a part in what happens going forward. Will she consider a home for her son when he gets older? If yes, is OP able to deal with living with her son until then? They can be touchy subjects to broach, because if she hasn't considered the subject, it may sound like OP is trying to get rid of the son when all he's doing is sussing out the situation. And it may just all be a deal breaker to OP. I was lucky that it wasn't for my husband, but I wouldn't have blamed him either. I didn't have a choice in the situation, and given the choice I wouldn't want to be in it, to be quite frank. The amount of suck outweighs anything else."
"Exactly. Op mentions the trip is optional but IMO the fact that the boss handed out the tickets at the meeting without asking for availability means it's not optional at all. 

OP would be very foolish to miss the trip and not just because it will be fun but because 'deals are made on the golf course' and turning down the trip may affect her career or at the very least change her boss' perception of her. "
"&gt; no matter what they are.

Resentment, anger, disgust, etc., are also all feelings. Knowing what my parents went through in their divorce: love fades, love dies. Knowing what my mom and step dad are going through after almost 20 years together: love fades, love dies. All that's left are bitter, charred husks of feelings that once were.

It's not worth staying in a relationship for what used to be. If your house burned down, would you keep living in it because ""there used to be a house here"" and ""there's still some foundation and part of a wall! There's still some house here!"" "
"&gt;  Have an amazing 7y/o son who was a 'kinder surprise' born when I was 20. Hubby never wanted kids, but stayed with me (was his choice). 

It kind of sounds like they didn't intend to get married at that point, either.... Basically the husband has been sort of carrying his responsibility for an oops baby. Maybe OP and him would indeed not have any children at all if this hadn't happened. 

So yeah, they should probably divorce, because forcing more kids on a person who doesn't want them even after experiencing the ""joys of parenthood"" is a terrible idea (even if he says he would do it rather than lose her - that is a terrible reason to have kids) and OP would probably be incredibly unhappy giving up her desire for a larger family."

I would suggest kicking her and all her friends to the curb and never looking back. It is pretty obvious to me that they never ""that disavowed her after she left me"" and only kept their mouths shut around you.

Depending on what happened, you might be able to find out what was going on after the accident by talking to the attending staff. They might be able to tell you what was talked about."
We don't really get enough examples of /why/ they don't get along or what your mother is doing that sets her off so badly.  It's hard to tell if she is being reasonable or ridiculous without more information.
"Ten days.

It's crazy they want to try to put his actions on me and I don't want to deal with them"" or something to that effect. 

Obviously, as your Mom has confirmed and so will I, 3rd party with no investment in your life, What adults choose to do is not your fault. "
"If this has been a struggle for 10 years then there are so many easy fixes.

If you accept trash is your chore, then manage your chore.

You should take the trash out frequently enough that she doesn't ever have to take it out, even if it's not 100% full. 

You can make it as frequent as necessary! Every day! Every second day! Or Sundays and Wednesdays are trash days! 

Or buy a larger bin so that you only have to do it once a week! 

Voila, you never get pissed off about no liner again, she doesn't stumble across a full trash and feel pissed off that she has to do your job. You literally never have to have this fight again. All the control is in your hands!"

TRANSLATION: You need to put ME AND FAMILY before your feelings.

And yes your sister needs years of sobriety and a marked change in overall behavior. Oh and an actual apology to you and your wife. 

And no you want your child to know the person  your sister USED to be. That person doesn't exist right now and you need to accept  that. 

Until your sister is stable and has made real amends you need to go no contact with her. No calls emails etc. The fun part will be getting your mother to respect this and not constantly funnel info to her. "
"I think the brother is actually trying to tell OP but is just being shot down. After all manga is the only way to view this material without being arrested (and even that isn't true in all countries).

OP if you can stomach it, try and actually listen to what he is trying to tell you without dismissing it. Then continue to encourage therapy, maybe even go to a session yourself to ask about how they would advise such a thing."
"From all your replies I really lean towards ""let this go"".  You have guests over.  It's an earring.  He cleaned the place.  If my SO found something he believed to be my jewelry he'd put it on my nightstand too.

A guest lost an earring.  He found it and put it on your nightstand thinking it was yours.

What side piece would *take her earings off*, leave them on a nightstand, then forget *one* of them?"
"You have every right to not shave your legs, and to not shave your armpits.

He has every right not to like it, and decide if its a deal breaker for him.

Pick your battles, if its important for you not to shave for whatever reason then don't shave, but a lack of sexual attraction can kill a marriage.  HE CANT HELP what he finds unattractive, just keep that in mind. 

On occasion my girlfriend brings up the idea of not shaving (jokingly), my response is ""No problem for me, but I'm shaving off this beard!!"".  The response is usually met with a ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO"".  Checkmate. "
"&gt; does citalopram cause cheating behaviours?

No, and even if it was a side effect it wouldn't happen two years into taking it. He's just trying to find an extremely lame excuse for cheating on you."
"Hi there,

Reading through all your replies make it clear that you do truly love your little one, and on top of it being the possibilities of postpartum and anxiety, it sounds like you need some time for yourself!

How is your relationship with your boyfriend? Do you guys go on dates? Can you get someone to babysit? Leave the baby with your parents for the night or even the weekend? 

My sister had her first child at 18. All she ever wanted was to be a mum but she locked herself in after she had my niece and it ate away at her.

She finally asked for help and we gave her that - sometimes weekends, sometimes the night, sometimes just a few hours... to allow her and her boyfriend to be people. People who weren't just parents.

I know you said you've got anxiety but I feel like some young mother groups would be excellent for you. Other mum's feel like this too. You're not alone. And at six months without a break, no wonder you're burning out!"
"yup, I read this and was immediately thinking: dude was hung up on a catfish for 3 years! He never even spoke on the phone with ""her"" -- could have been literally anyone on this planet.

So not only is this guy inconsiderate and disrespectful, he's also not that smart."
"OP, there are red flags all over this post. He tried to victim-blame you/implied you were cheating and he's afraid other people will judge him FOR NOT CONTROLLING YOU. Tell whoever you want about your experience and, if you don't kick his ass to the curb over this, be extremely careful going forward. He shouldn't be ""letting"" you do anything. "
"you didn't do anything, his mom is just an asshole. your boyfriend sounds wonderful, though. he immediately stood up for you and didn't put up with any bullshit. 

maybe she'll get over Mariah, maybe she won't, but you aren't responsible for your boyfriend's relationship with her. just keep being polite, and if it gets to the point where you can't be around her because she's rude, you can only blame his mom for her attitude. I hope with time she accepts you."
"Yeah, that relationship was baaaaaaad, not just ""bad"".

In regards to the difference between too high expectations, and too low expectations I think it wold be good for you to talk with some friends/family who have relationships that you respect, and who seem happy with each other, because there really isn't a perfect-fit-all recipe, but you do seem like you had way too low expectations going into it.

As a general rule I think John Gottman's 5 to 1 ratio is a good rule of thumb...meaning, you should have about 5 times as many positive interactions with your SO for every bad one. It doesn't mean you'll never fight or have bad days...just that those times should be less often than the positives."
"I know. Thank you for your reply. I just can't stop thinking about the good times right now. This comment really puts it into perspective, especially ""Your best friend would never hit you"". "
Or to just find pictures of some model and say they're yours. He never even webcammed with this person! SMH.
"Yup. If anyone mentions it, just say you're proud of what you accomplished. Bring up that you studied so hard so you could help other students.

She make the joke trying to make you feel shame.  Flip the script and just own it.  Wonder aloud why she's still so invested in you over a year later - did all the PT from karate make her jealous?"
"If you currently have practically no relationship with your sisters, you don't lose anything by trying to reach out to them. Tell them more or less what you told us, and see what they say.

You should be prepared for the possibility that they do resent you on some level for remaining oblivious about all of this for such a long time, and they may be sceptical that you have had a sudden epiphany just because you've had a daughter. Or they might believe it, and feel bitter that you only noticed that there was a problem once it affected you personally.

But they are also adults now, and they grew up in the same family and community.  They should be well aware of the influence that a conservative upbringing like yours can have on people, and that they can't blame you entirely for the indoctrination that you received as a child. I hope that they would be willing to try to rebuild the relationship and see what kind of a person you are today.

Don't expect a particular reaction from them -- it may be lukewarm, unfriendly or not immediate. But I think it's worth trying -- it seems like the right thing to do, even if you never get the close sibling relationship that you're hoping for."
"Ok indian girl here. I'm sorry to tell you this honey, but unless his parents are very modern thinking people (which they are not) you and him are not going to work out.


1. He is always going to pick his family first, as you can tell by his behaviour. And his family doesn't seem to like you a lot. He is just using you for sex. Eventually he will settle down with a indian woman. This happens so often, even if the girl is white. By his behavior you can already tell how little he cares about you. 


2. There are some serious tensions going on between black and indian people in India and outside India. Dating a black person is a huge NO GO even for non strict indian parents. 
There is a huge issue with racism going on in the indian community as they can be very biased (it's very hypocritical). So your skin colour is going to be a huge issue especially when it comes to having kids (dark skin = ugly).




There are so much other things that are playing into your situation and it's very complicated, but honestly this guy himself is just a huge RED FLAG. And I would stay away from him. Interracial relationships between black and indian people rarely survive and only do if the families come around. His won't. You deserve better.

"
"&gt; I only had unprotected sex with 3-4 girls (non relationship), and I tested myself right away

(Adding on) It also takes a few months for several STDs to show up on tests in the first place. Depending on what you mean by getting tested ""right away"", you very likely tested too early.

OP, you were foolish with 3 to 4 women. She was foolish with 1 man. You shouldnt be seeing her sexual past any worse than your sexual past."
"Simple, don't let her go through yours."
"Tell him you can't be friends with him, that you are not his possession, you don't have feelings for him, and you can spend time with and date whoever the eff you want to. "
"&gt; He said that my negative feelings were ""invalid and wrong"" and that I had ""already ruined his trip"" by him knowing that I would be sad the whole time he was on it. He also told me that he would be highly resentful of me if he ended up not going (I told him to go!), but that he didn't even ""want to go"" now because me feeling sad was an emotionally manipulative way to get him to stay.

This is the part that's full of red flags. Your feelings are **never** invalid, OP. How you choose to present them is another story, but you sound perfectly rational so far. 

And the whole suddenly not wanting to go thing is purely a tactic to make you feel bad and urge him to do it anyway. It's how manipulators force your blessing on their questionable actions. You aren't allowed to have feelings, but his feelings trump your reasoning every time. 

I was in a similar relationship, and I very much encourage you not to be."
"I've read all these replies and I'm seeing a lot more clearly and I actually think you're wrong. there's a lot I think I've been minimizing with my boyfriend. i dont want to put her in danger by telling him in case it is true and he gets mad and hurts her.. Ive decided I'm going to ask her to meet for coffee and then ask her to go into details. I dont know how I could ""verify"" details though

The only way I think she knows is that I posted a picture of him on my public instagram for the first time which is very popular in my city  so it probably showed up in her feed randomly. he has no social media prescence, she cant keep tabs on him"
Right? I don't hear a fucking apology!
"Well do they really need to know you weren't having sex? Not really, just say it fizzled out. They don't need specifics, no one does."
"&gt;I spoke to my sister, but she doesn't think she did anything wrong. 

Your sister created the confrontation. I wouldn't feel welcome if I was your boyfriend either.

&gt;she doesn't think she did anything wrong and claims he's always asking me to get stuff for him.

Let your sister know that you can handle your relationships, and that she was being disrespectful. I would reiterate how much you like this guy, and that you want to be able to bring him around. She needs to learn how to not be an asshole."
"Not to mention if they would have kids with him in this high paying, crazy hours job, he would never be around, how is that helping the hypothetical children? "
"on r/justnoMIL, there is a recent and infamous story on there about how grandma had been baking cookies in huge batches...cookies containing an allergin she did not believe her grandchild was allergic to...and she'd carry them in her purse every time she saw the child. One time...just once...she was alone with the child and fed her the cookie. Child had a near death allergic reaction, lots of hospital treatment, and grandma was arrested. 

Another recent one on there, same idea, grandma is nuts and mom fell asleep while she was over...this was literally the ONLY time she was ever alone with her son. She wakes up and grandma is naked in a baththub with her also naked child, taking a bath. 

You have these feelings and fears for a reason, do not justify them. Your instinct is telling you no, listen to it. I bet you 1,000,000 that if you allow your parents more leeway, they will not only ignore all your rules, but do EXACTLY whatever it is you fear they will, and they will gaslight you and act like you are the crazy person. "
"Wierd. Y'all have tried nothing and nothing has worked? So weird. 

Say something to him. ""John, do you know how loud you are? The rest of the office can hear you over everything else and it's disruptive. Take your volume down a few notches and tone down the complaining. You are practically shouting most of the time, and your constant shit talking doesn't help matters.""

And if he doesn't, he can go visit HR again and learn how big boys work in office environments."
"There's being honest, and then there's being insensitive for the sake of being honest.

The answer to ""best"" when asked by a LTR is usually ""you."" The question is being asked because they're insecure. You don't answer insecurity with a reason to be more insecure.

Now... you were being honest. But you were also being hurtful.

'Best' is subjective. 'Best' at one time in your life with one person is not 'best' in a different time with a different person. And, FWIW, sometimes a white lie is best.

So, my advice would be two fold: 

One, have some tact and reinforce your husband instead of tearing him down. 

Two, focus on ways now that you can improve your sex life so it can be the best you've ever had... with him.

Been married for 15+ years... and I'm having the best sex I've ever had right now with my wife. And I'm confident she is, too. "

"&gt; Who will be doing the majority of the parenting? How are we splitting responsibilities?

Huge one here. SO many families have one partner who gets stuck with all the childcare duties, while the other partner gets to do all the fun stuff. With bf's handwaving over her very real concerns... what else does he just brush over?"
"I also think u/baffled_soap is right that you should focus not on seeing MIL to much but on wanting special one on one time with your baby. This is what I came to say too. 

Just talk about how it's hard for you working away from your baby and how you would really love to come home and spend some special one on one time to try and bond after being apart all day. You think it would benefit you and daughter's relationship and it would also be a something for you to look forward to all day while you were missing daughter. "

"I kinda get his point. Ask yourselves this:

"One of the main things I worked on in therapy was the feeling that I couldn't depend on my parents. It's a huge feeling that permeates your whole life, and you really need to dig down and let it go before you can truly mend your relationship.

"I'm going out to explore as I type this. I probably should have concealed the redness under my eyes before I left the house, but fuck it.  "
"When I was in boot camp, I got auto enrolled into a bank to deposit my checks. Because I was in boot camp, the cards got sent to my home address. There were two cards, but I only knew about 1 because my mom had opened my mail (I know that's wrong but I grew up with that as normal) and gave me my card.

Fast forward 6 months after boot camp, I came back to home port from being underway 3 weeks. I had been paid while gone but my account was empty. I cried to her on the phone thinking someone had gotten into my account and she sympathized with me. I had no money for the next week until I was paid again.

Second time it happened, I had been gone for a month, had 2 and a half paychecks in there, came back and my account was in the negative. This time, I called my mom and told her my chief said I should call the cops and file a report. This is when I learned she had a 2nd card to my account. 

I'll spare you the details but the tl'dr is that I not only never reported her, but I fell for her sob stories time and again. In a 15 year time span, she soaked me for over $70k (conservative estimate.) She took loans out in my name without me knowing, she would snake cash out of my purse while visiting (I'm a cashless person now). This was all to feed her gambling addiction.

OP, maybe this is a 1 time thing (it isn't). Maybe it was because there was an emergency (it wasn't). Maybe she's learned her lesson (she hasn't.) There are a lot of maybes and I'm sure she'll have excuse after excuse mixed in with tears and parental guilt.

The reality is that this is neither normal nor healthy. Your parents are supposed to be people who have your back and who you can trust. She's broken that and you need to protect yourself from future breaches. I highly regret not filing a report when I found out what she was doing. Maybe she would have had a wakeup call. Maybe not. I do know that if I had, I wouldn't have been out $70k and had my credit report trashed.

Don't be me, OP. Report her. It sucks, but if your family does love you, they'll understand."
"I think you should avoid being alone with him because it is no longer safe. At this point there may not be much more you can do. Once you are able to contact his parents, let them know you won't be checking up on him any further. Whether or not that is the case, if they think you will be taking care of him then there is no incentive for them to check on him. I feel like there isn't much else to be done; eventually he will run into consequences from unpaid rent or unusual home projects and that increases the chances he will encounter people who are equipped to compel him into medical care. "
"He is treating you like property. 

I am surprised he went for someone as old as you are. Do you look more like 16 than 26?"
Besides what the others have stated can you safely go off your meds to even carry a pregnancy?
"DNA test the offspring. Get STI test. Meet with lawyer then postpone wedding assuming lawyer agrees. A bit of a chess game when dealing with an obviously, no longer trustworthy selfish person. She treats Bob better than you and you were not just there for the passion and freaky sex but the times she was ill or a friend ditched her or pet died. She is evil as a partner. You deserve to escape this shitty treatment. Holy fuckballs of betrayal."
"You sound...manipulative. Frankly. The woman needs to work, she has a new job, she bowed out of a social engagement to do that. You then insisted on staying not just near her, but ON her, and when you didn't get what you wanted--her undivided attention--you went off to cry and expected she'd chase you down and comfort you. And then all this 'I'm just a loser,' 'fuck it,' and woe is me and tantrum-like behavior. 

It sounds really really tiresome. I think you should try to pull it together before you torpedo this relationship by acting like a petulant child. You're 30 years old, ffs."
"The fact that you have to ask some of these questions proves that this is not a healthy relationship and never will be. Break up and stay single for a while, until you find someone you're comfortable with starting over with."
"Yeah.

He did a bad thing and is avoiding repercussions. Don't feed into these bullshit excuses OP."
"I think there is a lot of leeway when people are grieving. His absence could very easily be explained as ""I am overwhelmed with grief and need to step out to avoid making this about me,"" versus ""I am repulsed by your dead baby."""

"I don't think you failed him, you're being way too hard on yourself.  

Just tell him: hey, I know I haven't commented on your dentures, and that's because I know you're sensitive about the appearance of your teeth and I guess I got used to dancing around the topic.  But you look great, and I really respect you for addressing an area of your life that you weren't satisfied with.  "
"Honestly, reading this, it sounds like he is not straight but has repressed that side of himself given his family's stance on LGBT+ people. He nodded along agreeing with their transphobic and homophobic views, and told you later he does agree with their thinking. But hes with you, someone something he and his family despise. He has a lot of problems with himself that he needs to work out, and it doesnt sound like it will get better any time soon.

Remember when you marry someone, you marry into their family, too. You will be hearing these things as often as you and your fiance see his side of the family, for the rest of your life with him."
"I literally 'lol'ed at the ""foul play"" as if were and muttered ""yes queen"". Definitely needed to explain to my room mate because it thoroughly freaked him out to have that happen randomly. 

OP don't blame yourself. Your boyfriend did the right thing. Hopefully he will keep up this attitude. "
"Start politely calling her out when she's rude. For example, her remark about you wanting to be her friend after finding out she has access to a pool? ""What an interesting assumption."" followed by a blank stare. Turn things around and make it awkward for her. The great thing about passive aggressive people is that they are generally cowards when confronted. Memorize a bunch of blank phrases, such as ""That's nice"", ""Wow"", ""Oh, you said that out loud"", ""Huh"". All followed by slightly too long silent stare. If she makes a joke at your expense,  ask her politely what she meant. Keep at it, as though you are confused. You want to make her look like the petty asshole she is. Your bf should be backing you up as well. If the you make things uncomfortable for her, she'll likely stop going as often if you are around. 
"
"He's being aggressive because you're pointing out the holes in his story instead of swallowing everything, hook line and sinker.  He's on edge because you're not blithely accepting his decision.

"So it's not a gift you 'shouldn't' buy, it's a gift you 'don't want' to buy. You can tell us, we won't judge too harshly. Ask her whether there's something else she wants - $350 is a lot of money.

Also, don't keep a tally. If she had spent $500 dollars, you still wouldn't be obligated to spend a single one, and vice versa."
"This post hits very close to home for me. I was in the same situation as you. My best friend confessed his feelings for me and I told him (repeatedly) that he was too much like a brother at this point. I literally could not imagine a relationship with him. It's just be too weird and strange!

One day he calls me, and says while he completely respects my feelings he could no longer continue to be my friend. His feelings were too strong and it was torture for him. I was absolutely devasted. I didn't even know how to go about my day because I couldn't imagine not having him in my life.

Now I know a lot of people are telling you to give it a shot (and I won't lie, I think you should too), but this is a decision completely up to you. After about 8 hours, I called him back up in tears saying FINE!! We can date! I had decided that him being gone was way too hard, and if a romantic relationship was going to ruin it... Well it's already ruined right? Not necessarily the most stoic of reasons, and it was completely selfish but that's why we started dating.

I also told him I didn't want to ""label"" it. We didn't have to call it ""dating"". That just felt weird and forced. We just continued being friends.. that eventually cuddled and did other stuff. Long story short, it worked out for us. I fell in love with him and we're getting married next year. We actually moved in together a month after ""officially dating"" but I don't think other people will say that was a good idea haha.

Anyways, just wanted to share my experience with this."

Which is to say, OP's husband might not be consciously gaslighting, but that doesn't mean he isn't subconsciously manipulating her for his own comfort and ease - especially after reading through him using her financially for his own benefit.
"
I agree with this wholeheartedly. He is the problem not you. My soon to be ex husband was similar to this. He blamed me for his shortcomings to his family. If we didn't visit enough it was because I didn't want to or wouldn't let him when I would schedule visits and he would cancel because he didn't feel like wasting his day seeing them. His family was nice to my face but according to him threatened me if I didn't stop keeping him from visiting. I never kept him from anything I would try to get him to go but when the day came he didn't feel like it. His sister may be acting based on things your ex? boyfriend was saying about you. You should run while you still have a chance.

If these people were friends instead of family, any sane person would have dropped them like a hot potato, but you've been turtling this behavior for *years*. Hiding in a shell, making compromises, not making waves. No more. When people show you who they are, believe them. You deserve better than a father who won't stand up for his only child -- the child that stood by him through thick and thin -- and you deserve better than this crazy circus performer making you jump through her imaginary hoops of fire. 

You mention several times that you're socially awkward. Fortunately, you don't need to be a social butterfly to put this matter firmly to bed. Write an email or a letter, detailing all of their past/current behaviors, and that given this data, you are not interested in a relationship with them on these disrespectful terms and they are not invited to your wedding.

He never mentions this option came up until the DAY after you booked non refundable tickets and he has the nerve to say your feelings of sadness are ""invalid and wrong""? Maybe he just didn't want to go with you.. maybe he needs a break for a bit to hang out with an old friend? Maybe he was secretly peeved you were deciding to go on this trip without him? Honestly, you need to try to sit down and talk to him again about this and ensure that you get it across that you can never say someone's feelings are ""invalid and wrong"". You can disagree, and have reasoning behind why you disagree... but you can't tell someone else that THEIR feelings are invalid and wrong. So he needs to cut that shit out, and if he won't ..personally I would break up with him bc it is almost guaranteed he will use that again in another argument.

"For people who think it's rude to talk about money they sure seem to do it a lot. 

I get it though, it's got to feel pretty shitty to have people constantly downplay your significant contributions to your household just by default. Because vagina, I guess. On the other hand, if they're that sort of people your husband would probably catch a lot of shit for ""not wearing the pants"" or worried lectures on providing for his family. That's also terrible. 

Maybe it would be better if your husband just shut down all talk of money. They don't need to comment or speculate on your financial situation at all, you've got it under control. "

"Because he's been so honest and upright till now.... /s

Definitely don't take his word for anything or go any longer without getting a reputable family law attorney. Also, if you have any proof of his threats/claims (texts, VMs, FB messages, etc.) make sure you save it and back it up in multiple ways. 

It sounds like he's been just awful. I'm sorry you're having to go through something like this. If it helps, this level of arrogance and cockiness often leads people to shoot themselves in the foot because they think they can do no wrong. Go get a good lawyer and fight for yourself and your child. You both deserve better than a man who would act like this."
"&gt; I've asked her to talk to her doctor about postpartum depression, but she denies she has it and refuses to consult anyone, stating that she refuses to be put on medication and ""knows what they're going to tell her anyway.""

Tell her she can either talk to a shrink, or a divorce attorney."
"Yeah, I started wondering why she would take this so personally, but then the comment about the trip clued me in, since you can't send a kindergartner on a birthday trip without her mom..."
I think OP's future children deserve a different mother.
"Update - I actually just asked him flat out if I'm invited and he said no, it's just a trip with him, Kevin, Kevin's wife, and one of (!!!) her female friends who was also in the wedding party! What the hell?
Evidently Steve would be Kevin's guest, and this other girl would be the wife's guest. Am I crazy for thinking this is weird?!"
I get what you're saying but her girlfriend is being incredibly rude. They had plans for the party and her girlfriend couldn't even bother to send a text earlier in the day to cancel? I'd be upset too if I didn't find out plans got  cancelled until I showed up at the time to depart.
"Unless she exposed you for cheating, i cant think of a single good reason to destory a relationship right after an auto accident of that magnitude.


Personally i would curse the very ground she walks on after this kind of situation. "
"&gt;His ego is hurt and he's taking it out on you.

Bingo. He's feeling insecure about his position. 

OP, It's a thing that some young guys feel. Most will grow out of it; if he won't, he isn't mature enough to be in a real relationship yet."
"Second this, these girls sound toxic. You don't need an entire group of friends anyways, that's something for when you are younger. A few really great friends is a wonderful place to be."
"First and formost, I'm really sorry to hear what you and your daughter are going through. I understand that he hurt you and your daughter/ He is a coward, he's shameless, he's pathetic. You can call him every name in the book, just shit ALLLLLL over him. He doesn't DESERVE to see your daughter.

But your daughter has little time left. Precious time. I know you want to protect her, and the easiest thing to do would be to prevent him from seeing her. But....thats for her to decide. She's young, I know. But from what I've read, shes strong. She deserves to decide if she wants to see her father again. Imagine if you decide for her, and then she finds out you've been hiding him from her. She may turn around and question what else you've been hiding. She doesn't need that. 

I'm sorry. I know it hurts. I know you're scared. But your contempt and fear shouldn't dominate what you do here. Her life very well could end in heartbreak if she never sees her father again. Even if she doesn't mention it anymore, rest assured its on her mind. She just doesn't see the point in asking anymore. She could have all kinds of pent up feelings toward him. Who knows. Talk to her. "
"He died on Thanksgiving of 2013 in a very traumatic way. She was okay for a while, but about a year after her death she tried to kill herself. She said she just wanted her dad back. I think her trauma is a  mix of those 2 events. "
"Pretty much. Keeping a running ""tally"" can get old really quick. "
I'll have to see if my state is one of those states where I could get it back.
"It's interesting how we all think romantic = want to spend the rest of my life with someone. 

Romance is hormones.   

Think about it this way....  regardless of hormones,  can you picture doing all of the ""boring"" relationship stuff with this Person for the rest of your life?  A real partnership based on communication,  respect, empathy,  and compatible goals?   I have to assume in 15 years,  you two have disagreed.   Think about how you've worked through those...  that right there is the golden egg. 

A slow burning love that will stay warm forever is so much better than hormones and divorce. 

I'm not at all advising you to settle.   I'm pointing out that we all have ...  oh...  some Hollywood simplifications to overcome to find real happiness. 

 Good luck,  OP.  I hope you and your BFF both end up very happy in life! "
"Yea he's got a miserable job, so maybe it makes it easier for him to fixate on someone and torment them. Report him and move on."
Or possibly someone that figured that his fiancé and relationship of 8 years would just be happy to know they could finally be together again
"Tell them that this is how *your* marriage works. *They* can do what *they* want, and *you* and your husband will do what *you* want.

And of course they have a ridiculous idea of gender and social norms these days. It's fine to give rides regardless of gender. And it makes sense given the car situation. Another practical idea is to get a cheap bike that he ride to the station and leave locked up there.

Give them a talking to and see if they sharpen up. After that whatever you decide is appropriate because you've given them a firm choice. "
"She's taking advantage of your fear. If your community is small I guarantee she has s bed rep in it. This abusive behavior and it's likely the tip of the iceberg.

Staying with someone who treats you shitty is not good. You will find someone else even in bumble fuck Arkansas, or wherever you actually are."
"Hoo boy, so what was it that your dad exposed you to as a kid? Porn? Drug use? Whatever it was, your mom didn't stop him when you were a kid, so you can bet your ass that she won't stop him with your child now. In fact, judging from your description of her, she'll probably try to help him do whatever it is, no matter how short the visits are. They are a team and they are both toxic assholes who have zero respect for you as an adult or parent. Not knowing how to prepare formula properly can poison or even kill a baby. Their insistence on overnight visits is creepy as fuck -- a baby isn't going to get anything out of that except possibly a night of panic and trauma because babies do actually have a deep psychological need to be around their parents at that age. What exactly do they need so badly to do with the baby all night that they can't when you're around supervising? It's obvious that they see your son as an object for them to play with and not a person in his own right. They do not care about what he needs, only what they want. Honestly, this whole idea you have about a ""grandparent bond"" between your kids and your parents is fucked. Grandparents are a bonus, not a requirement. Kids don't need grandparents like they need parents. When the grandparents are a bad influence, the grandkids are probably better off without them. Your parents are so shitty that I'd go one step further and say your kids need to be actively protected from them. Be the parent you should have had when you were a child and keep these disrespectful lunatics far away from your family.

Unfortunately, there's nothing you can say to your mom that will make her understand any of this, because she doesn't *want* to understand -- she wants to bulldoze you. The relationship there is already ruined. So just focus on keeping your messages short, sweet, and crystal clear. They ask about babysitting = ""No. That doesn't work for us."" They ask about overnights = ""No, that will never happen. Please stop asking."" They freak the fuck out on you = you hang up the phone and put them in a time out for six months.  "

"&gt;How concerned should I be?

AS CONCERNED AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE, jesus girl, WHY would you stay with someone like this???"
"You could be exactly the kind of woman that the world imagines he would be with... and you'd still get picked apart.  That's just what bored people do.

Then, if they don't get a rise or new scandal out of you, they move on and find someone else to pick apart.  Because, again, that's what bored people do.

Quite honestly, any relationship will likely have someone picking it apart.  If this relationship makes you and him both happy, screw everyone else and what they say."
"Confront him. He's believing grandma. If he really has such doubts over this relationship, he should move back with her. Boundaries are important and grandma has been stomping on his for a lifetime. But he's a grown up and now can also tell her: ""Granny, i love that you're worried and looking out for me, but i'm sure of my partner. I don't appreciate your attempts to separate us. Please stop.""

You know... he could've made that skyping weekly, if it really was about hanging out with Granny and missing eachother. It's a once a month for a reason, mainly that it keeps her out of other business. Why is he allowing this nonsense then?"
"You don't need any comments from anyone here.

You know exactly what's happening.

You know exactly what she's doing. 

You know exactly what you have to do.

Do it.

"
"Next time this happens, you need to look those friends dead in the eye and say, ""Good thing I'm not John, nor am I trying to be a replacement for him.""

Turn this around and make them uncomfortable for being rude.

But there doesn't have to be a next time. Tell your girlfriend how much this upsets you and tell her that you're going to trust her to handle it so it doesn't happen again instead of just telling her shitty friends off when it happens."
"Get out.  Now.

He's told you he wants to maim/kill you and in his mind is creating the justification to do so.  Reality has no bearing on his actions.

This is a matter of when, not if.

Don't tell him you're leaving until you are safely somewhere else.  Do not under estimate just how much danger you are in."
"Dude, no.  If my husband was masturbating to photos of PEOPLE WE KNEW and was also repeatedly lying to me, that would be a pretty significant deal breaker.  Porn exists for a reason.  God."
"&gt;  I love my family because they're family

You dont have to, you know?"
"This is actually brilliantly worded.  Thank you.  I know people are going to get upset regardless.  My aunt is a wack-job, and we know she's going to stir up legal troubles when my grandpa passes.  I think she's the most of our concern right now.  Everyone else might be a little peeved but will likely comply.


The calendar thing is a great idea, and the keys to be picked up.  MY family has actually improved a lot over the past few years.  Most of the immediate family knows to ask before they come over... extended though... not so much."
"I would LOVE to be a fly on the wall and hear her reaction to that approach. Ten bucks says she loses her damn mind

edit: I'm a serious feminist and THIS (her behavior towards OP) is 100% an example of the misuse of feminist ideas. yeah, and she's being racist/classist."
"I'm so sorry for this. I want to point out a few things:

&gt; He told me I was disgusting, and he told me lots of other terrible/hurtful things (marrying me was the biggest mistake he's ever made, he doesn't want to touch me again, I'll never be the mother of his children, etc.) - albeit they were (and some still are) his honest opinion during a highly emotional time - but it still HURTS.

This is verbal abuse. It is intentionally cruel. This is not okay.

&gt; he said he used to worship me and now he is ashamed. He repeated ""...this tells me everything I need to know about the kind of person you are, and it's NOT what I was looking for."" He feels like he was tricked (by me) into marrying a whore. He will never spoon me or take a shower with me again, he says he gave up on these things, he ""doesn't want them anymore"", that ""he [my daughters' uncle] can have them.""

You are human, not a goddess. Putting you on a pedestal is just as dehumanizing as trashing you, which he went on to do next. It sounds like he married his fantasy of you, not the real you, and he has a real issue with the Madonna/Whore myth, the way he objectifies you based on your sexual history and now considers you ""dirty"". This is disturbingly typical abuser's behavior, and fits in with the whole ""married really fast"" thing. He's remarkably good at making a part of your past that is irrelevant now all about him and making himself a martyr out of it. 

&gt; He seems to truly grieve the loss of the person he thought he married

If he can't accept that you're human and humans make questionable decisions, especially during times of pain, he doesn't sound mature enough for marriage, at the very least.

&gt; He says he'll never forget this.

This is an unnecessarily cruel thing to say, and a really weird thing to obsess over. A mature person doesn't obsess this much over their lover's past, because it's in the past, and they love them as they are now. It sounds like he has a victim complex and a really unhealthy view of sex.

I think it's fine that you told him. It's your story to tell. You don't have to keep it secret, but you don't have to tell him either. He's not a gatekeeper of your past sexuality. He agreed to marry you, past and all, and the fact that your past entails something he's not comfortable with shouldn't trump what you two have now. 

I'm so sorry that you're hurting so much, and I hate to say all these things that you probably don't want to hear. But his actions and words line up with an abuser, and I don't say this lightly. I've lived with abusers my whole life, and know how they think. If he's this vindictive over a personal secret from your past, how much worse can he get over other future mistakes? Do you want to bring up your daughter with a man who emotionally abuses her mother this way, has such an unhealthy view of sexuality, handles conflicts in such an immature fashion, and has such a self-centered worldview?"
"LOL yeah, probably not what I should have said in the moment. Buuuuuuut not totally untrue."
"Oh my god you are exhausting. Youre a borderline ""nice guy"" who didnt give her any space at all. The constant texts and letters after constantly being told she wanted space and didnt want to meet up with you is crazy. And then to send her the long text blaming her for not ""being there for you"" and blaming your dad dying for you acting like a nut is ridiculous. She should have blocked you a while ago. Find a new therapist that will steer you out of being insane. "
"She's throwing an expensive party because that's what she and her future spouse want.  They should not throw an expensive party and *expect* people to get them expensive gifts.

You are getting her a gift because she's your friend experiencing a major life event and you want to celebrate.  A gift is a gift and she should not compare the price tags.  Get what you can afford."
"&gt;I know whatever I say will ruin the relationship that we have re-built up so far.

You need to reframe this. You aren't ruining the relationship by stating your completely normal, reasonable needs as a parent.  *Your parents* are choosing to ruin the relationship. You aren't robbing them of the joy of being grandparents, they are *denying* themselves that joy as part of their power plays. If they can't be in 100% control of the relationship, they'd rather just blow it up. That's what we call emotional terrorism.  You cannot give in or you will only reward that behavior. 

And if it helps - know that you are doing right by your children. As they grow older and start to develop little wills of their own, don't think Grandma and Grandpa won't try to crush them with exactly the same manipulation and emotional blackmail. This isn't a happy choice, but it is ultimately better to have a nonexistent relationship with grandparents than an abusive one.  "
"You make sense. I know it's inevitable that I've elevated my husband a bit, I've discussed this in therapy. I'm not expecting perfection from the men I date, just someone that treats me well and respects me."
"Exactly! There are often servers in private boxes, and the food is pretty good. You'll have to deal with crowds getting to and from the box, but once you're there, it should be pretty nice. "
Don't you think he probably feels the same way times about a billion because you're a 26 year old and he's 39? 
"Yeah, OP try not to focus the discussion on the gaming eating up his time.  Instead focus it on you want to spend more 1-on-1 time with him.  Tell him how much time you want in advance (obv be reasonable) and say you'd like him to plan one activity and you'll plan another one too."
"Go over your finances with her. Ask her what work she might want to do. Have a very serious conversation about budgeting the family will have to do (no cable, no junk food, no dates, whatever) if she won't get a job.

I think she could either be scared to work with essentially no skills, or she thinks the house will fall apart (cooking and cleaning) if she works, or... Something else, which you won't know unless you ask her. 

Maybe she should find something part time, and transition. Like figure out what the amount needed to make a credit card payment is, and tell her that's how much she needs to make a week."
"oh dude. I get you, and I understand you don't *want* to feel like this. because obviously, you don't *own* this sport and you realize that. Can you approach it as something the two of you can bond over instead of compete over? is it possible he took it up to *emulate* you? is it possible he talks to you about it all the time because he sees it as a way to get closer to you?"
"Watching your own child is not 'babysitting' it's being a fucking parent. If he didn't want to 'babysit' he shouldn't have had a kid. Aside from that... 

Can you enroll the kid in a summer camp or something like that? It gets him socialization and other activities (probably learning things, etc) and gets your lazy husband his free time. "
"Aside from therapy (it sounds like she is a chronic people pleaser), help her practice different ways of saying ""no"" so it doesn't sound so harsh (from her perspective). For instance, ""I'm afraid I'm not interested"", ""I'm afraid that's not possible"", ""I'm not able to do that unfortunately"", ""That's not up for discussion I'm afraid"". No need for any further explanation, just state one of the above, say ""Thanks though"" and immediately leave or close the door."
I thought the same thing. Just tell the wife they make you sick and to use something else.
"Does your lease have a clause about overnight guests?  Y'all could be violating your lease by letting him stay there.

I generally think it's bad form to have a houseguest (including a serious significant other) at the house when the housemate whose guest he or she is isn't present.  Also presumably he's using common areas/internet/water/electricity so he should be pitching in for 1/6th of those things."
"I would honestly be out of there so fast. There are so many red flags here. If my husband said anything like that....well, both me and my son would be gone.

Jesus fuck, your husband is awful. You're JADEING so bad here over something that is literally barely anything. A blip. A non sexual, drunk blip before you even met your husband. "
"Not coming home is way over the line from a check-in. It's completely rude if you live with someone to leave them wondering if you are alive or dead. 

I guess it's conceivable that two people could happily be in a relationship where ""I might come home or I might disappear for a few days"" is fine with either one of them. But yes OP and BF need to be on the same page about things and it would seem that common courtesy is not one of them. "
"So much this. 

u/MarshmallowyMochi, if you develop your own independent exercise habit, he'll just think of another reason that you're not a ""marriage candidate."" "
"It's disappointing it took having a daughter to come to this realisation but it's encouraging you finally did. I think if you write a letter similar to what you've posted here, you're on your way to making amends. But you need to do more. I'm an Indian girl too so can relate to some of the pressure your sisters dealt with however it sounds like my dad was similar to what you want to be for your daughter. You need to start actively defending your sisters with other family members, especially with your parents. You need to make it clear your sisters are the kind of role models your daughter should look up to. All those needling comments over the years about needing to get married and cooking perfectly round chapatis add up over the years. Your sisters will have resentment, (especially over the private school). If they can see you actively advocating for them and your daughter, I think your sisters will want to start building a relationship with you. If they choose not to build a relationship with you, please accept it graciously. They've had to put up with the status quo for nearly three decades and that's not easy to overcome. Remember to still defend them if they choose to stay away. It'll be a great lesson for your daughter who will pick up on things round her very quickly. Defend her every single time, even things you think are little. It meant so much to me as a kid whenever my dad did this. Having his support around the rest of my family made growing up easier. "
"I agree with this, he was living with his parents his whole adult life so he had it pretty cushy. I think he got hit hard with reality when he moved out on his own but his parents still helped him. Now that he is living with me, his parents backed off so my guess is they are thinking he's my problem now. "
"Except a lot of people like this aren't worried about upsetting their SO, because they love them and will always be there, and will forgive them, right? So they'll coddle a random dude selling kirby vacuums, but totally ignore the most important people in their life's feelings. "
"Or OP is not very self aware. I find it suspect that randomly, all her friends have unanimously decided she's unreliable for literally no reason. It doesn't make sense. What makes more sense is that OP is giving off a vibe that she is obviously unaware of. "
"This is a serious concern. Is he able to manage responsibilities at his job? Did he live on his own before you two got together?

I'm hoping this is something diagnosable rather than learned helplessness, to be honest."
"I mentioned seeing a doctor before and he got really defensive. I might suggest it again because, as it stands, I don't know that he could safely look after our child."
"Who quits his entire life without discussing it? I understand you were discussing moving at some point, but shouldn't he have discussed it again before he sold off all his furniture? 

In short, there isn't much you can do to make this situation any better. It sucks. it's going to be awful for both of you. But you aren't doing anyone any favors if you are sure you want to break up and you drag it out. You are going to need to be upfront and cut this off. "
"The only reason this happened is because you both did everything *ludicrously* too fast, and then one day  the honeymoon hormones faded within him and he woke up and thought ""WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST DO!?"" and paniced. Hell, he may even still love you a bit, but paniced at the premature commitment.

This is not you being ""worthless and undesired"", it is you and he being immature and foolish. Which is fine: you are still very young.

You'll be fine."
"Well, you've given the answer yourself, really - you need to stop seeing him outside of class. You don't have to make a drama out of it, just leave on your own as soon as class is finished and make some reasonable excuse as to why you can't see him if he calls or sends a text.

You'd be doing everyone a favour if you can manage to make the break. As you say, he's happily married, so this isn't right for him, you or his (oblivious) wife.

I'm sure you'll miss him, but he's not free and you're just torturing yourself by keeping the close contact with him."
"Uh, people just don't accidentally use slurs solely because they're angry. Some people would never date someone who used one under any circumstances, and it doesn't help that you acted nuts.

You're going to have a hard time claiming that's not the real you while simultaneously that it was your natural reaction to being provoked. Really, it's completely up to her to decide if what she saw was enough to end things. I don't know anything you could say that could honestly change her mind."
It sounds as if your husband and OP's husband learned all their life lessons from bad pornography.  Do they also think that the pizza delivery boy is ready to drop his pants the moment you open your doors?
Youve hit the nail on the head. Hes definitely playing a game to push me. When he does the dishes - he actually leaves the water running heavily while he slowly moves things and doesnt even need it running. It pisses me off so much that hes wasting so much water and I think he does it on purpose so that I'll step in and finish it for him. (Not working though since Im not going to give in). But honestly I think he would really be okay with eating out all the time. Except hes not a billionaire and it costs a lot to eat out. He just hasnt really considered it since up to this point his parents did everything and paid for everything. And now he thinks you can survive off subway which I kind of want him to just do so that he'll learn its not that easy but eating separately wouldnt be fun so I dont know how that would work
I second all of this. 
"The easiest way to deal with this is to not pay for the wedding. I bet that if the money goes, so will he."
Her hiding it all the time is why it's so shocking to your son.  Kids are far more likely to be upset by a dramatic change in their parent's appearance than a funny picture.  Just ask any father who shaves off his beard for the first time when their child is a toddler.  
"My guess is he sleeps well: he evidently  considers himself moral and pure and right, and his indignation to be entirely justified. He will probably NEVER even realise he was not the victim here."
"It's one thing to be pissed about a break-up, but to take delight in denying the request of a dying elderly woman is sick and twisted. Sorry for your loss OP.

Don't bother messaging her again. 





"
"Ok, I definitely think I will."
"I think you are being unfair. That money was given to her specifically to be used the way she used it. If she had been given a purse would you demand she return it and spend the money on baby?

Having a child doesn't mean you lose all your identity and have to give up every single thing for them. By your own admission, you are doing just fine financially. This isn't hurting you or baby in way at all.

Does your wife's happiness even matter to you? Don't you think having happy parents would be good for your child? When is your wife allowed to reclaim her identity, or is she only a mother now and not allowed to treat herself ever again?"
"OP, tell this to him, verbatim: 

&gt; this tells me everything I need to know about the kind of person you are, and it's NOT what I was looking for

Then leave the abusive asshole. He is slut shaming you for not even doing anything sexual with someone you have no blood relations with. He's unhinged. "
"Glancing at your posting history, I see that you're getting married next year. That complicates things. 

First, you're not mentioning your fiancé in this post.... which very much concerns your fiancé. What are his thoughts about the issue? What steps have you taken to secure your relationship? Does he know about this crush, and your ""daddy issues"" in general? That would be the most important thing to iron out. 

Second, multiple people have warned you about your boss. Please keep your eyes open for any signs of manipulation. The fact that you're not mentioning your fiancé and talking about your boss's praise makes you sound like someone who's easily led. Sit down and reassess whether you're genuinely being treated fairly, or simply taken advantage of. 

To echo other commenters, don't fuck your boss. Don't cheat on your partner. Really ask yourself whether this is a setting where you can work comfortably and long-term."
"&gt;  She feels like we can't live here because there are a half-dozen girls that may or may not still live here that I went out with

You could move to Bora Bora and she'd accuse you of fantasizing over women who passed you on the street. This is not a Place issue, or an Other Women issue, or a Past issue, this is a Girlfriend issue. She needs to address her insecurities if it's ever going to get better, and to do that she's going to have to admit she has them. I can't judge as I don't know her, but from what you've written here, I don't see that happening."
It's pretty obvious that he really doesn't care too much about your feelings. 
"if you aren't attracted to her anymore where it's hurting your sex life, you calmly explained your issues, and she just doesn't want to put forth the effort, then I don't really see another avenue than splitting up.

You have your preferences, she has hers. Like she said, she isn't going to be thin again. "
"you're not going back on your word. this money is equal and that means you both get an equal say, not that he instantly gets his way. 

Let's not forget that you're the one willing to compromise here and give his sister a lesser amount, he's got 0 compromise. "
"Oo, I know this one! This is the slow, long-term approach to fixing this problem, and it's not going to give you a quick fix, but try this:

Consume more media made by women.

It's basically a way of getting better at thinking about women as people first and potential-girlfriend-units second (if at all). Whatever media you're especially into, look for what's made by women--not just *about* women--and go through that. Video games made by women, comics written by women, books written by women, music made by women, movies directed by women... Whatever you're into, there's going to be a good set of it available in ""made by women"" form.

Also, try meeting people outside of your immediate age bracket. Go volunteer at nursing homes or join a learn-to-knit club. Find places where you'll meet women who aren't twenty-somethings, as another way of reminding yourself that they exist as interesting people who might not be suitable at all for you as a romantic partner."
"Usually more lies aren't the answer, but I agree this may not be such a bad idea. Also this whole situation is adorably hilarious."
"So my dad is an absolute doormat with horrible taste in women too. He recently got married to someone who is extremely similar to Sarah-- especially the part where she ""makes friends quickly."" Last year she tried to berate me over a perceived slight I committed on my father; I barely knew this woman and she called me on my father's phone to chastise me. Fortunately I was able to keep my wits about me (though my heart was pounding and my hands were shaking... lol) and told her off. I spent most of my childhood being emotionally abused by his previous wife and I'm getting too old for this shit, so I made sure to put my foot down then and there. 

To follow up, I emailed my father and let him know in no uncertain terms that I do not want to speak to or about his wife, or any future partners of his, that I'm done dealing with his and his partner's bullshit. I was extremely unpleasant in my email, which I'm sure shocked him because I'm generally a pretty agreeable and easy-going person. It worked like a charm. It's been over a year and he's hardly breathed a word about her to me. We recently had a huge family get together that she attended and she completely left me (and my sister, who is in the same boat as me) alone. It feels like shit at the time, but you have to be more unpleasant to deal with for your father than Sarah. If sitting idly by while Sarah treats you like garbage is the path of least resistance for him, then he'll always be a doormat in her favor. "
"And do it before your niece asks a family member with looser lips. OP's niece seems pretty switched on, she'll find someone who'll talk."
"That's a helluva lot of money for a 21 year old to drop on his girlfriend. I didn't spend that much on my boyfriend, who is well in his 30s.

Just checking the math here: if two tickets costs $350, that's $175 each, right? So buying hers is even stevens, really, you'd be buying yours for yourself (unless you wouldn't have gone otherwise.)

Still, don't be ""proportional"". ""I'm sorry but those tickets are way out of my budget, I'm so sorry. How about I treat you to an amazing dinner / spa day / find something else I think you'll like instead?"" She can spend whatever amount she wants on you, doesn't mean you have to keep up with her spending habits cent for cent."
"First, a question. If you had not promised your husband that you wouldn't be getting any more tattoos, do you think he would have still married you?

The way I read this, you are 100% in the wrong here. You knew he didn't like tattoos, and you agreed to not get any more. Now you've had a change of heart and want to break that agreement. On top of that, you're belittling his opinion and justifying your own position by saying ""He can't find tattoos so terrible like he says or else I would think he wouldn't be attracted to me."" That's not true. In any relationship there are things we find attractive and unattractive about our partners. Obviously, for him, the ""attractive"" column outweighs the ""unattractive"" column, even though he find the tattoos unattractive.

You're basically saying now that you don't care what he thinks, you're doing what you want to do regardless. That's not really a healthy way to handle things in a marriage. At the very least, you should realize that there will be negative repercussions in terms of your partner's feelings and his perception of you. If getting a tattoo is a priority for you, then you should go for it. But I don't think you should go into it blind, thinking he'll just get over it and he's making a big deal over nothing. That's not how you build a healthy and mutually respectful relationship.

I think his ""I'll be angry and not talk to you for a week"" bit is a little immature. If he makes a habit of giving you the silent treatment, then that's also a problem, and not something that belongs in a healthy relationship. However, it sounds to me like you are not acknowledging his feelings, and going on and on about what you want and why you want it and how much you want it without taking him into consideration at all. I think him threatening not to speak to you is his attempt to show you how much HE cares about this. This is not something he'll just brush off and get over. This will really bother him, it will make him see you differently, and it will be a long-lasting hurt. 

Is there no other way to memorialize your cat? Is this self-expression and feeling beautiful worth making your partner feel disrespected and lied to? If the answer to all of these things is yes, then it's your body and you should get the tattoo. But you also might consider whether this marriage is really healthy and compatible, if you are so willing to put your aesthetic wants above his."
"&gt;I'm asking for his blessing, not his permission, but how can I best handle it if things veer in to uncomfortable territory?

Square it with your girlfriend first. The major issue is going to be if *she* is OK with you refusing his unreasonable demands, even if it means not getting his blessing. If she is, then just be respectful and calm and explain your positions if you refuse. If he doesn't ask anything too onerous, consider compromising if possible. 

If she isn't, well, you've got a tough road ahead of you. Best of luck!"
"If this happened regularly, call authorities, explain what you saw and let them decide. 

I'm appalled by people saying here to stay out of it and take no action... What if this kid is being abused, asking for help? What if it's something worse? 
If there's nothing wrong, worst case scenario is the parents will be upset, but wouldn't you rather have that than a child Being harmed?? 

Storytime:  a few years ago I was living in an appartment building at a rather good neighborhood. One day, around noon, I was at the kitchen was hearing from a other appartment a child crying for  their father. Thought kid was upset and let it be. But the crying kid called his dad again and again, clearly upset. OK, I though to myself, kids can be insistent, maybe he is on a time out and not liking it. Went to my room to work. A few HOURS later, coming back to the kitchen, the kid was STILL crying out to their father, but now their voice hoarse and you can clearly hear they're Getting tired. Now I was becoming concerned. Who would let their kid cry out for hours? Maybe he was home alone and got locked in his room? Could something worse happen? 
I called my roommate and we both listened for a while, trying to figure out from which appartment the voice is coming from, but couldn't be sure. At this point the kid was crying for their dad repeatedly for almost 5 hours, and we were very concerned. 
We Finelly decided to call the police, described the situation and they sent two officers in about 30 minutes. They found the right appartment and later told us this:
There was no kid. 
The crying we herd was from an elderly holocaust survivor with alzheimers calling to her dad, reliving whatever horror she witnessed as a kid. She usually has a caretaker staying with her but that day the company responsible for that did not send her in for some reason, so she was all alone and scared. The policemen immediately called the woman's son and he came to take her to his home. 
If we hadn't called the police this woman would have been left alone for who know how long and what would have happened to her. 

Please don't assume everything is OK with that kid. If you have concerns please get authorities to check it out. Better safe then sorry

Edit: some spelling mistakes fixed"

"This, right here.

It's also killing him that OP likely has more stability due to her being involved in her family's business. She has the means to leave him should she choose, and she'd have the support network already in place.

And THAT is what's killing her jealous husband. THAT is what is behind his actions."
"Yeah, he's full of it. This relationship advice is everywhere and just so right: you can *never stop dating your partner.* Never. Couples fall into ruts and take each other for granted, stop putting in energy, and guess what? You get out of a relationship exactly what you put into it. Without upkeep and communication, a relationship dies. A person can leave you after one date just the same as when you're in a LTR. This attitude about ""winning you over"" means he only does nice things for others to get what he wants, not to make them happy or to take care of them. It's so selfish.

Honestly, I'd ask him to think long and hard about whether, in your shoes, he'd want to be in a relationship with him like the one you have. Where you're a ""done deal"" and he values spending time and money with friends over building a happy and exciting relationship with you. Honestly though, I don't know if you can really bring change this mentality at this point."
"If OP lives in the US and dependent on which state she resides in, she may be able to legally keep the ring. I say ~~sell it and use the money to get far away from this abusive jerk.~~ OP reasearches her options and makes the best, safest decision for herself. Good luck, OP. "
"And if she's truly OP's friend, she wouldn't want OP to feel guilty or over extend herself."
"I'm also super confused about this guy being her daughter's uncle, and this being a big deal. So what? It's like her husband thinks it's incestuous or something."
"I think the best possible resolution to this is that John Mayer notices this thread, takes pity on OP, and records a ballad explaining the situation to her which OP can play for his wife. 

Barring that possibility, I'd second the motion of filling your music-listening life with other artists and every time JM comes up, mentioning what you're into now instead after saying ""I just can't get into the new album this time around."" It'll be easier if your replacement artists have polarizing reviews or opinionated fans - leading to a huge discussion about another artists' work that totally diverts attention away from your supposed love of JM. "
"If he wants to eat foot longs, let him...but keep cooking for yourself.  But then he has to do HALF the house chores.  Eat your nice meal while he scarfs a cold foot long and see how long before he complains.

"Make it clear to your gf that you aren't interested in changing who you are and that this is you. If she can't deal with that, that's her problem. She shouldn't stay in a relationship where she **NEEDS** her SO to change to be happy. Don't change your lifestyle for your SO if you're happy with it. That's how controlling relationships get started. Tell her you like who you are and you aren't changing. "

"people aren't giving this advice because they desperately want her to interact with social media for some reason. OP indicated that she paid for a lot of her animals' care with sponsorships through the app, and that's a significant loss to take when many lives rely on you. people are just trying to offer alternatives so she can still get the funding but without the negative social aspects that made her unhappy with the app in the first place."
"Actually, I suspect the real reason he's come back is to file for divorce from OP so he can marry the girlfriend. The daughter is incidental."
Consult a divorce attorney FIRST if you two have a lot of shared assets. 
"I feel like you and other commenters are under-reacting to this. This isn't ""my husband spends too much time playing video games and is a bit inattentive"", this is ""my husband spends every moment of his free time, a majority of his waking life, playing one video game, to the exclusion of almost everything else.""

I think we're a bit beyond asking for a date night. "
Seriously. It's ok if she's offended. It's ok if she's offended or mad.  If she's such a dickhead then why would you worry about her going for a while without speaking with you?  Don't apologize for living your life.  Let her be miserable until she figures out you're an adult and she can't do shit about what you do with your life. 
"The check is obviously going to bounce, but the best way to explain this to your brother is by explaining the scam using this logic:

"Children are keen emotional barometers by design. It's sad, but this is compelling evidence that OP needs to face ... her child now is aware on a visceral level that he is unwanted at **seven years old**. I can't emphasize enough how damaging that is."
"He may be gaslighting *as well*, but it seems clear that your husband is willing to leave you miserable for his benefit. Regardless of what label you put on it, it's a form of manipulation that values his personal comfort over honesty, respect, or your feelings.

Go to therapy on your own. An unrepentant manipulator will simply continue their manipulation on couples counselling. Start by sorting out your own thoughts and getting support just for you. If you get more assertive and gain clarity about your own position in therapy by yourself, his reaction will tell you a lot about just how intentional his past manipulations have been."
"This wasn't a one-time thing you regretted right after doing it and came clean to him on your own. You had at least one month to come clean and regret it, but you didn't.
If he didn't find out on his own, you would most likely still be doing it.

&gt;will do anything to regain his trust back and rebuild the relationship, even if everything has to be different.

Did you say the same after the first strike?

I don't think this is salvageable. Even if you managed to make him ""forgive"" you, he is always going to feel like ""when and what is the next strike going to be?"". 
It's not going to be a good relationship for him. If you really care about him, leave him alone.
"
"I'm willing to bet that if the sister/cousins can't make time to pick him up and drop him off at the hardware store, they most certainly won't make time to visit him in the nursing home where he's depressed, isolated and wasting away.

yo this is some cute shit
"&gt; But if we married, we'd combine finances, buy a house, get ready for kids, retirement. I dont know how it would work down the line 

You keep the same system. DONT combine 100%. WE married and kept the part separate/part joint system. 15 years and counting. 

Sure you dont just want to combine because you earn less?"
"Honey, I need to talk to you about this new soap. When I told you that it smelled delicious, we were a brand new couple and I really didn't want to be negative. I was super into you, and I never thought you'd remember it this long or actually go find this stuff again. But I need to tell you now, I really don't like that scent at all. That's why it vanished from my bathroom the very next day. I feel really bad that you've spent money on it, and I should have told you the truth back then. I'm sorry."
"Older man, controlling behaviour, isolating you from important friendships, using false-logic to get you to do what he wants...no.

Also, how can you be dating for 3 years and he has never met your best friend?  I'm also confused, you talk about your boyfriend in past tense, did you guys break up?  It sounds like it's ending?

If your best friend was straight and was acting strange and trying to get you to stay in the same hotel room, I would not be ok with that.   The circumstances as they are, I wouldn't care (my girlfriend has several gay good friends, I wouldn't care if they stayed in the same room or even the same bed, honestly).

I'm guessing you had a lot more relationship issues other than this, probably just the icing on the cake.  Good luck."
"You don't have to believe this girl, I wouldn't go straight to breaking up with him in your shoes. I would keep her words in mind because after two months, you don't know him yet and if he does start showing signs like she said then definitely get out. 

Maybe she's just a crazy ex. Or maybe she's genuinely trying to look out for you. 

&gt;He does get kind of angry on Xanax though.

That's interesting, how so?

"John Mayer is a famous asshole, so you could also meet him and then later just tell her he wasn't what you thought he'd be and it's making you see his music differently.

"We've been married for 6 years and together for 8. I couldn't ask for a better partner but I kind of fucked up in the beginning with a small thing that has now grown into something bigger. It's really dumb so bear with me.

Basically, when we first got together I had a blowjob in my car. It was my ex-girlfriend's. My wife found the blowjob and teased me about liking blowjobs. I didn't want to tell her that it was my ex's so I was just like ""Yeah I like blowjobs so what""

big mistake

Turns out my wife thought it was the cutest thing ever for an adult male to like blowjobs. She began giving me blowjobs for holidays and she would always do it in the house. I became known as the guy who loves blowjobs in our friend group. I accepted it. I figured, big deal, who cares what's going on down there. I figured it would pass and it wasn't really something I thought much about.

I guess it began escalating and I didn't really notice. Pretty much every significant moment in my life now coincides with blowjobs. Most of the time when we have sex blowjobs are going on in the background. It was happening when I found out my dad died. I got a promotion at work and she was blowing away in the car.

I don't think I can just tell my wife the truth at this point. She walked down the aisle at our wedding to a blowjob. I just found out that she bought me surprise tickets to get a blowjob live, and they were very expensive and she also got passes so I could get one backstage. She was so happy and excited to give them to me and I just feel like this has gone too far. I feel like I'm living a lie but I don't know what to do. Thanks to my wife, everyone in my life now thinks I am blowjobs' Number 1 fan. Part of me doesn't want to give up that part of my identify but the other part doesn't want to stand with a bunch of teenage girls to get one at a concert

Edit: Thanks for all your answers, everyone. I appreciate it. Also, want to clarify that I didn't mean to offend any blowjob fans. I think it takes a lot of talent, but I was just feeling guilty that I let this go so far.

tl;dr: lied to my wife about liking blowjobs; my life now revolves around blowjobs and I'm looking for clarity"
"Thank you so much for this...I wish my mother would understand and not paint me as the bad guy here. This is exactly it. Sending an internet hug your way, friend"
I think she was trying to communicate her husband's tone when he related his side of the story. 
"I really hate how people think that the elderly just fall down all the time. Some do, sure. But usually they're the least active and fall because they're weak (from being sedentary). My mom recently died at 89, and she never fell, ever. "
"You care a lot more about him than he does about you, though I don't know why. Just break up with him, find somebody who actually gives a shit about you. 

Also, it sounds like he's ""white kniting"" for his friend, ready to be there and scoop up the pieces for her and become her next bf. 

At any rate, he isn't meeting your needs. You need to look at yourself and figure out why you are being loyal to someone who basically thinks of you as a convenience. Dump and move on, and maybe date someone closer to your age next time."
"If I were you, I'd stop him in the middle of whatever he's doing and ask him to clean it up, right then and there (or if he's out, literally as the first thing he does when he walks in the door).


In other words, as soon as you see them, he needs to stop what he's doing and go and deal with the mess he made. If that means you walk out mid-shower, dripping and soapy, and make him turn off the TV and go and clean the shower while you hover disapprovingly over him, then that's what it means. For the moment, plan your showers around when you know he's home and not at work or otherwise out of the house. 


If he refuses to stop what he's going and clean the mess up... then you've got a bigger problem because now you've got a power struggle. And you will need to have a hard conversation about why he feels the need to dig his heels in and why he doesn't want to clean up after himself. "
"""Girlfriend, I don't want to be in a romantic relationship without a sexual one. I also don't want you to do anything that goes against your beliefs and values, so we are going to have to break up.""

ETA: there is probably no way to do this that won't make you seem like an asshole, so give up on that."

"One thing to remember, and it's really hard to accept, is that the parent's marriage is an entity that pre-dates and is separate from the kids. The kids are all entitled to their feelings of anger at your father for hurting your mother so much, but it is ultimately between her and him how she wants to deal with it. You don't have to forgive him, even if your mom does. You don't have to act like nothing happened. You do have to realize that you have limited input into the situation.

Lupe is 17, and her age means that her actions and responses are going to be different from the older kids. Give her extra support and kindness, listen to her feelings, bc they do matter. She is not going to get the kind of father that she wants, and that is so, so painful. She needs help through the pain, validation of her feelings, and help along that road to resignation that you have already found.

You need someone outside the family to unload to. All of you need help through the pain and validation of your feelings. Is Lupe still in high school? Is there a trusted counselor or teacher she can talk to? Don't worry about airing dirty laundry. First, this is all on your father, not on anyone else. Second, since no child abuse is going on, you can ask teachers/counselors to keep the information private (are you even in the US? Here I am making assumptions...).

You are college age. If you are in college, use the counseling services. It's too heavy a load to manage your own feelings and your sister's feelings. Ask for help. HIPPA regulations (here I am assuming you are in the US) prevent therapists from sharing any of your information.

I don't know what to say about your brothers. They need a sympathetic outside ear, too. If they can afford a therapist, see a therapist. If not, look for one with a sliding scale.

Therapy is not meant to replace the bonds you have with each other. It's recognition that this is overwhelming. If you only rely on each other, you just unload your feelings onto someone else, and vice versa, and then you are overwhelmed with your siblings' feelings. You need to let off that burden somewhere, and an outside party can absorb it."
"I hope writing that out made it more clear how she's treating you. 
That is way, way, way over the line. You open up to an SO because you trust them, for her to exploit that trust to hurt you is just *awful*. 

Analogy, say you have a friend who's self conscious about her weight. You hear that she's been fighting with her boyfriend, where he calls her a fat pig and demands that she start eating a diet chosen by him. What would your advice be? ""Oh, yeah, you should totally stay with him and stop going out to restaurants ever""? Because that's what you're telling yourself. 

I wouldn't be surprised if she throws them away or sells them behind your back. Please, for your own sanity, protect them. You don't want to come home to empty shelves and a smug girlfriend convinced she did the ""right thing"". 

A friend of mine has a pretty sizable collection, and loves making all sorts of things from it. His wife is completely cool with it, because...she loves him. Not the version of him that he could be if he rewrote himself to fit her whims. She loves him for *who he is*, and that includes having motorized programmable Lego machines sitting on shelves in their living room. I'm not saying this to make you envious, but to tell you it doesn't have to be this way. 

This is something that relaxes you, that reminds you of how far you've come, that brings back childhood memories. It makes you happy. But your GF insists that it must go, because she wants you to be someone else, and she's willing to make you sacrifice your happiness and independence to ensure that you change into that imaginary person."
"The writing is on the wall here..

&gt;**We've put off** buying a car, a home, and **starting a family because we're waiting for his business to start generating some real income**

OP, this is costs and risks of delaying your life goals is reaching the tipping point.

You have a finite about of time to have kids. Don't draw this flawed relationship out. 

Better to end it now, get over him, and give yourself time to find someone stable who is ready to have children than to keep putting it off to remain in this relationship."
"I think your husband's a bit spoiled tbh. 

It is an absolutely wonderful thing for him to want his sister to be able to have the wedding of her dreams. For him to try this manipulative bs with the ""spite"" line instead of acknowledging your concerns surrounding this and working towards a happy compromise is not. 

If he wanted to do this, why didn't he speak with you about it years ago, knowing he wanted it and his sister was planning this big wedding, and talk about putting some money aside? Why is this ""say yes now"" talk the first time he's really discussing it with you? 

This is indicative of a much bigger problem, and you'll need to address that before you can address this sister issue."
"Tell him you took another test, and you're not pregnant. Or that you had a miscarriage. Have the abortion and live your life away from this guy. You don't have to be honest with him when he is threatening you."
"Self awareness is great. 

But it almost seems like you're asking permission to continue compromising your mental health and wellness here. 

Here's the thing: adults have crushes on their coworkers and bosses all the time. That's fine. What's not fine is acting like you cannot control whether those feelings are acted on or not. So. 

Be honest with yourself. People are letting you know he can be a volatile person who can use people so you cannot afford for this relationship to go beyond a working relationship. 

You have control here. You need to respect yourself enough to be an adult and actively ensure you keep things professional. "
Quit inviting them. You don't enjoy them and it sounds like they don't enjoy you. So what's the point?
"Not your fault, he's a fucking asshole. I'm sorry, anybody who sits there and will deliberately eat a terrible tasting dish, then refuses to tell the fucking waitress an honest answer when she is ASKING FOR THE TRUTH, but will sit there making faces and umm and ahing over it is being a goddamn idiot. 

Maybe you should have let him stew but fuck it, if it was genuinely bad like that, I would not have allowed a guest of mine, someone I cared about, to suffer through just for their own stupidity. It's the same as if someone got hair in their salad or their steak was blue instead of medium. 

He's not meek, and he's not nice. He's scared of people until he's in a position when he doesn't have to be and then his full anger and rage is unleashed on you. Maybe he's got an anxiety disorder, maybe he's autistic, maybe he's just very shy as a person. But the fact that he can turn on the rage *when he wants to*, when he feels safe enough to do it is **a very bad thing**. 

This is not about the dish. This is about him using you as an emotional dumpster, and you allowing him to do so by continuing to stay with him and permitting that attitude. Get out. Go to counselling on your own. Make it clear that you are issuing an ultimatum. Get some help with that anxiety *and* show some improvement or you will leave. That level of anger is unhealthy, that level of pressure over something so very very simple (sending back something that was bad when you *paid actual money for it*) is ridiculous and terrifying from an outside perspective.

"There's a good chance the cats are marking as a way of acting out against each other.  The competitive incessant attention seeking also points to this.  Many cats *don't* like living with another cat they didn't grow up with.

Would your husband agree to seeing if sending one of the cats to stay with a friend for a few days helps?

He might agree to rehoming one for the sake of making both cats happier, and having one calm, happy, non-pissing everywhere cat is a very different thing than having two pee machines who yowl miserably all day long."
"This.  OP, you are his emotional punching bag because he's too meek to stand up to himself in normal situations.  So he gets enraged with his lack of control over his life, and deals with that rage by controlling and abusing you.  *This is not ok* and you should not put up with it !

He has serious psychological issues if he can't set boundaries in normal life, and then takes all his anger, rage and control issues out on you.  You deserve an equal partner, not someone who abuses you when he can't get complete control over every person and every situation.

Run.  Get out of this relationship.  Don't look back.  He is mentally unstable and abusive and you can't fix him.  Save yourself.  And maybe get some therapy yourself because it seems that you normalize this like it's ok. 🙁"
This guy is a grade A creep and you should block him on everything.
"Your edits worry me. I'm so sorry you're going through this, OP.

They need space. You've already told your wife how you feel. Ask that she stop interacting with him without you. If she refuses, then ask her to make the choice.

She probably has a crush on him and that's why she ended up crying. She might be confused.

I also think you should talk to your brother. He's your family. He should always have your back."
"&gt; i told her if she thinks I'm going to let that fly 

I am not surprised she got angry if you communicated it to her as if you were in charge of her.

Tell her you miss her and you support her helping her family, but you need her to spend some time taking care of things at home, and you also are willing to go to Chicago to spend some time with her there."

"&gt;It's not his fault that my coworkers won't go with me..

Except that he has the power to enforce a work function at the risk of professional consequences.  If the trip is considered required and they choose to not attend, he needs to be a manager and deal with that.  If their home life is preventing them from completely their duties as an employee, perhaps they aren't fit to work in that environment.

They're allowing their marriage problems to impact their work performance.  They might be great people, but they're not great employees/coworkers.  "
Call your wife's doctor and tell them all of this.  They will approach her about this and hopefully they can break through the PPD denial.
So more like hanging out at a sports bar? If thats the case I'm much more comfortable with the idea.
"Okay, then, don't get invited. You can't demand that your inlaws approve of the way you act. "
"Dude you keep complaining about your girlfriend betraying you, but have you really thought about how she feels? You repeatedly lied about when you'd tell your family about the pregnancy. By lying and continually refusing to tell your family you were basically indirectly telling your girlfriend you were ashamed of the pregnancy and by extension her/the baby. Furthermore, you betrayed her trust every time you told her you'd tell your family and then stayed silent. 

Not only have you shown your girlfriend that you're totally willingly to ignore her when it's convenient for you, you've shown her you're willing to place your needs and wants above hers, you have no backbone (because apparently you found it okay to have premarital sex but then tried to hide that decision instead of just admitting it and standing up for it like an adult), and you're willing to dump her when faced with the awkward consequences of your actions. You chose to bang her. You chose to accept the pregnancy and admit to it (per her repeated requests to tell family). It's unfair and selfish to pitch a fit now because you don't like how the consequences have affected you. 

You need to apologize to your girlfriend. Even if you can't be mature enough to work through this and end up breaking up, you still need to apologize for lying and trying to weasel out of telling your family. If you stay together you need to learn how to communicate without lying and put her first. If you do break up then you at least need to work on improving your ability to stand up
 for your choices like an adult. "
"Your wife shamed her cousin's wife for not breastfeeding and wouldn't leave it alone when asked. Breastfeeding is a personal issue and choice. Your wife had absolutely no business pushing herself into her cousin's wife's business. She crossed several boundaries. So please do what they pretty much begged of your wife and leave it alone. Stay out of it. I wouldn't forgive your wife either, for what it's worth. "

"Dude...it's your body, not hers, you can absolutely refuse to get a tattoo and she has no right to be upset over it.  You do what your instinct tell you to do.  At 18, getting a tattoo because your highschool girlfriend is making you is not a good reason.  You should ONLY be getting one if it's something you really REALLY want.  If she can't handle that then the problem is hers to figure out, not yours.  You're allowed to change you mind on something that can be a permanent change to your body."

"&gt;I would say really, my intrusive and obsessive thoughts are the problem.

i would say really, your husband's inability to stay faithful is the problem

&gt;I'm the one having issues getting over this.

yeah, that would make sense. why would *he* be the one having any issues moving on?

it's your choice to stay in this relationship and try to make it last despite his infidelity. but you *cannot* continue to punish yourself for not performing this process the ""right"" way—i use that word because you said your husband is doing ""all the right things.""

it'll take time. a long time. *a long ass time*. the longest freakin amount of time of bringing up these things with your husband and your therapist and doing couples therapy together. it won't be linear. you might feel better 20 years from now and then you'll see a lady in yoga pants at the grocery store and it'll remind you of this and you'll feel bad again. *and he has to be okay with that too and it still might not work.* that's how it goes.

you're already talking to your therapist about your intrusive thoughts. that's great. take it a step further and talk to your therapist about how you're beating yourself up over them.

"Are you /sure/ this is because of the anime porn incident from 10 years ago? It sounds like there may be some more problems he could have been hiding from you, or it could be an extreme case of anxiety.

If, somehow, that IS the cause, remind him that pedophiles who have not acted on their urges in any way won't be arrested, and need specialized therapy. Since he considers himself one that might be the only way to get him the help he needs.

"Okay, so here's the thing: this comment you just made is a good sign of the issue here!

You say, ""I'm not socially inept."" But I didn't call you inept. You say that you don't come across as ""creepy,"" but I didn't say you did. Didn't even imply it; I figured you would've mentioned that if it were a problem. ""I do think of women as people,"" you say, when your post is all about how you want to date all of your female friends. (Do you want to date all of your male friends? No? Then you're still thinking of them all as female first and friends second.) ""I can hold a conversation with a female,"" you say, and I wince terribly.

""a female"", you say, like a nature documentary narrator, speaking about a badger taking a dead vole into its den.

Look. You may be socially adept, non-creepy, and great at thinking about women as people. That's good! Those are non-problems! But you want to interact with women and not have your brain jump immediately to ""would date, y/n?"" and that means you have more work to do.

It's actual work. Becoming a healthier, better person always takes work. And sometimes we decide it's not worth the work it takes. I'm not particularly good at mopping, and I've decided it's just not worth my time to work at getting better at it. Could probably floss more, too. We all draw the line in different places!

But you asked for advice, and I gave you solid advice. So sit back for a moment and think briefly about why your response to ""Read more books written by women"" is ""But I'm not *creepy*!""

Then decide if it's work you want to do or not. Maybe you don't want to do that kind of work. Draw your lines where you want, man. No one can assess your life and time balance other than you."
"&gt; the cops told us it was a gangland shooting

You *do* realize that if a gangland shoot-out happens on your block, that means people on your block are involved with gangs, right? I'd be willing to bet that isn't the first, or last shooting that block has seen.

I'm sorry, OP. He just isn't that in to you. And that's okay. It hurts a lot right now, and that just means you're a normal human. 

Here's the thing, by the time you're 30, you will have drastically changed who you are. Your interests, hobbies, career goals, political views will all shift and fluctuate through your 20s as you continue to develop your adult sense-of-self. Who you are in five or 10 years will just simply be different. That's neither good nor bad, just true. 

So don't lock yourself in to one track on life. Be open, go date other guys with different perspectives from different places. Go find you a better man. "

"Is he obsessed with threesomes or something? Does he watch a ton of porn? No, this is not normal behavior and it is not common among men.

I think you need to talk to him about how he *is not listening to you.* You've told him to stop so many times and it's not acceptable that he continues. He's probably getting some kick out of imagining out loud that you're having lesbian sex and making you uncomfortable, and it's not OK that he prioritizes that and ignores *your* feelings. If he still doesn't listen, a few sessions with a couple's counselor may be needed."

I don't know if your husband realizes this, but you have also slept with your daughter's *father* (gasp!).

If the guy isn't blood-related to *you* and you are not in a relationship at the time, there is nothing wrong with it other than maybe causing some awkward feelings for your ex, which is none of your current husband's concern."
"Shit, I mean if he was just smoking pot I wouldn't be concerned but he is abusing prescription drugs, last I remember doesn't that kill people more than illegal drugs, especially since they are much easier to get?

Never date a man with a drug problem. Addiction to over the counter drugs and prescription drugs are just as bad as addictions to illegal drugs. 

Personally I'd say drug abuse is good enough reason on its own to leave. But you clearly don't mind it that much. So you definitely need to watch his anger. Since he's on drugs so often and probe to angry outbursts then you definitely need to keep your eyes open and above all else protect yourself. If the outbursts become more frequent then you NEED to leave before you dig yourself into a whole you can't get out of. 

You have been given a huge gift if insight from this ex. Don't waste it. She doesn't want you to go through what she has been through. Something that took her quite some time to overcome. You may not think it's too fair to just abandon ship at the first signs but you gotta keep yourself safe. She right when she said you can't fix him.

An angert abusive drug addict is something only the professionals can handle so when it starts to get bad you absolutely need to leave "

"Support, sure, but what does that mean in real world terms? Lots of people think their parents will help take care of the baby while they work, but they don't do the maths. If your mother is say 50 and still working, can she actually afford to quit work 10-15 years early for you? Can you make enough to support yourself and top up her retirement fund by what she'll lose? And so on. You're quite probably right and they will support you, but that may not count for much in the way of actually making any difference to the practicalities of keeping and raising this baby. I had my baby single about your age, and I don't regret it, but you will more likely than not be profoundly alone for most of that child's childhood, no matter how many well-meaning friends and family you have around. That is the *normal* sole parent experience. Everyone else can come and go, and it's all, always, just up to you. And that is a metric fuckton harder, longer-lasting, and more intractable than the practicalities of childcare and money. I'm not saying don't, but I am saying, do be very, **very** sure of what you're signing up for here."
"&gt; Have a lawyer's number on hand if they've threatened you, make sure you're backed up by any custody agreement you have.

This is important, because on a legal and practical level, the father could show up at any time and have both the legal and practical standing to see the daughter.

That makes a lawyer all the more important. At this point, OP needs to serve her husband divorce papers and formalize the separation. "
"Direct is good. Or you can say nothing and seethe with anger.

I think it's funny you think asking her to ""please do the dishes"" is rude, but kicking her out with some lame excuse is not. "
Surprise gifts period seems extravegant to me already. I was mostly used to birthdays and christmas. The rest was saving up from chores and asking to drive me to Toys R Us.
"Your husband grew up here. He'll probably have something to say about almost anyone else who grew up there. If you want to make any friends -- besides his, assuming he has them -- you're going to have to come to your own conclusions about who they are. The dog incident was what, 15-20 years ago? Even if Lucy was at fault, she has probably evolved as a person (slower/less than one might in a place like New Duckburg, but still). My suggestion would be to emphasize how important it is to you that you have a friend here and reintroduce them. Then repeat for every other person you befriend that he has a story about in this town."
I know right?! I'm married. My husband absolutely would unclog a toilet I clogged but you bet your ass I'd be trying to deal with it on my own first. And if it kept happening I'd be trying to figure out what I could do to avoid it (including flushing half way through!).

"Does your wife interact more with her coworkers? You sound like you don't socialize with your coworkers, don't chat with your coworkers about personal topics, &amp; don't really strive to develop personal relationships with them as a way to team build. If your wife is more involved with her coworkers socially, she may be applying her same framework to your situation. (Example: if her coworkers chat to her about their weekends, then she may be thinking that you sit around &amp; casually discuss your coworkers' extramarital affairs with them.) So I think the first step is to confirm to her that you find their behavior unacceptable but have been dealing with it by avoiding personal connections with those coworkers. You agree with her that it's unacceptable behavior, so get on common ground there. Once she's feeling reassured that you're not tolerant of the cheating behavior - you just deal with it by disengaging - you should be in a less emotional, more logical place to discuss how to handle the next step in your career.

"First of all: you are awesome, and immediately did the most important part, which is closing the account and getting brand new ones where you're the only authorized user.

Second: I'm so sorry that this happened to you.

Third: I understand why you don't want to tell your dad, I understand that you don't want the disruption of a divorce right now.
Here's why I think you should tell him anyway:

*Chances are that your mother is an authorized user on his accounts too.* It sounds like your mom is in real trouble when it comes to money, and right now that might spell big trouble for your family. Your dad needs to know. If she takes up credit card debt, he might be liable for it. She's already behind on rent, that's a huge problem for your family *right now*.

I know you want everything to be fine right now, and it's easy to think that you can make the sacrifice of delaying buying your car just to keep the peace a little longer. But sweeping this under the rug won't stop the problem, it will only make it bigger.


I'm sorry, OP."
"I have a certain amount of experience in this. Not the same situation at all, but dealing with a mix of emotions including a lot of anger and bitterness against a person I loved very much, who passed leaving more questions than answers.

First of all, professional grief counselors deal with this all the time. As it turns out, no people are saints. People are all to some degree ""complicated"". There are a lot of practical exercises you can do to help you work through your emotions constructively.  That's why I really recommend you speak about this with a professional.

One important step is understanding that it's really normal to not feel abject grief when a loved one dies. They continue to be a flawed human being even after death. It's okay to ""speak ill of the dead"" and it's okay to be angry, bitter, resentful, all that stuff. It's okay to hold them accountable and responsible for the shitty things they did while alive, and it's okay to find those things hard to forgive (or impossible to forgive).

What is/was difficult for me was not being able to get any closure, any answers, any remorse from him. That is a big struggle. I found that what helped me the most was talking about it with other family members. I was really surprised to find I wasn't the only one who had complicated feelings and who needed to vent/rant/complain/cry over the things that happened. We support each other a lot, and process has been going on for some years now. But I have found a lot more peace through those conversations with people who also knew and loved him. Maybe there are friends or family you could talk about this with as well?

But yeah, you really should find yourself a therapist or counselor as soon as possible. It's not good to have to cope with these feelings by yourself."

"Have you noticed that when you react to his abuse and call him on it, suddenly his feelings being hurt is a valid topic for conversation while your feelings being hurt deserve a nonpology?

His feelings matter and deserve to be expressed. Yours do not. You are his punching bag. He does not seem to see a reason to change the way he treats you. So yes, it is time for you to leave."
"Consider taking a class or going to a finance- or investment-related Meetup group. 

Look up John Cheese on getting out of poverty. He does or used to write for cracked dot com, I'm sure his amusing but truthful lists/articles will ring true to both of you. 

For instance, number 4 in his article ""The Five Stupidest Habits You Develop Growing Up Poor"" is that when you get your hands on some money, it must be spent *right goddamn now*.  The bank account will again be close to zero, but there's a new tv in the living room (...sound familiar?).   But he goes on to write about how he stopped these patterns and how well he's doing now and what a relief it is to be more solvent and be out of those bad habits."
Which is exactly why you need to talk to a counselor and a lawyer. The first to decide if it's a good idea to let him in and the second because if you decide no your ex and grandma may barge in anyways 
"Someone can eat until they're full and enjoy ice cream and still take care of herself.

"Talk to your doctor about childbirth. There are always risks for complications, but every single thing doesn't happen to every single woman. For example - if one woman had a bad tear, that doesn't mean you will. Or just because one woman had a prolapse, doesn't mean you will. Hell, I know a woman who said that getting her tongue pierced was more painful than childbirth. It's different for everyone, but your doctor who knows you can give you an honest answer as to what you can expect, the odds of certain things happening, etc.

That being said, if you truly have a fear of pregnancy (like I do), you should talk to your boyfriend about other options, like adopting. If you want kids but don't want to give birth, this is one option you can explore. If your boyfriend is hell-bent on having biological children, I honestly can't see this relationship working out unless you seek therapy for your fears. Your first pregnancy will be almost a year of horrible anxiety unless you fix this - and even then, you should only do that if you *really* want to have biological kids.

&gt;I expressed my concern him and he just said he doesn't think I should worry about it because ""it can't be that bad with modern medicine"".

Easy for him to say. Let him squeeze a watermelon through his pee hole and then let us know how bad it isn't."
"&gt;She needs a script to follow that allows her to say no, but not be rude or hurt someone's feelings.

This is key. For most of us who've struggled to say no, it's not so much the ""no"" itself as the fear of seeming mean or rude. Realising that I won't look rude if I smile and say ""oh, I'm not interested, thank you!"" was a big step for me. 

The other problem is that the really pushy salespeople don't leave it at that. They will say ""can I ask *why* you're not interested?"" and push and push and guilt trip. Or they'll barely give you a chance to say ""no"" in the first place. The important thing to remember in those cases is that *they* are the ones being rude, and trying to take advantage of your kind nature in order to manipulate you into doing something they know you don't want to do. And since *they* are being rude, a flat ""no thank you"" and walking away/shutting the door/hanging up the phone is perfectly appropriate. But it takes practice.  "

"Wow. I'm honestly shocked. Like he didn't even do this in a moment of anger during a fight, he went over to your house and did it while you weren't there. That's messed up. He could have brought up his concerns in a million different ways, some better than others -- my spouse is a writer, so I know that feeling of getting jealous of the novel, and I haven't always been super constructive in the ways I've brought it up -- but instead of having a discussion with you he decided to act unilaterally to sabotage your work.

"You aren't responsible for your mother's feelings either. In addition to setting boundaries with your sister, you will probably need to set some boundaries with her as well. There are WAY too many stories here and on other subs where an enabling relative of an addict has gone against the wishes of the person setting the boundaries to try to ""force"" reconciliation or contact. 

For example: if you are uncomfortable having your sister around your infant without you our your wife there, your mother may end up not being able to babysit if she can't be trusted not to invite your sister around without you knowing. I've seen this happen WAY too many times, so don't think it's outside the realm of possibility."

You say you've always known he's not a romantic guy and that even when he tries to gift you something he came up with on his own that he misses the mark.

Then he misses the mark again and you're really upset. Shouldn't you have expected that?

If he isn't great at *your* idea of gift giving he isn't suddenly going to morph into Mr. Great Gift Giver because it's your birthday again.

Open relationship semantics aside, you're going to have to lower your expectations of gifts from him if you want to stay in your relationship. If this is something you can't accept then by all means, move on.

But I don't think you can make him into something he's not."

"This is one of those situations where you're both wrong.

Current medical recommendations do not suggest giving any foods or liquids other than breast milk or formula to infants under 4 months, and 6 months is really the mark most people choose. I would have been very upset if someone gave my 3 month old baby some random food. However, the helpful and ""right"" way to deal with that would be to explain to the person why you don't want the baby eating food now/eating that type of food, and to come to an agreement about it (e.g. ""let's talk to our son's pediatrician at 4 months and see if they feel he's ready to try solids, and if not, let's talk to them again at 6 months, and let's agree that we won't offer solids until getting the go-ahead""). Swearing at someone like that isn't helpful either in the moment or the long term.

As for what to do now: talk with your wife and explain that you can understand why she was upset, but that you'd like to have a calm and practical-planning-based conversation about this issue-- and about any other parenting issues either you or she feel it's good to talk about now."

"Wow, this is really messed up. I'm so sorry you've been going through this. It sounds like he's going through a really rough time, and I think you did the right thing by moving out with the dog.

Honestly, I think this relationship is over for you. The behavior you described was becoming increasingly abusive, and it's not safe for you to be around him right now. He needs professional help, above what you can offer, and I think the trust between you two is broken to an irreparable point. I would tell him that it's over - if in person, make sure it's in a public space, but if he won't meet up with you you may have to do it over the phone. 

Do you have him giving you permission to keep the dog in writing/email/text/etc.?

Are there any friends/family of his that you can contact and ask to reach out to him? Tell them about his behavior change that led you to move out and that you've decided to move on because you can't risk being around him full-time anymore.

And here's the thing, if he stepped in and defended you earlier he wouldn't have to set the record straight now. 

He does have to set the record straight. Not just because it's bothering you but because it's unfair and also lying by omission to his family.

This guy was not at his worst. Everything was just peachy; he didn't say a single fucking word and just destroyed something incredibly important to OP. It wasn't even in his home. It wasn't something that was harming him directly. He knowingly and maliciously hurt her. This is an incredibly important part of his character. He'll do it again. It may not be in the same way, but it will be some she cares about and he will wreck it without warning.

"I forgot my best friends birthday this year (also 22). She never, ever ever brings up that its her birthday. In the back of my mind of course I know her birthday is mid July but as no one said anything... I forgot until the day after. And I nearly had a heart attack, I rushed straight to my computer and ordered her the biggest bouquet of flowers I could afford delivered to her house because I knew she'd be pissed ( and she was). 

I tell my whole family, friends, boyfriend and office (starting in June) that August is my birthday month. BF has a whole week of reminders in his phone. The girls know because I announce it myself in the group chat. I LOVE my birthday, I take it very seriously and give people plenty of chances to remember. 

Don't treat this kind of thing as a test. If you want something, you need to let people know. This applies only for the girlfriend by the way - your family forgot?? Has your mother blocked from memory the day she pushed a pink watermelon out?? "
"She is STILL being selfish by having her friends and family harass you for closure! If you don't want to meet up with her right now, I'd start blocking numbers. It sounds like this closure is for her not you. "

"You seem to normalise the abuse all of your siblings are still suffering. Your father is threatening your sister. Your father screams at her. Your father makes her afraid to come back home. Your father says that he will beat her up. All of you are ignoring the fact that he is an abusive scum, you simply accept it as the way he is. Your sister doesn't.

**You are fucking enabling your dad by pretending it's all fine and normal.**

Your poor sister..."

"I love cats, I'm a crazy cat lady in the making.

As everyone is saying, this is a risk you have when you allow a cat to go outside, it sucks, it is super sad that he's gone, but I don't think blaming someone for the death will be productive. All you can do is ensure that what happened to your fur baby doesn't happen to the remaining cat.

 I don't think it's fair to make your roommates be responsible for a pet that isn't theirs.

&gt; Everyone who lives in our house is aware that this is important, and everyone at some point has been responsible for bringing them inside if my girlfriend isn't home for the night.

Letting a cat be an outside cat has been proven to be really bad for them. I cannot add links, but a couple of Google searches will give you some studies. 

Good luck, let it go, remember the great memories with your gone cat.

"Agree. My wife is a lawyer who puts in about 55-60 hours a week, it takes its toll.

I do all the errands I can to lessen her load, I only do about 40-45 hours directing a large software team, but she's still consistently tired. 

I've told her that if she took a lower-paying job for less stress I'd be all for it. "
"Of course she doesn't get along with other women; they're useless to her. They can't feed her ego.

Your boyfriend is being ridiculous and should shut it down. Either he speaks up (""Lou, this is a shared home and wearing literally no clothing makes me uncomfortable"") or he makes himself scarce. He doesn't. Because he likes it. 

I'd be gone. This is a goddamn mess. "
"But your husband's sister and her fiancé haven't made it or beaten the odds. They are unemployed. They haven't risen out of the ashes by working hard and becoming wealthy, they are expecting their SIL to pay for their ridiculously extravagant wedding whilst they are unemployed. Tbh I think it's ridiculous your friends have that romanticised view - you can be poor growing up and still be lazy/not willing to work hard, and not 'deserve' people to front your bills. It's not like growing up in a hard environment entitles you to other people providing you with an amazing life. Maybe your husband needs to learn that about his sister.

I may sound harsh and I don't know the full story, but they aren't working or earning their own money, so why exactly should they be entitled to **any** kind of wedding, since they can't front a penny for it? It's always great to have a sob story but there's no evidence his sister has done anything to deserve you paying anything for her ridiculous wedding. There's a huge difference between being hard done by and asking for financial help, and another to plan a huge wedding you don't need on someone else's money."
"Of course the bully didn't tell anyone what happened- your daughter kicked her ass. Sometimes kids keep these things to themselves for a variety of reasons. She was ashamed, she didn't want to worry you, the girl threatened to make it worse if she told, etc.

Go to the meeting, and just be firm that you will not allow your daughter to be harassed at school. Let them know the mother herself stated that her daughter has done this before- why isn't she being monitored more closely? Use the grown up words: harassment, abuse, assault. Because that's what it is. This girl is a year away from being a legal adult. She knows what she's doing to your kid. "
"&gt; see if she's willing to work this out. 

Work what out? This isn't some one time thing that happened, a momentary lapse of judgement that she immediately confessed to him.

She is in an adulterous relationship with ""Rob"" and most likely plans to keep up with it well after they are married. 

He only found about it recently, who knows how long it has been going on to get to the point where they are at.

OP need to quickly establish proper boundaries for the sake of the child and not continue with a relationship in which one partner has no respect for the other. Like I said, it wasn't a one time thing that you can say, go to therapy to sort out your issue. This is an on-going adulterous relationship for who knows how long.

It creates serious trust issue and as mentioned just bit below question arise of who the child's biological parents are depending on how long the fiancee has been cheating."
"I've already talked to the girl that introduced us and basically she said that she never got a creepy vibe from him/heard of him doing this to anyone (they've known each other about 3 years I think) and that he was probably joking. I personally do not think it's a funny joke, if it even was one. She told me to ask him, but I really don't think he'd own up to it either way, so I don't think asking would do much good."
"Hey! I live in Vancouver, if you're interested in some recommendations for places to check out I'm happy to give some!

You could get great pictures in the evening at English Bay, Sunset Beach, and Prospect Point. I hope you still enjoy your time in Vancouver :) "

"Seriously. Her ""friends"" have zero respect or empathy. "
"&gt;Should I continue to leave him alone, or is it reasonable to expect him to talk now?

I think the better question is what you're doing to improve your communication skills so that you don't cause this situation again.  How are you proving to him that you will be a better partner?"

That's up to both of you... Is he willing to knock it off instead of pushing this fetish on you when you don't like it?"
"&gt; ...am not sure if I should try and find out if he did cheat on me with her.

Considering the relationship is over now, I personally think that there is little to no benefit to knowing about it now. What if he did cheat on you? Would that change where you at now?"
"Yea, it is shallow. Shallow doesn't imply the reason isn't valid though.

If you aren't attracted to him, then that is that."
"OP, you're creating a problem for yourself. You're insisting on giving them a reason when the very prospect of giving them a reason is stressing you out. 

The simplest solution is to just be vague. Don't make this harder on yourself."
"Exactly, it would be slightly plausible if this was a behaviour change triggered after starting treatment, but 2 years later with no new drugs? Nope."
"Listen to your wife. She is your family, she makes decisions involving your son (with you!) Bluntly, the rest of the family can get bent. Let me put it this way, would you rather upset your injured wife who you have to live with, or your extended family who you don't? I get the conflict, but your wife is right, and you should have her back on this regardless. 

Edit: But absolutely tell him an age appropriate version of what's going on - Mom's sick but will be fine, I'm going to see her at the doctor's, etc. "
"Tell them it's not the 50s. And it's kinda messed up that they are concerned about making sure he gets you pregnant. Like parents in sex lives like that is so creepy, my wife makes TMI comments anytime they ask her about getting pregnant to shut them up. I would tell them to either mind their own business about it and treat your husband with respect or get out "
"If you read her comments, the drug abuse IS a problem. He's abusing drugs known to make people violent, too.

So the ""crazy ex"" is right about his anger. Right about his drug abuse. And he's throwing up enough red flags for abuse that even *without* that letter, a lot of people would be telling OP to cut her losses."
"You need to be a unified front, BUT your wife needs to take point on this."
"Agreed, I immediately thought of negging when I saw the words, the only difference being that he's her partner, not someone trying to pick her up. "
"okay your husband needs to lay off and respect that you don't want to have any sort of relationship with this woman, like.... who is more important to him? as your husband he should be prioritizing your feelings, not pressuring you to do something you don't want to do. "
"They are angry that they forgot and are taking that anger out on you. 

Who are we talking about here? Surely not your parents?"
"Ultimately, it's your body and you should do what you want to do.  If you don't want to have surgery, then don't.  He still loves you and physically wants to be with you without the surgery.

It sounds like you have a wonderful, caring, loving, supportive spouse.  If this was me, I would personally consider my spouses opinion heavily in my decision because I have a great partner and would want him to be happy.  That doesn't mean I would absolutely go through with it, but I would strongly consider his wishes in the choice.  "
"This is not ""extreme pragmatism."" These are not ""practical"" things to tell you. These are asshole things to make you feel insecure.

"Hopefully your mom gave them a good lecture on how to handle an infant.  

As far as your sisters giving you shit, just ignore them when they do it.  "
"Umm, dude have you not read any baby books? Unless specifically directed by *the child's* medical provider, infant's shouldn't eat anything other than milk (whether breast or formula) until a minimum of 4 months old, and most ""best practice"" recommendations are wait for  6 months. You start with iron rich food: meat, egg or iron fortified cereal. You introduced one food at  time and no added sugar or salt. You know what's NOT on the list? Stir fry sauce. There very well could have been honey in that sauce, how would you know?  Additionally, in the calendar of baby's first year, first food is a huge milestone. Most first time moms research the heck out of first foods and they are given carefully, with new foods being introduced slowly so you don't overwhelm the baby's gut and so you can keep an eye out for allergies. Additionally, infants that young have underdeveloped immune systems. I almost slapped my MIL for sticking her fingers in my daughter's mouth when my daughter was 2 months old (if context matters, we had just been at Wal Mart, she had pushed a cart and handled money and she hadn't washed her hands yet). Think about it, you are bottle feeding, still sterilizing those bottles? If so, why would you let a *not sterile* finger in your kids mouth?

Your wife is freaking out. You have done several things here: potentially put her baby at risk (it's a small risk, but new moms are as a general rule extra sensitive) and maybe more importantly, taken away a special moment in your child's life from her. Her feelings are hurt. You can't undo what you did. You can apologize for being thoughtless and that you hurt her. It wasn't your intention to hurt her, but she's hurt.

As for the name calling and cussing, I would say something like ""I know I messed up, I apologized, I wish I could take back my actions but I can't. I love you, and our baby. I want to make it up to you. But please stop using such disrespectful language, and please stop cussing at me under your breath. Please talk to me if you have something you need to say.""

Something else to think about. She's pumping (which really is so hard) breastmilk and only 3 months postpartum. Hormones don't manufacture emotions, but they can heighten them. Your wife's brain is on high alert when it comes to baby safety. Things that you think are reasonable she would never allow. The first time my kid slept alone in her crib, I got up every 20 minutes to check on her because I was scared of SIDS. My husband had a great sleep. Because he wasn't scared. He was mildly worried. I was absolutely terrified (and I did mention it to my doctor and they were like ""it's something new, this is pretty normal, but if you do this for more than a couple nights, we'll talk). So just be more conservative, say no more than you say yes until your kid is crawling some of those ""firsts"" are out of the way and kiddo is a bit more resilient. 

And definitely don't take the kid for a haircut"
"I think his side is pretty clear though?....He doesn't see them the way you do. He doesn't view them as art, he thinks they are ugly. 

Both your view and his view are totally OK to have. But at some point, the ugliness he feels from the tattoos will overpower his attraction and you guys will become fully incompatible. 

I know it's pointless now to say ""you probably shouldnt have gotten married"" but I think it does warrant having that serious conversation about the future of your relationship. It sounds you do not want to stop getting tattoos, and he will never like them, so at some point in the future your relationship will inevitably break. Might as well have the serious conversation NOW to plan for the future scenarios instead of waiting it out without  plan. "
"Given the type of man he is, why are you bothering? Sounds like your future sister in law had the right idea. 

Ask her exactly why, she wants him to know before she does or have you already asked her. 

I think, this should be the starting point for a serious conversation about how you 2 are going to relate to him during the wedding process and onwards. He's already seen one daughter take flight from him.

Also, what happens if he repeats his questions and withholds his ""blessing"" as a result.  Where does that put you &amp; your lady &amp; him. 

I would game out possible scenarios with her, because what might seem like a simple request to humour your future FIL could screw your relationship. 

"
Drop her. She's cheating.
"Your last part is so important and it's not mentioned enough on this sub! Couples therapy gives abusive people tools to become more abusive. It can sometimes work for couples who are not in DV relationships (the stats aren't great but it's possible to make it work), but an abusive person will use therapy to learn new ways to manipulate their partner *and* hide it better."
"&gt;He buys all the groceries and helps me out bcz he gets paid more than me. He pays everything. In return, I cook, clean, and love him. 

So what does your boyfriend think about this? Considering he's the one paying the rent, all of the bills, and the groceries. Honestly, this seems like you may be projecting some of your own insecurities onto this house guest. 

&gt;She's drinking our milk, cereal, and the food I cook. She doesn't even ask. 

It's not really normal to require your house guest to ask you every time they want breakfast. It's milk and cereal... 

&gt;I was making meatloaf and she asked if I needed any help. Im thinking she's only asking bcz she wants to eat. So I tell her I got it.

So, she actually did offer to help, but you just assumed she had malicious intentions and decided to judge her based on that assumption. Okay. 

&gt;Turns out I don't want her here bcz I think she's taking advantage/free loading. Eating our food, sleeping in my bed, etc. I want her gone before the 2 weeks.

Sleeping in your bed? You mean the bed...in the guest room? Where did you expect her to sleep - on the floor?? 

Just ask her to help out with the dishes and buy some groceries dude. Problem solved. Yeesh.

Your SO should tell him this and if asked why, the answer is that this was never a long term solution and that you both need your private space as a married couple.

This is brilliant!

/u/throwaway04141561 You will have no peace of mind until LB moves out! He has proven to have zero backbone when it comes to Taylor and like /u/trway13 mentioned in their comment, Taylor left that stuff there to mark her territory.

Also, he was totally being catfished and was NOT talking to the girl in those photos. He probably was in a fake relationship with a fat 50 year old dude. What kind of person in their twenties has a three year ""relationship"" with someone they've never spoken to? It shows a severe lack in judgement. That's kid stuff.

Your boyfriend is a moron and a jerk. Stop wasting your time. "
"Normally, I would advise having an open dialog about conveying the importance of having your own hobbies.  However in this particular case, I would dump her, she sounds straight mean and manipulative.

She doesn't respect you or the emotional attachment you have to your Lego collection.  There is nothing wrong with enjoying Lego as an adult.  

Edit:  Should you decide to stay with her, make sure she apologizes for being insensitive.   And to show how sincere she is, she will voluntarily walk a mile barefoot over pieces of Lego as an act of atonement."
"Look, for any woman to agree not to use birth control mean either not having sex or being willing to give up their entire life for being a mother. They could get pregnant at *any time*, and will almost definitely end up with a lot of children. Even for women who want kids, and even for women who want to be stay at home mothers, the inability to plan when they will be pregnant is a really major inhibitor to any kind of life they might want to lead. This will be a total deal-breaker to most women. This is not ""something silly"", this is a massive ask that will require a woman to potentially sacrifice her health, career, independence and the rest of her life from marriage up to two decades after her fertility ends.

The number of women who are going to be willing to live that life is *tiny* - and the vast, vast majority will be devoutly religious. Most devoutly religious women will want to date someone who share their faith. Basically if you can't find a devout Catholic you like who's up for the no BC life, you are probably not going to find anyone. 

Basically, the vast, vast majority of appropriate women for you are devout Catholics. If the devout Catholic dating pool isn't big enough for you, looking elsewhere is not going to help, at all. If there aren't enough devout Catholic women for you to find someone you like, you will have to (a) lower your standards as to e.g. looks, personality, background, whatever is stopping you liking the single Catholic women you *have* met, (b) widen your search by considering women from other countries etc., there's got to be devout Catholic dating websites that would be perfect for you, (c) compromise on your values and accept using birth control, or (d) accept that in waiting for your perfect woman you might miss out."
"My take too.
""Hey I only took one shower last month, so here's $2 for the water.""

"&gt;He surprised me by dressing up full drag with butt plug and heels, stockings and chastity belt... and I was not comfortable and shut him down... 

That is a really shit way to introduce that fetish to someone.  And that's coming from a woman who thinks that guys in stockings is the hottest thing ever...

If you don't like, you don;t like it.  If it's a libido killer for you, then there may be no coming back from it....

You shouldn't have to feel that you're catering to someone's fetish and not having your own needs satisified (includeing the need to be reassured that you;re desirable in yourself (if that makes sense)."
"Ugh, I'm sorry OP, what a mess. You didn't do anything wrong! But your boyfriend must be so very hurt. 

The description reminds me of my dad who is pretty gruff and has no social manners whatsoever. He can occasionally be downright chatty when the conditions are perfect (usually only in one-on-one situations and when something catches his attention) but he makes no effort to speak to anyone if he doesn't feel ""inspired"" to do so. It's rude and upsetting when we're in a social setting and he won't make any effort, and it sometimes really bothers me when he blows off family or friends of mine but then gets animated with other people. 

Your boyfriend's dad sounds a lot more extreme, it must be so hard for him if he's never seen this side of his dad before. How are the rest of the family dynamics, do you think? Would it make sense to encourage him to talk to his mom about this? She must (hopefully...) have encountered this before.  "

"For the love of god, do not allow your child to be unsupervised around EITHER of your parents. You cannot trust your mother to not expose your baby to your father, and your father clearly will beat your child without a second thought."
"I [21 m] was in the same situation as your boyfriend, I am Indian and was in love with this black girl. We had a really on and off relationship so it wasn't nearly as much pressure but my parents are against dating as a whole and even though I would get shit for dating a black girl if they knew, I wouldn't want to tell them about it unless I was 100% sure I would marry the girl. This is true for any girl I would date honestly.

But here is the problem. Since you made it clear that this was a problem for you, it's his job to solve it. If my black girlfriend told me that my family knowing is such a big problem for her I would take her to meet my mother the next day and introduce her as my girlfriend because I love her. It just seems that he doubts your relationship and doesn't think it's worth fighting his family for. 

I know it's difficult when you are genuinely in love with someone. But you need to tell him that he needs to give you recognition if he wants to move forward with the relationship.

"HE DOESN'T EVEN LIVE THERE? Selfish mofo. This would be a serious setback to the relationship if this happened to me. Don't go through with the engagement until he learns to deal with his feelings like an adult.

Btw, the best predictor of a couple's longevity is *not* how often they fight. It's how they resolve conflict. Your bf's behavior does not give me hope for this relationship."

"How is it brave to tell her something to deal with his own guilt? He fucked up, and he felt bad. He wanted to fix his own emotions. It's not brave to have to own up to your own conscious. This isn't about OP -- its a selfish confession to make himself feel better about it."
"That's a good point. And I did go through a phase where I bought a lot of cheap earrings - sometimes they came in sets and I didn't like or wear all of them but would buy it because of the pair I did like. So it could be mine. It helps to get an outsider's perspective on it, though. Thanks!"
I know a guy once who took a Sudafed once and ended up invading Poland.
"I also think that since family is the one providing free childcare (which is crazy expensive - I had no clue!) you need to let your husband know where you're coming from and how it's just a lot of time together. 

This is a different situation then a babysitter situation, because 1.) it's family and 2.) it's free. I think you might want to talk to your husband about what would be the best way to address it, and then politely set up a routine each afternoon when you come home that makes it clear you are starting activities with your child (ex: let's see if we can do xyz before dad comes home, let's start dinner together, etc). "
"Agreed. She was excited about her wedding and wanted to talk about it. I don't think she meant ""I'm spending so much on you, you need to buy me something expensive"". 

Buy her a gift you can comfortably afford and put it out of your head. "
"Honestly this is all understandable and makes sense. As a short person, there's definitely a part of me that would love to date a short guy and not have the world be like ""wow you're so small compared to your family, what happened to you?"" and not get short jokes.

I think at the core of this, your boyfriend just realized that your family would be a safe place too from some of his insecurities about being tall. And he's 24, I think we can give him a pass for not thinking in detail about his hypothetical children's hypothetical spouses.

All is good, wish you both the best of luck!"
Your problem has to be the cutest one this sub has seen in a long time. 
"My ex was surprised to learn that even with 50/50 custody, he got only a tiny break in support - he still had to help pay for daycare proportional to our incomes and while I have a great job, he still makes a good bit more than I do.  Call your ex's bluff - when he finds he's going to be stuck with half the child minding while still paying support, he'll slink away like the weasel he is.  Plus, no way Bar Girl wants her shiny new relationship sullied with evidence of his past life...

I'm so, so so, sorry this happened to you.  However, as someone who's been there - it's hard to see now, but I truly believe some day you'll count yourself lucky that it happened now and not after you'd invested decades of your life with this guy.  You're still young, you have your whole awesome life in front of you.  Don't trust him farther than you can throw him, hire the best lawyer you can afford, and get a good therapist if your insurance will cover it.  Good luck!!!"

"I really like this solution best, it makes the most sense. Thanks for reading and replying. 

I don't really want to start a ""war"" because at the end of the day it's $10. But at the same time, I do not want this to continue. Misers drive me absolutely mad.

It made sense that she didn't pay last summer because she was entirely absent - but if she wants to continue to be in and out like she has been, it may be beneficial to give a little ""push back"" in the conversation so she knows she cannot get away with this next month. 

The biggest problem I have is the fact she's mixing past bills into the convo (by saying she paid her entire portion of June, but was away for a week that month, so not paying much in July when she stayed here a week makes up for the difference in amount paid). I was away for a total of a week this month, but I do not think that I got a ""break"" from a portion of the electric bill. But by her logic, maybe I do, and I should throw that into the reply to make her reconsider what she's really saying.

There should be a minimum, and it isn't $5."
"I don't know the legality of it, but if I were a dude and somone was claiming they may be the father of my child, I'd absolutely get a paternity test to know for sure.

Lighten up...fish are very little effort."
Boom. First thing I thought of is that fiancé has parents who are putting conditions on paying for the wedding.
"It sounds like you guys are playing ""price of admission chicken.""

Is not finishing your sleeve or gauging out your ears more a price of admission you're willing to pay to be in this relationship? If it's a great relationship otherwise, most of us would say that's a tiny price to pay and happily pay it - but that doesn't mean you should.

If you decide you're not willing to pay that price, then she gets to decide if she wants to pay the price of admission to stay with you (putting up with things she finds unattractive). 

You can choose not to pay her price of admission, but if you do, you can't be surprised if she won't pay yours. "
"Then if she or his friends ever ask about you reading it say ""what? She said that i shouldnt read it..."""
"We're going to need a lot more information to give good advice here -- this is somewhere between ""convince to go to therapy because she's paranoid"" to ""please send your wife to r/justnomil so she'll at least have some internet strangers to support her""

&gt; Our relationship is great, except that pretty much since they first met, my wife can't stand my mom, to the point of being rather passive-aggressive at best.

What reasons has she given for disliking her?


&gt; She'll cut a conversation short because of the perceived slight, and claim she's enforcing ""boundaries"".

What are these perceived slights and what boundaries are being enforced?  How, when, and by whom were they communicated to your mother?

&gt; I'm certainly not ""momma's boy""; moving out and away after college was a great, much needed move for independence and I never looked back.

""Momma's boy"" doesn't mean being literally attached by the umbilical cord.  It can also be things like dismissing her bad behavior as ""just how she is"", downplaying the severity of her actions, insisting that everyone should change their behavior or plans to accommodate her, being unwilling to admit that she has played a role in any dispute, and trying to make everyone forgive and forget because you already know your mom won't.

&gt; Obviously i'm overdue for a serious conversation with my wife, 

Why are you overdue for a conversation with your wife but not your mother?  

&gt; tl;dr: wife is offended that I have a mother.

Is your mother offended you have a wife?"

"Say ""Sorry, no"".

Not only does his behaviour scream spineless / poor communication / poor conflict resolution...

...but he only wants a second chance because things have gone bad with the other girl / he found out about the child.

&gt;  I want to give him a second chance because I liked him so much,

I'm willing to bet a significant sum that he hurts you if you do.  The guy sounds like a douche."
"This isn't a you problem. 

She is suuuuuuuuuuper insecure. You've amended your behavior to make her happy, and she is still not happy. She won't ever be, unless, that is, she overcomes these insecurities. You're either stuck in this relationship or looking at a break up until that happens. How long you're willing to stick with it and how much effort she is willing to put in are the two deciding factors. If it's not 100% in the latter, this relationship is doomed."
"your girlfriend has some very unhealthy feelings surrounding sex, and neither you nor the internet are equipped to help her with these. When you're raised in an environment like this, it's extremely difficult to unlearn that sex is dirty and wrong without serious work. 

source: grew up with unhealthy ideas about sex"
"&gt;I think I can forgive and work through the cheating. Men do that sometimes, right?

No. We don't. 

&gt;But in spite of this, I still love him. I can't instantly turn that off...

I don't think anyone expects you to intentionally turn that off. But a big part of being an adult is to make intelligent, reasoned decisions, not emotional ones. "
I have mad respect for this woman now. I wish I knew more people like her. She sounds amazing.
"Your wife was so out of line...I want to ban her from Facebook too.  

Look, breastfeeding is best...when it works.  But those La Leche breast feeding Nazis make vulnerable women feel like shit at a very sensitive time.  You should tell your wife that she needs to apologize for crossing boundaries and beg forgiveness. "
"""I'm not okay with that."" There isn't a way to say that without looking insecure, because it's silly to be with someone if you don't trust them. A piggyback is not really something that crosses the line for many people. 

What does ""looking thirsty"" look like? "

"I, for one, am looking forward to the update chronicling the great poop standoff of 2017."
"I get that a certain ego can develop for being a successful risk taker.  But ""taking risks"" isn't a virtue.  It's just a calculation.  There's nothing special about taking risk.  

""man, I decided to try and skateboard jump that moving train! I'm awesome!""

""did you make it?""

""nah man, I'm paralyzed for life!  Isn't it cool?""

Does this make sense?  Taking risks isn't something one should earn kudos for.  It's a certain type of skill to have the knowledge, insight, and instincts to make *smart* risks, and have it pay off.  But this attitude of ""you don't have what it takes to hang with me, I'm a **risk taker**"" is absurd when, in fact, *you're the one making more money*"
"You already know what you have to do and say. Unfortunately there's no easy way of going about it, you can only somewhat soften the blow; but to be honest, you've been more than accommodating, it's YOUR home, and he lives there RENT FREE - so, quite frankly, I'd just put it straight. If he doesn't like it, then that's tough titties. Find somewhere else to live. 

Your husband needs to communicate this. It's his brother. You shouldn't have to take the slack on this. "
"through a lawyer, not in person"
"There's literally no reason you can't use some of that money to improve yourself and your quality of life rather than buying women. Hire a personal trainer, nutritionist/cook, a stylist, personal shopper, and work with a therapist to gain some confidence and work on your social skills.

And sure, yes, wine and dine them. But if you're feeling confident in yourself there's no reason you can't meet somebody lovely who also thinks you're lovely. And rich, too. "
"That's borderline sociopathic. No, despite anything her friends and family might say she doesn't deserve to be heard. Start screening your calls and leave your voicemails unread. Walk away from anyone approaching you on the street. I'm really angry on your behalf. You will heal from this, and no one has a right to impair that process "
"Honestly, you should ask the management to bring out a plumber. It might need to be snaked or something to get the real blockage out of the toilet. 



I would also start using a different bathroom whenever possible, and maybe not leave the toilet paper in the bathroom.


You should move out at the next available opportunity. "
I would think about small claims to get back the laptop and any money he owes you.
"First things first, you NEED to get your wife on the same page. Nothing is going to happen if she isn't with you on this, or worse, takes MIL's side. Talk to your SIL and BIL too and see if you can get them to come around, because this shit is going to go full intervention mode.

You MIL has come to expect that this is the way things are, despite past promises. She's not going to budge easy. You need the rest of your family to be a completely united front here.

Once that happens, you need to lay down the law. You agreed to allow your MIL to move in as a way to help care for the baby. Childcare was supposed to be her contribution, and she hasn't made it. At a time when you guys are struggling so much with finances, another care giver for your child would make a world of difference when it comes to your wife going back to work.

Perhaps give her these options; Start caring for the child as promised so your wife can have a better shot finding work, or pay rent. Look up what similar living set ups in your area go for, and charge her that + utilities. You guys are desperately broke and have still offered up your home. You have all the high ground here.

If she refuses both, kick her out. From what it sounds like she has enough money to get an apartment or some other housing. You wouldn't be throwing her on the street. 

You have a newborn to take care of. That child is what matters, and financial security is a major deal while raising a child. Your MIL is currently threatening that stability. 

The longer you wait to act, the more she will take advantage. You need to be firm. Give her the two options above which are both more than fair. Her not contributing at all? That's not fair."
"You say she could stop if she wants. But she hasn't, and she obviously doesn't want to. Take her to get the abortion, it's the best thing to do for all parties involved."
"*Learn this:*

**YOU are not doing ANYTHING to them.** 

YOU are living your life. They are choosing to be offended by the way you live your life. And they even have the rudeness to blame you for the mistakes you make - mistakes that ONLY AFFECT YOU - that do NOT affect them in ANY WAY other than because they CHOOSE to make it so. They CHOOSE to live life vicariously, they CHOOSE to make your achievements and failures reflect on them. But they dont. 

*Learn this too:*

**You owe them nothing.** 

Really, really not. They CHOSE to have children. They therefore had the duty to care for you, and you dont owe them anything in return

*Finally, if you learn nothing else,  learn this:*

**Your happiness should not depend on their approval.** 

Struggling to make them approve, feeling guilty  when they dont approve, this is RUINING YOUR HAPPINES.

Just stop apologising, stop justifying yourself, stop explaining to them. You live your life. It may not be the life THEY chose for you, but IT IS NOT THEIR CHOICE TO CHOOSE, it is yours.

This will be hard.  For 31 years they have brainwashed you to conform to THEIR view of a perfect son. It'll take you a while to break mentally away from this.

Here are a few useful phrases:

• ""You do not have to agree with my choices but you have to respect them.""

• ""I hear and appreciate your advice, but I have chosen to do otherwise""

• ""No.""

• ""This is my decision. This discussion is now closed""

• ""This is not about YOU. This is about me.""

And if it comes to it, the nuclear option:

• ""Fuck off. Stop interfering. ""

"As for what you should do, tell him that there was no magic secret, you were just being yourself, and if he wants something more out of his relationship with his dad, he should have that conversation with him.  Then tell him he gets 2 more questions, and after that, you're done discussing it.

Honestly given how much this broke him up, it's probably time he gets therapy.  

Obviously, I wouldn't put yourself alone with his father again.  Not because of any risk to you, just because it'll start this whole cycle again."
"Look, I am an older Indian woman, and I say leave his ass. I did not introduce ppl I was dating to my parents till the latest one (Caucasian) because he was worth the fight. (Also, much shorter time me dating then 2 years) My parents who are in their 80's still make comments sometimes, but oh well. So I understand the reluctance, BUT my family is not as conservative. Coming from a conservative family...he will always let you down. He has not individuated yet at all. Find someone who is not ashamed of you"
We want an update after the date!!!
"I've been in your shoes. 20 years old, daddy issues so major they'd have a military rank, and a total crush on my English professor in university college.

Like you, my answer was ""nah he has kids"" instead of ""I'm living together with the man I'm going to marry"".

I see you will make the same mistakes so I will run through how it worked out for me.

I started lingering after class, helping him with classroom preparation and decoration projects just the two of us. He went on holiday with his wife and he brought me gifts. He wrote a love poem in my dictionary. I kept telling myself it was nothing, I lied to myself and the person I loved. All this started to make me realise I wasn't happy in my relationship so I broke it off. My prof helped me find housing and a job, he was there for me. He said things like ""I wish you were 25y older"" but that quickly changed to ""I wish I wasn't married"". Which, in turn, just changed to ""I won't pursue you, I want you to dictate the pace of our dynamic"". I felt like I had one choice to make: either I pursue him and have him a little, or I don't have him at all. When he talked more about his marriage and kids, it became clear he wasn't ""in a relatiobship"" with his wife, just stayed married for the kids. I felt like that justified it. He told his wife, she stalked me and threatened me. They were going to divorce. In hindsight, he was just manipulative as well as playing everyone. We took it public. His best friend the Dean didn't mind, which justified it even more for me. Everyone else warned me, I didn't listen. He became more and more controlling. After a while I had enough of it and tried to break up, but he kept reeling me back in. I finally stayed single a while and took my distance, then met another dude in uni college, my age, and fell madly in love. Then the prof turned into a toddler. Stalking, throwing tantrums, lying about me. Called me. Called my bf. ""Ran into us"" on dates. Tried to win me back. And the rumours, oh my god. This was 8 years ago and I still hear the rumours. No one knows it was me anymore but I keep hearing the gossip about it. I was nauseous for 8 years every time I saw him. I felt anxious being in the vicinity of the school in case I'd run into him and it'd start again. My heart is racing just typing this out, remembering how I felt when he came up or when I saw him.

He died two months ago and I felt relieved. And sad. But mostly relieved.

Don't be me. Take care of yourself, address and figure your issued out in time and definitely don't mess with guys like this.  "
"Thing is, he could have come home and told you that day. Instead he lied to you for 3 years. A drunken slip up is forgivable to me. 3 years of deception not so much. 

What do you want to happen now?"
I played DnD with a group that was entirely LGBTQ ladies...and one straight dude who was not dating anyone within the group. Dude's great. 
"IDK, I'm ashamed to admit it but I'd probably pout if my wife called dudes hot when I was feeling insecure. I've done shit like that before so I know I would. I'm not like that all the time. It's lame and I feel terrible about it, but I'm not sure there has to be something more.

edit: I forgot the most salient point. OP, you need to tell her again that you love her but that she's being very insecure and this isn't OK. My big flaw is insecurity. I don't throw big tantrums and cancel shit but I pout to the point of causing arguments sometimes. I've been seeing a therapist (about other stuff) but it's helped with this. She needs to get a handle on that, because if she's acting that way and not seeing, out of the heat of the moment, how wrong it is, OP's got a real problem going forward."
"I was actually thinking of that quote as well. Both Sarah and my father have tried to convince me of how warm and caring she is numerous times. I think if she was actually warm and caring, she wouldn't need words to convince me.

My fiance's mom is warm and caring and a lovely person, it just takes one meeting with her to show me that.

I honestly would've been fine continuing this ""civil but distant"" approach like I have been doing since the initial blowup, but apparently she's not having it anymore. 

You're right, if she tries the ""talk"" again I'm not going to just sit there. I was just in such a shock that I don't think I could've even physically moved my body. "
Please don't let your sense of sunk cost stop you from moving forward in the future. His history with you doesn't give him the right to treat you worse than you'd accept from a stranger. 
"Dude, my heart goes out to you. Glad to see you're taking the right steps of talking to a lawyer immediately.

I'm not taking any joy out of your situation, but this:

&gt;TL;DR came bone to find my wife in bed with somebody else

is an inopportune misspelling.

Best of luck, man. Stay strong and know your worth!"
"It's OK dude just get a divorce 

I'm all for trying to work it out but that only works if the other person is willing to try. 

No kids, it's a no-brainer everyone will be happier when this is over

My bet if you served with divorce papers should start talking counseling and  reconciliation really quick"
"Your town is full of assholes. Good on you for being successful and I'm sorry that your family has to deal with it. 

&gt;We also drove maybe our car was seen as showing off? Its just a C300 nothing too ostentatious.

Don't downplay what showing up in a $40k Mercedes can do in a town where most households' annual income barely adds up to half of what the car costs. 

Edit: I'm not trying to say that it's OP's fault for driving his car. I'm just saying that they're jealous."
"Honestly, OP, your mom is abusing you. She is emotionally abusing you, manipulating you to control you. She has you successfully walking on eggshells and she *likes that*. She wants you uncomfortable and subservient around her. She wants to own and control you.

It's not okay. She's not being a good mother or a good person and she has an unnatural hold on you, probably from years of abuse and manipulation.

Not talking to her for a long period of time is honestly the best thing that could happen to you. You need A LOT of distance from your mother to realize the unhealthiness of the relationship. Start with drawing the boundary. There's always a chance she might surprise you and respect it."
"As a former stay at home mom, I can relate to the feeling of not having a break.  However, I never had someone come home to take the burden off.  That would have been huge.  
I don't think you are being unreasonable at all.  If he wants to hire a nanny he should be able to work the better job to afford it.  Imagine if you had more than 1 child?!"
Can you set up a hobby space for your grandpa at your place? Then he can escape the drama and you can help him without dealing with your sis or grandma on a regular basis 
"This place has a thing about birthdays. 

Seriously. 

I was told recently that I'm an ""immature child"" because I live celebrating my birthday.

"You don't have a third child. You have two children and your wife is pregnant. She's 37 years old, dude. She probably can't face the physical toll again. It's wrong of you to pressure her to do it. "
"Ugh, what the hell. Blaming a new diet on being a shitty (sorry) roommate is low. I had to live with a sister like this, who would go so far as to never flush a toilet because she was worried it would clog. I say in this situation, do whatever you can to show her that she really is the one causing the problem. If you bought the toilet paper, take it away from her. She'll see how much she's really using. Honestly, pee when you shower and use the toilet at work. Avoid using the toilet at home for a few days and leave her to deal with it. If she pulls the ""can't you just do it"" again, tell her how unsafe it is to be exposed to someone else's feces. Dysentery, E. Coli, Hepatitis A &amp; E, Norovirus, Rotavirus, Salmonella, Shingella, Poliovirus, and parasites o plenty (esp because meat can carry worms that survive inside you, and eating vegan would cleanse them out over a couple of weeks). You tattoo. You know about bio hazards, she would believe it from you and maybe be less of a jerk. "
"No no no! He can't tell you to cover up your experience. This has nothing to do with him looking bad.

This is a situation where a random stranger touched you inappropriately and you defended yourself and other girls from being touched. You were 1 of 2 girls grabbed. Who knows how many more he would have grabbed it you didn't say anything. "
"&gt;but just imagine how Tom would feel if he knew the real reason.

I'd bet he knows the real reason, but I get the impression that he's not the type to be bothered by it. If he was insecure about his height, he wouldn't have asked out someone who's that much taller than him in the first place."

"Wow, that's crazy, because I was over here thinking that being a supportive spouse was something both males and females could do. It's interesting they made this into this weird sexist issue."
"If someone claimed they wanted to speak with me, but didn't approach me and instead went to everyone around me and tried to manipulate those close to me into pressuring me, I would be very angry.

Trying to send your friends and family to tell you that you owe her a conversation is really shitty.

It's a big decision for you - to decide if you want to meet her and hear her story/arguments for reconnecting/whatever, but I would consider what kind of person she must be to 1) abandon you in a time of great need and then 2) try to use your friends to manipulate you."
EXACTLY. And it's gross that she's roping in OP's parents and friends. She can't face up to him directly so she's hoping to gain an advantage by having everyone else pressure him.  Very manipulative.
"As funny as it is, this isn't a great response. To him it probably means you're in on the joke and having a good time interacting with him, which you aren't."
Honestly I would call the police. 
"You need to make it very clear that you will not feel guilty for this, and that you have tried to reassure him regarding your feelings towards him until your blue in the face and you will no longer be entertaining this conversation. If he pouts a little but then starts to move on, you guys could be okay. If he throws a tantrum and continually brings it up, then you need to break up OP. I know he's your first love, and it always feels like you'll never find better. But millions of people do, and you will as well.

You have your whole life ahead of you OP, high school is such a minuscule part of it. Don't stay with someone who makes you feel like crap for doing nothing wrong just because you loved him when you were a teenager."
"This may be the best way to break it down to her.  Honestly I would miss my SO so much that I would NOT want them to take the job. You only have one life.  If she doesn't respect your decision then I would be seriously considering my relationship with that person. 

"
"Shit. I guess I owe you a million bucks.

Would you accept ducks instead?"
"Am I reading this right? You own the house, you own the cars, and you do all of the housework? 

Honestly be sounds really shitty. Don't let guilt hold you back. You're modeling relationships for your children and you do NOT want them learning that women need to do all the housework, never speak to men who aren't their husbands, and not have any independence. 

If he won't step in line IMMEDIATELY I'd contact a lawyer. "
"&gt; I just told Chris that I consider Tammy a good friend but those feelings left me years ago.

Good for you. She kept you around as plan B and is now mad that it didn't work. You should have left sooner, but I know these things are easier said than done. Keep standing up for yourself and hopefully you'll find someone who likes you back from the start."
"This thinking and your reasoning for the anxiety sounds abnormal. I am confident this is to do with your eating disorder, and you should seek help for that instead of criticising your girlfriend for what sound like perfectly normal eating habits. 

If it's upsetting you that much maybe you should share with her that you have suffered from an eating disorder and you'd prefer she not text you about food in that way until you're feeling better from your treatment. 
"
Well now you know not to lend this guy money. The proper thing would be for him to return the money since he isn't moving out but doesn't look like he's interested in that. I'd be annoyed too and questioning whether or not he was ever really planning on moving out and feeling a bit used.
"so you have no idea, but you saw her as ""unclean"" for engaging in the same behavior you have 3-4 times.

Even a liver disease which could cause hallucinations. Have her creatinine level checked as well.
"Report him. Missing busstops on purpose to ""prove a point"" will probably get him fired. If he holds a grudge against people, then he's in the wrong field of work. Also, I don't live in the US, but New Jersey is a big city, so I guess that the busses go every 2 or 5 minutes, ye? If so, just take the next bus to avoid the bully."
"She sounds overall unhappy in life. If you've never seen her successfully adult, it's possible that she just had no idea what it would actually entail &amp; has realized she hates it &amp; doesn't want to do it, &amp; Chicago is just the current convenient obstacle preventing her from having to adult. If you've seen her function successfully in the past, then it likely is a mental health issue that needs to be addressed before anything else can change. Don't make any big decisions until she's got the depression &amp; whatever else under control (therapy, mess, whatever) because external things cannot fix that. "
"Hopping on this. 

I was in a similar situation about 10 years ago. I told friend. He told her he was ""testing"" me. She forgave him, I did not. I limited my interaction with him but tried to stay there for her. He pushed EVERYONE in her support system out of her life, but me and he tried hard. They were together for 3 more awful years before she hit bottom. She finally broke it off. She came out of it with me being her only friend. I told her no matter what she decides to do, i'm not going to be scared away. I gave her much needed support. Whenever he tried to get her to take him back, she told me she heard me in the back of her head giving her a pep talk so she had the strength to say no. 

She's went through a self love period and is much stronger. Takes no bullshit. 

It is going to be hard, very hard to watch. Support her the best you can. Show her she is loved no matter what she decides to do because she's making the decision she feels is best for her. You are not wrong for staying friends with her and you are not wrong for jumping ship. You have to make the decision that's best for you, too."
*bizarre. Bazaar is a shopping market.
"You should not tell her about the message she left accidentally. It could really crush her. I'd just casually announce your new relationship and act happy. Chances are she'll find a new guy and a few years from now maybe the feelings will be mutual, or maybe they won't. But it should've been up to her to let you know how she felt. Best of luck"
So how much money is your marriage worth?
"I don't know how you can make this guy happy. He changes his mind *constantly* about what he wants, so even if you tried to do what he wanted you to do, you'd lose. That's not a healthy relationship.

Also: I would not put up with a dude who swore at me. I don't think you should either.

&gt; I'm failing his expectations as a woman because I don't prioritize his immediate needs above my own

Um, fuck that. His expectations of women are stupid. That is not how relationships between two adults work. "
"He sounds unstable and way too possessive--if his mask is slipping this bad after less than two months, I'd want to bounce out fast. Shit, he tried to start a fight with some dude for *talking* to you? What would he have done if the guy DID want to throw down? I've got a really bad feeling about this, Scoobs. "
"If you call CPS they'll investigate. And if it becomes clear that your siblings are a lot safer than you are, you're the only one who'll be removed. 

It seems like you're the only male of the children, could that perhaps be an explanation? It's not exactly a logical thing, but there are some prejudices regarding genders and religions. And now you've fallen off the religion, who knows what your parents are grasping at. 

If CPS is a step too far, see if you can talk to someone in that private school that's a teacher or a counselor. Someone who could offer you support and validation. They are also mandatory reporters most of the time, meaning they'll be the ones calling CPS. Then it's not on you.

In the mean time, keep a log. Date, time, who was there and why what happened, including photos/drawings where needed. When you're asked for details, it gets hard if you're overwhelmed and everything soups together. Organized data is easier to explain. "
"Absolutely.

I had a very brief relationship with a guy who called his ex-girlfriend 'the brain breaker'.  Listening to him you would think this lady was evil personified.  But after about six months or so it became apparent that he was seriously mentally unstable and I almost lost my best friend due to his lies and manipulations.

Biggest red flag for me is someone who has 'pycho exes', particularly if there is more than one of them."
"&gt;Is it too cruel to tell him I don't want to be friends again?

No, it's not cruel. It's reality. Jake is a poor friend and should learn the consequences of his actions."
"Or he's head over heels for you and wants to show you off to everyone all the time (and is so tunnel-visioned on that, he won't agree or even be able to see that you are awkward in crowds, so convinced he is that you are amazing and incredible)."
"He's trying to protect himself from future hurt by 'predicting' it. Unfortunately that kind of attitude can really sour a relationship, and that's how self-fulfilling prophecies in relationships happen. 

Have you gently suggested that he talk to a professional? It has to be exhausting for you to try and convince him all the time that you're not going to leave. The change has to come from within himself on this one."
"Your dad is 67 - most people have stopped working by that age, and are living a retirement lifestyle on their pensions or savings. It's a bit sad really, it sounds like he's never been satisfied for his whole working life and that's had an impact on all of you.

It's great to have a dream, but at some point you have to accept that it's probably not going to happen. If he's not had any success in the last 20 years, it's not going to happen as he approaches his 70s - but of course, everyone in your family knows that, except your dad!

As others have said, I'd just smile and nod. I wouldn't even tell him much about your own business, because that may just make him worse and he won't be able to see a different way of approaching things. 

Hopefully, your own hard work will pay great dividends and at some point he'll be able to talk about his daughter, the millionaire!

"
I'm assuming you live together - honestly are you sure something didn't happen? If my boyfriend didn't come home at all I'd be worried he was dead or in the hospital. 
"Red flags as far as the eye can see. A ""man to man"" talk? How pathetic, OP, the dad is attacking your masculinity because you dont want to WORK 24/7 while your wife gets to live in the big fancy house, drive several nice cars, all day every day while you are still stuck at work?"
Keep your interaction strictly about school. You dont have to ghost him completely and I know that will be hard but the first step is to set up bounderies. This also includes no communication outside school. 
Yeah man. Idk about that play wrestling... that would raise my hackles too wtf

"I'm closer in age to your BF's mom and am absolutely gobsmacked that she could be so passive-aggressive, petty and rude to you, OP. 

If there is a silver lining in all of this, it's that (a) your pain was witnessed, and (b) your bf stood up for you demonstratively. Oh, and (c) BBQ chicken ... yum.

Just keep being cordial to this petty Pauline. She will have to come around eventually as long as her own son is enforcing good boundaries."
"Also, if you share laundry facilities with anyone else in the apartment building, it could have gotten to you in the laundry where he found it. 

This same thing happened to me, I've found little bralettes that aren't mine as well as children's socks &amp; clothes in my laundry. At first I freaked out and asked my boyfriend wtf &amp; he brought up the shared laundry. The more it happened, which has been unsurprisingly frequently considering there are 3 washers and 2 driers total for 40 1-2 bedroom units, the less suspicious and more annoying it became. 

It definitely could be a houseguest' earring OR if one of your guests shares laundry facilities, the earring could have stuck to them from someone else and they not notice it, and it dropped off them in your home. That's actually happened to me, but a friend picked it off the back of my shirt while we were at the bar. "
"Dude, you have no right to be mad. Honestly it's a harmless prank, and you're the one who invaded his privacy in his own house. Let it be a lesson to you. Also gaping is a stupid old meme, definitely pretty gross, but it isn't that awful that you should feel victimized about it. You went somewhere you were told not to go out of your own free will. "
"Exactly!

That person gave horrible advice. I'm with you, OP. What your husband did cannot be brushed under the rug.

Just *two months* after you stood up before your loved one and said vows of love and fidelity to one another he goes and fucks another women, then proceed to hide it for years! NOPE! Not okay! What he did was a cowardly and unjust act, and admitting it once his guilt has become too much doesn't cancel *anything* out.

"
Absolutely perfect response.
"OP is sixteen. He says ""psychiatrist"" but I didn't see him mention anything about being prescribed meds. You're right that this person might just be an unlicensed counselor and OP is just calling him a psychiatrist for lack of a better term."
"It seems like you want this sub to validate your ""right"" to a tattoo because it's YOUR BODY and he can't control it!!! Or whatever.

The problem is he agreed to this marriage in part because you had promised no more tattoos. When you enter a marriage, yes it is still your body, but what you choose to do to it does have an effect within the relationship. He can't STOP you from getting them, and he knows that, but he can express how frustrated and upset he will be.

So yeah, you CAN get another tattoo, and you know what the consequence will be on his part. Honestly it's pretty crummy of you to break the promise. I think he sees the writing on the wall that if you break it this once, it will be broken again. And again. He accepted marrying you with the two tattoos you came with, he probably believed he wouldn't be seeing four or more in the future."
"DO NOT GET MARRIED. Physical abuse is a deal- breaker. Hard stop. This will not end with marriage, it will escalate. You have every right to be upset. No person should ever put their hands on you like that. You will put a lot more money towards a divorce than you have this wedding. Don't do it. What he is doing is called gaslighting. Physical abuse is never ok. "
"&gt; She got really upset and we got into a big argument where i gave all sorts of excuses because me just not wanting to isnt a good enough reason.

No, that's a perfectly good reason to not permanently modify your body. ""Because my girlfriend wants me to"" is not a good enough reason.

&gt;What do I tell her? What do I do?

Stand up for yourself. Don't allow her to dictate what you do with your body because she's upset. Being in a relationship doesn't mean letting your partner whine until they get their way. You know what that's called? It's called being a bully. *Your girlfriend is a bully.* So you can stand up to your bully, and let her know that you're going to do as you please with your body, just as she's welcome to do with hers. Or you can look back with regret and spend money trying to get rid of a tattoo you didn't even want in the first place."
"My nephew asked me ""why do Nammy and Pawpaw [his grandparents] hate each other?"" The real answer involves a lot of not-child-appropriate concepts like alcoholism, drug abuse, child abuse and malignant narcissism. The best I could do was ""well, sometimes even when people love each other, when they try to live together it doesn't work out. And after that it can make them sad to be around each other because it reminds them that they had bad times together.""

I'm sure he'll find out the whole story when he's older from any one of the many gossips in the family. In the meantime I'd rather let him enjoy what he can of the relationships he has with his grandparents.

"
"Also, start being your sister's biggest supporters.  Every time you can compliment them or brag about them honestly, make sure you do so.  Every time.  If your parents downplay it politely say that YOU are proud.  Do it on social media.  In person.  To your friends.  It'll get back to them and it means something.

""Did you see what sister did? I'm so proud of her - she's so smart!""

""If she's so smart why doesn't she have a husband?""

""Those are two  different issues.  I'm really proud of what she did."""
The dog wasn't wrong here. Your son hits him with toys and climbs on his head. You don't supervise.  This is on you.
"My husband would constantly leave any cabinet or drawer he used open. I was constantly hitting myself on them, plus, it's just super annoying. I asked him so many times not to do it, but the nagging didn't work. Now, whenever I walk into a room and see an open drawer/cabinet, I start loudly singing show tunes until he gets up and closes it. Just the threat of ""Oklahoma"" has cured him of this habit, plus it's silly enough that we laugh about it instead of it causing a fight. "
"There's significant cruelty in forcing your fetish on someone at their expense. That's what he's doing. He ignored your feelings, demanded you satisfy him on his terms, forced his fetish on you and ignored requests to stop or slow down, and has shown no respect anywhere for your needs or wishes here.

That's a fetish disguising abuse."
"Yeah, that's a bit of a flag in addition to the money red flag."
"You are talking about this as independent from your boyfriend. What is his thinking about a baby right now? 

You say your relationship is good... What about it is complicated other than the age difference? "
"It just doesn't seem worth it. If you need to ask if your boyfriend is showing early signs of abusive behavior, maybe it's for the best if you weren't in the relationship anyway. "
"Honestly, this is more of a ""him"" problem than a ""you"" problem. He's insecure for whatever reason, and it's coming out now. The best thing you can do is repeatedly show him you love him. You're right, there really are no words that you can say that will make this right in his head, so you're going to have to be a supportive partner by opening up a clear line of communication for him if he's feeling upset (which it appears you're already doing). 

Thing is, I'm sure he's going to see this movie whenever it comes out and the kiss will be in there. I can't say I would smile seeing that with my own partner, but he should be able to put it behind him and not let it spoil the good news, which is your budding career!! 

I guess in short I would just be a little extra thoughtful and be open to talking. That being said, don't let him walk all over you or degrade you for your decision. If you find he's obsessing over this, the time may be to move on. I hope it's not, though. Just remember that regrets sting the most at the end of the day. Don't give up something this freaking cool over a boyfriend who may or may not be there at the finish line. 

He may also be afraid of fame ""changing"" you. "
Indeed... this sounds more like a mental block because of his own fears.
"He should just go before the birth to see her and show support, and make himself scarce if they start passing the baby around to be held after the birth. He doesn't need to be there the whole time. He can go get some coffees or snacks for everyone during that time and wait in the waiting area because it makes him uncomfortable."
"No, not her *responsibility*, but her choice. She earns &gt;100k, she's spending 10% of that on family. That seems a reasonable proportion of her income for discretionary ""hobby"" spending.

But you are right to be concerned if you are joining finances.

"
"&gt;i told her if she thinks I'm going to let that fly we need to have a long talk

Maybe this is not the language to use when you want to have a productive conversation with someone? Do have a talk where you let her know how worried you are about how long she's been gone and how long she's planning to stay. Talk about your feelings and fears, not about what you will and won't allow. Also, ask her why she thinks it's important to stay and listen to her answer. She's in a tough spot here, and you do need to acknowledge that even if you don't like it. "
"&gt; I don't feel like I ask much of him. Can you turn down the TV a bit? No. Can you switch the laundry? No.

Seriously? My casual friends are nicer to me than this. And you're planning on MARRYING him???

&gt;At his core, he is a truly loving, smart, funny, and handsome man.

No. This is what YOU want his core to be. His core is everything about him, the good the bad and the ugly. And wow, is there ever a lot of bad and ugly going on here. "
"Hi, I am a labor and delivery nurse and this is actually a more common situation than it sounds. Sometimes when there is a genetic or congenital defect which would be incompatible with life (such as anencephaly where the baby has no brain) people will opt for an early term induction, usually around 20 weeks. This is different than abortion, a woman will be given medication to induce labor and usually be able to deliver the baby vaginally. In these cases the baby may be born alive and die within minutes of birth or be born dead. It's becoming more socially acceptable to take pictures of/with the baby and encourage atleast the parents to hold the baby if they desire. This can help with the mourning process and coming to terms with what they have lost better than just whisking the baby away so no one sees it. If you Google fetal demise family photos you can see mothers holding their babies and what not. Usually the hospital will give them a memory box with things like foot prints, baby hats etc and have the chaplain come and do a naming ceremony for the baby if desired. It may sound odd but it often can be better for people to acknowledge and openly grieve their baby and mourn her loss rather than pretend it never happened. Not everyone is comfortable with this but it is up to the parents to do what they feel is best. The best thing you guys can do is be supportive. Usually hospitals have a limit to how many people can be in the room for any kind of delivery and the brother of the pregnant woman is not commonly one of those people. It would likely be fine to come see her while she's in labor and even after delivery, it's unlikely anyone would make him hold the baby, usually the nurses will do a good job cleaning up and wrapping the baby so she looks as presentable as possible. I know this is a lot of information but feel free to ask for more clarification if I can help."
"""Sales and coke are fucking best friends.  I've seen way too many people in sales on blow.  It gets you excited and pumped up.  You feel like a rockstar, you feel like you're at the fucking top.  It's a rich drug, and if you're doing it, you're doing well.""

"&gt; I just want her to put on light make up and dress nice from time to time.

If she recently got dressed up for a night out at the bar, she *is* dressing nicely from time to time, so why are you unhappy with that? Your statements seem contradictory.

You could say to your girlfriend, ""Going to the gym with you would be more fun and motivating than going alone."" But the way you asked sounded really rude. She is working 60 hours a week and shouldn't have to deal with needing to be your gym buddy. 

If she needs time alone, respect that. I don't blame her. Ask yourself this: How do you support her?"
"She's already fucking up your potential child. Isn't the fact that you think she could stop if she wanted to even more of a reason for her to abort? Because she's not stopping. Her actions are saying she doesn't care about this fetus. She's the very definition of someone unfit to be a parent right now. And frankly, so are you. When you have a kid, you put them first. You're putting your desire for a child right now above the health of that child before it is even born. She wants an abortion. She's rightfully recognized all of the above and is making the responsible choice.

And no, a second abortion will not be more complicated or hurt her fertility. That's not how it works."
"&gt; Any advice?

Run away, Simba. Run. Run away, and never return."
"You tried to soften the blow, but it back fired, the best sex you've had was with someone else. The term ""best"" doesn't really allow for qualifiers. 

You are right that it shouldn't mean that your relationship with him isn't the best relationship you've been in, but he is also right to be upset that you don't consider him to be your best/ideal sexual partner. That's a blow to the ego that isn't easy to bounce back from. 

Stop trying to qualify or describe the sex you have with him as the best if you can't honestly say that the sex you had with that other guy was worse. The more you defend that the more you are just undermining his confidence. You should try and either describe why you love him over anyone else or how to improve sex with him. "

"You shouldn't resent her wealth any more than a poor person should resent you for attending a good school and living a comfortable life because it's all relative. It sounds like she's young and doing what she thinks young people with her advantages should do. This may have more to do with the people she grew up around. You're measuring her values using a ruler scaled for your life. Focus on getting to know her and try to stop fixating on how much things cost. If you're insecure over what you could possibly offer someone in her position, or you wonder why she isn't spending the same amount on you then you may want to rethink your own values.


That being said, I don't believe her parents are doing her any favors by enabling a high-level of dependency on her family's form of ""economic outpatient care."" I would be wary of getting too serious in the relationship if they are in any way manipulative or overly controlling because one day it could mean she chooses her lifestyle over you. My general advice is to look at her parents. If her folks are down to earth then she will be too. Don't think too hard about it and focus on enjoying your time together. "
"Simply taking away the power cord first thing might be a little passive aggressive and could come across as rather rude. 

I would approach the couple and say ""Hey we bought that machine for us to use. It was really expensive and the upkeep and maintenance is expensive and intensive. We'd really appreciate if you don't use it."" If you're polite, they should back off without damaging your relationship.

If they still continue to use it after, consider moving the machine to a more private area. "

"&gt;What am I even supposed to do in this situation? I have a kid who loves her great grandma and aunty, so it's hard to just pretend they don't exist. 

Cut off your family.  Your child might love them, but they are **not** safe people.  They chose your abuser over you.  If you leave your child in their care, they'll let your abuser have access to your child.  Kids might like to play with nice shiny knives, but we don't let them do that because it's too dangerous.  Same thing for seeing toxic family members.  

Protect yourself, protect your child, stop talking to your toxic family.

"Yeah,  you celebrate ""having made it"",  when you actually ""make it"". Not on someone else's dime. "
"I guess its her sense of entitlement rather than anything else. Like ""why should I clean up after myself if someone else could do it?"" Remember, her boyfriend did it for her before they broke up. After that OP did it for her. Im sure this isn't the only thing she lets other people do for her."
"I mean. Do we have to spell this out for you?




No.  Cease contact. Honestly.  Any 23 year old who wants to meet up with a 15 year old is bad news, unless they've known each other a significant amount of time, or are family."
"I think your boyfriend absolutely *hopes* something will happen with this other woman, even if he hasn't fully internalized this idea yet. I would guess that this may be why he is getting so snappish and defensive--you are asking him to inspect his own motivations, and he doesn't want to.

I used to get into some shaaaaady relationship behavior when I was younger, and the way he is acting reminds me very much of the kind of defensiveness I would exhibit when I had a dirty little ""what if?"" idea running around in my head and got called out on it. I had MANY inappropriate ""friendships"" over the years that I tried very hard to convince myself were innocent. Inevitably, these ""friendships"" would lead to the end of my relationship and inevitably, I would end up sleeping with ""just a friend"" guy. I took pride in the fact that TECHNICALLY I never cheated. But I sure was up to some scummy behavior.

I seriously doubt that your boyf has not at least toyed with the idea of sleeping with this woman. That is why he does not want you to go. He wants the opportunity to ""bond"" with her without you there to cockblock. The fact that she was the last detail he revealed to you only confirms this suspicion to me. The fact that this neurotic planner/saver has committed to some serious international travel without having a clear idea of the budget also does not add up--he is thinking with something other than his brain here.

Additionally, she is ""maybe"" married? Really. Really, and her husband was not the one invited on this couples retreat. Sure. That makes sense."
"It's past time to stop giving in to this wet blanket.  He has been manipulating you and your DH way too long.

Tell him that you and your friends are going to the brewery.  If he and wife don't want to go, then you'll see them another time.

I can only imagine how much more entitled this couple may be when they have a child, and may expect everyone to work around their kid's naptime etc."
"Yup. 

Check your laptop for a keylogger, change all your passwords, immediately block him from all your social media + email. If OP lets him an avenue to contact her, he might be able manipulate her into coming back. DON'T let him. "
Or this would be something OP could volunteer his time to do for her.
"&gt;He's also refusing to pay 20% of his income in child support because he feels that I don't need it.

"I don't think you should try to make any kind of relationship work with this woman. 

You were polite even after that blowup. You spoke to her in public multiple times and were met cold shouldered, even while she was out with your father! If she really wanted a relationship she could've taken steps then instead of waiting to attack you in private. Little things like that would've shown that she actually wants to make it work, instead of trying to guilt you with attacks on your character. 

If you're still comfortable with it, let her and your father come to the wedding (although he should be ashamed for letting her speak to you that way). But don't feel pressured into having her go dress shopping with you or any other activities. You deserve to have a good time and low stress leading up to your wedding, it's not your responsibility to forge a bond or make HER feel excited for you."
"If the bartender mentioned to me my date was staring at another chick, I would be fukin mortified. That's such a slap IMO.

"You left a pair of ""very valuable and sentimental"" earrings in his truck? And you had plenty of opportunities to pick them up, but you ""didn't think about it""?  

Sorry, this is entirely on you. They were your responsibility, and a truck is not a safe place for small precious pieces of jewellery. You should have either kept them in your handbag or in your ears, or should have put them in an inner pocket of your boyfriend's jacket (and only for a few hours at most).

Do you *want* to breastfeed? I tried it  at first and it made me resent my child. I needed my body back and to not be solely responsible for her nutrition.

"OH GOD NO ahahaha. He works in the software development industry.

It's also pretty insulting that they want to dictate their grandfather's life without actually spending anytime with him in it. 

Ask them to outline what exactly they think is going to go wrong in at the ACE store that they feel the need to immediately take away one of his favorite activities. Do they know what his actually job duties are? Have they actually gone to the store to see what the enviroment is like? I sincerly doubt his boss is making him stock paint gallons. There might be room for a compromise here where the grandchildren make a list of work duties they find to be too risky, so they can feel better about his job. 

It sounds like you know more about your Grandpa's day to day life and you should call them out on that.

You slipped up in a perfectly reasonable way, and he fucked it all up in completely unreasonable ways! His reaction is not okay. At all. This is straight up abusive behaviour and suggests your boyfriend is incapable of handling his own negative emotions without shutting down, and then lashing out at you later. If your boyfriend is experiencing this much anxiety and discomfort about your expressing a concern at a restaurant, he needs mental health treatment. 

He needs mental health treatment, and you should seriously consider dumping him because you shouldn't have to live in fear of this behaviour. Even if you were in the wrong to complain on his behalf, his reaction was completely and utterly out of whack with your mistake. You stepped on his toe. He ran you over with his truck. The intensity of his reaction was unjustified and very concerning."

"I fully agree. I reinforced all those points when we spoke, mostly along the lines of ""I'm sorry if my reaction wasn't what you hoped, but I will never apologize for my feelings."" 

This also isn't the first time I've felt that ""money"" has been a sort of convenient excuse not to do something with me that he did with others. One of the reasons he's so hard for finance now is because he used to spend lavishly on a former girlfriend (dates every night, putting his card on her Uber, possibly yacht trips or something? idk). Obviously, I would NEVER want/expect/ask him to spend that kind of money on me - I'd rather have a financially stable long term partner. But sometimes it does make me feel badly that he would buy her roses and take her on lavish dates when he's ""too broke"" to go out to dinner with me so we stay in, make a pizza, and watch Netflix (every damn weekend.)

This Iceland trip with Kevin has brought up a lot of those feelings again. It feels like the common denominator is me. Why are experiences with Ex GF and Kevin worth spending money on, but not ones with me?

"Yeah. It's great that so many people are trying to comfort OP and give her more balanced info, but it is kinda fucked that her boyfriend isn't taking her concerns more seriously. He sounds locked onto the idea of four kids at the exclusion of all else, including consideration of the pain, physical changes, medical risks, and emotional stress that he is flippantly expecting OP to endure for him and his dream family.

OP, I think it's great that you're going to talk to some health professionals and birthing experts to learn more and (potentially) assuage your fears, but I really think you should insist on your boyfriend participating in this fact finding with you. He doesn't seem to have a clear idea of what he's asking of you, and could probably stand to get a bit of a wake up call in that department."

""this is why she doesn't date and how she'll be single until death because who could love and accept her and her child""

I am getting the feeling that she thinks that it will be too difficult to integrate a new partner into her home and family life.  Sad, I am sure she really likes you, she's overwhelmed and probably feels guilty both for putting you through the behaviors and for upsetting her son with a new situation.  I read that statement as throwing in the towel on the relationship, especially when you combine it with the ghosting.  Understandable I suppose, her son has to come first, but also terribly, terribly sad.

"Yeah I was on the other end of this.  Used my roommate's espresso machine (not a $500 one)  he asked me not to.  I told him he needs to put it in a cabinet when he isn't using it then, we don't have enough counter space for each of us to all leave out our individual appliances."
"Preferring or existing in a neutral emotional state is definitely personality trait. I'm definitely that way, in fact I have little to no emotional fluctuation throughout the day. 

Trying to bring other people down because they're happy and he's not isn't just preferring to be neutral though. I think he needs to explore why other people's emotional states cause him to react in that way, if he was truely content to be neutral he wouldn't feel the need to pull people down. "

"Is there any written law, that your sister must be able to spend time with your daughter? Sounds like she is pretty egocentric, I mean ""she doesn't have to talk to you if she doesn't want to"" and ""you are using your daughter as pawn against her"". The world doesn't revolve around her. Your sister sounds like the kind of person I wouldn't want my children to have as role model"
"I feel particularly frustrated because I ultimately am supporting his decision to go. I know he's been unhappy and lonely (he lives far from his hometown, where Kevin lives, and has been homesick), so I'm excited that he has this trip. But I am also sad that a trip with me didn't invoke that kind of excitement."
"I guess I just can't understand this mindset. I mean, you said he knew that your income alone could not sustain you, you even had to borrow money, and still he was cool with not having a job? I just don't get it.

My husband got laid off. He took 2 - 3 weeks to mope and play video games, then got off his ass and got to work. We were in a position financially for him to be picky about his job but we both agreed if it came down to it, he would flip burgers even with his master's degree. 

I can get being angry, he was putting forth no effort while you went to work every day. I can get him being defensive the first or second time you approached him. I can't get him watching you leave for work every day, watching the bills pile up, watching you borrow money, and sit back and think *this is fine, yep, just fine*.

But, Oh shit, not the **car**!"
"She's cutting off contact with you. So to continue your friendship, as it is, isn't an option. So when you say ""it wouldn't make sense to cross that line now"", it almost looks like crossing the line is the only way to preserve that relationship. The only alternative (the one that would ""make sense"") is cut off all contact, which seems super miserable. Giving a romantic relationship a shot seems like it would be merciful for both of you - it would be easier to remain friends after that, if things didn't work out."
The main problem I'm having in regards to discussing therapy is that he's tried it with no success concerning this issue in the past. If I try to talk to him about shopping around to find a better fit I can almost literally see his eyes glaze over. 
"Not at all, man. She's lying to you, does not care about your feelings, and pretty much emotionally cheating on you. 

If she does not block and stop this, this will kill you guys. "
"Yeah, I get the feeling he's lived a fairly consequence-free existence while married. "
I'm YELLING!! what a plot twist this would be
"I had so much anxiety too about dating one of my closest friends. He asked me out and I did not know what to do because I thought if it didn't work out our friendship would be ruined. It ended up being the best decision of my life saying yes, we're so in love. And I'm telling you, being in love with your best friend is different than being in love with someone you met and immediately started dating. 

IT IS WORTH THE RISK. 

Also, the fact you've recently been texting more is a huge sign he is also interested. I mean, come on, if he wasn't interested, why would he have the need or even bother replying to you all day long every day?

You got this :)"
"You have several options:

1.  Report the theft to the police and don't worry what happens.  Your mother is a thief and needs to suffer the consequences.

2.  You have confronted her - make sure she refunds the money.  Then change the credit card - get a new card and and a new pin.

3.  If you don't want to do anything to your mother, then call the credit card company and say that you lost your card.  They will send you a new card and make sure you get a new pin.  You will still be responsible for the debt but at least your mom wont be able to run up any more debt.

Also, get rid of the belief that you owe her anything for bringing her into the world or raising you.  That was her choice and her responsibility.  Children do not owe their parents for raising them.  What she did was theft - plain and simple.

"That's exactly how we invite them out! My husband started a group text with them and said ""Hey guys we'll be in town Friday, we're going to the brewery just wanted to see if you're around and wanted to join"" and Jay responded ""just because there will only be water and the food truck for my wife, any interest in x or x, I know they have more than beer"".  
I responded that we had also invited other people he said ""oh well if all else fails we can try to make it to brewery, but x place is better than brewery since all brewery has is water for my wife""  
I know my husband wants to accommodate them, and I actually would like to check out this place, but it makes me so annoyed that it's because Jay is always trying to change the plans "
"I have a few hoarders in the family, resulting from a similarly chaotic childhood, and I know from experience how untrue it is that they're lazy. I think if people realized how much time and effort was devoted to growing, maintaining, protecting, and hiding a hoard, they'd realize that nothing could be further from the truth. It is a literal manifestation of someone's fear, shame and inner turmoil. 

I think it would help him get a better picture of what's going on with you if he understood the trauma and deprivation that led to it. That's super hard to relive and speak aloud to the face of another human being whose opinion you care a lot about. So I'd recommend you write him a letter. 

In your letter, you should talk about the experiences you had as a child -- sleeping on the floor, being hungry while your siblings ate,  giving up any good thing that you earned -- and what that taught you about the value of things and your own value. You didn't have your toys taken away to punish you for being a bad child, you had them taken away because it was your role in life to have them taken away, and what you wanted or needed or felt you deserved was irrelevant. In a way, it's kind of beautiful that you refused to internalize your assigned role, albeit in an unhealthy way.  

Then draw a line to how those experiences affected your behavior now. If you're taught that you're not important enough to have things, it's not a far leap to believe that having things is proof that you *are* important. Objectively, you know that Taco Bell receipt from 2015 is worthless and you don't even want it, but parting with it is all tied up in your sense of self-worth, the sadness and pain of your childhood, and the shame you feel at not having just thrown it out already. 

And then, after you've talked about your past and your present, give him (and yourself) a ray of hope about the future. Tell him that you know your behavior is unhealthy, you want to get better, and you're working on it. Then tell him how you plan to do it -- therapy, meds, a professional organizer, whatever. Basically, the letter should be cause&gt;effect&gt;solution. 

Then give him the letter, e-mail it, read it to him, whatever, and let him process it. And work from there. I think he cares about you and how you feel (or else he would not have helped you clean after you cried), and so I think he'll be willing to work with you. He may not be, and you'll have to accept that, as painful as it may be. In the long run, it's better for you to be upfront now. There's a lot of hiding and shame in hoarding, and it's only going to be worse if you spend the rest of your relationship that way while he continues to build resentment about what he sees as weakness of character. 

For all that, he is probably not the right person to support you while you declutter. Cleaning for him is not a big deal, nor is it a big deal for you when you clean other people's things. But you cleaning your own things is a big deal. You're dealing with heavy stuff. It's like an anorexic eating -- they're going through so many feelings doing something that the rest of us don't even think about. To support them while they work through that takes an incredible amount of patience and understanding, more than most people have, frankly. Even when you know they're suffering, you reach a point where you just want to scream ""Eat the damn sandwich, already!"" So even if bf can accept that you're not lazy, I don't think he'll be able to understand the overwhelming anxiety of throwing things away. And that's okay! Some needs are too big to be filled by one person. I learned from my own experience that it's better to pick a partner that suits your best qualities than your worst qualities.  It's fair, though, if he decides to stay, to expect him to be patient and reserve judgement on your clutter, as long as you're working on getting better.  "
"The woman was being abusive and disruptive. The owner should have handled it sooner but he didn't, so your boyfriend stepped in. You guys were enjoying a nice dinner, she should have been the one to leave, you guys should not be expected to get up and end the meal prematurely because of her and your boyfriend knew it.

If you're an unconfrontational person that is your prerogative but not everyone is built that way. You cannot choose when your boyfriend gets to speak up about something. He's a grown man, he's allowed to voice his opinion. He didn't start it, he didn't put his hands on her, he simply told her off after she bothered everyone.

Let him be his own person. You don't have to agree with all his choices to respect his right to make them. You're overreacting and making this all about you."
"I'd straight up ask them ""were you this rude to John too?""

"I wouldn't define that as ""misogyny"". Just plain ol' jealousy.

I think you're doing him a disservice by labeling it so as well. If the sexes were reversed, girl-Tom could still have those thoughts. It's not women he has a problem with, it's being romantically invested in someone.

And he's doing his best to work through it and so far he hasn't made it your problem."
" &gt; ""well since you sent me that message, I wasn't going to tell you this but I was going to meet him tomorrow after work"" she has since deleted her messages with him and I suspect (glimpsed at her phone) she has talked to him again already.

Trickle truth. Not a good sign.

 &gt; I am pretty sure she will begin talking to him again, and even delete her messages. I really don't believe otherwise. Will she ever cheat?

She said she would go out with him if she could, has copped to her friend that cheating is something she would actively lie about, is deleting her conversations with this guy, and by ""taboo pictures"" I assume you mean he's sexting her.

How much more shady shit do you need? She's having an affair or she's going to."
"You'll probably get a variety of responses here - personally I think it's a movie, real life continues after you finish watching it, and no-one's disrespected because *no-one who fought was there*. What, you're meant to have a 2 minute silence after leaving the cinema as a memorial? There's an argument to be made that the subject matter should be treated with respect depending on context, but even that's debateable, and as you say, you weren't making fun of the movie, you just weren't somber.

So I'd say her reaction is unreasonable. She might have felt personally very moved by the film, and that's fine, but she doesn't get to impose her standards or expectations onto other people. How well do you know this woman? Because I'd be amazed if a reaction like this was a one-off - keep an eye out if you end up dating her."
"Well just draw a hard line about any more father talks. This is a boundary you're entitled to. He can sort out these feelings on his own, or he can sort them out with a professional, but you've reached the limit of how much you can actually help and you're not going to discuss it with him anymore. 

Tell him this when you're both calm and he's not currently obsessing over dad. Be patient, be compassionate, let him know that the next time he works himself into a lather about this that you'll politely leave the room until he's calmed down. That you sympathize but that this cycle isn't good for either of you. "
"1. he kept pushing a fetish long after you said NO

2. six years meant nothing because he jumped to the worst possible explanation

"I feel like it's important to point out that the responses to his aggressive questions you've said you do here seem, to him or others, to be either joking with him or being irritated by him. Whereas I think the original commenter was going for a more aloof, slightly baffled, ""why are you wasting our time with this?"" sort of reaction.  

This may be just how I read your reaction vs their proposed one, but I think the distinction here is important; you don't want him to think you're buddies or enemies, you want him to leave you tf alone. The best way to achieve that is a sort of aloof, slightly puzzled and definitely 'above their games' sort of response. If they sense that from you, they'll leave you alone because there isn't any fun or game in provoking the unprovokable. 

For example with the elavator thing (so creepy, btw!) It may have helped to be rifling through your desk when he followed you back and hovered, and then look up well after you've noticed he's there (make him wait hes not that important) and ask with a faint smile if he needs something. That would force him to explain his behavior, and if he can explain it away, it will likely be a pretty flimsy explanation--seeming puzzled by it (again, why is he wasting both of your time?) and acquisisting is the quickest way to make him get bored and leave you alone. 

Obvioisly, despite these tips, he may keep bothering you. Only you can decide if it's troublesome enough to take to your superiors, and if you do, document everything and be sure you choose your timing well. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this Op, I wish you the best!"
"Sounds like wishful thinking. You're reading way too much into this. The only reason to tell your recent ex who isn't over you you're on a date is to make them jealous,or hurt them

Even if she were interested, it wouldnt last. she'd basically using you as a safe backup until something more interesting comes along. She's just using you for attention as an ego boost.

"As a waitress this is what I would like to someone to go about it. First I would casual bring up if she has a bf, and please dont ask her co-workers it starts drama. Then I would causally bring up something you would like to do, and causally ask her to come along. She might be treating you special because your a regular, or she might like you. I would say ""Hey remember that xxx movie we talked about at xxx, they are having a showing next week. Would you like to come with me, my treat?"" If she turns your down gently, and d oesnt give you a number or try to make other plans at some time. Then move on."
"To be honest, I'm really afraid to leave her because where I live doesn't have a very big LGBT community, and aside from this issue, she is pretty much perfect. She is really nice, into a lot of the same things I am, very attractive and fit, and into all the same kinks I am, which is hard to find, especially when you're gay. But I know you're right though. I'm just hoping there is some compromise I can come to with her. "
Get those divorce papers. Get them served to him the moment he steps into the country. Also try file a restraining order? Gather your proof he has had no input into your lives for years. See your lawyer. Get prepared. Does your daughter have a  insurance payout on death? If you're still married it might be split between the parents. Be ready to call the police. Go see the police first and explain. Do what you have to do.

"Uh-oh.

 Ok, I'm going to be the one to say this/ask this:  are you aware that in the US, not sure about Canada, that there is a comedic stereotype of Japanese people constantly clicking pics wherever they go?  It's been around for decades, since long before cell phones and digital media. 

I really hope that is not part of the issue here, but I feel like maybe it's worth mentioning, because if there is any truth to that, then they can all doubly fuck off. "

""It was incredibly disrespectful for you to involve third parties in our relationship, and it makes me question the strength of our relationship.""

&gt; She has been yelling at me and pressuring me to take this job. 

""It is extremely disrespectful for you to be emotionally abusive to me, and refuse to understand my viewpoint. You are essentially asking for me to be a slave and absent partner. That is not only grossly unfair unless you are also planning on finding a 100hr job, but that is not the future I want -- if it's the future you want, then we are incompatible.""

&gt; I don't know if I am making the right decision. 

Dude, holy shit yes you're making the right decision. Unless you guys are being chased by the mob to pay off bills, or are forced to buy homes in dubai or innercity London, there is no need whatsoever to take this job.

I'd give your GF one come-to-Jesus talk, one chance to acknowledge that she *massively* fucked up by pressuring you on this, and then say ""okay, good luck finding a guy who *does* want this job, bye.""

Seriously. You manage to have a six-figure, 45 hr week job, are in shape, and are emotionally mature? You should be able to replace her with someone who doesn't see you as a wage slave before the end of the week."

"Hey man, welcome to the shit hole. It's gonna get hard and you're going to be sad.

What will happen next: 

1. You will break down at the worst times. Including at work. Find a trusted coworker to lean on that will have your back. Take mental health days. 

2. You will try to rationalize this and keep coming back to it being your fault. You're wrong. Stop. Every relationship has its faults. You will begin to see the cracks when you look and you will blame yourself. Do not. You would have patched them. She say a hairline crack in the corner of the driveway and decided to re-asphalt immediately. 

3. You are going to grow a lot. You are going to hit 2 really hard extremes. Intensely emotional and numb. Fight both. Find that middle ground. That's where you want to be.

4. Get a fucking therapist. Yes, lean on friends. Yes, lean on family. They are great but a therapist is an unbiased 3rd party that's job is your best interest and can keep your actual mental health in check. You need that pulse check on your mental health. If you start to slip, they can help you see it. Friends and family encourage you and will want you to grow. Sometimes you need someone who is checking the list to make sure you're not falling. 

5. Don't. Get. Drinky. I've never touched alcohol myself but the denotation to crutch on it is going to be huge. But don't. Take this as the one time you should be somewhat sober. Enjoy a few but never ""use"" alcohol as anything other than hanging out. 

6. You now have the opportunity to live for yourself. You get to build a you. That you that you always said you'd be? Guess what? You get to be that you now. All of these great things you think she brought to you, she did in some degree. But you were the one that made the sun brighter, she just helped. Now that you've seen what life can be, you have the opportunity to make that without the aid of someone else. And you will, because that is what this new journey is about. 

7. I get the house thing. Just decide if you want it or you want to sell it. Commit. Be done with it.

I'm terrible at advice. I'm dumb as hell. I'm still going through my own journey. I'm here to talk. I'm here to throw love at you. I'm excited to see you become a crazy strong person. You are worth so much. I'm sorry this happened but I'm not sorry for who you will become. Reach out if you need anything. 

Sending love your way, brudda. "

...but there isn't a third kid. You've created this *concept* by projecting your feelings about your current, real children onto this *imagined, potential* third child, and **that's not real!** 

Let's say you took European vacations the last two summers. Each time, you got a tan, and had great adventures. Come the spring, you're thinking about next summer, and imagining hiking in Ireland or swimming on the French Rivera, when your wife says ""Honey, we can't afford a vacation this summer"". Are you upset? Of course you are, you had *expectations* and *hopes* and *fantasies* about this trip! Does that mean your wife is ""destroying"" your tan, or that your fantasies of swimming in the French Rivera are gone forever? **No**, you asshat! It means your summer is going to be different than expected, and maybe next year you'll go, or maybe you won't, but the future isn't a guarantee or a promise.

"I know this story sounds odd, and I wondered if people might think  your bf is just being crazy, so I want to share my own story real quick.

Your bf's father sounds somewhat similar to my own. My dad isn't very chatty with me or my younger brother, and certainly not with my mom. Then my older half-brother meets his wife. She's older than him but still younger than my parents, not bad looking, very outgoing. My dad takes to her like a boy with a crush. Suddenly, my sullen, aloof dad is chatting this woman's ear off, inviting her on family outings that he normally barely attends himself, etc. We'd go to like, the zoo, and my dad would walk next to her and chat. My brother would sort of just tag along. My mom would get left in the dust. I took it upon myself to stay with my mom to keep her company, because I felt bad for her.

It was inappropriate and hurtful because during outings without her, he'd revert back to his usual nasty self. We definitely felt like chopped liver and the end result was a huge blowout that ripped the family apart until they reunited for my wedding roughly 15 years later...

You noted that the father's behavior changed when your bf showed up. Then you go on to say you think the man was just being polite and your bf is obsessing. I don't think it's so crazy that he was happy to have a young woman to talk to; I don't mean to say he's going to make any moves on you but it's really not so crazy that he enjoyed the attention. This is something he clearly doesn't care to engage in with his own son. I don't know how to help him, there's clearly a painful history there that you don't seem to know yourself, but I can say that ignoring the possibility that he knows his dad's behavior better than you is likely doing the opposite. For people who grow up with parents that behave in strange, hurtful ways, it can be frustrating having someone tell you that you don't think X or Y is happening."

"I'm sorry, OP, it must really suck to have lost these earrings.

I think you're placing some of those ""this SUCKS""- feelings about losing your jewelry onto your boyfriend. That's understandable, it can feel nice to blame someone else for bad things happening, but this is not his fault.

You thought the earrings would be safe there, and you were wrong. There wasn't really anything your boyfriend could have done - you rode in the truck several times after putting them there without remembering to take them, you can't expect him to have remembered them when you didn't.

I really am sorry that you lost something with sentimental value, OP. But don't let this sour your relationship.

"Thanks. She has a few. My younger brother too, my dad, her mom's dad, and her mom's brother. I am biased so I will definitely agree that I am her favorite ;)"
"&gt;She invited me back to her place and I really don't know what got into me but I went

Oh please.

&gt;I thought I could just put this behind me and be the best boyfriend that my girlfriend deserves

The best boyfriend your girlfriend deserves would tell her what he did, so that's another lie. This is embarrassing.

&gt;But the problem is that Brittany is crazy

Of course. Britney is crazy. That's definitely the problem here. Not that you cheated, but that the woman you cheated with is ""crazy."" As we all know, sane women are ecstatic to learn that they're the side chick to some scumbag and actually get a strong sense of fulfillment out of acting as his wingman and preserving the relationship with his girlfriend. LOL.

Break up with your girlfriend and don't date anyone else until you figure out why you make such terrible choices and can't be honest with yourself about them. "
"You have a few things to weigh here. If you had known back then that he cheated on you (seriously, a *few months* after his vows), what would you have done? And he said him cheating was an impulsive ""out of my system"" thing- why was cheating in his system in the first place? I do not think his reasoning is enough. He needs to reflect more and tell you exactly why it is he cheated on you, or else you can't be sure he won't do it again. What if the impulse gets ""in his system"" again? Sure, he's felt regret and shame now, but in the future, if you choose to move forward with him, what's stopping him from doing it again? 

This is someone who can selfishly keep a secret from you *for years* because he was scared of the consequences. Think long and hard if this is the man you want to have children with. It can absolutely work out, but he has a lot of ground to cover, especially because he left such a huge gap between when he did it and telling you. Consider that maybe he waited so long so he can appease his guilt now when you're possibly too committed and invested to divorce him. He needs to answer a lot of questions. Don't let it go until you are satisfied."
"&gt;I saw him calling Maria over to him in the hot tub, pulling her onto his lap, and then I'm almost positive I saw his face on her neck and his hand fondle one of her breasts. Maria's boyfriend Sean was not looking their way at the time. Maria moved away immediately after this happened.

That is pretty fucked up, OP, and I'm really sorry you're in this situation. Being drunk is not an excuse for that behavior, and it was completely unacceptable. 

What is problematic is his response - you are (understandably) upset, and he is reacting in a way that is not acceptable. I would argue than him pulling a woman who isn't his husband or child onto his lap without his wife's consent is not okay. 

You need to have a calm, sober discussion about this, and go from there. "
"While I agree that visiting a medical professional is the next step - and I am certainly not one (though I have worked in the mental health field, so I'm not *completely* speculating) - the general symptomatology prominently featuring delusions (communicating with animals and the Capgras-like symptoms you're referring to) and possible hallucinations mixed with negative symptoms like attention span impairments **strongly** suggests schizophrenia to me. A neurologist would not be able to diagnose from a physical scan of the brain at this stage in her life. 

I'm not saying that you're wrong or off-base, but generally, when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras. A neurologist may very well be the next step in her treatment, but it's impossible to say until a professional can assess her in-person. 

OP, you should gently suggest that your girlfriend should talk to a doctor about some of her frightening experiences - immediately - as the *general* trend with psychotic disorders is that they will become worse if left untreated. She has described distress around parasites and you've noticed her forgetting - these are symptoms that you can discuss with her that are less likely to immediately lead to a persecutory-delusion-based fear of ""they think I'm crazy"".

Familiarize yourself with some of the laws around mental health in your area (especially surrounding involuntary commitment, which may become an unfortunate necessity) and find resources like a mental health crisis line that you can use if needed. "
"&gt;I've already talked to our other friends that we've invited out and they all like the other place Jay suggested and are fine with changing,

"I disagree. Emma picked it up too, and it's *her* friends. She should stand up for him first. If she wants to move on she should take care of the issue by either talking her friends out of it for good or changing friends. She can't forever be passive because she's hurting. She is still living and *leading* her life.

And to be frank, personally I would not be friend with people who judge the value of a person by the car they are driving. Your friends tell a lot about the kind of person you are, so I wonder how is Emma in real life, what's her personality like... 

She should sort her friends out, and not just for him."
"I mean, the only real issue is age gap. Aside from that you brought up

*  Whether or not you get married isn't a factor in your decision

It seems like you have plenty of reasons why you think it's time to have a kid, but didn't bother listing any of the reservations you seem to have.

Talk to your boyfriend. Have a frank discussion about the impact of having a child *right now*."

"Honestly, hoarding much like addictions is usually met with cry's of just try harder.  The odds of your boyfriend being able to deal with this at his age are slim to none.  Stop asking him for help.

Reach out to your therapist instead.  Explain how bad this is.  Ask for help.  Get on medication.  Sometimes there are services available that are aware of hoarding being an anxiety issue and treat it as mental health support services.

"I recently got out of an emotional abusive relationship. Nobody knew about what was going on until the day I called my best friend and parents and explained the situation. I never knew I could pack so fast in my life. My parents were almost immediately there to.my surprise to pick me up and my best friend was there afterwards so that we could, that same day, go buy me a ps4 so I could distract myself and get over the situation.

I never expect such a response and even the other day I texted my bff telling her how much I love her and how thankful I was. She said she feels the same ( the same happened to her a few yrs back and me and some friends helped her move)

Thank you to you as well for helping your friend!"
"We've never had such a rift in the family before. I think it is freaking out my sister, since my mom's birthday is coming up and she just wants everyone to get along. I've told her I am more than willing to hang out and be nice and chill. I answer the phone, I drive 2 hours to visit when expected, I don't miss a birthday or holiday. I will never bring hostility to my parents' home because I respect them. But they need to divert their attention to the person who is the source of aggression."
"&gt;his friend was astonished when I mentioned my age and said she thought I was an older teenager 

That is not good. I too have a baby face, but none of my BF's friends were surprised when they found out how old I was, because my BF doesn't date teenagers. It worries me that his friends thought you were actually a teen.

Do not trust that your ex has changed until he has at least a year of sobriety and honest self work under his belt.  He probably has all the best intentions of quitting drugs and treating you right, but it's all too easy to lapse back into using.

"He's not going to get sideways hints. It's uncomfortable for you, but the kindest way is to be direct. He can handle direct.

It's unkind to try to give him hints using social cues that he probably hasn't learned. "
"You aren't betraying your biomom. In fact, she should be thankful to your stepmom for giving you such a good life. Your biomom doesn't sound like a good person, tbh. 

I'd contact her, if only to tell her that you still love and miss her. Losing step kids is the hardest part of divorcing a parent. I raised my stepson from a toddler to a teen, and I miss him every day.  It would make my month to get a  message from him 

Given your family dynamics, you'll want to find a way to contact her without your mom or brother finding out. I'd make a secret fb that's only  used for communication between you. Use a stock image as a profile pic to prevent identification by mutual acquaintances, at least until you are no longer dependent on your mom."
"On the nose. He claims it's abhorrent, but his attitude is very casual and apathetic. 

And if, before this job, he would have reacted with visible revulsion?  Yeah his wife has reason to worry, because he now sees cheating as normal and not a big deal. Not a big jump to him deciding to try it.

"You need to end it with this woman. Don't give her dating advice, don't tell her she's not being realistic (because you really can't tell--I am average looking and have dated some excruciatingly hot people, so you really can't go by appearances on that), don't get involved in her dramatic attempts to find a forever love, and definitely don't give in to her attempt to make you into that forever love.

She gave you the same sex you gave her--neither of you is obligated to do shit, and I'd tell her the same thing if you were the one pressuring her to have a relationship. There's no obligation to honour here except the obligation to be honest with each other.

Just tell her that you've had a good time but your arrangement is clearly interfering with her ability to find what she wants in life, and you think it's best that you end things. Wish her well but be firm. In the end, this is the best thing for both of you."

"I have no advice because this same exact thing happens to me, and no matter what I have tried, people keep treating me like an idiot. At one of my old jobs, my nickname was Dingbat. I am objectively not a dingbat...I also graduated with honors (double-majored!) and have held down jobs and taken care of myself pretty well. I was also treated this way by a friend who got married (another bridesmaid bitched at me for showing up late to the hair appointment even though I was 30 minutes early...the stylist took too long to do my hair but everyone assumed it was my fault because they see me as unreliable). At my current job, my boss keeps making comments about how I always make the same mistakes and don't do anything, and when I asked him to elaborate because I felt that I always get my work done and that I only make mistakes when I'm learning how to do something new, which is how humans learn stuff, he admitted I do get my work done before the deadlines and that maybe I don't make the same mistakes repeatedly (but he still treats me like I'm stupid). -____-

"I think he grasps your financial situation enough. You make more than him so he EXPECTS you to pay.


I make 3x what my bf makes. Except the difference is that mine never assumes I'm paying. He never makes those sort of uncomfortable comments. In fact we recently had a discussion where I tried to tell him it was okay to let me know if he wanted to go out and do something date-y, even if he couldnt afford it (within reason obviously). Mainly because I don't want to always have to be the one to plan shit. And I have no problem telling him that's not within my budget. But he is extremely uncomfortable with that because he doesn't like deciding things with my money or whatever. He understands how frugal I am (tryna save up and retire early) and that I do pay most of the bills (he contributes his %). So when I say I can't afford it (though I guess technically I can...) He understands that what I mean is it's not within my budget.

I don't really have any advice. Just wanted to share my perspective. I know if I were in your shoes, I'd be having none of that shit. Not even just jokes about spending my money.   I guess just try to have a serious conversation about how you have a set budget and you don't appreciate when he assumes youre paying for things or makes those sort of jokes. And just try to stress the importance and seriousness of this (without threatening to split). But it doesn't sound like it's going to change to be honest."

Yeah, right.

So the next time she asks.. I'm going to say.. ""I was starting to wonder about your memory because you ask every single time knowing I can't have it.  It made so much sense when you said it was your manners.. but really.. I'm fine not being asked.""

Try that with him.  It's being politely assertive back at him.

""Oh man Kent.. this is the 6th time you've asked me in 3 hours.  I'm starting to wonder if you need a referral to a neurologist!""

He's expecting to make you uncomfortable and watch you hurry past him.  This will catch him offguard.  

Follow up with.. ""I realize it must be very distracting to have to feel like you need to speak every time I'm headed to do something so feel free to do the nod instead.  It'll help us both stay more focused.""  

Edit to add:

Or would you rather just make sure you ended up with a good person and a supportive partner? I bet you your girlfriend feels the same way as you. She's not looking for someone to pay for her vacations, she's looking for someone that treats her well and is fun to hang out with.

Now let's go back to that money comparison. You're dating someone making 30k, and you make 100k. Would you pay a larger share of vacations to make sure you both had a good time? I bet you would. I know it is going to be extremely weird having your girlfriend drop thousands of dollars on you on a trip to Europe or wherever, but realize she views money as a non-factor in every situation. It's not bad, it's just different. People like you or me will never be able to quite fathom that, but you shouldn't let it hold you back. Get past your mental block, because that's all this is, and just enjoy hanging out with a girl you clearly like"

You are both being dishonest and you both cheated. This is not a great foundation for a relationship. IME, people who cheat lack some fundamental self-respect. If you gave your word and it's important to you, you grow a backbone and tell your SO ""this isn't working"" instead of fucking someone else in secret for months on end.

"Does the extended family understand that this is now your sister's full-time home, or do they think she's doing grandpa a favor by staying there &amp; taking care of some things?

"See things like that make the ex's message a bit more credible, as does this from your post:

That's not to say that there are no crazy psycho ex girlfriends (read this sub long enough and you will find plenty), but that between her message and your description, he matches an awful lot of the flags of a potential abuser in that he is moving the relationship quickly (to try and get you invested more quickly), attempts to blame the failure of his previous relationship on a ""crazy"" former partner (this one is a bit hard, as there are always two sides to a breakup and it can be difficult to tell who is being truthful), and your indications that he has anger issues (aggressive/insulting statements when on xanax).

If she telling the truth? Probably, at least from my reading. Whether you break up with your bf now is up to you, but know that if he does start escalating abusive behaviors, you need to leave immediately. No second chances, no blame on you for any of it. Because if he's abusive, he will try and twist it as your fault, and he will lie, threaten, or otherwise try to make you feel like you can't leave."

"Since it is wicked kind of her to give free childcare, and I'm a conflict adverse shithead, if I were you, I would plan some kind of outing with another friend with kids, or something like that on a Tuesday or Thursday.  Some excuse where you need to leave the house with your kid shortly after getting home from work.

So that day you could be like ""I'm so sorry to snag my daughter and run, but we've got plans to meet some friends for dinner, so we're going to have to head out of here at 4.""  Do that a couple weeks in a row, so you can get in a routine of ""OMG thanks so much time to go now"", and then just transition into ""Well, thanks so much it was so good to see you.  We still on for this weekend?"" or whatever pleasantries are normal for you when 4PM starts to roll around.  Then you're in a routine where you get your house to yourself on at least one day a week, and the others feel less bad!

Also, maybe do less ""we all hang out with your mom on the weekend"" and do more ""your husband and kid hang out with your mom on the weekend while you take some time to yourself"" so he can do some of the emotional work of maintaining that relationship and make this less like you have to entertain all the time."

I say probably do it.  A lifelong appearance is more important than any 17M. BFs come and go (esp. at 17!) but your face is gonna stick around. But do wait a year or so anyway. At 18 your face hasn't really settled into its final form. (Of course I dont know how bad it is...)

if he doesnt support you in becoming the person you want to be, he's not ""the one"". Bear that in mind in future (""Oh no you should not go to THAT college because then we wont be together"" etc)


(BTW: a *lot* of men DO find big noses sexy on a woman. It keeps coming up in r/askreddit threads ""what unconventional feature do you find hot?"") "
"This is the best response here. u/relationshipthrow08 really ought to have his wife read these comments. She has a passion but that passion has harmed her interpersonal relationships with her arrogance and inability to let go of the situation.

Kinda proud of the cousin and his wife for setting such strong ""don't-fuck-with-u"" boundaries, actually. They are 100% right to do so."
"&gt;I like how OP being 17 means she is inexperienced and the relationship will probably not work out, but at the same time is perfectly capable of making a lifelong decision like surgery. Which is it?

Apples and oranges. She's had her nose for 17 years. She knows (heh) how she feels about that at this point. Does every person who gets vanity surgery love it? Of course not. But it's a much more sure bet that she'll be happy getting the surgery she's wanted for most of her life than it is that she ends up marrying her High School sweetheart.

Even if that's not the case, even if it doesn't make her happy, it's still her choice. Just like she can get a tattoo or a piercing that she may regret. Her body, her choice. If her 17 year old boyfriend doesn't like it, that's fine too. He can date someone else, and so can she."
"I have to agree. There's something else to this story, there's no way she's only upset about a photo. "
"Wedding photographer here. First off, it's fishy to me that she hasn't booked someone yet (unless they're eloping). I mean, I had someone contact me last week for their June 2019 wedding. So either your friend is not good at planning, or she's looking to save a ton of money by taking advantage of you (naively or not, I couldn't say -- sometimes people don't realize what they're asking for).

Second of all, I've been in your exact situation. Friends from college came out of the woodwork and asked if i'd photograph their ceremony and a couple family photos. 5 hours later, I was snapping away at the reception and dance, didn't get to finish dinner, didn't have any time to enjoy the wedding with friends. Got paid $200; spent it on a hotel the same night because there was a terrible blizzard and it wasn't safe to drive 50 miles home. 

Don't work for less than you're worth. It's better to learn to say ""no,"" than sell yourself short. 

""Hey [friend name], it's kind of you to think of me! Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience, and I'm not comfortable photographing your wedding. I'd be happy to connect you with some professionals I know though!""

Alternative: ""Hey [friend name], thank you for thinking of me! My hourly rate is ($$$), and that includes a second photographer, editing, etc. I'd love to meet up with you to discuss your needs."""
"Man, if ""things fizzled out a couple dates into someone I met via online dating"" merits an r/rela post, you are in for a rough time. It just sounds like she got bored or something, and it's probably not worth going crazy analyzing. Just start swiping on girls again and good luck."
"Your mother doesn't seem to care who she hurts in order to get what she wants. What's important now is to limit the damage she can do to you and your sister in the future. Rely on her as little as possible going forward as you can now see how selfish she is. You can't count on her to follow through with anything now. Know that if there comes a time when you need to break all contact with your mother for your own mental health then do it. You don't owe her anything as you can tell she has no interest in protecting your feelings, why should you protect hers? You have gone a decade without being able to see your father every day because of her crap, there's no reason you should feel guilty if she drives you away from her.

Thank your Dad for not turning you against your mother for all these years but inform him that now is the time that if you ask him to you need his support to protect yourselves from her."
That's probably part of the reason they broke up. 
"Since we're all declaring exactly how much we're paying, just declare that you're paying exactly one-quarter of the bill and not a penny more. Leave the BF and his friend to deal with her between them."
"Honestly, I think baby plans should be shelved until your husband decides whose side he is on. You don't want to have a child with him if he's going to be running to his narcissistic mother every time she beckons. "
"OP could also be subconsciously terrified of that level of connection to someone? Its one thing for you to share everything about yourself with someone. That is a good friendship.

It is another to surrender yourself emotionally to someone. That is what happens when you are in love with someone. You become vulnerable. Its weird because on one hand you may just not have any interest in that. On the other hand you might just be mentally blocking the idea of it because it is overwhelming. I dont know. 

Personally, i never thought i would find my wife. I wasnt even looking when we met. When i did though, i knew there was something. I knew in 5 minutes, from that point forward, in that if she disappeared from my life i would have lost something i could never replace, whatever that was. I couldnt muster the courage to tell her this for some time.  I think i used to tell her, ""i want us to be together for a while"". Not 'i love you', 'i like you a lot' - boy am i lucky she didnt get sick of me. Consider that for a second. If that thought doesnt stir feelings for you, my guess is, you probably dont want what she does?"
"I'm glad you resolved it so kindly.  I have an extreme fear of rodents and would have flipped out had I been the lady. No kidding, I'm shuddering just reading the post. "
I had a bad Xanax habit some years ago and it destroyed nearly all the friendships I had. Xanax doesn't affect everyone the same way. I can completely believe that someone could get angry on Xanax.
"From a doctor, the description of depending on xanax for sleep sounds very concerning.  They're highly addictive, I would be very worried if I was using them on consecutive days for instance, they should be used if you really can't sleep otherwise, not something you pop for sleep, I've seen people who can't sleep without them, and I would **never** want to be one of those people."
1000% this ^. Your husband is an ass.

"This guy doesn't seem to be messing around. And that the email included pics of you that you sent to Nick seems like pretty solid evidence for at least that one. And they may be able to corroborate internally who requested the wellness check even if they can't tell you. 

They may laugh you off, but it seems worth trying if you have the time just so there's a record. It's also their job to solve crimes so if it escalates they may want to figure out who's harassing you themselves by checking up on who called your boyfriend's employer and stuff. "

"I recently went to an MLB game where they had a ""peanut free section"". Everyone in the entire section was required to sign a waiver saying you were committed to not buying or eating peanuts at the game, it was no big deal and I think it enabled some very allergic people to attend the game safely. Is it possible that the niece could attend a game like this?

Otherwise, I personally feel like your sister's preoccupation with things being ""fair"" is only going to hold her and her daughter back. Life isn't always fair - sometimes, her allergies will hold her back - and I think it would be good for your niece to accept that. I'd encourage you to go to the game with your grandma, though it seems like you don't want to rock the boat."

"He left you guys for a month. He didn't call you and provide for his children. He left you guys with an emotionally unstable mother with no money and no idea of when he was returning. To think that your mother took him back after all this showing what kind of father he is was a mistake. 

Lupe has every right to act like she's been and I applaud her for it. You guys need to find somewhere else to live because your mother is allowing him to come back and your father is a jerk."
"Lord. You sound very over dramatic. It's been two weeks and now your dramatizing the end of your relationship because she has shit to do? She told you she has work to do. Should she ignore her job because you are feeling insecure and want to cuddle? She can cuddle when she's done. Unfortunately people sometimes have to do work outside of work. I do, and I expect my bf to have the independence to go entertain himself somewhere that's not on top of me whilst I do so. 

Btw, the manipulative tactic of running off to pout and hope she chases after you is one of THE most immature things a grown adult could do. That's what babies do... 

Just relax. It's truly not that big a deal. "
"They have drastically violated your agreement by adding a toddler to your living arrangements, so I don't think it's unreasonable for you to ask them to leave (or to find another place for the child for the next 2 months).

"And maybe if OP has a hobby or something, him and his mum can start their own bonding tradition. Uncle Douchnozzle can go suck a lemon."
"I feel like his response should be:

""Dear sister, wellwellwell is the opposite of a gold digger.  She never asks for anything and I don't spend a lot of money on her for dates or gifts through out the year so I wanted to surprise her with something nice and romantic for her birthday.  She is actually very low maintenance and you're being very disrespectful towards someone that is good for me.  

Comparing the gift I got for my neice to the one I got for my girlfriend is weird.  If you think neice would like a trip for her birthday, you as her parents, would be the best people to surprise her with that.  

I love how cute your family is and hope to have my own one day. Any perceived opinions you have regarding my change in spending habits is due to a personal choice  I've made to start saving more aggressively for my future and not really something I think we need to discuss as a family.   If you and BIL end up in need of fiancial assistance with neice, then of course let me know.""

And then shut down any and all future comments saying he's already said all there is to say on the topic. 

In general he'd be better off opening a savings account for the neice and putting $ in there instead buying gifts monthly that she clearly doesn't need more of or giving such expensive big occasion presents.  This can pay for larger things in the future that she'll actually need and remember more.        "
"As a server, it would take a lot for me to say something like that to a guest. In order to potentially impact her money-making it must have been some pretty egregious behavior."
"So according to an impartial third party who your husband advised you to consult, your husband:

* held a grudge for fifteen years
* insisted you move to an area you aren't compatible with
* has so far failed to help you get aettled
* is sabotaging your first real friendship over a fifteen year grudge
* is still an irresponsible pet owner

"1) If his little boy is getting hit by your friend's daughter, the daycare needs to intervene on that, ASAP.  Tell the director the whole situation.  Maybe they'll be able to keep the kids separate if they know what's going on. 

2) You need to tell your own daughter to stay away from that little boy. 

3) You honestly should pull this guy aside and tell him what you know about your friend so he can make the best decision for his son. He might want to pull him from the daycare to get away from your friend.  Obviously, since your friend already knows he talked to you, she should probably expect some fallout here. If she's gonna be a psycho, your friendship might not be long for this world, but would you want it to be? "
"The ratio is actually not high, in fact it's nearly even in most ""nerdy"" hobbies/interests, the problem is women who are fans tend to talk about it less because the second you open your mouth about it you get a torrential downpour of sexism and gatekeeping directed at you.

"This was my thought too.  OP clearly goes above and beyond every year, and every year her husband sets her up for failure (no suggestions, take backs on ideas, constant guesses, etc).  He must be loving all the groveling and apologizing and self blame coming out of you, so don't feel too bad about ""ruining his birthday"".  It's a bald-faced power play.

I wonder, outside of gift giving occasions, how often OP finds herself twisted into knots over ""disappointing"" her husband in some way, and how often those roles get reversed..."
"If Alli was truly remorseful about her actions, she would not have waited until her last days to apologize to your wife. Does your wife even want an apology? Would seeing this woman make her feel any sort of beneficial emotion?

Also, what does she need closure on, exactly? You had an affair a decade ago, and haven't spoken since you cut off contact. There is no ""closure"" because your relationship has been over with for a long time. 

All it will end up doing is reopen old wounds, and signal to your wife that this other woman is more important than she is."
"Agree. OP knew for a month she wanted to end it and has been playing along all this time, telling him she loved him and couldn't wait to see him again. Look at it from his perspective -- she's already agreed to him moving out there, they'd been together 8 years and are stable and planning to get married, he missed her like crazy and thought she'd be happy to get their (already agreed to) life path started a bit earlier. Sure he was a bit foolhardy, but he didn't do anything malicious or wrong. And OP treated him badly (if accidentally! It's an awkward situation) by leading him on all this time."
"&gt;  If I were in your situation this would now enter ultimatum territory

Agreed. What bothers me most is that she can't stand up for herself. She keeps taking the path of least resistance, first with Matt, then with OP, then with both. She won't stand up for herself, how can we expect her to stand up for her relationship with OP. I'd ditch her yesterday. It's not that she'll cheat, it's more that she lies to avoid conflict. Relationships are hard work and Jill sounds like she's not into shouldering any of the weight. "
"I'm a veterinarian, so euthanasia is something I deal with on a regular basis. I've also had to euthanize my own pets in the past.

It's ok to grieve the loss of Sophie. Pets are like family members for many people - myself included. There's something wholesome about them that we don't necessarily get from human companionship. It's not stupid to or silly to be sad that she's gone.

Sophie will always have a special place in your heart. The pain will ease over time. It may not seem like it now, and it may never entirely go away, but it will ease. 

Don't feel guilty about having her put to sleep. I've seen what happens when people wait too long, and its often not pretty. You were the most important person in Sophie's life and you made the best decision that you could to give her the best life possible. That is never something to regret.

"&gt;His argument is that ""it's the principle"", that he shouldn't have to stop talking to a friend who helped him through a rough patch just because I feel uncomfortable with it. 


This is so ridiculous. 

After reading your post I think you've made it clear that you would allow him to continue talking to her as long as he stopped pussyfooting around mentioning your existence.

There's no ""principle"" behind keeping a friend strung along because they have romantic feelings that he feels uncomfortable putting an end to or disrupting with a mention of his girlfriend.

There's no ""principle"" behind making you the bad guy by saying that he will only mention you to her if he clarifies at's at your own insistence. 

And there is absolutely no ""principle"" behind maintaining friendships with former romantic interests/sexual partners that rely on pretending you don't exist. 

The only valid ""principle"" is that both of you can only have friends who can acknowledge and respect your relationship. Period.

"Yeah, it's safe to say that if your sex drives aren't matching up at 6 weeks in it's not going to get better. It should come pretty naturally this early on. Nope on outta there."
"&gt; My wife doesn't think she deserves her forgiveness, as she did some things at the time to my wife that were pretty mean.

Your wife is right. The woman slept with a married man who had two toddlers.

An affair is a *huge* mistake. And it's something you'll probably need to spend a lifetime repairing. You need to continue to prioritize your wife. Do *not* put your mistress's feelings over your wife's, no matter the circumstances."
"People legitimately get cold feet at the last minute. It happens.

Here was anything but. She planned this. Removing her things, using the distraction of a wedding as cover? That's what seals it. She could have spoken with you any time before the big day, could have called things off and separated with less ado... but no. She made sure you were truly left high and dry.

You owe her nothing. Closure or otherwise. Turn your back and get on with your life - and without her."
"say ""yes"", and agree to meet with her at a certain time. then last minute say, sorry I don't feel like coming. haha

"(I'm no psychologist or child expert, but I have a lot of young cousins and nephews and worked in a mum and baby/toddler/young child centre a few years ago, so this is my advice).

It's normal. The dream is obviously for your son to run into his father's arms, but it doesn't work that way. To your son, his dad is near enough a stranger, someone he's heard about but barely seen.

It's also very normal for children that age to be scared of unfamiliar men, more so than women (I'm taking this from my experience with nephews and cousins.) One thing that I've noticed that helps is bringing the adult male down to the child's height. Have your husband crouch down when speaking to your son, or sitting no the floor, it makes him less intimidating. Have him take things very slowly. Ask your son about his interests, ask him who is his favourite power ranger or whatever he's into. Expect a lot of silence at first, maybe nodding or shaking his head. But make sure your husband keeps talking and asking, even if your child doesn't reply. He will warm up.

Also little presents help! This advice maybe a bit biased because I'm an aunt who spoils her nephew, rather than a parent...

Keep telling your son why his dad was away. Have your husband tell him about his trip, so he understands why he's not been there. Maybe get some toy ships so they can play and bond over it.

Your husband needs to understand that this isn't personal, and you need to understand that it's hard for him to *not* find it personal. But your son will warm up to him quickly, I promise. In a week it will be crazy to think they were like strangers."
"&gt; I only had unprotected sex with 3-4 girls


Only 3 or 4 girls?


Only?



So 3 or 4 times you risked STDs and pregnancy with totally random girls.

"I understand that. I just went through it. My ex left me for another woman at the end of June. We had just used my check to pay the household bills and were going to use his for rent. He left a few days before rent was due and of course didn't help when he got paid. I sold everything I could to pay July's rent and gave my notice to move. I moved, filed for divorce and cut off all contact with him. People like these two are toxic. It's going to be rough for awhile but you will be so much better off.

Bodies change, libidos change...you're going to need more than that, more than smoking weed (i say this as a weed smoker).

In her eyes, I feel like she thinks she does. She feeds them and takes out the litter once per week. My standards of cleanliness are much higher- I think vacuuming several times a week and sweeping daily around the litter box are necessary. It's a good idea to push those issues or try to use this as an opportunity to bring up cleaning issues. I must admit that I feel a little bitter because since she has three cats, there is now really no opportunity for me to get one of my own. Which is something I thought about before she got the third one. "

"So you went out, never came home, didn't return texts or calls, and you're surprised he's upset that you got drunk and called a couple of guys(yes I know old friends), and crashed with them.  You say you were off the hook.  I'm not sure married life is exactly right for you right now.  I don't think anyone should expect to have the same freedom as you did when you were single.  It's not just about infidelity,  he probably had concerns about your safety and your whereabouts.  I think most people would have got up the next morning with dread that they had done permanent and serious damage to their marriage.  I don't think many would be o.k. with what you describe.  The ones that are o.k. with it have there own things they want to sneak around and do."

Make me feel loved by doing more xyz type things. If you need a break like going to the gym alone or to vent just ask.""

I'd say something similar. My husband loses a little bit of patience after a long day so I recommend he take a walk or go to a different area so he'll stop being so grumpy. It usually works itself out in five minutes because I call him our on bad behavior when it happens.

 A good man doesn't want to be a jerk/bad partner/bad parent so you should be able to communicate to him when he's out of shape."
"There's two big things jumping out at me here...

First, is that while your wife isn't being terribly polite, or rational, and is in fact being rude and childish...  it can also be said that she's probably not wrong.  A 25 year old, ""beautiful"" girl you met at a bar, is not going to end up with a guy your age, with two kids, unless something is wrong.  She's either got daddy issues, or sees you as a meal ticket, or she's just crazy.

Which brings me to point two...

Six months is too soon to have introduced her to your kids and ex wife.  **Especially** since she's so young.  But really, with where you are in life, you should never introduce someone to your kids or ex wife, until they've been in your life long enough that the two of you have made firm, concrete plans to be a part of each other's lives for the rest of your life.  As long as she's just a GF and you haven't made concrete, definitive plans for a permanent future together, she shouldn't meet your kids or your ex wife.

So, while you haven't done anything ""wrong"" by dating her, you did jump the gun on introducing her to everyone.

Best advice for you... chill out.  Let the thing with your ex wife blow over, and tell her that you plan to keep some distance between your GF and the kids.  That will calm your ex a bit.  In the mean time, maybe take a more skeptical eye toward the new GF."
"Write down the bad shit (or type it, whatever). Seriously, this helps. Our memories (especially in relationships where we've got these strong feelings) tend to gloss over the bad and remember the good. So make a document, write down the specific incidents, write down the patterns of abuse/asking for forgiveness/repeated abuse. Read that when you're tempted to give him another chance. Set rules for yourself about what behavior you expect from a partner."
"Trust your wife and stop making her job issues about you.

Jesus. "
"Seriously. All the points you bring up are good. 

The husband might as well just come out and say ""Hey as the woman/mother of the family I want you to sacrifice your happiness, career, and stability again for the good of the family.""

If she was a SAHM she's already gone above and beyond. That can destroy a career and now that she's happy he wants her to risk it all again? That's how you raise entitled misogynistic kids. 

She sounds like she was a great mom and their kids had a great dad too. I'm sure the daughter will be fine without free college and in the mean time the husband needs to develop some damn respect for his wife, her career, and her happiness. She didn't lose her entire identity when she got pregnant and she doesn't have to give up her autonomy. Her family shouldn't expect her to give that up.

Peeing all over the house can be a few things? Are they neutered? If not, have them neutered. If they are and theyre still marking, make sure it is marking and not a health problems. Cats who pee all over the place often have kidney or bladder problems (UTI, crystals, stones, ect). If it is purely behavioral (rare), your husband needs to work on training them to knock it off.

On behavioral, you both should have them confined to one room until your husband gets home. Make the sure room is cat proof and has enough space to hold two cats (like, dont lock them in a closet or a bathroom, lock them in a full sized room). Have electronic toys in there for them to play with, a litter box or two, water, and whatever food they didnt eat before your husband left. Ignore them while theyre in there. When your husband gets home, his job is to actively play with them to drain their pent up energy for atleast an hour. Of course, to feed them, groom them, and clean any messes they made as well. (edit) Benefit if he plays with the cats an hour before work as well, so they are less likely to disturb while locked in the room while hes at work. (/edit)

If your husband refuses to be responsible for the cats by doing all of the above (and possibly more), he should not own them and they must be rehomed as they deserve better. If he absolutely refuses to care for them and absolutely refuses to rehome them, you should reconsider living with him. Do you have a friend or family member you can stay with for a few days with your baby?"
"This hurt to read. Happy Birthday OP! I don't think you're overreacting. Your family forgetting seems really ridiculous, maybe less so for the girlfriend. Maybe in her head she's confident it's another day of the month? It takes me a little bit of time to commit to memory the exact day of the month a new partner's birthday is. You never know until you have the conversation, but definitely don't go into the convo acting like it didn't hurt you. "
"Of course you are. This is not a healthy relationship. Great boyfriends don't question why you're late when the answer is traffic, they don't keep tabs on you down to the second, they don't make up scenarios where they would have to crush your skull because you cheated on them. 

He's unstable at best. "
"Does your family buy gasoline?  Chances are some of it comes from Saudi Arabia, which actively executes gay people.

Does your family buy any products made in China?  They have at least as many LGBT restrictions as the owner of the store you work for wants to enact."
"And in her edit, it's come out that they're bringing a single woman along too to keep the boyfriend company, and that's why OP isn't invited? Oh *hell* naw."
"He cheated. He doesn't respect your feelings and hit on everyone at the party. He exposes himself not only embarrassing himself but you. His friends accept this behavior but that doesn't mean you have to. They laugh at him and joke(make him a joke) thus enabling this behavior. He doesn't want to plan for the future with you and you have been dating 3 years. GIRL! Leave! 

Please leave him and realize there are more respectful, honest people in the world that you can associate with. "
"I yeah ... Things like that are rarely direct, out in the open pressure. So her parents are indeed paying  50% of it all? I doubt that they directly said  ""No Best Man, no wedding,"" but they sure might have hinted and done a bit of arm-twisting and pouting."
"I'm a 31 year old woman and this is reminding me so much of my abusive high school boyfriend that I feel sick.  Like you, I suspected something was seriously wrong but brushed it off as ""This is high school, how serious can it be?""

Many, many incidents are off here, but really sticks out to me is that you're worried about getting in trouble with him.  You should never fear your friends or partners.

His loneliness is not your problem.  He can go out and make friends/seek mentors, he chooses not to.

Please, please cut of all contact with this person.  If your parents are half way decent, let them know what's going on.  Same with your friends.  You owe this person nothing after how he's treated you.  If you simply blocked him on everything that would be more than enough."
"This is the ""secrets are lies"" and ""sharing is caring"" line of reasoning that Dave Eggers poked fun at in the book *The Circle* (don't watch the film adaptation, it's horrible).

Your girlfriend's self-esteem, self-worth, and entire identity is wrapped up in what other people think, feel, and believe – particularly when it comes to the artificial, curated image she cultivates for public consumption. 

And she's right.  You *are* ""hiding"" something.  It's called privacy, quietude, and a sense of knowing who you are as a person independently of what people think about you or what you think they want to see. 

The bottom line:  your girlfriend is a narcissist and you aren't.  You know what to do."
I have been a hospice volunteer for many years and have devoted a lot of time volunteering in memory care as part of that. This is the exact advice that I would give to any family struggling with a decision like this. 
"3) if it bothers them so much, they can buy the husband a new car so he can drive himself to work.

"&gt;He was not dating much before we met.

Not if he acts like this, no"
"While the location wasn't stated, an one bedroom apartment will cost between 1k to 2k (lets says 1.5k) and the cost could be split if there are flatmates.  Utilities will be be another 500.  Your bf makes 3k, so at the beginning of each month 2k is automatically deducted for basic living expenses.  This leaves 1k remaining for everything else.  Now you make 1k without having to pay for rent or utilities.  This essentially puts you and your bf on equal spending levels.  

I think it does sound entitled when he's struggling as it is.  Also, love isn't defined by material gifts, but rather how much quality time he wants to spend with you and if he makes you happy.  If his spending habits really bother you, set aside some time to sit down and talk to him about it and then decide if this relationship is right for you.

Edit: spelling and grammar."
"I agree, thank you! If it comes down to having to break up, I will. But I really don't want to take that step, so how do you suggest that I reassure him? I've tried, but I don't think that mere words are enough to satisfy his anxiety about the situation."
She's not even invited yet? What a presumptious move then! Don't invite her.
I'm so very sorry for your loss OP. 
"So you guys dated for a month and he only told you he was seeing this other woman AFTER dating for a month, what you thought was exclusively?

not so impressed.

&gt;Today he messaged me saying he thinks he's made a mistake, and feels like a dick for hurting me, but also said he doesn't think anything will last with her because she has a child and he can't stop thinking about me.

So is he still seeing this woman or not? It sounds like he is, and if so, what the **fuck** is he doing texting you? You made your feelings clear. "
if your gf isnt suspicious after the pictures I feel sorry for her. and I feel sorry that you still want to marry her after you betrayed her like this. 
"It's the malicious brother to ""learned helplessness."""
"You should grow up.

&gt; I was just saying that it made me uncomfortable because I thought we were having a discussion. 

Yeah, you were having a discussion. You were having a discussion about what a shitty experience she had, and you made it all about you. Your role in that type of discussion is to show sympathy and support. Instead, you demanded sympathy and support. Yeah, growing up would be a good step."
"This is the feeling I got from the entire situation. People seems to want to attribute a level of malice to the guy that I don't feel is warranted at all. I think the most reasonable explanation is that he just wanted to be with his fiance, not that he someone had some scheme to trap her..."
"Calm down with the hysterics alright.

Also I didn't say 'force'. In the same way a parent will look under a child's bed to show them there's no monsters and then get the child to look and be like ""see it's okay!"". It's slowly encouraging them to not be afraid"
"That's straightforward and not unreasonable. I've had one tattoo longer than you've been alive but I can't stand gauges. If I were dating a guy who wanted to get one, it'd be a serious turn-off."
"I might be in the minority here but I don't get what you did wrong. I mean your exes brother (?) yes should be off limits but if you both were single, not related, you didn't do anything wrong if you view it as a man and a woman showering together. Were you to never have a past before him? Did he think your daughter was immaculate conception?? 

He went WAY overboard. I can see being uncomfortable that you got naked with an exes sibling but to call you a whore and go on to the extent he did??? I'd be telling him he is right I also regret marrying you so let's call it off. 

His reaction is way overboard and you didn't betray him. If I'm reading this right you hadn't met your husband yet? You were single correct???

"What the absolute fuck.

&gt; Tom wakes up and then it's back to normal conversation and no flirtation from Lou

Is she still wandering around with her nips out when he boyfriend gets up?

This is honestly bizarre. I would have been done the first time I saw this tbh. Especially after hearing your boyfriend's reaction.

&gt; ""yeah, she's just comfortable with her body and I admire that""

Please, his *boner* admires her.

Loud sex is awkward, but okay what can you do. Walking around in shorts or whatever, fine, it's as much her place as yours. *Walking around with her tits out and flirting with your boyfriend infront of you while acting cold to you?* Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah."
"&gt; Given the backstory I don't think that's a malicious thing

I mean . . . there's malice and then there's the self-obsession strong enough to bend facts to please oneself. And I don't think the latter is necessarily *better* than malice. He may have been young himself, but I don't think that's an excuse to neglect an animal he committed to caring for (and yes, no veterinary care and poor training is neglect). His story has let him refuse to take any responsibility for his pet, and it sounds like he still fails pets in the same way."
"Ask her and your dad why if this is such an issue why she refuses to call you. You've tried calling and gotten nowhere. Firmly tell them it's now up to your mother to reach out because you have tried and have been rebuffed. Just pivot back to that. Why can't she call you to fix it? Until they can answer that, or they realize she won't call, don't accept anything else.

You've got to pick a line to draw at this somewhere. Asking her to call is simple enough that if they can't get that she won't, you won't ever be able to get them to figure it out and you'll know where you stand.

You can even pull the call log and track when the last time she called and how many times you have since to get across how much you have tried and how she hasn't."
" My mother and I used to have the exact same phone with the same phone case and I used to grab hers all the time by mistake and that's the story of how I accidentally read messages between her and my father that I wish I didn't.

"Usually the ""crazy ex girlfriend"" is code for ""it didn't work out because I treated her like shit so I'm gonna spin the story."" I do believe her. I have been in a similar situation and although I never messaged the later women, part of me sort of wishes I did? Regardless, her 4th paragraph especially...I don't think this is some intense revenge plot. It's been a while, and she sounds like she's genuinely trying to give you a warning for your safety. Definitely do not show it to him...you could put her and yourself in danger; just be wary of his behaviour (if you continue to stay). Plus, considering the fact that he's tried to convince you she's a ""psycho"", he would obviously just deny that it's true (and probably get really angry...? based on your answer to another user). Actively think about the ways he treats you and speaks to you, as well as the way he talks about other people (particularly other women, like his ex). That stuff can be really telling. "
"Anxiety has been mentioned three times - she is going to an online highschool because of it, and college, and can't have an Instagram. She needs to get into therapy/on medication ASAP when it's affecting her life that much. She can't avoid people forever."

"Right ? When the most positive description of your marriage at 36 is ""fine"" and ""not bad"" it's time to re-evaluate things."
"I'm the child of an alcoholic who has been sober for about ten years, FWIW. 

Okay, so just because he's in a treatment program for his alcoholism doesn't mean he is recovering. He is still drinking, which means he isn't recovering. He is still a full blown alcoholic until he gets sober. 

Plus, there's no such thing as a recovering or a recovered alcoholic. There are only alcoholics and everyone else. You never stop being an addict just because you're sober.

Ignoring you when you say ""no"" and ""stop"" is not a problem that stems from his alcoholism. That is about him. If he doesn't respect you enough to respect your wishes, when either drunk or sober, getting sober isn't going to just fix that.

In your other comments here, you seem to hold out hope that he will get sober. I want to say very clearly and loudly to you so you get this. He has only taken a token level of effort to get sober. He doesn't seem like he's going to AA, going to therapy or even actively trying to stop drinking on his own. 

You need a reality check. He isn't really trying to get sober at all. If he was, he wouldn't be drinking like this. An alcoholic who is trying to get sober is usually so ashamed by their drinking that they will try to do it in secret (they'll lie about going to the store but go to the bar, they'll drink non alcoholic beer but spike it with vodka, they'll hide nips of alcohol in the house and go to them). The fact that he is in your face drinking alcohol in your bed tells me he is not even trying to get sober.

He is a full blown addict. That is more than most people would ever want to deal with in a relationship. He is fighting for his life and he doesn't seem to know it and doesn't seem to realize that he's even putting himself and you in danger. I mean, if he was addicted to crack or meth, would you stay with him then? Alcoholism isn't any different. 

Honestly, addicts talk about needing to hit rock bottom before they can get sober. You sticking with him through this is admirable, but leaving him might be the kick in the butt he needs to get sober. You can always leave the door open to get back together if he is able to get sober for a length of time. 

And what do you plan for your own life? Do you want to get married and have kids? Well, alcoholism is a lifelong thing. You will be dealing with this crap for the rest of your life as long as you're with him. If you have kids, they will have to grow up with a drunk for a dad and that's really not okay to do to them, which I say as a child of an alcoholic. "
Why are you making the bed? You don't even sleep in it. Why would you want to be with this man? He Sounds foul. 
"I like this best. With someone this unreasonable it's best to shut them down quickly and firmly. If you start making excuses she'll just keep pushing. 

On a side note, I'm curious as to who her photographer was before. If she had anyone remotely professional she would know that $100 is a laughable amount. And it also seems suspicious to me that someone would cancel at short notice and not offer compensation or an alternative contact. I have my doubts she ever even *had* a photographer booked. "
"He proposed because he probably thinks that grand gesture is enough so that you don't leave him for this **INCREDIBLY STUPID SHITTY UNFORGIVABLE THING HE DID**. And he didn't tell you for months holy fuck. He didn't propose out of love or respect or wanting to build a life with you. Don't be delusional.

Dump him, mourn the relationship, get tested, move on. You can do so much better than this. High school relationships rarely last. I don't see how you could ever trust someone who cheated on you and exposed you to a terrible STD.

Also, he's a freaking child and you're the only one acting like an adult in this relationship. You had to basically get him a job. He can't control himself to not sleep with a HIV+ coworker. Please, dump this loser."

"I have two 2 year olds. This is the only way to get them over stuff. They started being scared of stuff for no reason at all. 

One decided he was scared to death of fans while we were in a flea market full of, you guessed it, fans. After screaming fits every time we passed one I had enough, crouched down and explained it was just blowing air to keep him cool and blew in his face making a fan sound then placed him near one gently immersing him in the air. He's fine. 

Second one decided he was scared of one of our tiki masks hanging near his trampoline. I took it down explaining it was just daddy's mask. He giggled and will reach out and touch it (stuck it on a table out of the way but he can stand on his tip toes and lightly touch it). He'a fine now. 

I must be a horrible mom. Getting them over fears. Better call CPS now /s

Now is the time to get kids over fears, gently, slowly and explaining it. Two year olds aren't dumb. Now, throwing them into it with no explanation and laughing at them is wrong. There is a correct way to do it.  "

"And this is an example of behavior OP can cite when telling David that he is not welcome in the group. It's not his beliefs (I mean, it kind of is) but rather his approach to discussion and debate, and his reaction to opinions that differ from his own. If David showed that he was able to be calm during discussions that veered from his point of view, it would be different. Bit any person, on either side of the political spectrum, who gets so mad he has to storm out on paying for dinner is NOT going to add any value to the group.  "
"I would understand this line of thinking if they were all in their early 20's or younger, but they're all his age or older. There's no reason people above the age of 20/21 should act like this towards someone they don't know that well. 

They have enough real world experience to know better. "
This guy can duck himself. It's not unfair for him to want this open situation but it is unfair to lie about it. Also it's ok for you to be uncomfortable to be second to someone. Open relationships only work for some
"This might be a controversial question, but I haven't seen anyone ask it yet: Do you actually want to do the day to day job of being a SEAL? Your descriptions are all about the perks to the role and how sexy its reputation is, but do you actually want to do the presumably risky stuff that they would do day in and day out? Before you make any decisions, I would make sure you've considered carefully whether you want the difficult responsibilities of the job and aren't just swept up in the appeal of the title. Things that get you that much prestige come at a cost. Also, something that might have been right for your lifestyle at 18 might not be right for you at 28. If those things aren't true and SEALs is perfect for you, then you definitely have a lot to think about."

"This. Abortion regret is also nowhere near as bad as the guilt that goes with raising a child with disabilities caused by drinking in pregnancy. I have seen a couple of interviews with women, very brave women, who speak publicly about causing their children's fetal alcohol problems to warn others, and it's harrowing. Their lives are completely defined by living with what they've done while literally living with the consequences. Self-inflicted, sure, but also terribly tragic for all concerned, including the mothers. OP, you do not want this for your wife. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."

You do realize that your attitude might be one of the reasons that she is choosing to stay away from you?
Like the last time I saw this many red flags was the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.
An ultimatum this soon in the relationship is a sign of a controlling and potentially abusive partner. Add in the age gap and you've got a situation that can only end in tears. Don't give up your life for this guy. Don't bend to this sort of manipulation.
"You should practice saying the following, so when you're caught off guard by her weird requests or observations, you still know how to respond. And the thing about these responses are, the only people who find them impolite are the rude, creepy, intrusive people who are crossing normally observed boundaries anyway, so you should not care about being ""impolite"". Say it kindly. Say it while smiling. Doesn't matter as long as you say it with conviction.

Her: ""You haven't showered in 3 days, do you have the plague?""
You: ""That makes me uncomfortable. Have a nice day, CreepyPants."" Close the door/walk away.

Her: ""Every time I hear a loud noise, you need to call me to tell me you're okay.""
You: ""I won't be doing that. Goodnight, CreepyPants."" Close the door/walk away.

Unless you went overboard and told her you're his #1 fan, don't want to listen to anything else, etc....... I honestly don't get how this even happened.

You don't even have to go back on your lie and confess (would be too weird at this point), just tell her you have other music artists you enjoy (that you actually enjoy) and listen to them as a normal human does.  Maybe a JM song or 2 is in the rotation but generally people are not just obsessed with one artist.

Or you can just say you're getting over it and start listening to other shit.  People's tastes evolve overtime.  I don't listen exclusively to the same artist for years on end. I am having a hard time grasping why this is such a big issue. "

"Listen, I went on a **Tinder** date for Christ's sake, looking to find a bootycall type thing, even had awkward misunderstandings when we first met up... but before an hour had passed we had developed a connection. After dinner, we talked for hours and hours over wine.   
  
We told each other about our lives. His parents are dead, his mother died from Huntington's. In case you aren't aware, Huntington's is 100% fatal, and is passed genetically, with the child (my date) having 50% of having this fatal disease as well. He told me this the first night we met. I told him about deeply personal things as well.  
  
I understand why you did what you did, but in effect you did lie to your gf. She deserved full knowledge of what she was getting into by investing time into you. She thought she was dating a healthy young man. Now she finds out he has bone cancer and found out he hid it for a year like it's a fucking million dollar inheritance or some shit. If the cancer isn't a big deal then why hide it? I also knew a young man in college with managed leukemia and all his friends knew. Didn't make him special it was a small part of his identity, a reminder of mortality. This ""stigma"" may not seem real or justified in your GF's eyes to warrant such secrecy. I personally agree with her. But sometimes people don't agree. That why you date, and break up over personal deal-breakers. It's too bad you guys had different values. But I don't think there's much you can do besides apologize and offer to explain.   
  
The man I'm dating now, I fully understand his life may be cut short. He's not ready to get genetic testing yet. I am choosing to be with him regardless. I understand you are healthy now, but can you truly say your cancer will affect nothing in the future? Your children? Your fertility? Life expectancy? "
"This is a good idea, thanks! I just feel like it's a little complicated because when she found out about the cat, she immediately said she didn't want it and even a month in she feels a little cornered into it by the rest of her family. And she promised me she didn't want to keep it and wouldn't. I guess I just feel like I'm being a little walked over. But I know she's probably going through a lot right now even if it doesn't show! And I want to be sensitive to that, which is exactly why I wrote the post in the first place. So thanks for the perspective. "

"Yeah, he just doesn't give a shit. I've been monstrously underemployed for most of my adult life, thanks to graduating into the recession. My husband, on the other hand, not so much. We have an income disparity really close to the one in this post, if not wider. I have never once, in ten years, thought it was my right to spend his money. I have never assumed that he will pay for anything of mine, and I ask if he can cover my half of dinner/movie tickets/whatever else if I can't (Plus we tend to split up groceries, or one of us will buy lunch and then the other picks up dinner stuff). This isn't How Broke People Work, this is a dude who feels entitled to his partner's income, and will do pretty much any damn thing to get it."

What, it did to me/I did to myself, internally was too much and needed healing for a few years after the fact. My issues. Not hers. To this day, I want nothing but her dreams to come true.      
That being said, I wish I would have left.     
If your boyfriend is having issues now, decide immediately, for both your sakes, which is more important. If this is a dream, you really have to move on and maybe date within the acting world, or luckily find a guy in his early twenties that has no jealousy issues.    
What I will say, and this is no excuse, Is that I was not strong enough to admit I wasn't okay with what was happening. If he is saying something, he needs to wake up now to the fact he is dating an actress. If he can't wake up to that, then no hard feelings but it is time to split.     
Anyway, this is just my two cents from the opposite perspective."

"My husbands 87 years old granmda still does her own lawn work. It gives her neighbors a heart atack, because she'll climb up a ladder and trim her trees with her mini chainsaw. But her husband kept their yard neat for 60 years and it helps her feel close to him after his passing."
"if you want to remain friends with her, let her know immediately that you've broken up with him and that you're going no contact and that you expect that she won't allow him to get access to her accounts.

i'm sure if he somehow manages to, you'll realize it's him. i would just write something like 'i refuse to engage with you. leave me alone' if he continues it you might have to block her as well."
"I'm wondering...if Frank was an ogre about the dog to Lucy all those years ago...if Lucy finds out Frank is OP's husband, will Lucy want to even be friends with OP? Haha...something to think about.

"See, this is why I avoid romantic relationships... I would be petty as hell.  I'd be out at the gym, out with friends, going out to clubs and dance.  I wouldn't tell him anything, not even say bye when I left, just to see how long it takes for him to miss me and freak out. "
"He beat the shit out of you growing up and he just assaulted your sister.

Your sense of 'severe' is severely fucked up. You need therapy, immediately. Your messed up sense of normal is going to put your child's life at risk."
"She sounds pretty manipulative; whispering and choosing to not involve you in this cottage business but happily letting you cook/clean/manage her life for you. Also ringing you multiple times when she knows you're busy, and tonne rude enough to say you don't do anything to help her.

Does she know you're planning to try for a baby? Did the cottage talk start around the same time? You need to put your foot down with your husband. Your husband needs to put his foot down with his mum. You guys have already been doing loads for her, you won't have the time when you're pregnant and you'll only start to resent her more anyway. She needs to start living her life and not relying on you guys so much. It sounds like it's already becoming too much. You and your husband are family now, you need family time too."
Yep..and he managed to jump straight to making it about his own ego rather than what she's been through

"What kind of shit bag tries to cut the person they're supposed to love and support down? What kind of shit bag compares their lover to other women? What kind of shit bag wants to make their girlfriend feel awful?

Honey here's the ONLY reason he did this: he's cripplingly insecure. He cut down your ex's, people who were a part of your life, and then cut you down to make you feel lesser.

He's afraid of your past and scared you're gonna leave him for someone better.

You should."
"My wife and I are like this, it is hard for either of us to sleep without the other one there.

Best thing I know is a lot of exercise so you are *really* physically tired."
"Why are his dad and uncle speculating on your marriage breaking up? 

This is messy in a way that I think is a red flag, because I can't imagine when I get married even wanting my family or in laws to have an idea, even less a frequently voiced opinion, about our marital finances. To me it sounds like the problem is just that his family is a bunch of fucking nosy busybodies. Honestly, these sound like smokescreens for the fact that you're so much older than him (reproductively speaking) and they are wondering what's the hold up on having a kid because to them you are running out of time. 

Tell them to stop counting y'alls goddamn money and pull way back from them being in your marital business. "
"&gt; Anyways about half of them were sat in my section and I just didn't want to deal with girl drama so I asked my boyfriend to switch with me.

Er....if you thought they'd be trouble, why did you think that trouble would disappear if you left them to your boyfriend? And it's pretty crappy of you to not want to serve a group of people because of their gender. 

&gt; at one point he was brushing and braiding one of their hair (like literally...WTF!!!?)

Yeah that and the contact info is crossing the line. Dump him. 

EDIT: Here's a thought. I used to serve, and I'd be annoyed if someone (not to mention my significant other, who's supposed to care about me) dropped a large party of people on me that they believed would be troublesome. His behavior was definitely over the line here, but do you think he partially wanted to spite you? You put him in a situation that you yourself didn't want to be a part of, and he probably felt jilted. Maybe his flirting was a way of getting back at you for doing this to him? Still unacceptable with the hairbraiding and stuff. "
"Listen to this advice, OP. Buddy here couldn't even make it through the list of questions. Some of them are reasonable, normal questions that a lot of people ask in new relationships (ex. how to approach conflict, sleepovers with the opposite gender, etc.) but others are just so specific that they're issues within themselves and can't even be considered ""questions"" (ex. ""Do we ever owe each other help with school work? Should we ever have to write an entire paper for our partner if they forgot and it is due in 2 hours?"", ""Should we ever be able to peer pressure our partner into doing certain drugs? What is a respectful way to offer our partner recreational drugs?"", ""Should money ever be used to threaten or control our partner?"").

None of these specific, targeted ""questions"" would need to be asked in a healthy relationship where both people can trust one another and expect each other to be decent human beings. And none of these specific, targeted ""questions"" would be asked or even *considered* in the mind of someone who knows what's normal in a healthy relationship (in this case, OP). OP needs to break up with this guy, and work on her own perceptions of a healthy relationship before trying to be in one. 


"
"I'm really surprised nobody has brought this up, but your sister was totally out of line. Even if she was grossed out by the thought of you visiting prostitutes, your sex life is NONE of her business, and calling all of your friends to catch you in the lie is just ridiculous. 

I'm not going to say that going to prostitutes frequently is necessarily the healthiest behavior, but it's far from the worst, especially living in the country that you do. Point is, it's your choice and not hers. It really has no bearing on her life at all. 

Honestly, that level of privacy invasion would be extremely off-putting to me. I'd be looking for a new place to live if I were you; your sister sounds like the kind of person who won't stop with just this one instance."
"""I realize that I'm unlikely to meet a woman who's my intellectual equal""

With that attitude, you certainly won't. A smart woman isn't going to put up with a man who looks down on her. "
"&gt; I don't know how to feel. 

Relief?  There's a reason he targeted you at 22 when he was 34. He knew what he was doing. Women his age have learned how to recognize and avoid his screaming red flags."
"I'm more confused why he's flipping out at all. He must know she's had sexual partners in the past - I mean she even has a daughter! So why is he so upset about this one guy when he's assumedly fine with the other men she's full on slept with, rather than just showered with?"
"I had similar issues, moved from Chicago to a small town of about 4K and I get what you're saying about small town gossip and such, but who gives a shit? Your mail carrier is not doing her job, if people are going to gossip and talk badly about you because you don't like your mail being all fucked up, you probably don't want to associate with those assholes anyways, so who cares."
"If she's with the family nurse partnership, she will have been in your life from when you were pregnant. It's a special scheme for young mums. They are HVs but with some extra training. 

Anxiety can be really hard. Having a baby can make it much much worse. What helps with your anxiety?"
"Jesus. I always felt like I was insecure but I would never fault my SO for saying something as innocent as that. What, is he supposed to pretend there are *no other* attractive women in the world once he gets with me?

There's a big difference between rubbing it in her face that he thinks other women are hot, and saying something privately to a friend that she never would have seen or known about in the first place, had she not violated his privacy."
"The short answer is absolutely. Yes he is controlling. 

Maybe he should go to therapy because his daughter is involved and it would be better for her to have some healthy boundaries. Although be prepared OP, asking him to go to therapy will be a fight.

If you choose to set some kind of ultimatum you need to follow through otherwise he will never believe you ever again."
"Where was she going to sleep? You said your bed... do you and boyfriend sleep separately? Cause 'my guest is sleeping in the guest room' doesn't make much sense as a complaint.

Okay, so she's kind of a shitty houseguest in that she's not cleaning up after herself, or contributing. You need to ask her to do those things, or buy her own food and clean up after herself.

And... do you have issues with communication or confrontation? I feel like you didn't want her to come in the first place but said yes anyway."
"My opinion, as a stranger on the internet who has only read the information you have given us, is that there's a chance your wife told your daughter as an attempt to erode the relationship between you two. That way, you have no ties to your previous marriage, and your wife can have you all to herself. 

For the next while, focus on your daughter and your relationship with her. If your wife is sincerely remorseful for her slip-up, then she will support you strengthening your relationship with your daughter. If she starts hinting at putting distance between you and your daughter, or appears resentful of the attention you're giving her, then you'll know her true intentions."
"Thank you. The reason I didn't tell her was that I didn't think she needed the complication in her life, with the divorce happening and her mother soon marrying another man. She was already angry at her, I didn't want to add to her anger. It just seemed unnecessary burden on her at that time.

Therapy now looks good. I'll talk to her about it. "
"Situations like like this are why I refuse to comment on political/religious statuses on facebook, and unfollow family members who seem very invested in posting such things. My sister and my uncle had a falling out over a stupid facebook thing, it seems like a hazardous environment to have these kinds of conversations.

The damage has been done. You need to limit your contact with them for you and your fiancee. Your younger brothers are adults and will be able to separate themselves from your parents (if they haven't already) so you will be able to maintain contact with them. Give it a cooling off period of a few months, don't comment or post inflammatory stuff on facebook, see if they would be open to talking again. If not, you're going to need to keep things at a distance and live your own life."
I will add one word to your two. **Term** life insurance. A healthy 30 male should be able to get term insurance that will take care of his family if he dies. He could get 1 million on him for like $35 a month. 
"Bingo! Instead, it's ""I'm not going to get between him and his kids."" Something is way, wayyy off here. "
"You don't need a solid reason to break up with him. He's making you feel like shit, whether he understands that or not. He can't argue is way out of this. You feel frustrated and unhappy, and he refuses to make changes so you don't feel that way anymore. I would break up with him if I were you."
"Not your circus, not your monkeys.

It's not your job to protect Kevin from the consequences of his own stupidity.  Do your job, don't contact him, and move on."
"He's very midwestern (his term) about talking about money, i.e. he doesn't think it's polite. I think that  part of the issue is he works in a field where there's a big difference in salaries depending on your abilities/education. He works in marketing, where for example, you could probably make $20k-30k a year freelancing or working for a non profit or $100k working for some huge firm. I think maybe the family doesn't get which end he's on. "
"&gt;I feel like constantly denying it isn't going to do anything except make it more scandalous.

Yeah, don't stoop to her level. Participating in her drama in any way will just let you look bad. Just stay really levelheaded and if anyone asks you about it just reply with a blank, ""I have no idea what you're talking about.""

I doubt you're going to get in trouble over rumors... you're all people, this kind of stuff happens sometimes. As long as you cut all contact with your ex and don't engage, you can't be reprimanded for anything.

Just ignore and rise above. You can't control what she does so all you can control are your own actions."
"Don't invite her.

It's not your job to manage this woman's emotions.

If she asks you say it's just going to be immediate family. "
"I'm with your wife on this one. It would be extremely troubling to see my significant other be totally relaxed about an environment rife with infidelity.

"I'm a chick and I too have a thing against dating anyone who is overweight. It's shallow but I own it. 

However, I have a strong preference *against* tall guys. I'm short and would prefer someone close to my height -- and shorter than me is absolutely fine. Like, I've had a crush on Peter Dinklage since he was in *The Station Agent*. 

Human beings have preferences and that's okay as long as you aren't an asshole about it."
"What culture are you from, just curious?

No, this is absolutely not normal in the U.S. and he is seriously taking advantage of you. I'm so disgusted right now. 

Are you here on a visa or some other temporary program? You sound very new to the States. Maybe you can get some help on new living arrangements. "
"It's really obvious how eagerly you're grasping at any vague hint of ""it's okay to break up and leave her to handle this mess alone!""  

He means cool off so you're not too angry to talk calmly before talking to her about this, not completely take a break and ignore the issue/your part in it. "
"Your boyfriend isn't much of a boyfriend. Tell him the fact he didn't trust you, at the age of 30, and checks your phone three times a day is juvenile and petty and you're not about that life."

"Your brain's an echo chamber right now.  The little frustrations are reverberating off the walls and seem a lot more significant than they normally would.

"just me, but if I keep an item in the common areas then it's a common use item, unless otherwise explicitly agreed. I played my roommates CDs, on another roommate's stereo, drinking my wine sitting on someone else's couch, and we all watched my big TV. 

not the same as food. 

you can ask them not to use it and see what happens. hopefully you have good flatmates who won't take it personal. 

but if it's really just for you two, then keep it in your private space. yup, that means carting water refills and finding space, c'est la vie dès roomies"
"She might be bullied - a bigger concern is that she'll have to go through life confirming the spelling every. Single. Time. ""What's your name? Mike?"" That would drive me nuts. Unique names are all well and good, but as life goes on they just become a pain in the ass. Let her personality and life path be a reflection of her unique self, let her name be something that won't cause her irritation. "
"Then suddenly he's never home and she's upset that she's raising the kids all on her own and the pool boy starts looking pretty fucking good and they decide that she will divorce you, take half your shit and you'll be on the hook for child support and alimony because she never pursued her career to raise your children. 

Life balance will always matter more than money. "

"If it makes you feel better, I walk like a buff man looking to get into a fight with his drug dealer. 

Physically, I'm a woman.

Don't worry about what other people think. I don't think your SO meant anything bad by it. And don't take your ex's opinion seriously. It's your walk - it's not exactly something you intentionally affect like your haircut or how often you bathe."
"Considering he stormed off and ended up leaving you guys to foot the dinner bill, I don't think he'll be a good member to add to your group. If he can't keep his disagreements civil, there's no point. Besides, not every argument needs to have an ""opposite"" side. You wouldn't invite the KKK to a discussion about race relations, would you? That's a false illusion of the other side. "

"Thing is, she actually does go to grief counseling. I'm sure her therapist has picked up on some of her issues I described here, but no diagnosis. She has worked really hard to beat self harming and suicide thoughts, and I'm really proud of her. The issue we are having now is that she just doesn't see anything wrong. If she gets treatment for it I'm sure she'd work very hard."
"You know who puts down confident girlfriends? Insecure, awful guys. You need to break up with him. There is no coming back from this and you don't deserve it no matter how much he may cry and explain it away later.

"Have you ever told your wife any of that? Like, you're surrounded by people you don't like most hours of the day and don't think to mention that to your life partner? 

I get compartmentalization. I have zero desire to talk about the nuts and bolts of my work with anyone outside work and sometimes after a stressful day I just want to forget it and talk about other stuff, but I can't imagine not sharing my feelings about my coworkers with a spouse for two years. Like, at the very least if were your wife I would be hurt that I wasn't someone you'd confide in."

"Truth. A man with a good grasp on respecting and seeing both genders as people... they get snatched up so fast. 

He's mine. No one else gets him now.

The fact he is actually an addict just makes that message from the ex all the more believable. It's well worded and she has described him exactly as he is now (2 months into a relationship). Please be careful @OP. I have a bad feeling he is exactly what his ex has described him to be.

"There are a fair number of posts on this very sub from men/women working 100 hour weeks for huge salaries, posting here that they hate their job because it's ruining their life/family with the stress and no time... OP is smart to recognize that before he's trapped in the job."
"Jane doesn't owe you anything.  You tried to kiss her boyfriend, she gets to dislike you if she wants to.  And if you interrupted her time with Martin without giving him a heads up that you were coming over, she was likely uneasy with that - it suggests you and Martin might've been closer than guys with girlfriends usually are with new female friends, particularly with women who've tried to kiss them.

&gt;I don't think I should need her approval for Martin or the rest of the group to be friends with me.

Actually you probably do need her to like you for Martin to be friends with you, and you probably need Martin to be friends with you for the rest of the group to be friends with you.  That's how many couples operate.  You're not entitled to anyone's friendship, and if they don't care for you enough to be friends with you if Jane doesn't like you, that's their prerogative.

This seems like the natural consequence of building up a friendship group with a guy who has a girlfriend but who you tried to kiss.  Your best step seems to be to step back and wait and see if they still want to include you or if you get a chance to make a better impression on Jane.  But in the meantime I'd try to meet some new friends."

"I would honestly ask him, ""Do you have tourettes? Are these rude and inappropriate interruptions a result of some issue between your brain and your mouth? Do we need to take you to a mental health professional to see why you keep saying stupid shit after I've repeatedly told you not to?"" 

There was a post by a woman not long ago about her partner who suddenly started behaving REALLY inappropriately. Oggling women in public, practically rubbing himself in public, muttering ""big boobies"" to himself obsessively. Whenever she brought it up, he claimed to not be doing it. It was really disturbing, but it was clear there was some serious mental issue going on with her husband. I would start suggesting to your husband that you're concerned for his mental health. Even if you're not, the implication that he's behaving more like a mentally-disturbed pervert than a witty edgy man of 30 might shut him up. "
"Forgiveness is a real thing, and people can and do change. It's important to recognize that. "
"""He can do no wrong,"" is not healthy."
"It does, quite often. I have a friend who has had this happen a few times. One time it was a pair of flip flops, she interrogated her boyfriend, asking who's they were. A few hours later she figured out they were her sister's. One time she found a pair of random girls underwear down the side of his bed, and berated him for hours. She later realised they were hers that she'd lost months before. "
She made sure to take all the wedding shower gifts to her parents house before the wedding. Convenient. I made the announcement after it became clear that she wasn't coming that I wanted everyone to take their gifts with them and leave nothing. Thankfully people did as I asked.
"OP, don't even bother to give you boyfriend an ultimatum.  Just break up right now and go no-contact.  You will never win in the long run with him over his sister."
"You both got yourself into this mess. 

You sat on your doubts for months &amp; knew for weeks that you wanted to break up with your fiancé, but you decided to let him travel out to visit you &amp; blindsided him. Instead of letting him know what was going on with you, you kept him out of the loop. He probably wouldn't have made this crazy decision if he knew you'd been feeling distant for months, but if he did, you wouldn't feel so guilty about it. 

He made a big, life-altering decision that affects both of you without talking to you about it. (See the parallel here? You didn't talk to him about wanting to break up, &amp; he didn't talk to you about being unable to manage the distance anymore.) While this would be applauded in a romcom, you're in the real world &amp; worried about logistics like his income in a new city without a new job lined up. If he had communicated with you about the long distance, you could have discussed solutions together &amp; made an informed decision. 

So basically, there's no easy way to deal with the fallout now that you've both sat on your feelings without discussing them. You just have to work through it. Just don't pity date him if you're not feeling it - you already stayed pity engaged, so don't do that to him again. He's going to have a hard enough time recovering from his snap judgment. "
"&gt; ""I consider a 29-year-old man who dates an 18-year-old girl and has to borrow money from her and calls her crazy a good partner. Also, even though he does those things, I can't leave because we have a kid together.""

Leave, even though you have a kid together. Your partner is not a good person."

I also got out of sales because sales turns me into the devil. Sell ice to an eskimo and all that. "
"This is a good suggestion. OP, I'm a former egg donor and can answer any questions you have if you want to pm me."
"Honestly, who *cares?* He's a city bus driver, not her sexually abusive boss. He's being a dick because she's letting him. If I were her, I'd whip out the NYC 'tude right about now and let him know what's up: ""Just so you know, I've taken down your name, your route, and your bus (or badge) number and I'll be reporting you to the transit authority. What you're doing is illegal, rude, and aggressive, and I'll be taking your route and reporting you each day that you do this. I will be encouraging other passengers affected by your behavior to do the same. Still want to play games?"""
"Yes, this is exactly what should happen. Not only would it make OP's life easier, but it would be fantastic for the women's mental health to live together. Loneliness and isolation are deadly for the elderly."
"He actually said he's ""not good at stuff like that"" right after he sent his best friend a heartfelt text message telling her he's there for her? And after he told you he feels sorry for her and wants to do whatever he can to cheer her up? When all he gave you was ""oh that sucks""? This... guy is full of shit, okay. He doesn't care about you, he feels no empathy or sympathy for you at all. While one of your best friends were dying and you were a wreck he kept going on about having to work a shift he didn't like. If I didn't know better, I'd want to say what he MEANT to say was, ""I'm not good at stuff like that when it comes to people I don't care about or can't relate to"". Because that's honestly what it sounds like his deal is. Break up with him, he's not worth it. Find someone who'll be there for you and support you. "
"Instead of being happy he is doing well, she is jealous. She is seeing the relationship as ""me and him"" and not as ""us"". I wouldn't be able to be with such a person. "
"Some people use ""hey how are you?"" the same way other's just say ""hello"", I doubt he really wants to know how you're doing twice within 15 mins. 

This guy sounds obnoxious but I would say to just ignore it. Don't talk to him about personal stuff, don't really respond when he talks to you about personal stuff, and eventually he'll get the hint I think. If he asks you what's up just say nothing, and continue to keep your relationship as professional as possible. "
Man I hate Marge too. She always gets up so close in your face when she's talking to you. You can see her wooly hair from a mile away and I always take the long way home to avoid her when I do.
"&gt; Really confused about why you're only considering reporting him at this point. He's rude, he's not doing his job, and his behavior isn't affecting only you, but also the other people on the bus (who may not be aware of what's going on). Freaking report him!

Not to mention if you have to put it in writing, you have it all right here! Mention the angry lecture regardless of if you complain verbally or in writing, because I honestly think that's important too. (""he was very angry and it made me as a rider uncomfortable. I've done my best to follow his requested rules but when others seem to make the same mistake I did he purposefully misses the stop""). Good luck!"
That seemed like a much more hostile response and he's been on edge and quick to snap lately so I didn't want to provoke him. I tried to be gentle. 
"Don't try to do this without a lawyer. He's already being a jerk, so I wouldn't put it past him to be working with a lawyer himself &amp; getting his case ready while he tries to convince you that pursuing your own legal rights would be detrimental to you. "
"You promised her a place to stay, it wouldn't be right to just renege on that.  At the same time, you should lay down some ground rules - what is it you want from her?  Cooking in rotation?  Staying quiet?  Chipping in for groceries?

You have been given a very big sign. His behavior will only get worse once  you're married and imagine children (if you want them) in that situation.  I would try to have a conversation about it and i honestly would reconsider the wedding . He sounds very immature and I think you should try living together before getting married. It's much different When you see someone all the time. 
"You say you'd be okay with $10k max - offer them that. If they're anything less than EXTRAORDINARILY grateful and delighted, don't give them a penny. And remember, anything you give is a favour and you don't owe anyone a cent.

I have been saying for some time we should get some outside support (eg someone to mow the lawn, grocery delivery, a cleaner) as she has the money. However for example when we suggested she hire someone to mow the lawn she pouts and insists she would rather do it herself than spend her money. She will then call us in crisis saying that she tried to start the lawn mower but she fell now she's hurt can we come over then we end up taking it back over. Ugh. Your right though we can't keep this up forever. I need him to be firm. "
"Yeah, I'm going to echo the statements that your friend is sexually and likely romantically interested in you. You might view her as a sister, but she views you as something very different. 

It's not just the vibrator. It's her possessiveness over you. It's her homophobia (many people dealing with their sexuality try and throw off suspicions by claiming to hate gay people). It's her self destructive behavior, that is also not uncommon in people dealing with deep internal issues.

But she has crossed some very serious boundaries here. She likely took your $15 vibrator because in a way since it's yours, it's like you're fucking her. It's clearly not an issue of money, or privacy given the fact that you can order sex toys in discreet packaging online. 

If you don't want to address the issue with her, then you're going to have to at least put some distance between you and her, and better enforce your boundaries. You thought that you could trust her like a sister. Evidently not. You're going to need to treat her like someone who is trying to get into your pants."
"Do you have single mom at 28 fever as well?

Pretty sure this will be the update. 
"It sounds like you would have been invited on the trip with your boyfriend but that he sat on that information until you were locked into the trip with your friend. If that's true, then it sounds like he didn't actually want to visit Iceland with you, so he waited until you had made your own plans to announce his. I do think it's telling that he is visiting the same place as you, just on his own terms. It's not like he didn't want to go to Paris with you then chose to go to Japan with his friends, or something where it's drastically different. "
"I think you would benefit from talking to your wife about what kind of communication would make her feel more comfortable with your job. Putting in an effort to be totally transparent with her may go a long way to help her deal with this situation. You're not telling her because you want to spread gossip (make sure she knows that) but to keep her more involved in and aware of your life outside of home.

You may feel (as others do) that you're not doing anything wrong yourself so you shouldn't have to say anything to her. But this communication isn't for the purposes of ""coming clean"" or anything--it's to include and involve her in your thoughts, and help her feel more confident in your bond."
I've been on Citalopram/Celexa since May and this is a crock of SHIT. One of the side effects is your sex drive going DOWN. (Not that that happens to everyone.)
"So essentially, each and every time you guys fight you show her the door. And then you wonder why she's not happy with you? I didn't quite understand what her issue with your roommate is because your wording was a bit confusing/vague there, but I can certainly tell that there is some bad blood between them. Your gf's side of the story is that you've chosen cohabitating with someone who's wronged her in the past over living with her. And everytime she expresses concern over that choice, you let her know that you could take or leave the relationship anyway so she's free to bounce. 

Look, for all I know your gf is a horrid person. However, based on what little info I have here, I can see her point. Not that staying around and complaining is a productive way to solve this issue of course, but at this point, her options are, ultimatum or breakup. And both options will have breakup as the end result anyway. For whatever reason, you aren't acting like your relationship is a priority to you, so please try to understand that a partner who is serious about you is not going to be able to be happy this way.  "
"Talk. To. Him.

Also, falling asleep with headphones in doesn't mean anything. I'm and introvert and I can only fall asleep with talking on like an audiobook or tv show. I sleep with headphones with my SO as he likes white noise. It's just polite. And yes, family guy is sometimes my choice to fall asleep to. But I still get worn out in huge crowds. "
"You've gotta stop thinking in technicalities. You said it yourself, hes a private person and hes probably hurt. Thats pretty much all that matters now."
"You should move to your fathers. This environment isn't healthy for either of you and it's not okay for her to be screaming at her children for an hour.

Go, move and never look back.

Edit- father's not mother's"
"Get out of the car and knock on his door and ask him out for coffee or a drink in two days time. Or invite him and his son over for dinner some night. Keep it simple, easy and try to be casual about it. If there is mutual attraction, it will work out. You just might need to make the first moves. "
"My husband and I are both gamers. In fact we met in an MMORPG we used to play. So I know the issues here. 

My advice is to sit down with your husband and show him this Reddit post. Ask him to make a list of his priorities, rank them, then write down how much time he spends on activities throughout his day. How do they match up currently? How would he like for them to match up? 

The reason why you should show him this Reddit post is to force him to see himself through a neutral third-party perspective. He thinks you're being unreasonable because you are biased. Except that bias is that you love him, and it's the only reason he still has a wife. Other women would have gotten out of there already.

Well, as a gamer myself working full-time with two young kids, I know how it is. And I know when someone is playing too damn much video games (myself included!). I've had to cut back myself when I've gotten too into a game. 

These days with so much distractions all around us, our attention is everywhere. It can be easy to get sucked into something and neglect your friends and family and real life social connections. The thing about MMORPGs is that they also come with social connections that can make people feel obligated to play them and reinforce the addiction. That's why I quit guilds/social ties if I want to play less, and it works. 

My husband and I spend a lot of quality time together as a couple. We only get about two hours by ourselves in the evenings due to work and kids, and we take walks in the park, watch an episode of tv shows, and generally spend quality time together. Gaming should be at most an hour per day. If he can't set limits for himself, then he needs to either lose the game altogether or be prepared to lose his wife.

8 years ago I made a Reddit post somewhat like this, and I showed it to my then boyfriend. He is now my husband, and we have been happily together ever since. Honest and open communication is key. Good luck."
"I don't actually think you are gaslighting her based on what you wrote here.

I *do*, however, think that you're almost certainly dismissing her feelings, invalidating her, and not listening. When you make a mistake, you apologize. You made a mistake, she got upset, and all you do is try to explain your ""side"" and refuse to say you're sorry? I'd be angry with you, too. 

Edit: I'm not trying to say she isn't also at fault here. Y'all desperately need to learn how to communicate."
"People throw the word divorce around like it means nothing; just saying that would get me angry enough. Empty threats, selfishness, and laziness are grounds for serious concerns. I would suggest therapy, but you seem to be already tight with $. So, a serious conversation is needed here. Perhaps you grew up to become very different people who want different things? That was my case in my divorce. Unfortunately, you're going to have to keep bringing up the subject and try to stay patient and be the bigger person when she throws a fit. If you try and she continues to be set in her selfish ways and refuses to compromise, then you can consider some time apart to get her a reality check."
"Shortly after I paid it, it was like a big moment of clarity. Of how much i am willing to do for this idiot and how little he is willing to do for me. His big claim to being a good boyfriend is that he ""invites me to family functions."" and to ""ride in the golf cart with him while he plays."" "

"I can't imagine any situation where your girlfriend asks you to go on vacation to Place A, and you say you don't want to go or cant.  And then a little bit later, you agree to go to Place A with another woman.

I mean, what the actual fuck is this guy thinking?  I have thought and thought about this but I can not for the life of me come up with any explanation other than he wants to bone this other chick and he is trying to see if she is interested before he breaks things off with OP"
"&gt; How can I trust him not to just ""forget"" important stuff once our baby is born? Will he just leave chokable things around? Forget to make sure chemicals are out of reach? Forget to close the baby gate on the stairs?

Those are very legitimate concerns.  Have you expressed those exact concerns to him?  If so, how did he respond?  If not, go talk to him and lay it all out.  You're worried that his forgetfulness and lack of ability to take responsibility for managing himself is going to put your child at risk.  It's not stupid, it's not silly, and he cannot brush it off.

My fiance has ADHD.  It's well managed, and part of that management is a system that combines him setting reminders for himself and practicing mindfullness (including meditation and various other mental exercises), and me reminding him about certain things without him being allowed to get mad about it.  I do not monitor him constantly, but since we're a partnership, I am willing to help.  But it should just be you HELPING and him doing the bulk of the work to correct this serious issue."
"Yikes. None of what you've described is appropriate... and not washing his hands after fingering you and then possibly touching your child? Yuck. I agree with a previous poster, you need therapy to help define boundaries and explain to him what's wrong. "
He's a crap Dad. Start facing facts. 
"That's the crux of the issue really. He want's his dad's approval, affection, attention. You got it so effortlessly. It's probably an ugly mixture of jealousy, grief, sadness, and anger at seeing someone he loved get the attention he personally wants."
"Assuming that your faith in the co-worker isn't misplaced...

Given that your husband is military and working on high-security sites, it may be that he is trying to put extra protection around the information by giving you a false location. It may not be you he concerned about. For instance, there may be someone around you who he suspects, but cannot prove, of trying to get seemingly-benign information out of you. Or maybe it's someone else, like someone getting close to his mother (for instance) but he feels that you have to get the same false information so you don't have to lie to her or accidentally let the cat out of the bag.

Given that you are confident he is not cheating and there is nothing untoward going on in relation to the marriage itself, just talk to him. Ask him whether there is someone around you that you need to be careful about, or some reason you need to increase the precautions you are currently taking about keeping information private."
"Breaking up is probably for the best. She's got to need lot of support during pregnancy, and you don't seem cut out for that. If you leave, she doesn't have to waste time counting on you then being disappointed. Instead she can start building up a support system for her and her baby."
Go back to HR. They will probably facepalm pretty hard if they were already sick of her last time. 
I really hope that scaramucci becomes a verb for completely firebombing your own job in record time.
"She's working upwards to 60 hours a week and you can't understand why she doesn't go to the gym, eat healthy and put on make up?"
"&gt;her parents gave her €1000 on one of those prepaid cards to buy some stuff like a bag and makeup as a 'pick me up' since being a new mom is stressful and she has been given tons of things for the baby but no presents for herself.

Sorry, dude. I was ready to side with you based on your title, but this was a gift for your wife specifically so she could treat herself. The money was for her and her alone. Unless you're struggling to make ends meet, she had no reason to spend it on anything but herself.

Would you be pissed if they gave her the bag and lipstick directly? Would you demand that she sell it and use the money on the family?

Being a new mom is hard. Let her have this."
