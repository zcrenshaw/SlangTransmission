"The reality is, as things are now, you can either have a relationship with your wife or your son. Your wife's views may be popular where you live, but that does not make them right. 

Please support your son. "
"&gt;Oh also, I'm Indian. If any fellow Indians have dealt with aunties and uncles acting like this.

Oh, believe me they're putting you down because their own kids are not going your way at such a young age. They're jealous as hell and putting you down to soothe their own egos. It's time for you to feel smug as hell whenever they make comments because your success is making them seethe. Don't talk to them much about your job but if they persistent turn the conversation to your their kids. "
"It would come off as creepy if you were her acquaintance. It comes off as awesome since you're her boyfriend. Romantic, caring, and a great present. "
The change just cements that he's not clueless. He knows exactly what it takes to be a partner worth sticking around for but was too selfish to do it until now when he thought he might lose you. 
"What in the actual fuck did I just read... 

No don't start a family with this man. "
"&gt;She thinks that I should pay for every single meal, in addition to the gifts that I get her, because it is what all of her exes did and ""the standard that [she's] used to.""

You should make it a point to be the first ex of hers who didn't treat her this way, ASAP. "
"So, in other words, there's a dumpster on fire at your doorstep and you want to know if you should roll it inside?"
"I've seen a lot of answers here similar to those that I found incredibly unhelpful in my (similar) situation.  Many are a combination of ""why were you with him in the first place?"" with just a touch of ""what's wrong with you?""  from a person who has no idea about the complexity of the issues involved.   When an addict you love relapses (or, as is often the case, you suspect relapse but can't yet confirm it) it's hard to know what to do.   Anyone who says this has an easy answer doesn't understand.  

To the commenters who suggest just leaving him, what about the fact that she can't yet confirm what's happened?  And they've had a happy relationship until now? And that people recover? And they have a baby together?   And can she even leave right now?  Can she support herself?   Does she have a plan?   These things aren't solved in a day.  For me, even though I kicked him out the day he relapsed, it was a year and a half and three treatments later before we finally split up.  It's just not always that easy. 

And to those who say she is being too harsh- have you ever lived with an addict who is using?  Do you have any idea what that's like?   How you can tell something is just wrong with your spidey-sense a mile away?  And have you considered how bad it can be?   How it can go from zero to shitshow in a matter of hours? From time my husband would disappear to when the bank account would be cleared out was a matter of minutes.  I had to cut him off from every  account and change every lock to keep him from spending/selling it all.  Even with all that, thousands of dollars went out the door that our family needed and that I'll never recover. 

This stuff is hard.  When it happened to me, I was out of my mind and just needed support from my friends.  No suggestions.  No comments.  What I needed was ""I'm sorry. What  can I do to help?"" And for people to trust that I could make my own decisions about what to do and to not judge if I made mistakes and had to change course. 

We're divorced now.  He's sober again. Kids and I are good.  So it gets better.  But seriously- the ""simple"" answers couldn't be less helpful.  "
"You told him that you're scared of him because of his anger, and he blamed your sex life and accused you of being a secret lesbian.

He has no interest in trying to work this out or improve himself.  He even suggested that you leave rather than even consider changing himself.  

You're making the right decision.  There's no reason to hang on longer to try to make it work, and lots of reasons to get out now.  

It'll be hard at first, but you're only 27.  You have a good job, plenty of resources, and it sounds like a solid family.  You've got lots of time to find companionship."
He stopped over because he thinks your are cheating. He sounds paranoid and it's  time to move on. 
"I think, to be safe, you change the locks first.

Next, you have the conversation in public. With people around. In the day time.

Tell him, in short, definitive sentences, any variations of these that work for you. ""I'm ending this. Your behaviour makes me uncomfortable. I don't want to be with someone with such unstable emotions. I'm sorry that your are dealing with these issues from your childhood, and I hope you work them out. I'm don't want to date you because your emotional volatility makes me feel unsafe.""

Things like that. He will demand justification and examples, and try to explain things away. Tell him you're not interested in his explanations. If he gets desperate, he might promise to change. The sort of change he needs requires a lot of personal development with a therapist.

You might come off pretty unfeeling and cold, he may try to paint you as an awful person for not trying to support him through his ""time of need."" But that is an extension of controlling behaviour that borders on gas lighting.

It's manipulation. It's control. And better that you withstand a BS guilt trip and simply say no, than fall under the train wreck. Coz it will seriously get worse."
"You need to tell him flat out. Sit him down and lay it down.

""The amount of time you spend at the gym and the extreme dieting is impacting our relationship. I am not happy. I feel alone in our relationship. I don't want to start trying for kids while I feel like I am a lower priority to you."""
"""Let me remind you that you did this. Not me. I deleted it as requested, but for some reason you can't let it go. Your mistake is not my responsibility."""
"One of the big realizations of growing up is that your parents are just people with their own set of flaws and baggage. As you make your own way in the world and find out how hard it all is, you'll probably come around to a more charitable view of them. "
"I remember your post. I'm so glad that you were able to connect with your sister and that she was deceived by your parents.

I would be *very*, *very* cautious about connecting with your mother. She hasn't reached out to you directly with a huge apology, and there is probably a reason for that. Plus she is still physically living with your abuser.

Spend some time reconnecting with your sister. Years, perhaps. Put a foundation in place. See what happens with your mom over time but BE. CAREFUL.

I wish you well and lots of happiness."
"Wait. I just want to make sure I have this correct:

Your girlfriend is *crying*  because she got the designer handbag she wanted and your sister is getting an international trip. She cites this as proof that you love a blood relative more than someone you've been dating for 365 days.

**RUN FOR THE HILLS, MATE.**  Any girl who is jealous of your sister is bad news."

"*Wife, I am not going to be the kind of man who tells you who you can and can not be friends with, but the truth is...your friendship with Jim has crossed the line from friendship to emotional affair.  You admit you flirt with him.  You admit you have a crush on him.  And your relationship with this man makes your coworkers uncomfortable because they know both of you are married.  And honestly, the only 2 people who don't seem to know that this friendship is actually an emotional affair is you and Jim.*

*I have no idea how to handle this situation, but I do know that you need to recognize and accept that you are actively stepping outside the boundaries of our marriage vows and your actions are not only hurting me, they are hurting this marriage.*

*Now I am not telling you to stop being friends with this man, and I am not telling you you have to quit your job.  You are an adult and I am never going to tell you what to do.  But you need to take a step back and really look at what you are doing.  I do trust that nothing physical has happened, but emotional cheating is just as bad as physical cheating...and yes, you are emotionally cheating on me.*

*It's up to you to repair the trust in this marriage.  And it's up to you to talk to Jim about the nature of your friendship and how it is affecting both of your marriages.*"
"&gt;    I also said, ""she's even better than my dad,"" at which point I looked at him, but he tried to wave me away/ shush me and quickly said that yeah we don't need to mention that. 

You threw him a huge bone. A huge opening to step in and say ""it's true, my amazing- and Asian- wife is a much better driver than me!  So much for stereotypes!"" or whatever. 

He deflected. 

Defending his wife and children isn't ""worth mentioning"".

"
"Its over man. Simply respond with:

*Understood. Thanks for the memories. You know how to reach me if you are ever in town. Good luck in (insert city/job).* 

Honestly, ***keep it short and sweet.*** She does not want to hear your reasons, attempts to try again, false promises, etc. 

Then off all contact. It'll be tough but the sooner you take steps to move on the better it'll be in the long run. Trust me. "
"You didn't take off, you turned down an extra shift for which you weren't already scheduled. *Don't feel guilty about that.* Work/life balance is very healthy, and skipping social engagements to pick up extra shifts isn't necessary.

I think this has more to do with your grandparents not wanting you to visit your real mom.

You're a grown up and are in charge of your own social life and your own job."
"Your parents could not be more of an example of ""crabs in a bucket"" if they tried. They will not be satisfied until they have dragged you down to their level, and honestly, I'd bet they won't even be happy then. You could become Kylie Jenner 2.0 and you still will always be ""the one who thought she was going to go to Europe and be a snob"".

So, you know what? If you're gonna do the time, you might as well do the crime. Go to Europe and live the dream. I think it would be a tragedy if you crushed your own dreams to satisfy your miserable parents. "

"Something tells me that the way your Australian family is treating you about this is exactly why your mom wanted to move back to Japan. Mute/block them, or don't share things with them on social media, and have fun living your life."

"My favorite comeback line (I found it on reddit, of course):

""Most people just say congratulations""."
"I was so prepared to tell you not to worry too much until:

&gt; Despite all this she was crying and admitted to having a crush on him 

&gt; also admitted Jim and his wife’s marriage has been rough for a long time and he confided in her

Nope nope nope. 

Here's the thing, the ""work spouse"" thing itself means almost nothing except that they are close. I had a ""work wife"" at a job once and it really was just a friend thing. I don't think your wife would have used that term is they were already having an affair.

But your wife IS crushing on him. And they're talking about their relationships. That's literally how every ""it just happened"" cheating with a coworker story starts. 

I don't really know what the solution is though, normally she should just reduce contact but they sit together in an office all day and eat together. I think she should try to find a new job and in the meantime you get complete phone access. 

Also, you should tell her to cool it in the office because if other people are coming to you with it then you know its gossip around the office and since they are the HR people it looks really bad. An upper level manager might get wind of it and decide they can't have their HR people acting so inappropriately and then she's fired."
"Personally, I do think you're overreacting a bit as there's nothing inherently wrong with hanging out with a friend of the opposite gender alone in your house. Plus he was honest about it. But now that it's happened and you feel uncomfortable with it, talk to him and see if you guys can agree on some boundaries going forward that work for both of you. It's not super hard to avoid bringing friends of the opposite sex home while your SO isn't there and without letting them know first, so see if you guys can both agree not to do that going forward and come up with a compromise. 

There's not a lot you can do about what happened but at least you guys can agree on some ground rules going forward so everyone's comfortable.  

Edit to add: I know that you're going to get a ton of ""this is literally the end of the world and he definitely cheated on you"" type comments here as that's just the nature of the sub, but please try to take them all with a grain of salt. If you trust your husband and have no prior issues there's no reason you should believe that as fact. Just throwing that out there."
"&gt;  I don't want to go. What's happened every other time is just going to happen again. I'm going to walk around and try to talk to them. I'll be borderline ignored. I'll wind up finding a seat and talking to my friends or sister on Facebook. If Juliet doesn't talk to me then I'm on my own. I wouldn't mind spending 4th of July with her. It's just, her friends.

So tell her this and don't accept ""give them time"" as an answer.

You are stuck in this situation with her friends and she's not addressing it. Until she does, make other plans."
"&gt;I should mention that he doesn't ever do errands for me (if I ask, he rolls his eyes and complains.)

don't set a date for the wedding until you get him to see his hypocrisy here. otherwise, you'll spend your entire life as his bang-maid. sit him down and tell him exactly the things you've said in this post."
Tell your father. He has a right to know what he is getting into. 
"Is your husband 12? 

Omg. This is so disgusting and awful. How could you do that to someone you're supposed to love? You're not his little brother, you're his wife. 

I'm not sure I could get past that. "
"...He bought you a birthday present with a gift card that you gave to his son as his birthday present. You bought yourself a birthday present and he ""signed the card"". That tells you all you need to know about this dude's character IMO"

Both."
Tell your dad you heard her talking about excluding your sister. See what he thinks about it.

"&gt;My SM had the great idea of telling mom that the white would match SM's dress and be good because it's popular for brides to now wear a dress in the wedding colors

"I'm a married woman (7 years) with a few male friends and several close male co workers.  So I'm not against opposite sex friends, but I think there are a few points here:

1) It is inappropriate to blow kisses and wink at work.  As an HR professional, you would think she would understand how that comes across.  If I worked with her and saw the blowing kisses routine, I would feel like I couldn't go to her with help for sexual harassment, as she obviously thinks that a sexual/ flirtatious atmosphere is appropriate at work.  If she doesn't care about her reputation as your wife, she should care about her professional relationship.

2) A friendship that intense is just strange.  Eating two meals a day together five days a week is a lot for a married person."
" Hi there. 

First off, I think it's amazing you're so concerned for your mom. A lot of people would just shrug it off and try to ignore it. You're a good kid. 

I'm a hair younger than your mom and I'm a military wife too. My husband doesn't deploy for as long, but he does deploy. 

I can sympathize with your mom. Wen he's gone, a huge part of my heart is gone and its a big transition. You go from having a coparent to help, only to have everything on your shoulders. You do become a single parent for almost a year. That's scary, and hard to deal with sometimes. Being a parent is hard and scary enough with two people doing it. 

So, my advice is to talk to her.  Ask her if she's okay because you heard her crying. Try to be helpful and tell your dad when you get the chance. 

Best wishes. "
That would get someone fired in a professional environment

"&gt;I knew my mother was bad but the idea that she was treating Aurora like this or possibly anyone else is unsettling. 

My sincere hope for you is that you figure out why you find it acceptable for your mom to treat you like this and don't distance yourself from her, but her treating other people in the same way is so unsettling to you. 

As for what to do here, it seems perfectly reasonable for your mom to plan the shower by herself and for your friend to just show up as a guest and not help plan anything. She's not obligated. If your mom wants help just either lie to her and tell her your friend is unable to help or be straight with her and tell her that her disgusting wedding behavior made her not want to help."
"Also, turn this around on her. She's upset because her church friends will look down at her for having a gay son. She can either have a gay son or a divorce. Her choice. "
"As someone recovering from an eating disorder, this request is inappropriate.  The reality of the situation is that his sister will regularly see thin people and collar bones.  It is not these people's responsibilities to hide their bodies, much less impossible.  You should talk to your boyfriend and have him talk to their parents. If she is serious about recovery, she needs to accept the fact that there are people of all shapes and sizes.  She needs to work with her therapist and accept that.  Recovering from an eating disorder is hard (the hardest thing I've done) but that doesn't allow her or anyone to make unreasonable requests. "
"**Repeat, on endless loop ""I have moved on with my life.""**

If necessary add (in a hurt voice): ""Has everyone forgotton how (a) she utterly broke my heart and (b) how she didnt even call for 4 years?""

Dont be afraid to leave the room or hang up if they keep on about it.


*By the way: ""Didn't even let her into my home""
 - was a good call.*"
"That is 100% an overreaction on his part. Banging on the door or coming to try to find you, sure. But breaking in and shaking you awake is terrifying? "
"Leave her alone and absolutely do not try to break into the bathroom.  Whatever's going on with her, that would only escalate the situation and make it worse."
"Hmmm there's a woman posting about how her husband thought it was funny to make ice cubes from his pee for her to drink for two weeks. 

Perhaps your gf and her husband could get together and have the most magical shit and pee filled life ever?"
"Noooooooope. 

That is really fucked up. She cannot disinvite only one of her fiancee's kids. "
She is unreasonable in asking you to cater to her mental issues.
"People are really tearing you down for this, but I understand why it's weird. If your parents are paying for your therapy sessions, then your aunt's check made out to the therapist probably feels like more of a gift to your parents, who now don't have to pay for two of your sessions, than a gift to you, since you're already guaranteed the sessions. It also probably feels like your aunt is dictating how you use your gift, since you either give the check to the therapist or forfeit the money. 

Instead of looking at it as not getting a gift for yourself, maybe try to think of it as a nice little reprieve for your parents, who are likely paying hundreds of dollars a month for your sessions. Just because they can cover it doesn't mean it's not expensive, &amp; it's really great that they're taking on this expense for their (technically adult) child so you can have a better shot at a healthy adult life. 

The reason people are being harsh is because as you transition to adulthood, you need to start taking responsibility for yourself &amp; your own expenses. Also because you aren't owed birthday gifts as an adult person, so those will probably phase out. (Again, just because your aunt is rich doesn't mean she owes you birthday money.) And instead of saying, ""Oh, okay, I can help my parents out here to pay for a few sessions"" you said, ""This is bullshit, someone else is already paying my way on these sessions, so I'm sending this check back. Sorry, parents, I'm not going to use this to help you out at all."" Eventually, you will probably need to pay for your own sessions, &amp; when you do, you will appreciate the gravity of what hundreds of dollars each month feels like. "
"My husband behaved with a particular video game the way you've behaved with this hobby. The first years of our marriage were him at a computer ignoring me. So much so that when I went to the bathroom to take a pregnancy test, he hopped on the computer, and when I came out with the positive stick in hand he said ""hang on, I gotta finish this raid."" 

He quit for 10 years. He recently asked if he could play, and I gave the green light thinking he's grown so much more mature and responsible surely he can recognize and balance things now. 

In less than two weeks it was right back to ignoring me for this game. We've been married for 15 years and he's jeopardizing it because he can't control himself and balance it with me and the kids. I'm waiting a couple weeks more to bring it up in case it's just an initial excitement burst.

You are an addict. Your obsession with this hobby took over and jeopardized your job and your relationship and you were unable to balance your life. You can be proud of one year, or you can realize that you've spent a year being mentally stressed by this addiction. You can be pissed at your wife, or you can realize that you put her in the position of having to be your mother and say no, rather than recognizing and controlling your behavior on your own. You can be proud of keeping your promise, except for that part where you didn't within three weeks of your wedding."
"&gt;I can't risk losing him

Regardless of the whatever else is going on - yes, you absolutely can. There are billions of men in the world. "
"Do at least listen to his story. 

If it stinks, based on his past history of doung this, end it."
Run girl run. The hell. Why would you marry a man like this. Do you have no self esteem? Divorce and find someone so much better.
Your boyfriend is a bigger piece of shit than your car. 
"I am friends with some exes and am upfront and open about that when I start something new. However, I've never lied about anything involving them, and when I hang out with them it's usually with the new person I'm seeing.

Don't lie to people you want to keep in your life. "
"You know how some kids have braces to straighten crooked teeth? 

When they get older, and someone tells them they have a nice smile, do you think they have a social obligation to respond with ""thanks, but I had braces""? 

When they start dating, do you think it needs to be ""disclosed"" to their partner that they had braces at one point?

It's like that. "
"I would wait until you have conclusive results one way or the other.  Bringing it up *before* you have certainty opens the door to speculation, and if (for instance) she thinks you're accusing her of cheating when it turns out that it's HSV1, there may be no going back, because the implication is already out there.

It's waited this long.  It can wait long enough to be certain."
"Wow. That's a bombshell. Before you do anything, take some time to cool off and really think about what you want the outcome here to be. Do you want them to let you date that 19 yo? Do you want them to stop being hypocritically conservative? Do you want things to remain the way they are?

Keep in mind that using this as some kind of leverage can backfire and damage your relationship. It's unlikely they will change any behavior at all even after you reveal that you know the truth. If you are depending on their financial support dropping this bombshell on them may not be worth it at all. "
"There's nothing wrong with screaming when someone forces your pants off and makes unwanted advances. Jesus. I'd have screamed too, right before kicking him in the head for being an asshole."
"You need a friend or family member who will be candid with you. Something does jive here - the way you describe yourself and your house does not strike me as something that should make someone uncomfortable and yet this is becoming a common thing for you. 

Call up someone who you think you can really trust and put yourself out there. Explain you're looking for a TRULY honest answer to this question. Say you're flabbergasted that you've made guests uncomfortable, that they seem to feel you're 'too neat' and that they cannot be comfortable in your house and even aren't willing to have you over to theirs, and that you want to know what you're doing to cause this. 

Possibly it is nothing - there is nothing wrong with being neat and taking care in your home! - but with multiple people saying the same, it is worth getting to the bottom of this."
I would go 100% scorched earth over this. No fucks given. My marriage would be over. I'd consider forcing me to imbibe bodily fluids to be abuse.
"What the fuck?... what...  what the fuck is wrong with your fucking husband???

"Honestly, there's no way to say, ""I feel your current chosen hairstyle will ruin my wedding photos"" without it sounding pretty much exactly like that. If you want her to have her hair professionally colored so it looks better in your photos, then I think you need to be willing to cover that cost fully. You can't tell someone they don't look good enough to be in your wedding photos &amp; that you expect them to pay to fix it themselves. You can try to tell her that you're treating both of you to a color session prior to the wedding to ensure your colors are vivid for photos, but she can probably still read between those lines. "
"Be bored with it.

Don't go out of your way to refute her, just perfect a raised eyebrow and ""Yeah, she's been saying that a lot."" If they ask for more details, just say ""I didn't give her a job reference because I don't really know her. Now she's pissed off."" and change the subject to something more interesting."
"You didn't spend the last decade of your life on stupid bullshit. A decade ago you were 13. You spent it *growing up*.

"That's great! Frame it as you want to treat her as a thank you for being your bridesmaid, that you know she's been saving money doing her hair herself and that you want to gift her with having it done professionally at a salon. "
"If I were you, I would hire a private investigator to try to find her. If you can find a good one, they are super good at inventing pretexts to get info out of people, and they may be able to get to the bottom of it.  If you can find out where she is, you can try to see her. 

The sad fact is that she is a minor and your parents do have legal control of her. If you can find her, maybe you can try to bust her out, help her apply to be an emancipated minor, etc.. What an awful situation. "
"Well, all I can tell you is that this would *absolutely* be reason enough for me to leave my partner or at least separate, contingent on family counseling, etc. Her treatment of your son is shocking, and I fully believe that parental rejection of this kind is the reason that rates of mental illness and suicide are so much higher in the LGBT population. Do you live in a very conservative area?"
"Just be firm. When she flirts again, make it clear that you're really not into it. She's putting herself out there, so if she sees a look of mild disgust and gets a stern word from you, she'll probably stop.

"&gt;He claims that I could turn out to be a bitch in 2 years

That would've been the end for me.  What a nasty comment to say to someone you supposedly love. It's perfectly normal to start talking about your future together within the first couple of years of a relationship. Even as vague as ""do you want kids? By a particular date?"" Is pretty standard and needed information to know the relationship is headed in a direction both of you want."
"I feel you are seriously underreacting.

This is a big, big deal. He shows his lack of respect and caring for you. This is extremely disturbing as well as gross.

"YES. Pakistani here. Being female makes it all the more worse. I don't work in a big company, but I do deal with economic research. People find a way to either make my job seem like something super easy and dumb, or they like to randomly mention how I ""won't be working for long"", as if this is some lame hobby and not a job. A lot of aunties also randomly suggest that I take a week off work as if it's no big deal (they'd never say that to a guy). 

Hang in there, this is a South Asian auntie/uncle thing. Like the commenter above said, it's just jealousy. "

"1) a month doesn't sound bad on the engineering job front if you are getting interviews. Our hiring process is about a quarter here. In hindsight you should have started half a year ago, but adulting doesn't come with a manual and your doing pretty good. (That wasn't meant to be naggy)

2) if you can get an engineering degree you can tuck in your shirt and get a minimum wage job. The turnover is huge at those places someone is always hiring. You don't have to if you are not having money trouble but the way you quickly dismissed it as too hard is silly

3) You are going to have to move out of the small town when you get your job so this absolutely effects your relationship. She probably wants to know where you are going and if she wants to or can go.   "
"Your sister is the minor problem. The major problem is that you guys have let your relationship get really stale. (The no sex for 7 months is a horrible red flag.) 

I would find an excuse to get him away from the house for a weekend and start working at rebonding with him. You need to start having sex again and have a regular date night. What he's doing isn't good, but if you try to fix the symptoms without fixing the underlying problem (you guys aren't doing the things that keep a couple strong) it will just get worse. "
"Your reaction is understandable and quite frankly common, and I think that it's a symptom of a bigger problem. Your husband has put 0 effort into your relationship the entire time, and now that you're standing up for yourself he's back tailing and trying to get you to stay. I try my best to give neutral advice, but this is a case I've heard all too often. Let's be real about this. He ain't gonna change. We both know that. If you give him another chance, this will last a week or two, a month at most, before he'll give up and go back to how things were. He's getting all he needs from you and doesn't respect you enough to meet your reasonable needs. If you take him back, it's no different than giving a child a treat after they throw a tantrum. It will simply teach him that all he needs to do is make false expectations/promises to keep you just close enough to stay, then go back to how things are, rinse and repeat.

Be selfish. When you get married, it is like lifting a sofa. It takes two parties to put into consistence and continued effort. You are lifting the sofa and he is not. And when you start putting the sofa down and walking away, he starts lifting and promising he will help, only to put it back down again and continue wasting your time.

Do not be with someone who cannot respect you enough to give you the bare minimum of what you need. You should be allowed to feel wanted emotionally, sexually, physically. You should be swept off your feet sometimes, loved equally, and treated with love. Your husband treats you like a slave, you don't deserve that. I guarentee you there are a million guys out there that will treat you better than this, and frankly you deserve it. Showing your partner you love them, pleasing them and respecting them is not a mountainous task. It is a small but consistent effort. He does not respect you enough to even do that. It takes nothing to tell your partner you love them, to give them a foot massage on a bad day, to surprise them with a little treat now and then, to celebrate and support one another, and to please them sexually. My partner and I don't even have to think about it, we just do it. When he's down, I'm there without thinking. When I'm feeling blue, he's always got my back. Heck, I would say that's the bare minimum for a healthy relationship.

Don't live your life in regret. Don't delude yourself on his false promises. In my honest opinion, counselling will do nothing. Therapy won't work for him. Because he's already decided how much effort he wants to put in, and that's just enough to keep you around but not enough to make you happy. Find someone who loves you and SHOWS you that by respecting you. Take some time out to have 'me time'. Drink wine, eat popcorn, watch your favourite movie. Maybe get a hotel room for a couple days and let him know you need space to think, then turn your phone on silent. Really think things over, and realise that you deserve to feel loved, wanted and respected. It might not be an easy choice, but I think we both know what the right decision for the long run is.

I'm here all day if you need to talk/vent"
"&gt; I think I need to be single for a while and just focus on therapy.

I think this is the right choice. I'm sorry things did not work out for you &amp; Allie; I really hate to see anyone's marriage break up. But I'm glad that you are taking responsibility for your role in all this, and making concrete plans to change. It takes guts to admit you were wrong.

I wish you all the best, OP."
"That ""2 year fertility window"" sounds a little fishy. Are you sure she's not just trying to lock you down and get a more permanent status?"
"Red flags...how do I see thee? Let me count the ways.

1) You both have different ideas about how money should be spent. You lean conservative she wants the expensive apartment even though she can't really afford it. 

2) She offered to pay for ""etc"" and when you told her that you could not afford that arrangement, she immediately turned it emotional and referenced old relationships. 

3) She took your private issues public. Even worse, she is giving you motives that she cannot know that you have to make you look bad in front of people you will ostensibly need to continue to have relationships with. She is salting the earth behind her even though she needs to continue living on this earth. This is an unstable person. 

4) Claims you would ""love"" her more if she was a ""pretty blonde girl"" This is passive-aggressive nonsense at its finest.

5) Claims you don't ""value"" her because you won't pay her way. This is not a definition of value that a healthy person holds. 

Like others have said, ignore this at your peril. You won't have an easier time to end this. She has shown you who she is. Believe her."
"My stepmom had my sister at 41 and my brother at 43, completely naturally. Her favourite comeback to presumptuous questions about their conception was ""an old uterus is a bold uterus"" accompanied by a wink. I'm sure she'd be happy to lend it to you. 

Also, on the all-too-frequent occasions that some busy body asked me about how my stepmom got pregnant, my answer was ""Well, I sleep next door, so I can pretty conclusively say it was from having sex with my Dad. But I have an iPod now, so that's nice."" 

People are fucking rude. Asking about your children's conception is really just an extension of the entitlement and invasiveness that prompts the unsolicited belly touching. Find whatever way is funniest to you, and continue merrily shutting it down. "
"If the only reason you want an open relationship is to fuck his best friend, then I think you shouldn't do it. You'd end up destroying a friendship and a marraige."
"He's 32, already has a kid he didn't want, and yet still didn't want to wrap his dick up when having sex with you. This is not a man who learns from his mistakes. He just wants the ability to whatever he wants with no consequences. 


Block his number, block every social media account he has, don't respond to anything he sends you except for one single ""stop contacting me or I'll get in touch with the police."" If he continues, log all of your interactions with him so you have a record for a potential restraining order. "
"It's quite possible that she simply starts to type the website name into Google and it pulled up the link to your profile since she viewed it once before and she clicks on that to get to the website. So while it looks like she's looking at your profile particularly she's really just inadvertently using your profile to open the website. 

I do lazy shit like that literally all the time because I detest having to many apps. "
"Who stayed home the last time you couldnt feasibly get a babysitter for a social occasion?

If the answer is you, go out and have fun.

If the answer is your wife, I think you need to do the decent thing and offer to let her go and you stay with the kids."
"Screaming at you, telling you to shut the fuck up, and blocking you from leaving a room are all red flags for abusive behavior.  Is that how he normally treats you when you don't do what he wants?"
"Work on moving out as soon as you can. It sucks, but this amount of stuff isn't something you can get her to stop doing by just talking about it. 

In the meantime, do everything you can to separate your life from your mom's. When she's not home, move all the clothes of yours that she's taken back into your room, then lock the door. Keep it locked any time you aren't in it. See if you can get your bank to stop sending you physical statements. Your bank probably has an app with similar functionality. 

You sound really good with your money, so you should be able to figure out a way to convert some of that savings into rent money for an apartment. Good luck. "
"This is appropriate for ten months.  It was a bunch of time but not a bunch of money, and relates to her childhood.

Also you are close enough with her family that you are doing yardwork for her mother.  I can't imagine you overstepped any boundaries here.

Good luck!  I bet she'll love it :)"
"You can try to say something like, ""I understand this is something your exes did, but I am interested in a relationship where we both pay for things."" But I suspect this is a much bigger incompatability. She wants someone to be the breadwinner for her &amp; to treat her like a princess; you want to be equal partners where you share expenses. If these are your long-term outlooks for both of you, it's better to walk away from this situation now instead of continuing to argue about it. "
"The part where she decides whether to have him in her life *is* her life.  She's correct about that.

But the part where you get to say ""I won't have anything to do with him for reasons"" is *your* life.

Draw your boundaries where you need to draw your boundaries.  You're not forbidding her from getting back with him.  You're just stating what *you* will do if she does."

"Going on the basis of what you have described, it sounds like your Ex was looking for something that wasn't there and was determined to find 'evidence' that you are cheating. It sounds like it was a lose/lose situation for you.

I would just let it go. You are probably right to be worried for him, in that he is behaving in a destructive way that could undermine his future relationships if he can't get a handle on it. 

You don't owe him anything, you are not obligated to save him from himself."
"Heart goes out to Allie.

I think you are right when you say that you need to be single and work on yourself. She has sacrificed so much to make your marriage work that if I were her I don't think I could ever stop resenting you for it--especially, ESPECIALLY when reading a paper full of you resenting me for things like ""budgeting"" when your lack of a budget resulted in her starving. It's clear how much you are hurting knowing she read that, but all you can do to feel better is to be a better person in the future.

Best of luck. Keep up with therapy. Do not beg her back."

"""No, mom. The inheritance was divided equally between us, and you chose what to do with your half. Mine is not available. Let's find a financial advisor to help you manage the remaining 500k.""

You seem very concerned with being *nice* and not hurting your mom's feelings. I honestly don't think you should be concerned beyond standard decency. Just say no. It's completely unreasonable for her to expect you to bail her out of her bad money management, or to feel entitled to your share as well as her own. If your mother's feelings are hurt because you refuse to give her a handout to waste, that's on her, not you. "
"Send out a group email/text (do you even have contact info for these women) ""Hey guys, today is the last day for me to cancel without penalty. I need everyone to get their $$$ to me by 4pm or I'll have to cancel the trip."""
"You haven't got married, you've just adopted a baby.

TBH, I really don't know how you've tolerated this for so long.

Your husband has mental health issues, and should be seen by a doctor immediately.

&gt; He's not a stupid guy, he went to uni, got a good degree

There are lots of jobs you can do remotely, especially in the computing field. He should probably try some."
"Oh hell no.  You don't know most of these girls very well, you're paying for the whole thing, and she's calling it your birthday trip?  Yeah right.  Looks like someone wanted an excuse to go to Vegas with her friends and your birthday was a convenience excuse.  I would cancel the trip.  They can re-book on their own cards if they're genuine about going as your birthday trip.  If you're feeling generous, give them until the end of today to pay up.  But if you leave for the trip on Friday without doing anything, I can pretty much guarantee you they will never pay you back."

"Do not apologize. He's not a fucking child and you're not responsible for waking him up when he oversleeps. 

Does he act like this all the time? He sounds like a total ass."
"&gt; Now a person claiming to be his mom is texting me from his phone number, saying that he tried to kill himself last night. (How) can I figure out what's actually going on?

1. It's him, not his mom.  It's not even plausible that it might be anything else; you already know he's manipulative, and it's absurd to imagine his mother is going through her son's phone and texting random people to try and guilt trip them.  It's him.
2. What's going on is he's an enormous asshole who stole your debit card and is now trying to guilt trip, probably as some sort of bizarre attempt at dating you again.
3. Your next steps should be blocking him and filing a police report, in whatever order you feel like, but preferably promptly."
"First off, I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for being accepting of your son. What he did in coming out to you both was so incredibly brave and was probably the single most terrifying thing he's had to do. He needs and ally and refuge here, and to have it in the form of his father is truly the most wonderful thing you can do for him. 

On the flip side, your wife is completely out of line. No religious beliefs should incite hatred and abuse. Personally, I would leave my spouse in your situation. If you choose to leave, please know that you are doing so for a very good reason. The same goes for if you have to sever relationships with certain family members, friends, or co-workers. Not only is it the ""just"" and ""right"" side to be on, but it is also the side of your son. "
You two are incompatible.  Simple as that.  You don't even need to tell her it's because of bad sex if you don't want.  Just say you don't feel the chemistry is there.   It's very early in the relationship.  She should get over it pretty quickly.  
"Dude relationships shouldn't be this hard. Why are you wasting your time?

And don't say ""because I love her"" because honestly, feeling love towards someone, and it being one of the only ""positive"" things, is not a reason to continue a relationship. Both parties need to try."

"I would spend less time with them and focus on fostering other friendships. Your husband is right in that you're getting pushed in with the wives bc it's easier to say ""this is a boy's night"" than it is to invite you. You're right in that its a shitty way to treat a friend and it hurts your feelings. Thing is, trying to force your way in will push them farther away and/or rock the boat. Plus you deserve friends that want to hang out with you! Focus on other friendships and give yourself some time and space and you'll be less hurt/angry about the situation. "

"You grew $5 to $13 million in 8 years? Damn you're a good investor.

I'd tell your mom that your money is tied into long-term investments and you can't take it out even if you wanted to. Tell her you plan to make first withdrawal only in 30 years and anything sooner will be at significant loss."
"I wouldn't add the ""you know how to reach me"" part. It implies that he's still hanging on to hope, which he shouldn't be, and it also sets him up to be disappointed if she doesn't reach out to him again.

Everything else is perfect."
"I'm old enough to be your mother, even your grandmother if a couple of teenage pregnancies happened.

"You absolutely did the right thing. You're not stalling for the sake of stalling--you have a valid reason. Your counter-ultimatum is not unfair or out of line. It's very reasonable.

Stand your ground and let her know the only way it will happen is if she steps up like you have asked."

Just some things to think about..."
"Sounds like she's not worth being around, and you'll be better off without her as a friend. Yes, I think you're handling this quite fairly."
"&gt; I feel it's incredibly important to discuss your long term life plans with someone you're in a relationship with so that you don't end up spending 10 years with someone who actually wants different things.

Yes true. Then like any reasonable, intelligent person you talked to your partner of two whole years. 

&gt; He took this to mean that the relationship is ""worthless unless you get a baby out of it""

That's an awful and immature conclusion

&gt; He said that most guys would run away from me. That I'm neurotic and still a ""girl"" and much too young to be thinking about these things

That's an ugly thing to say. 

&gt;  he said I was so selfish and manipulative crying to end the conversation

That's also an ugly thing to say. 

Hint there's someone being manipulative and selfish here but it's not you. You are just reacting to his ugly words. 

&gt; How do I voice my opinions to him when he seems to think I'm neurotic and weird?

You already have. 

He doesn't see you that way so he wants to hurt you badly enough that you'll never mention it again.

That's his goal here. And he's achieved it. You are not going to mention this stuff again and he's hoping you'll put your life an dreams on hold to hang out with him, while knowing he doesn't even want to talk about where you guys are heading as a couple because of unlikely and undeserving hypotheticals like

&gt; I could turn out to be a bitch in 2 years  

After 2 years together, you deserve better. You know this relationship isn't going to end up anywhere near where you'd like it to go. It's time to do what you said you would do - decide what to do with the information he's given you. 

&gt; so that you don't end up spending 10 years with someone who actually wants different things

There's been a few ladies posting about how their partners strung them along for years/ decades. None of those partners ever honestly told them ""no marriage and kids is not on the table"". 

They just manipulated their partners - acted wishy washy enough, pretended their partners were selfish to want what they wanted, argued ad infinitum why it's just the right time and if only they could be a little patient. 

One lady posted about how her relationship was ending anyway because in her forties all she felt was bitterness and resentment at her dreams of a kid and marriage being put on hold for so long. "
"First of all, there is no set rule book for how men are supposed to be. Don't feel ashamed or weird because you love your baby so much. :)"
"I wouldn't say anything. Continue working, save money and once you're 18, say you're moving out and you're paying everything on your own and you're done with them. It's the best thing you can do."

"If she doesn't get her shit together, she'll have both. "
"You can't change her. You're an adult seeking the company of another adult and she is barely out of her teens and expecting to be babied. Even if you managed to work through the fact that you're actually dating her parents, do not marry her before you live with her. Do not buy a house with her. She has no sense of personal responsibility, she won't clean or care for the property, and she won't run any errands because it's ""too dangerous"". "
"If your dad is having new mood swings and saying things that are out of character for him, it may be signs of dementia.  Sounds just like what my dad went through in his mid 70s."
"What a piece of work. I know he was awful to you but I'm going to focus on his affair partner for a second:

 He lied to her about your existence and continued this lie even when he knew she was about to encounter you in a public setting. What the fuck?! So he was willing to risk her being shocked enough to break down and tell you in public in front of all of his colleagues. He also chose to start an affair with a person in their early twenties, probably straight out of college and in their first professional role. That rings a bit manipulative for me. 

He lied to you and continued this lie even with the threat of her planning on telling you, and then even after you knew. He risked your health rather than talk to you.

He had no intention of telling you OP. He's good at lying and didn't come clean until you were banging him over the head with the truth. He's only sad now because his actions are affecting him rather than other people."
"You have a ride-or-die stepmom right there, OP. Buy that woman ALL the drinks. "
"Lacy is being completely unrealistic.  Does she expect this guy to magically cook up some bulk chicken breasts from Costco so she saves thousands of dollars and her food is cooked by Famous Chef?  A chef's reputation lives and dies on the quality (taste, presentation, etc...) of their meals.  Even if the chef cooks for free, he would likely need a professional kitchen (fully stocked), 2-3 kitchen staff, 4-5 wait staff, plates and utensils, high-quality food, etc..  None of those things is free or cheap.  A catering company would almost certainly be cheaper, in this instance, because they have the staff and materials already on-hand.

Also, the chef would miss the wedding due to preparing the meals.  So, he could not attend the wedding and work his butt off for someone for free or not attend the wedding and get paid (if working that day) or have a relaxing day off.  Which would you choose?

Carly is right to not even ask him.  That said, you should either take a stand (""I'm not going to try to convince Carly because I think she's right."" or stay out of it altogether."
Comedy option: Tell him you're pregnant and you're keeping the baby but he's free to sever his parental rights. You'll never see him again.
"Fine?  Nah this kid is hitting a home run, and I think the bases are loaded."
"I have asked this question MANY times in my 16-year relationship. My husband has basically 2 modes: happy and engaged or disengaged and standoffish. As a result, when he's being standoffish, I can never quite tell whether he's tired, anxious, stressed, angry at something I did, angry at something he thinks I should have done, angry at something going on with work, angry at something going on with himself... you can see how that's a problem, because in about half these situations there's something he needs me/likes me to do about it and in the others he just needs to recharge and isn't actively pushing me away. And even if there's nothing he needs me to do, it's a tall order to have to accept just being ignored until he feels like no longer ignoring me. 

Of course, he never much liked the question either. ;) 

What helps is for you (personally) to understand that her asking the question usually doesn't mean there's anything wrong with your relationship. It just means she's feeling disconnected and wants to feel closer. (So that's actually a sign that there's a lot that's right about your relationship - you don't miss people if you want them to go away.) 'Is anything wrong?' is a relatively diplomatic icebreaker to indicate she's noticed something off about your interactions today - it gives you the opportunity to say 'yes, actually' and discuss that without requiring her to get into such a vulnerable position that 'yes, actually' could cause a problem. 

What also helps is for you (together) to come up with things you can do that reassure her that things are OK and don't demand more from you than you can give right now. And that's not at all about having to act over the top happy (because if she's sensitive enough to pick up when you're disengaging a little, she'll DEFINITELY be sensitive enough to pick up when you're lying through your teeth about how you feel, and there's nothing quite like that to make you worry that there's something wrong). 

Some ideas that usually work for me: give me some clarity into what's going on ('man, such a busy day at work, having days off is great but then you get back and there's a ton of stuff waiting for you!'), try to stay emotionally engaged with the conversation as much as you can (even a 10-minute convo that's engaged and responsive is better than half an hour of monotone, one-syllable answers where you can just feel the other person would rather drive rusty nails into his thighs than to talk to you, EVEN if that exhaustion isn't due to anything to do with you), ask for something she can do for you (not 'leave me alone' but 'give me a hug/bring me a beer/think of something fun to do together the next time we meet'), ask for a rain check ('dead on my feet tonight, gotta go - hey, wanna do something extra fun on Saturday?' - planning for next week means you want there to be a next week!), all kinds of low-attention physical contact (watch a movie with your head in her lap, afternoon cuddle-nap, walking hand in hand), express the wish you could be more engaged right now ('oof, I'm too tired to talk but I wish I could just hug you right now - looking forward to X day'), promise normal levels of attentiveness next time ('can barely stay awake right now but I want to hear all about X thing you did today - tell me tomorrow? I'll call you'), stuff like that. Make up a list that works for the both of you. Slightly more difficult: engage with her feelings. 'No, nothing's wrong - what makes you ask that? Am I acting differently? Are you feeling lonely?' Sometimes just being able to say what you'd like is enough, even if you know you can't have it. (Saying 'I've had a rough day too and was looking forward to talking to you all day, and I'm sad you're too tired to enjoy it much' is better than thinking 'I wish I could tell you what's bothering me but I know you'd just go off on me if I did that'.) The reason she's asking 'Is there anything wrong?' is probably because she's afraid to say 'I noticed you're not smiling at me, not responding to my jokes as much, generally acting like you don't want me around, and I want to find a way to feel close to you again.' 
"
"None of this

&gt;We were never able to talk about problems. We'd have an argument and he'd bring up all the issues he has, but would be unwilling to talk about them outside of an argument. He would ask me back handed questions and get mad if I didn't answer how he wanted, then tell me I was being sketchy. My actions were questioned to the point of me not wanted to tell him what I was doing.

Suggests that this

&gt;He accepted me fully

Is even remotely true.   

Congrats on breaking up with him.  Give yourself some time and space to move on."
"Please take into account the fact that she's sacrificed her career path, job opportunities and personal development to take full-time care of your child. 

Clearly she's very interested in this job since it's been something she's looked into before.

If you have your schedule a year in advance then this is completely doable. 

Yes, convenience, money and logistics are very important here. But so is self actualization. 

You've been freely allowed to pursue and direct your career path while she stayed home raising your kid. 

She should have similar consideration. You see some convenient logic in her taking a job you'd prefer her to have but there's more to life than that. 

Resentment feasts off of moments like these."
I'd probably tell my best friend of 20+ years that the person they are married to had confessed their love for me
"Problem is at her age its very ingrained.  Maybe sit down with her over a glass of wine and ask her how she's doing.  Get serious with her.    Ask her how her self esteem is doing.  Say you've noticed she makes a lot of comments about how pretty she is and worry she's suffering inside.  Her answer will tell you how to proceed.
"
"His reaction was despicable. 

However, I would focus on that over the comparison between you and his ex. It's possible he learned a lesson from that; that elaborate proposals and fancy expensive rings do NOT a strong relationship make. Perhaps she pressured him into those things and he's relieved to be with someone who understands that the sentiment is more important than the symbol. 

But, dang, I would be pretty upset at his reaction. And to fix it by promising to buy whatever you want? He's not addressing the real issue here. "
"You have a few options. One is that you be paid upfront for your work. Another is that you insist that she pay you electronically before you leave. 

Also, if you're taking a train in to do this, have her pay for the ticket. Travel stipends are a thing.

Her excuses are bullshit and you know that. Put your foot down. 

"
"One thing I don't see anywhere in your post: does your sister (i.e. the bride) actually want her to give a speech? From the way you wrote it, it sounds like the bridesmaid has made this decision for herself. 

Honestly, I don't think the line in question is a huge deal, but then I don't know your sister and the kinds of things that would bother her. But definitely encourage the bridesmaid (assuming the bride wants her to give a speech at all) to write it beforehand. Winging a speech is almost a surefire way to blow it and look like an idiot. "
"yeah... she blatantly endangered the household pets after being explicitly told to leave them alone. 

you shouldn't have to put up with a friend who has zero respect for your (very reasonable) boundaries. 

honestly, facing a real consequence is the only way she might ever grow out of this. you are actually being a good friend to her by showing her this reality. forgiving it and enabling her behavior just increases the chance that she'll cause a more serious problem with more serious consequences. 

you are absolutely handling it fairly.

"Life is short for everyone, but for you that has a lot more gravity to it. You know first-hand how short it can get, how important it is to make the most of your time.

You haven't seen Rachel in a while, so nobody can say if you'd hit it off or if anything is still there.

But putting the Rachel issue aside for the moment - 3-4 *years* of strife with your partner is a serious problem. You don't have that time to waste being unhappy; frankly, nobody does.

If it was me, I'd be thinking long and hard about how much of my precious life I'd want to spend with someone I wasn't 100% over-the-moon, head-over-heels crazy about."

"I know some people have done this before when their SO starts getting into gaming or a new hobby that takes up a lot of their time.

Talk to him and ask him how much time he spends on 1) work 2) you 3) his workout - he probably thinks he spends reasonable time with you and ""not that much time"" at the gym.

Then get him to track the time he spends on each for one full week. (You should do the same so you can be sure he's not cheating the numbers).

Seeing the real-life data might be a kick up the ass for him, but it might not be. If that's the case then another serious discussion needs to be had.

And certainly point out that raising a child will be 50/50 effort between you and until he can show you that he's both willing and able to commit that much time and effort, you do not want to bring a child into the world with him.

Good luck, OP!"
"I couldn't help notice this:

&gt;She is so pretty and thin. She is also very involved in charity work and a kind person to everyone. She also has a high IQ and is smart.

&gt;She was in a bikini and still looks pretty and thin

&gt; I am not as good looking or as smart as her and she is one of those people who does all this charity stuff and everyone loves.

You keep circling back to this, that she's better looking than you, smarter than you, better than you with social situations. You specifically referenced her weight twice.

What's up with that?

"Treating your children differently for no reason other than your wife feels it's ""her turn"" to create policy is going to be *worse* that just being harsh.  Because not only is your daughter going to rebel as hard as she can, she's going to point to the different standards you two set for her and her brother and how insane that is.

Your daughter should have the same rules her brother had until she does something that necessitates the rules changing.  That's the bottom line.

You should take one extra step, though, and get your daughter birth control.  Take her to a gyno or planned parenthood and let her talk with them about different types (I recommend an IUD for her, but it'll be her preference).  "

"I've been in a relationship with a bodybuilder of 14 years for some time now, and have since gotten into it myself. 

Initially, when I got into the relationship I was a little concerned of what it would mean for us, how we would spend time together, how often he would be working out, food differences, etc. 

He's very far past the initial ""over doing it"" phase that inevitably affects all bodybuilders who are not correctly coached and are just doing it on their own (reading forums, these are mostly bro bullshit), they tend to get a little over their heads and become obsessed with the muscle growth and how it feels. 

He works out 5-6 days per week, 45 minutes - 90 minutes tops, depending on if it's weights or cardio that day. 
His diet is strict at certain points during the year but he still has a cheat meal once per week, and we plan that so we both have it at the same time. 
When we travel together for a week or more he will plan it so that he is not on a restricted diet during it and can eat with me, if it's just a weekend away he will likely bring his food with him. 

This is who he is, he enjoys it, it is important to him and his physique is my ""type"". I support him and help him where I can. 
Researching/Learning about it at the beginning was to show my support and eventually that lead to me getting involved. I was already in the fitness industry so that wasn't difficult for me. He doesn't have smelly farts and he tastes normal, he knows what works for him because he was coached early and has since figured out what doesn't work. He doesn't compete, it's just his lifestyle. His libido has been affected at times but not enough to be an issue. 
I know this isn't the same as your situation as you didn't expect this change, but I am telling you this to illustrate what being in a relationship with someone who is willing to work with you while enjoying this chosen lifestyle is like. And he has to be willing to work with you. 

Saying all of this, bodybuilding is an extremely selfish sport. It isn't necessary for overall health and in fact can cause health issues. It is simply for the look. The competition/elite level is aesthetics not function or strength. So he isn't doing it for health or for you, this is for him and how happy he feels when he looks in the mirror, he needs to admit this to himself and then to you. 
It is selfish, this isn't necessarily a bad thing but it is the reality of it. 

Your husband is 34, weight training for hours everyday is dangerous and not sustainable. He is lucky in that he has been active throughout his life so his body wouldn't be in complete shock but it is a different sport with different things to consider. Training that amount is not necessary to meet goals at any age, and would actually halt progress. He is at real risk of hurting himself with what he is doing, either that or just wasting his own time and yours. 

So he needs to find a great coach that can help him figure out his training/nutrition. He can build a good amount of muscle in much less time, so he is either hurting himself with over training or being a lazy bum in the gym taking forever to get through his workout and likely bugging the regulars there with how long he takes. I do not know any bodybuilders that work out that much. 

When he says this is for you, be clear, don't beat around the bush or be afraid to hurt his feelings. 
If he wants to be in the bodybuilding world he will need to learn how to accept and value criticism. 

Tell him this isn't what you want and never have. That you enjoyed his body how he was and while you love him anyway this is for him and him alone and that he is affecting your marriage in the process. And that if he wants to continue with this while remaining married he needs to consult professionals and not ""bros"" and decrease how long he spends in the gym everyday. 
I do not subscribe to the belief that smelly farts is a normal thing for bodybuilders or simply due to too much protein. Something is wrong, his body is telling him that and he needs learn how to pick up on these cues and to adjust his nutrition and supplements until it is not a problem anymore. 

If you're willing to accept this new part of him and get involved, maybe you can research coaches in your area that can help him and gift him some sessions with the coach. Make sure he tells the coach how often he currently works out and everything about his diet. 
What he is currently doing is not sustainable for his body or your marriage and he needs help if he wants to continue with both. 

(Edit: long ass comment, apologies!)"
"This woman is literally telling you that she's not interested in being a financially responsible &amp; equal partner. She is basically unable to maintain this behavior now, &amp; when she does, it is only because she thinks you'll propose (not because she thinks these are important values in a relationship). She is explicitly telling you these things. So if you think for a second that she is going to become a dependable, financially responsible partner when you're married &amp; she has no ""incentive"", when she can't even keep up the facade now to get the engagement ring she desperately wants, then you're fooling yourself. 

So in my opinion, this is not fixable. She does not share your views on what she should contribute to your relationship (&amp; can't  even convincingly fake it in order to obtain something she truly wants... even a child can pretend to behave when presents are dangled in front of them). You're so lucky that she flat out told you this before you're married. It's no easy thing to break off a relationship like this, but it is far easier than spending the rest of your life with a spouse that sees no reason to pull her own weight. "
"&gt;Starting in a week I plan on cutting him out and getting a job to pay my own way. 

Switch these. 

Make distance until you get a job, make sure the job is secure and you have built up an emergency fund. Stop by r/personalfinance for more information and make sure you are truly financially solid before taking this action, given you are in no immediate physical or mental danger. 

Then, fade or formally cut out as you see fit at that time.

Having done it myself and to help you avoid my mistakes, I would suggest going low contact first, and getting into therapy to work through the emotional implications and emotionally sever the relationship on your end. Get your emotional ducks in order and then decide whether it is necessary or even desireable to go full no contact/formally disown.

Cutting someone out is best done to protect yourself from extreme or immediate physical or emotional harm, but it is ultimately a nuclear option that is not proportionate to most circumstances and can work against your best interest. 

Having a social safety net is very important, and at 22, you probably don't have enough people in place to fully replace the obligatory support that parents (even shitty ones) often offer. One bad job loss or break up can leave you broke and homeless. Again, good to make sure you have your ducks in order first. You can be true to yourself without shooting yourself in the foot. "
You need therapy. You've built up a fictional version of this guy in your head that no real man can compare to.
"I am going to skip over the relationship future and get into your business future.

FWIW, 13 years ago I opened my first business. 3 years later I closed it and opened another. Which is profitable and keeps a couple of us gainfully employed. In all that time I have been very active in local networking groups, my business does a lot of collaborative work with other businesses, I am in trade groups etc. And, as a web developer, I 'see' the inside workings of my clients' businesses. I need to understand them to represent them, right?

So.., what have I seen that upsets me? Well, I have seen a lot of girlfriends working nights and weekend to help out in their boyfriends businesses. For free. Then when the relationship ends, often the girl gets nothing.

If you were married, and fixing to leave this guy, we would all tell you to get a lawyer. As a non married person, who owns businesses with this guy ... The advice is the same. If you decide to leave, take that decision quietly. Take the time you need to back up all the financial statements and take a snapshot of what money is in what account. Take photo copies of any articles of incorporation. Take your information to a business attorney and have them ready to fight for you, just like a divorce attorney would."
I'm out. I really believe you should dump his ass. He's a lead weight around your ankles.
"You should not lose weight. You'd be underweight if you did. 

Also, he's pretty fucking entitled/selfish if he thinks the state of YOUR body is an indicator of your feelings for HIM.

"Hey other commenters, 
This post ISN'T REALLY ABOUT THAT HE FINISHED TOO EARLY. that's gonna happen in all relationships. 

It's that she feels USED. He got off and she got NOTHING and she had to go take care of the baby AND he joked that she was a prostitute. She rightfully feels upset about it. He ignored her and rolled over to go to sleep. He did use her. No one wants to feel used. "
"FWIW, this reads like he was trying to sexually assault you and only stopped when you yelled and your mom ran in. What's going to happen next time when you're alone and there is no one stop him? 

I don't think you should feel bad. I think you remove this horrible man from your life before he rapes you. "
"NOPE. NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE.

&gt;She's pretty much giving me the ultimatum right now, saying if I don't help her I'm no friend to her, which is really hard to deal with. 

I guess you're not friends anymore. Give her the number to a shelter and wish her well."
Your SM is a god. Can she adopt me?
"First, you didn't take a day off of work. You were not scheduled to work and were not able to pick up an additional shift when asked.  There is absolutely no problem with that.   

&gt;Well I told this to my parents,

Now you know that this needs to stop.   If you choose not to pick up an optional shift then don't ever tell your parents you had the option to work.  They need to be on an information diet so they can't hold this kind of stuff against you.  "
"This is going to be a shoot the messenger-situation. But do explain that you think the husband was drunk and how inappropriate he became. He's put you in a very uncomfortable and difficult position. 

There's going to be fall out and it's going to be ugly, so do organize some back up for you. People you can rely on and who support you who you can go to if ugly gets painful, because your friend will not be able to do that (immediately) for you. "
"Well, this is easy. Just go. Your parents will hate you for now, but will either get over it, or are better off outside of your life. Just because you are the result of their sperm and egg meeting doesn't mean you should throw away your whole life because they think being successful is uncool.

Deep down your parents are probably pretty hurt and ashamed they couldn't give you a better life. Their reaction right now is extremely defensive. Shame often manifests itself as anger. Before it was at Katie, because she was the successful one. That's what you are getting right now. The problem is, if your parents never realize this and don't want to work through it, they aren't going to, and it's not your job to get them there. They are the parents and should be showing *you* how to live a good life."
"I'm pretty skeptical that she will actually leave.  I'm also skeptical that she wants to work again.  

To me, a year of unemployment and also intense pressure to get engaged/married asap reads like she wants to keep her house wife lifestyle and just shift it to wedding planning then kid planning then kid having with no actual working for paychecks included in her future."
"Jeez. You're taking your *sister* on a trip for her birthday. Your GF is being ridiculous - you did exactly what she said she wanted, and now she's upset. That's ridiculous.

I would seriously rethink this relationship. "
"I was you. I recognize that anger so much, holy shit. All my ex's promises to change came after me already having left, and it pissed me off to no end. Its not like I didnt voice my concerns before that, it just always fell to deaf ears, because it was **easier for him to knowingly let me stay unhappy than it was for him to even try make adjustments**. And he didn't promise to change until it affected his happiness too, via me leaving.

That was just, in the end, unforgivable to me. Even if it all changed from then on, which he tried to show me, it was just way too much resentment and hurt to mend. I do not want to be spending the rest of my life catering to someone who was so okay with the idea of me being uncomfortable and unhappy due to his lack of care. Do you? "
"1. You are not in charge of her work schedule.
2. If she's allowed a weekend day off, she can take it. It's none of your business if it's for a party, for church, to feed the poor, or to join a skydiving club. It's an allowance that the company affords her and one that you can take advantage of as well. It's fair by definition.
3. If she invites you to parties, you're not obligated to go.
4. If she doesn't come in when she's scheduled to, you should hold her to account by making sure your Team Leader knows. You don't need to afford her slack.
5. Find something else to occupy your mind. Nothing is wrong here."

"There's a common problem with former abuse victims where they tend to settle, because they set the bar much lower. ""Doesn't hurt me"" is most people's absolute bare minimum in a relationship, but for someone who's been abused it might seem like an accomplishment or a point in their favor. 

OP, these are not the actions of someone who cares about you. This is barely a step up from your abuse. You deserve so much better. You can set the bar about a mile higher than this douchenozzle who doesn't think your literal torture was a big deal. "
"&gt;  Come on, you can't drop that kind of bait without giving us more details!

I guess she had found stepdad after seeing SM and demanded that he take her shopping right NOW! But stepdad was like, ""the ceremony is going to start, we aren't leaving now.""  She stormed off and found a friend who she tried to trade dresses with.  But the friend thought she was being silly and said it was really cute how ""Both of OP's mom's are wearing matching outfits.""  My SM found out she was crying in the bathroom, so she went in there with one of my bridesmaids and said loudly enough for my mom to hear, ""I wish I had worn a different dress.  It's so similar to OP's mom and everyone keeps telling me how much better she looks in it than I do.  She really does wear it better.""   I guess that was enough to calm my mom down because she came out of the bathroom and was smiling and showing off her dress after that.

"Tell her you and Carly are so much alike that both think she is crazy. 

The difference between your birthday and her wedding is that your family got together to celebrate you and you are grateful that carly's boyfriend cooked for you as a gift or a favor. 

A wedding is a party she is throwing to her guests so she can share her happy day with them. So yeah it might be her day but she has to realize that she is the one with the obligations that day and people can help her if they want to. So if she keeps with all this ""he must do what I want"" you might not even want to assist to her party let alone help her with it. 

So tell her that she is the host of her wedding not the main guest and to act accordingly."

"You know that hipster stereotype -- ""I liked that band before they were big"", ""This restaurant was better when no one knew about it"", etc. -- that's your girlfriend.  She's a contrarian.  She's built an identity around the fact that she's anti-anything that is remotely pro.  

You approach it by telling her that you're keen on having those experiences with HER, not just having them.  Emphasize that it's not just that a new restaurant is open, but that hte both of you can go see what the fuss is all about.  Creating new stories is part of maintaining a relationship.  If she still says no, she's either being stubborn to prove a point or really just doesn't like people."
"That's what gets me - when they sense you're about to leave and they do a total transformation, all it proves is that they *knew* what it would take to make you feel loved. They just didn't fucking care! In a healthy relationship, he would've listened to her concerns and even if he'd been genuinely clueless he would've been responding to her attempts at communication, or showing in his own ways that he truly cares. This isn't one of those times where love languages are just incompatible or they just need to get on the same page, etc. 

OP, your husband knew what it took to make you happy and simply deemed it too much of a hassle. He's behaving this way purely because he wants the security of the marriage back. As SOON as he's feeling secure again, everything will return to normal. Some people really are that selfish, and there's honestly nothing that you can do,  to change that. The fact you had reservations prior to the marriage is indicative of this. He's *never* really pulled his weight as a partner. Even so, you gave him a shot. Look, you've tried your best, and that's commendable. But it's a lost cause. Don't let him back in. I've been in relationships like this and I'm telling you, as soon as you let him move back in, as soon as he senses you're softening, he'll start getting complacent again, and somehow it'll be your fault for being too harsh or high maintenance. Don't you think you've put in enough time? If he truly cared about a mutually satisfying marriage he would have pulled his weight by now. All he's proved is that he *could*, but doesn't want to. That callousness in itself should be a deal breaker. How loving can your relationship be if he has the capacity to make you happy, and he holds out on it until it serves him to try and charm you? 

Your gut reaction of anger is correct. It's telling you that this is bullshit. And it is. I know it's hell to leave someone you've been so profoundly invested in, but imagine living the rest of your life with someone who's happy half assing your relationship. There really are people out there who take intimacy seriously. Shit, the truth is even being alone is healthier than being strung along by someone who never intends to ever actually put you first. You deserve better."

"&gt;  I really don't want to be one of those wives who's controlling of her husband's guy time or who he's friends with

Why are you concerned about his friends? Why are you still calling him your husband? Why are you not flipping your shit over an almost-forty year old man doing pranks that most teens would consider too far?

How is sneaking piss into your drinks funny or a prank? Are you laughing? Do you see the humour in it? No, you're disgusted and humiliated and THAT'S what your husband and his friends are laughing at. That you were being abused by a person you trusted and you didn't even realise. 

These guys aren't a bad influence. Your husband is scum. No one told him to do this prank, he decided to do it all on his own. Your husband thinks this shit is *funny*. This is the kind of person he is. 

Do you really want to stay married to him? Do you want to stay in the same house as him? What else has he done? Jerked off into your face-cream? Farted onto your pillow? Pissed on your toothbrush? Rubbed his balls on your plate? How can you trust this man again when he thinks it's funny to humiliate you?"
"Yep, definitely don't go back there.  I'm assuming your mom may already know what type of people they are since she said she didn't like them.  But I would definitely tell her what happened especially considering how your father participated in the conversation and wasn't much help. If possible it would be good if you and mom could have a conversation with your father.

Besides not going back to that church, it's more of a case of discussing how your father is making such comments about you and your family (your sister and mom) to his friends.

"Sounds like your boyfriend hit his limit and set a boundary for his personal sanity. Good for him. He is a grown up, took his best shot at making this work for yyou , and extracted himself when your dad started throwing gasoline on the table. Sounds perfectly reasonable. 

You wanted boyfriend to walk on water so you can pretend your dad is not an asshole and perpetuate some Disney version of celebrations for your mom. You panicked when you realized boyfriend is not going to play along with you and mom's enabling. 

He's too healthy for you right now. You either need to grow a spine and set clear healthy expectations with Dad about acceptable  behavior or find a spineless boyfriend who is ok with enabling your family dynamic. 

Sorry to sound harsh but I have been in your boyfriend's shoes and he does not deserve to be shamed for making a mature healthy choice. "

 &gt; we have had an amazing marriage.

Again, I'm sorry, but no you don't."
"Here's the deal, unfortunately you can do nothing to make her like you more, and if your father isn't going to step in and tell her to knock it off there's absolutely nothing you can do encourage her to stop.

She might be one of the lame insecure second wives who feel threatened by being reminded that her husband had a life before her. And again there's nothing you can do about it.

Your only source of strength is to work with your father through this issue. By being absolutely pointed and factual giving him direct examples of her shenanigans.

Point out her misbehavior every single time it happens, and even if it's publicly or privately you stop what you're doing find your father and announce it to him at the bad behavior is continuing.  At some point he's going to have to either A force her to stop or B will tell you that he doesn't want to hear it anymore. Either way you'll have a resolution to this awful situation.

I want to point out that you are doing nothing wrong. You should expect love and compassion from your parents and stepparents, you are a family member that deserves 100% protection. The fact that this person is not mature enough, or adult enough, to give you the love and respect you deserve it's not your fault.

Stand tall and know that you are correctly feeling wronged, and should point it out to your father and every opportunity in order for him to protect you. After all that is his job.

Edit: a word"
"I understand how you bringing up the ex's ring was hurtful, but he handled this whole situation extremely poorly. By throwing your ring out the window I think he shows you that's how much he values your relationship. You are not the piece of shit, he is. He overreacted and did something that really hurt you on purpose.

He got with you 7 months after the divorce and barely puts effort into your relationship.. you sound like a rebound. Go to counseling before marriage if you want to go through with this. But if they doesn't work I think you guys sound bad for each other."

Instead, it seems you are viewing women as a means to and end - the end being what you think will make you happy. This leads you to seeing EVERYONE as a potential partner instead of determining if a woman is right for you based on her personality and values, which creates a vicious circle. 

The thing is, women pick up on this mindset. If you were a woman, would you want to be with someone who held your outlook on women and relationships? I would think not. 

Also, you're 22. Your late teens and early twenties can be awkward times for relationships. Don't go to the dark side - there are wonderful things that await you, you just need to shift away from focusing solely on the end goal. Hope that helps.

"No one has to bear the brunt of her abuse if she's not there.

Why should you or anyone HAVE to bear her abuse??"
"&gt;But ultimately, I don't think I could have sex with anyone I didn't know and like personally. So that means if we did pursue the bedroom-guest-star route, it would need to be someone familiar to us, most probably a friend of ours.

No, it doesn't need to be a friend, you can get to know and like new people right? 

You're approaching this from the wrong angle I think, if you want to sleep with someone else, it doesn't have to happen next week, you can treat it more like dating and put some effort into getting to know people you want to sleep with. 

If that sounds like too much work, yeah you probably want the best friend more than the experience. "
"Fuck 'em. You're allowed to be angry. You had a certain, totally fair expectation about your life with him, and that has died. You're grieving for your marriage and the life you had hoped and expected to have. That's even if you don't consider the deception, and the emotional labour he chickened out on with your kids. You lost your partner almost as utterly as if he had died and you have to build a new co-parenting relationship with him now, even though that is never what you had wanted, or believed would happen. It is devastating. 

Get some therapy for yourself. Your anger is legitimate, but you're going to have to find a way to co-parent with him and live in respect with your children. You need a safe place to express your sadness and anger and proceed thoughtfully. You're not wrong, but your intense emotions might be coming out in ways that aren't helping you or your goals. So, therapy. "
"If seeing a thin person is all it's going to take for her to kill herself, she has severe mental problems and needs professional help. You aren't responsible for her mental health, she is."
"Just be vague and say you got a good increase.  If they push it, I would just say a 20% increase to get them off your back.  "
"If she's really beautiful, it's likely all that people have ever noticed about her for her whole life. This has trained her to ""perform"" as a sex object because it's the only thing that gives her validation and boosts her self-esteem.

The funny thing about being pretty is, it's okay for everyone else to talk about it to you, but mentioning it yourself breaks a social taboo and makes you the target of ridicule. What a double bind, huh?

I mean, isn't that really fucked up? People are saying it to you all the time and you're supposed to pretend that you've never noticed.

Your friend sounds annoying and like she has very low self-esteem, possibly because the only thing the world has ever valued her for is superficial and fleeting. It's really weird to have people constantly making a fuss over something that is incidental and largely out of your control, and pretending that it's all that you are. It's a serious mind fuck.

Your reaction to her isn't helpful at all. She probably needs therapy to help her realize there's more to her than just her fortunate genes.

"OP, please be fully honest with him. You need to tell him about your appearance preferences too. Also tell him that he says he is doing this for you but you've never been into extremely muscular men sexually and he is actually trying to change in way that makes him less attractive to you. That you loved him as he was, and as he is now you are still attracted to him, but if he just goes for full bulk that isn't your thing. Better he know now before he tries to bulk further.

Be clear with him that he is already healthy, he is not doing this for you or his health, he is doing it for himself and that's okay but he spends so many hours on it and changes your lifestyle so much you feel you/your marriage are second place and neglected. Be clear that you miss him and you miss sex (and tell him his cum is less good). 

Also be clear with him that having a newborn is a lot of work and requires being home/available. That if he spends hours a day at the gym you will be sad and isolated at home with a needy baby by yourself and that is scary. Be clear that you want to have his baby, but he has to show you now first that he can be an available husband who is home most of the time. Otherwise he does not have the time to take care of a child. "
"&gt;he only did it because he missed being intimate and that I had been emotionally unavailable for a long period of time

This is when he should've come forward and talked to you about these issues. He waited to talk until he'd already cheated on you for months and you caught him red handed and forced him to confess. So it wasn't something he actually cared enough to discuss and try to solve, it was just something he used as an excuse to do this to you."
"This seems like the plot of a Lifetime movie in which the married man gives into temptation only to realize that the teenage girl is actually mentally unstable, has built a shrine of him in her home, and plans to run his wife off the road with her new provisional license so that she and said married man can ""finally be together"". 

Be firm and stern, and in no uncertain terms tell her, ""Stop it right now. Your behavior is inappropriate and I have absolutely no interest. You are embarrassing yourself and bothering me.""

I suggest during a calm time when he's not baby talking, tell him straight up ""The baby talk is really unattractive.  I do not like it.  I need you to quit it.""  If he protests, tell him ""Look, I'm just communicating with you that I don't like this thing you do.  I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.  I'm trying to be open with you.  I don't like it.""   The next time he does it, move seats on the train, saying ""I told you, I'm not feeling the baby talk.""  Kissy noises?  Grimace and say ""No, I won't be kissing you, because I'm grossed out by the way you phrased the request.   You know I don't like that.""

He is totally going to be butthurt over this because he's into this weird baby thing and he probably gets that you aren't but is trying to force the situation.  

ETA:  also the poop thing is just... why does he feel the need to tell you that?  Do you guys normally talk about shitting?  I get that all relationships are different but after 15 years of being with my SO, we still keep the door closed when we shit, and spray air freshener afterwards... we both *know* the other person is shitting but it's nice to at least ACT like there's a modicum of mystery left in the relationship.  We've been together long enough and seen each other in low points of shit or puke, but we just kindly act like that never happened and never mention it again.  It's just polite."

"Your story reminds me a bit of one of my siblings. He was so focused on his own addictions and mental health issues for a period that he there are big aspects of our family life that he just missed.

"/r/legaladvice might be able to offer some guidance to see if there is anything you can do legally.  Maybe if you can find out where she is, you can help her get emancipated or something.

"This guy is still abusing you. He's just doing it now through sarcasm and silent treatment. He fully expects that you will feel guilty enough to give him another chance - or at least, a chance for him to start lovebombing.

I understand feeling confused, lonely and scared right now, but honestly? *That's what he wants.* A person who genuinely loves you would NOT accuse you of being a lesbian (!) because you don't want to have sex with him when he's been abusing you. (Oh, right, you must've turned lesbian, because THAT'S the only reason a woman wouldn't throw herself onto THAT. /s)

Please check out loveisrespect.org if you haven't already, and if you're in the US, consider calling 311 to find resources in your area. Also, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE find yourself a therapist and a lawyer, not necessarily in that order, to help process your emotions and your separation.

Basically, there's a reason your husband went for someone 15 years younger than him. He thought he could get away with this. And yeah, there are always good times with an abuser. How would anyone ever end up with an abusive partner if there weren't? If he'd treated you at the outside the way he does now, you would have started running and never looked back.

He is still trying to manipulate you. Please DO NOT STAY WITH THIS MAN. He WILL escalate. And he definitely won't change."

"You're overthinking this. If you don't want to go on a date with the guy, just cancel it. He's basically a stranger and you don't owe him anything.

"So, I'm going to look at this from a slightly different angle. I think her imminent divorce indicates that her marriage has probably been bad for a while, which at least partially explains why her vain behavior has been getting worse recently. As you mentioned, your friend is feeling really insecure right now, and she is searching for validation.

&gt; She moved away to a different state with her husband a couple years back, but now they're in the midst of a divorce, and she came back home to clear her head and spend some time with friends.

It sounds like she is at a low point and she is looking to her family and friends for comfort and support right now. That being said, I don't think this is the most appropriate time to explicitly address her character flaws. Even if it's well-intentioned, it would likely tear her down and cause her to become defensive. I think you should use this as an opportunity to encourage her to focus on her less superficial qualities.

If she says something like

&gt; Yeah, I don't know if I'm ever going to find another boyfriend to be honest. I have this problem where everywhere I go someone is always telling me I'm the most beautiful girl they've ever seen and it's SO annoying . . .

then you could respond with something like ""I'm sure you'll find someone who will appreciate you for more than your looks. You're so x and you're very talented at x, and those qualities are much more important."" You're reminding her that looks aren't that important, redirecting the conversation, and helping build up her confidence in a healthy way. If you aren't rewarding her attention-seeking behavior by commenting on her appearance, then she'll probably stop making these kinds of comments. If it continues to be an issue in your friendship, maybe wait until she's in a little bit better place and address it more explicitly. "
"I really didn't think it would work! The funniest thing was them both ending up in almost identical dresses.  I guess my mom had a minor meltdown over it, but I didn't see it. "
"SAY NO. Please. You have nothing to feel guilty about and owe them nothing. It's their job to figure it out. Please don't let this jerk manipulate you, because that's what he's trying to do. Playing on your emotions and naivete to get what he wants and make things easier on him."
"Your self reflection is great. You've identified your goals, and you've also identified some things that might hold you back. You know what you don't want to become. This is all good. 

If you're finding it hard to tolerate being alone or negative feelings about yourself it can be really hard to escape the temptation to blame others. Places like r/incels are negative places because they're full of people giving in to anger and resentment and collectively validating each other while making their problems someone else's fault. It's a tempting thought - I deserve everything that everyone else has, and those people are preventing me from getting it. 

The reality is that life isn't about what you deserve. If you think about people who have a huge problem with entitlement (image someone rudely yelling at the waiter because his food wasn't good enough, his seat isn't comfortable enough, the service hasn't been polite enough, etc.) they genuinely believe that they're inherently deserving of everything they desire. But life isn't about that. Yes, you can work for what you want. But it's not on a list of rights that you're entitled to. 

Obviously you know that women aren't commodities. They're not something that is on that list of rights. You're not waiting for life to hand one to you. They're just people exactly the same way that you're a person.

The solution ""focus on yourself"" is misleading because it allows you to imagine that if you work on yourself enough you will become attractive and find a partner. A better way to look at it is this - ""work on tolerating negative feelings without blaming yourself or others"". Focus on being comfortably yourself, without anger at your circumstances. 

I'd recommend looking into mindfulness meditation. It's all about focussing on the present moment and learning to observe your own thoughts, accept them, describe them to yourself, but not react or act on them. It's been shown to help with all kinds of things psychologically and I think it would be really helpful in building up more of an internal reserve, and self reliance. It's a type of self improvement that isn't inherently motivated by making yourself attractive to a partner."

"&gt; But your wife IS crushing on him. And they're talking about their relationships. That's literally how every ""it just happened"" cheating with a coworker story starts.

Came here to say essentially this.  It normal (I think) to have close friends at work, I mean, it's where you spend a majority of your time. 

But, you also have to know where the boundaries are. Having the level of intimacy with someone else that you admit you're crushing on is a big huge red flag.

Next they are having dinner &amp; drinks. They are confiding to each other about how much their spouses just don't understand their awesome and flirty friendship. One too many drinks happen and...

"&gt;  She told me that it sucks, but it kind of comes with the territory working here.

Whelp, she's wrong and she's a *terrible* manager. Unless you are a pro fighter, there is no job where you should have to accept being physically assaulted. That's what happened: He assaulted you. 

I worked in service for years. Every decent manager I've ever had would have kicked that guy and his friends out. If they protested, the cops would be called. If the manger wasn't handy and as a fellow server I had seen a customer lay a hand on my 16 year old co-worker, I would have immediately taken the table and told them it was time to settle up. You don't touch the staff. Period. Frankly, the fact that your boss didn't have your back *is* scary. 

Hell, most strip clubs wouldn't have tolerated that behavior from a customer. 

Your reaction to this is legitimate. It is perfectly reasonable to be nervous about going to work where your boss tells you to just get over it when someone grabs at you. I'd honestly look for another job. Your manager is useless."

The rest of your post demonstrates that you don't have a good relationship and your parents do have money issues.

"&gt;they have become one of my friends.

But still probably not your husbands best friend?  

I would drop the thing with the best friend, no good will come of that path as far as I can see. Read up on open relationships some more and see what might be a good fit for the both of you. 

Typically though, starting an open relationship because you have a crush on someone, especially if that someone is your husbands best friend might not be the best way to get the ball rolling if it's something you're serious about."

That's a very very **bad** idea.

Experience some independence for yourself, by all means--and I mean that seriously. Don't make long-term commitments knowing you'll regret not having the chance to explore yourself. 


But also, don't make long-term commitments without checking to see if you're compatible first. Very good friends and lovers can make *very bad* roommates, and more than one relationship has soured after moving in. 

I'm not saying yours will, but I am saying that if it does happen you don't want to be married at that point. 

Experience some living on your own. Experience moving in together, even if it's a few years later. And then experience marriage.

You are responsible and it is your duty to protect the niece and TELL the appropriate authorities. If you don't, this will continue and he will abuse others.

"&gt;Sam never agreed that Rachel and I should have broken up. He and Rachel serve on the same board of directors, so they see each other a few times a year and talk regularly. He’s always kept me updated about Rachel and vice versa.

Well, I think this is the ""original sin"" here, if you'll pardon the expression. It sounds like Sam has long been fixated on this ""OP and Rachel"" fantasy. We all have opinions about our friends' SOs, but it's kind of hurtful to the current partner to actively campaign that your friend should go back to the ex. Years go by, the hurt/resentment builds up, and now Sam makes this one last ""OP and Rachel"" play. I don't mean to sound overly harsh on Sam here, we're all human and the guy's dying, but I think even the most saintly partners might have some trouble being in Carol's position. 

OP, I think your own feelings are the key to all of this. It's clear from your post that Rachel evokes very strong feelings in you. Possibly both Sam and Carol picked up on that -- which would make Sam even more certain you two were meant to be, and Carol feel even more threatened by Rachel.  On the other hand, I think you should be careful that this isn't a ""grass is greener"" situation, where Rachel is easy to idealize because she isn't living the day-to-day stress with you like Carol is.  

I'm sorry you're dealing with all of this. Grief and mortality bring out the most unpredictable things sometimes. As concerned as you are for others, try to take care of yourself too."
"My mum is like this. Anti-doctor, anti-vaccination, anti-anythingiswrongthatadoctorcanfix.

Best case scenario and most likely, there is absolutely nothing wrong that cannot be easily fixed. How cool would it be to just GET THE PROBLEM FIXED?! And if it isnt something small or easily fixed, how cool would it be to figure it out early and GET THE PROBLEM FIXED?! You are doing the right thing.

"You pitched it wrong.

Prenups are not one-sided demands, they are a negotiation. **Prenups are for the protection of both parties.** That's why each person gets a lawyer; not just you.

Frankly you are gonna have a very hard sell now. Because yes, bluntly, you did as much as state you didnt trust her not to rip you off if it all goes south

One way to sell a prenup idea is as 'insurance"". You hope never to crash your car, you drive carefully to avoid crashing your car, but you'd still be crazy not to take out insurance against crashing your car

This is TOTALLY testing the waters.  So far this guy hasn't crossed the line but I would consider this a ""yellow alert"" situation. Be on your guard and try not to give him any future openings for these kinds of comments. With some people you need to just subtly reinforce that you're a dead end, and then they get the picture and move on.

I would also give your husband a heads-up.  I would frame it as ""hey, maybe I'm totally misreading situations X, Y and Z, but just to be safe I think it's better if I keep a little distance from Bob."" That way your husband can (hopefully) have your back if you need to break off a conversation with Bob or don't want to be alone with him. "

"She's being a bit much. 

On the one hand, she's probably a little right: Chinese culture is ""high-context,"" meaning that communication carries a lot of hidden meanings and is heavily dependant on context - including the shared knowledge of the people communicating. Western cultures tend to be low-context, which is basically ""I mean what I say and I say what I mean"". I'm assuming you're American/British/Australian, so *some* of your issues may be coming from this culture clash.

Still, she's being unreasonable. Being in a cross-cultural relationship (if that's what this is) means learning to meet your partner halfway, compromising on differences, and teaching them how to navigate your native culture. She can't expect you to act like a Chinese boy because you're not. 

I anticipate that this relationship isn't going to work out: your communication styles are very far apart and her expectations are very different from the reality of what you're doing. You should sit down and talk with her about your expectations going forward. Try to get her to agree to be more direct -- at least while you are separated by such a long distance and thus deprived of a lot of context clues you'd normally have in a conversation (e.g. facial expressions, tone). If that doesn't work, consider that you might be better off ending the relationship."
"&gt;How can I talk to him about what happened and explain that I wasn't trying to be over-dramatic? 

No -- you *weren't* being over-dramatic at all. He disrespected your boundaries, and persisted after you told him to stop. There's nothing okay about that -- you did exactly what you should've done. 

You have nothing to apologize for, or explain. He needs to accept the fact that no means fucking no. He doesn't have the right to touch you against your will just because he's your boyfriend."
"&gt; She keeps telling me she'll make my life in College hell when I go there.

Get good grades, go to a different college. Or get her thrown out of college if she causes you problems.

tl;dr; if she pulls any shit, shut it down ruthlessly."
"I'm sorry, but I couldn't be with someone that neurotic and accusatory, and honestly...not very smart. Herpes doesn't magically appear as tiny friction burn dots after sex. I can understand being concerned, but his reaction was nuts. And the fact that it is continuing is nuts. 

This is not how a 31 year old should handle themselves. 

I'd get tested anyway, just because of how paranoid he is and his overreaction would make me question why he was freaking out that badly. But I'm pretty sure 6 weeks of neurotic, baseless accusations would have me out that door. "
"I wouldn't be bothered if you can help it. There's nothing you can do even though it's irritating.

The next time someone brings up that you're copying her, I'd laugh at the idea and tell them that you don't notice Ashley so you don't know how she dresses."
She dumped you but at the same time can't stand the thought that it doesn't kill you anymore. Do NOT get back together with this person.
"Hey OP, there's a really good blog by EmmaClit called 'Holidays' which is about how hard it is to have a baby - I wonder if it'd be relevant to your situation/might open your hubby's eyes to how you feel?"
Agreed. She has to uninvite all the children and loathe them equally!
"YOU have caused nothing. He was on a trajectory that was going to end badly regardless of anything you did or did not do.

You dont *need* to know. He is one fucked up guy, just be glad he's out of your life. 

Anyway, why would mom have your number? This is manipulation: it got you back once before, dont fall for it again

TLDR: not your fault, responsibility, or problem"
"That's seriously fucked up. He thinks he's better at running your life than you are. Besides, the idiot ""stole"" your car with a KEY that thieves won't have access to.

Consider dumping him. Definitely take back his key to your apartment, and make sure to get the spare key to your car. "
"You did nothing wrong. I don't know what's with your family, but this is ridiculous. 

I guess if it gets bought up, say ""It was hot last night. I had a lot of trouble falling asleep and I only was comfortable naked. I expected some privacy in my room. I did not expose myself, I was barged in on. I will not apologize when this only occurred because someone else chose to violate my privacy."" 

If anything, you're the victim here. "
"You're 25.... What makes you think you will be alone forever?

Can you imagine the rest of your life like this? I'm talking about the next 50 years?

You deserve better, you KNOW you do. Imagine if you had a friend in the same exact situation YOU'RE in, what would you recommend?"
"I don't see anything wrong with the idea you have, or at least, it does seem like some degree of indirectness like that will be required to get her to receive the touch-up.

With that said, I wouldn't necessarily be friends with a Kat myself, but it seems like if you both live in the alternative style and see your appearance choices as an expression of your identities, then there might be a mental case for you to make to yourself that, streaky-haired or not, you are capturing your actual friend on camera in those pictures.  Not the friend you had to argue or trick into looking nice for your wedding.  Maybe part of her identity is wrapped up in doing her own dye job, so you are kind of going off the dynamic you both have had in the past by fighting her choice.  It's just a thought to consider in case you need some rationale to be okay with her hair."
"""Listen... i dont dislike your friends. But they dislike me.

I dont know why. And i dont know how to fix it.

They ignore me, treat me like dirt. 

Its not pleasent to be arround them.

And for somereason, this do not seem to bother you.

I do not want to spend my 4th of july feeling ignored, we already had this talk, i cant ""give them time"" if they use the time to ignore me.

My friends treat you like this?

If so please tell me im going to call them right now and ask what is going on.""

Its a good start.

Hope you guys can work everything, and avoid this talk when the friends are present.

If nothing changes and you are supposed to give them more time.

You should give her some time, some more permanent time.

No one should be forced to deal with that, its not physically bad but it is soul-crushing and if she cant notice that you are feeling like that, or worse if she does notice but doesnt care, its not a good relationship..."
"Wait wait wait...so for years he has been letting you continue to take hormonal birth control, which can fuck up your body and be unpleasant, and the whole time he has had a vasectomy?!?!?!?!  I would be raging mad as well.

He doesn't trust you and he's a liar.  I would either leave, or get therapy."
"He came over stating he was dropping off a gift, but he had no gift??? Does he think you are a moron and a dupe to believe his crazy lie and creepy behavior?"
"&gt; 'Not everyone should be homeowners. Consider these extra costs and the potential of ending up in serious debt.""

I'd skip the first part, I think that could go over the wrong way. Maybe framing it more like:

""Look you're going to be spending X amount more on housing each month, I don't know if I could cut my budget by that much and still feel happy with the quality of my life"" 

I'd strongly advice them to 'practice' that for a bit before committing to buying. So putting that amount away each month. If they are happy living with less at least they'll have some more savings. If they really don't like it, it might get them to reconsider. "

Looking at your post history: no way are you two ready to get married! You're still teenagers and have had some pretty serious relationship issues already...assuming this is the same dude that was calling you a whore and a bitch a few months ago. 
"Just checking, you're *sure* she was talking about your sister and not, for example, an estranged daughter of her own, unrelated to you? "
"I think you are projecting the flaws of this marriage onto ""What could have been with your ex?"". The real dilemma lie in that your marriage is not good, and I suggest you seek help to sort that out.

And for the diarrhea I would suggest lots of fiber in your diet and lots of water to replace the lost fluids"
"Honestly, it's not just a hobby for you. The lying, sneaking, and laziness is the concern for her, not specifically the cartoon. By your own admission, you put your job at risk over this thing. You broke her trust repeatedly, and a year of not working on your flash cartoon is not enough to rebuild it. Especially since you want to do it again!

Listen. I can guarantee if you do pick this up again, you will destroy your relationship for good. You can see a therapist to help with the obsessive thoughts, which are unhealthy. You, like everyone, deserve a creative outlet to express yourself. It's going to have to be something other than this one, though, if you want to keep your marriage intact. "
"You've only invested six months with this guy. From what you described, he's sounds like an ass. He's not very nice to you nor does he seem interested in becoming a part of your life with your friends and family. I'd give him the boot, girl. "
"Few people would base their timing of marriage by when other people get married. 

You either want to get married, or not. You sound like a yes, he sounds like a no disguised as a 'not right now'. 

You're not compatible"
"Thank you, I hope the same for you. I specifically told my sister that I wasn't ready to talk to my mom so that may explain why she didn't reach out. My sister knows I don't want to talk about or to her now either and she seems to respect that. She is also angry with our parents. She has been texting them but she hasn't let them see her kids since we started talking. "
"You're kind of assuming the other couple would be into it as well. Odds are they won't, and even asking them could potentially ruin your relationship with them. Despite your attraction I would eliminate them as potential partners.

"
"It sounds like to me that your wife has some sort of terrible anxiety if you're saying she's often having outbursts. Growing up my mother would often start screaming if something upset her, usually because her anxiety would turn it over in her head over and over and over until it caused her to pretty much have a panic attack. When you wife is calmer (definitely not now) I would talk to your wife about possibly getting therapy or medicine for anxiety. Make sure to let her know that it's okay to have emotions but when they actively harm you/her then they might need to be reigned in some."
"I don't think you're crazy for feeling this way. You've learned something about your brother's behavior, and it's natural that you're reevaluating how you feel about him.

I think the path you've chosen, seeing him and being civil but not much more, is a reasonable one for now. You're not disrupting family events or causing conflict, you're just dialing back on the relationship privately. That seems fair to me, and I think you should feel free to defend that position to your family if they ask you about it (e.g., ""Yes, he is my brother, dad, but we're not as close as we used to be, that's all"")."
"With all due respect to your pain and grief, you have been all over the map in terms of your emotions and you've had a lot of unspoken expectations of other people. You haven't communicated what you need or want but have just hoped people would understand and behave accordingly. People who haven't suffered the kind of loss and struggled the way you have with infertility have no clue what you're going through and no idea of what you need. I'm just imagining from Bella's perspective, she hasn't known whether/when to include you in things, and you kind of dropped a bombshell on her right before her own baby was due. You yourself say that you were uncomfortable with her sewing baby stuff in front of you and thought that was inconsiderate, yet you also complain that she has cut you out and not shared pictures, etc. You stopped engaging with her on social media and now you're upset that she's not reaching out to you. At one point recently you couldn't handle seeing her pregnancy posts, now you're fantasizing about getting baby snuggles. It's natural for you to be conflicted about all this but you can't expect Bella to figure out how you're feeling at any given moment and approach you in just the way you want to be approached, especially while she's dealing with a huge change in her life. I don't think you're justified in your anger toward Bella. I think you're justified in your grief, and maybe it would help for you to get some counseling to work through all of these emotions. "
"OP - the point of those shitty remarks is to make you feel bad. I would turn it around on them. 

My family loves to tear each other down, and acting as though they've said something not shitty-and-actually-positive is my go-to. The nicer and more sincere you are, the more confused they get. It's awesome because it forces them to consider whether they actually said something nice, and because no one can accuse you of being a jerk. 

Unsupportive aunt: ""I never thought you would amount to anything."" 

Me: *sincerely* ""I know, and look how far I've gone. :D I owe it all to the support of my family.""

TLDR: For every ""Oh, wow, you must be a receptionist,"" I would politely respond with pride, ""No, I'm an [x]. I've been working there for [x] amount of time. It's my dream job!"" "
"From what your husband said, this sounds like the last straw in a long line of ridiculous behavior. 

If your mom is a germaphobe, then she should absent herself from situations in which she'd be forced to interact with sick people. She should have just stayed in the car. Spraying a kid like he's a misbehaving cat is rude and inappropriate. 

I'd say that perhaps your SIL may have overreacted, but I kind of side with her, as a mom with a sick kid. WTF was she doing?! It's not like he was spreading the plague on her. 

With regards to your mom, I'd address it as she's in charge of her own behavior. If she doesn't want to be around germs, she needs to make that decision ahead of time. With regards to your extended family: ""Mom knew nephew was sick; she came in anyway and sprayed him in the face like a recalcitrant cat. It was ridiculous, and I'm not defending it.""

In the future, you give all parties all the relevant information, and if they decide, against better judgement, to go ahead with a meeting, it's out of your hands, and you are not involved with the fallout. "
"&gt; He compares me to other girls and talks about how if he was with anyone else stuff like this wouldn't be an issue.

And obviously, he doesn't feel the same way."
"So, no, you haven't talked to your doctor about this.

Go to your gynecologist and explain exactly what is going on."
"&gt; something my dad and BF definitely don't agree on. Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy guy - BF laughs and says he is a crackpot, my dad presses him, BF shakes his head, my dad starts asking him if he understands the gov't, and this is where it escalates. My dad starts repeating himself when my BF ignores him, and is getting angry. My mom and I are basically pleading with both of them to stop, but my dad wouldn't stop talking and my BF wouldn't respond. Then, my BF says ""I think it's time to go"", and everything gets worse. My parents hadn't given me all of my gifts, we hadn't finished eating our entrees, and my dad is now pretty angry, asking my BF who he thinks he is, that kind of thing. BF still ignores him, so I get up and leave with him just to end the scene in the restaurant, but tell him I can't just leave my parents like that. He was angry. Told me to text him when I wanted a ride home and left.




So, your boyfriend just sat there silently while your father kept going off on him, insulted him and went nuts? 

But...your boyfriend is the one in the wrong here? I don't blame him at all for leaving. 

Edit: typo."
There are lots of women your age who would love to split the bill. Go find one.
"When a colleague complains to you about a relationship, shut that conversation down. It's way too friendly for a workplace, and 98.7% of the time, in my experience, it's a covert way of trying to get into your pants. Doubly so if there's a rumour that your boyfriend is controlling. These guys are trying to set up a narrative where both you and they are in bad relationships, so... why not hook up? 

Also, cool any friendship with guys who claim that you're a threat to their current partner. Unless their partner actually confirms that, what you're dealing with is a clumsy romantic compliment. 

Basically, there's nothing wrong with you. 5% of the guys at your work are creepy-- which is pretty normal, actually-- and it's not worth your time to befriend them. Be polite, but keep them at a distance. "
"He's been dating her for a year and she expects designer bags and a trip to Europe for her birthday?

I honestly thinks it's delusional. 

Crazy entitled. "
You could stand to lose about 160lbs. That 160lbs being your piece of trash boyfriend. 
"You can make a group (I call mine ""Squares"") on facebook and add the people you don't want to see your posts to the group. Then when you make a post, set the privacy from global to everyone except...Squares. 

However I think it's almost a blessing that OP is finding out who is racist and who is not. That way he knows how people really think."
"Wow. Your boyfriend sounds unreasonable and honestly, controlling and abusive. It doesn't sound like he takes ownership of his own actions and blames you for all of his money problems. I'd take this as a sign that you two are incompatible and that you should move on from this asshole. "
"Please, girl, do NOT think like that! He is a liar and a cheater and you think you did something wrong? You? Hello, he is a major asshole here, not you!

Dump his sorry ass, take your friend to Europe and have a lot of fun."
"Tell him to stop all contact or he leaves you no alternative except to contact the police.  While you may not have enough for a restraining order, he might listen to a police officer explaining that actions have consequences.  Granted he doesnt seem to have learned that life lesson despite years of opportunity...."
"  The more detail and the more drawn out it is, especially after they try to interject with their theories the better."
I get the feeling that your parents are a little hurt/jealous by your desire to spend time with your birth mom. They're projecting. Don't feel guilty.
"You're not over-reacting. A man who claims he ""can't resist temptation"" is exactly the sort of person you don't want at a party, around women who are presumably going to be varying levels of intoxicated."
"I'm really sorry you are going through this. 

When you are not used to standing up for yourself it can come as a shock. We all want approval and we are scared of losing it, even if it's ultimately for our own good. It's going to take time to get over the shock of having stood up for yourself as well as the break up. 

If it's any consolation I think you made the right decision. You can't be in a healthy relationship with someone who refuses to think of your needs. 

For now put the photos in a folder, or box if they are physical copies, where you don't have to look at them. 

Allow yourself to cry, it's normal. 

Make sure you eat something to give you some energy. "
"&gt;He then asked if I would have a problem with him hiring a fake girlfriend, just for appearances. He said it'd be strictly professional; just a business arrangement with someone else looking to strengthen their presence on social media.

This is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. "
"&gt;He was telling me the women that I am going with are ""damaged"" and t hey fall for ""guys like me"" because I trick them.

This might be why women don't want him. I'm a straight young woman in my early 20s and that kind of thinking makes me want to run as far away from that guy as possible. Does he even realize how awful those things he says are?"
"Seriously, you couldn't ask for a bigger red flag.  The entitlement here is mind-boggling. 

Get out now OP."
"Sounds like he's one of those people who buys into the idea that all the fun stops once marriage happens. Some people just have a ton of hang ups around marriage.

I've talked with a lot of people like this and there's not really a way to get them to change their minds... it's often ingrained in them from an early age that marriage = fun times over. That whole ball and chain stereotype. It's super annoying.

That being said, your husband should really put his foot down and tell the guy the comments need to stop. At this point he's just talking shit about his wife now. 

Maybe you could tell him directly that you consider him a friend also and that it really hurts your feelings when he suggests you don't want him around or want your husband around him because it's not true."
"OP, even though it feels like it now, the last 10 years haven't been wasted. You went to med school, did residency, worked at the hospital, established your career, got a job in a private practice and you learned, grew and developed a lot in those 10 years. They are anything but wasted. 
Also, think about this for a Second: **Your husbands affair partner showed you more respect and curtesy than your own husband did.** She also seems to feel more guilty than he does even though she didn't even know he was married while he willingly cheated on you with her. She also seems to feel much more sorry than your husband. She put herself in your shoes and told you while your husband continued to lie to you. If he had wanted to tell you, he would have done that. He didn't. Let that sink in. His affair partner treated you better than he did. "
"I feel like I've seen similar situations on this sub a few times: SO talks a big game about buying presents and spoiling their partner, and then never actually follows through on it. It's as if just talking about it is enough for them somehow.


There's a Louis CK (I think?) routine where he talks about flying first class on a plane and daydreaming about offering to swap seats with someone in a cheaper seat. He never actually makes the offer, but just thinking about it gives him the warm fuzzy glow of being a good person. Maybe Bob is doing something similar with gift giving?


Is there a reason you've never called him on it in 4 years of being together? If you're worried about hurting his feelings, remember he's hurt your feelings plenty of times by getting your hopes up and  then not following through."
"You're not doing anything wrong. There actually was a really interesting article this weekend in the NYT that found nearly half of women and men in America still think it's inappropriate for married/committed partners to have one on one interactions with members of the opposite sex. 

These three seem to fall in that category. I'd just ignore it, sorry but you'll never be able to appease everyone in your life. "
"You can't save a relationship if you're the only one in it that wants to save it. 

Sorry for your loss."
"""Not sure where we got our signals crossed, but we're not in a position to give away the car for free and we didn't mean to give that impression. We could get about $200 to junk it, but if you really want it we could sell it to you instead."" "
"""we didn't even kiss"". Wow.  Such bravery.  "
"After 3 stints in rehab after a relapse 3 years ago, I just divorced my husband this April.  He had been sober 10 years when he relapsed.  He was a former crack addict as well.  We nearly lost everything and I saw things I never wanted to see.  I know it's difficult.  I drew a hard line from the beginning.  I kicked him out immediately.  He slept in the garage while I tried to keep things normal for my kids.   I liked to imagine I knew exactly what I would do in this situation, but the reality is that it's devastating and hard to know what to do.   And  no one really understood.  I was heartbroken and angry and embarrassed all at the same time. I'm sorry you're the middle of it now.  "
"&gt;How could you do that to someone you're supposed to love? 

This is the main issue here. OP, your husband knows you don't like these gross/disgusting/vile pranks, but he continues to do them anyway because he enjoys to upset/humiliate/harm you. That's not what someone who loves you should ever do. Beyond the urine thing (which is completely deranged and atrocious behavior), your husband clearly does not respect you. 

I think that you place a lot of blame on his friends for his behavior, and while his friends can have a negative influence on how he acts, ultimately he is responsible for the behavior in which he conducts himself. He's acting like a child. And I think that's offensive to kids because even kids know that someone ingesting your own body fluids if horrific. What if you were to get sick and get an infection? How would he feel drinking your urine? He has no empathy and it seems clear that he doesn't care about the consequences of his behavior on you. These pranks are going to lead to (if they haven't already) fear and distrust in your relationship because you can't ever be sure he's not going to be fucking with you. 

I'd suggest couple's counseling, but I honestly am not sure as you say this behavior has been ongoing for years. If there are no clear consequences to his behavior and he keeps continuing to associate with these friends, there's really not any counseling that can help (a counselor would more than likely tell him he has to limit/go no contact with this group of people since they appear to approve of and heavily influence how he acts). If he's willing to cut them out and work on your marriage, then counseling would be something you two should definitely do (and honestly, individual counseling for him because what in the fuck??). But to be completely honest, I would have left this guy. No sense in being tied to a child. "
You've always been her favourite punching bag. How would you feel if she prefers your child for that role? I think it would be difficult for Aurora to watch you turning a blind eye to treating your child the way you were treated.
The moment when a pathological people pleaser is finally put into a situation where they must take sides...  
"Not that I dont agree...but can someone actually come up with an acceptable, believable story as to why someone would say ""not coming home, cant tell you why"" to their spouse?"
"&gt; her previous boyfriends ""prioritized her more"" 

Well that *obviously* worked out well for her..."
"He absolutely violated you. He could have called the police and they could have checked on you (more likely they would have told him to mind his own business.) He could have banged on every door and window and woken you up that way. 
You were without your phone for what, half a day? 
How did he break in? 
Depending on whether you own or rent, I would take some extra precautions to tighten up your home. And of course, break up with him. "
"&gt; we discovered he spent $400 on Kratom alone. 

Yeah, I don't think a cheap ring is your problem..."
"My sister left her husband after 20 years of marriage and four kids over shit like this. 

My advice is to get this worked out now, before marriage, because once you tie the knot, it will most likely get worse, not better. Or find someone who respects you and your time and has a more egalitarian mindset.

 By the way, what's wrong with a day off anyway?  It's bad enough that he treats you like an unpaid assistant, but him having a problem with the idea you relaxing at home is pretty bonkers. Everybody needs some relaxation time. 

He can hire a maid and/or personal assistant if that's what he feels he needs since apparently he is above doing such menial tasks. You're not, though, according to him;  not only are you not above it, it's kind of what you are for.  That has to sting, not sure I could deal with it. Don't let someone take advantage of your giving nature, he doesn't sound like he appreciates you."
" - Print out all those e-mails
 - tell your friends and family, you need support.  At least tell family, if you have a good enough relationship.
 - when he's back, ask him straight up why his friends think he was on holiday with you, and why he lied to you about a business trip.  Don;t ask anything more leading than that, don;t **tell** him anything.  Just let him talk.  Why did he lie to you, what is he hiding, is there anyone else? Why South Korea.  Was he really there? 

if he starts unfolding about the adoption, ask how he got so far down the process without you being involved.  Don;t they interview couples together??

To be honest, this is huge breach of trust...  I'm not sure I could come back from something like this..."
"&gt;To clarify, I don't think for a second there's anything going on between him and this girl

...He took you along to watch his date with another girl as a birthday present. 
"
"I read your previous post. Props to you for doing the right thing for your daughters.

That woman doesn't care about you and is just trying to use you. It wasn't clear before but it is now. She wants you to buy her a house, especially now that she's out of a job. She doesn't care about you."
"Okay so as a guy who in in his position right now, with a girlfriend who is going through cancer who has similar symptoms to you all I have to say is fuck him. No seriously. 

There is no excuse for his behavior. If he is remotely emotionally competent he ought to realize that in this situation his dick and orgasms are not nearly as important as the fact that you will get days of pain. You know when it is hard to be aroused? When you are literally fighting for your life and trying not to die. Physical symptoms aside there are all of the emotional aspects of cancer that you are going through. Any number of those could also mess with someone's sex drive.

Does it sometimes suck to be in the position he is in? Yeah, totally, but significantly less that what you are going through. If he can't grasp that he in ridiculously self absorbed. What you don't do in that situation is pressure your SO into sex and if you do the accidentally or some part of you forgets for a bit you apologize and feel bad!

This is like relationship 101. Be empathetic to your partner. He clearly is not. 

If there is some part of you that is still hesitant to end this and you don't want to light the relationship on fire and walk away then the two of you need to maybe talk with a therapist about this or a doctor or honestly any figure you think he might listen to. In that case give him one chance to be a caring non shit bag. (Although if we are being honest based on the fact you have tried to talk to him about this a lot already I think he passed that point long ago.) 

Embody that badass koala in the gif I can't link here but would really like to. Just search""koala explosion imgur"" you'll find it. Walk away from this asshat. Regardless of what he has been with you through already he really has proved he isn't mature enough to deserve to be with you. This isn't a ""Oops, I'm sorry I pressured you into sex when you weren't feeling well. I totally regret doing that. How can I fix it?"" situation. This is many crazy levels beyond that. Pressuring you into daily blowjobs that you get nothing out of for the last two months while you are dealing with cancer and all the shit that goes with it is unforgivable. 

Leave OP. Don't look back. You deserve so much better.

ps: Don't totally embody that koala and use a cigarette you're smoking to light this relationship on fire as you walk away like a badass. Use matches or a zippo or whatever flammable object strikes your fancy."
How fucked up is it that she feels like she has to apologize to him for stopping him from raping her?
"this is really odd. it's not like you started dating her before he was even buried for christ's sake. 

i agree with /u/Fingusthecat ... it's one thing to have to tolerate these people on any old tuesday night, but you shouldn't have to ruin your 4th of july being treated like crap. and i also agree that she needs to get to the bottom of this. it appears you've met them a few times now, only to be treated poorly each time. had my husband's first introductions to my friends been anywhere even remotely as strained as that i would have nipped that shit in the bud. 

and what does 'give them time' even mean? it's one thing if it takes a while for some people to warm up to a stranger, but for her entire group of friends to be blatantly disdainful towards you signals something else at work here."
"*This again?  werent you here some weeks back? this is all very familiar*

Get this straight once and for all: Your husband is not *interested* in your opinion, he doesn't *respect* you or your opinions. That's why at the age of 30 he dated someone 19, so he could push you around.

"This, absolutely. Tell Kat that you want OUR HAIR to look as on point as possible for the wedding, because the pictures are forever and all that, and you want to treat her for being your bridesmaid/putting up with all this, etc etc. "
"When he next talks about making a big gesture, ask him if he's going to follow through, and if not, don't talk about it. 

Babe, you keep making promises about grand gestures hat you never follow through with. If you're not going to do it, don't talk about how you are. It just gets my hopes up for something that doesn't happen and I'd prefer you didn't. "
"That would make me nervous.  What about the other girls?  If you can't afford to pay for this entire trip yourself, you may need to start thinking about cancelling."
"Assuming you are in Australia, you should know that there is no such thing as a legal prenup, and there isn't a day on which your relationship transitions to defacto and is therefore covered by the family court in the event of a separation. Two years is a general guideline, but it depends on a large number of factors incl how integrated your finances and lives are, the kinds of financial and non financial support you've given each other, whether there are children or other dependents involved, and each party's financial needs. 

You should also be aware that binding financial agreements are never watertight in Australia, and all disputes are settled on a case by case basis. If there is a dispute, a magistrate will usually take inheritances that are received before or shortly after a relationship begins into account when deciding a property split, but it's not as if your $250k would be completely separated from whatever else you had accrued together. 

If you're concerned about this I suggest that you see a lawyer. There are ways to order your affairs that signal an intent to maintain separate finances, which can play in your favourite down the track (e.g. being tenants in common rather than joint tenants of any property you own) but at the end of the day once you've spent 10-20 years together, have children, relied on each other in times of illness and caring for each other's elderly parents a family court magistrate is going to take a lot more than your early agreement into account.

In the end, sharing a life with someone is a big deal, and involves a lot more than money. Courts in Oz are pretty fair, and if you split after five years with no shared children you'd probably come away with pretty much all of your inheritance intact. But after 30 years of combining every aspect of your life with you partner's, a separation would be messy and painful in a whole lot of non-financial ways. There's great value in being vulnerable and entering relationships wholeheartedly. If she is the right person, that won't be a mistake regardless of what happens down the road. "
This comment is gold. I haven't laughed this hard in a while.
"I would not mention it to anyone unless specifically asked ""why do your eyes look different than before?"" And even then I would only tell them if I liked them and didn't think they asked in a rude way.

"Some that come to mind:

1. Drug relapse
2. About to be arrested or some other detainment
3. Ran into someone he had a bad past with (owed money, ratted on)
4. Needed a mental break (i.e., extreme version of alone time)"
"I get what you're saying but OP, don't see those 10 years as wasted.


The goal in life isn't to have the longest relationship ever. 


You were happy in this relationship, you got things out of it. It wasn't a waste until now. From now on each day in this relationship is a day you could have been free of a cheater.

"&gt;  ""the one who thought she was going to go to Europe and be a snob"".

THIS. She has been permanently branded by her parents and I will bet anything that for the rest of her life regardless of her going to Europe or not they are going to ridicule her every choice by bringing this up over and over.

She needs to take this opportunity and just hold on as tightly as possible and not let go. Once she's done her degree and gotten a graduate degree if she wants, a job keeps her away from Australia, so be it. 

DO NOT LET GO OF THIS OPPORTUNITY."
If you guys want or need to be at the office at different times a carpool is not an option. Pretty simple. They won't hold it against you or anything. It's just normal.
"""I started crying and he said I was so selfish and manipulative crying to end the conversation. I was looking at my hands as I was so upset and FELT like a kid, and he said I didn't even have the decency to look him in the eye as he was speaking. I'm just so sad.""

OP, this guy is a professional, Olympic-level, emotional abuser. You are being beaten down in a way that you won't even realize until you get out from under. I encourage you to GTFO and I hope you do. Don't let him hide all the money from you, either."
"I'm so sorry you are dealing with this, it's a really terrible situation. 

I'm not sure you realise just how bad this is. Having a child would be the worst possible thing you could do right now. 

I think you need to have a long hard think about your life. You are still young enough that you could start a new life with someone else and do all the things you wanted to do, such as having a family. 

Do you think you could take some time away on your own? A short break so that you have time to think? I really feel that you need to spend some time away from this situation to get a bit of perspective. 

"
"I'd add something like ""I'm getting to know her better after this. Starting to make me glad I didn't recommend her for a job."""
This is perfect. Thank you.
Stop carpooling with them and drive yourself.
"I think this is a good way to think of it. But it also provides more options - if you think of it this way, you can earnestly say to her ""hey I was thinking of getting a new dye job so my hair really pops in the photos and would love to treat you to one too as a thank you and because I'd love the company, but totally cool if you're not interested!"" That way if she chooses to keep her hair you know it's because it's important to her and not just being priced out of a professional job. "
"I'm not trying to be hurtful, but when I read the title and you say you're larger than your BF's exes, I imagined you to be plus sized, not a US size 6. That's not even large ffs. 

Sounds to me like he's living in a porn fantasy. He watches porn and gets upset that he can't have sex like that with you? Does he realise porn isn't an accurate representation of sex? It also sounds like he's got all these problems about your sex life (that are apparently your fault) but doesn't seem open to doing anything about them. He just wants to be miserable and tell you it's your problem. 

Nobody should compare their current SO to their exes. In looks, personality, or sex. It's cruel, in my eyes he's trying to degrade you. I hate the part where he tells you your body ""doesn't turn him off, but doesn't turn him on either"" that's disgusting to say.

I know you say you love him and he's a great guy otherwise, but this doesn't sound like a lasting relationship. It's not your fault the only sex for him is porn sex (for the record why can't you have sex like that? A size 6 body isn't going to stop you). "
Leaving her to look after two children including one who is sick to go party is a bit selfish. It's one party. Put your family first.
"I think the first step is being honest with yourself about your feelings, which you have done. I think it's really great that you have such a good level of self awareness about this, and that you aren't blaming them for it or lashing out. 

I think it might be a good idea to try and get some space from them. I don't mean cut them off or not see them, just try and branch out a bit more. Do other activities, meet new people, make new friends so that you are less dependent on them for socialising. 

Bare in mind that this is the honeymoon phase of their relationship. Right now they are going to be super in to each other and they won't have much room for anyone else in their lives. For most people this dials down a bit and most people manage to become a bit more balanced and leave enough room in their lives for their friends. At the same time you have to be accepting that this is the new status quo and they will be each other's priority now. 

You are still going to have uncomfortable feelings about this, there will still be times when you feel jealous or sad about their relationship. I think a helpful technique for dealing with this is mindfulness. It might be useful to think of your sadness and jealousy as an unhelpful voice in your mind. So when you are socialising with them and something they do or say triggers that negative voice, tell yourself this is just your jealousy and sadness talking and you don't need to listen to that voice. You can chose to behave from a place of friendship, compassion and love. 

It sounds to me that you are a caring person with a good level of emotional maturity and self awareness. I really think you can handle this. 

"
"First of all, doesn't seem like this is your problem. It's your boyfriends problem. 

$100 might seem like a lot now, but it's a relatively cheap way to find out someone (T) is a shitty friend. So think of it as a $100 lesson learned. "
"This is going to hurt; you need to change your behavior.

Yes, it's harsh, but you can't expect any SO to just deal with you being ""overly sensitive."" 

Constant nagging, questioning, and crying will put any SO on edge or make them silent. 

Crying and arguing over cuddling tendencies near 1:00 AM - 4:30 AM and then getting upset about it? Really?"
Lockbox. Seriously. You can get a pretty cheap one. 
"You need to speak to your parents together so your father doesn't get a chance to sweep this under a rug with your mother. Explain that you felt personally victimised by the comments they made regarding Asian people and that under no circumstances will you ever return to that church. Tell your dad that you are ""disappointed in him as a father"" because someone was making racists comments directed at you and your mothers race and he did nothing to defend the people that he is supposed to protect. 
If he tries to palm their comments off as a joke, well jokes are only fun when you're not on the receiving end. They belittled you and they knew it. He knew it and shrugged it off.

Edit: I'm sorry you had to experience this. You deserve better. "
Yea they are definitely rushing into it. What can you do? Not much. They'll ignore any sensible advise you give. The only thing you can convince them is to have a long engagement. 
"Seriously. OP, this is on your girlfriend. She needs to figure out why they're treating you like this and let you know so you all can sit down and chat like  adults. This passive-aggressiveness nonsense has to stop. "
"&gt; What should I tell him?

You told him you gained weight already. Believe him when he says that it doesn't matter. And work on feeling secure and happy; if your self-esteem is low and you believe you don't deserve him, you're more likely to put up with behavior you wouldn't otherwise."

/u/liedtobyparent, you are just starting your journey into adulthood by moving outf to college. Feel angry at them if you desire, but it'll really not do you a lot of good. Try to learn from their mistakes to become a better person yourself, but being a better person also must include not judging other people too harshly (which is not the same as not being mindful of the people you can really trust, or that you surround yourself with).

It's OK to be disillusioned for a while.

"
"You said that you held off on even expressing your beliefs at dinner because you thought they'd judge you and think less of you for them... So it is not surprising that choosing to express your beliefs at a big family event like a wedding is giving them some hurdles to jump over. If they are paying for it and since they made their request fairly respectfully, I'd consider paying for the tarot reader at your bachelorette or the after party or something. Religious people find mysticism scary and think its mocking religion and/or evil depending on their sect. Perchance it hits a bit too close to home for their comfort. "

the above is a good enough reason to not recommend someone for a job, even if one *does* like the party in question."
"You're acting like he is in the position of power here. He is not.

"Hey! I'm a bit older than you, but when I was your age I was a full-time young carer for a single mum with depression. Maybe I can help you to help your mum. :) 

The best thing here is that you notice her 'sparkle' is gone. Are you close? Maybe one night say 'Hey mum, I'm really bored, can you show me how you do [craft]?' A big thing for her is that right now, she is being a single parent. Try to step up a little, if you're not already. Do the dishes, or some laundry. Ask her if she wants help cooking that night or if she wants to watch anything on the TV. 

Try asking her if she wants to go for a walk, or if she wants to go to the shopping center or grab some dinner out together. She misses your Dad, remind her that you are all in this together. :) 

Feel free to PM if you want to vent or need any advice.

**EDIT** It's just occurred to me that I didn't mention the most important thing! If *you* are having any trouble with this, don't be afraid to talk it out with someone. Schools often have counselling available for free and they won't tell your parents if you don't want them too, or Reddit is a great place to find a safe community to vent. "
Yess exactly. If you were some dude it would be weird. But since you both really like each other it's cute
"So your dad's an asshole and when your BF tried to keep the peace by not engaging, your dad insisted on making a scene and causing a fight.  Your boyfriend tried to de-escalate by leaving, and your dad gets even louder.  Also:  

&gt;they're my parents, and it's my birthday, he kind of has to come to dinner.

No, he doesn't.  And he shouldn't.  You forced him knowing that your dad was going to start shit and now you're pissed that everything happened exactly as you should have predicted.  Instead of standing up to your father, who caused all the problems, you're taking out your inability to create boundaries and expect him to act like a damned adult on your Boyfriend, who is apparently supposed to roll over and give in to anything your father demands just so nobody's mad.

All you had to do was not force your BF to hang out with an asshole.

&gt;I am very bad at communicating my needs when I feel like it will make the other person upset, so maybe I just haven't communicated how much this has affected me properly.

No, you have.  You're just completely off-base with what your reaction should be.  You want your boyfriend to put up with the same abuse and shit that your father puts you through just so you don't have to confront daddy about his terrible behavior.

&gt;I feel like I'm going to be abandoned or wholly rejected, and that is certainly happening here.

You are, but not for the reasons you think.  If your BF were here, we'd be telling him to rethink this whole proposition and consider leaving you.  He's pulling back because he's starting to get glimpses of how his life (and every birthday and holiday) are going to be.  

YOU need to decide what side you're going to be on - your father's or your boyfriend's.  If it's your dad, you're probably going to wind up single, and fighting an uphill battle with every guy you want to date over this.  If it's your boyfriend, you need to stop allowing your father to stop all over you, your boundaries, your SO, and your life.  That may mean limiting contact even further or cutting him out entirely.  

I mean, you're fucking *30* and you roll over like a dog every time your dad snaps his fingers."
What was her reaction? How did she take it? Inquiring minds would like to know.
"If you don't feel anything for him you need to stop putting him in positions where he feels like he has a chance with you. It might feel nice, but it's ultimately self-serving since you know he has feelings for you. Stop giving in, you're sending mixed messages. "
"Would you want someone to tell you?

I would.  "
"Agree with this. Don't cross an ocean for someone who won't jump a puddle for you.

Also I recommend reading a blog called ""Must be this tall to ride."" Some hindsight from a divorced guy. It's easier to call off an engagement than to get a divorce."
"Well I guess he could be secretly negotiating with someone to buy you a Cadillac, but yes, cheating seems way more likely. 

YBH your best bet is to come straight out with this: ""Who are you calling? Why are you being so secretive about your phone? I don't want to be *that* wife and jump to conclusions, but you have to admit this looks super sketchy; I'd rather you told me than imagine the worst. Also, btw, regarding couples therapy, get your ass into gear and make some space in your diary because this needs to happen""
"
"&gt; Don't people tend to peak at like 35?

Personally and professionally, sure! Fertility wise, not so much. It is a shitty fact of biology women are most fertile (meaning they have the greatest chance of conceiving in any given cycle and the best chance of carrying a healthy pregnancy to term) in their late teens/early 20s (as in ages 18-24).

**And that suuuuucks**. Because it is vanishingly rare for those biologically ideal years to also be financially, professionally, and psychologically ideal. 

Not only is it more difficult to get pregnant in your late 30s, pregnancy over age 35 is labeled 'advanced maternal age' by the medical establishment and comes with increased risk factors for both pregnancy complications (including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia) and chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome (the risk of giving birth to a child with Down Syndrome at age 20 is 1 in 1,667; at age 30 it's 1 in 952; at age 40 the risk is 1 in 106). 

It is still ABSOLUTELY possible and common for women to give birth to healthy children in their 30s and 40s, but I wrote all this up because you're a 27 year old dude...and you might be around women in a similar age range. As a just turned 30-year-old woman, it was *so frustrating* to me when my male friends would speak blithely about putting off kids until their late 30s or their 40s and assume that I could make the same choice free of consequences.

"He's dating this girl literally in front of your face and disrespecting you (and your fam) left and right. On your bday! Why're you okay with being treated this way?

Then make sure you don't let anyone else you date disrespect you like this. "

Emotionally abusive all the way. All of what he says is guilt tripping and more manipulation. Call a lawyer and start the process and maybe get ye to therapy. This isnt healthy and he has serious issues. His poor boy is going to grow up thinking thats the way to treat other people. Unacceptable.

He was terrified you were lying to him but had absolutely no problem lying to you. No.  Just fucking no.
"&gt;What could be going through her mind?

Likely, a ton of crippling fear and depression. She already lost her mom, now she is facing losing her sibling and her nephew. 

That's a lot for anyone to face.

&gt;Should I stop trying to contact her?

If she isn't replying, it's a pretty clear indicator that she wants to be alone right now. 

I'd stick with: ""I'll be here if you need me"" and leave it at that. 

&gt;Should I be upset with her? 

Depressed or not, she would be able to a least give you a heads up, or an explanation. Right now, though, I think you being upset with her is the least of her worries.

&gt;Should I think it’s over?

It is definitely looking that way. 


&gt; Am I being selfish / impatient? 

No, I think you have actually been really patient. 

What she's going through is awful. She still shouldn't have ghosted you. At this point, I'm pretty sure this relationship is over. "
Lawyer up. No one on reddit will be able to give you the help a professional can. 
"Your boyfriend took the woman he wanted to take.

Period.

If he wanted you there, he would have made sure you understood you were skipping out on a fancy, important company function to babysit.  (which I assume is something you could have found a replacement sitter for had you know it was a super important black tie affair)

But he didn't tell you.  He asked you a couple times if you had plans that weekend, but never really let you know why he was asking.  Because he knew that if you knew it was a fancy dinner party/event, you'd rearrange your babysitting.

Then he wouldn't be able to take the girl he wanted to take.  And make no bones about it, he took the woman he WANTED to take.

I don't really see what there is to discuss.  After over 2 years together, he lied to your face multiple times, went on a fancy date with another woman, dance romantically with her, and then lied again to cover his tracks.

And he can't claim he didn't know he needed a date til the last second.  Companies that throw large black tie affairs let their employees know well in advance.  These things are planned out and employees are told about it so they can rent tuxes and shit.

No company says ""hey we're having a party"" then drops cinderellas fucking ball in their lap.

I'll say it again.  

He took the woman he wanted to take.  Period.  

You can hear him out, but whats the point?  You know he is untrustworthy.  You know he will do shit with other women behind your back.  And you have no way of ever trusting that he didn't sleep with this woman.

Get yourself an STD test and move the fuck on...because this guy is not long term relationship material."
"It sounds harsh, but a little shame and embarrassment wouldn't hurt here. If he looks at her like ""wtf is wrong with you"" she'd probably stop pretty quick.

Also, if OP can convince his wife to tease her about it in a ""I hear you have a crush on my husband"" sort of way then hopefully she'll be too embarrassed to keep doing it. Plus it'll look like OP and his wife are united and aren't going to be broken up by a teenager."
"&gt; Later I found out he used his son's gift card I gave him

looooooooooool so are you just afraid of being alone or is he super hot or what about this guy appears so great you are willing to stay with a douche who takes HIS OWN CHILD'S PRESENT to buy yours bc he's apparently too cheap to spend his own money on you.

Literally stole his kid's present to ""regift"" it to you.

You can do better."
Your partner is not meant to make you feel terrible about yourself. The opposite actually. Yet that's exactly what he's doing. It sounds as though no girl is ever going to satisfy his unrealistic sexual and physical preferences. I really think you should reconsider being in a relationship with him. 
"For an man dating a significantly younger women, that knowledge gap is part of the appeal.  It lets an average man feel very smart and competent, much more so than he would comparing himself to a peer.  It's more likely to cause problems when you catch up and the deficit is smaller and he's not so impressive in comparison anymore.

"Maybe pointing out that it would have been bad for your career to refer someone who reacts she way she reacted to this particular setback (complaining, placing the burden for her life on someone else, spreading rumors, slandering you, etc) would help?

"Also, you might take into consideration that she will probably treat your child the same way she treated you (and other people)."
Yeah. It's one thing to resent a budget because your wife wants a mansion or your girlfriend wants a huge engagement ring. It's entirely another thing to be upset that you have to set aside money for food so your wife doesn't have to starve. It makes me wonder about the mental sanity of OP.

Really frustrating, but I just hope that they'll start to 'get it' eventually."
"Yes, I am positive. Her friend asked her how she plans on bringing this up with her future husband since it's his daughter they are talking about and Maria said that she will figure something out and that she has her ways. "
This happened to me very recently with my wife. The only difference is they had gotten to the stage where they were flirting over text messages. I had told her this exact thing almost verbatim and things are slowly getting better. I told my wife workplaces crushes happen and it's not something you can really avoid but it is how you act upon those feelings that can damage relationships and trust.

She stole that money from you and your father.  He is right to be pissed.  He didn't put money into an account for you so your mom could have a fancy car and expensive house.  My guess is in a few years you'll begin to see your mom for who she is and not who you want her to be.

Good luck!"
"You are absolutely doing the right thing in keeping your children away from her children.  While it is neither possible nor desirable to shelter your children from the realities of the world, it is common sense not throw them into a situation where they can be negatively influenced at an early age.

Eventually they will be exposed to the racists and the drug users and drug dealers of the world, but the longer you can influence their education and help to development how they the world, the better.

In other words, the bad elements of the world will be upon them soon enough, there is no need to accelerate it by exposing them to your sister's dysfunctional family. "

"So I see two separate issues here - one, how fixated you are on your son when you're not with him, and two your thinking that you aren't supposed to be so close/involved with your child. 

The first one sounds like anxiety to me, which you should consider seeing a therapist about - because it's not healthy. Postpartum emotional issues can happen in both spouses, but it's also possibly you already had anxiety issues that are suddenly brought into focus. 

The second is just, honestly, a little sad to me. My dad stayed home with me as a kid, and it was the best thing. I'm still extremely close to both my mom and dad, and part of that is because of how involved they were in my life at all stages. 

You created another human being. Of course you are emotionally attached. "
Seriously. What a story. The SM is treating the Mom like the 5 year old she is and it's working.
"Is this the same bf that said he doesn't love you in your other post about 5 months ago? Also $300 isn't that much, sure it's not pocket change but it shouldn't be that difficult to save up that much over a few months. So unless he's not financially responsible that shouldn't be an issue. Just be patient you shouldn't rush into an engagement or marriage. If he isn't financially responsible I suggest you guys take a trip over to r/personalfinance for some assistance, it will help down the road. 

On top of this if this is the same bf that is 18 and I'm assuming your close to the same age, don't rush into marriage at such a young age at least wait for after college. People change so much when they are as young as you two. At the same time if you do move ahead with this course there is nothing wrong with staying engaged for several years, and definitely spend a few years living together before marriage to make sure you are ok with being around each a lot. "
"Yup. He thought it was a night with the ""girlfriends"" and just stoped by to see if OP is actually home and if yes, whether or not there are any dudes around."
"When i read ""our relationship is mostly ok"" i thought to the steryotype about this sub, how people say that but then bury the lead about a lot negative stuff.

This was worse than anything i could come up with. This has to be a troll...right?"
"Holy shit no don't say any of those things. You also don't really need to show him your wedding budget. If everything is already paid for and the only thing he put money towards is the dress, that's literally all he needs to see - the dress budget. I get that you want to stand up to this guy for being a turd of a dad, but it's not going to 1) make him change or 2) make your fiancee happy or comfortable. Just suck it up and try to make the meeting go smoothly as possible, focus on being the best partner you can be to your wife, show her by example what a good husband and father is, and call your dad and tell him you love him."
Let her be single then.  Stop trying. 
"If you can back out, then 100% back out. People can control their actions. Please stop pretending you can't. If you did 'do something' stupid, then it would be your conscious choice to do so. So let's not pretend it is out of your control. 

Also, if you do go, then don't go sight seeing. Keep it professional. Tell her that you said yes in the moment but want to keep everything professional and want to go sight seeing by yourself. 

From the sound of it, you actually do want to cheat on your wife. If not, then this would be a really easy thing to navigate. "
"If we put your post and your comments together, we see that you have not gained weight in 4 years, that your BMI is in the very low normal range, that your boyfriend compares you to other women unfavourably, and he won't follow through on doing anything to eat better/exercise with you.  We see that his comments have been cruel enough to cause you to cry and starve yourself.

This isn't ok and this isn't healthy.  If he wants you to be underweight, that is an incredibly bad thing.  Comparing you to others is cruel.

OP...this isn't how a good, loving partner would tall to you or treat you.  If you want to tone up for YOURSELF regardless of what he thinks, get a trainer.  If you feel like you should lose weight because of him, walk away from him, because he is causing you psychological distress that could lead to disordered eating."
"I wouldn't call this porn. I think there's a difference between watching porn, which is of performers with whom you have no personal connection, and watching sex tapes of you and your ex. "
"Take the job, ditch the boyfriend. He's a toxic presence in your life that will only drag you down. If you stay with this person, you will end up poor and broken of spirit by the time you're his age.  "
"Nice detective work! You've got the answer you wanted, and now it's time to block this person from all possible angles and move on your life. Anything else you do will only encourage them, and you really don't want to do that in case they escalate (and start contacting you or your partner's employers, or other levels of madness).

&gt; Believe I found the jilted girl behind public fake account Facebook cheating allegations... a catfisher! **How do I confront her?**

DO NOT CONFRONT THEM. Please! Any contact will only encourage them that their methods are working.

I know confronting them is fun (and you'll probably get some encouragement for it from here, 'cos we all love juicy updates and faked 'evidence') but there is nothing to be gained from continuing to give this person the attention they're after.

Time to move on."
"&gt;I haven't talked to him since yesterday what should I do?

Aside from never talk to him again? Talk to him one more time to break up with him and then never talk to him again.  

Why do you think you deserve this sort or treatment? Don't accept any excuses, because abusive people are ALWAYS full of excuses."
"Im dating a man from Quebec, Canada who is fully bilingual (French/English) and yet i am from England. I learnt Spanish in school, but i use the term ""learnt"" very loosely. Its similar to french so i can pick up the occasional word or sentence, but languages have NEVER been a strong point for me, and yet Quebecois take their french culture pretty damn seriously. Even the younger generation. This has never been a problem for me and socializing with my BF friends / family also. Only once have i ever felt truly excluded, but everyone was drunk and i made sure my SO knew it upset me. It has never happened since. 

Him AND his friends make an effort, even when conversing in french, to translate the key points or even funny moments of any french conversation to me in English. I in turn use the occasional french words in my sentences that i know, and we all get by just fine. You need to sit your BF down and explain the impact this has on you. If he is not willing to modify it, even a little, and assist you with integration into his language, then you may need to look at whether this relationship can survive long term. Its about give and take. In return for him speaking more English, you must learn a little more Spanish. 

There needs to be a balance between the two. 

(edit: a word)"
You didnt use the word 'moist' i think its key to use it at least three times.
"Life with you isn't a show on Netflix you cause pause for years, maybe even watch something else, and then resume when convenient.  If she's all that, they can date her."
"&gt; when I made that joke about my mom being a better driver he was greatly insulted and thinks I was way out of line for saying that derogatory remark.

This part also stood out to me. It's *derogatory* to say that his wife is better than him at this one thing? Wow.
"
Situations like this are usually a pretty good illustration of what type of person someone is. When they see something good happen for another person are happy for that person? Or are they angry it didn't happen for them? Your girlfriend is the latter and it likely runs very deep to an underlying personality that is utterly self-absorbed. Think very carefully about what you want in a partner because this one is showing her true colours.
"Personally, the only time I ever feel uncomfortable in someone's home is when they don't make it inviting to me. There's a person whose house my husband and I sometimes go to, and it's not spotless or anything. But the homeowner never makes us feel very invited. We knock on the door, he lets us in, and that's that. No ""Feel free to take a seat on the couch"" or ""You can take your shoes off here"" or ""Can I get you anything to drink?"". I think he just assumes we'll make ourselves at home, but we aren't close enough in the slightest to be comfortable doing that. 

I wonder how much of a host OP is, if this is perhaps the same scenario. "
"&gt;She still forces me to go

She can't physically manhandle you on to the flight. Just don't go. This is not OK.

&gt;would never allow my mom to visit me 

Your mom could've still visited. She'd have had to stay at a hotel, but nothing was stopping you two from seeing each other if she came (unless she can't afford a hotel). If your wife wouldn't ""let you"" see her even if she came to your city, you need to seriously think about whether or not you want to be with someone who thinks they're entitled to control you. You should also ask yourself why you accept these decisions your wife makes and go along with it? I'm not trying to blame you. You're allowed to have a relationship with your mother, and if you go along with your wives decisions because you're scared of the repercussions if you don't, you need to start looking in to resources for people in abusive relationships. Because that is not ok, and you are allowed to make your own decisions.

The website loveisrespect is a good start."
"Most people will find these to be harmless jokes. Personally, I think it's a little weird to dress your kid in a onesie that implies they were unplanned (""all mommy wanted was a back rub""), but it's something that's in right now &amp; that most people consider normal. 

Which one of you dresses the baby? Maybe you can take responsibility for dressing him on days when you'll be going out together, which means you can choose his outfit? And Mom can bring out her favorite onesies to her heart's content on days she's running errands without you?"
"Of course he knows it's fucked up, he just doesn't care. He cares more about getting attention from other girls than he cares about *your* feelings.

Date someone who is proud to be with you and who cares about you. You've been on-and-off for so long because the relationship is not working. Stop trying to force it."
"You have posted a lot of stuff about this girl, man. 

She. Is. Fucking. With. You.

Don't let her. Don't contact her. Don't let her contact you."
"I think you just need to explain your reasoning to her. Maybe make it very clear to her that you gave rides to your Ex under pressure, didn't like it and resolved not to do it again. 

I can see why this gets under her skin and possibly makes her feel a little insecure. 

Your motorcycle is clearly something you are very passionate about. You shared that experience with your Ex, but you refuse to share it with your current girlfriend. Perhaps this worries her and she feels that you don't care about her as much or don't feel as close to her as you did your ex, because you don't want to share this with her as well. I'm not saying this means you have to give her rides, but just have a little compassion that this might have a deeper meaning for her. "
Please tell your father you are scared of this man and need help leaving. This is your best opportunity to do so. You will never get another chance like this again. 
I mean you can ignore this flaming red flag if you want but Jesus Christ.  Come on lady.

"He has been trying to convince me that when he stopped over he didn't think about it. He says he didn't think it was creepy at all because we have been dating four months. He ACTUALLY didn't end up dropping off the gift because he left it at his house. So, he came back the next day. Weird huh?"
"Please talk to him right this second, not before his trip is over. Tell him exactly this."
[deleted]
"I don't think the problem is that he doesn't understand why you were upset. I think the problem is that he wanted to have sex with you anyway, even though you didn't want it, and he thought you'd feel too scared or awkward to stop him. Talking to him will probably not solve this problem. This guy is dangerous."
"He's 14 years older and using you for sex. You don't just stop using condoms without talking about it, you let him totally steam roll you for that. Doesn't talk for extended periods of time? Weird, a text to say your busy takes all of 5 seconds. Finally, pushing you in bed and talking about putting cameras in dressing rooms is just straight up creepy. He's a creepy older man looking to manipulate a younger woman to do what he wants. Find a man your own age that respects your boundaries."
"Listen, sorry if this is harsh.
Tell them no, sorry.
What does your husband say? Tbh, if I was him, I would take my child, and leave. Don't let them move in, they will ruin your marriage, and your life.
If you can't say it, ask hibby too.
""Its my home too, and  I have decided we cannot help you. You will have to make other arrangments""
Then just repeat. If they show up, don't answer. 
I'm serious, they will wreck your home, your marriage, your childs childhood. 
Again, I'm sorry if this is harsh, but don't make this mistake. Please."
"You both sound horrible. Your wife was dealing with a sick baby and post partum, and you have an emotional affair? Was there really no way you could get out of that work trip so soon after your wife giving birth to your child? Then you lied about it?

She is done with you, and probably has been done with you for a long time now. And I can't really blame her."
"I have a similar story. My Dad was doing his hospital residency (he's an oral surgeon/dentist) and my Mom was a scrub nurse at the hospital. The story I always heard was love at first sight, blah, blah, blah. 

Well, one day I was looking through my Dad's dental school yearbooks (that was a thing in the late 60s I guess) and there's a picture with the caption ""Dr. EightySixTheWorldsDad with his wife, Stephanie."" Hmmm. Mom's name is not Stephanie. 

So I ask my Mom, who casually throws it out there that no, she did not change her name. My Dad was married to another woman when they met. He cheated on Stephanie (who was a teacher and paid my Dad's way through dental school as a side note) with my Mom and he just walked out of Stephanie's house one day and never came home. Gross, right?

That day was pretty life-changing. I could not understand how to put all the pieces together and what to think of my Dad, but what was worse was having to negotiate my feelings on what my mother had done. 

Four years later, guess what?!? My Dad walked out of our lives for our baby sitter and never looked back. It's been 22 years since my Dad left. We have no relationship. 

I hate to be ""that guy"" but things may never go back to normal for you. My Dad once told me (in relation to a different situation) that it is difficult to come to terms with the fact that are parents are just people and they make bad choices all the time. He was right. Certainly we have all made mistakes and will continue to as life goes on. The real matter is whether we learn from them and try to fix them and ourselves as we go. Unfortunately from what I saw from my Dad, he has never conquered his demons. Consequently he is reaching the golden years of his life without his family. 

I am sorry you are going through this. I can't really offer much advice except the old adage that time heals all wounds. 
"
"According to my bf, she has attempted suicide several times due to her ED and because of that her family is constantly walking on eggshells around her. I'm kinda scared I'll indirectly cause her to try to attempt suicide again or something similar and his family will end up hating me as a result. "
"FWIW: leaving your car unlocked and empty as a burglary-safeing technique has a long history and is well documented.  You're right.  He's wrong.  People who want to steal the whole car don't care much about door locks anyway, that's not how it works anymore.

&gt; He refuses to admit he did wrong.

He literally committed felony larceny.

Yeah, your boyfriend is a prideful idiot.  Don't let him off the hook.  You can't ""get through"" to him per se, though eventually he should be able to recognize how upset you are and learn to better honor your desires.

Or you could dump his ass.  Whatever."
"This may be the funniest, most succinct comment I've ever read on this sub. "
"Some people have hard limits when it comes to infidelity and the people that have affairs with someone that's married.  You just found out that being the other woman in your friend's marriage is a character flaw that your ex fiancé is unwilling to accept.

I don't agree that name calling during an argument is acceptable.  But I also don't agree that remaining friends with the married man you had a affair with, while his wife stands innocently by, is acceptable.

This is going to be a post where you will get widely divergent opinions.  Because people have different opinions and limits on emotional subjects like infidelity.  Your ex has the opinion that it's unacceptable under any circumstance."
Why are you married to someone who torments you for his own amusement?
"Few things you need to remember.

1). 5 months, Not a one night stand or a week of wrongjudgement

2). He lied and deceived a 23 year old junior into an affair.This is the scummiest of all the stuff.  She had nothing to do with your marriage. Imagine the amount of lies he must have told her. Is she even the first one ? 

3) He was too much of a coward to confess. The other woman forced him. 


&gt;some floozy

 floozy ? This woman was lied and cheated by your husband into having an affair. She tried to help you by reveal the affair and you call her a floozy  ? "
"Not to mention that he revealed the ""prank"" in front of his friends for exponential humiliation of OP. Fuck. That. "

"Seriously, she starved for a month because his addiction took away all her money and she literally couldn't afford to eat and she didn't even put him on the blast then he deserved because it didn't even fucking occur to him that his wife needed to eat. Not once did he ever think about his wife having money to eat. Not even for a second.  And she just got through it. And then he actually had the gall to come at her with you're being anorexic and you're the problem here. Jesus."
"Are there  things you and your siblings can do to cheer her up? At 15, you're old enough to make the occasional breakfast or dinner. You're old enough to help with the housecleaning.

She's a damn Crazy-Whisperer!
"Speaking as someone who also lost their mom and who's dad recently remarried, you need to tell him NOW.  Stuff like this doesn't just disappear after they get married.  If she's jealous of something so petty that's she's telling people she doesn't want your sister at your dad's wedding, it's only going to get much, much worse.  Mature, well-adjusted adults do not say shit like this, even when they're venting, 19 year olds do.  What happens when grandchildren are added to the mix?  Family vacations?   Holidays?  Property when someone dies? 

Your dad took care of you, you owe it to your dad to make sure he has this very important information before committing his life to someone else.  Let HIM decide what he wants to do about it.  Wouldn't you want someone you love and trust to do the same for you?"
"Do not move in with him until he has learned some skills.  Not so much about handyman skills, but I am going to guess that he does not know how to do the 'emotional labour' of running a household - e.g. bills, maintenance, laundry, health appts etc...  (This is just a guess and I could be out of line here, but it would fit with the general picture).

Do not combine finances with him.  This guy is living beyond his means and does not know how to budget. At 26, isn't he *embarrassed* at using his mommy's credit card for his big purchases??

"
Have you talked to your doctor? It's possible you have vaginismus or something else physiological going on. 
"To answer your specific question in your post, what you should do is leave her alone. If she’s in counseling she is probably acting upon the advice her therapist has given her (to remove herself from the situation until she has sufficiently calmed down) and interacting with her in this state will only reinforce bad behavior. "
"He sounds horrible and emotionally/financially controlling/abusive. 

Is there a trusted person that you can talk to about all this? You need a support system. I'm really sorry you're going through this."
"I had the same dilemma, although not with all the background issues. I just didn't know whose name I wanted. Here's what I suggest. Put all the pressure from both sides on the back burner.  Say your first name with your fiance's last out loud to yourself. Pretend to introduce yourself to someone with his last name. Write it down and see how you feel about how it looks on paper. Once you've heard it/seen it, it will help you put in perspective how you feel about it. You should definitely keep your fiance and family's opinions in mind but at the end of the day, it is your name. You should like how it sounds, how it looks, and how you feel about it. You can also consider the middle name option as that seems like a decent compromise. 

In case you're wondering, I ended up keeping my name. His last name just doesn't seem to fit with mine. It hasn't caused any issues at all. "
"Having been your ""wife"" in this situation before with my partner, I was stubborn, too, and thought that as long as I told my partner everything about my work friendship, it was all ok. We were all adults who could manage our emotions, right? Let me play this out for you for the next year if this continues:

- The work spouse will confess he has a crush on her, too, or is at the very least, confused and doesn't know what to do about it.
- One or both of them will think their fantasy relationship with no real basis in life outside of work will be worth ending their marriages. And trust me, it is a fantasy. At work, they are their best selves and only show what they want to show others. 
- One or both might wake up and realize they're not right for each other and seek counseling with their true spouses to make this work but... the pull continues at work to spend time together and recapture the friendship they had. But it's NOT friendship -&gt; it's now intimacy and hopefully, no physical borders have been crossed.
- The truth is this: You cannot get over someone when you see them everyday AND hey respond favorably to you, too. You absolutely cannot get over someone in that close a proximity, physically and emotionally no matter what you know intellectually you should be doing.

My partner knew that forbidding me from having a work spouse would be the quickest way to upset me, so we played out this scenario above and it ended with me in a new job (which is why that advice is often repeated here). I'm happy to say our relationship is more back on track and his unwavering support for me was a huge part of my growing pains. 

Like him, you are being the bigger person here, and I admire your resolve to make this work and be understanding of her needs, too. Maybe show your wife this post and our responses? It helped me a lot to read about other people who understood what I was going through and seeing the tough love in black and white. 

EDIT: It did take me a few months to find a new job, too, but starting it now will at least reduce the amount of time she is at this company. "
"Depends. One of my married friends would be fine with it as her view is they are a partnership so only one needs to say..however they really are a partnership as in 50/50 on the childcare and household stuff.  None of that calling themselves partners while she does most of the work.

Most of my married friends would be bitter and resentful. They would feel shortchanged as once again it falls unto her to. Iss out for the kids sake. And that her husband feels partying is more important than the welfare of their child.

You being a douche would depend on her view and how much you actually put in. Such as if you go to the party then next time you stay home with the sick kid(s) and she parties without you be it a girls night club or whatever."
"This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I do believe there are people out there who really can't learn to indulge responsibly, whether that be the more common vices like drinking or gambling, or stuff like this.

Or maybe they can, but they'd have to learn the hard way - by ruining all their relationships in the process - so it's probably better for them in the long run if they don't even try."
"I think you should first encourage your wife to go to therapy to work through her past abuse.  To you and outside observers, it may seem baffling why she would put up with this and not just cut this asshole out of her life, but that's part of the pattern of abuse and control.  He's conditioned her to think this is all normal.  She probably doesn't even see how bad it is because she's so used to it.  Some therapy might get her to see that this isn't normal and that she does deserve better.  Then maybe she can start untangling herself from his control.

Further, just do your best to support your wife.  Don't guilt her or get angry with her about her contact with her father.  "
"CPS doesn't take a baby from a good mom.  Hell, they don't take a baby from a bad mom. They take a baby from an *abusive* mom. To have your baby taken from you is not an overnight thing--it's a long, involved process--with numerous people declaring you unfit. 
We know this. Others know this. No one (but your sister) will blame you (or your mom). This was not your doing. "

"She thinks it makes her better than the average person if she doesn't like popular things AND makes sure everyone around her knows just how much she doesn't like it. See, her tastes are so much better than your average sheeple. She's not like those other dumb, daft girls that watch *popular* things or use Instagram.

I've known people like this, and it's really exhausting to be around. Everyone can cite an example of something they think is incredibly stupid and doesn't deserve its success but is wildly popular regardless, but the fact is: most things are popular because they are, in fact, good, or at least amusing enough to provide a worthwhile distraction.

Start asking questions. Don't leave a comment unchallenged. When she says ""that sounds stupid"", ask ""why? What sounds stupid about it?"". Press her for specifics. Has she seen a trailer? Does she know anything about it? Why is it *stupid*? It has near-universal critical acclaim (92% on Rotten Tomatoes) from professional critics. All of those people must be pretty stupid, I guess?

If she admits ""because it's popular"", ask why that's so bad. Why is it bad to like something that a lot of other people like? If a lot of people are seeing it, then it's probably good, right? Cite a piece of media you like that's popular that she has a neutral or positive opinion on. ""I like [popular media] and that's popular, do you think that's stupid?"" Or a piece of popular media you got her to try and liked. ""You liked [media] even if it was popular, right?""

Force her, by way of gentle questioning, to examine her opinions below surface level. Why does popular = stupid? Is she afraid of someone judging her? Does she think it makes her superior to other people? What is so much better about her interests compared to anyone else's?

If she's smart, she'll eventually face the fact that it's a really stupid way to be and doesn't make you any less shallow than the people who just watch things because they're popular - you're refusing to engage in fun things you could potentially enjoy because other people already enjoyed them. That's the epitome of shallow and unthinking.

If she doesn't, well, you get to decide if her being negative and snobby all the time is a dealbreaker for you or not. She might grow out of it eventually like other people are saying, but it's going to happen a lot faster with external pressure."

"&gt; Lacy only wants to invite the BF to her wedding if he cooks for the whole event.

That's shitty behaviour as you're well aware. As Carly is close family, she should get a +1 invitation without any conditions.

Carly is perfectly right and you should stick to your guns and tell Lacy this.

A professional chef for an event would easily cost a minimum of several hundred dollars, plus for 90-100 guests you'd need extra staff, before you even got on to the unit cost per seating. Lacy has jumped the shark if she thinks it is a fair exchange to hand out an invitation to her wedding in exchange for this level of service.

In addition, it is unreasonable that a ""guest"" to the wedding should be working, with the exception of members of the wedding party (e.g. best man and bridesmaids)

tl;dr; tell Lacy she's being foolish and there is no way you'll get involved in this.

**Edit** For some reason all the replies have been querying cost. I'm assuming he's good chef, famous in his city but not the country. My quote of several hundred dollars was just his fee **not** the cost per plate * 100."

Can you tell him you want to schedule a couple's counseling appointment because you want to talk to him and you're tired of him screaming at you?
I'd be petty and just start wearing bizarre things for a while. 
"Uh, ya, I would literally cry if I was her receiving such a thoughtful present. Wow OP you really outdid yourself, she's lucky to have you. Have more confidence, this is an amazing gift! Though I think you did set the bar really high for next years present LOL"
"&gt;I've spoken to him about it again and again. At the last party, the second girl talked to him in Spanish, and he replied in Spanish, and I ended up poking him and saying loudly ""in English, please"". He still kept doing it.

Sounds like he knows the issue (its not like you didnt mention it to him many times before) but just doesnt care enough."
"Um, her parents won't let her. Isn't that all the proof you need that she isn't right for you? She's still ruled by her parental units. "
"I had an ex that did this exact thing to me. It causes an unreal number of fights. I accepted that he thought he was joking around with me, and stuck around. Looking back, I now know it was one of the first signs of the abusive hell I would live through for the next half a decade. 

He knew it wasn't a joke, and so does your husband. It's a manipulative mind game he uses to both control your reactions and insult you by joking. You may have heard this phrase used on this sub before: Schrodinger's asshole. It's not a joke if your not upset, but it's just a joke if you're upset. 

I truly hope your husband's controlling manipulation doesn't evolve any further, but I am sure you can look at other aspects of your relationship and see similar control issues. He isn't communicating with you, and he is invalidating your feelings, thoughts, and emotions. He gets to push his joke until you give in, or you refuse and then he gets to insult you. Those are the two options you live with. There's a third option: get the hell out. 

This is rarely a behavior that's modifiable, and therapy grants abusers additional leverage techniques, which in turn makes them more dangerous. He's your husband, and you have built a life with him. You've discussed this issue repeatedly with him blaming you, insulting you, and refusing any modicum of responsibility. Tell him once, not during an incident, that you will not tolerate his ""jokes"" any longer. He can chose between his marriage or his jokes. 

If you otherwise do have a good relationship, and he does not exhibit other controlling behaviors, the complete lack of response from you when he starts this may be helpful. However, try to remember that a normal heathy marriage does not include insults, name calling, you pleading for your husband to stop violating your boundaries, and a refusal to compromise. Check out love is respect . Org (can't link in this sub). "
"Same. I think it's f'ing sick that he did this for 2 weeks. 2 WEEKS!? like, this was not a one off prank. How long would he have kept it up? Who did he think it would be funny for, since obviously not you, OP? 

I wouldn't do that to my worst enemy, it's too vile. "
"tell her you can not bear to have him around any longer and since she refuses to recognize that he is harassing you both in your home, she has to make choice: either she tells him he can't come around any more or she moves out.

you don't want to throw her out because she is a 'good friend' but a good friend would not BLAME her friends for her BF's inappropriate behavior and would not allow it to continue. if she wants to date someone that's an asshole, ten that's her problem. it shouldn't (and doesn't) have to be yours."
"Wow. The fact that you are going through cancer treatment and ill and he literally can't stop himself from groping you against your wishes is monumentally disturbing. I genuinely don't care how sweet he's been in the past or how supportive.  The truth is, this is the first time you've ever denied him what he wanted.  

Massively, MASSIVELY entitled asshole behavior here.  Unbelievably so.  He didn't ""stick around through cancer"".  He's not a great guy because he didn't leave you when you were ill if your illness never really cost him anything. Now it's costing him something.

NOW you see what he's really made of. "
"No way! You'll be *super* glad to have it once you get to college, as well. You ever been inside of a dorm, girl? 😉"
"You *HAVE* to put your son first here. You are doing your best to be a good Dad, and your wife is trying to nuke her relationship with him because he isn't the perfect child in her mind.

Honestly, this SHOULD be a deal breaker. Go to pflag's website and get some resources for dealing with this.

Tell your son that you love him, and that his sexuality is not related to his value as a person or as your son. "
"I'm so sorry for your loss. I feel like I'm in the numb stage as you described right now. There have been a few times that I've been crying/profoundly sad, but most of the time it's been like my emotions are all gone."
"Why won't your boyfriend get his own card? If it's because he can't afford it, think about that. He's willing to risk your prescription and possibly getting you into legal trouble over what, a couple hundred bucks at most? That's really low. Someone who truly loved and respected you would think you're worth more than that, especially over something as trivial as weed. "
"I think you just have to communicate like an adult to him.  ""Hey, BF, I know you hit it off with Sophia, I just want to make it clear that I like where we are and I want you to be careful re: her motives.""  "

"is it possible you could lend your cats to the OP  and your cats could take him under their wing and mentor the boyfriend a bit ?

like you know show him the ropes and stuff…"
"First of all, you need to be very clear that he's is not to make plans for you without asking you first, especially when they involve a lot of commitment concerning time or money.  Period.  If he buys concert tickets to a band you don't want to see and didn't ask you, you should not be obligated to go, for example.  He should be able to go without you and not have it be a big deal.  

Secondly, like you said, his friends are extremely important to him and that's fine, but he needs to understand that you just aren't as close with them and don't have much in common with them.  Just like he's not close with yours and doesn't have much in common with them.  He needs to be able to see this from your POV.  I think it's completely reasonable to not want to hang out with his friends all the time, especially if there are other things you would rather do.  Sometimes, fine, but multiple times a week is kind of a lot of time to spend with people you don't enjoy that much.  

I think the main problem is that he does want you to be as close with his friends as he is, but that's not really realistic.  He can't force closeness, which it seems like he is trying to.  "
"Yeah...  We're in the same boat.  It's scary as hell,  but you can do it.  I'm 33 and was married for 10 yrs. We got divorced last Sept.  7 yrs ago he had a full affair with a gal who was married to his high school friend,  and she KNEW we were married.  We managed to work through it,  but then last year he fell on love with a student of his so I said enough is enough.  He didn't want to physically cheat again.  

It's the lies that sting the most.  The omissions,  the blatant disregard, or in your case finding out you were the ""mean ex wife"" of his story to her.  It's manipulative and most irksome is that he turned to her during a temporary stressful time for you.  

At least she told you,  because he certainly wasn't ever going to.  

If you want to legitimately work on it,  then do so.  It'll take a lot of work and time.  But don't just stay because you fear how life may be...  After almost a year renting a place,  a new, wonderful relationship which unfortunately didn't last,  and processing the divorce,  I just bought my own place.  I've remodeled and am making it mine.  I'm by myself for the first time in 16 years and it's been an adjustment.  It's depressing some days and exciting on others.  I'm not afraid,  though.  It'll be OK for you,  too.  "
"&gt; And my husband thinks I should still come to these hangouts (almost weekly) with spouses because it is awkward if I don't. 

your husband and his friends are the ones who made this awkward. this is on him and them. too bad if their own actions are not causing them 'problems'"
"Did anyone really know that she was treating you like this your whole life? From your own comment she is sugary sweet and then administers little doses of poison. You as the victim build up a tolerance so you don't even notice you're being abused. It's just normal to you.

You won't know if she's doing it to your kid because she's an expert at hiding it and desensitizing her victims to her abuse."
Start making videos of her life so you can see and hear her again. I wish I could have done that with my lost loved ones.
"Well for starters, your brother sounds like a real piece of work. He was definitely abusive to you when you were children, and it seems he still enjoys (and knows how to) pushing your buttons and being an asshole to you for his own amusement and petty reasons.

That being said, I'm concerned that you don't seem to be very in control of your own anger. The fact that you feel as if you can't help but physically harm your brother as a response to him being a tool is unsettling. Do you often get physical when you get angry? This sounds like a serious anger management issue, and like your brother in particular is a big trigger for your anger problem.

Don't hit people. Ever. The only time that should even be an option is if you have to defend yourself from assault, and then that should only be to get away.

If you *truly* can't control yourself then you cannot go. Period. You can't hit another person just because they're an asshole. I would strongly recommend seeking therapy to work on anger management to deal with these emotions: one day you could be charged with assault, or be hospitalized/killed by fighting the wrong person at the wrong time. What happens if you haul off and hit your brother while you're all drunk at some club during the party? Then the bouncer comes over and intervenes and you try to fight the bouncer/random people because you're drunk and seeing red? That's a recipe for jail and checking the felony box on job applications for the rest of your life. Get a handle on your anger and violent impulses before it causes you or someone else irreparable harm."
"That's a really odd thing to say. 3 years is definitely not ""haven't known them for long"" territory. It also doesn't make sense to qualify such a basic statement as ""I know how much this day means to her."" One does not need to know a bride very long to know how much her wedding day means to her. It's kind of a no-brainer.

Go ahead and say something. You're the MOH so it's not inappropriate for you to give instructions to the other bridesmaids - in fact it's your job."
"My dad started dating my moms best friend two months after she died. They told everyone in the family except me, presumably because they knew it would be hard for me. My dad let the cat out of the bag on Christmas night, saying ""well I guess I should let you know Kathy and I are dating now. And we are going out to dinner right now."" That was literally it and then he left. I was in my younger twenties and was shocked and sad and quickly realized that my brother and sister had known for months, so I was alone with these emotions. No one left me any room to feel anything; I was immediately labeled as hating Kathy even though I said over and over that I didn't I just hated how they had dealt with everything. The subsequent years of my life were so difficult. A lot of therapy was had but my dad just passed a few weeks ago now and through his sickness and his death I had to hear how Kathy was 'scared' of me and she would leave the hospital or our house every time I showed up. At this point, I've come to dislike her. 

All that to say I am really glad for your daughter and for you and your partner that you've reached out, listened to advice, and put your love before your fears. It's so hard for everyone dealing with loss and how to move on, but figuring out how to be open and give each other space and communicate love is the way to figure it out. "
"Also contact lgbtq personalities/activists.  I don't have a lot of names off the top of my head, but I know Dan Savage has personally interceded in these cases before.  There aren't that many pray the gay camps and any long-time activist will be able to tell you where she's most likely to be based on where your parents live.  And direct you to sympathetic Pro Bono lawyers with experience extricating kids from these places."
"Wait until he explains himself and if it sounds like bullshit, you can still go through with your plan.

Honestly it doesn't look good, but give him a chance. Again, you sound prepared to leave which is good. It may still come down to that. But at least hear what he has to say, and be prepared for the worst.

Wish this were better news or circumstances, but you sound reasonably prepared. Sounds like you're already staying strong for yourself and the baby. Good luck."
"I actually feel the worst for Carol in this situation, I think. This isn't a new issue for her. She has spent years dealing with it. She's spent years trying to have a relationship with you, but having to deal with your best friend bringing up your ex, talking about how amazing your ex is, constant updates on her. He made it clear he didn't like Carol, made her feel unwelcome, made your entire relationship about Rachel. And now he's trying to use his death to drive you towards your ex. It's weird and manipulative. It's like he's kept you on the hook for her all this time, it's been almost a decade since you spoke to Rachel but her shadow still hangs heavily over your life through your friend. 

I normally wouldn't say this, but your friend will be dead. He's not going to be affected by the consequences of this request. You, Carol, and Rachel will be. It's not fair to ANY of you for him to be doing this. 

I'm wondering, has your rockiness with Carol coincided with times you were spending more times with your friend, and hearing more about Rachel? She seems (rightfully) resentful that this ex from so long ago that you don't even speak to seems to have so much weight in your life. In her position, I wouldn't want you speaking to her either. It seems like a recipe for disaster. 

You say you don't think you're going to fall into bed and run off to happily ever after but that's clearly what your friend thinks ought to happen. He doesn't want you with Carol, he's made that clear for years. She's stayed with you through all of this and now her request is that you *don't* go drinking with your ex-on-a-pedestal while you're emotionally vulnerable? I don't think that's unreasonable at all. 

Worry about the people who are still going to be living after this is over. "
Literally every woman who has looked at this post has met some form of this guy. We know what we're talking about. Trust women and stop making excuses for this dude. 
"Here's my big question.  I assume due to your erratic schedule you're working at time when he's off work.

What does he do for you during his days off?"
"I will tell you my story, OP.

I was 16 when my first boyfriend raped me and severely beat me up.  I didn't tell anyone because he threatened to kill me if I did, and after what he had just done, I believed him.  I didn't tell anyone for 5 years.  I spiraled in to severe depression, got kicked out, drank and smoked weed a lot, while still managing to go to school and work a job.  I tried to kill myself twice.  My boyfriends were ok guys, but not great, and I bounced from guy to guy.  At 26, I met who I thought was a great guy, and after 2 years we got engaged.  I lost my job during that time after a serious car accident, and was left with chronic pain and migraine disorder.  After we got engaged, he became abusive within one week and I left him two months before our wedding.

After that, I felt that no-one would ever want someone with my degree of baggage and damage, so I stayed single.  I decided I wanted to get healthy, though, and got in to counselling.  I was in therapy for 3 years, working hard on learning to manage my depression and heal from my past.  Then I chose to go back to school in my 30's, intending to advance my career and live the life I wanted as a single person.

At school, I met my fiance.  He is entirely different from anyone else I've dated and he loves me, past issues and all.  He helps me with my chronic pain, loves me even if I have a down time with depression, and constantly lifts me up.  I would never have found him if I didn't' spend all that time working on myself.  And if I had never found him, I would have been a healthy and happier version of myself, capable of being ok with being alone.

Please leave this horrible abuser.  Take your bosses offer, and accept help wherever you can find it, from people you trust.  Invest in counseling, work on yourself, and take time to heal.  I was 8 years older than you are before I met my man, so you have plenty of time.  Be kind to yourself, first and foremost."
"I think this may have been your aunt's way of expressing her support for your mental health journey. It also gives you the power of paying for the therapist - maybe for a session you don't want to tell your parents about, or if your parents decide to discontinue paying."
"You didn't screw up anything.  You were at a stage in the relationship where you needed clarity on your status, so you asked for it.  And she gave you an answer.

The problem is that you don't want to hear the answer.  But you got just what you needed.  Move on."
"I would move slowly and cautiously and establish a relationship with your sister first.  Then, perhaps, other siblings.

Unfortunately, it sounds as though your father is abusive and your mother is his enabler.  I would be very hesitant to allow her to have contact with you and your partner."
"&gt;A few months ago, his dad blatantly called me fat in front of the family. He never calls anyone fat, and it wasn't in humour. It crushed my self esteem for weeks.

HOLY LORD! 
WHY ARE YOU TAKING THIS?! Why are you with this man?! 

Dear, you need a partner that uplifts you! Someone that will have your back when such attacks to you as a person happen. 

THIS GUY IS FAILURE AS A PARTNER. 

The petty in me would have told him I am too freaking fat to help his family move. F that people. "
"Leave her. Your girlfriend is either so incredibly stupid that she thought her actions were okay, or she was trying to fuck her students and cover it up. Either way, you don't need to deal with this mess or this woman ever again. 

I also believe there is zero chance that she was unaware that her actions were unacceptable. They drill that into every teacher's head numerous times, that they should not be interacting with students like that."
"I wouldn't even be thinking of her cheating. It's almost certainly from her, HSV 1 readily transfers to the genitals. Based on her personality I would wait till you have the type confirmed before telling her. Although that does point to a continuing weakness in the trust and communication in your relationship."
"This:

&gt; My boyfriend of 9 years cheated on me with his coworker while i was grieving the death of my grandmother.the affair lasted more than 5 months but he was looking for fun online too before he decided to cheat on me with coworker.

Is something you need to read again. He cheated on you for months while you were grieving the death of a family member, and BEFORE he did that he was looking for fun online. Clearly this guy isnt relationship material. How can you ever trust him again?

Cheating is wrong in ANY case, but what he did wasnt just a stupid drunken mistake, no, he had an ongoing affair.

Cut your losses, find someone who loves you and respects you, because this guy clearly doesnt. Dont stay with him because you love him and its more comfortable than breaking up. Love should be mutual, and his actions show that it's onesided."
"Please CANCEL this . Girl. Your ""best friend"" has no intentions to pay you back on time if at all."
"As others have said...with your sister you need to be cautiously optimistic.  The operative word being cautious.  She's still in contact with her parents and could be feeding them info about you.  It could even be coming from a ""good place"" like trying to reconcile family differences.  But you need to place clear expectations and boundaries with your sister.  It's not your place to say she has to end contact with her parents but it is a totally reasonable boundary to tell her ""do NOT feed the parents any information about my life"".  And be careful with what information you give your sister (even if you think she's not relaying it to the parents) because, while she seems genuine, she hasn't earned your trust back yet."
"If you never tell him your true feelings and how your resentment is building up, it's more likely that when you have this discussion you're going to be close to a breaking point instead of being able to talk about it calmly.

""We've talked about marriage for many years now, but nothing has been done about it. When we talked about a proposal you said you wanted to handle that. Do you want to get married to me? Do you have hesitations? Marriage is important to me because of x,y,z. (If you want kids, talk about that here)."" Then see what his response is. Maybe he just didn't know how big of a deal it is for you. But if you talk about it and it still doesn't happen..

It's been seven years. If he can't give you concrete answers about what he's waiting for, he probably doesn't want to get married to you.  When you love and care about someone it's not hard to do something to make them happy. "
Do you like this life? Is this what you thought marriage would be like?
"You didn't get him in trouble.  He was assaulting you.  Not only is that wrong, it's a crime.  

And if your mom hadn't been there, what would have happened?  Would he have stopped?  Would he have gone further?  You say he wasn't trying to hurt you, but he certainly wasn't trying *not* to hurt you.  He wasn't thinking about you at all.  

I think you need to get away from this guy.  He isn't safe.  He doesn't respect you or your boundaries.  A good guy would never do something like that.  The fact that he has the gall to be pissed at you is enough of a reason to dump his ass.  "
"Next time she mentions it, (I assume she does it in a joking manner) ""Joke"" back.  

Mom:  MomExpectsHelp is going to be supporting me when I'm all out.

MomExpectsHelp:  Ha!  Ha!  Funny.  Sorry Mom, I won't be able to help you out.   I spent it all on bobble head collectables.  I expect that investment to pan out really well in 20 years.

(or something as equally as silly)

Match your level of seriousness with hers, and always the answer is ""no""

Mom:  ""What?  You wouldn't help me out if I was destitute?

MomExpectsHelp: You got 5 million dollars.  That is not what I define as destitute.

Mom:  But I don't have it anymore!!!

MomExpectsHelp: Wow.  You'd better start making arrangements.  Try downsizing.

Mom:""You'd let me starve??""

MomExpectsHelp: You'd let yourself starve by not taking care of your money, you mean.  Mom, don't let yourself starve.  That's very unwise.


You get the idea.  Always put the responsibility back on her.
Be careful, some states have laws where the state can sue a child for an indigent parent's upkeep.

Google ""filial laws""  and protect yourself.

"This.

I was at a wedding where the best man tried to ""wing"" the speech, wound up getting verbal diarrhea, and completely embarrassing himself and the groom. It's never a bad idea to be prepared ahead of time."
"Be stern &amp; firm and indicate that if she does it again, she can't come over or only come over in the company of your wife.

Given the possible negative consequences to you as a married man and legally with a minor, you must be pristine in your conduct or woe is you if things go south. 

Now, if you now any young men that could distract her that might be a good thing.

This guy should never reproduce or be in any remotely influential position in regards to children.  I'd be hard pressed to recall any post on this sub where someone was more of an entitled loser than OPs husband. 
"&gt; she said that they will just pay me at the hotel at the end of the trip

*That is not acceptable to me. You promised to pay me back right away. We are not going on any trip that my costs aren't covered upfront, especially as I want some money to play with on my birthday*

I really think you're being conned and you won't see your money unless she wins the lottery."
"Christ this relationship sounds exhausting.

You're a coward and she expects you to read her mind. Neither of you seems to particularly *like* the other, you're just forcing things because...I dunno, you think she's really hot? Her friends are pressuring her? I have no idea. 

It hasn't even been a year yet and you're already fighting more than you're not-fighting. You sure you actually want to be with this girl?"
"My guess is there is a worry about whether her fiancé will cheat on her. She says he has changed but there is still that worry there so OP is looking consciously or subconsciously for a reason why he cheated on his ex and a part of her is wondering ""if he could cheat on someone kinder, smarter, prettier then will he do it to me?""."
"Never tell an employer you might be leaving as another job might not materialize and then the dynamics of the situation at your job will have changed since they know you are planning on leaving. Instead after you get this other job, give your employer more than two weeks notice if you want and negotiate the start date with the other employer. "
"Yeah, while on paper it sounds like Carol is the mean one but honestly I don't blame her for being resentful. Even OP admits he's putting a lot of time, effort and money into Sam, a person who's trying to break them up. Even on his funeral bed Sam is still plotting the breakup like *wow*. It would have be best if OP had broken up with carol a long time ago because he doesn't sound all the invested. It would be far kinder to everyone involved."
"This is so lovely! Congratulations! I'm really happy to see that you were able to turn this situation around, and learn more about yourself in the process."
"It's over. LDR is hard and she made her decision - twice. Take the loss, cry about it, go get drunk tonight, but you're going to have to respect her decision. "
Thank you for making this distinction! Turning down an extra shift is much different than taking off a scheduled shift. Don't feel bad OP. You did nothing wrong. 
Just to be clear: Saying 'I don't wanna talk to you' to mean 'I do wanna talk to you' and ignoring phone calls because you want the other person to repeatedly call back until you pick up is NOT a part of Chinese culture; it's just fucking insane.
"I think this is obviously due to your extremely low self esteem. Stop comparing yourself to her. That's the best way to drive yourself insane and keep yourself feeling low. 

The only info you've gotten of her is from social media and random tidbits from your fiancé. You don't have the complete picture here. All you see is thin, pretty, and smart. 

I know plenty of thin, pretty, smart people who are fucking assholes. I feel like your fiancé won't bad mouth his ex because it's in really bad taste for the ""sinner"" to do so. 

So stop trying comparing yourself to her. Your low self esteem is probably what is making you feel like your fiancé is comparing the two of you. Your irrational thoughts have clouded your judgement. She's not in the picture. She probably won't ever be back in the picture. Some shitty stuff happened years ago between the two of them, they have moved on and YOU need to do the same. "
"This.  He is showing signs of extreme, irrational jealousy."
"I have some savings put aside which I could use to get away from her with my son (If he wishes to join me, of course) , but it is not much as my wife goes over our bank accounts.

"NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!

YES, you can. She is a selfish POS that is damaging and shitting on everyone in her life.

"It's helpful to let the person who will be working the most out of the house to have some sleep during the night, but the stay at home parent definitely needs some rest, too.  I tried to handle all of the nighttime feedings, etc., when my son was born, and I damn near went insane from the constant sleep disruptions.  So my husband and I got creative with dividing the work.  I would get up during the night, yes, but he handled baby duties before he went to bed, and before he left for work.  We also took turns with making dinner, and swapped off sleeping in on weekends-he had Saturdays, I had Sundays.  So there are ways to make things more equitable without causing WWIII.  

That being said, I think he's being a weenie right now, and hopefully will be more receptive to further discussion.  It's fine to object to things, but shutting down the convo completely isn't cool."

"If she doesn't **want** to stop emotionally cheating on you and disrespecting you in front of everyone she works with, then you know where her priorities are. "
"Dude!! 
This isn't about you. This is about her. She is telling you, straight up, that she needs you to be more engaged in her life.
Introvert or not, you need to step up. You have to do things that make you uncomfortable for HER sake, it's not all about you.
She asked you to go out with her and an old friend who is a guy? You should have gone and told stories about hoe great she is and how you gouts met and all that kind of thing. 
Instead, you left her HANGING!
You better apologize for that because you didn't have her back at all and basically that is your job!
Being an introvert doesn't mean you never interact with people, it just means that it is really hard and the success of the interaction may be in question. 
Being a partner means you do it anyway to the best of your ability. Every. Single. Time."
"It sounds like she's jet lagged from jumping time zones. 

Try not to be a dick about it."
"I know an 83 year old man that did this with every K.D. Lang song he found on YouTube. He got the internet because someone told him he could hear K.D. Lang songs after he heard one on public radio and he thought she sounded like an angel.

I helped him set up his internet. The AT&amp;T rep was a fucking champ. He would say almost nothing more than ""yes, I want internet"" and ""talk to her"", because the rest of it was gibberish to him. I think she got special managerial permission at some point to approve the sale because he couldn't verbally consent to enough of it himself. He was all there, he just was from the backwoods in KY, never had a TV, and still hasn't graduated from cassette tapes to CD's. Computers and the internet are magic to him.

He once told me that someone told him that K.D. Lang ""dated the women more than the men"" and he told them to shut up or get out of his house because his sister had dated ""everything with legs"" from the 60s to the 80s. I was an 18-year-old in the closet lesbian with extremely intolerant parents at the time, and it was actually really affirming to hear a sweet 83 year old man blew up at some middle aged homophobic acquaintance just for casually *insinuating* there was something wrong with her for dating women.

I've tried so hard to even make him realize he can listen to *anything* on YouTube and do so much more with the internet. But he was already happy with everything else in his life, he just wanted to be able to listen to any ""new"" K.D. Lang songs.

Goddamn that's so zen or Buddhist or shit. "
"I mean. Three years of long distance? Seems like it's perfectly fair and understandable to break up. Neither of you knew whether this drastic time apart that would've been exciting and new for her would've been totally life-changing to her. It could have ended very very messily. 

But she broke up. She gets no free pass to get back together with you, especially if you were resentful about the whole experience. You've moved on, that was part of the sacrifice she made to make those three years more comfortable and wonderful for her. Great, now she should take everything she learned in your relationship and over those 3 years into her new life back home and with any new guys. She is acting entitled and not caring about your feelings at all to try and just ""resume"" after she ended things.

Tell everyone you've moved on. She had her chance and she put her three years away above you - that's fine, she's allowed to think those were really important for her, but that also means she gave up what she had with you and doesn't get it back."
"Your BF is doing this girl a disservice by not dealing with this. 

Part of an internship is learning what is and isn't acceptable in a working environment, and that includes learning what dress is acceptable (literally had to go clothes shopping earlier this summer since I started an internship and needed appropriate clothes).

She's an intern, and his responsibility. He needs to address this. "
"Be glad it's over.

If he contacts you again, do not try to defend these texts, simply say ""After the way you behaved, I am glad it's over. I want nothing more to do with you."" Then block."
She is not mature enough to be married.
"You're an adult, I have an idea that may piss her off but she won't be able to complain without sounding crazy. 

Buy a free standing wardrobe or armoire or something of the sort. Put all of your clothes in it and lock it with a padlock (you can get storage things from IKEA and loop a chain through the handles and lock it for super cheap). 

Then, buy a locking tackle box for your makeup. Or a cute bin and lock it up. 

Put anything you don't want her to take in a lock box. 

Your mom is infantizing you and verbally abusing you. This is abusive behavior and stems much deeper than just clothes and makeup. She's jealous and abusing you. Point blank. Abuse. She is abusive. 

Work on moving out, you're worth more than someone who donates your things when she feels like being a megabitch "
"You're shooting the messenger.

I mean, I don't know you or what your counselling has been like and I don't know what your relationship is like, but you say that things have been escalating **lately** which could have tipped something that was borderline two months ago into the abusive category recently (and ""Your partner is abusive, I am not optimistic that counselling will work and you need to GTFO"" is not exactly something you deliver over the phone or when you're in the session with your partner)."
"Your comments are rather reactionary and defensive. Are you sure you aren't, ""asking for a friend?"""
"Try again to reason out with your partner that Cat#2 would be happier in a single cat home where she can have much more affection than you can give her and he doesn't have the time to give her.

Make it plain and clear to him that he is in no way caring for the cat when he doesn't even take the responsibility to feed her or clean her box. 

"
"Honestly, if my husband told me after dinner that he absolutely needed to leave the house now &amp; buy conditioner before we could proceed with watching our planned movie, I would probably also be confused. Why does this errand need to happen right now, in the middle of date night? Why do we need conditioner before we can watch a movie? And if this absolutely needs to happen in the middle of date night (time we planned to spend together), why do you need to go without me? And why do I need to stay home &amp; clean up for our joint dinner while you do it? 

If you had presented this as, ""Hey, I'm feeling super overwhelmed, &amp; I just need to take a few minutes to myself before we watch the movie"" I would not have any of those questions &amp; would understand what you needed. But since you presented it as a dire need to purchase conditioner at this exact moment, I could see how this escalated. "
"Words *are* cheap, aren't they?

He's probably just mean with his money when it comes to spending it on other people. Way the simplest explanation.

(Also: ""$50-200 per paycheck on MTG "" - perleeze... come on, you wanna date *that*? If he can afford that, he has disposible income enough to buy you a fucking chessboard, he just doesn't want to. You are making way too many excuses for him here)"
"Most of my friends have babies now, and when a baby bumps themselves on something, they take a moment to look around before they start wailing, and the volume and intensity always depend on how worried/concerned their nearest parent looks. If they immediately rush over, it increases tenfold. Four times out of five, if my friends watch them disinterestedly for a few seconds to determine if it's a serious injury, the baby stops crying immediately."
"I think you are overreacting. To your points:

- DINKs = not offensive. It's descriptive. And why would it be a dig at his own wife for being a SAHM? Even if she personally had an income, they still wouldn't be DINKs, because they have kids. 

- It's nice of you to think of other people's children and want to get them gifts. The message Jay sent you could be implying that you are spoiling his kid, or it could be a joke. Tone is tough in text and you are reading more into it than is there. Of course, it is actually within his rights to ask you not to come bearing gifts every time, if he doesn't want his child to think that he gets treats every time he sees you.

- OK. I get that ""you'll understand when you have kids"" is annoying. I certainly get that. But... so? Why exactly did this stand out from all the other ""preachy"" comments you said Jay made on the trip? If this is the best example you could offer up, you are reaching.

- What explanation do you need here? Jay told you what you did wrong. You called his child a name (to his face or not). I don't know why you'd frame it as him being a brat when you knew the problem - he wanted the potty and thought you were taking him away from it. It's not bratty to feel upset someone is preventing you from peeing when you really need to go.
 
- Yeah, it's annoying Jay wanted to one-up your accomplishment with childbirth. He was probably looking to score some points with Christy by acknowledging what a hard thing she did. Was it cool thing to do, socially? No, but like, on a scale of 1 to 10 of social gaffes this is like a 2.

I don't even know how you would bring this up tactfully with Jay and Christie. If these are your best examples, you've got no case to bring to them that will show them the light. You're going to have to live with it, speak up in the moment, change the subject, walk away... whatever you need to do to make it stop annoying you so much, just like when a friend gets into Crossfit/gets a new puppy/went on an amazing trip/whatever and won't stop mentioning it."
"So the first thing is that a child *never* disappears. 

The second thing is that the child being of similar complexion doesn't mean it's yours. It sounds like you had safe sex so you shouldn't take her word for it. She herself doesn't even know unless there's a paternity test completed. 

The third thing is that you need to tell your parents and get some serious legal advice. It's easy for her to say she's not going to come for child support when she's presumably living on that comfy dual income with her boyfriend. Just be aware that unless you get something in writing, there's no way to guarantee that she can't take you to court at any given moment."

"Throwing your ring out the window and calling you a spoilt brat is not what a loving partner does. Honestly I would leave for that kind of behaviour. It's not about the ring but about the effort and feelings behind it. If you want to stay with him, there needs to be counseling and a discussion about expectations. He obviously misinterpreted what you meant about the cost of the ring and even though he was angry he shouldn't have done that."
"&gt; that she's so sorry and that my father made her do it, but she's still with him

Don't forget that.

Sorry means *nothing* without an attempt to change. Not one single, gotdamn thing."
"At first, I thought maybe the co-workers were just being office busybodies....I thought everything was probably okay until I got to these points:

&gt;Despite all this she was crying and **admitted to having a crush on him** which didn’t exactly make me happy. She also admitted **Jim and his wife’s marriage has been rough for a long time** and **he confided in her for advice**. 


RED FLAGS.

She needs to admit to herself how she's really feeling because she is genuinely playing with fire. "
"&gt;I haven't yet had a chance to talk to him about this because they all went out to the bar. I want to bring it up when he gets back and need some advice about what to say. I really don't want to be one of those wives who's controlling of her husband's guy time or who he's friends with. 

OP... what the hell? What kind of terrible shit has he pulled on you over the years that you seem, like, moderately perturbed instead of RAGINGLY PISSED about this? If my husband did that to me I don't care who was in the room I would be absolutely flipping out. What did you even do when he told you? How was he able to leave to go to the bar with his bros instead of getting his ass handed to him? This is not a ""controlling wife"" scenario. Where is your self-respect?"
Get a lawyer and start the divorce process. You will not go with nothing. The lawyers and courts will make sure that you get your half of the assets from the marriage and that your husband will meet his minimum legal responsibility for the child.
"""Something he could never have"" - your virginity? This is super fucked up TBH and would be an immediate dealbreaker if I were you??? You don't need to grovel at his feet for being dirtied by another man before he got to soil you himself, jesus. He didn't talk to you about his past relationships, either; why are you in the wrong for not announcing it?

My advice is to text him:

""I am assuming you're upset because you've learned I'm not a virgin or I've dated before, I don't know. If you want to actually have a conversation about this, please call me or arrange to meet me in person. I will not be treated like garbage just because I have dated before, and that is what you are doing by giving me the cold shoulder like this. If you don't respond to me and have a mature conversation with me about whatever the issue is, I am assuming we're done.""

Then, follow through. If he doesn't respond with a day, then assume you are done AND ACTUALLY MOVE ON. Leave him, and find someone who isn't obsessed with female virginity. You have done literally nothing wrong at all, and should not be excusing someone who deals with an emotional surprise by ghosting you. It would be one thing if he was taken aback because of his assumptions and had to adjust how he perceived things AND TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IT, but he ghosted you. I'm shocked you've listed him as 22 and not 15. Honestly, he needs to grow the fuck up -- and you need to have more respect for yourself than to grovel for someone who (1) is THIS upset that you aren't a virgin, WTF -- even if it's about 'not knowing,' you BOTH didn't talk about your pasts; and (2) who deals with emotional situations by giving you the cold shoulder for days. A healthy person who needs space might say ""I need a day or two to myself to think about things. Feel free to check in. Maybe we can talk on Weds?"" or whatever."
"Relationship ending. She sees you as a meal ticket, not a partner. Get out now."
"&gt; He was telling me the women that I am going with are ""damaged""

Yeah I do."
"All of this.

OP you aren't overreacting and that post is exactly what you should do. Don't ever be alone with him from now on. This guy's bad news."
"How on earth do you expect someone with such a huge anger problem to be able to handle a 'peaceful' separation?!

*The dude can't even handle driving or sailing a boat in a peaceful fashion.* He sure as hell can't handle a divorce in a peaceful fashion. I think you're being overly optimistic and that's dangerous. Plan for the worst, hope for the best. "
"&gt;  I already gave him everything I had; the only thing I have left is my self respect, and he can't have it.

This sentence alone tells me you **will** be okay. I know you will. You just need to believe it too.

Someone else here had a great idea of making short term goals, which is fantastic. Focus on your own happiness. Far too long, you put this bonehead before you, and you owe it to yourself to take care of yourself too. 

I'm rooting for you"
"I think I am realizing that Rachel isn't the catalyst here. It's my relationship with Carol that needs work. I have long considered ending my marriage, but I wanted some outside perspective because I didn't want to do what some people I have known have done. They get a shitty diagnosis and they dump their wife and just go off the deep end. "
"As kids we look up to our parents a whole lot, but part of becoming an adult is learning that they're human too. It's usually a harsh lesson."
"I went to one of those places. You need to find your sister. Kids are beaten, left to die, starved, you name it. There were 14 students at my program with me and I am one of the final five. The rest have all committed suicide or OD'ed. You need to contact a lawyer and find your sister. If I were you, I'd try to get custody until she's 18.

I don't know where she is, she could have gotten lucky and wound up at one of the gentler places where all they are doing is shaming her. That's the best case scenario. Other... Well....

Go check out r/troubledteen they might be able to help you. 

Also, this isn't your fault. You got played. Your parents are monsters. I wish you both the best of luck."
"You, much like my fiancée, have a special ability to make a gift-giving occasion something truly magnificent. This gift is something of quality, nostalgia, and kindness. It isn't something expensive you bought because it was convenient. You put time, effort, and interest in it. It's an activity the two of you can share. Your girlfriend should feel overwhelmed with how lucky she is to have you, not creeped out that you actually listen to her and value her.

It would be weird if you just met, but relax! You've been together for almost a year. Moving in is looming in your future. This isn't casual and I can't stress enough how important listening is in a relationship, and boy do have that shit LOCKED.

Good luck and best wishes to both of you!"
"Welcome to adulthood without kids, this is pretty much how it works.

To be honest, nothing you've described sounds terribly egregious. Since you asked, I do think you're overreacting. "
"I think it's time to start standing up against this situation. 

However as there is a young child involved, I do think it's only fair to give them a reasonable notice period that they have to find their own accommodation. 

If your girlfriend won't help you with this, then I think you need to think carefully about your relationship with her. She is really the point of failure here. She should be making them support themselves, not capitulating. "
"It's shitty. It also makes sense that men who would agree to marry wives in the situation that they did would be more ok with sideline G you and losing your friendship, because somewhere down deep they intrinsically believe men and women are different and your friendship is less important than your husband's friendship, and even their wives feelings about you continuing to hang with the boys. You are right to feel hurt and surprised by how the double standard is now being applied to you. The boys comfort was most important to your husband when he married you and wanted them to not feel disrupted, it wasn't that he wanted you to hang with them so badly hat he made waves to integrate you into the group. It was just coincidence that you integrated well into their group so it made it feel inclusive when it was really just about the boys being more important than girls. Otherwise he would have spent more time away from you and with them. Now it's unfortunate for him that his priorities are showing again but this time it's not an accidental benefit to you... the boys comfort is once again the most important thing even over your happiness and comfort. Your husband, even though you have a love marriage, still agrees with the boys being more important than yours. He won't allow you to even state your feelings to your friends for fear of making them uncomfortable. That's sad. You have autonomy and can do what you want. He certainly does what he wants without concern for your hurt feelings. I think you should tell them how hurt you are by their double standard and choice to forgo being friends with you and relegate you to a lesser place in their group because they chose to marry conservative women. Then tell them you'll be polite and hang at some large group hangs, but you're going to make a choice to separate yourself and make real friends who won't drop you because its easier to drop you than explain to their wife that you actually like hanging out at the bar or seeing that movie. Be honest and be fierce and then go find some other friends who are fierce like you. Volunteer, use meetup.com, join a gym or yoga studio, join an athletic league, etc. Sorry girl, the patriarchy SUCKS sometimes. "
"If this stems from his dislike of Carol, then it seems such a horribly manipulative thing that I really don't think you should do it. 

If your relationship with Carol is on the rocks, then either fix it or get out. But have the stones to do so alone, don't do it by going after Rachel again. "
"Cons:  
- She puts you down constantly  
- Sex is meh already 8 months in   
- She obviously doesn't even really like you   

Pros:  
- she's hot.  


Dude. Grow up, and find someone actually nice and caring. "

"Your mom effectively stole from your dad, and you. Asking you if she could borrow money from that account when you were A CHILD is pretty disgusting behavior - she needed to speak to your dad about the money in that account, not you. Not to mention, she didn't need it for any legitimate reason, i.e. emergency medical costs, disaster, etc. She just wanted the money to bankroll a lifestyle she couldn't afford. I'm sorry to come down so hard on your mom, I know you love her, but I want to be clear that what she did was not okay.

Speak with your dad immediately, he needs to know what's going on so he can try to protect whatever is left of that account for you, and deal with your mom and the possibility of repayment. Unfortunately, if the account is solely in her name, you and your dad likely have no legal recourse at this point.

Best of luck!"
"Do not do joint custody of the dog. You will be allowing your abuser to have contact with you going forward. The dog will be fine. It will be more stressful for the dog to have people in and out of it's routine.

You have to cut out of an abusive relationship 100%. If he wants the truck, let him buy it from you. He has used your love and emotions against you for a long time. I hate to be harsh, but martyring yourself as this ends **does not help you.** It is time to put yourself first."

"Dude wanted a kid to work out if he wanted kids. What was going to happen to this kid if he decided he didn't want kids? He's over 30 and you don't need that level of stupidity and wavering commitment in your life. Nothing worthwhile's going to come out of confronting him IMO, like what an he honestly say that'll leave you satisfied? I'd just go no contact and say good riddance tbh."
"Nahh, his family is fucking ridiculous. 

It'd be one thing if they'd had you over a few days prior for the express purpose of helping them pack, but how the hell are they not 95% packed if they have to move *that day*? I'm moving in a couple of weeks and have already started packing and organising, so that's unfathomable to me.

It does sound like you both could have communicated better, but hindsight's 20/20. It would have been good if you'd pulled him aside and said ""Look, I was expecting them to be more or less ready to go and I don't see the point in hanging around with no clear plan, especially when there's already a bunch of extra people here. I'm going to go see my family. Call me when there's something specific I can do"". Then again, it sounds like he would've taken that badly regardless.

Also, calling you ""worthless"" is horrible, even in anger. 

Have you guys sat down and had a calm conversation about this? Is he often this unreasonable?"
"Why don't you like the idea of compromising by YOU dressing the baby on the days you're around? 

Seriously. You'll both avoid embarrassment AND you'll be more interactive and bonding with the baby, plus giving your wife a little bit of a break. Try it. As opposed to making rules for your wife, which I think is going to annoy her. "
"As someone who has a similar parent, I feel you. This type of overstepping is annoying when it's a one time incident -- but when it has been a pattern your entire life, it really pushes a button.

I think what you have learned is that you need to keep your parents at a distance during the wedding planning. Don't give them the knowledge or access that would allow your dad to do something like this.

Edit: I see that others think you are overreacting. They probably haven't dealt with a lifetime of an intrusive parent getting involved and doing it for you, always as a ""surprise"" so you have no chance to object. (And then making you the asshole for being upset when he was ""just being helpful."") Trust me, I get it."
"&gt;Lacy only wants to invite the BF to her wedding if he cooks for the whole event.

"Usually out of desperation. This guy just sounds off, it's only been two weeks and he's acting like this. I really want to know what his problem was with the stuffed animal. "
"His ex-wife could have been one of those spoiled brat types you're trying to not be. She could have been one of those people who has to have the most expensive ring, the most over-the-top and dramatic proposal. She could have been someone who had to have the giant wedding. How much do you know about their marriage and divorce?

This guy has a lot of baggage with money that very likely stems from his first marriage. You need to ask yourself if you're okay having your expectations managed by someone who isn't even in his life anymore."
"Dude, you genuinely sound like you have a problem. Even hearing things from your point of view makes it sound as though your wife's concerns hold plenty of merit. I noticed themes of grandiosity and obsession in your post which have me questioning your ability to see this situation through a realistic lens. Might be an idea to get some help with that. I hope you're able to sort this one out and keep your relationship strong. "

"I don't even know how to respond to this. I honestly think you must be trolling. This is beyond the pale.

If you're not trolling, then yes, I think you're justified in leaving. Perhaps the end of your relationship will be the jolt your ex needs to grow up."
"Right?! This post is just appalling. OP is still deep within the self-obsession of the addict and can only think of his (many, many) feels rather than the well-being of _the woman he starved_. Reading his self-pity over another guy chatting up _the woman he starved_ was just gross.

He says how awful he feels, but again, he's just wallowing in his emotions to avoid taking actual responsibility and making actual amends. Allie is so well rid of him; I hope she's able to move out soon and talks to a therapist (and a divorce lawyer) about the whole _starving_ thing. Oh, and the pages of bile he ""accidentally"" left out for her to read. Jesus."
"You're not being at all paranoid, given what she confessed to you. Crushes happen. Blowing kisses at a crush or letting him tell you his relationship problems is not appropriate. I doubt she meant to be inappropriate and it is actually quite easy to get too close to a crush without being fully aware of what's going on, so I don't think she needs to feel excessive guilt but she absolutely does need to step back now. In my opinion that doesn't mean ceasing to be his friend but it does mean being careful. Has she agreed to step back a bit?"
"&gt;How should I take it?

That he considers you an equal who is capable of paying her own way in life."
"Two points you made can tell you why she is so pissed:

""She feels unwanted, and like I always choose it over her. It got to the point that I would sneak off to work on it, and lie about how much I was doing it.""
 
&amp;

""I will be the first to admit that in the past I have gone way overboard with this particular hobby. It HAS taken up an unreasonable amount of time, it HAS distracted me from work, and sadly, it HAS taken my attention away from my wife."" 

This is serious red-flag territory. You *are* an addict. Not behaving like one, not likened to one; this is an addiction. Let me frame it in a different light by using your words.

Imagine I am an alcoholic and say to you;
""However, I am extremely passionate about this **beer**, and feel like I should be allowed to have it in my life. If I can have the willpower (which I'm proud of myself for going a whole YEAR without it), I think it's reasonable to be able to **have a few beers**. After work, or on Saturdays, just like anyone would play video games, sports, go fishing, whatever. Just like a normal hobby.""

You weren't able to treat it like a normal hobby when it first started, so what is different now?

You need therapy. You specifically. If you want to try couples therapy, go for it. But this is an unhealthy level of obsession that has affected your work, marriage, and personal happiness, and you absolutely need to see someone about this. "
"&gt; How do I handle this without making him more angry?

Don't bring it up again. Just drop it. You said no (for *very* valid reason). You explained why you said no (again, valid reasons).

His butthurtitis is his business.

If he brings it up again, just repeat your reasons and your answer (no), say, ""I'm sure you'll do a fantastic job."", and change the subject.

If he does this a lot in your relationship, then that's a different discussion."
"¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Someone should ask what his rates would be for a wedding, perhaps then ask for 10% off as mate's rates. It'll probably be enough to stop the conversation!"
"He's a selfish POS who cheated on his wife and *was a coward to his kids* and made his wife tell them he was a cheater. Oh and he *happens* to be gay. 

Honestly? I'd lead with that anytime someone makes a comment. 
""Yes it's been hard on everyone that he just so happens to be gay and oh, that he also cheated on his wife.""
""Yes I'm very happy for him. It's so unfortunate that he felt the need to lie to me and our children and cheat on me, but yes I'm so glad he's found himself.""
""Yes everyone deserves to live a genuine life. So did I.""

You get the gist. If people are going to be callously ignorant, I see no issue in shooting a slightly bitter sarcastic comment their way. 

Fuck those people. You were betrayed, he left you to clean up his mess. "
"Tell your father yesterday. Single parents are a package deal, either she gets over herself or she has to go."
"I'm amazed at all the comments here that accuse you of having no trust. I mean. He's an addict. You know that, he knows that.

So if there was an innocent solution, why didn't he text: 'Need some space and alone time, let's talk in the morning. Will be sleeping at....'

Or: 'Kate needs rescue from husband, will be moving her home. Details in the morning.'

Or even: 'Had an accident, am at hospital. Will be home in the morning.'

Or pick up the damn phone and call you.

I'd be livid even if there was some explanation because he should know exactly what you're going through."

"She feels certain that she wants to move in with you, but to her it sounds like you want to keep your options open because you aren't sure about the relationship.

I think it's wise not to rush. You want to be 100% sure, yes, but also moving in together can be really stressful. It's a big adjustment that is more likely to go well if you are already very comfortable with each other.

I think you need to communicate to her that you have a real timeline. You will extend your lease for x months and then move in with her. That is your plan, and she can start planning for that date now (in terms of her own lease, etc).

At the same time, a nice gesture might help you out here. Like a really nice piece of jewelry or booking a romantic trip for the winter. This might show her that you aren't uncertain about whether you two will be together -- you're booking a trip together!  You are on board with planning for the future, those plans just involve moving this summer.

Assuming you're Australian, you seem to be under the impression that as soon as the clock ticks over to two years together, your partner is instantly entitled to half of what you own. 

That is not correct, and the fact you feel like you need to *rush* against the clock to get a pre-nup signed when you're not married or even engaged to this partner is kind of distasteful. It's like your rushing to the divorce before you've even gotten married. Are you even living with this girl? The only way a de facto status would be significant would be if you broke up and your partner actually took you to the family court to claim possessions and/or property from you. 

Seeing as you've been gifted a significant amount of money unexpectedly, your next stop should be to a financial advisor. Ask their advice on how you can best protect your assets.  

You're also talking about buying a house together, but also that your family member intended this money to be ""just for you"". Do you intend to go into a marriage, an arrangement where you tie yourself to someone and have lots of shared property, with assets that you do not intend to share? I honestly don't blame your partner for being upset - I can see where you're coming from, but you've approached the situation as though you see her as a suspicious usuper, not a life partner. "
So that's where your hair went...
"&gt; ETA to note that we are an Asian family so I do not think moving in with the parent and/or supporting them makes my parents a parasite.

If you are willing to accept the cultural tradition of supporting your parents financially, then you shouldn't be surprised by the cultural tradition of sexism. Of course they demand more from you than from your brother - he's male and you're female. "

"Why? Because he'd make a super great father?

He won't. You made the right decision. You're not too old to have a family, not by a long shot. 

Don't let him get to you. "
"Immediately get a post office box and stop your mail from going to the house.

Immediately obtain a locking wardrobe or put a padlock on your closet.

Immediately begin saving every dollar you can get your hands on to move out.

Never apologize ever again "
"It's ok to be upset by this and to share those feelings with your gf. But, you can't MAKE HER not flash people if that's what she wants to do. Talk to her about your feelings and maybe she'll change her behavior in the future. If she doesn't, you gotta decide if this is a dealbreaker for you or not. "
"She'll get over it.  My BFF always said I'd be a bridesmaid when she got married and then when the time came I was not (she just had two bridesmaids, both of her soon-to-be sisters in law).  I was privately surprised and hurt for about two seconds and then moved on with my life.  Had a wonderful time at the wedding.  

I'd perhaps axe Carey and just do 4 bridesmaids since it seems like there'd be a very clear line - family and BFF - whereas Carey seems similar enough to Jenna that it could make it much more hurtful if she's included."
"I do know my best friend gets paid today. I texted her on Sunday and just said ""Hey! So excited for our trip this week! Just a reminder that it is $150 per person, are the other girls good with that cost?"" And she never responded to that, and then texted me the next day about something 100% unrelated. "
"&gt; Got a great job, the people around me keep trying to find ways to belittle it...

While I'm not going to suggest that you cut off your family friends, I hope you'll consider that it's a privilege, not a right, for them to receive information about your professional life. If they make you feel belittled when you share with them, you are under no obligation to continue sharing with them.

The good news is that you're in the perfect place in your life to expand your social circle and increase your interactions with people who are going to see you for the bright, accomplished young woman you are.

"
"It's possible that you're in shock. It's also possible that this relationship ended long ago and that's why you're not grieving for it now. 

Either way it sound like this may be for the best. Good luck.

Edit: To echo others, if he wants to leave- he should leave. Waiting until the fall sounds like a bad idea for many reasons. Can you tell him that if he's going then he should go sooner rather than later?"
"""He's only sad now because his actions are affecting him rather than other people."" Exactly this. He is without conscience. He is just inconvenienced. I bet his standard of living will decrease if you two divorce. He may be reprimanded at work if the affair comes out. And his excuse for this behavior is your behavior. And a sex addiction. 

Personally, if I was married to a man like this, I would never have another moments peace. Every dude name in his cell phone might be a hot, naive paralegal. Even if things seem good, you now know that he can carry on a five month affair without you knowing.

After you stop being numb, start getting mad. I am so sorry you are dealing with this."
"Ya, female or male, you can't let people treat you that way in a work environment.  It's crazy she doesn't realize this."
"I love this idea the best. ""I barely know the girl.  I really can't have an opinion about her either way.""  It doesn't make you look bad, but it makes her seem insignificant.  When she starts telling strangers all about you and your so-called copying, it makes her look like the obsessive that she is. Do not let her turn you into a fellow obsessive!  She is too sad for you to bother about.  Remember that crazy people might convince a few people in the short run, but the craziness ALWAYS comes through in the long run.  Don't fight the battle; fight the war."
"Be glad your story isn't ""I drove drunk and killed a family of 5"""
"&gt;I love IPAs and drink anywhere between 1 and 4 every evening (5 or 6 on super stressful days) when I get home to unwind.

A healthy amount is 1 if it's 8%, 2 if it's 4%.  You are drinking far too much and he has every right to be concerned.

You don't need alcohol to unwind.

&gt;My husband says that I'm drinking enough to where I smell like alcohol 

You smell bad.  It's not nice to be around.  Imagine how smokers smell, it's not pleasant.

&gt;Anyways he refuses to be intimate let alone touch me because of this supposed odor.

Maybe try eating some gum.  Try showering.  But if nothing works, then you can't expect him to be aroused by someone who smells.

&gt;How do I resolve this issue with him?

Moderate your drinking.  Don't drink every day."
"I'm a woman and I wouldn't dress my kid in that- it's just kinda stupid to me and I don't find it cute. But I think so solution is maybe go out and buy the clothes you would like him to wear. If she does all the shopping for the baby, then she kind does have reason to dress him how she wants. Or maybe go with end and find clothes you agree on. It's your kid too and you have a right to dress him how you want just as she does."
"I get this sometimes as I have a reputation for being a good cook. When I go to someone's house they're like, ""oh its just roasted chicken you probably won't think its very good...""

What helps is to give compliments. I'll walk in the door and say, ""oh boy it sure smells good in here"" even though I know I'm smelling onions and garlic and of course it smells good. But that's a compliment coming from ""a classically trained chef"" (I was a line cook 5 years ago)

Use your reputation as an exceptional decorator and housekeeper to compliment their taste. I'm not saying be insincere, just that your opinion carries more weight and has the power to really boost people up. So if you see a piece or a room you like, say so. "
"Here's the thing: on and off never works out in the end. on and off is a huge indicator that a relationship is a mistake.

That sounds to me like SHE is his GF and you are the side piece. Or at the very least, he *wishes* that were so.

DTMFA"
"Also, once he finally had to fess up about what had happened, he immediately shifted the blame onto OP. This is not what a remorseful person with a will to change would do. This is someone hoping to deflect, blame shift, lay low, and repeatedly be unfaithful again."
"That is completely fair to ban her from your house. Obviously you can't trust her to respect anyone's privacy or belongings. You explicitly told her not to do something and she did it anyway. 

I'm a reptile owner myself and I would be pissed if someone I didn't give permission to tried to handle my snake, because ignorant people can easily hurt both themselves and the snake. 

Whether or not you want to remain friends with her and only hang out in public is up to you. "

"&gt; It doesn't mean he's cheap?

No. Are you cheap for expecting someone else to pay for you?"
You are absolutely right. I have told my wife this but she doesnt want to hear it cause 'we are her parents'
"These camps are illegal now in many states. If its illegal in your State (if you are in the US) chances are good they sent her out of state. Did your Sisters friend see anything marking the van or any information? How did she know this happened? Is she in contact with your Sister somehow? Can she find out where she is? 

I think you obviously have no reason to be concerned about what happens to your parents. So I recommend contacting a lawyer in your area that handles things like this. Your parents took money and lied about it, and there is a possibility that you can leverage that to get information out of them, and hey, even put a judgement against them. You may also be able to report this to CPS, and get her back and help her get emancipated. Or if possible, become a legal guardian, but thats a bit of a reach at this point. You certainly cant continue a relationship with these people. However, you are going to want to see what happens with your Sister, if shes forced to stay with these people and if they have control over her. So, that may be really important. 

As to how you deal with them, what they are, what they have become (chances are they were all along) is clearly manipulative, shitty parents. They may not be narcissists, but you may find lots of resources for that in r/raisedbynarcissists and r/lgbt. Im sure they have had plenty of stories like this and may be able to provide you with support and information from people that have been through this themselves. Im so sorry you have such shitty shitty parents. You need a license to drive a car, but any asshole can be a parent. "
"As you are both still dependant on your families and are not yet financially stable I can see why he wouldn't want to impose on them anymore. There's nothing wrong with him wanting to maintain a little pride in this situation.

My suggestion would be to find a compromise. Research how much a small wedding and rings would actually cost so you can start a budget. So then you can meet your parents in the middle where they can buy some stuff towards it with you both still paying for the brunt."
"Shaking her awake is the punishment.  Obviously she was fine, just asleep and simply not answering.  At that point all fears are allayed.  To continue to freak out means it wasn't about her safety, it was about disobedience.  
  
Edit: Actually.... as soon as he saw her CAR in the DRIVEWAY he should have turned his ass around and minded his business.  Someone else's comment just made me think of that.  If her car was in the driveway, he's 100% crazy because you cannot simply break into someone's house for not texting you back.  That's legit nightmare territory."

You broke your wife's trust the first time around. Now -a mere three weeks after getting married- you're at it again. She's probably feeling like you were planning this all along. The way you go about this hobby is unhealthy. It seems like you posted here hoping Reddit would validate your obsession. That's not going to happen. Please consider  therapy for yourself and you and your wife.

"There is no advice. Just control yourself or back out of this trip, better back out of your marriage because it looks like you can't really control yourself if it comes to someone who is more attractive/smart whatever"
"I can't see why they would be *that* annoyed about something like this. The mark of a good prank is that the prankee should be relieved when it's revealed to be a joke, and they should have been.

I wonder if maybe something else was going on that you don't know about? Family issues or stress of an argument between the older family member, perhaps? Maybe your harmless prank was just bad timing?

I'd wait a few days, or however long it takes for your parents to be in a good mood, then calmly go and speak to them. 

""Hi Mom/Dad. I just wanted to speak to you about the other day. We thought our prank would be funny and harmless, but you reacted really negatively, and I wanted to say sorry if we were out of line, but we didn't think what we did would upset you. Could you tell me why you all got so angry with us about it, so we can bear that in mind for the future?""

If you get something like ""don't worry about it"" then you'll know there was external circumstances. If they go into a crazy rant about body mutilation and lying then, I dunno, I guess it just wasn't the right audience. I'm willing to bet it's the former though."

"I think a certain level of sensitivity for mental issues is okay to request of someone, like a request to not talk about dieting or make comments like ""I'm so fat"", those are common requests from people with ED.

The things she is complaining about are WAY out of line, but maybe using some of the more reasonable things as a compromise would work? 

""I promise I will avoid talking about dieting or weight issues, but I am not comfortable changing how much I eat or how I dress.""

ETA: Maybe framing this as her body shaming you will get through to her? That's probably a concept that has come up in her therapy. "
"I feel like he should at least offer, even if it's technically her turn, just to double-check that everyone's still feeling ok about the arrangement. ""Are you sure? I do want to go, but I could stay home and you could go to the party if you really need a break, or I could stick around if you need some company."" - that sort of thing can go a long way towards making someone feel better about having to take one for the team."

"My SIL cheated on my brother and I've read a small mountain on the subject to try to understand what happened.

From what I've learned, my best guess is that most innocent spouses go through 1-3 years of white hot emotion. There is then a 5-10 year period where things cool down, but can be triggered up. After that, things are as good as they are going to get.

Ironically, when reconciliation is attempted and fails, it is usually the cheating spouse who leaves because the innocent spouse is ""taking too long"" to get over it.

You are in early days.

"
"I'd be surprised if my child was sick and my husband automatically assumed it was my responsibility to stay home while he went to the party as planned, unless you've already discussed this and/or you stayed home last time one of your kids was sick. "
I feel like this has to be the straw that broke the camels back not an isolated incident 
"It really was the perfect opening to defend his wife, if he felt ""awkward"" or whatever. Even just saying, ""My wife"" pointedly, since I presume they know what race she is (both from seeing her and what OP/the daughter said) would have worked, but nope! Not for him."
"Yeah, of course some stalker giving you the ol' crazy eyes will make you have a deer-in-the-headlights response, where you might just go along with them.

I just want to point out, you definitely don't ""know"" a person after only 4 months!!! They are still a stranger!!!! Honestly there are some people you could know your whole life and find out eventually that you never really know them. But 4 months is nowhere near knowing someone at all. "
"&gt; She expects me to pay her even if I do move out which is what worries me. I think I'm enabling her to not actively find a job

Pay her rent while you are there.  Stop paying her when you move out.  If she insists you still pay her, just remember that ""No"" is a complete sentence.  "
"Yeah honestly my reaction to this whole post was ""thank goodness she's getting the hell away from this guy."""

"If she wants to be with someone like her exes, let her go back to them. I'm a woman and I've always either split the bill or taken turns paying, including dates.

The standard she's so keen on sticking to comes from an era when women didn't have much in the way of employment opportunity. But even back then both parties were supposed to reciprocate. Women didn't pay, but they'd make home made meals, tasty baked treats, knitted or sewed items as gifts,  and so on. I suspect she's not holding up her end of that bargain.

Honestly, she's not going to change. You either learn to deal or bail out before you invest too long in this."
Sounds like he's telling you that the relationship won't continue as is and he needs you to work on those insecurities if you two are to move forward.
This is why you don't date for 1 year and get married at 22/23.

Your pride is doing you zero favors here :("
"You need to stop talking about being disrespectful to marriage immediately.  In your daughters eyes, you and your wife set the example for how little the sanctity of marriage counts for anything a long time ago.  You can't win with that argument and it just makes you look like a hypocrite.

"What does he do for you?

What you are describing doesn't necessarily come across as loving. It does come across as controlling, and having a poor understanding of boundaries. And like he's not particularly working on his jealousy issues. 

If you say you don't want to be touched, and he pouts, so that *you* have to comfort *him*, he's just changed the situation from one where you have (reasonably) asserted a need and asked it to be respected to one where *he* is a victim and now *you* need to cater to his victimhood, instead of him agreeing to your boundary. So in the end, he gets what he wants, and you feel uncomfortable and do things that you don't want to do.

While this might not be on purpose, it's worth your while to point it out to him. ""Hey, BF, I just told you I'm not in the mood to be touched. Why can't you respect that? Now I feel like I have to touch you to make you feel better, so I feel even worse. Why are you doing that? Why can't you be OK with us not touching for awhile if it's making me hot/uncomfortable/uneasy?""

Or, here's an idea: If he moves to touch you, and you say ""no, sorry, I don't want to be held right now"" and he pouts, don't give in to it! Do your own thing. If he gets passive-aggressive about it, call him on it ""Hey, I said I don't want to be touched right now! I am not comfortable! Stop pushing me to do things I'm not comfortable with!"". And if he tries to make you into the bad guy, refuse: He says ""I'm just trying to show you how much I love you"". You say ""Then respect when I say I'm not in the mood to be touched, *that* is showing you love me"" or ""Why don't you show me you love me in a way that I enjoy? I'd like us to not cuddle right now; that would be what feels good to me. Are you capable of doing that?"". If he ever says ""Why are you doing X thing to hurt me?"" you can always turn it back on him ""Why are YOU doing X thing that I said I don't want you go do? That hurts ME. Why are you doing it?""

If he gets mopey when you talk about it, again, call him on it ""Hey, this is a serious problem that is really bothering me. Do you not care enough to have a conversation about this with me, so we can hash out a level of touching that makes us *both* comfortable?"". 

If you feel like you have to keep accepting sub-par behavior or him pushing you to do things you don't want to do, you might want to seriously consider how great this relationship actually is. Because from what you've described, I'm having a hard time coming up with good things that would be worth feeling like you don't have personal space an autonomy with him. 

Oh, and do NOT move in with this guy until he's respecting your desire not to be touched, and learns to accept that you have guy friends and sometimes want to hang out with them. I'd be willing to bet a substantial amount of money that his controlling behaviors will ramp up 100% when you're living together.

"In case you are thinking ""he will outgrow this,""... 
 
My friend is a baby-talker. She has a naturally higher-pitched voice, but she baby-talks ALL DAY LONG. When we were in our 20's, drinking at the bar, it was adorable and hilarious when she'd be like ""I want my dwinky-winky! Where's my fucking dwinky-winky!"" or ""Me gotta go wee-wees! Who's gonna come to the bafroom with me? Drunk wee-wees NOW!"" And we'd all laugh. IT was like being around a cartoon character 24-7. 

Now, we are pushing 40. We have real, adult issues to deal with. Her husband is an abusive ass. Her mother has cancer. She doesn't text much, she prefers to call. And EVERY phone call - ""Hey, how's your Mom?"" ""Mommy is Ziiiiiiiingy-pop! Zingy swoooooosh! Ping pong pop!"" ""Um, is that good? Did she get out of the hospital?""  ""Mommy home! Yaaaaaay! Yay for Zingy swoosh pop Mommy!"" ""Oh, I'm so glad! And how are things in therapy with your husband?""  ""Poop. Poopy poop. Raaaarrrrrrrr. Husband poopy poop.""   

It's not cute anymore. It drives us all bonkers. She has a professional job so we know she is capable of speaking in a somewhat normal tone of voice, she just DOESN'T. I have tried to be gentle with her, thinking that maybe the baby voice is her way of dealing with difficult things, but she talks this way when things are great, too. It's really hard to talk to her about the voices because she seems really defensive (or even ignorant) about doing them, like ""I've always had a high-pitched voice, I can't help it!"" (But that doesn't explain the ""Wheeeee-plooopitee-doo"" cartoon noises....) 
 
I am almost 40. I can't take it. I just call her less and less.

"According to the stats I've read, open marriages have a long term failure rate of about 92%. Based on what I have observed IRL, I'd say that's somewhat accurate. I know only one couple who had an open marriage and are still together 10+ years later. One.

"Life doesn't stop just because you are in pain. And no its ALL coming from a place of pain/jealousy. Have you and hubs considered fertility counseling? 

And yes you are being petty. You miscarry right before the birth of your niece/nephew and are surprised you two weren't kept in the loop? I mean you're lucky she even had brain cells to factor in not mentioning it to you.

You've been ghosted probably because you've given the impression that you don't want to know. You either want respect and consideration for your losses or you want to be involved and kept up to the date. You can't really have it  both ways.

Your SIL has a newborn and dealing with the fact she's married a dud. She has ZERO time to hold your hand and make sure you're ok with HER life now as it stands with a baby in it. I mean really are you really REALLY expecting to have the time right now to call/text someone she may very feel resents her? Be honest with yourself about that. Not to mention you know babies are work and she's doing everything on her own. SIL likely doesn't even have time for herself let alone your hurt feelings. Dealing with her brother is a known factor for her. 

Before you reach out YOU need to deal with the emotions wrapped up wth not only your miscarriages but also a new baby in the family. "
"having to respond right away, having to be responsible for fully informing him of who *might* be around you, not able to be honest about your feelings - are FLAMING red flags that this is not a suitable relationship. Dropping by unannounced at dark-o-clock - fucking weird.  Tell your family that you're ending the relationship, that this guy has been a bit weird and you just need them to be aware that you're ending it and it may not go so well. When you end it do not agree to be friends, or keep in touch.  Firmly say ""I do not want to be in this relationship and I'm ending things. Please do not contact me again."" If he contacts you again either ignore, or reply with ""please do not contact me or I will contact the police."" doesn't matter if it's the first or fifth time - reply ONCE with do not contact, and if he does again you need to actually contact the police.    You can do this - you will get through this. Trust your gut that things are not right."

you should edit the post to clarify that he drove her to the hospital but was not in the birthing room with her and that she also called her mother almost immediately to be with her during the birth. it changes the whole story quite a bit

I would agree but for the fact that he looks at it while you're home frequently. That coupled with...

...makes me think you want his sexual energy to be directed more at you.

Maybe have another conversation about your sexual needs and his; try and find a middle ground to give him some ""alone time"" and to give you more attention on that front as well."

He likely has a ton of issues regarding abandonment and many other topics that are beyond reddits scope to talk about because we cannot/should not be diagnosing him. But he certainly could use therapy, for a number of reasons. 

As someone who had a family memeber who had issues as a child that were never addressed (adult now), I urge you to get him help now. 
In 4 years time he'll legally be an adult and nobody will be able to help him. 

He's young, it's not too late. He can turn his life around but right now, what he really needs in his life right now is a brave adult who will stand up, create boundries, structure, and not play into his manipulation techniques.

"The best way to reset your brain to women= people is through therapy. 

However, if you don't have the time, inclination, or money for therapy (although it sounds like you're a student, which means you may have better access!), one thing that's helped a few of my friends is empathizing more with women. Consume books and media with female protagonists-- watch Broad City, read Ella Enchanted or Jane Eyre. You KNOW logically that women are human beings, but this could help you internalize that.

And STOP going to misogynistic subreddits. You're enforcing an unhealthy divide between you and ""them."""

His personality doesn't sound too decent. He sounds like he is a misogynist who is pissed that women don't like him. It's because he's not attractive, thinks he's superior, and is so judgemental.

"I have broken up with one person not-in-person. It was over text. And that was because I tried to break up with him *three times* in person, and he simply would NOT accept that we were done. 

So what I was literally left with was getting all the stuff that was important to me out of his place, then texting him that we were done.

(This is actually an oversimplification. I first called him and said we needed to meet in person to talk. Him being the asshole he was, smugly said no. If I had anything to say to him, I could come to his place and say it. Anything else was unacceptable. I got so upset at his games that I dropped my phone by accident and broke part of it (I could hear him, but he couldn't hear me). So I texted him the break up message. Which he STILL didn't accept for over a month.)

I don't know if you're like my ex at all, but the things you wrote (about her saying you're not the person for her, and basically wearing her down into getting back with you before) sounds like you have at least some of his characteristics. 

A relationship takes two to get into, but a break-up only takes one person to decide. It doesn't matter if you want to break up or not, really. She does. Full stop. Let it go. 

So grow up, learn to respect boundaries, let your **EX**-GF go as she requested, and maybe spend your time figuring out if you're a good person to date, and if not, work on that. 

"
"&gt; Deep down your parents are probably pretty hurt and ashamed they couldn't give you a better life. Their reaction right now is extremely defensive.

I think this is a very likely explanation for it. It probably makes them feel very hurt and like failures that they couldn't give you the life they wanted, but 'successful' Katie could have, and it's just another thing Katie got right that they didn't get right.

However, it is also their fault for reading your diary. That is a grossly unacceptable invasion of privacy, and it is unfair to punish you and emotionally manipulate you for your private thoughts that they only know about because they read something not intended for them. "
"Time to set rigid boundaries with your boyfriend: ""Boyfriend, I feel as if you don't respect my boundaries when it comes to my relationship with my dad. My relationship with him is where I'm comfortable with it and it's unfair for you to try and pressure me into having a ""better"" relationship with him when I don't want to have one. Please, stop pushing this subject because it's really starting to affect how I feel about our relationship in general."" See where this conversation takes you.

If he can't start respecting your boundaries on this, then that may be a sign that you two aren't meant to be for the long term. "
No one is hot enough to get away with this shit. I can't believe she married him! 
"Why bother if she already feels unsafe? Breakup by text and move on. If he shows up, call the cops."
"I think your wife resents you. Why? 

I recognise a littttle bit of my behaviour in my relationship in your story but from the other perspective. 

My boyfriend takes ZERO initiative at home. Sometimes I get home from work, having cooked all week, and he's not bought any ingredients or preheated the oven or started dinner on his own. I get annoyed. It's not that hard, we both work full time, so why is this my responsibility? He says ""oh relax, I'll do it then. What have we got, what do we need? What shall I make?"" Jesus. Christ. Then I end up saying ""oh no, I'll do it"" cause it's faster and easier than handholding and I get so mad. 

Your statement about not caring if a woman doesn't cook or does cook is weird. Do you cook? Do you clean? I'm sure my BF would say he does, but I say he doesn't. You should ask her if the split is fair. I find most men are brought up differently in this way, where they may not truly recognise that taking care of a house and another person is way more than sweeping, dishes and flushing the toilet. 

Also, he likes to stay at home a lot. We have different interests. So sometimes when we have plans to go somewhere and he gets sick/gets a headache/can't be bothered I get pissed off too. Why this one time? Is he faking? I would never do this, etc.. It snowballs. 

I think if you're not very thoughtful or romantic, and she has a short temper, this is a recipe for disaster. 

Fortunately my boyfriend and I are not married, so we have room to move on this. I love him so much, he's so great in other ways. I think your wife loves you too, cause she feels bad about her behaviour. That's good. i feel bad about my behaviour too. But he really annoys me with his carelessness too. 

You should definitely talk to her. Don't let the conversation get too heated, maybe you could let her know the conversation is coming and give her time to think about her points then be calm about them. It won't be fixed without communication, the two of you will only get more bitter. "
"He can defend his own boundaries without that being ""taking it out on someone sick.""

His ""help"" is not helping her, it's holding her back and its fucking him up in the process
She will never ever take responsability until her family stop enabling her. How long will this go on? Does Nick expect to support her forever? Take her in once mum dies? What is the long-term plan here?

As we say here: ""Don't set yourself on fire just to keep someone else warm.""  Fine, maybe she does really need help, but (a) that doesnt mean it's his job (it's moms, if anyone) and (b) that doesnt mean he has to *sacrifice* his *own* life just to prop up *hers*.

Maybe not all her behaviour is her ""fault"" and maybe much of it is due to her condition, but I'm seeing a lot that is pure laziness and is NOT a result of an actual medical/psychological condition at all. 

Ultimately, he really needs to get out of that house.



TLDR"" He needs to edge away from her"
"See, it's tricky - because we don't really know if he's actually dangerous or not. I've personally had a couple bad experiences though, so would really want someone with me, or to do it via text.

BUT a text breakup could absolutely send an unstable person over the edge... it's adding insult to injury for some.

And wondering when some enraged person is going to show up trying to break down your door is a horror. At least face to face you can gauge how they are taking it.

But that doesn't mean, necessarily, they wouldn't *still* show up in a fit of anger, even if you did the most gentle face to face break up ever.

We really don't know with this guy."
I ain't sayin' she a gold digger but she ain't messing with no broke...
"When I confronted him about it and told him how crazy it was, he kept saying ""you know me. I wouldn't do that to you (stalk), you know me"" and it's fucking terrifying because I don't believe him but when someone is staring you dead in the eye, how do you not??"
"&gt;""don't mind me, just bashed my ankle over here"" or something similar (not exactly that, I can't think of an exact example, but similar and definitely the same tone.) After which, of course, I always get up and go, ""Oh! Oh my god, are you okay?"" etc. Most of the time his answer is, ""Yes I'm fine, just in pain. No I don't need any help.""

OK, so you know how this game works now, so you can stop playing. He likes getting the extra reaction out of you. Stop rewarding him with that, because you're just training him to continue. 

Next time it should go like this:

Him: ""don't mind me, just bashed my ankle over here""

You, not looking up from whatever you're doing: ""Ha, you're such a trooper! Let me know if you need a hand.""

&gt;Afterwards he always gets really sulky and grumpy, too, but nothing I do seems to ""make up"" for it.

Don't put any effort into trying to make up for it. You haven't done anything wrong, so again anything you do at this point is just rewarding his bad behavior. Just go about your life, and he can quit sulking like a toddler whenever he feels like it."
"&gt;just have a little compassion that this might have a deeper meaning for her

That's exactly what's missing from his narrative."
"""I'm afraid that the way I dress and what I do or don't put in my body is a decision I make for myself, and I can't change that for other people."""

She's already on birth control. I've always been upfront about her sexual health and habits because my mom is my only parent and a hardcore feminist 
yes! why is she immediately blaming the wives? everything negative in this post is about these three weirdos being weirdos.
"IANAL and I'd probably crosspost this to r/legaladvice for more advice. 

Here's what I'd do in this situation:

1) Immediately call CPS and report this to them. I have no clue what laws are in place for this situation, but CPS needs to know your parents knowingly placed your sister in a potentially abusive situation. 

2) Talk to the police and see if there is anything that can be done to find your sister, and find out if your father lying to you to get the money could count as fraud since you were unaware of its intended purpose. 

3) Butter up your parents low key. Make them think you want to support them in this idea and see if they'll inadvertently give you info about where your sister is. 

4) Consult local family law attorneys and get advice on what to do. Could you file for guardianship, take them to court, etc etc. 

5) Document anything your parents say about your sister. Texts, emails, summarize in person convos, with dates and details in case you need to show they are neglecting/abusing her. 

6) Don't say anything to acquaintances of your parents unless completely forced. While it may feel good to trash your parents (and rightfully so) if you can show that you have been aboveboard in all aspects of this that could help you legally. 

7) Support your sister and be honest with her. This is going to mess her up emotionally. Be there for her. Give her the chance to open up to you and be vulnerable without fear of reprisal. Make it very obvious to her that she is your concern, not your parents. 

8) Seriously consider cutting off your parents. After your sister is back and safe, tell them to go fuck themselves and cut them off. Ignoring your sister's situation, as bad as it is, they are bad to you too because they take from you and lie to you. 

"
"Out of these options I keep coming back to number one.  There is no  bad men from the past, no friends either, he was always a loner in the truest sense and really (says) he doesn't or can't connect with people. Maybe there is another woman and he's to chicken to say so.  This doesn't help if that's the case!! And of course, maybe he needed some mental/physical space. A break. I so get that. I am so on board.  Me too!! I'd be happy to have him go for a night if only he'd communicate that. And he's not a bad communicator.  I am just assuming if it's not drugs or someone else, he is bracing himself for ending it or laying some heavy ""things have to change"" talk on me.  Not sure when I will be calm enough to listen now though...September maybe. "
I'm betting righteous indignation. She probably went and called every single person who's been pressuring him and whined and cried about how much she still loves him and she doesn't understand why he can't see that and he should be supportive and understanding about her needing to follow her dreams.
"I'll say one thing, as a woman, based off of your description I wouldn't date him because he seems to be a bit of a dick and would rather play the blame game than actually work on the problem. 

I was friends with one guy, while he was okay to shoot shit with, he was too boring to date and his personality was far too clingy. He stopped being my friend when he wouldn't stop whining about how ""nice guys finish last."" I cut him out of my life after he refused to accept that he had to be happy with himself and be a bit less boring to get a girl and that I didn't owe him my vagina because he's nice to me. 

The fact he's saying the women you're finding are damaged and you're tricking them proves to me he's why he can't get girls and it's not your responsibility to fix it. "
"Sex change?

If he's decided all women, including you, financially use/abuse all men and never contribute a cent, nothing a woman can ever say or do will change his mind."
"Sit your wife down and explain that while you understand her fears/concerns, treating your daughter different BECAUSE SHE IS A GIRL IS STUPID SEXIST AND WILL NOT WORK.

Your daughter is smart and you've both presumably raised her well to be aware of her situations AND to come to you both if there is a problem. Trust is the foundation you've laid down. And FFS going to parties does no get one the label of 'easy'. 

She will sneak out and she will rebel more than what is ""normal"" because of her mother. Remind your wife that its 2017 and your daughter is not a bloody idiot.

Could something bad happen? Sure that's life. Restricting her will not PROTECT her. 

Also kudos for not being the typical dad and having your wife's mentality that the rules need to be different for your daughter. 

i'll assume your daughter is also the only child left and obviously a few short years away from being out of the house and enjoying young adulthood. I'd remind your wife also that she's not going to be 16 and your baby forever. Enjoy the new stages in her life and the ups and downs that come with them."
"Why do you feel bad for stopping somebody who was making you feel uncomfortable?

You should be upset at him for not listening to you.

Honestly, you shouldn't have to explain yourself he should.

Seriously, ask yourself why you are apologizing when he did you wrong. 

"
"&gt;In the first year we were together, he made some big positive changes largely because they were important to me and I guess I gave him the kick in the pants he needed. He: got a better visitation schedule, quit smoking weed cold turkey (hasn't touched it in over 2 years), finished his Bachelor's degree, and got a higher paying job. Our entire relationship, he has done everything he's said he would, even these things that (in my opinion) would take many people a long time to accomplish

So he got he finally got his life together for a girlfriend, but not his two daughters who were in the picture for far longer than you. what does that say about him? I am wondering what exactly was attractive about a guy with two baby mamas (not even ex-wives) who barely saw his kids until you demanded it. The guy still doesn't even see his kids that often.

&gt;We both want to get married and have (more) kids. I know he's not simply ""agreeing"" to have more kids because I want them. He truly wants to have children with me and is very excited about the prospect.

Of course he's fine with bringing new life into the world like he's buying a goldfish, he clearly doesn't put much thought into it judging from his history. Are you OK with potentially being baby mama #3 to the next girlfriend though? 



"
[removed]
In fact I'd recommend that you don't tell her it's because of bad sex. That's just going to hurt her feelings. Just go with the lack of chemistry thing.
"If you truly want your own biological kids, then you need to break up with your gf and start dating women who also want children. 

This is a fundamental incompatibility. A dealbreaker. 

"
"Not only that but she said he didn't offer to pay for damaging her patio door which he broke. Then proceeds to love bomb her about how much he cares.

Yeah she needs to dump him and report the incident to the police."
"&gt;it would need to be someone familiar to us, most probably a friend of ours.

NOOOO.

&gt;I don't think the relationship dynamic of our little group of friends will really survive this,

It wont."
"You put his wife in the position of buying a wedding gift for someone who didn't even respect her marriage enough to not jump on her husband. That's pretty cold and selfish.

Finding out your soon to be spouse doesn't respect marriage is a pretty solid deal-breaker for most people. If you want to convince anyone you've changed, you need to own up to what you did and come clean with Tommy's wife. Otherwise, you're still covering up what you did."
"I believed everything my mom told me growing up.  Why would she lie to me? And my dad and SM kept quiet about drama so I only ever heard one side of the story.  I feel badly that it took me so long to see through it.  I started going to counseling, which has helped tremendously to start unraveling all of the lies.  It's been painful but so liberating too.  All of these things that didn't ever sit right with me, I now can see it is because I knew something was off but I didn't know what. 

"
"Damn yo come the morning we gonna need an update. This got me riveting. 

I'd say ""if you can't tell me what is happening then I'm done.""

Try to sleep with my doors super locked and pray his ass better be on the front porch by morning. Then reel his asshole in when he walks in the door.

This isn't okay to do to someone last minute.

Fuck even if he was just doing some bullshit that wasn't a big deal, I would still tell
Him I need time to think about our relationship because whoever does that to someone with a kid at night is an inconsiderate fuck. "
"You keep focusing on her, but the issue is that the intimacy is gone. After she leaves, you still won't have the intimacy with your husband. You need to address that."
"&gt; You should not lose weight.

No one else said this yet? I see one way she could lose about 150 useless pounds overnight."
"I wasn't with him when he had his tests done, I had no reason to think he wouldn't be truthful at the time. I'm crying now thinking that I could have been hoping for something he knew wouldn't happen."
"Yeah, it is bizarre for so many people to have similar reactions for there not to be *something* triggering it. OP might just not be aware of how bespoke or over the top her home is. Not that there is anything wrong with having a very meticulously designed/organized place, but to have that confirmed by others might help her not feel alienated by the comments. 

It's kind of like if you're a gorgeous human who doesn't know that you're in the top 1% of attractiveness- you'd probably feel weirded out by certain comments until you come to terms with how other people see you. "
"It's always okay to avoid racists.

This doesn't particularly change anything, but light-skinned, European-looking Colombians consider themselves white. So they probably don't see their own family as interracial even though most Americans would."
"I think when someone of his age begins to behave in a way that is out of character, it is well worth encouraging them to go to the doctor for a check up. 

I'm confused however about whether or not this is out of character for him. You say he's done this with co-workers etc. Is that recently? "
"So first you got upset that she tried to involve you, then you got upset that she didn't involve you, and now you insist that a new mother with a fussy/colicky baby cater to your feelings while you smugly revel in baby and mother's difficulties. Nice. 

You need to get rid of the ""should"" mentality. Nobody is guaranteed a baby. Between the fact that you feel entitled to a child and the fact that you think that SIL doesn't deserve a child, you frankly don't belong anywhere near that baby until you work your own issues out. If I were your SIL and I read this there's no way in hell I'd let you anywhere near my kid. 

Work on resolving your own bitterness and jealousy and processing your grief before trying to patch things up with your SIL. And don't expect the relationship to ever be the same."
As Napoleon put it: Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. These kinds of ridiculous lies are just your ex hanging himself with his own rope. Listen to your lawyer and stay out of it.
"A nice way to frame it if she's gullible, but in practice a prenup us almost always to protect one party."
"Your post history is: 

&gt; My [23] girlfriend [21] of 3 years rarely ever compliments me.

&gt; My [23] girlfriend [21] refuses to introduce me to her friends/ invite me out to events and outings. On top of that she refuses to meet my friends as well

And now

&gt; My [23] girlfriend [21] of 3 years refuses to have dinner w my family.

Are you sure this girl actually wants to be in a relationship with you? Because it doesn't sound like it. "
"I've been Hallie. Pointed out that my best friend's shitty boyfriend was shitty, and promptly got frozen out by her and by the half of our common friends who bought into her ""me or her"" ultimatum. It was horrible. Ruined my last year of high school and was a really, really hard thing for me to shake. 

However. When she reached out to me 4 or so years later, it made me really happy.  She had dumped him, moved on, and gotten her life together, and I was happy to hear it. My friend and I started getting together again and rebuilt a friendship that I'm really happy with. We'll never be what we were to eachother - you can't go back in time, afterall - but we're close, and we're cool, and  we continue to be important to eachother. 

So I say do it. Even if she isn't game to try to be friends again, I bet she'll be happy to know that you've moved on and are well."
"Yeah this is crazy. Also a girl you've been with for just over one year versus your little sister turning 18?? Extremely different levels of relationship there, if your girlfriend 'feels it's unfair' she's bad news."
"Just because you don't behave perfectly, and can contribute to difficulties in a relationship, doesn't mean your husband isn't abusive.

That's often how abusers work: They blame the victim for not behaving *perfectly*, and use that to excuse the abuse. No one will ever be perfect, all the time, so there is always a reason to abuse them.

You don't have to be perfect to deserve not to be absused. 

You can acknowledge your own faults and mistakes, and still hold your husband accountable for abuse. Your therapist likely understands that just fine."
"&gt; The fact that they are mad doesn't mean you did anything wrong.

I really like this because it's true in so many situations. "
"I'm confused here. Were you in contact with her while you were performing your service? Did she give you any indication that she was unhappy/detaching from the relationship over the last 3 years? Did you see her on leave, etc?"
"Does it matter?

What I mean is whether she's asexual or not it won't change the simple fact that you're unsatisfied with your sex life and you can't change who she is. 

You're far too young to mire yourself in an I satisfying relationship. It's okay to part ways over it. "
"No, it's not about you not being interesting enough, it's about him being a massive douchebag who enjoys manipulating other people.

Another thing: what do you intend to do? Go with him on that trip? Girl, don't. His presence there will make it unbearable and painful. "
"PLEASE tell someone - a friend or even a coworker who you trust. You can't go through this alone. You need to do what's best for you and your child.

Edit: And please realize that he isolated you by accusing you of badmouthing him to your family - now you feel that you can't talk to them about anything because you don't want to upset him. Textbook abuse."
"Then do it. I'm astounded that you had to come here when you could have just taken over the task yourself. 

I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas. 

What's appropriate to dress the child in is completely subjective. So if you want him in other stuff buy clothes and dress him. You don't need the internet to tell you she's wrong. "
"When you grow up in an environment of abuse, your ""normal meter"" gets way off. It surprised me how long it took for me to figure out ""hey, our family is seriously dysfunctional. Like, the only thing that could possibly fix this is tons of therapy, and that is never happening."" I was around 17, almost an adult before I realized something was wrong. Yes, OP's sister took a while, but she might have not had the exposure to realize just how off her normal meter was. "
"It is the worst. I hope OP doesn't tell Lucy that she had ""family"" there. Because when you get married, you ARE family. The primary family. 

This incident and how OP responded to it and views it shows that he's not ready to get married and become family with her.

 "
"The only thing I'd add to this excellent script is that as HR staff, it's especially important that they avoid not only actual impropriety but even the appearance of impropriety. As things stand, they're edging into creating a hostile work environment that is making their coworkers uncomfortable. "
"When you go to the jeweler's to pick up the ring make sure to bring it up that you are unhappy that they released it to someone other than you. Do not brin up that it's your father because many people respond to that with ""well he's your father he wouldn't do anything to it."" Just tell them that the ring could have been damaged or stolen from you and that it is poor business etiquette to just hand it over to someone who isn't on the order.

You also need to talk to your father about boundaries. He needs to know that doing things like that is unacceptable because they aren't his to do. This needs to be done before wedding planning gets into ill swing because I guarantee he will try to take over that process too. And then you'll be fighting your father every step of the way over what food, which venue, how many guests; and he'll also try to find away to pay with his credit card and ask you to give him cash. (Which, btw, I would personally be irritated by because he's building up his own credit without even giving you the chance to improve your own.)

If you don't set up boundaries for this now he will do it throughout the wedding planning process, when you're buying/selling a house, any home improvements you do, any business you start for yourself, things you do with your future children, etc."
"Stop cuddling the guy. You're not into him. You're not GOING to be into him. If you were, you'd already be all over that.

I don't often tell someone they are leading someone on, but honey, **you're leading him on**.

Stop it. It's cruel."
Wow. This is actually something I didn't consider and you might have changed my mind on the issue altogether.
"You are not 'supporting' her, you are paying your fair share (below if anything) to live there. "
"I don't understand why he couldn't have simply told you early on in the relationship that he never wanted children and that his intention was to get a vasectomy? There's something not right about this; he should have told you, but instead he demonstrated that he doesn't trust you. Did he actually go to therapy? Or is that a lie too? Your whole relationships is built on omissions and lack of trust. I think this is as insulting as his previous behavior. I would be questioning the marriage...you may want to seriously consider marital counseling."
"I mean, and this is somewhat extreme, but if talking to this girl doesn't work, have you considered installing a web/security cam in your house where it could catch this? "
"Forget your friends for a minute:

The most important question right now is *If you have the baby, can you support yourself and it*.

If the answer is no, then you have a choice to make. Either have it and adopt it out, or terminate.

If you cannot take care of a child, then it is selfish and cruel to have that child. 

NOW, adding in your friends. If you decide to not terminate, you MUST tell them. It is not right for you to hide a child from its father. "
"&gt;and that one time when she paid her part of the bills for 6 months straight she didn't understand why she didn't get a ring. 

W.o.w. Holy fuck op. I think my mouth dropped open. You are right to see that these are all red flags. She is not approaching this relationship with the same attitude as you. She is only doing what she thinks will convince you to give her what she wants.

IMO you should listen carefully to your own words and realize what kind of person she is. If you want to be equal partners with someone who treats you thoughtfully like a human being they respect, not a cash cow or ticket to social success, you need to leave her and go find that person."
"Sounds like he just placated you.  You need to ask and get an actual answer,  not that vague bs."
"Oh, and I'm gonna double comment here. One of the more subtly terrible things in this sad post was him just tossing this list of awful, awful grievances on his desk, in the open, for her to find. Stuff that he wrote that he knew wasn't legitimate. He should have hid it, or been so ashamed that he got rid of it, for what he's put her through.

It was such a small act that speaks volumes about where his brain was at. Didn't even consider ""hmm, maybe I shouldn't put this in a place where she might come across it because it would devastate her to read it."" His thoughts are all about him, most of the time."
"&gt; (When she saw the picture) she started laughing so hard she could hardly breathe....

I want to be like your step mom when I grow up. "
No we move a lot and her side of the family is kinda a bunch of jerks so it's really just her these days and I think she sees a therapist once a week
"&gt;You had to come to the realization yourself...

My dad and SM said they had hoped that maybe she would be more sane to us kids than she was to them.  They haven't told me a lot because they say that their relationship with her shouldn't change my relationship with her.  But, they did clear up some things.  My mom always said that dad stole everything from her in the divorce, but he had come into the marriage with the house/cars/ investments.  They had signed a prenup with an infidelity clause and my mom had cheated on my dad leaving him for my stepdad.   My dad had still paid her out quite a bit of money to help get her on her feet, but she didn't get a job and blew it on a huge vacation and new car that she crashed driving drunk.  The fines ate up the last of the money.  I remember her telling me that her car broke down and dad had towed it away saying he was going to fix it, but never did. I remember being mad that my dad wouldn't help my mom out when he was really good with cars. I don't know all the stories, but I question a lot of the ""I was mad at dad"" memories.

It's so weird to look back on your life and not even know what you don't know.  I am questioning everything.  I wish dad and SM would tell me more, but I understand that they want me to come to my own relationship with my mom too.  She is crazy, but she wasn't completely terrible all the time.

The hardest thing has been with my little sister, who has always been one of my best friends.  Even though she has seen what my mom did with my wedding, she also has my had my mom crying to her the whole time.  There were many times where my sister would call me and tell me that I was being unreasonable with mom.  It has put a bit of a wedge between us and I am not sure how to handle it."
"&gt;maybe I've overstepped a boundary here by infringing on their privacy and their right to solve problems within the family.

There are children involved. The adults in that family are not protecting them. If you witnessed this one event and the parent didn't think it was worth pressing charges, imagine what other kinds of abuse the kids are witnessing - or being victims of - on a regular basis.

I can't tell you what to do, and there's a chance the adults will be angry. But if you do testify, know that what you're doing is quietly heroic."
"We've been having trouble for the past 3 or 4 years, but I'm not really in a great headspace to make major relationship decisions so I don't want to do something dumb."
"Wow, Ellen is a fucking psycho. Jesus H. I don't really have any advice for you in the short term except to say that Rob seems to function for you much like porn functions for a lot of people. 

Are we sure Ellen isn't trying to steal Greg from you honestly? That statement ""She told me I was an awful wife and didn't deserve Greg."" suggests that she can think of someone who *does* ""deserve"" Greg."
"&gt;  he decided to throw that all away by sleeping with some floozy!?   

Really OP. The girl had more integrity than your husband. So stop labeling her to make it easier for you to swallow your husband's betrayal."
"Sooooo I just took a peek at your post history. Are these dates nights a remnant from when you almost cheated on her with a coworker, and realized you were bored and needed to rekindle the marriage? Because if that's the case, wow dude. Do you really not get why she'd be upset at you for bailing in the middle of a date for something as trivial as conditioner? That she might have seen this as a signal that you're getting bored/complacent again? "
"Maybe bring it up as a potential health issue that she should check with her doctor about? You said you brought up doctor before, I wasn't sure how you framed it then.

But it would concern me if my partner blew off my feelings in such a way about anything, even if it's about farts. Even if he thinks something is unimportant, if it's important to me it's important to him. She doesn't seem to care about how you're feeling, what if it was a bigger issue? "
"&gt; It's a conversation with your father explaining to him what you heard and you would like to know what his stance is.
&gt; 


Maria kinda implied that she will make my father choose between her and my sister while talking to that person. But if I know my father, and I do know him pretty well, it's an easy choice. My sister all the way. She is the textbook definition of a daddy's girl, the apple of his eye if you will. 

What I am guessing here is that Maria is jealous of that close relationship my father has with my sister. There is also the fact that my sister is a carbon copy of our mother and she is basically a walking reminder of her (another reason as to why my dad is so fond of her). But yeah, everything else you said is spot on and I may have a word with him once he flies back home from his trip."
This is a HUGE red flag. He's attracted to adolescents.... it's not normal for a 29 year old man to be so interested in 15 year old girls. 
"""Let's start with a two-some and work up, eh, tiger?""

ffs."
"&gt; Also, she told me that me politely declining second helpings was triggering for her because I was the only one who did not have second helpings and it made her ""feel like a pig"" (her words, not mine).

Makes me wonder if everyone took second helpings because she already pulled this line on them, and they're trying to cater to her feelings."
"If you weren't mentioned in the will, there is no reason you needed to be filled in on the details of the will. 

It's fair to be upset with your father for his *lack of support* of his children post-divorce. If you are angry with him for not contributing to the safety and stability of his teenage children, that is absolutely worth speaking to him about directly. I understand the inheritance rubs salt in that wound, but it's the original wound that is really the problem.

Treat this information as a further symptom of the issue, not the issue in and of itself—and talk it over with your Mom as well. It's unlikely speaking to your father will achieve anything, but I'd advise you to take your mother's advice seriously, especially while they are still engaged in some of the legal aspects of the divorce. Your Dad sounds like a total ass, confronting him right away might make things worse for your Mom."
"Yeah... you seriously failed your fiancee here. You added stress, worry and abandonment to a time when she should have been able to focus 100% on her own recovery.  More critically, your fiancee had no *choice* about being in the hospital. She was sick. Your sister, on the other hand, is a grown woman who chose to get drunk and be a party girl.  Nothing against drinking or partying but your sister seems not to have been very responsible about it, so her being ""in trouble"" was the obvious consequence of her own actions. If your sister had some kind of emergency that was NOT of her own making then I suspect your fiancee would be a lot more forgiving.

Also, I hate to be sinister, but at the time your sister called, did she know your fiancee was already in the hospital?  I can't help wondering if this was a little ploy for attention on her part, especially if you two are as close as you say and if she's having trouble letting go.  There's not enough information in your post to say for sure, but it's a possibility you might want to take into consideration."
"You aren't even moving on quickly. People tend to have strange expectations depending on gender: A widower needs a new wife almost immediately because he can't be expected to cook or clean. But a widow should stay single forever, dedicated to the memory of her late husband's ... member.

Not sure how you politely make the point that everyone's being unreasonable, but they are. 

Good luck."
"Ma'am, your son used his penis in me."
"You know, if for some reason he hadn't been sleeping when you tried to call him five times and then you took the liberty of letting yourself into his house and caught him in the middle of something he didn't want you to see, or he wasn't there, then you'd be at fault? I've seen posts in this subreddit where somebody lets themselves into somebody else's home to ""wake them up"" and the consensus is ""that's crazy.""

You mentioned in the comments that you dated before, and he broke up with you. Frankly, I'm suspicious that this friendship you've maintained isn't really on equal footing. Of all my friends I would not let a single one of them treat me like this without telling them to get off their fucking high horse and text me when they want to act normal.

I would be very wary of being friends with an ex that manipulates you into apologizing for things that you didn't do wrong. Start taking a hard look at your interactions with him and see if this is the case more often. Maybe you can now say  you don't want to be in a relationship with him, but the fact that he dumped you and then expects you to do all this emotional labor for the friendship could be seen as you desperately trying to keep in in your life (I.e. You're settling to be the friend now that you can't be the girl-friend) and him taking advantage of it.

If you have any hopes of an equal-footing friendship continuing in the future you MUST put your foot down and let him know that you're not apologizing for this. You MUST set a precedent for future interactions because no friendship should have this kind of dynamic."
"I dunno, I have to disagree with people who say you were played. He told you from the beginning that he had to marry an Indian woman - the choice to not take that seriously was yours. "
"Honestly, I would just break up with him. The suspicion would eat me alive. It sounds like your boyfriend wants to have his cake and eat it too. "
[deleted]
"Dude that's ridiculous. If anything, you deserve an apology from him. You've fucking helped his family moved 6 times! And he isn't being kind at all. For me, and my fiancé knows this, my family is everything and if he gets to see his family multiple times a week and I only get to see them once a month - you bet damn right I'm gonna go see them the first chance I get and not feel guilty over it. As should you. "
"Your girlfriend is not wrong. I saw this happen with my mother and grandmother. My parents paid thousands of dollars because my grandmother had nothing.

However, you can't *require* an adult to do any of these things. And quite honestly, if you're helping a 46-year-old with her bills (and she has zero savings), there's not going to be a ton there at retirement age for her, anyway. The sad truth of the matter is your mom probably won't be able to fully retire, unless and until her health declines.

I'm a proponent of Dave Ramsey, so your mom might be open to his books and his teachings. He offers a ""baby step"" program that helps people get their emergency fund in place, pay off debts, and then start funding retirement. Once your mom calms down a bit, you may want to see if she'd be open to listening to his radio show and/or reading a couple of his books.

And as for the people saying your girlfriend is entitled or you sound ungrateful, don't listen to that. I absolutely despise when parents think they'll just rely on their kids to take care of them in old age. First of all, not everyone is able to do this (what if you yourself develop an illness, or lose your job, or get an amazing opportunity halfway across the world?). Not everyone is emotionally capable. Your mom could pass away suddenly at 55, she could live until 100 jogging up and down the streets, or she could become ill and linger on for months or years. It's the height of selfishness for a parent to expect a child to put their financial security and personal life on hold to be a caregiver for an undetermined amount of time. 

But again, the truth is if your mom hasn't had any plan in place by now, she's not going to get one. So you and your future bride do need to have the conversation ... how much do we allow here? Do you continue paying her bills? Do you let her move in with you? Do you let her move in with you after two kids and another baby on the way? Do you put your foot down after a certain amount or is your pocketbook just open?

Finally, if you're going to continue to provide financially for your mom (which is a perfectly fine choice, just like choosing to not do so is also fine), I would say to never put her needs above your own. Meaning, when you do get married and especially once you have children, your family needs to come first. *Your* retirement and future plans need to come first, so they don't end up with the amount of stress your mom is placing on you and your future. "
"&gt;Is there a non-awkward, fedora-compatible way to say these things

No. Of course there isn't. The entire fedora-m'lady strategy is to take advantage of social conventions and social conditioning against making things awkward. 

On some level, he *knows* you don't want to make things awkward and he's counting on that. 

The better questions to ask are:

Do you think this guy is capable of and inclined to learn better behavior?

Do you want to put in the effort and labor of being the one to teach him?

""No"" is a perfectly good answer to *either* question. 

You can **absolutely** ghost him.

You can stop him when he goes in for a hug. He'll *make* it awkward, but be firm. ""NO! I do NOT want you to hug me, not now or ever again unless I offer first."" He'll hem and haw and act hurt. *Say nothing*. Ignore his attempts at guilt, and just move on. 

If he says ""text me when you get home"" you *absolutely* can reply ""Nope! Not going to do that!""

&gt; I know it's just his idea of being caring and polite

No, it's not. It's not his idea of being polite. It's not his idea of being ""caring"" in the sense of how we regard our peers and friends. It's his attempt to sneak romantic conventions into your non-romantic interactions. 

Yeah, he'll act *super* butthurt if you call it out. Because that too is part of the strategy. 

Ghost him. "
"Yes, good point! Thank you."
"You don't deserve this. *You don't deserve this.*

People tell you that all the time, I'm sure, but I know how hard it can be to believe. *You don't deserve this.*

Leases can be bought out. You can sublet. You can eat the penalty and walk. You are *not* trapped. Don't behave and make decisions as if you are. That's not your life anymore. You escaped, remember? 

But that's the thing. It's hard to feel like you did get out. Your C-PTSD makes you feel like you're still just *surviving*, little by little.

You may not be ready to be with someone. Your boyfriend certainly doesn't sound like he is ready or willing to be with you *as you are*. 

I know. It's so much to ask of you to even think about it. It's hard, and I'm sorry, but this relationship you describe, as you're living it? It doesn't sound good for you. And you *don't deserve it*. 

What is deserving it, anyway? Would you wish this on someone else? Would it seem fair to you to sentence a 22 year old survivor of severe abuse to a boyfriend who would rather play video games than make sure she's healthy? To a boyfriend who doesn't understand or *want* to understand what she's going through? Is this a fair punishment for the crime of being sick?

He doesn't have to be a bad person to be a bad boyfriend, *for you*, the person *you* are at this exact moment in time. He doesn't have to be as bad as your abuser for you to go. You don't deserve this. You don't. No one 'deserves this'. Relationships aren't about what we deserve, they're about what we need. You aren't getting what you need. Deserving has nothing to do with it.

And even if it did? You don't deserve *this*."
"Politically I agree with your wife (am a guy FWIW). Beauty pageants are almost exclusively female focused (where are the men's rights folks demanding a male version lol). They tend to objectify people, yadda yadda yadda. I would not be thrilled if my own daughter wanted to participate in this.

All that said, you really didn't do anything wrong. Your daughter is 17 and she has some right and say in the activities she wants to do. Instead of limiting her agency as a teenager, your wife should be looking at this as a teachable moment. Let her go, but talk about what it means to participate in something like this. What's important to your daughter right now? What kind of long term goals does she have? What's important to her, and how does this pageant line up with all that? What kind of values does this kind of event emphasize? 

Teenagers engage in all sorts of questionable behavior from laziness to excessive video game playing to alcohol and drugs, to unprotected sex, and even beauty pageants. I would argue that parents need to arm their kids with as much critical thinking and initiative as they can so these kids are better prepared to handle situations that will be impossible for parents to control later. Yes, you could make her not go to this pageant but that doesn't help her deal with the next situation that you won't know about or aren't around. 

Wife needs to get a handle on her understandable reaction and turn it into something more constructive in her relationship with her daughter.

The challenge is convincing her. Good luck OP. You sound like a fair guy."
"I cannot tell you how much I loathe the concept of ""work husband/wife."" It's pretty much always an excuse for married people to have an emotional affair in plain sight. And no offense but your wife seems like an idiot to think that she could blow kisses to another man in front of all her coworkers under the impression that no one is gonna think that's weird. Is she generally naive in other ways? Because that's just dense. And, frankly, unprofessional for someone in HR.

You're not paranoid. She has admitted having a crush on a man she spends a ton of time with whose marriage is in trouble. It's only a matter of time. In my opinion she's already cheating.

Maybe you should ask her to figure out a way to not have to work so closely with him and at the very least not spend all her free work time like lunch with him.  "
"""noone will want him as a student"" is re-engaging in the negotiation, and kind of a mis-step (because it sounds like you're attacking her bargaining position), but it sounds like you did good overall.

I would acknowledge ""he's a bright kid and can make good progress, but we don't haggle over prices for stuff like this here"" to shut it down."
This is an utterly ridiculous idea and it's hilarious that he would go to these lengths to impress a few thousand random people online.
"Why wouldn't you tell him? He's your fiancé, right? Wouldn't you want to know if he found it painful, or you had a weird odor that turned him off? 

Go see an OB GYN. Tell them what's happening. "
Thanks for freaking me out haha. Now all I can picture is a shrine and a doll made of my hair... which is impressive since I'm pretty bald.
Oh god I hope so. Like Ryan gosling hot.
"It's been a month since you graduated. You're fine. I have an engineering degree but I never had a co-op or internship, and I didn't get a job until almost 5 months after I graduated. Some of my classmates had jobs set up before they even started their last semester, others didn't have jobs until half a year after graduating. As long as you're willing to relocate, you shouldn't really have any issues with a GPA over 3.0. If you're not in immediate need of money, you don't need  a part-time job right now."
Staying late talking to him and going outside with him etc. She would have been aware he was into her and let it happen. She sounds like an asshole. 
"&gt;Is this the same bf that said he doesn't love you in your other post about 5 months ago?

According to a comment on that (deleted) post, he also called her a whore and a bitch.. Not sure about context but it's definitely a red flag. 

OP, you're 19. Give yourself a few more years to make sure this is what you want. "
"Yeah, there is no simple solution to a complex mental disease. 

My fiancee is now two years sober, and I stuck with her through shit that from the outside I would've called myself a fucking idiot for.

The issue is, when you're an addict there's two people. There's the addict, and there's who the person is. When you know what kind of person is hiding behind this evil addict side of them, it's so hard to just abandon them and leave them to their devices, even though that's the right answer sometimes. It's an addiction to save an addict, and we as supporters need to remember to keep ourselves above the bullshit, and only help in ways that are productive towards their sobriety.

I feel for OP, I've had nights like that, wondering where they are, who they're with, if they're safe, if they're alive, daydreaming that it's all a big misunderstanding, thinking up every possible thing they could be doing other than drugs, but at the end of the day, it's always drugs. Drugs control their every thought, action and word. Everything is either a short or long con to get what they're craving. Until they're months or even years away from the drug, they're not ok.

I was talking to my girlfriend the other day about an incident when she was only a couple months sober and someone came in her work, they reeked of smoked pills which was what she was hooked on. I remember the texts were becoming scatterbrained to me, she was talking about weird shit that involved money that didn't make any sense, it was the addict in her taking over. I ended up getting her to come straight home, where she curled up in a ball and cried for a few hours, just completely overwhelmed by the inability to control her thought process. 

That story came up because she had a similar instance here recently, a couple years later, someone obviously high out of their mind, reeking of that smell that she obsessed over for so long, and she said all she did was pity the guy. 

Two years ago, she thought she was ruined and would never be able to happily live a sober life, she never thought she could be a functional human again, but it just took all this time away from those substances and those people that she had been running with, and now she's able to face shit like that with a clear mind, with her true mind and not her addict mind.

I'm sure I'm rambling and off topic, but I just wanted to add this story to try and open some of these people that have never been close to this shit's eyes. This isn't what these people want, even the people that act completely content and angrily lash out against any idea of sobriety, are completely miserable people inside, their brains are simply rewired to the point they can't imagine a possible life that's without their substance. It's heartbreaking to see this happen over and over, the more people that truly understand addiction, and sympathize with it, rather than admonish it, the better chance we have of helping some of these people. "
"No, this is a wise decision. Perfectly acceptable"
"Just stay civil and be calm if she starts attacking you. Tell her the truth that you deleted the picture and then end the conversation. If she wants to make a scene and a fool out of herself in public, that's on her. Don't feed into the drama. "
"My mom collapsed in the middle of the night.  It was a miracle my dad heard her fall.  3 days later they declared her brain dead.  I knew there was no hope and had spent the 3 days getting everything ready.  I informed the hospital that my mother was an organ donor and to run her for matches.  The funeral, wake, viewing got it all lined up so the rest of my family literally had nothing to do but pick out colors.  Totally numb, cold and analytical.  

Lasted like that until the wake.  Then I had a complete meltdown.  The first year was really rough.  I was very spacey, distracted just not planning.  I got better but it took a lot of time.  Still miss her.

Not everyone gets this but I was REALLY angry.  Angry she wasn't here. Angry because I needed her. Angry that there was no reason, nothing to blame, no warning.  Turned out it was a rare congenital defect. Doctor said the thing he couldn't explain to us was how she lived so long. Most people with her condition never see 30.

This is a long, hard slog in front of you.  Be kind to yourself. 

And the organ donation? Thank you for doing that.  You have literally spared other people from what you are going through now.  The letters we got from the recipients were mind blowing.  My mom would have loved to know she helped so many families."
"Dude, you can excuse his behavior and actions all you want, but I can tell you right now that he thinks he's entitled to women. That's why he's pissed you got with his friend, because she didn't get with him. He can't figure out WHY. 

It's because he want A woman so bad that he is no longer viewing and treating women as individuals and as humans. That's why any woman who gets with you is ""damaged,"" according to him. Because a woman who is in control of her own life, including her sex life, must be damaged if they don't see his value, right? 

He's bitter, and that is as unattractive as hell. "
"So, he thinks it would be too awkward for you to talk to your/his friends, but that it's also too awkward when you don't show up? And he then dismisses your feelings by saying you're being oversensitive? This is very patronizing behavior. It sounds like what he is telling you to do is be a good little girl and don't make waves because it makes HIM uncomfortable. The social situation changed in a way that negatively affected you and you have the right to address this in a way you feel is right for you. Let your husband know what your plan is and then let him deal with his discomfort. He's a grown man, you're not responsible for managing his emotions.
Edit: words"
What if she had died during surgery? I cannot believe how selfish and dimmwitted you are. You need to seriously consider everyone's comments here because you need to seriously cut the cord with your sister. Inviting her on vacations with you? Late for dates ? Come on man. 
"Romance and love are nouns for the early stages of a relationship. At some point, though, they turn into verbs. You need to work to maintain feelings of romance. You need to BE romantic. Are you actively pursuing romantic activities? Is being romantic top of mind for you? "
"Actually, there's a good way to do this that might help him realize that he's not prioritizing things well.

Sit him down, and ask him to make a list of things that are important to him, in order of importance. So like, 1 might be you, 2 might be his job, 3 might be the gym, whatever. It doesn't have to be everything in his life, just the most important things.

Then have him make a second list, which is the amount of waking hours he spends on things, in order of how much time he spends on them (and be sure to have him write the average number of hours there). If you want to be fair, you can specify 'waking hours that are not spent at a job', since job time would probably be number 1 on that list regardless of his feelings.

Then the two of you can compare those lists and see if you two are happy with those results. And if you're not (which I am sure you won't be), then you can have that conversation about how you are unhappy with how much time he spends at the gym. It's important for you to say how you feel, but when someone's vice is a 'good activity' like working out, it's hard to get them to realize that it's a problem if they don't come to that conclusion on their own."
"Sorry.

Can I offer a slightly different take on this?

Your dad had options throughout your life. His parental rights were established (child support) and he did not seek those legal options. He, apparently, had time to get remarried but not seek out to enforce visitation in those decades. If a woman says ""no, you can't see your kids"", many men go to a courthouse and file an order. Yours didn't, apparently.

When it comes to these situations, there are always two sides to a story. Obviously, your mother has not been telling the truth about some things, but your dad isn't innocent here either.

Divorce does nasty things to people. Your parents are both human and have obviously made mistakes, whether or not you want to forgive it is up to you."
Honey the relationships is not healthy at all. Go to your family or friends or somewhere else and break up with him. For your own good sweety. Love is not excuse for putting up this kind of behavior. You are better than this :)
That's a phenomenal compromise.
"Same. 

I think it's worthwhile at this point to mention from a medical standpoint....maybe he's juicing? Steroids and going into the cutting/off cycle phase can cause big drops in testosterone and can kill a man's sex drive as well. I wonder if he's going beyond your basic protein shakes and things and this is more of a medical issue at this point? 

Edit: I clearly didn't phrase this right. I'm talking about cycling off of steroids and losing sex drive from T decreases. Someone mentioned that he'd have to be the ""worst steroid user"" ever to fuck this up. Uh, yeah. Did you read the rest of the post? Clearly this guy has no idea what he's doing and is going way overboard with everything. "
"I am sitting good financially, it isn't breaking my bank account by any means. My thoughts are, if the other girls/her friends don't have the extra $150 to shell out then they shouldn't even be coming on the trip. Today is my last day to cancel the hotel in full without any penalties. "
"Thank you so much. I agree with everything that you've said

I knew that I was acting like a bit of a brat and I knew that my feelings were sort of irrational. I just wanted to hear what other people thought as well. It also helps me challenge my skewed way of thinking sometimes, which I think is good, because hearing all of these perspectives that I otherwise would never be exposed to kind of helps me grow as a person and helps me take a lot of things into consideration

Thank you again &lt;3 "
"&gt; You're not forbidding her from getting back with him. You're just stating what you will do if she does.

Adding to this.  OP is removing himself from the drama that he knows is going to happen, even if not directly, when he abuses her, or cheats on her, that she comes crying back to OP."
"Without the part about being gay, he's just another man that cheated on his spouse. It's probably the most devastating that OP's kids don't even side with you at all even though their dad was too chicken to tell them the truth. "
"Well. You have a long history together and turning to him for emotional support is not entirely verboten. But. He's engaged. In my opinion, what should have happened when he became seriously involved with someone else, is that your boundaries should have changed - him being in your bedroom while you're changing is not okay, and I imagine if his fiance knew about it, she'd be rightfully upset. You interacting with him physically while seeking emotional comfort is really toeing the line of acceptable. You both knew what you were doing. It sounds like you haven't fully disengaged from your ex. Therapy might help."
"&gt;I am sorry I don't see this at all in my personal life.

"Wow, it's hard to imagine how your timing could have been worse. Three weeks after getting married was the time for you to suggest that you start work again on a hobby that lead to you sneaking, lying, and risking your career? No wonder your wife is pissed. 

I understand artistic passion and being excited about a project, but the way you've described this hobby sounds extremely self-destructive. The fact that you refrained from doing this hobby for a year but felt compelled to bring it up immediately after the wedding looks like self-sabotage to me. I would highly recommend finding a therapist to discuss this with. I think this project is working as a bit of escapism for you, and the way you're using it is incredibly destructive. There might have been a time for you to suggest working on it again, but mere weeks after a wedding was certainly not that time. "
"I just called him to talk and he framed this as me choosing to betray him and my stepson because I refused to stay in a hotel with them when we are supposed to be spending a week with my newly retired father. He's making it seem like I chose my dad above them. In reality my dad pointing out the anger issues just compounds with all the other problems I've been having. He just said ""well we could have worked on those problems but you blew it by choosing your dad."" Guess that's the new narrative. Also, he has explicitly refused to seek treatment for his problems in the past."
She's going to need an attorney at some point.
"An abusive, controlling person who is checking up on his gf to make sure she is in bed alone were spending the evening away from him. You know the type: ""I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd swing by (to check up on you )."""

"I'm glad you got a therapist, this sounds like it was above reddit's pay grade from the beginning.

It occurs to me though: it would be fair game in normal families for the working homeowner to ask the stay-at-home relative to make/stock their favorite food, so a ""if you're going to be shopping for food and cooking here, please make sure my pickles, granola and soy milk is always stocked fresh"" type request is actually ok.

You may be able to tackle the ""my food gets thrown out"" problem one better by making it her problem to stock your food."
"Your sister is still your family.  However, from the moment you proposed, she became your secondary family.  Your wife and eventual children will always have to come before your sister.  Full stop.  If your sister and wife are dying in the hospital at the same time, you go to your wife.  How does it look to your future spouse that you left her on the operating table to help your sister's poor party experience?  

She is thinking about how you will prioritize everything from here on out, not just the surgery.  Will you pick up your kids from school on time, or go get groceries for your sister?  Will you get your wife prescriptions from the store when she's sick, or will you ignore her and take your sister to get ice cream instead?  

What isn't being talked about is how rude your sister was being by asking you to pick her up when SHE KNEW you had a massive surgery coming up.  That is incredibly inconsiderate, and should to be talked about."
"So...stop yourself?  I don't get what you're looking for here?  If you don't want to cheat, don't cheat, it's really not that hard to understand.  I am going to agree with the others who have said just don't go because you seem really ready to use this trip as an excuse to cheat."

"The childbirth comment was totally unnecessary and the women's response to it was hilarious. The brat comment is a bit of a grey area. Some parents don't like any derogatory language used in reference to their kids, some are only ok with using it amongst themselves, and some are fine with a free for all. A good way to look at it is this: How would you feel if they said that you were being a brat (or a stronger word) by buying their kids toys without checking first? Not very good I bet. 

But the buying stuff without permission and/or resenting them saying no... You are 120% in the wrong for that. They are in charge of nutrition and discipline. They have to deal with the consequences of a toddler hyped up on sugar who expects a new toy or treat every time company comes. They get to make that call. If you do this sort of thing often it may explain the husband's behavior. He could (in his own shitty passive aggressive way) be trying to tell you that they're the parents, not you."
"&gt; He doesn't see you that way so he wants to hurt you badly enough that you'll never mention it again.

"That is stalking. The fact she was taunting her son while stalking him is disturbing. See if Tim can talk to his mom and let her know that while she is his mom.and he understands she's concerned, it's crossing a line. 

There's not a lot you can do sadly. "
"Somebody once told me, ""Refusing, on principle, to like something because it's popular, is as mindless as participating and liking things because  they're popular."" It kind of stuck with me."
I'd break up with him.  I can understand banging on the door.  Can't abide him breaking in.
"Solid checklist. 


What does the TLDR stand for? "
"I was widowed pretty young (early 30s), and this is very true to my experience. I've been with my current, entirely wonderful, boyfriend for about 2 1/2 years, and until a few months ago, whenever I mentioned him on the phone with my parents, they'd just stop the conversation and hang up (and my parents HATED my husband, until I started dating again after he'd died, and suddenly they were his biggest retroactive fans). My old friends, I found, didn't want to hear about anything that happened in my life after my husband died. Many of them weren't actively mean about it, they just didn't want to acknowledge that I could possibly have any life after he died. It really hurt, and continues to hurt. I ended a lot of friendships when I realized what was going on, but I didn't really have any time for their shit. I was too busy moving on with my life.

Shutting down the negativity requires setting boundaries and then enforcing them. You are going to end a lot of phone conversations and leave a lot of parties/visits/restaurants until people realize you are serious, and you are probably going to lose some friends. 

The guilt about being happy again is one of those things that is probably going to be best worked on with your therapist, but it can be done.

This is a thing that happens, you are not alone, you are not wrong about it, and it's awful of your family and friends to be doing."
What. The. Fuck.  I can't even imagine how you sat through that without blowing up.  I think you need to talk to your dad about this- tell him how it made you feel and ask him if he really thinks it's okay to be friends with racists.  I'm in my 50's and that wouldn't have been okay even back in the dark ages when I was a kid.  You dad should have stood up for you and he was either too cowardly or was blind to the offensiveness of the situation.  Neither of these scenarios are good.  
"Honestly, this is a) ridiculous, and b) something you need to talk to your BF about - has she ever acted like this before?

Beyond that, all you can say is ""I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable, but I won't dress or act differently when I was completely appropriate."""
"So basically, you were willing to make a pretty painless, easy concession to make your ex happy, but not your current partner?"
"No wonder neither of you didn't like the water. Did she freak out like this all the time in your childhood? This is Helicopter Parent to the max. Not normal at all.

You can't control her actions, only yours. Tell her to chill out, joke around with other people about what happened, but let her have her little pity party. Everyone knows she is being crazy."
I’m really surprised by all the comments defending him. It was so blatantly disrespectful that it’d be something I’d want to talk to him about outside of the bedroom to make sure it wasn’t going to happen again. 
"I know right, he's acting like he's the damn ceo of apple right now "
"Even a step further, teach your daughter how to avoid sexual assault at parties. My boyfriend's teenage sister just got raped at a party ~~because~~ when she was trashed and partially because her friends ditched her (yes i blame them - they know who raped her and are refusing to say who it was). Teach your daughter to have trustworthy buddies, pre-arranged before the party. Know her limits - don't get too drunk. Always watch her drink. Another friend of mine just got roofied last week, but luckily was with a group of friends who took care of her. (Though I want to point out it should really be the responsibility of the men not to rape women, but here we are)"
"They ask you because you always say ""yes"".

My guess is that they don't ask your brother because he  said ""no"". 

Try it some time. 

Tell them you need them gone so you can start on your own family. Nobody's gonna wanna marry you and breed (assuming that's what you want) if you are supporting these parasites. I can't imagine why you are."
"I don't think you should use it as leverage, but certainly take a lesson from it.  Don't rely on an authority to tell you what's right or wrong, bc who knows what fucked up shit they've done.  I think you'll come to relate to your parents more as equals, or simply as people.  You're going to have a different perspective when they try to guide you or ""parent"" you.  But that happens to all adults someday.  It just happened quickly and painfully in this case.  
   
I'd have a real talk with them about it, because you're going to react differently to them now and it will cause friction.  You don't want this coming out during a fight."

"Yes, as a father, your daughter's needs comes before the gf's.  If she's a nanny and is jealous of 5 y.o., time for her to go. Your daughter shouldn't be damaged by this woman's insecurity."

Medical professional here. Which condition is that supposed to be? 
"Your dad is a racist. There's no surprise he's okay with other racists. I understand the struggle, I am also half-asian with a racist white father. Marrying an asian doesn't mean you aren't racist, it's the asian version of the having a black friend excuse. I first looked upon my father as just joking around but as time goes on, the receipts just stack up.

Unfortunately, it's acceptable to make fun of asians in the US. You'd lose your job and can be deemed racist for making race jokes targeting blacks or latinos, but asians are always fair game. All you can do is excise these racists from your life, including your shitbag dad."
"This, this, this.

The mom has spent six years of her life focused on her daughter and shepherding her through tender years. No matter how you slice it, the mom has paid her dues. She's more than earned the right to make a call about her own employment, even if that is not what was expected.

Not only that, but there is something to be said for fostering independence in both the mother AND the child at this point. The extra income can pay for child care, the mom can feel self-actualized, and even if she doesn't stick with the dispatcher position she can still make use of her teaching certificate if she wants to. Nothing mentioned here would prevent her from doing that."
They're of an age where you shouldn't have to have that much contact with their mother to maintain a relationship with them. Maybe step back from the parenting role and move into cool uncle territory?
I like this response. You did a good job of validating OP's feelings while transitioning to a healthy outlook on the situation.  
"You need to seriously evaluate your own mindset about all of this.  By asking your girlfriend to marry you were telling her that she would come first in your life. Let's say the cards were reversed and your sister was in the hospital having surgery and your fiancé got drunk how would you have felt or acted? My guess is you would have stayed with your sister and been mad at your fiancé which is where the problem lies. 


I went through similar growing pains with my husband. He is the oldest of four children and by far has the best work ethic of any of them. They were used to being able to call on him to bail them out of financial trouble and it took a lot of tough conversations and hurt feelings for them to begin to understand he has other priorities in his life now and cannot be responsible for their poor decisions any longer. "
I'm glad you stood up for yourself! 
"Education is the way out of poverty. Go to school. 
It sounds like your sister knows this as well."
"I'm just a little bit in, but already it's so relatable. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD from my last birth experience (again, a long story) and stuff like this really helps me process my experiences, so thank you! Even if he doesn't read it, I'll make use of it!"
"Never, never be alone with him again.  Cut contact, block him on everything, and tell your friends and family that you don't feel safe around him.

You ever wondered how people end up being abused for years on end?  This exact kind of situation.  This is one of those red flags that abuse victims look back on and say ""why didn't I just leave then?"" and the answer is that they decided it was just a small thing and that they can get over it.  The next time it will be something else, something a little worse.  And then you'll say ""well I didn't make a big deal last time, and this time was just a little worse, so I shouldn't make a big deal this time."" 
"
Uh who drops off stuff at 3:30 am?
"You're totally handling this fairly. Life is too short to spend time with people whose major upsides are ""breathing and in the same general area."" 

Side note: I'm pretty happy the snake bit her lol"
"Please tell your parents. There are so many variables at play here, you need real legal advice, if nothing else.

If you're the father of her baby, she might change her mind demand child support later on. She might break up with her boyfriend and need a place for *your* kid to sleep. Or the kid might decide to track you down someday, and then you'll have to explain to your parents/future wife why you have a 20-year-old daughter that nobody knew about. You need adults on your side, protecting your interests. Internet strangers are not a substitute.

Having a secret child (or any major secret) is like leaving a bomb under your couch. Yeah, it might never go off, and nobody would ever have to know it's there... but it could also explode at any moment and blow up your entire life. And you'll have to live with knowing it's there, every single day. Even if you have no contact with this kid in the near future, if you make his/her existence your deepest, darkest secret, you risk having it bite you in the ass later, when you have a lot more to lose."

"I had something kinda similar happen to me this year. My dad basically started searching for women online while still married and when he found someone he liked he travelled to her country while my mother was in vacation back home where I am (they are both immigrants). Then he proceeded to tell me and my sister where he actually was (he had been lying the whole time) and waited a long time to tell my mother and ask for a divorce. He basically did all of this by calling us on separate occasions while he was visiting his new girlfriend. I stopped all contact with him and blocked his number because I don't think I can forgive him.

I understand the guilt you're feeling about hurting the other woman, but you shouldn't rush into forgiving your father. He obviously didn't go about it the right way and there is nothing that would guarantee that he wouldn't do the same to his new girlfriend. Allow yourself time to heal."
"Once I was at an LGBT panel at school and a transgender woman on the panel was asked if her parents had learned to accept her as a woman or what her relationship was with them. She said something that has always stuck with me.

""It took them a while to get used to the idea and to reform the way they thought of me. Some people might criticize my parents for not totally understanding and embracing me from the start, but I think sometimes that is a heavy expectation. I spent the first twenty years of my life trying to understand and reform my identity. So if I spend so long myself trying to figure it out, how could I expect my parents to figure it out instantly? They spent their entire lives thinking of me as a straight son, and now I'm asking them to think of me as a lesbian daughter. 

I never asked them to understand me right away, but I did ask them to open their hearts, respect my identity, and support me no matter what. And hey always did.""

You don't need to instantly understand your son's newly announced identity. Despite what some people say, it is normal to feel awkward about it or have a hard time changing the way you see him and his relationships. But what is absolutely unacceptable is your wife's treatment of him. You don't have to understand someone to love and respect them.  

You're going to lose your son forever if your wife doesn't stop or if you don't leave her. What she's doing to him will do so much damage. There's a reason why LGBT individuals have such a high rate of homelessness and mental illness. 

I personally could never be with a partner who put
my child at that risk just for being who they are. Religion is no excuse. Jesus never preached to verbally abuse people. No where in the New Testament does he even mention sexuality. She's homophobic, plain and simple. And *you are going to lose your son because of it.*

I encourage you to reconsider your marriage and reach out to your son and tell him you love and support him.
"
"Alternatively, if Dad doesn't let up, ""Yes, he is my brother, which is why I still have a relationship with him. Were he anyone else I would have cut him out immediately. Stop pushing me on this."""
"This actually changes the situation quite a bit for me personally. This combined with constantly talking about his ""poo"", I would probably break up with him. Someone who doesn't take good care of their health, whines about it, then does nothing to change it is not someone I want to be with. This combined with an annoying habit and a poor reaction to you telling him to stop... at 28 he should be doing better. "
Spot on. And an ugly personality can make someone who's average uglier. He sounds like he believes he's entitled to sex. Attitudes like that don't go far with many women.
"Damn. Comparisons like that are often arguments in the making.

*But his response was ridiculously disproportionate.*

His first instinct was to immediately toss that symbol of the relationship away. Damn. I don't know if there's any coming back from that. There might be counseling ahead, and that is well advised, but the sting of this is not going to go away.

I think it's fair to be upset having those comparisons made. But his reaction was extreme, so much that I don't see a future here.

"&gt;1) If my partner's mother shows up, what do I do and say?

You don't say anything to her. You call the police and ask them to remove her. 

&gt;2) If my partner decides to ""make an appearance"", is there anyone here from a South Asian background, who has dealt with similar problems with parents and cultural division, who has successfully set boundaries with their families?

The first thing to understand is that it is incredibly unlikely that his parents will ever change. If he really feels inclined to confront them (which I think is a bad idea, tbh) then he needs to be prepared with a list of boundaries and expectations, as well as consequences for violating them. The two of you should sit down and decide what is and isn't acceptable behavior from his parents, and what you will do if they break your rules. And OP, you're going to need to be a little patient with him in this, because he's probably going to slip into his old dynamic more than once before he grows a spine and learns to confront them. 

He really needs a therapist, no question. I understand why you're looking for one with a specific background in his culture, but there really is no shortage of therapists who deal with overbearing, controlling, and super-religious parents. 

What troubles me though is his name being on the deed and their supposed money troubles. His credit could be tanking if they're not paying for anything on the property. You should post the details of that to r/personalfinance and/or r/legaladvice to make sure he's not going to pay for that later. "
"There are so many posts about ""harmless pranks"" that are actually incredibly nasty and cruel, so I came into this expecting to read about something really horrible.... but this was *actually* harmless!  So I think your family's reaction sounds like you accidentally hit a sore spot.  

I wonder if your cousin's parents are sensitive about the fact that she's growing up.  A belly button ring has ""sexy"" implications to some people, so maybe even the fake one was an unwelcome reminder to your cousin's parents that she's not a little girl anymore.  Or, maybe your own parents feel foolish that their children got one over on them, and their anger is coming from stung pride.  I mean ultimately those emotions are on *them* to manage and I'm not defending their choice to stop speaking to you.  But I would give them some time to cool off and then apologize for upsetting them.  I don't think you did anything grievously wrong but if an apology would smooth over the ruffled feathers, that's the way to go.
"
"This would be incredibly frustrating and upsetting, sorry you have to deal with this. 

They are bitter and jealous. They are insecure. 

Time to branch out and make new friends with coworkers.

Best advice for new job is do ALL THE THINGS. Taco tuesday after work? GO. Joe having a BBQ this weekend? GO.

Say yes to all these things. "
"Generally if one party makes more, it's a good idea to split the bills proportionately- so if you make 2x as much as her, it'd be like 70-30 with you paying more (or the equivalent split, math isn't my strong point.)  so it isn't necessarily unreasonable for her to not want to split 50-50 but it IS unreasonable to demand the more expensive place and to demand you pay all the rent.  


What you did with your ex has no bearing- it was a completely different circumstance and I'm also willing to bet if the apartment was $600 this time around you'd be more open to paying it all or paying like 80%.  Currently she's sounding very spoiled and entitled and her friends are reinforcing that.  If she doesn't see reason I'd be seriously rethinking moving in together.  "
"It's very common for teenage girls to develop crushes on older guys and to try flirting with. Especially if they view him as a ""safe way to experiment with feeling sexual attraction"" (you showed you care about her, you are unavailable so she doesn't actually have to risk having a relationship). 
But do get a nanny cam. Look into recording rights in your country (you don't want to be charged with recording someone without their consent). Tell your wife you feel uncomfortable to the point you want a camera. And talk to the girl about what is appropriate boundaries. And when she comes over make sure to create space between you guys, shut down any flirting. Be the adult. "
"&gt; It is hard not to help her when she is in trouble though.

Drunk at a party isn't ""in trouble."" Your wife having emergency surgery is. Do you still not get that? Are you in denial? A 20 year old drunk at a party is not an emergency that you need to drop things for. Your wife getting emergency surgery in the hospital is. "

"If you want to bring it up as frictionlessly as possible and you're the kind of people to joke about being broke, you could tie it to that - ""Hey (cousin), I think we had a misunderstanding about the car - no way we're rich enough to give it away for free, haha! We're looking for $X for it. If that's not something you're interested in, no worries we'll just scrap it!""

The key is to make it lighthearted and give him an easy out."
"And don't just apologize -- *thank her*. She tried to help you, and she should know that you're grateful in retrospect even though it didn't work."
"What the?  This is unreasonable, bordering on psychotic.  

Yes, this is a big deal, and I think anyone with self-respect would consider this breakup-worthy.  Sorry to be blunt!"
"The truth is that you are only ready to stay in a relationship if you are also ready to leave the relationship.

It may seem counterintuitive, but it's the truth. You see, a person is only ready to be in a relationship if they're able to respect themselves, know their limits, be well with themself, emotionally balanced, and a whole person, able to recognize their own worth and be able to act independently. A relationship is something that ""adds"" to your life and expands it, not something that fills an emptiness, or a need.

Therefore, a balanced person is always prepared to leave a relationship. It doesn't mean that he wants to, or that he needs to - but he can do it, if necessary. Read what you said about her. Is this really a person who should be by your side? What if it was the girlfriend of a brother of yours, or a great friend who had done with him what she had done to you... Would you tell them to continue in the relationship?"
"Yep, I zeroed in on that too. It's her insecurity playing havok with her. I think it's a natural instinct to want to be better than the last partner but she feels she can't compete in looks. It's clear though that her fiance finds her attractive and should be happy with that. "
"""The topic of the wedding came up and the other person asked:""What about the daughter situation"" to which Maria replied ""I still don't want her there. It's gonna be my day and I will not let her steal it away from me"". Her being, my sister.""

Regardless, I'd tell your dad. I guess I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt because you were originally happy for your father to marry her.

ETA: I saw the response that she confirmed it was your sister she meant, and that you've emailed your dad. I'm hoping for best for you, OP, good luck!"
"Your beef is with your supervisor or manager who does the schedule. Not with K.

If K asked not to be booked on Saturdays and was booked anyway, then your manager fucked this up. You have to communicate with your employees if you aren't going to honour a time-off request. If K asked for the Saturdays off, and the manager told her that wasn't possible or that the policy didn't allow her to do that, then your beef *is still with your manager* who is the one needs to deal with K's failure to be a responsible employee and make her scheduled shifts.

Talk to your supervisor. K didn't act like your friend when she bailed on her shift, but that doesn't actually matter. She isn't really your friend, is she? She's just your coworker and when you have an issue like this with a co-worker, you take it up the ladder. "

"I'd probably look for other friends or at least don't confide in him. Honestly he sounds like what I like to call an ""Emotional Vacationer"". Emotional Vacationer's enjoy having people confide in them, enjoy the thought of ""I'm such a good person"" it brings, but in reality don't want the inconvenience, the negativity to effect them in any way, or amount of effort it requires.

&gt;""I think you should get breast implants and I'll help you pay for them, I'll get more horny when I bleep you if you have implants.""

"This is the best advice. When friends start careers, it's common to discuss starting salaries for informational purposes. But often in time some friends surge ahead and some fall behind. 

It's better to dial back the sharing because the gap is likely to increase. And once that kind of info is shared, it cannot be unshared. It can cause really hard feelings. It's just part of growing up, you'll eventually have info you'll share only with your SO, not your parents or friends. 

And remember, you lose control of information once you share it. There's nothing to stop your salary from becoming the topic of conversation outside your control, in a way that can come back to bite you.

"&gt; I try not to ask too many questions about their finances because I feel like that’s not my place, but it seems like she is living off of them.

Actually, if you do want to build a life together, it is your place.  You've said you've talked about it multiple times, but it sounds like you have only talked in generalities.  It's time to talk specifics...concrete plans, timelines, tangible goals.  Not ""I want to finish my degree"", but ""I will save 3K next year by working part time next year which will go towards helping me pay for my first semester of tuition.  I will be majoring in education because I am good with kids.  When I get to school, child care will be taken care of with method X,Y,Z.""  Do you see the difference?

You have to frame the discussion about achieving goals and not about sacrificing time with her child.  Focus on the positive but at the same time, you have to tell her how you feel.  That's how discussing the future works."
Why did you lie about the logistics? This is key to the best advice I can give you. It is important that your honest with yourself here with this question. 
"You can have a good friendship connection without having a long, drawn-out history. Sometimes people just click and the time frame is meaningless because the friendship is there.

"It's so common that my Indian boyfriend assured me within two weeks of dating that he would never have an arranged marriage, and within two months suggested that I listen to him tell his parents about me (in English) on the phone.

Edit: his parents aren't pleased, but they seem mostly concerned that any kids we have speak their language and be nominally Hindu "
"You need to learn how to be okay with setting boundaries, saying no, and letting him be upset.

&gt; For example, he'll buy us both concert tickets with his friends to a band I don't even like or know then expect me to buy the food/drinks because he bought the tickets.

""SO, I appreciate you thinking of me, but I do not want to go to that concert. In the future please ask me before spending money on an event I may not want or be able to attend. Why don't we see if we can find someone else to take my ticket?""

&gt; He'll sign me up for camping with his friends then expect me to pay my fair share of the costs without even asking me if I want to go first. Most of the time I really don't even want to go.

""SO, I'm sorry but I'm not interested in attending. Please ask me before signing me up for an event.""

&gt; He invites his friends over then wants me to split the bill with him when he needs to get groceries to host people over.

""SO, if you invite your friends over then you need to budget for the groceries to host them. I did not have a part in the decision to have them over, I do not owe anything to cover their visit.""

&gt; However, most of the time he gets upset if I decline his ""invitation."" Sometimes he will go as far as canceling the plans altogether so I look like the bad guy who ruined their fun weekend.

""SO, it is normal and healthy for us to have individual interests and alone time. I am more than happy for you to go enjoy time with your friends. I will not be joining you on this occasion.""

Everything you have described is intensely controlling and manipulative, whether he means it to be or not. You don't get a say in your own life, and you're constantly paying for things you don't want. And if you stand up for yourself, he gets butthurt and makes it your fault. 

So you start with lines like this. Firm no's. Reminders that he didn't consult you before making a decision. If he tries to make it your fault, or make it like you're keeping him from his fun, you have to make it clear to him that HE is keeping himself from having fun. 

And if he keeps being a total twatwaffle about it, then you need to leave. "
"My cat died about three weeks ago. I get how you feel. 

Mourn. You lost a family member. 

This is controversial advice, but worked for me: adopt another cat (or two!). Give yourself a some time to grieve, but get a new furry friend in your life. 

It's made it so I see my cat's passing as not just sad, but happy that I know that he's allowed me to bring more love into my life. I've only had my two girls for about two weeks, but I'm already much happier (not then I was with Tambi, my previous cat, but differently happier - couldn't stand not having someone to come home to) and love them very much. "
"Yeah so there's a few red flags here. 

Just before anything else, know that it can easily take up to a year to naturally conceive so you're well within normal. 

1. Lying to you about the purpose of a trip is concerning. 

2. Not being upfront about visiting adoption agencies is concerning. 

3. Acting like something else is going on during the phonecall is concerning. 

4. Lying to his friend is concerning. 

Suffice to say, lots of things about this story are concerning. When he gets home you need to confront him completely with all that you know. There is a slim chance he can explain it away adequately. Otherwise, you need to STRONGLY consider if this is the guy you want to marry given that he is being so dishonest with you. "
Right ? If this is a true story she must be under a spell or something. Magic is the only way I can explain this.
You are *allowed* to do whatever you want to do. 
"To be honest, with a baby on the way you e got bigger issues to deal with re:your mother than who plans a shower. This woman is toxic and abusive, and will treat your child the way she did/does you. Please go to see a psychologist and work through this stuff."
Aw! Is that what her cheating husband told you? 
[deleted]
"She has the right to ask.  You have the right to decline.

She says ""it's only fair,"" which is the wrong tack to take.  However, the real issue here is the lack of generosity you are extending toward her --a generosity you managed with your ex-girlfriend.

I find this so odd that it's bordering on selfishness and a bit of callousness.  So the question left is why?  Why don't you _want_ to give her this experience?  Is it safety-related?  Was it a special sentimental experience you had with your ex that you don't want your current girlfriend to encroach upon?  Is it because you're territorial/guarded about your solo activities?  Is it something else?
  Because there is definitely something missing in your account of this to us."
THIS. Do not forget for a SECOND that his behavior is intentional.
"You have a wife problem not an inlaw problem.

She should be able to control them, if it is her who is having an issue she should communicate that to you.

She is probably venting to them, then bring back whatever they said back to you."
"Someone like your stepmother isn't going to broach the topic in a straightforward way. She will fabricate some offense to accuse your sister of, and use the tension to manipulate your father into banning the daughter himself. In other words, she won't make a fool of herself, but of your dad.

Give him a heads up before she starts her game."
"You're completely right. Your husband is disgusting and has zero respect for you.  

I wish I could offer advice on what to say but I just don't know how to talk to someone who would do such a thing to anyone, let alone their wife. I am fucking livid on your behalf. "
"That kinda sucks, but does it make any sense to you that he would be getting served for divorce now?  You say they were separated and getting divorced from the beginning.  Sounds to me like they were only separated and he lied to you.

Also, how did your boyfriend get served while he's overseas?  

Something doesn't add up here."
"Don't bring up all that shit about groceries and food, just be clear and direct.  ""Hey, BF and I are planning on him moving in when the lease is up in Dec.  I just wanted to give you plenty of time to start looking.  Also, it's not fair to me when you don't pay your share of the rent.  I need you to start paying the rent regularly.  I can help you open a bank account if you want."""
"If none of the above are successful, monotonously replying to their comments with complete apathy might help them get the message:

""It's been what, half a decade? [Name], stop wasting my time; I have important things to do.""

""Sorry, I have a strict policy on not dating exes.""

""My romantic relationships are not your concern.""

""That's not my problem."" &amp;ndash; *If they try to guilt trip you.*"
"The thing that's most baffling about this story, and the only argument I see even for giving him a chance to explain before breaking up with him, is that he had to have known there was a good chance that OP would find out. Her *sister* was there. The guy is *extraordinarily* unstrategic about cheating if that's what was happening... Given that, I might give him one chance to explain in case somehow there is some story here that makes it all make sense. Otherwise, OP, I think you should leave him :-/"
"Find a quiet time, when you're both more-or-less relaxed and calm and when you have a long stretch of time alone that you know you won't be interrupted. If you need to ask our sister to spend the night with a friend. Make yourself up a script so that you can get your thoughts in order, and so you have time to formulate what you want to say in the right way.


""Husband, we need to talk. Lately it's become very obvious how attracted you are to [Sister]. I know that you and her would never do anything together, and I know that it's natural to be attracted to someone like her.


However, right now our relationship is really suffering and I need your help to rebuild it. Even aside from having [Sister] around, we haven't been prioritizing each other lately. We've both been too busy, and we've both let things get stale.


I have a few suggestions that I'd like to talk about and I'm hoping that together we can come up with a plan to strengthen our marriage.""


This type of language is non confrontational, and should really emphasize your *partnership*, and the fact that you both need to pitch in and do some work.


There should be some mutual agreements here, things like:


* Setting a date night once a week; one week you plan it, the next week he plans it, and so on.


* Discussion of seeing a marriage counselor for one or two sessions just to help you both re-connect.


* A mutual effort to rekindle intimacy between you two; even if you're not having sex every night, there should be some type of intimacy. 


There should also be some individual work going on here, like:


* You should be making an effort to stay fit and healthy; this will make you feel sexier, and it will also make you feel more confident. You say:


&gt;Why is he trying so hard to impress her, doesn't my opinion matter to him?


But also,


&gt;I've gained weight steadily over the last year


Doesn't his opinion matter to you? Shouldn't you be trying to impress your husband, if you want him to try to impress you?


* He needs to make an effort to stop ogling your sister. This should be a no-brainer; it's disrespectful to both you and her, and it's gross. He's a grown adult and he can control himself. 


* Marriage is about compromise. He needs to compromise with you, but you need to make an effort to. Things like:


&gt;He wanted to go to the local beach other day, I didn't want to, and he complained that I've become ""boring"". 


Well... why not just go to the beach with him? I mean, I get it if there was some big reason not to, but if it was just 'meh' to you, why not go with him?


&gt;I find myself getting irritated with everything he does and I find excuses to start fights.



This has got to stop, too. You can't rebuild a relationship when you're actively fostering conflict within the relationship.


* Finally, he needs to be able to approach this in a spirit of openness and respect. He needs to admit that, yeah, ogling and being so blatantly attracted to your sister is not okay. If you're going to be mature and admit your faults, and admit where you can improve, he needs to display the same maturity and admit where he's gone wrong. "
"This guy gets it. GPA is irrelevant unless you pulled a 3.7+ and want to show off

Get your LinkedIn hustle going"
"Yes, seriously. 

When I moved, I hired help for the heavy things, and did smaller things in my car. He came right at the end of it. Helping with maybe 4 or 5 boxes."
"How old are you OP?

And yes these are massive glaring red flags. Many many abuse victims are more susceptible because their barometer for normal is completely messed up. 

Yours is at least working okay since since it's telling you this doesn't feel right. Listen to that guy feeling any get away from this man. "
"&gt;  but I had a relapse in late September, early October. It spent a lot of cash we didn't have, but I guess I didn't really realize how that would affect her.

&gt;I need to get a handle on that before I think of tackling anything else. It cost me my marriage. It almost cost me my job. I think it's robbed my whole life.

These sentences too stuck out in my opinion. The ""it"" he refers to are his issues (relapsing, addiction, etc.), but he really should say ""*I* spent a lot of cash we didn't have"" and ""*I* doomed my own marriage. *I* nearly doomed my own job. *I've* messed up my whole life by my thoughtlessness. "
Thank you -i think you're right. I think i mostly hate that I wasnt a part of that life with her and in some ways that means my time with her is even shorter.
"I think you have to stop playing games here. Is this REALLY about the birthday? Or does the birthday represent 1.5 years of him consistently disappointing you, being selfish and not meeting your needs?

I'm sure there are benefits to the relationship and there are moments you feel very grateful to be with him. But there is such overwhelming sadness emanating from this post. Am I way off track here?"
"""Hey my bill is coming due and I'd really like to be able to pay off the trip in full ahead of time. Can you please get the funds to me asap?"""
"You've just got a world of good advice here. She has decided being a bigoted quasi-christian is more important than being a wife and a mother.

BTW - If I am not mistaken, Christ never mentions gays at all but h did frown on divorce. 

Good luck, be a good Dad first "
"Yeah, I hate pranks and think nearly all of them are immature, so I was thinking they probably deserved it, but then I read this and I've done similar things, with a fake nose ring on my preschool sister. I guess there wasn't much chance my parents would have believed that though, but the belly piercing is tame as far as most pranks go."
"So in other words, when you set a reasonable boundary, she responds with emotional manipulation and clear signs of unhealthy attachment. That's on her. Let her cry. Don't change your boundaries in response to being cried at. She only does that because it works."
"No, I really don't think you can salvage this friendship. 

I'm guessing you haven't told your husband about this either, probably because his first reaction would be to insist you stop speaking to her... and he'd be right.  Imagine if she were his best friend, sending him nudes and telling him she wished you'd cheat so he'd dump you.

I know she's your friend, but good lord, you are letting her get away with a lot of shit.  She has zero respect for your relationship or your husband.

I'm also wondering why you're framing this as a recent development.  She told you *a year ago* that this was what she wanted.

You have to put a stop to this."
"It's my personal rule that I will never live with a SO again unless they agree to a place that has a spare room.  

Specifically, an extra room that's set up with some forms of entertainment relevant to either/both of us, as well as some comforts, including a couch that is a viable sleeping option if needed.  I cannot live with a partner again if the space allows for nothing but to be all up in each other's shit all the time.

Different things work for different people.  It seems perfectly reasonable to start with more space and figure things out from there, rather than less space without room to breath while you're first figuring out how this step will affect your relationship."
"Is there any way for your friends to actually find out your salary on their own? For instance, government salaries are posted online, and although I doubt you're working in government, is this something they can find out through Glassdoor or something else?

Also, out of curiosity, why are you and your friends all privy to each other's salaries? That's kind of weird, no? "
"&gt;He's put you in a very uncomfortable and difficult position.

THIS. 

Option 1.) If you keep this secret, it can't help but subtly poison your relationship with your bff. It'll be an unspoken thing every time you're around them, and even if you do your best to minimize your exposure to him, it's going to be a gross secret bonding you to him. Also, your friend will notice that you are trying to avoid her husband.

Option 2.) You tell your friend and she ""shoots the messenger."" Because her marriage &gt; the truth, your decades-long relationship. 

My recommendation: Tell your friend's husband that what he drunkenly told you *cannot* remain a secret. Tell him that if he doesn't tell his wife, YOU will. "
"If I'm planning to hang with my friends during the weekend I'm still home in bed at 3:30 am, unless it's some sort of out of town trip. Someone being home, asleep in the middle of the night when they said they were busy with friend's all weekend doesn't make anything about that a lie."
"The main reason you need to tell your husband is if this guy escalates any further than he already has, and you openly shut him down, he will absolutely frame this as you came on to him to cover his ass. Then your position is well he's been openly flirting with you but you didn't mention??

Tell your husband asap. You aren't misreading this. "
"This is the strongest advice. Save up your money and keep your grades up until time to go. It'll feel weird to physically disconnect with them for awhile, but with time it will simply become what is. I encourage you to seek counseling to help with moving forward. Also, /r/Raisedbynarcissists might be a good outlet for awhile. Even if they don't hit all the bullet points exactly, that's a great sub to get solid advice, kindred spirits, and listening ears. "
"Don't say anything to them now. It will only add fuel to the fire and you still need to live there.

Start putting away money to rent your own place (many places want you to pay the first and last's month's rent upfront, plus a security deposit) and get the hell out of there once you're a legal adult. If you want to tell them that you're cutting off all contact, wait until you don't have to live under the same roof.

r/personalfinance could be a great resource for figuring out how to live on your own. "
"It sounds like he gave you an STD. He repeatedly lied to you. He cheated on you for the stupidest of reasons, he was horny and you were at work. That's going to happen next week, and the week after, and so on.

You've only known him nine months. You don't really know him at all. Don't let this loser destroy you with a long, drawn out relationship in which you become paranoid, jealous and insecure, and he cheats repeatedly. 

Break up. Move on."
