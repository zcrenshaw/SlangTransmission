"He treated you like a doormat, there isn't even a question about taking him back or forgiving him. He's made his bed, make him lie in it."
"Jealusty, i.e. when you find a guy to be very attractive, and you're not sure whether you'd rather fuck him or *be* him. That feeling of mixed admiration and horniness is hard to describe. "

"Daniel has 73 interested men on Grindr. He is in town for only 7 days and can only spend 3.5 hours per day fucking strangers. On average it takes a hookup 15 minutes to arrive at Daniel's hotel room. Previous sexual encounters have on average lasted 35 minutes each. Daniel invites men one at a time. Grindr men have on average a 20% chance of flaking when asked to meet and a 13% chance of flaking after agreeing to meet for sex. Those who flake immediately cost Daniel no time, however those who agree to meet and then flake cost Daniel on average 15 minutes.

1. What is the expected number of men Daniel can fuck that week? 2. Using secondary data, calculate the odds of Daniel catching syphilis. 

As always, show your work."

"It's really not the end of your world. There are tons of positive, beautiful people out there and many willing to date as long as you're healthy. It breaks my heart to hear someone try and give up.

Do know that with the advances of medicine today, you can live a normal healthy life! Just gotta go to the doctor for checkups every now and then. 

You wont be unloved or unwanted. And when you are loved, it'll be the best. Trust me, I dated a positive guy and it was fine. "
Sounds like you have to plan for the time-honored gay route of moving the fuck out of your shithole podunk town to someplace with jobs and fashion sense.

"Let me, potentially, translate this for you:

""I would live a life where I didn't have to be in fear for my life, or more importantly, my lover's life, just for holding his hand in public. I would choose to exist as someone who doesn't have to constantly fear shitheads like Mike Pence getting into power. I would gladly trade my position of 'less than' for 'equal to'""

Hope this helps in a contrived, assumed kind of way.

If not. TALK TO HIM. Calmly and rationally."
"As an HIV+ man since 2011, I can honestly tell you your life won’t be ANY different with the exception that you’ll take one pill a day and have blood work done every 6 months. Everything else will be business as usual and you’ll probably live a long healthy life. 

Hang in there, I too felt like my life was over when I got the news, but soon realized that my fears were ALL unfounded."
Don't look back honey. Show that dick the door. 
"When he did that for the first time, it was honest. You could probably feel the emotions in it. When you asked him to keep doing that, you basically asked him to fake it. Not surprising."

"I am often confrontational with my gay humor. 

I don't respect their ego, and I have a cock too...so I tell them to toughen up princess, if you can't joke about it, then what is the deal?

Most of the time they are all super horn dawg, and act as if there is a separate set of rules for me because I ""suck dick"". I remind them that IDGAF about their rules if they don't like it then don't listen.  "
"I think your best approach is to be kind but honest with him. Tell him how you feel and why you’re feeling the way you are. Let him know that the way he treats his body doesn’t just affect him but you as a couple. Sex isn’t an end all in a relationship but having a healthy sex life is very important to keeping your relationship alive and well. Best of luck, let us know how it goes. "
"Well, that depends.

If he's down for whatever reason, he likes to place his head on my chest and get his face wrapped in my arms. I gently scratch and caress his hair and head. He slowly sinks into sleep and when his breath calms, I slowly make myself more comfortable so I can get some sleep, too.

My favorite position is when I'm a big spoon and I wrap my arms around his big, warm chest. I lay my cheek on his back and listen how he breathes. I love this position, because he doesn't return the hug so he doesn't choke me in sleep."

"I personally don't find straight guys any more or less attractive, for me it's just that there are more straight guys to find hot due to there being more straight guys in general. I literally know 1 guy (not including myself) who isn't straight so yeah, most of the irl guys I think are hot, happen to also be straight. I feel like ""straight guy"" porn tells the viewer ""you know that really hot guy who you'll never be with because he's straight? That's not an issue; You can still get with him."" which is just a more targeted version of ""you can have whoever you want"" which, I feel, is the message of most porn anyway. I'm also not too bothered by guy being more into straight guys as the unattainability of things has always brought with it a certain allure. But those are just some thoughts off the top of my head."
I'm not sure how I got to this post. I'm a straight(ish) middle aged lady but this made me happy. You sound like a wonderful caring dude.
"Your early adult life is important. 

Talk to some of your teachers and advisors and ask if they can hook you up with a job that pays about 1.5 times the minimum wage or even a dollar less than that so you can move out. 

Lots of your elders in school do want to help. So try that. Once you get the gig you can leave."
"Personally if I were to have children, I wouldn't care about whom they brought over no matter the gender or sexuality as long as I got to meet them. If you object to your child having sexual relations with people, and the only thing stopping them is the lack of physical proximity for six to eight hours in your house, then you have managed to raise one of the laziest kids ever to exist.

The things a parent should do to be responsible is to provide a comprehensive sex education for all sorts of partners and to provide easy access to protection in the event that they do become sexually active. It should also be the goal of a parent that their kid feels comfortable coming to them with questions about sexual activity whenever they arise. Making it so your child can't invite their friends over does nothing to accomplish that goal. 

From personal experience, if a child does not feel comfortable with their parents and talking about sexual activity, they don't stop having sex, they just lie about it. The choice isn't to have sexually active children or not. The choice is whether you get to know about it or not."
"True story:  I'm a retired airline pilot, a long time ago when I was a new copilot, i was paired up with a Captain who had been in a Lear Jet crash, and half his face was badly scarred from burns, and he had lost the tips of two fingers from the fire.  

He had the most captivating personality and sense of humor than anyone I have flown with:  He described his crash as:  I zigged when I should have zagged!  One of the first mornings that we flew together as a crew, he said, ""I got up this morning and looked in the mirror to shave, and scared myself!"" and we both laughted, but it really broke the ice.  

Incidentally he met his wife AFTER the crash.  And I'm not surprised since he was just so charming as an individual.  I found that after flying a month with him, I had actually forgotten about his burn scars.  And that's the honest truth.  Take from this story what you will."
"We like to cuddle when we first lay down. Sometimes we get frisky, being so close to each other. But once we start falling asleep, we need our space to sleep."
"No. Because they are.

"Run, and don't look back. 

Not only did he start dating behind your back, but he dropped you out of his life the moment he found someone he thought was better, and now he wants you back like nothing happened? Run.

Find someone who respects you. "
"I suggest you direct all your energies right now to getting into a college that's away from home. Clothes don't matter. Your future does. In the meantime, it'll be very possible to have fun with mom and dad by buying stuff that's very masculine and very gay at the same time."
"I mean, kids are super perceptive  I'm sure it was a joke but I find it kind of sweet, you know he sees you guys all the time together, he wants to do what every 13 year old does, bother their siblings.

"I love how out of all the things you posted, obesity is the one you apologise for. Don’t. It’s not healthy to be fat. It’s not nice to fat shame people, but at the same time you are not forced to find fat people attractive. I say this as a fat guy."
"So its not that he's denying your sexuality, its that he just expects you to get on with finding a wife anyway? Ouch. Thats almost worse than anger or denial.

"You feel his cock swell up a bit get extra hard and suddenly it feels like your hole just got a shot of lubrication. Cant really feel the actual cum but some people report a slight stinging sensation as the guy is cumming, more like a slight reaction to the cum. 

Really, its more mental. Hearing the guy change his breathing, grunts and sometimes they tell you while they are shooting.  Watching the guy's face, his whole body tense up and feeling the thrusts change (depending on the person, sometimes they increase pace, or ram it in deeper or just stop while they pulse out their cum). Sometimes just the mental is far more arousing than the feeling. "

"I consider myself a warm person to whom family means more than anything else. Mind you, I have the fortune to have been raised in a loving and supportive family which has let me express myself and never forced me into anything, letting me make my own mistakes, but always giving me guidance and having my back. 

A person that I've been with for 7 years, I consider family. If they asked me whether I would change something about myself which would result in me not feeling the same way about them anymore, but (arguably) improving my life in other areas, I would say no, because I would be betraying them and our experience together, basically saying it isn't worth it.

I don't know what kind of person your boyfriend is, or what kind person you really are, but that's the way I look at it, and the reason I would resolve this particular situation as soon as possible if it happened to me."

"This part is fucking beautiful:

&gt; He was a little stressed, I reassured him that I'll never do anything that's painful and it's completely alright if we can't do it, as you guys had told me that it doesn't always work the first time.

&gt; He asked me ""are you really okay if I can't do it?"" And I was like ""duh, of course babe. It's either great for both of us or we're not doing anything. We'll have plenty of time to try again in the future so don't worry about me""

*that* is how you establish trust with your partner, ladies and gentlemen."
"Sure people can be valued in other ways like being a good house cleaner, programmer, political leader, etc. But you can't deny attractiveness gives you another value to society, and since that's a sexual, superficial value, it tends to be more important than other values to most people. (Not that I agree with it)"
"When I first came out to my brother he was very supportive. He thought some of the gay slang and lingo was hilarious, especially the fluid use of pronouns and honorifics. I’ll never forget watching a Braves game with him and calling out from the kitchen “Who’s at bat?”  The response ? “Miss Klesko. But you know she’s gonna choke. “

"The age difference shouldn't be a big deal. I don't know what kind of job you have, but if you're working office hours, in the long term that might be a bigger, but totally surmountable, problem.

People probably find it so natural that they dont feel the need to mention it. Or at least I hope thats the case. But youre definitely right. It's important not only in vanilla sex but in kinky encounters as well. Funny atmosphere creates room for mistakes and that brings safety and comfort.

"Okay, let's put it this way, if kids shouldn't be shown homosexuality then by the same stroke they shouldn't be shown heterosexuality."
Use a goddamn condom.
Homophobes worry that gay guys will treat them the same way they treat women.
A lot of people say you can't really actually feel it as sperm and the colon are both body temperature. So the only time you will feel it is when it's leaking out. It's more the idea and emotional feeling that makes it so hot. 
"Dominant. 

When I see a cute guy I like, I want to take him away and turn him into a purely sexual object that is completely owned by me. He might be cute, smart and well spoken - but I want to use him hard and see him become a total slut for me when I'm balls deep. I want to see him let go and take his man's cock like he was born to do."
"I’m a substitute teacher and I’d never bring up being gay with the kids. Sorry, I know it’s not what you want to hear, but parents are awful and idiotic and will get people fired for something like that."

"I don’t understand these self hating gays.

I live in the Middle East raised by a muslim religious family, no one even remotely would accept my sexuality, finding someone to date and love is extremely hard . 

But I would never even think about changing my sexuality just to be accepted , I guess I’m just proud of being gay . And if I lived somewhere where being gay is not considered a crime then I would be waving that rainbow flag "

"I definitely have this, but I feel it only works on already (physically) attractive guys. If I don't find them attractive, them having a dog or a kid won't change much, but if I do? 

Case in point: was riding a tram when this gorgeous guy with big arms comes in, late 20s / early 30s, wearing sweatpants and bulging. I'm already thirsty af at this point, but after 2 or 3 stops, a beautiful lady comes in with a 4 year old girl in tow. The girl launches into the guy laughing, and he picks her up and gives her a kiss; it's his wife and daughter. I was flatlining."
I can’t believe how mad my friend is but Christians just piss me off. They only seem to care about gay guys these days 
"Tell her that you find that tomfoolery annoying and that it bothers you. If she refuses to quit talk to HR, or just skip the first sentence all together.

"I’m a fat guy who sweats at even just the sight of gym equipment, let alone when I actually use it. There’s a river pouring out of my pores.

I’ve got man boobs that jump around when I run on the treadmill and fat rolls that lift up my shirt when I exercise. 

I’ve been bothered, made fun of or otherwise negatively approached exactly zero times. I have, however, made conversation with people who were asking me how to use some machines since they saw me using them. 

People genuinely do not care about others at the gym. The super buff guys you see walking around? Yeah, they’re too busy looking at their own reflections in the mirror in the free weights area. 

There’s an unspoken understanding that you do not make fun of or judge people at the gym because to come to a gym is to accept that your body needs to improve. Those buff guys? They were at one point either that fat guy dying on the treadmill or that skinny kid who couldn’t lift even 1lb.

I don’t use the changing rooms and you don’t have to either. If you do, just keep to yourself and wrap a towel around yourself if you’re scared.

Stop being a bitch and dump his ass.
"No way. 

That's a form of psychological abuse used by many abusers to strip their partners of any support system they have.

This is one of the creepiest posts I have seen in a very long time. 
"I'd approach the subject with a ""I think you are starting to develop unhealthy habits and I'm worried about your future health"" slant first. He has to want to change to lose weight and if you are worried about hurting his feelings then it's best to avoid sex especially since yalls sex life is in the decline. If he just brushes you off then I'd make it more about physical appearance."

"When I wake up to early and I can't sleep, I shuffle close to my husband and squeeze him as I press my face into the back of his neck (big spoon here). He usually grumbles, and then wiggles a bit to make sure we're snug. Somehow, someway, I always end up going back to sleep."

"&gt;I definitely feel liberal in the sense that I think everyone should have healthcare, and disadvantaged minority groups deserve help to give them a chance in life. And of course I believe in gay rights.

Then you're a liberal. 

Don't let the fringe cases get to you, there's plenty on both sides and both sides love to play victim (I have relatives who claim they're ""persecuted"" for being white/straight/Christian). 

Ignore those who play victim, ignore those who scream about privilege, ignore those who think everything is racist. They all come from the same cesspool and are simply in a pissing contest to be the most miserable and to blame everyone else for their problems.

Focus on yourself, focus on helping others where you can, and vote for what you feel is right in every election. "

He threw my phone across the room. Good times. "
"&gt;Is there like, an etiquette at the gym? Specifically, like, shower time?

"They are.

&gt;I have came to realize that when the talk about homosexuality emerge mostly is about bashing gay men and how They are perverts but when it comes to lesbian is like no they actually playing around They need dick and they will be okay.

That's why it's more common on tv and movies to have lesbian couples than gay couples. Gay couples mean a show is lgbt and can be too risqué, lesbian couples mean a show is simply inclusive and can even be ""classy"". [This trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweepsWeekLesbianKiss) has a little to do with that. There are exceptions, and things are slowly changing, though. 

Not to mention that ""bromance"" is only a thing due to how taboo male affection is. Female friends can be close emotionally and phisically without being seen as lesbians and suffering violence. ""Bromance"" is becoming a thing because people are slowly starting to accept male relationships like that, but even then it's target of mockery."

I was an ex fat guy too. Only older fat men wanted to fuck me. 5 months on keto and regular jogging and Im atm going to a threesome date with a hot ginger twink and a blonde twink. :D

All those fat acceptance movement is stupid. I lost weight, I am much more confident in myself. I am morr attractive. I feel better. More and more twinks wanna date me.

Helps to be a bottom too "
"&gt;  If they asked me whether I would change something about myself which would result in me not feeling the same way about them anymore, but (arguably) improving my life in other areas, I would say no, because I would be betraying them and our experience together, basically saying it isn't worth it.

This is exactly the issue. It's saying you aren't worth me not getting to be perceived as ""normal."" It's saying social acceptance from small minded people matters to you more than your relationship. "
Equal partnership 
Well really most of high school was an awkward boner story. 
"I got this beefy, hunky straight co-worker to show me his nudes... Man he's got some real meat hanging!"
"Prostate orgasms.

My friends can understand how great/relieving it feels to take a huge shit, but for some reason cannot envision getting that same pleasure from anal stimulation."
"Oh whatever both are consenting adults. They can do what they want. Yeah it's taboo but it's not like he's gonna get him pregnant and suddenly they have kids with 6 toes. Besides you always see that kind of stuff on pornhub and shit. Most of it is fake but how can you ever really know. You wanna keep doing it, go for it but beware the consequences."
"If only Scruff wasn't called Scruff I think it wouldve already gained dominance over Grindr. I've converted a lot of people to using Scruff just by telling them what it is and sometimes showing them the app. A lot of gay men, even the ones with facial hair, don't like guys with scruff or body hair so the name is very misleading as all groups are present and welcome.  "
"When in bed with my man, he tends to fall asleep faster while I have a rough time doing so , when that happens , he always at some point turns to me and hugs me and sometimes gives me a kiss.

It's just cute he can aknowledge I'm there while being knocked out."
"I support equality for all people. When we start looking for special status, I'm off the train. Example: if you want to be a firefighter, police officer, member of the military, etc. you should have to meet the same fitness standards as your colleagues, not call the standards unfair and lobby to have them changed. "
"Shared a hot tub with two women and a straight couple, we were all married that day too.

When we went to bed we made insane love.  Gentle love, dominant fucking, submissive slave, slow fucking, kissing, kissing, each tops and bottoms and then falling asleep slowly in each other's arms.

BTW, we had been together 18 years before we were able to get married."
Not as glad as I am 😀
"We were tired and slept naked. Nothing magical, or comical, or dramatic. 

We had sex the next morning. I think my husband told me something along the lines ""I'll legally cum now"". "
"Yes, but when I said that I wanted 3 kids to my boyfriend, he promptly dropped my hand and gave me a 'wtf' look. He wants dogs more than kids, but I prefer kids more than dogs. So we came up with an agreement: for every kid we adopt, we gets to have 2 dogs in the house."
"Not a teacher, but I have to say I'd have loved there to be an openly LGBT member of staff when I was at school. Not even so I could talk to them about it, but just to see it being lived as a seemingly successful adult. Be a role model. Show that no matter what happens at school or at home, you can survive and get to a better place."
You went to one club on one night. Try a different night to see what it's like. Some clubs are clicky while others are not. Don't give up so quickly.
"Neither. 

I added his last name as a middle name. 
He added my last name as a middle name.

We did not legally change our names, but added them to our signatures on a certificate we then framed. 

We were both established professionals with a recognizable name recognition relating to our areas of expertise. I am a technical subject matter expert in my field, and he was a media broadcast principal with some degree of celebrity. So, professionally speaking, we couldn’t really change without loosing name recognition. So we just didn’t. "
"In Spain you get to keep your last name, even after you get married."
"Grindr isn't for making friends while you're away visiting without your boyfriend.

Tell him it would make you uncomfortable.  But honestly, if he watns to cheat, he will cheat."
Yeah and I kind of regret it now that my friend is mad at me and it’s always gonna be awkward with her family 
"No, definitely not too young. I had a suspicion by the time I was 10 or 11, but then I forcibly suppressed it until my mid-20s. Don't do what I did."
"&gt; Then he goes “I’ve met someone else and I think I want to pursue it with him”. [...] he then asked me to sleep on the couch because it was disrespectful to the guy he was now seeing. [...] I remember laying on his couch and hearing him talking to the new guy, calling him baby and all that, telling him about me “he’s still here but he’s on the couch”.

Wow, what a dick move. All he cared about was himself and his selfish desires, not giving a shit about you.

Don't take him back."
"Sounds like an idiot.
You should bring a boy home."
"The BF and I like them, but we're smart enough to keep them under the collar. 

Someone's left a literal mark on you. Don't you think that's... appealing?"
I don't like when they use gay as a synonym for weak.
"We sacrificed a boar to Hircene, the Lord of the Hunt, who then blessed our ceremony with his essence allowing our marriage to be recognized under eyes of Mara. Afterwards, we ate the boar and split it into 16 pieces, to honor each of the 16 Lords and saved the boar's head to be placed upon a mantle piece above our hearth. "
"Don't let Grindr, Jackd, or any of the gay dating apps get you down or make you cynical about sex and dating. Don't waste too much time on them either. Go out, have fun, live your best life, and guys will come."
HUH?? What types of dicks are you sucking!?
And he's straight???????
"Not much but I was home and clearly dying from sleep deprivation and he saw me on the couch and I tried so hard not to scowl but failed miserably. He came over to me and just wrapped himself around me and cuddled me to sleep. 

I came to like 4 hours later and he was still on me but I was the one embracing him. He was asleep.

It dawned on me that that was the first time we ever napped together and I know it’s not intimate in the traditional way but I think it’s one of the best moments I’ve had with him."
"People may bitch about it, but having an unmoderated gay sub is great. If I want moderation there's plenty of other options."
"As a proud liberal, nothing, literally NOTHING annoys me more than the Oppression Olympics. It's irritating and a colossal waste of time.

But don't let it get to you.

It'll distract you from all the wonderful fellow liberals like you that you want to fight for quality causes with."
"The kid knows, they're really perceptive, he's smart enough to work out you guys are together but not emotionally mature enough to work out how to broach the subject."
"Big part of why I'm not coming out publicly any time soon, gay sex jokes are hilarious when everyone in the room is straight. 😂😂😢"
"I think frottage is the best shit ever! I don't know what is about two hard, pulsing cocks rubbing against each other, but it just feels so freaking erotic! 

But of course, since that's at the top of my sexual activities list, not everyone finds it as pleasing as me and it bums me out sometimes 😭😭😭"
I've dated a decent chunk of attractive guys and Most have had god awful personalities. Guys that used to be unattractive that tried hard and changed their life are the exception to this. 
"Can I confirm, you got hard and he felt it on his ass?"
"Damn, call me."
"Assuming his straight friend sat on his lap? Idk that's what I got from ""learning the hard way"""
AHAHAHA I laughed so hard at this 
"He's real classy and sophistercated.

I aint"
"Trust me, I've thought about it. "
"I love the fact that you respect your little brother enough not to disrupt his routine; Autism is never easy to live with and good on you for being an awesome big bro! 

As for the guy...I'd fuck you based solely on how sweet you are to your brother. So there's a tonne of guys out there waiting for you, who won't kick you out of bed after 5 years because he wants to drink milk from another glass. 

Go out there baby, you'll find your prince. But stay away from that douche."
"You feel guilty for a reason, this feeling didn't come from nowhere. Obviously the guy is most certainly in the wrong since he's the married one, but I don't see how that's relevant to whether what you did is also wrong. You knew he was married, you felt bad before you even did it, but you still did. And now you still feel guilty. Hmm.. "
Hot lesbians are still more accepted than hot gay men.
"We hugged everyone as they left, drove home, got Taco Bell on the way, and fell into bed with our pups. Totally exhausted and full of bliss. I love him. "
Wow I wish things like that happen to me. But I don’t have a roommate
"Imo this is the best answer in this thread. None of this dropping hints or ""cook healthy meals for him"" malarky (although the second one would be a good addon to this advice). Tell him straight up how you feel. Seeing as dropping hints hasn't worked, he is likely like most men: he needs to be given an objective. 

It reminds me of this comedy routine about the difference between how women and men communicate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZBxdqGo8oA&amp;list=PLH2uhJ2RmgYWAXxw7FYtGAqIbhygkxnXt&amp;index=1"
"&gt; I’m not completely thirsting for him 

&gt; *writes long detailed post about attraction for guy, under the name IamSoSoSoInLove, asking for tips on how to interact with him next time* 

Oh honey "
I watched my straight best friend suck my dick and he swallowed.  Does that count? 
"He's older than me, in his 40s. Clean-cut, beard, sexy lean physique. He's gay but you wouldn't be able to know. Think Anderson Cooper. There have been many days where I've wanted him to take me some place alone in the office and fuck me senseless.

In a department meeting once, some of us had to stand around the room while the meeting was going on. I'm standing across from him and notice he clearly has a hard-on going. Must have been one of those unexpected ones. It was sexy as fuck. He was wearing tight fitted chinos so I could clearly make out his hard cock resting down the side of his thigh. Jerked off thinking about it at lunch time in the toilets."
"lol sometimes i just sit back and wonder why the fuck i wasn't born with the body of a greek god before i realize that that shit needs work, so i'm trying it out too, but even if i'm seeing -1% results and compare myself endlessly to the massive hulking walking sex fantasies walking around my campus, i just kinda figure that i've got friends way more unfortunate than i am and that i should be proud of my subpar body and be proud of myself for trying to improve it"
Does there exist a differentiable function f : R → R such that f′(0) = 0 but f′(x) ≥ 1 for all x ̸= 0?
"so hot, this: ""the colon was made for absorbing nutrients""

perfect line to drop, if I ever am in a situation where I have the wanton urge to breed a twink who is reluctant"
"Boyfriend is just the word I've always used, it doesn't really fit with what he is, partner doesn't really hit the nail on the head either (but I don't really like that word). He's the only person who's really ever stuck with me through thick and thin, even my parents ditched me when I came out. He means much more to me than any word could ever portray. 


Boyfriend's just the word I'm used to and like. I'll (hopefully) be calling him my Fiancé here in a couple months :).  "
"ok I suck at math but I took a stab at it

((73*.7*50)+((73*.8)*.1*15))/60 = 44.04 hours total if he were to try to meet up with all the guys

He only has 24.5 hours available, so (73*24.5)/44.04 = 40.6 guys he could contact. 40.6*0.7=**28.42 total successful hookups**. 

Right?

I'll let someone else take a stab at number 2, I've spent enough time on this as it is lmao"
Post a selfie
"YOU said nothing wrong! If they can't take it then they shouldn't be dishing it out, either. Your friend's aunt had no business saying that, and if your friend doesn't see that, then maybe they aren't the friend you think they are.

I'm sorry you've had to put up with that."
"He's this tall, skinny, blond guy in our engineering department that's fresh out of college and I can't stop stealing glances at. He'a the prefect STEM twink. His smile is amazing too... it just makes me want to shove my dick up his ass and watch him grin  and moan in pleasure.

He's not all that interesting, though, which is a shame. Makes it hard to find excuses to talk to him."
"I’m so sorry this happened.  You need to remember his family cut him out of their lives.  He is going through a grieving process.  Just be there for him, maybe suggest counseling to help.  I hope everything works out"
Addiction.
"Every time we start to cuddle it eventually leads to him putting it in me, which is awesome. But then when that's over I'm very much in need of my own space."
"The funny thing is this: Those who claim you have to be muscular, fit, or white, are rarely themselves muscular, fit, or white!  I was born and raised on a Native American Reservation.   I'm masculine and fit, but hardly a beauty by any means.  I did a career in the military, and looked the part.  Basic military build, with flat top hair cut, etc.

Yet for all my average looks and style, I have never lacked sexual attention.  I have spent over forty years now in three committed long term relationships, and my three partners were GQ beautiful, and super intelligent besides.  Two of my partners were people of color, and they too never lacked for attention from others, both male and female.  I had to raise the two younger brothers of my first lover when the parents were incapacitated, and they too never lacked for attention.

This idea that only whites and muscular beauties get sex, or love, or attention is really a self depreciating inferiority complex in the minds of those who aren't white and muscular, etc.  When I was a younger lad one of my older gay mentors explained the 3% rule to me.  As a concept it really works.

The whole advertising industry, indeed, all capitalism is based on the three percent rule.  That being that any given person, product, or thing only attracts three percent of the population, and if you can connect with that three percent, you have a big hit on your hands product wise.

In a functional sort of way acceptance of this truth is the key to happiness.  Don't try to make everyone like you.  Even the most beautiful people on earth will fail at that.  Just be yourself, and try to connect with the three percent that will like it.  Be rigorously honest about what you really think, really feel, really want, and really are, and put it right out there.   

When you put it right out there, with simplicity and directness, those who like it can see it, and vector in, and those who don't like it can pass you by.  People don't get upset when you don't have what they want.  People get upset with you when they spend a bunch of time on you, and then find out you aren't what they want.  

Everything works so much better if you are just direct and honest with what you are, and accepting that 97% aren't going to like it going in.  The three percent that will like you is going to be way more than you will have time to handle.

Cultivate this as an attitude towards life and you will see that it is true."
Mine's a stow and go. Definitely a grower not a shower. 
To answer the question...hmmm see them trying to catch a glimpse of my dick in the lockeroom or whilst pissing. it's somewhat of a game they play. Try to see my big black dick lol. But I don't show all the goodies unless I plan on using it. 
"1. He was never planning on meeting up with you/anyone and just didn't want to say so or

2. The pictures he sent are not him or

3. He came/found a hookup

I bet 9 out of 10 guys fall into one of these categories so this covers it lol."
"Then don't make it a big deal. Next time they make you talk about women just say in a slightly exasperated tone, ""Guys, I know i've been misleading, but I'm not interested in girls. I don't to make it a big deal, but this isn't easy to say after being closeted for three years. I just want to be able to freely hook up with dudes without making y'all wonder wtf is going on."""
"He was honest and open about something he thought of and then immediately accepted your answer and moved on. This sounds like the best case scenario possible, good couple communication 101. "
"This is what I hate about American Christians. Half of them are Pharisees and the other half are into charismatic divine healing nonsense. Good for you, man."
"That's a great situation with just one outcome - you separate.

Scenario one: you are seduced by the hired man. This shows your man is not enough for you and the relationship is not built on a stable ground. So it's better to don't bother.

Scenario two: you are not seduced. However, your ""partner"" is a controlling, manipulative guy and you will be much better without any contact with him."
