"By no means am I the guru for life. But check out trucking. You‚Äôll make 30-40k your first year. You‚Äôll see the country.  They can teach you for free at swift, prime, cr England. It‚Äôll get you out of debt in a year or two and you‚Äôll get on with life. I got into trucking for a ‚Äúright now job‚Äù and am still in it clearing 85k annually delivering gas in my town."
"Yup, attended the premiere with my parents!"
"As far as affecting me, it didn't do much. My parents were always lenient on that kind of stuff. 

Yep! Back in high school, basically everyone knew (I was homeschooled for middle school)."
I'm 26 and taking care of myself sometimes feels like taking care of a 10 year old. Good for you for doing this!
"I am not sure how requests work, but I have done this. I'd be happy to answer questions."
How did being in R rated movies affect you as a kid? Did your teachers and peers know?
You start by taking wi-fi routers and installing a new OS on them that lets them talk to each other and route traffic. That works for connecting a neighborhood. Then each neighborhood builds a tower to talk to other neighborhoods using special high-power wifi equipment. Then cities can reach other using high-altitude drones as relays.
"Good question. There is an ASL sign for ""mute"", but I don't bother with it because most speaking people don't know sign language. I usually just let the person finish talking first, and then I cover my mouth with my right hand. This works 99% of the time. For the 1%, I write them a note.

If I'm the one starting the conversation, I just begin by smiling and handing them the note. Most people catch on pretty fast. Sometimes, the speaking person reads my note and assumes I am deaf. When this happens, they usually stop talking to me entirely and write me a note back, ha ha. This doesn't bother me, because I know they are trying and I appreciate the effort.

Edit: I forgot something. Only once, a person actually got mad at me for writing them a note. I was only asking for directions. He also thought I was deaf, I guess, because as he walked away he muttered ""he should wear a sign or something"". No thanks, random angry stranger."
Why did you use that font it‚Äôs scaring me even more
"When you are a kid in an R-rated movie, do they let you watch it after? Do you get to go to the premiere? "

My favorite isn't really a secret secret but most people don't know about it. You can get a dorito taco in the cheesy gordita crunch. It adds so much flavor 
"I've seen so many comments tonight regarding dicks, but this one made me laugh my ass off.

Bradley is a super laid back dude, we actually played catch on set!"
I fail to see why people are getting so aggravated? I sit down to pee when I can and stand when I can't. 
"Were you paid on a per-dick basis?

Also, Bradley Cooper tends to have a few cool/calm personality traits in his roles. Is he like that in real life?"
"Yup! One got no traction, the other got a sliiight response. I figured that since I‚Äôm having a lazy day, I‚Äôd try again."
Dude that's ducking sick. I was 15 when Superbad came out and wanted to see it so goddamn bad but there was no way for me to get in. Ended up watching it for the first time on my PSP a year later. You were great. 
Not at all. Terrorism is against the fundamentals of Islam. Islam literally means peace. Murder of anyone literally deprives you of the status of being Muslim in Islam. I'd say educate yourself and don't believe everything you hear.

"Thats fukn tough lol. I hope that people understand mental illness is extremely confusing when you begin to experience symptoms. I hope people realize that there needs to open discussion about mental illness, and (especially in light of recent US tragedies) mental healthcare needs to be much more acceptable and affordable. 
I was diagnosed at age 21, and i'm 22 now. The worst part about it was the truly embarrassing (and sometimes offensive or potentially dangerous) things that my mind was making me do. There are tons of examples I could give, but I remember one time I was in my dorm at college and there were some people having a conversation outside. I was having constant auditory hallucinations and thought the person was calling up to my dorm window that I was a pussy and that I was too scared to go and out and fight him. I went out and almost fought a complete stranger. Those things were scary, and I just want people to know that mental illness is not some 'oooo look at my weeby fantasy girlfriend that I can makeup and fuck whenever I want', its a potentially dangerous and embarrassing thing that society needs to have open dialogue about. Sry if thats long."
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VOLCANO SAUCE AND HOW DO WE MAKE IT
"That's a very good question! I keep an emergency whistle in my pocket just in case. It was only $3 at the camping store, and that sucker is LOUD. It can easily be heard over a mile away. I guarantee that if there's an emergency, sometime will hear me.

My wife hates that whistle so much, ha ha."
"How small of a bump can cause enough damage to cause bone growth? Like, if you accidentally bumped into the corner of the kitchen counter, or hit your elbow on a door jam, would it start?"
"Good questions! You are not an idiot, and I promise I'd tell you if you were, lol.

One time at work, I accidentally dropped a 50 pound box on my foot. I instinctively tried to shout, but all that came out was a weird, quiet gurgling sound. I guess I had a lot of saliva in my throat? It was very embarrassing, but luckily nobody else was around to hear it. My foot survived, slightly bruised but not broken.

As for sneezing, I think it sounds the same, but it hurts a lot more than it used to. I take allergy pills to prevent sneezing as much as possible."
"There are no cures, if thats what you mean, i am currently on a drug trial for one that should stop the bone forming, if you mean in general medicine wise, everyone who has is uses different ones, im on a variety of medicines for different reasons"
"I've only been mute for about a year now, but it is permanent. Without going into too much detail, I was in an unavoidable accident that caused a great deal of nerve damage in my throat and jaw. The muscles and bones healed, I don't even have any scars. But the nerves are shot, and always firing. It hurts to eat, sneeze and cough, kind of like a perpetual sore throat from Hell. I have lost a lot of weight this last year because I can no longer enjoy my favorite foods. Some people would argue that's a good thing, ha ha."
"A lot, at school i can't go outside since if i get tripped up it can start it, i cant do sports for the same reason, i can't walk more than 10 minutes without needing to stop, i cant put anything on thats not pants, trousers or gloves, i cant use a bath, my left arm is locked so i cant extend that, i cant stretch my arms out to the side and i cant stretch them any higher than my chin"
Have you tried pressing the un mute button? Works for me in discord.
"Hah, feels like i could be a spy or something with how careful i have to be of my surroundings. Hell maybe i was a really bac asshole in my previous life to end up with this"
"I haven't had any problems breaking silences. When I have something to say, I just hand that person a note, and a conversation starts. Sometimes it can be hard to get peoples' attention if they're not looking at me, but I've found that a light shoulder tap doesn't seem to offend anyone, at least not yet.

As for finding peace, it fluctuates. My mood depends a lot (probably more than it should) on how people treat me when we interact. With friends and family, I'm content. At work, it can be frustrating at times. Out in public, I can get pretty upset at how strangers communicate with me once they realize I'm mute. I don't let any of that show outwardly, because most people are trying their best and I don't want to discourage them. Like it or not, I am now a representative of my condition, and if I am a jerk to someone it could lead to them becoming bigoted.

So I guess peace is a daily thing. Sometimes I miss my voice, sometimes I don't, depending on the situation. I can tell you that today, on Reddit, I am at peace."
"Good question. I was off work for three months to heal, and had a long discussion with HR when I got back. To their credit, they were very kind and offered to make any reasonable changes to help me keep my current position, but I knew it wouldn't work. I used to do a lot of interacting with customers, and it just wasn't realistic to stay in that position. I asked to stay with the company, but in a department where I wouldn't have to directly interact with customers. 

They moved me to their largest warehouse, with the option to return to my old job if I didn't like it. But I ended up loving it! I make the same pay, but I can wear jeans to work. Nobody bothers me as long as I get my work done. I do a little bit of everything, shipping, receiving, paperwork, and sometimes I sweep up if the custodian's busy. I love it there. I got really, unbelievably lucky.

Edit: spelling is hard."

"There are several, but here are the two most common ones that bug me the most:

1) Upon realizing I'm mute, some people slow their speech, enunciate every syllable, and wave their arms around. These people usually think I am mentally handicapped in some way. Not cool. Unless I ask you to slow down, please speak to me like you would talk to anyone else.

2) People are in a hurry, and I understand that. But if you want to converse with me, please be patient and let me write the dang note! While you wait for my response, please don't audibly sigh, tap your foot, or look at your watch. It's just not nice.

Those are the big two, those are the ones that make me sad and angry. But here are a few other things that people do, that don't bother me at all, because I know they're trying. I appreciate the effort!

1) Sometimes people think I'm just hard of hearing, and they yell at me.

2) Some people (usually older ladies) will start whispering to me. I have learned that these people think I am very shy and timid, and are trying not to scare me.

3) I call this one ""The Canadian"", because some people apologize to me because I'm mute. I love this one. How is this your fault?! These are nice people."
"What, if any, treatments are there?"
No. but I can only speak for myself. The closing guy seemed pretty fed up with the place 
"When I was about 14, I started smoking marijuana with a ""worldly"" (non JW) neighbor of mine.  We would go for long walks at night, just talking about all sorts of things, philosophy, history, sociology, etc.  I tried actually preaching to him during this time, and he would point out major major major flaws in the JW reasoning.  I quickly realized that he was right, and I had been fooled . I still went back and forth, still believing maybe they had the truth, for a couple of years.  But by the time I was 17 I was pretty much sure that they were total BS.  I've only went back once or twice out of pure curiosity since then.  "
"I know you‚Äôre likely not the Taco Bell worker that this happened to but I feel as though this is a great opportunity to get something off my chest.  I was on a mission trip when I was like 14 and we stopped at this TBell in bum-fuck no where, somewhere between the Upper Midwest and Denver.  I‚Äôm sure the staff of this otherwise very slow Taco Bell were mortified to see 20+ kids pour out of a few touring vans, headed for the doors.  In the ~45 minutes it took to for everyone to get food (this kitchen crew had probably served, at most, like 5 people at a time before this), I grew very impatient and also developed another appetite while waiting.  I also had no money.  My attention was drawn to those fluorescent plastic coin platform games that most TBell‚Äôs had.  If you got the coin to land on the lowest rung of the platforms, you got a free dollar menu item or something.  Whatever, free food.  So I MacGyver‚Äôed a contraption out of a straw wrapper.  By wrapping up a coin in the paper, I could just ease the coin down platform by platform, unwinding the wrapper around the coin little by little until it just slides right out onto the lowest platform.  Ez-pz.  I did this like 3 times before the other kids caught on and soon, to the dismay and defeat of the poor man working behind the counter, I had a dozen free dollar menu items racked up for me and the buds.  The worker was honestly so fed up, I felt incredibly bad afterwards.  And now that I‚Äôve worked in food service/customer oriented jobs, I know just how demoralized and shit on the guy felt.  It wasn‚Äôt a job he wanted, but the money was needed.  And I just sat there and milked him for the worth of the already-frenzied kitchen staff.  I‚Äôm really sorry.  And on behalf of all the other assholes that you had to deal with at TBell, I hope you can forgive us.  You‚Äôre the real MVP‚Äôs back there.  Thank you! 

Tl;dr: I exploited a coin machine game at Taco Bell and probably ruined the staff‚Äôs day.  :( 

As for my question, I guess I‚Äôm curious if your location had one of those little coin games?  The image of those yellow, green and orange plastic boxes is synonymous with my youth.  I always drop a coin in these days if they‚Äôre on the counter!  "

"1) Everyone in my home lost weight, the first couple of weeks were pretty chaotic, food was scarce and we had to ration it.  An usual breakfast consisted of one egg, a piece of toast and coffee.  Everyone got used to SPAM and cup o noodles.  
2) Netflix, specially at night, I got used to reading books before bedtime with a flashlight.  When the power came back it was madness, my neighbor got some pitorro out and we celebrated, then I took a loong nap, it was blissful without the sound of the generators. 
3) Irma wasnt nearly as bad a Maria, I am not sure how many people died, but I am sure that the health problems started with Irma due to the lack of power, specially in the hospitals.  Then Maria came two weeks later, so I believe many people that died with Maria were pretty affected by Irma first.  "

"I could, and a lot of disabled people do. But I want to be more personal than that. I want people to see me open my pad and write a note just for them.

This does mean that sometimes I have to write the same note several times a day, but I think it's worth it. "

"First of all, you can get out of this hole! I was $80k in debt and still have $30 remaining but with a plan to pay it off in the next three years.

First thing you need to do it educate yourself. Head over to r/personalfinance and read their wiki. The age specific info and the flow chart of how to spend your money was super helpful to me. Speak with your loan provider (i.e. the devil) to talk about options. Be nice  and calmly explain that you cannot make those payments. If they are federal you have tons of repayment options including income-based. I personally keep my loan payments as low as possible. You can change your payment plan if it doesn't work for you, even if it hasn't been a full year. I know they are fuckin you over but having a calm and positive attitude will get you further than you think. You can also talk to your University to see if they have any financial advisory services. Not positive but legal aid may also help to provide you with resources.

Second you need a plan to make more money. Stop saying you have a useless degree. In my experience just having a four year degree, regardless of the major, if better then nothing. Being able to follow through on your commitments and communicate effectively are two major skills you got in college. You have value! Do not rely on online applications to get employed. Forgive my language but print out some resumes, get off your ass and stop in on any company that you are remotely interested in working for. Just talk to the receptionist, explain that you are interested in job and would like  to speak to the hiring manager. Example jobs you may qualify for are teaching, marketing, admin, writing, and research. 

Third, you need a goal. This is something you are working towards. My first financial goal was minimum payments in my loan. Second was an emergency fund of $1000. You get the point. Your goal may be to move out of your mom's. It doesn't matter if you fail the first try. Readjust and try again. 

You can do this!! Have faith in yourself."

Spurs stuck out of his elbows, keeping his arms fixed against his knees, as they tucked up against his body. The bones in his feet had fused together into a club. Worst of all was his face.

I am legally disabled, but I do not and will not consider myself disabled. I can do almost anything (although I probably shouldn't apply at a radio station, lol), and I have a good job. In fact, my boss has told me that I am a better employee now since I became mute.

Of course, I not saying anything bad about those with psychological and/or selective mutism. I can only discuss my personal experiences, and I would never say I am better or worse off than anyone else. Everybody has their own struggles, it's all relative."

"I dint think it's difficult to sit and listen, I've been doing it all my life. If I have something to say, I usually can write fast enough to get it in before the conversation changes. If not, I just stick the note in my pocket, which can be discouraging.

As for my writing style, it has definitely evolved. It's also very conditional. When I write a note to my boss or my wife (my other boss), it's much more formal and lengthy than a note I write to a coworker or a buddy. I must also be aware that there is literally a written record of everything I say! I am much more careful with my words than I used to be, back when I could talk. Written words can be easily misinterpreted, if not chosen carefully. I can give examples of this if you want them."

 i have ribs that go all the way down to roughly where my stomach ends and legs start, i have a slither of bone in my back above my back bone, and i have general lumps from areas it has flared up.

"The internet as we know it is actually made up of a bunch of separate networks that all talk to each other. That's actually where we get the name, from 'inter network'.

So, DIY networks can be part of the internet as much as any ISP can. (There are definitely barriers to overcome, but it's doable). Eventually, if there were enough home-grown networks, and big enough, people could communicate without having to use commercial networks like comcast and verizon. "
"How are you only able to find a job at $11 an hour part time with a degree?
