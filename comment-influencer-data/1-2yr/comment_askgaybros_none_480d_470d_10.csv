"It is a fallacy to assume that any person who faces discrimination  in one dimension (say, race or sexuality) will therefore naturally be immunized against discriminatory thinking towards others in some other dimension (say, sexuality or race). 

The sad truth is, a *lot* of gay people are racist. 

The sad truth is, a *lot* of of racial minorities are homophobic.

People are all subject to empathetic blind-spots. We are all morally flawed. And it is not really 'hypocrisy' that we fail at inter-sectional awareness of oppression; it is just a fact that all people are born ignorant and imperfect and that we live in a shitty society that fills our heads with shitty ideologies and shitty implicit biases.

Man I can‚Äôt imagine what a tall handsome muscular white guy would do without angels like you taking the time out of your day to throw them a life line

"In my military service I was going to be awarded by the President.  Invitations were sent to my parents without my even being told.  They wrote back saying, ""our son is an abomination, and we cannot in any way seem to condone what he is"".  My commander called me in, showed me the letter, and then burned it up in his ashtray.  He looked me in the eye and said, ""I will be your father now"".

Talk about dodging a bullet!  That was back when they took gays off to jail in the military, and everyone knew what the word ""abomination"" meant."

"I think you're exposed to a bunch of delusional internet virgins full of fantasies, or shallow gays from dating sites and Grindr. My gay friends in my city are awesome and they're none of what you just described. And guess what? None of them are active in dating sites, Grindr or even Reddit.

Let's face it, decent gays in the internet are heavily outnumbered by the shallow gays."
I‚Äôm guessing a good portion of these guys wouldn‚Äôt have gone through with it. Many of them wanted to jerk off thinking about the act only.

This seems like a useful way to identify people who you should not have sex with.

The other part of this story is that you're just discovering the power of being hot (primarily the first two bullet points). People will say yes to virtually anything an attractive person wants. Enjoy a blessed life.
You forgot: Am I gay? Yes

"It's gay ""Cool Girl"" syndrome.

""I'm not a Regular Gay, I don't like musicals and drag queens and speaking in a lisp!""

Thereby taking a giant shit on the many people who do like and do these things (completely reasonably) and reinforcing the stereotype that all gay men DO enjoy these things (despite the fact that you, Cool Gay, are living proof that this is NOT the case):

""I'm just a regular guy, I like Sports and Beer and chi- well not chicks, I guess, but otherwise I'm Just Like You!""

Which is to say: Please like me, I don't relate to what *you* have told me is ""gay culture"".

That's the important thing. Gays are everyone. If you feel a certain way, there is literally no chance that you are alone in that. If you think ""gay culture"" is one thing, and can only ever be one thing, then you are 100% wrong and probably only viewing it from the perspective of straight culture."

"So proud of you habibi. I came out to my mom on the first day of Ramadan. It was very emotional and it didn't go too well. Now she's on a mission to ~fix~ me. But at least she didn't have a violent reaction like kicking me out or cutting me off so there's that. 

This is huge, I hope you and your mom have a blossoming relationship from here onwards. What you did takes courage. üòäüíï"

"The takeaway is don't rush to judgement just because one accusation comes out. As the article notes, for every other major public figure who has been caught in a scandal like this, the first accusation was a trigger for many others to come forward. With Takei there was not a single other person. "
"Because a large demographic of this sub are immature middle school / high school teens that haven't grown up and can't or won't yet accept that straight men = men that do NOT have sex with other men. 

Otherwise he's not straight."
"Although you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs ignorant to expect every man that‚Äôs having some sort of same sex attraction to immediately stop identifying as straight. This process can take some time. 


On the flip side of that, those dudes that have a grindr and hook up with guys constantly but still claim their straight are completely delusional. "
He calls me talkingheads788. It's adorable.
"Ah, the good ol' jealusty. The feeling that will never be know by our straight peers."
"Sometimes I think there's a pressure to conform to ""non-stereotypically gay"" archetype from different social groups.

Case in point, I'm (getting back) into strength sports and combat sports. I love metal, I'm a huge gearhead, I love football--all of which are not historically know for a large gay participation (lesbians notwithstanding /kidding).

And I got a lot of that pressure. 

I like In This Moment, metal friends would go ""I thought you were above that gay shit""

If I wore compression pants to the gym, I got shit. Some of it was genuinely good-natured, they were just giving me the business which I'm fine with. But some of it went deeper. Like yeah, I can be gay asking as I'm celibate and fall nearly into the box you set up for everybody.

I used to be susceptible to it. But then I was hanging out with my friend who does drag and ran into a guy I used to lift with and he said some really fucked up shit to him (he's super fem with a capital lisp). Something flipped and I socked him. Unfortunately, I fought out of my weight class and got the shit beaten out of me but I got my blows in.

Point is, I agree with you. Have some integrity, have some balls, and stand up for your gay comrade (within reason). Since that day I started doing what the fuck suited my fancy as I've been much happier since then. 

And I work way harder to make sure I never cough up blood again after I step up to defend someone."

"I like being submissive and serve a man too, but I also realize that a fantasy is different than reality.

"During hurricane Irma everyone in my family decided to meet up at my grandparents house to ride out the storm together. Most of these people I never or hardly see and I have never came out to any of them. Anyway at some point during the storm, after the power ran out I walked into a room to hear my father proclaiming to everyone ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad this storm is happening. Washing away the gays in the keys‚Äù or something like that, and everyone else agreeing. Then my grandmother chipped in a story about how my grandfather would apparently rob and beat gay people back in the day when he was young. He, sitting only a chair over was acting bashful/proud about it like he was being recognized for some great award and was trying to be modest. Homophobic story time continued around the room for an eternity and it seemed like everyone had something to share. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and pretended to be sick so I could excuse myself to the bathroom."

He gave me a tight squeeze that pulled me tight against the post before he realized he was almost choking me.

I'm into tall guys, being man\-handled, bondage, and light choking. It instantly made me rock hard and flustered.

He's sort of flirty so it's possible he knew exactly what he was doing, but it really caught me off guard going from zero to almost cumming in my pants in less than 3 seconds."

This is fuckin adorable.
Text him you're are in fact gay and it hurt you to hear the responses he gave. Take it from there. He might end the friendship or you will. Either way you'll find out.
"I‚Äôm not proud to be gay. It‚Äôs not something I achieved. I‚Äôm not proud to have two feet either. 

Being proud is about being proud of who you are. Not apologizing for existing. Not hiding. You don‚Äôt need to shout it from the rooftops. Be comfortable in yourself and proud to be you. Not gay. "
Is this science?

To not consider 30 year olds as ‚Äúolder‚Äù.
God I would hate my father for that (even more than I do now). But my most homophobic experience was probably when I was just walking down the street and someone in a car shouted at me: Hey faggot. Dirty queer loser. and then gave me the middle finger. I was in high school and very much openly gay. I went to school with losers. Rich losers but losers nonetheless.
"I‚Äôm old school. You tell me what to call you and I am going to smile and try.....and then probably fuck it up. :(

"Exactly, there‚Äôs a difference between having a type and only being attracted to that type 

OP confused himself with that "
"That's fucked up.


My most homophobic experience was in AP History class in high school. A lot of my classmates were loudly talking about how being gay was disgusting and wrong. No one knew I was gay and I was struggling to accept myself. I wanted to cry that day. 


High school was a terrible time. "
"It wasn't a waste but well....you gotta move on....he will eventually marry a woman, cheat on her with a man and hate himself to appease his family and then grow to hate himself even more and it will repeat over and over because he's a weak person. This is not me being mean. I pity the guy. He was stupid. He had an obvious choice and he picked the bad end. It's like the end of Dragon Quest where the final boss asks you if you want half of the world in return for not fighting him....if you say yes....it's obvious he will kill you. And he picked that ending. You gotta move on. My husband and I both have depression but we would never choose that. But you gotta know you are strong and you will find the right guy for you! "
Don't forget cop too.  Its not like they are valued sexually in the gay community at all.
"What a horrible thing for someone to say. While it's true that these type of movements will sometimes claim innocent victims due to inertia and a ""guilty before proven innocent"" approach, to say these people should be willing to sacrifice themselves for the cause is beyond awful.

"I see a lot of responses here telling you to ""forget him, he's not your friend"".

How shallow, and self\-centered.

Put yourself in your friend's shoes for a minute: He's known you for ten years, you have been very close, and yet he had no clue you were gay.

You sent him a text message that you were gay.

I have no idea what is going on in his head, but that's bound to mess somebody's head up.

Or he may be ignoring it because he thought it was just a joke.

You need to sit him down one on one, and really talk to him about it.

He may need some time to process it. Think how long it took you to come to grips with it yourself.

But surely as hell it doesn't make sense to throw away a close friendship of ten years, simply because you can't both take time to process?

If he's truly your friend, give him a few days to process things.

Assure him this changes nothing between you, and that you're not trying to hit on him.

And, just in case, prepare yourself in case he can't deal with it.

But don't dump him until you give him a real chance to cope.

Also, don't take this to heart until you know what's really happening, you may be looking for problems that aren't really there, too.

But never walk away from a long friendship too quickly.

Your relationship \*is\* likely to change, but if you get through this little roadblock/speed bump, you may end up even better friends when you can be yourself around him, and he can know the real you.

Try not to burn your bridges by over\-reacting to his reactions, when he may be having a hard time accepting that you ""hid"" this from him for ten years.

In the meantime, I'm so sorry you are hurting, and I sincerely hope you have some friends that you can turn to for support until you and your friend can get things sorted out.

Don't let yourself read too much into his actions until you know for sure what's up with him, and even then, allow him some time to adjust to the new reality.

Sending you lots of love and hugs, babe."

"My most homophobic experience was my junior year of undergrad.

At the end of the spring semester of my sophomore year I wasn‚Äôt able to find a friend who wanted to split a dorm room with me, so I let resident services put who ever they want into my room for my junior year.

As it happened there was an uptick in freshman enrollment my junior year, so they had to over flow some of the freshman men into upperclassmen floors in the one men‚Äôs dorm (which I was in, the other dorms were either coed upperclassmen dorms or womens dorms - the college was like 2/3rds women).  So a freshman was assigned with me.  Fine.  I‚Äôm a nice guy, I survived freshman year, and I would be happy to show him the ropes and introduce him to my friends.

I was working on campus over the summer, so I was able to move into my dorm room a week before the freshman arrived.  When the freshman moved in I popped into the room a couple of times during the day, trying to catch the guy so I could say hi and introduce myself.  Towards the end of the day I managed to catch him, and I introduced myself.  He said that it was nice to meet me, and that he had seen the rainbow sticker on my loft.  His exact comment was **‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a nice guy, but I don‚Äôt want to be around *that*.‚Äù** (just as an aside picture a blond, corn-fed farm twunk complete with boots and flannel)

So the kid went to resident services to get a room change, but was told that he‚Äôd have to wait a few weeks.  In the meantime he didn‚Äôt want to be around ‚Äúthe gay‚Äù so much that he willingly commuted 70mi round trip from our college to his parents‚Äô house in Alabama.  And I will give resident services and the Dean of Students office credit, that they handled things really well and were sensitive to me as a gay student (which is great since my college didn‚Äôt really used to be sensitive to GLBT issues in general).  And they said the kid was in the wrong, and that I handled everything well.

The kid eventually got his room change, and I got an entire two person room to myself for no extra cost.

Here‚Äôs the funny part of the story.  Resident Services has asked me to keep this quiet while the mess was going on, so I did.  But some friends asked me how the situation with my roommate was going after school had started.  As it turns out, the RAs gossip.  My RA had mentioned the situation to some other RAs, who mentioned it to my friends lol."
"We can't be too upset that most of the demographic here are younger. They are less likely to be out, or otherwise have a large social circle of gay/gay-friendly people to talk to, so they do all their talking and asking here. All we can do is teach them.

It's hard as a youngen when you are trying to identify with your male peers, that many do not find men sexually attractive. 'Surely they must! Look how hot men are! Look how *I* am feeling! *Everyone* must also feel this way!' I'm 27 and there are gay guys my age who still make comments, or say things to me like 'what about so and so, he's a bit camp isn't he? I bet he is (gay)! When so and so has had a steady female partner for many years. They're the ones that annoy me. They never even query bisexual, always 'must be gay', as that's what they are. Very self absorbed for late 20s.

Then again there is another peak at this age (25-32) of trying to on with straight guys: I theorise that there are a large proportion of closeted bisexual men. If we go with the estimate that 5% of men are gay and 10% are bi, you should have 15% of the population attracted to the same sex. But bi men rarely come out because firstly, biphobia (particularly by women) causes them to lose their sex appeal to women (I have had many female friend say that a history of any same sex behaviour in a guy is an instant deal-breaker). Secondly, gay men have a habit of *easing* out of the closet by coming out as bi first (fair enough if you were still figuring it out, but many weren't) only to come out as gay later. It makes people believe that all bi men are justs 'gays in waiting', which is unfair.

But anyway back to this peak. It causes single, closeted bisexual men to be drawn to gay guys for sexy times, while saying they are 'straight', which feeds into the myth that ""all men want men some times"". They don't, these were just bisexual men and always were.

I feel for bisexual men. I think life can be even harder for them. You come out and you have half the people you are attracted to being 'turned off', and the other half resenting you for not being a 'real' gay and for 'trying to have both'. Maybe they just fucking do want both, ya judgey ass people.

But 85% of men are straight, and only straight and must be respected and accepted."
So if I am 25 I'll be single forever? Why come at me like this OP!

"The one and only time I tried hitting on a guy in a straight club a few years back. I said I thought he was handsome and smiled. He responded by grabbing me by the neck and pulling me towards him so I could hear him better then proceeded to threaten to beat the shit out if me if I ever interacted with him again and that included even a random bump because the club was crowded so it was best if I got the fuck out of there while he was feeling generous enough to let me go without a punch to the face. 

Some people just can't take a compliment. Insecure fuckhead.... "
"&gt; you don‚Äôt hear this shit from the lesbians.

I do. Maybe most gay men don't because they don't pay any attention to lesbians. Lesbians just have a different set of in-group/out-group rules, often relating to butch/femme/trans roles, politics, and vegetarianism. Gay men tend to break into factions based on body type, sibilance, and divas."
"Even worse, I casually mentioned my boyfriend in a job interview. Ended up getting the job though (which I still have) maybe because, as I found out later, *all three* of my boss's siblings are gay. I'm aware that probably used up a lifetime supply of karma."
"I disagree. I think people confuse ""equality"" for ""being just like straight people"" and that's a dangerous mistake to make.

Gay culture exists because it fills a need. It's absolutely fine to be straight-acting, and to be passively accepted by a permissive culture. That's fine. In fact that's more than fine - that's the goal, for a lot of us.

What's not fine is that not everybody gets that luxury - some people can't, don't or won't conform to what mainstream society thinks of as being ""acceptable"". They don't get to be comfortable in the communities they were born into. They have to find new communities. **That is why the gay community exists**.

So this is why I get mad when people equate gay rights with ""we're just like you"". We aren't, not all of us. Not all of us get to be respectable. What we always, always are, is worthy of respect. This is why I wish gay people would think before throwing the rest of us under the bus. "

EDIT: Just to clarify,  I had a vaguely similar situation. Moved to a new flat, told the main roommate I was gay and that my boyfriend was going to visit me; he was totally cool with it. The other roommate less so, and made a couple of weird comments as well as avoiding me. I ignored him until he started to be civil and cordial. A few months later, he left.

As long as you are a good roommate and respect rules, his preferences are not to be taken into account. Stand your ground."

I started to pull it out of the pocket and he started giggling, I knew something was up. The ribbon was tied around a ring box. He asked me to marry him. I think it goes without saying, I said Yes. I honestly doubt anyone will top that moment in my life. "

I understand your frustration. Str8 men and women know within milliseconds whether or not there is a sexual interest. They cross paths in every aspect of life so the frequencies they emit to one another are constant and consistent. Most straight guys have some degree of certainty if a girl wants their cock. And a woman will have absolutely NO DOUBT if a man wants her kit kat. We gays on the other hand must navigate these mine fields with panic and little possibility of reward. Ugh üò£

"Let's not forget gay people were instrumental in the Civil Rights movement, but the black community at that time was happy to use us and move on. Baynard Rustin was a major player in organizing the March On Washington, but had to stay entirely behind the scenes because both friend and foe didn't approve of his being gay. Martin Luther King Jr. never really addressed it, other than an advice column in Ebony magazine in which he described having gay feelings as not innate, but learned. Kinda leads me to believe he didn't approve, that he advocated gay conversion therapy for overcoming the gayness. [Some people say he would be an advocate, some say otherwise.](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/16/what-did-mlk-think-about-gay-people/) Who knows. 

It sounds like people project their own biases onto King in order to use him to back their positions. 

When gays asked for the black community's help in the 80's, most said no. 

[NPR had a good article on it from 2012.](https://www.npr.org/2012/05/22/153282066/blacks-gays-and-the-church-a-complex-relationship) Old allies of King's led a march from his tomb to protest gay marriage.

"&gt;I used to be susceptible to it.

"Yeah they usually tell me ""I'm negative and on PreP""

To which I reply ""so am I. Still wrapping it up!""

Then they either block me or go silent, although last week one guy continued to send me pics of his ass (it was a nice ass btw) and I finally said ""if you need my load that bad you may take the used condom with you"".

He blocked me after that. I laughed.

I have one very good friend w/ benefits and a couple fuck buddies and we don't bareback, so if someone blocks me over my insistence on condoms it's not a big deal.

Edited to add : only seem to have this problem with guys younger than 30. Guys my age and up don't make an issue of me wrapping it up. "
"Yah, I'd be down with that. Not because I'm trying to set you back but, if that's what you like, then glad you were upfront with it. For me it works because I was raised to be the breadwinner. So my thing is, I will continue that, and if someone I meet wants to be at home and take care of the housekeeping/home making, I'm all good with that. People contribute in many different ways, so it doesn't have to be dollar for dollar match in order for this to be a fair partnership.  I thought it was going to be like that with my current partner. I basically created a situation where he could explorer anything he wanted to do, and not worry about finances. He just needed to help me out with other things. Well, that didn't happen. I now am the breadwinner and homemaker/housekeeper. He drinks, smokes pot, and plays video games. So as long as you're not a mooch and pull your weight. Then it's all good. So that's what I think it boils down to, the hetro traditional roles. "

That's some christian cult shit right there
"Yes, unfortunately for so many young people, the internet is all they get for an outside look into 'gay world', so what they see and absorb is such a small percentage of what homosexuality encompasses. When this is all that you see, suddenly you feel like you need to fall in line because you want to be apart of the community and if that's how the community acts, then that must be the way it is and no one is telling you otherwise because there is no one to tell you otherwise. 
It took me a loooong time to learn that Queer as Folk is not how all gay men live. "
"IMHO, the ""I'm not stereotypically gay"" is pretty much an extension of the male culture's disdain for things that are feminine.  Women and feminine-acting men are second-class, and are there to be used.  Many straight men (it's worse in some cultures than others) look upon women generally as inferior in strength and position, and they look upon gay men who are not masculine the same way, or worse.

This is a crass generalization; not all masculine guys (gay or straight) feel this way.  But a lot of the world's cultures do."

Middle of the afternoon, I got to his room, knock, open the door and there he is lying on his side on the bed with his ass facing me!! (I can still picture his ass, hairy crack and all! ) I backed out slowly and closed the door. Later, I gave him hell. ""What the hell are you doing taking a naked nap in the middle of the day??!!

You're not alone in that. I I'm in more need of intimacy that I am in need of sex. I read article once it said If you're looking for love or you're looking for sex these are things that you can give yourself. And it's true. You can give yourself love you can give yourself sucks and they can be fulfilling and strong and powerful. But I'm of the mindset that you cannot give yourself intimacy. In order to achieve that you do need someone there. I wish guys could understand the difference in that sometimes a hookup doesn't need to it lead to penetration and or even orgasm. Sometimes laying in bed naked with a guy holding each other and kissing each other can very much be enough.

"A german investigative journalist analysed all the rape claims women made during NYE in 2016 and the year after and basically revealed that the majority of them were fake and a ton of the women weren't even close to the city, nor did the number of people in the crowd match the offical police statements and cctv.

One of the more famous cases, were a Russian woman claimed together with a bar owner that she was raped, turned out to be a lie. She wasn't even in the country. Now she has been found murdered and all leads point to her accomplice.

It is amazing how the metoo and other movements actually helped rape victims come forward and be more confident, but it was hijacked by the wrong people. Blind trust is never good. Innocent until proven guilty. And the news should never show the image of the accused until he is proven guilty. This ruins lives."

That was like one person who wasn't even the most upvoted


&gt; This saddens me. AGB is my only reach to a gay community and now I feel like it's corrupted.


You know... I always wonder how other people see the world and if their accounts of reality are real or just so incredibly distorted it's practically bullshit... You definitely fall into the latter category.

"I‚Äôve read a lot of people say their parents don‚Äôt know their position in bed, and I wanted to share the info my son and I shared with each other! 

It‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed of 

He maaaay have gone a little too into detail about the whole process, but seeing that smile on his face couldn‚Äôt have made me happier. "
"You may want to explore that .01 % 
You never know until u try it, you might enjoy it.

"You're fine. A different hairstyle/haircut would be good for you, though, don't you think?"
Sounds like you two aren't really that great of friends after all. It's better to know where you stand by talking to him. Coward's way out is to just avoid it all. 
Time to ditch the bitch and find somebody who isn't filled with hatred. 
"Lol. ""Boy"". Reminds me of Kratos in the new God of War. "
"He was amazing at sucking cock! Mine too, but mostly anyone who sent him a dick pic."
i stuck my tongue in my ex‚Äôs mouth and licked all around when he was sick so he wouldnt have to go through it alone. im a great bf and im taking applications 
"well that is really coincidental 

&gt; otherwise I should have just dove in

also don't rape sleeping people"
"As a top you just described my ideal relationship. Wife-ing up a cute boy to be the stay at home mom for our children when I bring home the bacon sounds like Nirvana. 

Bottoms that enjoy that sort of heteronormative femininity really bring out the man in me. I'm hard just writing this. "
"Everything...seriously, I can't put my finger on it but I find it very attractive."
Haha I know the feeling! I feel the same. Love taking care of my hubby.
"When i was 26 i was surrounded while walking home by a group of teenagers. Initially it was the usual insults, i tried to reason with them, then i was literally begging them to please let go home. I could see it in their eyes and body language that i was not talking my way out of it but i still tried.

Next thing I knew I was on the ground with them stamping on my face. I don't remember how I was knocked down but I felt stunned for a while. All the time I kept pleading for them to stop and for someone to help (it happened in a residential area,people could see it happening) eventually I gave up, it was one of the few times in my life that I genuinely thought that I was going to die, and I just gave up.

When they eventually stopped and left, I continued to just lay there, I am not sure if it was because I was in shock or just relieved. I managed to get myself home and did not leave for a week. They had broken out four of my front teeth on top , the damage was so bad that my dentist had to remove most of my teeth over time (pre-existing condition also led to me losing all of my teeth top and bottom). After this I rarely left home for years, and did not come out to anyone  until my mid thirties.

Even though I am quite big, I still get anxious near groups of teenagers and avoid them whenever I can particularly in my home town. I moved out the day that I came out to my mom and sister, I knew that I could not live in that town anymore."
"You tell her that‚Äôs just fine, and you hope she‚Äôs okay with never meeting her future grandchildren because you won‚Äôt expose them to that hatred. We‚Äôll see how she feels a few years down the road when all her friends are excited to have all the grandkids over for Christmas and she has an empty house. "
"I get pissed off when anyone is racist.

And maybe it's just me, but here on gay reddit racist comments/posts are downvoted into oblivion. At least in my experience. "
"you forget ""I just had sex today"" and ""I just got fucked"",also ""I'm a female and think my boyfriend might be gay"""
"or on Grindr, more like 10"
"be rough and fuck me senseless but be vulnerable and want to cuddle afterwards

no homo"
"There was a rare moment last summer where my bf was out of town for a week, my one roommate was away for a weekend and the other roommate was house sitting for some friends for a couple of weeks. I had that weekend off and just stayed inside, played games, cranked my music and drank cider the whole weekend.

I love having time to myself :P"
*proceeds to slowly walk backwards*
"As a 41 -year-old gay man who was about 10 years too young to lose all his friends to AIDS, but old enough to know what could happen if I don't protect myself, all of this barebacking is absolutely insane to me.  

What's more, I've seen so many discussions on here over the years of people going ""oh‚Ä¶ I didn't know that's what it could do to you"" when a picture of a late stage AIDS victim is shown.   

The truth is, once the drug cocktails came out in 1996 and straight people quit paying attention, a lot of the education went away.  Now that the online world has made gay life as hedonistic as it was in the 70s, all bets are off.  

In some ways the younger generation has a lot easier‚Ä¶ And someways a lot harder. I feel for you guys having to try to actually find relationships on these casual sex apps... 

:("
Almost daily but not when I'm with my boyfriend because actual sex stuff.

"Why is the response to this always in relation to PrEP and HIV? Drug resistant syphilis exists now and arguably, with modern treatment available for HIV, that is more dangerous than HIV. Syphilis causes sores and rashes in the short term but it‚Äôs long term effects are much more serious. Long term untreated syphilis can cause blindness and damage to internal organs. This internal organ damage includes heart failure and dementia. Untreated syphilis then leads to death. 

The more common drug resistant syphilis becomes the more likely these long term effects of syphilis will be realised as syphilis will be untreatable again. "
Gay men go to bars; lesbians go to potlucks. 
"Just curious. Does he know you're ""not attracted to him""? "
"Yes yes YES.

If you are black and/or of a minority and e.g. black and homophobic or homosexual and racist then you're an idiot and it makes no sense tbh. As a minority, you should know how it feels to be oppressed etc so why do it yourself?"
I'm a huge Asian dude and havent stepped foot in a gym at 6 foot 240 I need to get that bara powerlifter life going. Enough fantasy and I need to start fucking living the bear life.
Well damn now I want a bf even more and am rock solid...
"Lol I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd call a boyfriend not by his name either, it‚Äôs not really me to do that, and I don‚Äôt even like the sound of that"
"It‚Äôs only cute if you, yourself, don‚Äôt get sick as a result."
"Only if we officially hold clinical trials of this method with a second ""control"" group of guys who don't follow the rules and then compare 1) the number of straight dicks sucked by each group and 2) the number of important friendships ruined."
Wow she doesn‚Äôt sound very smart 
"You should have replied ""your date tonight""

AHHHH would have been so smooth

ask for his number next time. Also this is pretty damn close to flirting. Customers don't give a shit about what their salesperson's name is unless they had ulterior motives :P"
I play paintball and made a lot of really good looking friends who don't mean a lot.

"Uh you know that‚Äôs just a description of your body type, right?"
"How is a post calling muscular Asian dudes hot a ""moment"" for Asian guys? OP is right, it's just the poster's sex drive talking, so unless it's specifically a compliment to you I don't see how that is validating. If anything it comes across as condescending to treat it as post-worthy that hot Asian guys are hot."
"Be yourself and always play safe. 

Don't take shit but don't look for shit either. 

Drama is a waste of time. 

Do not be hung up on finding ""the one"". People I know who were / are always looking for ""the one"" are the ones who stress about it too much. 

If you're yourself people that you would want in your life will naturally be attracted to you through real connections. 

Most important: Invent a time-travelling or de-aging machine for me. (41...what is this shit?)

P.s. To hell with you saying 30 is old. In fact, DO THE OPPOSITE of everything I just said and get THE HELL off my lawn!!! ;) "
Who are the assholes you're telling?  I'd either find more mature guys to tell or just stop mentioning it.
"I encounter people who try to paint me as ""not"" stereotypical gay all the time. I ask them to explain. They give me the usual, you don't speak it don't act it and I'm not flamboyant. I end up having a conservation about how stereotypical their view on gay men is. The example of ""Black is black no matter how black you talk"". At the end of the day, I like dick as much as the flamboyant gay man. 

People will do what ever it takes to make themselves comfortable first and not realize they are doing it. When you shatter that for them they actually have to think about their bull shit. "
"I lost hope after Sandy Hook. If a bunch of dead 6 year olds didn‚Äôt make any difference, nothing will. 

I don‚Äôt get mad anymore, just really sad and ashamed. "
"Great, you just found a good filter on people to avoid. Always have safe sex."
HEELS CLICK CLACKIN' ABOUT
"That was pretty much the point of /r/gaybros before it turned into a general purpose gay sub. I feel totally straight except for the whole ""exclusively fucking guys"" thing. "
