"As I mentioned in the comments on one of my other posts lately, Boss passed away suddenly earlier this year.  I still called him a friend even more than 15 years after I worked for him.  This is why I wrote up more of these stories about him.  I have enjoyed writing about him for you, and smile that his quiet competence, kind heart, and large laugh have been enjoyed by many more people.  I hope that maybe someday I will make the kind of positive impact on others as Boss made on me, but that's a mighty hard act to follow.

I don't think Boss ever realized just how talented he was.  He didn't think he really deserved that much credit for these things, because to him, it was so easy and natural he barely had to think about it at all.

edit: thanks for the gold, Internet stranger!"
"Yeah, I've been there. ""What's that noise sir?""

"Have her boss authorize the needed upgrades to fulfill her request, coming out of her bosses budget obviously, and see if she keeps asking. 2 scenarios she’ll be fired for harassing you or shel will be told not to bother you."
"Impressive reasoning. Dumb, but impressive."
Never realized that the facepalm was really the brain trying to escape.
But everything that doesn't work is a conspiracy against users - all the IT people are in on it!

"Maybe I'm just getting cruel in my old age, but I'd be tempted to set up a BYOD AP, and set up a DHCP pool with only 1 address and a 5 minute lease and open it up to everybody.  Problem solved and point made all in one go.  Welcome to DHCP Battledome! "
"yeah, honestly. I feel like OP failed in his advisory role if the conclusion understood was: it will run just not well."
"Skimping on RAM is the #1 facepalm I see in office computer deployments.  Looking at a secretary struggling to get stuff done on their computer, noticing the hard drive light is pegged on as it swaps its guts out... yep, the people who spec 'em ought to be made to use 'em.

The #2 facepalm is being too cheap to spec a small SSD as system disk, so the OS can remain responsive through the never-ceasing corporate policy/security enforcement disk activity."
"It's only 5 years away.  Which, as someone born in the early 70s, strikes me as utterly bizarre."

This is great. I imagine an old switchboard operator just plugging things in all Willy nilly and ending up not moving the call. 
"Personally I think that she is good for another 20 years! She lives alone on a small farm and still collects the eggs daily. Her grandson stacks her firewood and brings it into the house for her, but aside from that she pretty much does it all herself, and still drives herself into town. "
"Roaming is part of the network stored profile, if the profile is stored on a network drive. It's the stuff you bring with you when you log in to another computer.

Local is stuff that you keep at the specific computer in question. Typically caches and other ""nice to have, but eh if it's lost"" stuff."
I used to work customer service for a large hated ISP and I took phone calls everyday in which customers would describe situations exactly like that. 
"As a newly minted IBM marketing rep in the early 90's trying to sell the PS/2 range into the local University I came across this exact question.  ""Are they IBM compatible?""  Still bemuses me.  We did end up fitting out a couple of labs with model 30s and model 50s though only after an extensive trial period - part of which involved the newly released 'Wolfenstein' game.

"Sounds like he really was a hell of a mentor and friend.  My sympathies for your loss, but thank you so much for sharing the memories of this great person.

Also, my inner BOFH approves greatly of his methods, so i'll drain a cold lager in his memory, and maybe chase it with a nice vindaloo.

Edit - additional coffee allowed me to spot spelling/grammar issue."

"My *favorite* CEO support example was a company I worked for where \(in 1999\-ish\) the CEO decided to buy a fancy laptop while on vacation and, being the CEO, could say that it was now his work laptop.

Which would have been fine.

Except, this was 1999 so the laptop ran Windows 95 \(we were an NT shop\) and was a Japanese\-only model that had poor to no driver support for English versions, apparently. Getting the keyboard to work took way too many tech hours, and then there was the proprietary external CD\-ROM drive and such. 

It was, however, a remarkably thin and lightweight laptop."
"The most metal way to die.

Yeah i'm horrible, I know."
I had a user tell me that the internet was out.  She showed me by opening word and typing her url and hitting enter....   this was a small cutting edge software startup.  How she got hired is beyond me. 
"Once upon a time I had a contract to go through a giant load of used computer equipment purchased from the US government by a Native American tribe, and make as many systems capable of running their preferred desktop software mix as I could.

Most of them were PS/2 machines that absolutely couldn't cut it at all, a 386 processor was required. However, they were very clear that the tribal legislature had approved fixing existing machines, including replacing hardware, but would have to vote to approve any purchase of NEW machines, and that this vote would at best take forever and likely fail.

I prepared two quotes. One was for replacing each machine with an acceptable machine, preserving the keyboard, mouse, and video monitor and disposing of the rest. That was approximately $750. The other quote was for replacing the motherboard with a third\-party piece designed to fit into the PS/2 case and use its disk drives etc. That was approximately $1,500 per machine.

Guess which quote was approved."

"When asking customers where the printer they are calling a trouble ticket on is located at they often just say ""oh - just down the hall a bit"".  Sometimes I imagine them holding up the phone so I can see for myself.  "
"&gt;So, I double click the ""e"" for internet, and then click the little ""Home"" icon.  That takes me to the Microsoft page. Then I type ""Google"" into the search bar and click the third link for Google. Then, I type what I want into the Google, click ""Google Search"", and it gives me results! Easy!

You know you can just type it into the address bar, right?

&gt;Oh, I don't know how to do that, I'll keep doing it my way, it's much simpler."
"Isn't the traditional fix for this is sacrificing a virgin? If so, then compsci interns should give you a good pool to choose from."
"Bad idea. As soon as you try to rationalise your actions with someone like this, you’re playing their game. And they’re better at it than you.

What would actually happen: They won’t listen to reason, they’ll instead “hear” something that fits their narrative. Something like “I don’t want to do my job”. And before you know it they’ve emailed everyone up the management chain complaining of how useless you are.

To be fair, it’s seldom their complaints are taken seriously. But it’s an argument you don’t need to have."

"no, see, that's why you have it go off the budget. You make it crazy expensive (supply and demand and all that) and make it very clear to her boss she _can_ work as is, just prefers not to."
Why is someone computer-illiterate even touching equipment like that?
At some point in the long-term plans (after I get my VLAN switches) I'll do that and throttle the guest-guest network to 1Mb/s.

"For me it was IT maintaining a 32bit os corporate wide in order to maintain support for a single legacy printer. We are talking about 3,000 plus Dell workstations with 8gb of ram all running Windows 10 32bit!

"Users will come up with the craziest, most convoluted solution to a very simple problem."
"I think phones generally say PIN when it's actually the SIM card PIN, which is separate from the lock screen code (passcode, pattern, whatever). So it wouldn't necessarily be the same thing. Although the user might not be aware of the difference and have them set to the same combination."

"at my prior job some girl brought her iPad in and put it on the Wifi.  shes a sales agent and is supposed to be making calls and you know, salesing.
Im look through reports for our wifi and see one device thats using more bandwidth then all the other devices combined. Pull the hostname ""&lt;salesGirls&gt; iPad""...
Send off an IM

""Hey &lt;salesGirl&gt; I see your iPad is using a lot of bandwidth. Can you tell me what youre using it for?""

the reply I get ""Why? its none of your business""

uhm, hi, im NetOps. It is EXACTLY my business

i reply to the IM with ""I dont see a current device approval for your iPad, if you tell me what your using it for I can just take care of it, otherwise im going to have to kick it off the network.""

&lt;salesGirl&gt; ""You cant do that. if you MUST know im watching netflix""

OOOOOK and mac ban

20 minuets later the COO (he came over with a company that we just aquired a few months prior) strolls into my office.

COO: ""Did you kick &lt;salesGirl&gt; off the network?""

me:""No, just her personal iPad. She didnt have a device approval and she was using it to watch netflix during work hours and was using more bandwidth then every other device on the wifi combined.""

COO: ""hmm well you cant kick her off the network, she needs to work""

Me: ""Her PC is still online and connected to the network, she can work just fine""

COO: ""Great, and unban her iPad too""

Me: ""I cant do that.  She is in violation of company policy.  If there is a problem with that you are free to take it up with my boss &lt;CTO&gt;""

COO: ""I dont think that will be necessary""

So fast forward 2 days and here again is &lt;salesGirls&gt; iPad on the wifi chewing up bandwidth. Check the logs ""&lt;salesGirls&gt; iPad unbaned by &lt;COO&gt;""

Oh... OK... NOPE

log into the APMS and set a new rule (&lt;salesGilrs&gt; iPad MAC) throttle to 5kbp/s

log the change.

fast forward an hour, COO comes back into my office

COO ""Did you ban &lt;salesGirls&gt; iPad again?""

Me ""Nope, but I did see you unbanned it even after I told you she was in violation of the companies policies.  I also see that the unban wasnt logged which means it didnt go through &lt;CTO&gt;, thats another violation of the companies policies.""

COO ""Well I over see those policies and I decided to make an exception, so unban her iPad and dont do it again""

Me ""Like I already told you, and you can check, I didnt ban her iPad.  For the record &lt;COO&gt; you dont oversee those policies.  Those are IT policies and they are handled by us here in NetOps and overseen by &lt;CTO&gt;.  Ill let him know that there seems to be some confusion about how IT policies get handled and that we should schedule a meeting for everyone who came over in the acquisition just to make sure we are all on the same page since im sure your prior company handled these issues differently.""

Yes I know, I sound like an asshole, BUT CEO and President of the company put NetOps in charge of these things after a poor choice in handling policy and personal devices (not by NetOps) resulted in the primary accounting server being infected with ransomware (prior to the COO coming on board)


The nice thing is my boss the &lt;CTO&gt; stood behind my decision.  While the COO can ban and unban devices (didnt agree with that at all) he wouldnt have a clue how to check for throttling rules LOL

Netflix at 5kbp/s

hell ANYTHING at 5kbp/s

Like sucking cement through a straw LOL"
