"The doctors will know how to help you. There's even an official ICD-10 code for ""bitten by a duck"" that they can submit to your insurance, lol. W61.61x"
Get regularly checked for skin cancer. No joke.
Did this myself lol what worked for me was just taking duct tape and sliding it against the card as best as I could and using a thin bit of metal or wood to get it to really stick to the card and pulling it out that way. I used a spark plug feeler gauge and it worked perfectly

"The funniest thing about this is:

https://icd10coded.com/cm/ch20/W50-W64/W61/W61.61/

&gt; The appropriate 7th character is to be added along with any placeholders (X) necessary to establish a 7-digit ICD 10 code.

&gt; W61.61XA - Bitten by duck
&gt; Use this code for initial encounter

&gt; W61.61XD - Bitten by duck
&gt; Use this code for subsequent encounter

Now I'm going to assume it just means a follow up with a doctor on infection or something, but it just really amuses me that someone might end up having to go back to the doctor to talk about the duck that's bullying him."
"Doctor here.
You need shots. Go see someone within the next 12hours "
You're a saint!!! It worked. I guess it's true duct tape fixes everything. 
I can't breathe. *Subsequent encounter!* Oh my fucking god.

"No question. Tans happen as a result to exposure to damaging uv light. ANY uv exposure leads to skin cell damage. Skim cell damage gives rise to skin cancer. The theory of getting a tan to protect ourselves is total bunk. ANY time you spent tanning was adding to the damage. The least risk is basal cell because it's cancer with training wheels. Squamous cell is next and then the worst, melenoma. Blond hair and fair skin is a sure tip off that you are most likely to get cancer.

For the life of me if the government really worked to keep us safe than tanning salons would be out of business. Politics though....

Look, nothing looks better to me than a NATURAL person.

Not a bad idea. That duck sounds like it had something wrong with it. If you're embarrassed about the duck part just say it was a condor or a harpy eagle or something.
Did you tell the tanning salon what happened? Maybe you could have scored some free tan coupons.
Ive been attacked by swans and pit bulls.  I am an animal lover. My advice is this the Reality of the world is you meet agression with agression. If you would have turned and kicked the duck after the first bite he would have thought twice about the second bite. Now you got rabies and duck aids.
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance

"Veterinarian here. It would be medically inappropriate for me to suggest anything other than ""see a physician"". But also, don't listen to people saying the duck has rabies. Ducks are not a rabies vector species. It is highly unlikely the duck attacked because of meningial parasitism, toxoplasma, or some other incredibly rare behaviour-altering illness - it's probably demonstrating territorial aggression, a common trait in autumn. In general, systemic zoonotic disease transmissible via duck saliva is very uncommon; routine wound infection due to contamination from the bird's mouth is not uncommon, and you should clean that really deeply and thoroughly with alcohol, iodine, or chlorhexidine."
I've been doing it wrong the whole time!

"same thing happened to my friend. we all got rooms in a hotel for a wedding weekend, and all the guys w/o dates split rooms to save money.

my one friend is iranian and is an extremely terrible drinker. always gets black out drunk and makes a fool of himself. anyways, sure enough the first night there he vomits all over the bed he was supposed to split with another person (he also vomited the next night but not on the bed).

the person who was supposed to share the bed with him was invited to go in on my other friend's room instead. he split the cost of the other room by sending money on venmo with the note ""iranian refugee crisis"" and had the same problem as you."

"Holy crap, that's terrible. When I was 8, my parents and I went to the Florida Keys for 2 weeks (like we did at least once a year). On the second day, my mom had a modeling gig, so my dad took me to the beach. We were out from 8am until sunset, and my dad didn't put a single drop of sunscreen on me. I'm also very pale and (as a child) blonde. I got second degree burns (sun poisoning) on my entire back, back of my neck, shoulders, back of my legs, back of my arms, and parts of my face. I spent the remaining 12 days of the vacation laying on white sheets with bottles of aloe vera, medicine, and water, vomiting, crying and watching TV. Terrible. I truly shudder at the thought of this happening to you.

That was pretty much the last time I ever went into the sun without protection, and probably the last time I ever truly enjoyed the beach. 

Oh, PS, my mom divorced my dad by the end of that calendar year.

"I had a melanoma on my upper arm removed in 1996. Regular checkups after that them hit the five year home free mark. In 2015 I had a bad cough. Decided to go to ER as I was having trouble breathing. They have me a nebulizer treatment then the doctor decided to do a chest x-ray to check for pneumonia. They found 'something' so I ended up with a CT scan. Found out it presented as a tumor so PET scans, biopsies, the works were done. 
Ended up getting a second opinion at Sloan in NYC and they had clinical trials going so I jumped on board. Tumor has shrunk over 90% and after 2 1-2 years I'm no longer on treatment. :)
Oddly enough the cough had nothing to do with it. I thank God regularly for that cough as it could have been worse. 
Keep getting checked and try not to worry. They've made great strides in treatment of melanoma. :)
