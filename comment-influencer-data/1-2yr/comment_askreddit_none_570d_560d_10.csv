I knew when the show got popular that america was pretty much over. anyone who likes that show if a fucking retard.
Your wife will probably cheat on you on a girls trip because you're a pathetic drunk that is too fat to satisfy her sexually

You're assuming this lady doesn't have a disability herself.  Be the bigger person.
Yep.Travyon Martin was 17 when he tried to kill George Zimmerman. Michael Brown was bigger than most grown men at 16. He was probably bigger than the store clerk he was pushing around when he was only 14

"AR-15's are semi-automatic. in fact, most assault rifles in civilian hands are NOT fully automatic. and in many states, full auto ARs arent even allowed. to own a full auto AR, you would have to buy one made before 1986, cost a fuckton of money, and needs to be approved by NFRTR. many attachments, like silencers, are also heavily restricted"
I don‚Äôt see a lot of overlap between the groups of people that are pro-choice and pro-gun. Try again. 
"Firepower isn't why we struggle against groups like that. Neither side can ever win or lose.

I think someone's an idiot if they think a tyrannical government that makes armed revolution necessary is realistically possible in the modern era here. We have peaceful means of controlling who's in charge, and a separation of powers to prevent any from going too crazy. We don't have a king. That's why I call this a fantastical idea. Then you get into the idea of actually beating the US military with civilian weaponry, and getting enough support for such a cause. The American Revolution was muskets vs muskets. Best case scenario is creating a prolonged conflict where neither side is happy. "
Oooh aren't you good. /s
Self-defense doesn‚Äôt make sense to you? Having the right to be armed as a check against an oppressive government doesn‚Äôt make sense to you?

Well I hope he sued, as he had the right to. I don't know why people feel they have the right to hurt somebody just because they have committed a crime that they consider is 'too far'.

"&gt; to find a woman

I think the crux of your ""argument"" needs to be specified here. If by ""finding a woman,"" you mean settling down with a woman once she is past her sexual prime, then sure, that's not particularly hard. It's also not hard to get laid with fat women or ugly women (e.g. red haired feminists, weirdos, etc.). If you're talking about fucking that 9/10 who's 21 and has her pick of dick, then yeah, you better bet your ass that only top-tier men get laid that way."

"You should look up Australian gun laws if you want a good bench mark for better gun control. We had one incident back in '96 that drove the government to make gun reforms. The next step for Australia would be the gun laws of the UK. Just a suggestion though.

"Yes, but when choosing from a palette of 8-16 crayons (15 when discounting the useless white crayon), black is a much closer approximation of that deep skin coloring than brown would be."
How do you know? You can't just stick your fingers in your ears and keep telling us America is special. You have to explain *why* diversity or a large population makes gun control impossible.
The only part of him being an idiot is from the sole fact that he doesn't understand that he's overpaying for sex by not directly paying for it. All women are prostitutes. The ones that don't charge up front to be paid to leave are the most expensive ones.

"It's easy when the neighborhood is diverse though since everyone has to deal with a bit of language barrier since there are so many different languages spoken. But when everyone else in the neighborhood shares the same language and you're the one odd man out, it'd be *a lot* more difficult since you're the only one that's forced to make an effort to communicate within the community. I mean, a neighborhood where 99% of the residents speaks Arabic is probably not going to have a Word of the Day in 6 different languages. "

"It's the American patriotic thing to do to go to a place and shoot the fuck out of it and killing people in the process is just part of the fun when you're an American. Americans like to go to war with other countries and topple their governments and killing and raping innocent people there in the process. The reason they allow guns is to control the population via mass shootings and the reason they won't ban guns for the general public. Anyone can get a gun and it's their patriotic duty to obligate the second amendment. After all, guns don't kill people people kill people. It's patriotic to have mass shootings in America because that is what being free is all about. /s LOL Fuck America. It's land of the morons that think they're free FUCKING LOL @ the retards."
