"&gt; I unblocked him on one of my social media accounts and sent him a friendly message. In my message I said that I knew his secret and that although he has been an asshole to me, I wouldn't mind introducing him to other gay people or helping him find LGBT support groups. 

&gt; So I forgave him and once again offered helping him find an LGBT support group. Since we go to the same college, I told him he could hang out with me and my friends if he wanted. 

Dude, you have more maturity than a lot of us could ever dream of. You really handled it well."
Sometimes I say ‚Äúno homo‚Äù and it never fails to make us both laugh like idiots.

"My boyfriend is a doctor and open about his sexuality. In my opinion I think that's a good thing. I really think it's necessary for people (especially Christians) to see that sometimes the people helping them are just normal, caring, compassionate, gays who are trying to make the world a better place. 

If we were married, I would have a hard time with him lying about this. It implies that it's something that should be hidden or that it should be something to be ashamed of when it's not. At the end of the day, you just have to do whatever you're comfortable with and think is best. "
"wait. healthy advice that produced average results? on this sub? 

noo way lol"

"If i see a younger gay teen couple, I'm just like ""D'awww, thats cute. I hope it lasts.""  This one time I was at a local place for lunch, the sight of two high school boys holding hands while eating together made it easier to deal with waiting during the lunch rush. It was so pure, and its great to see how even in a small town area younger guys/girls arent hiding their relationships anymore.

I pretty sure we were all baby gays at one point. My regret was that I didn't full come out until late high school.  "
I once came at the exact same time than a guy in a porno movie...
She was saying how disgusting it is for me to be gay so I wanted to make it worse.

"Perfect!  Also, the servers at Hooters love the gays!  We tip better and don‚Äôt grab them.  

A group of friends and I went to Hooters before a Cher concert.  Our waitress came over, looks at us, and says, you all going to Cher?  We cracked up not thinking we were that obvious.  We asked her how she knew? She pointed to her eyes and then ample breasts, and said, ‚Äúyou looked here not here.‚Äù  She then proceeds to spend the whole time with us and mostly giving all the straight guys there minimal service.  "
i think you might have the gay
"Cheating? 6 months in?   Your initial decision was spot on.

This sounds really sweet. I'll be waiting for an emotional finale post and the plans for your honeymoon shortly.
"I would for now leave him alone.  The primary reason right now is the possibility he is baiting.

If you are sure he is actually gay and talk to him again, don't be a prick.  Be nice and supportive.

That there are other gay people around he knew of and only targeted you, does __suggest__ he is interested in you"

"Lol, you made me realize that 14 year old me would be really pissed if he saw my current life partner. ü§î"
"It's fucking awesome.  But just from a personal preference, the reverse is one of the best things ever.  When he's asleep on your chest and you kiss his head, run your hands through his hair, hold him and protect him.  I think that's what heaven is."

My cat seems to enjoy it. 
"17 on 23 (or whatever you were) is much different than 15 on 37, for the record.

And, yeah, I don't think their relationship is healthy or good for the kid.  As for how to nullify the relationship without him running or harboring some hardcore animosity... I wish I could tell you.  Police can probably be involved (along with informing the school) if it comes to that, homophobia aside."
"Now that you are aware of his situation, run away.

"
"all jokes aside, this is kinda fucked up and I think you should speak to someone in a professional position before you make a mistake that could change both yours and your family's life  "
"No.  By confronting him about it, you‚Äôre only enforcing the idea to him that being gay is something to be ashamed of.  Don‚Äôt hit him up on Grindr and be like ‚Äúwho‚Äôs the sinner now?‚Äù."
"Even more small world, my husband (now, wasn‚Äôt then) also slept with him.  

Ps, LinkedIn has no setting for this."
I wish I could see older gay guys when I was young. Perhaps I wouldn't feel so lonely.
"Every time I'd fuck him, one of my old college boyfriends would turn to me with a really serious expression when we were done and say, ""I... I'm pregnant."""
"If he‚Äôs been talking with that guy for years, and has been cheating...that my friend...hate to say it, is no coincidence.  

That was planned.  "
you either get the best sleep ever or toss and turn the entire night 
"&gt; Should i forgive him?

Forgive him *for yourself*, not for him. Because it's easier to move on and be happy having forgiven someone rather than being stuck with a grudge for years.

But forgiving him does NOT mean taking him back. I don't know you or your relationship, but from my limited perspective I'd say: walk the fuck away. You've been dating for *almost* 6 months, yet he's already been with at least 3 different guys for the past few *weeks*!? The only reason he had this ""epiphany""/commitment to ""never do it again"" is because you found out, and you only found out because his hookups were fucking texting him while you were with him!

He isn't sorry he did it, he's sorry he got caught! If he actually cared about you as much as he claims, he wouldn't have *regularly cheated with multiple men for multiple weeks*. I know it sucks to lose a relationship and you want to believe he can change, but all signs point to no. If someone is willing to cheat once, they're willing to cheat again. Even if he remains dedicated to you for the next 6 months, he's going to get those urges again. How can you expect to have a long-term relationship with someone who can't keep it in their pants for even 6 months?

Nope, nope, nope. Forgive him for your own benefit, and then cut him off. He doesn't deserve you in his life and you deserve better."
There is an excitement about a big dick...but realistically around 6 Inches is the perfect length for me...any bigger and it can be such a hastle

"My father flipped out when I came out because I also revealed I was dating a 19 year old, and I was 15. He would have either murdered a 37 year old or called the police.  That's completely unacceptable.  So no, you are not overreacting. 

Maybe confront the boyfriend directly? In public. Don't want to get you murdered.  But your son is not ready for a relationship with someone that age.  It is illegal and it will also affect him psychologically down the road. 

Which country are you in? Asia is big and diverse.

"Overheard in the locker room a few years back: ""It sounds gay as shit, but that movie really made me want to read the book!"""
"I once overheard some typical straight jocks at my old school call a dustbin that had fallen over ‚Äúgay.‚Äù As in ‚ÄúOh my god, that‚Äôs so fucking gay!‚Äù

I really don‚Äôt like the fact that the word ‚Äúgay‚Äù has simply become a substitute for anything remotely bad. At least it has for 16 year old boys in Belgium. I think that‚Äôs mostly because we use the word ‚Äúhomo‚Äù in Dutch, so for some boys ‚Äúgay‚Äù is a cool word they don‚Äôt necessarily associate with actually being gay."

"Usually the reports are ‚Äúhe stabbed me and went on a murder rampage‚Äù or ‚Äúhe ripped off my clothes right there and now we are married‚Äù.

Coming out in high school is still pretty early. I feel like most still don't come out till after high school. 
Maybe butter fingers needs to just use his own things so that he's more careful. I don't think that's a reason to break up unless he's purposefully doing all of that.
"That's a very noble thought, but I would advise caution. Guys like him are homophobic, and abusive towards other gay people, because they are afraid of their own homosexual feelings. From your description it sounds like he specifically targeted you because something about you tempted him. He might have some serious self-hate that he could turn towrds you. Just let him live his life and follow his own path. When you see him on campus, just be kind.

(Before the concern trolls get in an uproar, I'm not saying all homophobes are secretly gay. But some of them are, and they are often some of the most dangerous.)"
If you act tsundere it'll only make people ship you harder.
Lmao.  That‚Äôs great.  
"Well....allow me to make a point. 

You didn't date him for his driving and parking skills. (Or apparently for his cooking either and for real we aren't even talking about laundry) 

So why did you date him? What made you interested in being his boyfriend? I totally want to know what made you want him?

It is easy enough to decide that homo erectus is way too much trouble, but frequently boys who possess the magic combination of being both cute enough and willing don't actually understand how to operate kitchen appliances. LOL

Does he wear t-shirts while you wear tailored clothes?  Maybe he has never ironed or starched or cared for fine cotton garments? 

Are you a butch guy who drives a high end tuner car? Does he struggle to pass driver's ed because he is a ditzy little girl? 

Everyone is different. **HE** is not a standin for **YOU**. 

My husband is a butch country Alabama boy with a taste for Aqua di Gio cologne and gourmet cooking. BUT--He doesn't know the combination to the gun safe get me? He can't learn it, he can't open it, and GOD HELP US if he did and got a firearm loaded, he would kill the postman trying to check the mail. Meanwhile I am a GUN DUDE...I have a concealed weapon permit, I have often carried a firearm, and they don't make me nervous at all. 

See the difference?  I get that you guys are living together. DO YOUR OWN LAUNDRY SLACKER...and keep him out of the drivers seat of your car, make a place for your computer where IT DOESN'T ever move and then tell him to keep his mitts off the expensiver furnishings. 

Then.....go fuck him stupid till when you ask him who is president he just looks at you with full sated sleepy eyes and asks if he can tell you after he wakes up and by the way he wants some more dick after he has had some sleep. "
"I don't think there's anything immature about being a dick to your bully. However, forgiving/taking the high road is mature.

"The guilt and disgust are internalized from the prevalent culture (and as you mentioned) religious ideals you‚Äôve been brought up by. It‚Äôs just a matter of reminding yourself that experimentation and being true to yourself are completely natural. 

Google Kinsey Scale. Sexuality isn‚Äôt black and white, most people fall on a spectrum. That‚Äôs may help as there is a psychological basis for the scale and will help you to see that you don‚Äôt have to be 100% straight/gay/or even bi.

"Short story: we were hot and horny ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

It's actually not that complicated. He grown more mature due to some personal issues, we accidentally talked once after few years and for the first time there was no hostility, we became friends and when I started coming out to all of my friends, he decided to take the opportunity and make a move. We probably would be only friends with benefits for some time but we clicked really well, so here we are."
"I fooled around for years with my best friend's brother. We are both military guys and fairly masculine. We are talking hundreds of blowjob's and intercourse.

I've come out and have an amazing relationship. He swears he's straight. Hasn't had a girlfriend in a long time, and he currently hangs out consistently with his ""ex gfs"" (they never had sex or were intimate) male cousin. The two are inseparable.

The dieting is causing mood swings and bouts of depression and anxiety. Don't let it overwhelm you. Keep going. Your weight loss is an enormous accomplishment. You should be very proud of yourself.
"I think you should enjoy as much freedom as you like to be evasive about your vacation plans, your home address, your penis size, your insulin requirements, or whether you prefer jazz or rock, your religion, the last time you had an argument with your parents, or any other thing which is technically none of the patient‚Äôs business. 

It‚Äôs nice to have a human rapport with the people you help, but a human rapport is just that: it‚Äôs not a medical procedure you‚Äôre obliged to provide to meet a proper standard of care. It‚Äôs an optional thing that you can manage within reasonable limits. 

I will say one thing: the point of a wedding ring is to let people know you are happy about having a particular person in your life. The point of that tradition is to let people know one of those personal things about you, just by looking at your hand. That‚Äôs a fine thing to do, and letting people know you‚Äôre happily married is usually assumed to add to your happiness. 

Even if you get some strange reactions, or discover some hold-overs from an earlier era of bigotry, you may find it means more to you to just enjoy the tradition of letting people know. ‚ÄúBeen married to the man of my dreams for 8 years now, thanks for asking‚Äù makes you part of that tradition, is honest, and leaves no real room for argument. You‚Äôll get a bigot once in a while, but you will also get bright smiling eyes of someone who is happy for you when you least expect it. "
I hate how these comments are always upvoted in every relationship post. 
"It‚Äôs wonderful. I was questioning (denying) my sexuality for so long (even after I came out I wasn‚Äôt *sure*) until I finally cuddled with a guy. It felt so fucking right. Cuddling with some hookup was more amazing than any cuddling I‚Äôd ever done with a girl. 

When you‚Äôre laying there it doesn‚Äôt matter that people out in the world hate you, and your parents don‚Äôt truly accept you, and your coworker treats you differently since he found out you‚Äôre gay. Because in that moment of peaceful existence you get to have what you put up with all the bullshit for.

I have internalized homophobia, and it helps me to accept myself. It feels so right. If being with another man makes me feel that way, how could it be wrong?"
"Plot twist: With his muscles sore and achy, OP went to the locker rooms. He took off his sweaty clothes and hopped in the shower. The hot steam engulfed him and water flowed down his muscular body, hitting his neck and broad shoulders and running down his back to drip off his muscled butt, and down his collarbone to his pecs and tight abs, and down his muscled thighs down to his toned, hairy calves. 

OP stepped out of the showers, wrapping his towel around him. He was walking back to his locker when he spotted the guy. The homophobe. The jerk was blocking his way! 

""What do you want?"" OP said.

""Did you really think I was into you, gay boy? That stuff is gross! Did you really think I'd want to get my hands on you?""

""I don't know! Whatever!""

""I'm curious though. I heard that gay guys go crazy over straight guys they can't have. I want to test that. Touch my chest, boy. Entertain me. If you want.""

OP couldn't hide his inner excitement. He put his strong hands on the guy's shoulders and slowly dragged his fingers down to feel the fabric of the guy's gym shirt, tightened out by the guy's firm pecs. OP trailed his fingers to the guy's nipples. 

""Fuck..."" the guy sighed. ""Gay guys really do go crazy for straight guys. I gotta say you've got an amazing body, OP. Fuck, what am I saying...""

""Just to let you know. I can please you like no girl can."" OP said with a mischievous wink.

The guy looked like he was in a daze. His bulge showed through his black basketball shorts. ""Looks like your cock could use some attention,"" OP said, dragging his fingers across the guy's chest, causing the guy's growing dick to twitch and stiffen.

The guy snapped out of it. ""No, no I can't.""

""Your lips say no but your dick says yes,"" OP countered.

""God damn,"" the guy stammered as drops of wetness pooled around the bulge in his black basketball shorts.

""Come on, OP. Show me what you've got.""

"Forget your family until they can accept you.  My Mom told me I was going to Hell until the day she died.  I don't believe in Hell.  My Dad actually did accept that I was gay but he was almost 80 by then.  Do you have that long to wait?

You surround yourself with people who love you, accept you, believe in you, as you are.  You separate yourself from those who doubt, only criticize, only question your choices.  You cannot live a good life surrounded by toxic people.  

And maybe when they have a choice of a gay you or no you they will decide a gay you is better.  I separated myself from my family for 8 years and surrounded myself with my Family of Choice.  In this positive environment I became strong, I blossomed, I allowed my authentic self to be free.  

Nobody is happy pretending to be someone that they are not.  Do you not think the woman they foist upon you won't notice that you cringe when she touches you?  It is not only unfair to you it is really unfair to her as well.

Be you, let your family decide if they want you or some pretend, unhappy guy. "

The rest of the people on this thread are just as stupid for ignoring and beating around the bush in regard to that basic fact.  Are you addicted to pain and rejection? Gtfo of this dude.

"I did a lot of threesomes with a couple of tops, so yea they did take *good* care of me. At first I was afraid of them being inconsiderate or rough (them using me as a fleshlight) but they weren't, they still kissed me and did other affectionate stuff (they were romantic fuckers), in general I didnt feel any different, they were passionate with me just as they were with each other,I even got to cuddle with them being sandwiched lol. It was nice. "
"There are a few explanations for this:

For me, it can get repetitive and boring. You have the same conversation with a bunch of different people and its hard to feel a real connection. 

Sometimes you read the message and forget to respond, but then you go back after a day or so and are kind of just like, ""ehhh"".

From my experience, the guys that I was kind of on the fence about almost always want to message. I mean, you're not unattractive, I swiped right, but you're also not that exciting.

Ultimately tinder's main failing is that it is too easy to keep swiping for something better. This paired with the lack of real-life connectivity makes you lose interest pretty quickly. Your standards on tinder are a lot higher than they would be if you were meeting guys in the flesh."

"On the other hand, I commend the OP for doing what he thinks is best for his patient, even if it compromises his values a bit. 

To be clear, I am NOT saying he has to lie. But I think it is perfectly morally acceptable to prioritize your patients' comfort levels over your own ""honesty,"" especially in acute/trauma situations. If you're managing long term care and think your patient can easily find a different doctor if they need to--I think it's easier to come out. "

"OP - this is extremely distressing. Another commenter mentioned confronting the boyfriend. This is a good idea for two reasons: (1) Scare him about being involved with your son, (2) learn who he is in case he tries to steal your son from you. 

It sounds like you are in an extremely difficult position and I wish I had better advice, if the local police aren‚Äôt helpful then you are truly in a weak position."
"You did something horrible and bad. Mostly to yourself.

You don't want an open relationship. You knew he would cheat on you eventually, so you decided to play yourself into believing that you're compeletly okay with it. You're NOT okay with it. You deserve to expect exclusiveness, you're worth it.

In my opinion, you should revert your decision and tell him you don't want to share. Instead of assuming the worse, give him the opportunity to prove his loyality -- something that you took from him at the beginning, changing him into a bad guy. 

If he will actually cheat on you then, you should find someone worth your time or stay alone. Have some self respect, friend."

For some reason I am totally turned off by anyone who is not interested in me. Like it literally turns me off if I find out for whatever reason you're not feeling me.  Not to be a hater, but I generally find that guys who are considered ""extremely hot"" are almost always assholes. They develop a complex because of what our society says about people like them, especially in the gay community, they are really edified, so I've grown used to just avoiding the really hot ones, anyway because attitude is also a huge turn off to me. It would be nice if you could be gorgeous and not a douchebag, but that seems increasingly rare!



I think you need to learn how to see people's character and not just how cool or hot they are, then those people will suddenly start to seem less appealing."

"ICU Doctor here. As other people have stated, my obligation to my patients is to provide them the best possible care. An integral part of that is gaining their trust and developing a rapport. Part of that requires being conscious of potential barriers to developing these two things. In certain parts of the country, one of those barriers may be my sexuality. When I worked in Texas, my patients often asked me if I was Christian (I was Catholic at the time, so not the good kind - to them - at least. Anecdotally, one of my hijab-wearing colleagues got referred to as ""Sister"" or ""nun"" despite being corrected numerous times, because this patient couldn't seem to countenance being taken care of by a Muslim woman) or if I ""accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior,"" and they would often ask me to pray with them (I just put me head down and let them do the talking), and that went  a long way to building trust and rapport. When patients ask about my personal life, I know they are trying to do the same thing, but in Texas I would quickly re-direct the conversation back to them or their families, or other more neutral topics like hobbies or sports, etc. Telling them I was gay would do in most, but not all circumstances (it was a major city, after all), quite the opposite. 

The last thing anyone needs to do to a patient or their family in a high-pressure, anxiety-laden environment is to introduce a reason to not trust their doctor. Don't get me wrong - if they are homophobic, are their views uninformed, myopic, lacking in compassion and/or small minded? Yes. But the thing to bear in mind is that they are the ones in a vulnerable position, and you are the one in a position of responsibility to them, not other way around. There are always gonna be the persistent ones, especially the mothers with unmarried daughters, and I have found myself playing along, only saying ""I'm currently not on the market,"" or deflecting with ""trust me, no woman these days wants to marry someone with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and terrible hours (and who likes dick).""

Now on the other hand, in the liberal metropolis in the Mountain West I work in today, this would not be an issue at all. I just spoke with a wonderful gay couple, one of whom was here for a major surgery. I asked how long they had been together (40+ years), and commented that I hoped me and my boyfriend still look as young and in-love as they do when we are their age. Knowing that their doctor was also gay seemed to be of great comfort to them, since I'm sure earlier in their lifetime, an encounter with a physician might involve judgement or prejudice that made them distrust their provider or the care they were providing.

Now the people you work with - specifically, the nurses - are a harder group to navigate. Before I came out I actually dated a few (female), and trust me, there is truth in the words ""Don't shit where you eat."" At my current hospital, the nurses would pry and pry about my personal life, and I initially didn't give an inch. However, one day one of the nurses' brothers brought her coffee at work, she introduced me to him, and that night I ran into him again at a gay bar with my boyfriend. By 0700 the next morning, the day shift was already crowding around asking how long I had been in a relationship.

TL;DR - Just always remember, its about them, not us. Do whatever is best for them in any situation. If there is any remote possibility that your sexuality may be a barrier to the doctor-patient relationship, keep it to yourself, and play along if you need to."
Yes...VERY yes!  Sux that I can‚Äôt find decent porn with real Arab guys. Usually they just take a Latino guy and throw a damn keffiyeh on his head. 
he didn't suck your dick? disappointing.
Yeah that zoomed in shot of dick going in and out does nothing for me. I want to see the expression on the guy's face too.
The most awesome experience in bed... For the first 10 minutes until he falls asleep and kick me aside

"ok. Now I need to know even more.

For the Record: I'm sorry he made you feel that way. But I can only imagine that the transition from that relationship to your current one is Oscar worthy.

I'm not going to date him lol
"I hooked up with this guy a while ago and he told me to stay the night. When we went to sleep I layed my head on his chest and Jesus Christ did it feel good. But it gets better, in the middle of the night one of his dogs made a loud noise and we both kind of woke up. Thing is, I'm scared even of my own shadow so I jumped a little bit when the dog woke me up (while still being dizzy from just waking up). He looked at me and chuckled softly and just asked ""were you asleep?"" and I just said yeah and he just hugged me and I fell asleep like that. I have never felt that safe in my entire life"
OP replied above. The met on non-hookup social media. 
" &gt;&gt;I was going to openly hook up with ~50 guys in the same day

Sad. I wanted to look at this juicy post history lmao 
"Lived in a house with an attic suite, we all shared washrooms on the second level.  My roommate upstairs was straight, and open minded to a point, in that 'its cool but I don't want to see it way.'  We became good friends, shared lots of meals and socialized lots.   

One Sunday morning after a particularly successful night of partying at a gay club I ran into him in the hallway heading to the washroom.  He asked to bum a smoke.  I said sure, just go in my room, they are on my desk.  I knew full well there were two men in my bed sleeping, fully exposed.  Both were recent arrivals from Eritrea, and one was ridiculously gifted in the underpants.  

The look on my roommates face when he came out of my room was priceless.  He couldn't speak, and didn't look me in the eyes for days."
You mean you blocked all the ones showing *the power bottom starter kit* !
to beat them up or kill them
"I was definitely an ""in your face faggot"" but it was the 70's and necessary.  People who complain about in your face gay people probably don't have a single negative thing to say about a straight man and woman pawing each other in public.  And to me in your face heterosexuality is just as if not more annoying as they seem to consider it a right."
"Being exclusively a bottom or top is lame.  How about both of you actually try out taking turns being top - who knows, maybe you'll realize you are actually vers. I think 18/19 is a little young to know for sure that you are only a bottom."

"They exist, and the fact that they pass so well for straight is why the stereotype that gay men are (easily identifiable) effeminate, flamboyant queens perpetuates. 

Girls make a lot of passes at me, gay guys never. When I'm around straight guys, they all seem to assume I'm one of the crew. It's not that I'm particularly butch or an archetypal fratboy. Just... a guy. "

"A young man up the street from my husband and I was obviously, painfully gay. He used to hide in the park across from our house and watch us at home where we would be as affectionate as possible with the windows open. 

His parents were great and thanked us for being role models while we all waited for him to come out. Still waiting, but over Christmas break, he introduced us to who we all think is his first boyfriend. "
"What do you mean by they ""don't want to talk about it?"" Talk about what? Cowboy butt sex? Relationships? Cute guys? Politics? Or your life in general?

I don't talk about being gay with coworkers. I do talk about my husband if the subject comes up. But I don't talk about what we do personally.

Talking about ""gay"" covers a lot of territory. So what is it they don't want to talk about?"
I don't like big. Average to small size is good.

You deserve better than this guy. "
He wants to fuck you.  He *doesn‚Äôt* want to be your boyfriend.
"Damn dude, way to trivialize it. Kissing doesn't lead to sex and getting together to hang out doesn't imply sex either. This is how people meet nowadays- maybe as gay men we need to start being more open about assaults that happen to us so it doesn't continue to happen. It shouldn't be tolerated- go say that to a woman in the same position as this guy, see how the response would be to you there. Why is it ok because its a guy? "

"I am dealing with chronic depression. Just make him feel like he's safe and you're there for the longtime. He may not have the energy to do things, but don't let that be the end of effort. Encourage him to gain experiences in life as best as you can. Give him affirmations as best as you can at reasonable times that seem genuine. The person I use to love had to put up with my depression for years and didn't really know that to do, but I always felt better when he made me feel like everything was going to be okay and he explained how and why. There will be some disappointments on your end, but don't beat him down if it gets frustrating. Let him know he is the man you want, and let him know you'll help him become an even better love."
Ummm no way am I doing that in anything other than a toilet.

"Maybe it can be just the shadows,who knows."
"You need to communicate with him.  If you need space, get space and clear your head.  Tell him that.

If you decide you can't see anything with him, then don't continue because he looks good on paper.  Relationships are emotional - you need to feel a connection and like it is going somewhere.  If you don't, do him a favor and break it off.  It will give him the opportunity to find someone who wants him for who he is."
"&gt;He told me that his life goal is to buy a house with me and live with me, and that true happiness for him would be us chilling at the house with a hot tub and our dogs.

He sounds gay to me, or at least bi. Imagining a future life with another guy isn't normal for a straight guy. Especially when he's at the ""let's buy a house together"" level. 

Honestly, tell him you're gay, he may be thinking the exact same things as you."
There are no laws or rules about this.

I would suck a guy even if he doesnt suck me but man, I would feel like im being used, and as if the guy wasnt into me. Would hate feeling like that. Luckily all my hook ups were pretty good at reciprocating. I call it respect when you're giving what you get."

"That's a very long story, I'm 69.  

I was raised in a small town.  My Dad was 2nd generation Irish Catholic, my mother's family has been here a long time.  My grandma, who actually accepted me, went to Mass everyday.  I have 5 siblings.  

The first time I had sex with a man was in a Catholic seminary where a bus load of us went for the weekend to see if we had a vocation.  Then next time I was 16, he was 28.  He tried to cram his 10"" cock up my ass without getting me ready.  I ran back into the closet screaming.  

I was drafted at 18 into the Army during the Vietnam War.  I was smart and managed to get myself assigned to NATO War HQS in Germany.  Had sex a few times with a German soldier.  I took a European out and published an anti-war newspaper for American GI's.  I probably have a CIA file.  I met a man in Berlin who was Dutch and I moved to Holland to live with him.  He was a concert pianist and lived on a houseboat on the Prinsengracht.  He taught me how to make love to a man.  

I left Holland to go back home and moved to Michigan.  It was 1972, I joined the GLF and the Human Rights Party.  I came out and have been out ever since.  I helped elect first openly gay political candidate.  I helped negotiate the first labor contract with sexual preference protection.  I met my soulmate and we were together 7 years.  We marched, picketed, demonstrated, got beat up not just for gay rights but also for women's rights, economic justice, rent control, African-American civil rights, against the Nazis who came to Ann Arbor every year on Hitler's birthday. 

I met my 2nd partner and started taking care of me.  Instead of demonstrating I produced theater shows.  We lasted 9 years.  In 1992 I moved to Texas to live with my 3rd partner.  We met in Michigan but his job moved to Texas.  I went screaming and kicking because Texas.......  We were together 17 years.

I've had a good life and eventually I reconciled with my family.  My mother, to the day she died, insisted I was going to hell.  That's her right to believe in her myths but I can't live my life based on somebody else's beliefs.  Today I speak with all of my sisters weekly.  My brothers not so much but my youngest brother is even more introverted than I am.  

Had I listened to my mother I would not have had 33 years being with a partner.  I wouldn't have been a gay activist.  I might be an unhappy grandfather or worse, great-grandfather.  I'm single now and in no hurry to find partner #4.  I have a lovely home, a beautiful garden, 75 books waiting to be read and true friends who have been with me for 45 years.  

I don't regret cutting off my family.  It made me strong, independent and much more important true to myself.  You can only live your own truth.  Trying to live someone else's truth will make you miserable."
This is shitty.

"I quit loaning money decades ago.  I will GIVE people money if they need it, and if they choose to give it back, that's fine.  But, I don't do loans.

"First, take a deep breath and read this next sentence very carefully. You are gay and there's nothing wrong with that. 

Got it? It's very important you understand that concept before anyone can do anything to help you. You have accept who you are and what that means as you try to build a life for yourself. 

One more time, for those in the back. **You are gay and there's nothing wrong with that.**

Now, speaking as someone who grew up in a household where homosexuality was seen as a sin, I can see where you're coming from. Realizing that you're a part of the community that everyone you know critizes simply because it exists is hard. There are things ingrained in your mind that you probably won't be completely over for years to come. There's nothing wrong with that, either. You're a teenager; everything you know has been provided for you by other people for your entire life, including the internalized homophobia you mentioned. 

I, for one, couldn't admit that I was gay until I was almost in my senior year of high school. I supported gay rights before then. I even joined the Gay-Straight Alliance for the one year it was allowed to exist, but I hated being around those who were out of the closet at my school, and at the time I reasoned that it was because they were *too* gay. That wasn't it at all; I just couldn't accept that I was who I am. It was too much to handle knowing that my life would never be the way I pictured it growing up. 

But, I worried myself and hid who I was for nothing. I missed out on *years* of personal growth because I was too busy tearing myself down. Don't be like me. Don't waste your high school years trying to hide or change who you really are. It will get you nothing but regret in the coming years as you begin to realize that being gay doesn't mean you can't have a good life. 

Take it from someone who was in your shoes: your life is going to turn out fine. You won't be alone forever. You won't always feel like you don't have any real friends. You won't miss out on having kids. The only way any of that will happen is if you never accept yourself. After all, how can anyone else even begin to accept you of you can't even give that courtesy to yourself?

"In my late teens my mindset was the old ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay but it doesn‚Äôt define me‚Äù taken to the extreme where I felt I couldn‚Äôt identify with any other gay people. 

I picked up Stephen Fry‚Äôs first autobiography *Moab is My Washpot* and at first it seemed to confirm how I felt. The world of English private boarding schools in the 60s and 70s is completely alien to me - being gay is just about the only thing I have in common with Stephen Fry. But the way he describes his first love cut right through me. It was such a strange experience to see a part of myself I hadn‚Äôt shown to anyone laid out on the pages of a book that thousands of people had read.

It helped me accept that gay people do have a common history and shared experiences, and that embracing that affinity doesn‚Äôt mean giving up your individuality."

"I get hit on by a lot of confused or experimenting ""straight"" guys because I'm ftm transgender so they think it's a perfect compromise.

So I've learned not to fuck with the straight dudes."
