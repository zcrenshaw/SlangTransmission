Can't *imagine* why her blood pressure is so high.
"""Manager friend: Oh damn. Yeah, you're screwed.""

Welp, you have been Spoken To. Bitch should be satisfied now."
"Omg stay safe! 
I once had a customer tell my coworker that we were horrible for closing early on a holiday because she needed to leave her family to get her shopping done before we closed. A coworker responded that thank god we're a bunch of robots with no family of our own. 

Ah the good old days 15 years ago when we could snark right back..."
"You smoke and text, what's next??

Eating? Sleeping?"
On behalf of women in management every where. Thank you 
"This is the most heartwarming story I've read on here. As a clumsy college student, I can relate."
That was really sweet of you to do. I think it was nice that she got a reward for being honest and not making a scene yelling at you or blaming you for what happened. And the brownies were a nice thank you! 
"Your coworker totally sucks. God damn, I'm pretty even keeled at work, but I would have lost it if she had given out my information to people threatening me."
"I give you props for telling her off about being on her phone. If they get mad at me when they're on their phone, I'm super calm and imply about it, but I respect that you went off(: I need a backbone like you!"
Worse: clocking out every day. EVERY SINGLE ONE.
"She'll probably always remember your kindness. 

It was over twenty years ago that I waited patiently in line at the Registry of Motor Vehicles to register a car for my husband. I'd done lots of transactions at this office. Got up to the desk, and the lady said ""Your husband forgot to sign this line. Here's a pen- bring the form out to the car and have him sign it. I'll call you up to the front of the line when you get back.""
That woman made my day. More like two days, because I would've had to come back another day to complete the transaction.  
"
Petty as fuck. I love it
"at age 18 i got a job doing 911 dispatch. i was the only male and the youngest dispatcher by a good 15 years. whenever the women had a really difficult caller, they'd put them on hold and tell me to pick up, which almost always made the caller chill out, start calling me ""sir"", and sometimes even assume the dispatcher had transferred them to a cop already.

but really i was a dumb 18 year old with a baritone voice, and i was still learning the ropes so whatever they wanted usually ended up taking twice as long. that's what you get for being dumb."
Tooooooold!  Glad he took it well. Haha
"I once had a customer actually argue that the item was free because it didn't scan... For twenty God damn minutes. The shorts were twenty bucks and she argued that since I had to go get the code it meant it was free because her pair ""obviously"" had a different code (I really didn't get her logic since the shorts were the exact same, size and all).

After about twenty minutes of her yelling at me I deleted the item off the pos and put the shorts behind the counter. She asked what I was doing and I said, ""Since it didn't scan properly I've had to faulty to item so upper management knows that there was an issue with scanning the shorts."" She was stunned, but left with the shorts after she paid for them in the end (after another ten minutes of spluttering). This was the highlight of my first Christmas in retail. "
All that SALT
"You should've told him, ""Yes, I don't understand idiots."""
Hi I singed this contract and I didn't read it.  The guy tried to explain it but I was on the phone.  You totally are not going to hold me to that are you?
"My ex had her PHD so her credit cards all had Dr on them. When we went out for dinner and it was her turn to pay she'd hand over a card, but they'd see that Dr title and try to give it back to me to sign or enter a PIN. What made it even funnier was that she is asian. Her cards read Dr Tang, and every time they would read that, look between the Chinese girl (who had handed over the card in the first place) and the white guy and hand it to the white guy. "
"Seriously. One if the guys working for me is 39 (I'm 23), and I've had multiple people turn to him about a complaint or something, but he just smiles and tells them I'm his superior. Always satisfying. "
Can you go check in the back for more gas? 
"I have worked retail for 10+ years and i hate when customers say that when certain items don't ring up. No it's not free mf

Edit: spelling"
I took a lot of pride in that job and always went above and beyond for customers. It was that she lied and basically accused me of being lazy in front of my immediate supervisor. Like GIRL I AM NOT THE CASHIER TO START ON 
In my state they also scan your license and you can't buy more than a certain amount in a certain time period from any one store. I bet she's gotten around it by sending kids in after she's hit the limit. 
"Jeez just reading that made me think of when we closed early on Easter. There was one lady in bakery who had to tell customers we were closed and they would have to come back tomorrow, and after being outside for 30 seconds I already felt bad for her. One guy walked up to the door and she told him we were closed, then he says ""well why couldn't you tell me that when I got out my truck instead of making me walk up here?"" So she yells to the next guy as he gets out his truck that we're closed, then he says ""well you don't have to yell at me."" "
"He took it on the chin. When I called him as a courtesy call after delivery he joked saying ""I should've used the inflation trick on the delivery driver"" as we use a contractor for delivery i.e. delivery charge. So I think he felt embarrassed upon afterthought."
"I bet it's mutually beneficial. You have authority, and he has the ability to direct annoying people to that authority and away from him. Glorious example of symbiosis in action."
"I was so pissed, but she was untouchable because her bf was the AM. The GM was also his mum, so I didn't have a leg to stand on. A large part of the reason I left the job which I otherwise enjoyed. "
"As you can guess, this definitely happened all over Houston as well. But in my area, not as severe. I work at a sporting goods store that was in a voluntary evacuation area but right next to a mandatory evacuation area. Of course, due to employees living all over the place, we couldn't operate at one hundred percent, But when possible we opened our doors to first responders, volunteers and those with the intention of donating only. Our managers were basically bouncers asking people what they need to determine if letting them in was valid. Lots of people lied. And lots were pissed because there weren't enough employees. No, you can't get a treadmill in the middle of a storm. No, you can't buy a bike for your daughter. One guy was legit just wanting to kill time. One drove out to us just to buy a headband. It felt very... Frustrating and heartbreaking. To see first responders, police, swat, and regular people with trucks and boats walk in sleep deprived with a true intention of helping and saving others. You could see they were running on little to no sleep. And then you get families who treated it as a regular day pissed off that parts of the store were off limits because there was no one to maintain the department when they lied to get in. 

On the news, they specifically said do not drive out on the streets. We had strict curfew due to looters. Many news channels brought to attention that they realize people disregard their warning because it could risk losing a job. Yet you want to buy a bike..where are you going to ride it?!


I've had a taste of your experience and I'm so sorry. People suck. Retail teaches you to hate. But what matters is your safety and your family's safety. Do what you gotta do. For some, it is a fight to the death. And sorry for the rant. Its been on my mind a while.."
"I have to do this at work sometimes. I've been in IT for 5 years and at my current company for 1.5 years. 

I have some customers that will not listen to what I'm telling them, even if what I'm saying is coming from documentation or a senior technician. So I just have to grab a male, any male (doesn't matter experience) to repeat what I just said and magically the customer understands and is fine with the answer."
What the actual fuck
"Are you really telling me that customers often fail to read anything other than the coupon's main print? I don't believe it! In all seriousness, though, I am mildly convinced that people forget how to read whenever they walk into a store."
"&gt; I said, ""Lady, she's my boss""

&gt; She goes ""I don't have time for this. Read my vitals and deal with her after"". 

I love that her answer doesn't even match what you said, at all.

Like instead of ""Lady, she's my boss"", she heard ""I'm sorry for her incompetence, she is a new employee that we are still training.""

Some people are just in a different world."
Why are customers taking bags off to get gas? Do they think yall are holding out for yourselves or something?
Time where they're not working? Now this is unacceptable. 
It could have been worse. The kid could have been there with the mom. 
"It's odd but because of customers like this. My usual interaction are like this:

&gt;C: Do you have xyz?

&gt;Me: hmm xyz? I'm not sure. Hold on a sec, let me check. (Even though I know we don't have it)

Browse reddit for a few seconds

&gt;Me: Sorry, it shows we're currently out of stock.

&gt;C: Thanks, the other guy didn't even bother to check."
"With the large bills, pulling out my counterfeit pen, ""Doncha trust me?"" No I don't fucking trust you, I don't even *know* you."
Alternative medical facts. 
"That, or when they hand you a large bill;

*""I just printed it hurr hurr hurr.""*"
Snark away anyways. Fuck rude customers. And fuck managers that won't have your back.
"We need a ""The Purge"" where we can say whatever we want to rude customers and bosses. "
"Oh hell yes, my go to has always been ""... actually, it means we can't legally sell it."" Turns out people *will* wait 7 seconds for me to do a manual search if it means they don't get their doritos."
"And by the sound of it, she's not married either. "
"Eating (swallowing) goldfish was an actual thing in th 50's. Why?  Just googeled -late 1939. ""Goldfish Gulping"" as to why????"
"""Who the fck do you think you are?"" The one who will get in trouble if you damage anything. 

You definitely made the right choice, OP. No one should be touching a worker's equipment, doesn't matter what it is. Hell, I don't even touch equipment that my coworkers have signed out unless they tell me to. "
We have that. It's called the day I put my two weeks in. 
"I don't blame you, I've never walked on a job, but if I don't feel safe, there's no point in being there. It's not worth dying over. Unless I'm an astronaut."
Who the hell approved having vitamins as a free sample? That was just begging for this sort of thing to happen.
Also *little girl*? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IF I CALLED YOU OLD HAG?
"So as you know, it's very disconcerting to be browsing Reddit and suddenly have 'GET OFF YOUR PHONE' appear in the feed."
"So I called the duty Manager over.  Having heard the lady out he picked up the detector pen, turned to Coworker and said ""So here we have a great learning opportunity, watch while I demonstrate all of the various techniques to confirm these bill are genuine""

Is how I was hoping that would end."
"That was handled very well. I gotta admit, I probably would have just kicked him out. I have no patience for rude people "
"&gt;Angry Customer, suddenly screaming: I SAW YOU! KISSING THAT BOY! WHILE AT WORK! YOU ARE NOT EVEN MARRIED! (She must have assumed this, as she had not had time to see if I was actually wearing a ring)

Correct Response:  ""Oh, no, that was my brother.  My wife will be here in about a half hour so I can carry her to the abortion clinic."""
"God, if you did have signs, they wouldn't be big enough or in enough places. You can't win, especially when it comes to common sense!"
"I am old enough to remember when stores first introduced bar code scanning. At the time some customers were very suspicious of this new fangled technology. In order to build customer confidence a lot of stores advertised that ""If the scanner makes a price error then you get that product for free.""  I know this isn't quite the same as ""If it doesn't scan its free"" but I suspect that a long abiding memory of that policy is the root cause of the joke. "
Is the lesson learned here to be honest or to say that the screen was cracked when she took it out of the box? :)
