He's not your friend.
My sister worked for an Amazon facility (in the USA) in the returns department. She has to take a water pill which increases urination. She brought a note from the doctor backing this up. She was fired shortly after because she was using the bathroom too much and she wasn't making 100% of her production.

Are you my wife
You and that person that finished their pen should get married and create a super human
Ok
I don't think Melania is on Reddit 
I got a pizza once so wasn't all lost profits haha
"Fine, i won't ask a fucking question. Have a nice day."
"Day 75: The few of us that made it to the fallout shelters are coming to grips with the taste of MRE's. We're still learning the extent of the damage of the nuclear exchange with Russia. Even worse, we're learning that the Cult of Moloch has shed their human suits and are kidnapping our remaining children for High Priestess Clinton to sacrifice. The only hope we're clinging to is the insane rumors that Putin has been training bears that eat lizard people as war mounts. I pray they are real and get here before the army of ZuccTerminators find us."
"I was a believer until age 20. When I was 20 I made a muslim friend who was one of the kindest people Ive ever known. Selfless, loving, forgiving, humble and hardworking. I couldnt beleive in a God who wouldnt have mercy on her and send her to hell. So I got ""saved"" by a muslim lol thats when i became an athiest"
Did you just eat it? My dog does that...it doesn't count.

"Worked for Amazon distribution. Never pissed in a bottle. But worked 12 hour shifts. If you stopped scanning items for more than 10 seconds it would start counting “time off task” so every bathroom trip would result in 5 minutes off task as the bathrooms are far away. You get 20 minutes of time off task a day. Pissing took 5 minutes. If you had to do the other, make it 10+. I hate that place. "
Twitter isn’t nearly as exciting.
"I've played over 300 video games to completion, so we're basically in the same boat."
ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY WOULD NOT TRY IT!
"Made a throw away just in case. Not sure if this is what you’re looking for but my first husband died young. (We we’re both 30 when he died) I never wanted to remarry. He was my soulmate...I believe in heaven, when I die I want to see my first husband. I don’t want to confuse God and die and have him give me two husbands in the afterlife. I just want one. Mine. My first. The love of my life. 

Met a super wealthy man (also in his 30’s...old money) who was looking for a skinny, pretty girl to take to events. Here we are. Married. I get money. And travel and anything my heart desires. He gets a pretty woman who is educated to have on his arm and I’m happy to play the part. I still work...he supports my dreams (financially and emotionally) he’s actually really proud of the current project I’m working on. So it’s not like a “here’s money. See you later.” We actually have a relationship. 

I love him a lot. Not in love. He’s sweet. Kind. I would do anything for him. But he’s fully aware that my heart is with my first husband and I’m fully aware that he loves me too but probably not in the traditional marriage sense. 

Not sure if this is what you meant in asking this question but thought I’d respond either way! 

Edit: please don’t judge me. I’ll bounce my ass right out of here if that’s the case. I’ve already heard every insult in the world. Not here to be shit on. My first husband dying wasn’t in my plan. I’m doing the best I can. 

Edit 2: you can ask me anything. I promise to be honest. "
"Kid, do you mean the Counter-Strike game?  Last time I played it was 2003 maybe, I don't remember exactly.

"&gt; but just because he sells me heroin doesn't make him a bad person

I would respond with...Heroin ruins lives so people that sell it are bad people in that they prey upon other people with no regard to their well being.

I would also say that you are not the best judge of the situation because...you are addicted to heroin.

I wish you the best of luck in getting clean.

Thank you.
"I never thought I would hook up with a bloke because I’ve always thought of myself as heterosexual. But in the heat of the moment I hooked up with a dude. And liked it. But at every other point in my life I’ve never felt any sexual inclination towards a dude. So that was very different and for awhile I questioned whether that interaction makes me bi. But now I’ve come to the conclusion that sexuality isn’t as black and white as people make it out to be. Most people don’t fit into neat little boxes, especially when they do things outside the box.

Also you sound like a really nice guy and you shouldn't ever sleep with someone just for a shag if it isn't who you are. There's nothing wrong with only being able to sleep with people who you are wanting to be emotionally invested in. It's a great trait to have in a guy.

"I saw a person who could walk sit down in a wheelchair. Go into a room where they didnt know anyone. Recieve prayer for healing to walk, rise out of thewheel chair and proclaim they were healed. This stuff happened allcthe time. Sometimes with the intent to manipulate. Sometimes, in a situation like this, the person truely had trouble walking, and used a wheelchair for assistance, but could walk/stand. Then when they would stand, people would think they saw a miracle and the person who was ""healed"" was so afraid to deny Gods power, they didnt say anything"

"OKAY so I only just realised a year ago that it isn’t normal to identify places/people/locations with a colour. After a bit of googling with a friend, I finally found out that I was on the spectrum of synesthesia. Although mine isn’t as crazy as some stories I have heard. I more just identify people and locations with a colour, and the alphabet + names have colours too. Like Tuesday is blue, March is orange etc. It’s kind of cool! When and how did you realise that you had this special ability?"

"Just come across confident, don't be clingy and be honest and fun. Instead of saying things like hey, how are you, I try something funny and original, you're way more likely to get a response if you stand out in comparison to all the other messages they get. I just try and be myself, I'm not a serious person, I like to laugh and make others laugh, I'm also very confident in myself  (Not in a stuck up way) and I don't let others bring me down, i go into things thinking it's their loss if they don't respond instead of sitting around wondering why they don't respond"
&lt;3 You get me.
"I'm currently grieving because I was just informed that my ex wife committed suicide, we have a 6 year old daughter... 

I didn't know how I was going to approach her with this subject. But you have given light out of the darkness. You are a blessing to people's lives whom you've never met, you have touched me. I am so so so eternally sorry for your loss, you were just a child and no one can say anything to make it better. 

We also have more questions than answers. But I am not giving up, because I knew that my daughter would have questions, and you have confirmed all of my concerns. I want to pour my love into my daughter, but I know it will require a lot more. Can you offer any advice to me? When should I tell her the truth, at what age? I don't want to traumatize her.

I'm heartbroken and at a loss for words. "
How many people? 
I came from a family of prophets. They called ua the roving band of prophets. We would go from church to church and we were known for our gifts. I have always had a ton of empathy and creativity. I was trained to prophesy from a young age ( very much like fortune telling) so I could get a decent read on individuals and groups and could prophesy on the spot

"When I was eight years old, I was a latchkey kid.  This means that when I came home from school each day, my parents weren't there yet and I had to use a key to let myself in. I would always pull the key right out of my pocket and try it in the lock without checking to see if it was right way up or not. 

Instead of getting it right 50% of the time like you would expect, I would get it right 52% of the time. So, yes, I always knew that I was better than most. "

"I've thought about it a lot, for sure. It's a massive risk, though, turning something you do for fun into a job. Maybe it works out and you get that ""never work a day in your life"" feeling. On the other hand, you could ruin something you used to enjoy. I'm just not ready to take that leap. "
"That’s a very good question, her death was “hidden” from me until I was 18. When I was very young my father told me that mommy was driving around, she pulled over, and went to sleep, never waking up. As I grew up I asked my father how she really died and he told me to wait until I got older. But, I over heard him talking about it when I was 12. I didn’t say anything because he didn’t want me to know. When my dad told me at 18, I told him that I’ve always known and we cried. "

The sensations of hands on my body. Of sweat trickling down my back. Of so many people touching me with various parts of their body that my senses were overwhelmed.

"Personally I think so but if they are happy then I guess they aren't. Sex is different for everyone, some people are fully satisfied with 1 sexual partner and I think that's great, people should just do what makes them happy, I did and I don't regret it at all. 

It varies alot, some are slow, fast, good, rough, bad, some you never orgasm some you leave there bed a big puddle. 

Best would be when I had 3some with 2 incredibly hot brothers and they were both really well sized and knew what they were doing. The brother factor defintely made it better too.

 Worst sex would be with a guy who talked a big game but had no idea what he was doing, he licked the crease between my vag and thigh instead of my clit and then he had no rhythm and came in 5 seconds flat. "

"Hey dont be sorry, I got myself into this mess, not you....Well I started using pills (painkillers) back when I was in high school at the age of 17. A close friend of mine gave me a STRONG painkiller at a party and I loved the high....after that I started having my friend get me more painkillers and then he got into heroin and he stopped using pills so then I tried getting pills from him one day and he tried finding some and couldn't, but told me he could get heroin instead.....at first I was reluctant to try it because I thought that pain killers were ""so much safer"" than heroin....so after a few hours of not being able to find any pills, I said fuck it and had him get me heroin and it was SO much cheaper and I got the same effect basically....and that's how I got into heroin. I didn't get really into it until my parents house burned down while I was living with them at the time. After the fire I got really depressed and started using heroin everyday. 
   I have done just about every well known drug out there.....acid, meth, cocaine, ecstasy, Molly, magic mushrooms, you name it and I've probably dabbled in it. I currently use heroin everyday still and ive been smoking meth on and off for awhile as well. Usually every time I go get a bag of heroin? My dealer has meth loaded up into his pipe and I'll take a few hits before leaving. So yes I've been using an amphetamine (meth) for around 3 or 4 years now. Usually about once or twice a week though and thats it. Sometimes ill go on a binder and buy some meth too and ill get spun out for 5 or 6 days."
