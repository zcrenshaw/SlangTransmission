"It's clearly a ""duh, he's married"" situation"
Sorry to say this but she might just really like the necklace. 
"It is just speculation but I wouldn't be surprised if she found out he put a hole in the condom, especially after reading he tries to push for sex without condoms. OP, sounds like he wants to force you to be tied down with him either through financial means or possibly with this baby! Please leave him, none of this is healthy at all."
"Look at it this way: even if she never attacks YOU again, what if she attacks someone else? Someone she legitimately thinks is a weaker victim than you turned out to be?

If she has this on her record, either she might stop actually assaulting people because oh hey, consequences, OR if she does go after someone else, there's established prior behavior so that her next victim can get legal recompense - and THEN the behavior might be stopped for her, because of the escalating nature of the legal consequences and ramifications."
Thank you. I agree with what you've said. 
"And for the love of god, OP, do not tell him you're going if you decide to have an abortion. He is the kind of guy who would lock you in the house to keep you from doing this."
"He keeps saying that ""she wouldnt like the trips"" well buddy how the fuck do you know if you never invited her?

"
"It really depends on the context, right? I mean i could see a group of friends hanging out and you cant resist messing up Bob’s perfectly styled hair because that’s what buds do, sure.  But if you’re alone with a dude watching Netflix on a couch, playing wih his hair isn’t just a platonic gesture anymore.   "
"Seriously. This was hard to read. It seems obvious that she's most likely doing drugs with her ""ex"" and completely using OP.

"I just came to that conclusion commenting on another response }: 

thank you for reaffirming"
A UTI from sex is usually caused by bacteria getting pushed into the urethra by all the rubbing. It can come from the woman's skin near her urethra or the penis. Usually showering would take care of this as an issue.
"Or he could just be a bit more gentle and recognize his wife as a person in pain and adjust accordingly.  If he refuses, that ought to be a dealbreaker for her, not him."
You need to stop having sex with him immediately and get into some sort of counseling together. 
"Completely agreed. Definitely mention that you know him, but she really doesn't need her heart broken again over something that nobody can change."
"She hasn't really EARNED your help, has she?

I hereby absolve you of your responsability and cleanse you of any guilt. The hell with her."
Why should she stop going out with her coworkers because boss is being inappropriate?
"&gt;The term **""whoring out our daughter""** was used or at least implied.  


&amp;nbsp;  
WTF? How are so many comments glossing over this? Imagine if your wife had let your daughter go on a date while you weren't there, and then when you find out, you accuse your wife of whoring out your daughter. Words like ""controlling""/""abusive"" would probably be in every third comment.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I think your wife has some deep-seated issues."
"I completely agree with this. To be honest all the parents in this situation sound incredible immature and the children in this family are paying the price. 

Only two people haven't done anything wrong that's OP and the 9 year old. OP your feelings of resentment towards the 9 year old are understandable but also misdirected. I would urge you to work through things in therapy and get the tools you need to deal with your mental trauma. In regards to the 9 year old people that young aren't mature enough to deal with OR understand  the complex emotional issues of adults. Personally I would lie and say my video on my phone isn't working."
"I'd want to know if my husband was fucking someone else right after we'd had a baby no matter how long ago it was, especially if that person was still in our lives. I would want to get the chance to leave someone who would do something so cold to his own wife, rather than be unwittingly with a cheater for the rest of my life. It's not like they tripped and fell on each other, they had sex several times and lied for 27 years."
Though coke wouldn't behave like this.
"You aren't friendzoned. She doesn't want to date you.

You don't have to stay friends, but don't put this on her.."

"Honestly, it sounds what you're describing is dysphoria. However, to have dysphoria you don't have to be be transgender or want to have other parts to replace the ones you don't want or relate to. Things like body dysmorphia disorder (related to OCD, and you can read up on it iocdf.org's website) can cause similar feelings, and there are other disorders, mental illnesses, or just plain personal baggage that may make you feel this way. Obviously, none of us can diagnose you, but I can tell you I have felt exactly the way you felt for much of my life, which is one of the reasons I got a major breast reduction a few weeks ago!

I'm extremely sorry your therapists haven't been helpful. It's almost ironic, since transgender people usually have so many problems finding therapists that are trans-friendly.

Anyway, I would suggest giving it one more go, and seeing if you can find a consultation with a therapist that specialized in OCD and body dysmorphia cases.

But if you don't want to do that, I understand. Just know you're not alone in this!!! Honestly, there are 8 billion humans on this planet, so it comes as no surprise that some of us are just different and somewhat inexplicable. It doesn't have to be a bad thing! : )"
"Comfort in, dump out. Good advice."
"I’m from a big family. Oldest brother dotes on my littlest sister similarly. The age gap means he basically acted as an extra dad for her at times - made sure nobody picked on her and so on. They are very affectionate the same way. Kisses on the cheeks, hugs, and so on. About a four year age gap. Pretty common from my understanding. "
Make yourself a drop box or something with a secure password for backing up pictures. 
"Shit, then I’ve really betrayed my husband. I saw my obgyn last month and he saw both my vag AND my boobs. "
I agree. There's literally no reason to be transfering her that money. Tell her to get a job put that money towards a lawyer and then hit her with divorce papers. She needs to realize that the bad you put out to the world(mooching and looking down upon the person you're suppose to love and appreciate) comes back to you 10x worse. It doesn't take much to be a good person. 
"I'm not sure what kind of advice you're looking for. You rushed into an engagement with a narcissistic meth addict despite issues from the very beginning of the relationship.

You should get some therapy and figure out why you went into this relationship despite every reason not to."
"Its like a stereotype for this sub by now, a record on loop."
"Yeah, my mom is a special needs nurse, has met my friends kid several times and seen what she does and how she acts and even thought she may have Opposition defiance disorder (i think that's the term she used). But, I didn't bring it up because I didn't want the reaction from her I knew would ensue.

only reason I mention it to her and finally just said I felt disrespected was the fact that I had brought it up many times and there was no action from her. Then I finally reached the point of just being irritated. I only said it because if my child was being that disrespectful - no matter their age - or someone told them to not do something and they still did it I would want to know so I could correct it. I guess I was wrong in assuming she would want to know the same."
I’m sure there was a dipstick somewhere in all that smut!
"Thank you, I really did need this comment. I think what sucks the most about losing her is that out of my three friends she is the only one with a child. Especially the only one with a deadbeat dad for her child - similar to my situation. So we were able to give each other support in those aspects like no one else could. 

My other two friends are country like me, but one is decidedly childfree (which is totally cool, her lifestyle is freakin amazing...like she does things that I could never do with out immense planning with a child) and the other is a married couple that have fertility issues (so I don't feel comfortable rubbing my child in her face though her and her hubby love my kiddo with all their hearts, I still don't feel like speaking about the sometimes not so great aspects of having a kid. It's not fair to her). So she really was my only mommy friend."
"Same here, went on one date with a 17-year-old when I was 21, and was like ""this person seems like a child""."
"SHE was keeping it a secret? And what about you, did you make sure before going onto gonewild to send her a text saying ""Hey sweetie, I know that you're unfulfilled sexually, but I don't have time. I'm about to go get on gonewild to go check out others!"" Stop being a hypocrite. The grass is greener where you water it. You need to cut yourself off from online subreddits, websites, etc. Go cold turkey, get proper rest, and pay attention to your girlfriend. OR break up with her if you aren't willing to meet her needs. Neglecting her and checking out of the relationship is NOT a solution."
We have no way of knowing if her mother was honest or not. The brutal fallout suggests she probably was not. 
"Spa=professional. This was like getting her hair cut by a guy. He's totally overreacting.

(And yes, I know there are some sleazy brothels that call themselves ""spa,"" but I've never known a woman to go to one of those for a ""day of pampering."")"
"This is good advice, OP. Your mom is definitely unreasonable (and totally wrong), but you’ll probably have to learn to restrict your social media activities before your friends do. The older you get, the more social media will impact significant stuff (jobs, relationships/friendships, school). Something really innocuous can still bite you in the butt. Keep things private (or seriously limit visibility) unless you’re truly okay with literally anyone in the world seeing it, including your mom. That being said, I’m sorry this is happening to you. It’s unfair and no doubt hard to live with. Four years may seem like forever, but you will be out from under your mom’s roof and control soon, and you’ll have decades to enjoy your independence. In the meantime, keep venting to your friends, keep a sense of humor, and try to keep your focus on the future. 

Also, your video sounds absolutely hilarious!"
"The key words being

“you feel this way” and “I suppose”.

Those are conditional statements.

Personally I would have just let it slide.

It’s her wedding, let her be bridezilla, and leave the topic alone.

Be happy for her, don’t take things personally, and move on with life."
"You need to stop being nice. Id honestly send him a message saying ""I find your texts rude and disgusting, and no longer want to have any contact with you. Do not acknowledge me, do not say hi, and any contact from here on out I will consider harrasment and will be reporting you to the police and the management. "" After that block his number, and as a precatution I would call the local police, explain the situation, ask them to do a courtesy stop and remind him you no longer want contact. Ask for a copy of them saying they came by with their badge number and stuff so you create a trail just incase. Save the messages on your hard drive, and block him on your phone completely. Lock down your social media, and make sure you don't have anything public online. Id even change your photo and name on stuff so he can't find you. From then on pretend he doesn't exist. Make sure your place is locked, make sure you are very aware coming home that he isnt lurking, and buy some pepper spray to keep on you just incase. Id even walk with it in your hand so he can see to not even try to attempt shit. 

It doesn't matter if you see him. You are in charge of your own life, and your friendship was a privilege. He is an old creepy fuck, and he lost it. Too bad, so sad, actions have consequences.

And BTW some old creep old man tried this shit with me. Played friends, and then sent me bible versus, before his 70 year old geezer ass had the audacity to be a perv. Luckily he's on my street, but doesn't know my address, so I didn't call the police. But I called him disgusting, blocked his ass, and completely ignore him every interaction. You don't owe anyone anything."
Uhh yeah. He doesn't really see anything wrong with what the friend did and he's placing some of the blame on the child... This would be a deal breaker to me honestly.

"Break up with your girlfriend, she doesn't deserve to be treated this way, no matter what happened earlier in your relationship. Then do whatever you want."
"I don’t think that him having the porn site account is the worst thing here. It’s kind of skeezy and gross, but wouldn’t be a game ender for me - the fact that he is 10 years older than you, seems to be controlling, doesn’t have a job, and lost his shit and threatened to break up with you for using snapchat however (incredibly childish behaviour that I would expect from a 17 year old) is worrying. 

Reassess how good this guy really is. His behaviour seems immature and kind of jealous - FYI in my experience (30M) every person I have been with who has been overly jealous or has flown off the handle about me communicating with others has ended up cheating on me at some point. 

Good luck, I hope you get this sorted. 

Be happy. "
"Yes, everyone including the senior program director signed the cards. The coworker apparently has also signed the cards of other coworkers in the past, so I don't know why it was a surprise. Maybe he just thought he wouldn't be included?"
"IT'S FACEBOOK. IT'S FUCKING FACEBOOK. I do NOT get why people raise shit for stupid unimportant things.... especially social media. You were right. This IS dumb. No don't do anything because if he really thinks this stupid shit matters, then you have a LOT more issues to worry about. And this is coming from me, a millennial. He is insecure. End of story. "
"So instead of respectfully, rationally breaking up with your emotionally unstable boyfriend, you cheated on him (in his own house), bullied him, and belittled his mental illness.

Did you tie the rope while you were at it?  Seems like you were toxic enough he could have died of poisoning long before the air had finished leaving his lungs."
"&gt; It is strange that he hasn’t reported what happened if he really thinks he was drugged. 

The same reason rape by females is vastly underreported. 

Not saying its not what happened but it certainly isn't strange."
"20 and 17 is a bit iffy as for age so I get the discomfort.


Are you sure you like him?"
"So she dragged you out of your party to dry her off, which she could have just done by herself, tried to steal your friends to go off somewhere else instead of staying at your party like you planned, talked shit about your boyfriend for doing what you asked him to do and can’t handle a last minute plan change to go get drinks, after you’ve already had dinner together AND publicly cried as a last ditch attention grab?  

Why’s she your friend?"
"Frankly, your behavior is a little frightening... "
"&gt; I think he's lying that this is the first time he's gambled.

No shit. Nobody goes 0-30000 in one week.  And hey, addicts, they LIE. This is an addiction.

Now if you love him, you can shove him towards Gamblers Anon but YOU NEED TO SEPARATE UTTERLY from him because this never goes away - at best he can control it for a while

he WILL drag you down with him

(Plus (IANA Yank) isn't that type of gambling ILLEGAL where you live?)"
"You sound defensive. The comment didn’t say “all men”. They specified men because OP’s post is about experiences at the hands of men. And statistically, men as a gender sexually harass at an astronomically higher rate than women, so it’s not shocking. If the shoe doesn’t fit, don’t wear it."
Selfishness is not the default for inexperienced lovers. Plenty of inexperienced dudes yearn to give pleasure. 
"Exactly, people like this need consequences, not continuous enabling.  :/"
"Sounds as though your brother is the golden child, and you are the scapegoat."
"&gt;  It just freaks me out, especially ouija boards and seances, that doesn't seem like a **safe** thing to do.

Okay, so you were raised southern baptist. But do you still subscribe to those beliefs? Do you really think that what your girlfriend is doing is ""unsafe""?

It's fine if you don't like this stuff. It's fine if it makes you uncomfortable. But you don't have any right to ask her to stop doing the things she likes. At best, you can say, ""Hey, can you let me know when you're planning a seance ahead of time so I can make plans to be out of the house? And can you also make sure to sprinkle salt in all the corners so nothing unpleasant gets left behind here?""

I will say though, as someone who also has an interest in the occult, I would be very disappointed if my partner wanted me to stop doing the things that make me happy. 


"
"This is a good answer.

I have some examples: 

My BFF wants to schedule everyone anywhere near her, with all of the time of each day booked/blocked for something. She's constantly battling it out with her hubs and kids. They freaking HATE it. She thinks they are lazy and not pulling their weight.  I think the truth is somewhere past the midline in favor of the hubs and kids. 

My sons always need to ""take breaks"" when we need to do chores. They are absolutely being lazy AF and we end up missing a lot of fun activities because it takes me too long to do the chores on my own. I'm not going to let up on the pressure because I don't want them to become 24 year old men who don't pull their own weight.

My own hubs is a break taker at ""all the wrong times"", meaning when it really impacts the schedules of everyone else, or when it means someone else is going to have to compensate for him, or lose out on something important to them. He constantly says he needs to ""relax"" whenever it's time to do things that SOMEONE must do, like go grocery shopping or do laundry. He was ""relaxing"" in the hour before teen daughter's homecoming and we were late. He was ""relaxing"" up to past the last minute to see a movie, or ""relaxing"" until the grocery store closed, that kind of crap. It will ultimately be the deal breaker, no matter how hard he works otherwise, because SOME THINGS JUST HAVE TO GET DONE, unless you're willing to seriously lower your standards.

OP, you might need to find someone whose interest and energy levels match your own. If I were your age again, I'd consider this behavior to be a deal breaker. 



"
" This. That day sounds exhausting to me. It's probably more than he can handle and more than he enjoys. Many people like to actually do *nothing* on thier days off. I'm lucky if I even make it to the store.  Its not wrong to leave your day off totally empty. 

Perhaps the issue is his communication skills more than anything. Does he suggest any of these activities or is he just going along with it to make you happy? It's very possible that he doesn't want to do all these things and just isn't able to communicate that effectively. "
This can get him kicked out of the gym and honestly I kind of hope it does. Mega skeezy. 
"Oh damn. Sorry there's no animal control around. That's super sad.

Just think - stay in school, get in a better situation, and you can rescue all the kitties you want. Stay on track. 

His parents are beyond weird. "
They won't once you've cooled off a bit from this relationship. You will be *enraged* at him for what he did.
"You may have to look and see what you can do as an independent student, instead of one dependent on parents for some contribution.

Just because you could end up close by, what do you think they would do? Kidnap you?
"
"There are certain immutable truths we all have about ourselves.  Some people are great at caring for mentally handicapped people.  I would not be one of them.  I know that about myself and that's okay.
If this responsibility is something you can't or won't take on, that's perfectly reasonable.  You're not the one that chose to have him and you're not responsible for him.  However, you do owe it to your parents to set that expectation.

""Mom/Dad -- I understand how you think things should be and I get why, but I am not qualified or capable of handling it.  I'll do all I can to make sure he has a good quality of life and care when you're gone, but I can't be responsible for doing it myself"".  Just keep saying it in a compassionate and caring, yet stern way."
They only way you're overthinking this is that you're still thinking about it and haven't dumped the guy already. 
"If you're hesitant, there's no push to. And don't beat yourself up. You trusted your then-boyfriend to keep intimate things private and then he betrayed your trust. He's the one you should be disappointed in. 

At least you learned a lesson on the permanence of intimate pictures and video. Best of luck getting this jerk into the trouble he deserves."
"&gt;Is what I’m doing wrong, or bad?

It is potentially *very* dangerous for you.

Big age, experience, and wealth gaps almost always mean that the person who is younger/inexperienced/less wealthy ends up trapped because they don't know how to identify troubling behavior when they see it. They tend to accept abuse as ""normal"" because they don't have the experience to know the difference. The older/wealthier partners tend to use their knowledge of the world to encourage the younger partner to do/accept things that people their own age would never do or accept. Moreover, you are both in such different stages of life that I cannot fathom (aside from physical attraction) any sort of romantic connection.

&gt;I know he’s a good and honourable man.

With respect, I disagree. An honorable man does not pursue such imbalanced relationships. They seek out equal partnerships with peers, rather than imbalanced relationships with dependents.

I hope this does not come across as condescending, but I suggest that you date people your own age/life stage/experience level and do some growing up *with* them."
Read your OP and replies. It sounds like you are in deep denial. Have this conversation ASAP. Can guarantee he either still says no or keeps it ambiguous as to sting you along a little more.
"When he says ""hes not good to you""  - you might feel like ""no! he is so good to me! he is better to me then anyone else has been!"". But that is actually completely besides the point. From his perspective, he isn't being as good to you as he thinks hes capable of. And if he recognises this in himself, he probably realises the reasons why hes not good to you and feels he is limitting himself. It's not actually about how well you feel he treats you. Trying to logically understand that from your own perspective isnt the way to go.

I think he has completely made his mind up and feel theres nothing you can really do, i'm sorry."
"I'm astonished the teachers, the doctor, her parents, OP's parents, the neighbours, people in the waiting room at the doctor's clinic (etc) haven't reported this to CPS at the very least.

A pregnant 12 year old is as close to black and white as you can get when it comes to 'needs an investigation, somebody is getting arrested' situations."
"Your girlfriend seems to have one of those dad's. That sucks. I doubt he has talks at all like this with his sons girlfriends. Oh well. Just be prepared to talk about your girlfriend like she's *his*. He's probably one of those dad's that assumes he owns his daughters sexuality - him meeting with you is him trying to act like he has a say in who she shares her sexuality with. Be prepared for him to run through the whole routine of ""I was a nasty pervert at your age so I know you are too"".

My advice is ask your girlfriend what she wants you to do. Give her some power back. The only time two men should meet to discuss how a relationship should play out should be when those two men are in a relationship with each other.

If she wants you to talk with him and you feel comfortable then go. But just remember, you are not a pervert. Don't let him paint you as one. Wanting to have consenual sex with a girl you love isn't perverted or ""disrespectful"". What is perverted is an old man assuming that when his daughter has consensual sex *he is being disrespected*. He doesn't own her genitals. He's the gross one."
"You and your girlfriend are so in the wrong on this, I have no words. 

Actually, I do : your girlfriend leeched off and used her roommate for her own needs, and you joined in the party. 

He didn't ""gift"" her anything if she promissed him she'll pay him back. 

Want to ""defuse"" this? Pay him the money he is owned. Set up a meeting with a lawyer to agree on a payment plan. Otherwise, deal with it in court. 

"
He’s an ass. I didn’t even notice that. That makes me feel even more aggravated for her. 
"I can't believe what I'm reading. You think he should've sent the *police* to check up on his grieving ex-girlfriend just because his wife **might** throw a jealous fit about it? And then tell his ex, ""Sorry, I can't get in touch with my wife to give me permission to come see you, so I'll send the cops instead."" ...?

I wouldn't want to have a friend like that.  "
"It's honestly impressive you've managed to make all your failings as a parent the fault of the women in your life with no blame put on you. Your ex wife is a piece of shit, your new wife is a piece of shit, and its totally not your fault at all if your a deadbeat or favor your stepchild over your bio kids. Plus if you ACTUALLY had your kids 80% of the time because ""random insult towards mother of my children"" they don't resent you because you weren't there for them and most likely because of all the hate for their mother that is spewing out of this post. God you don't even like the woman you replaced their mother with. She spoke to her dad every couple weeks and saw him some weekends with no alone time with him, you could like try to not make this about you and your ""the system screws men"" bullshit and see that's 99.9% likely not the case here. "
"Yeah, it's totally normal to have a male masseur give a woman a massage. You boyfriend is being irrational."
"&gt;It doesn't matter who makes what mess.

If one person makes more mess, that person should do more cleaning. If you clean as you go, and clean up after yourself— you know, like they taught us in kindergarten — it makes everyone’s life more pleasant."
"I think you just need to honestly reflect on why you thought it was ok to refuse to make an effort and to rudely shut your wife down because you felt uncomfortable. When a child is dying, everyone feels uncomfortable. No one knows what to say or do. Being stressed or anxious doesn’t give you a right to act out against other people.

I’m also not wild about you saying her miscarriage wasn’t that bad but she’s being “moody” about it. I appreciate that you were still making some kind gestures to her, but it sounds like your stresses are elevated in importance in your world whereas hers are minimised. It probably isn’t a walk in the park for her that her young relative is dying, yet there’s no acknowledgement of that at all in your post.

You describe being “an asshole” for the past few months and I have a sinking feeling that what you’re partially responding to now is that people outside the relationship noticed your behaviour and it may have more consequences for you than previous episodes. It should be sincere self reflection and a desire to be a good partner.

If she really won’t talk to you, write her a letter and give it to her. It doesn’t have to be grovelling, but it does have to be deeper than “sorry I snapped at you”. It has to show that you understand why she’s as upset as she is and that you can do better."
"I mean, it *would* accomplish a very popcorn-y update"
"As a former 'damaged child':

I was damaged. 

Raising me was incredibly stressful, unrewarding, hugely expensive, and frustrating. To put it bluntly, I was a huge bitch and the only thing worse than my attitude was the constant and very valid fear that they'd get a phone call that I'd offed myself.

I mean don't get me wrong, my mum loved me and was an absolute champion about it, but damn.

It was a herculean task. Downplaying that helps no one.

Literally the worst thing you can do for damaged kids is to give up on them once you've promised support, or to resent them. Because they WILL know."
"People often do petty things just to be petty, not expecting the other person to *die*. 

Cut the mom some slack. She was married to him for decades."
She can’t divorce him. She needs his $ for her farm.

"They have, at best, an extremely unhealthy codependent relationship. At worst, one or both of them are in love with each other. Sounds like your BF may be in love with her and possibly got friendzoned. 

You need to have a serious discussion with your boyfriend about healthy boundaries and whether he is able to set boundaries with her and this friendship. If he is unwilling/unable to do so, you need to decide if you can live like this for the rest of your life. If not, you need to reconsider whether you need to be in this relationship. 

I also recommend counseling for all parties involved. "
"I have families in Japan and I can tell you this ISNT illegal here. Many people from the older generation does this when their daughter in law does not want kids. Nothing surprising. I hope OP stays strong, she has alot on her plate. "

"I totally agree with this. I started commuting (2.5 hours total a day, just like OP, either driving or on the train) to my job which is 9-5 but I usually get into work at 8 and leave at 5.30 because of the train timetable so I have a heck of a long day. Awake from 6am, I usually want my bed by the time I get home at 7pm! But, after doing it for 5 months now I'm getting more energy. I come home and play video games with my boyfriend or we go Pokémon hunting outside. I think it's unfair for OP's boyfriend to be so pushy but I understand completely why he wants to spend time with her during the week - often that's the best time for couples to catch up. My weekends are almost always busy with family/friends doing stuff. My boyfriend is off to visit some old friends this weekend and I've elected to stay home and rest and do ""me"" things so I can stay recharged for next week. It's all about balance.

I used to feel like OP and couldn't imagine doing anything after a 12 hour work day but now I do lots of things and go to bed anywhere between 9-12 and I feel okay. "
I don't believe telling OP you find her situation hot is appropriate.

"Thank y'all for replying with that. 


Having *been* a teenage girl, I can look back and say I was a child at 15-16. I had zero responsibilities outside of my chores and curfew. I had no developed opinions about anything or any real experience with men. I was incapable of making adult decisions or having adult discussions or truly understanding that some relationships or sexual encounters are not healthy. 


I may have had a developed body but the presence of mind wasn't there and I feel like an adult male taking advantage of that naivety makes him a sexual predator. "
"This is a joke right? It isn't a ""sexist"" joke, just banter. What is the world coming to? I'm so glad I work in an environment where most people can speak their minds and laugh about literally anything. Both women and men get along, wow."
"&gt;Basically, would I be a bad friend of I stayed at mine and only went there twice a day to feed the cats and sort their litter box out? 

not at all, you can text your friend something like "" hey i dont feel comfortable spending time at your place i will drop by to care the cats twice a day""

"
"&gt; how do we know it's just a joke or if it's serious?

It's never a joke, other people just use that as an excuse because they know what they did was wrong. 


If you have that many people in your life who repeatedly, intentionally, test your boundaries and disrespect you just for fun, you might want to talk to someone about it. Because it should not be like that. The people you choose to have in your life shouldn't make a game of out of being disrespectful to you. "
"Sounds like your husband is ashamed of his preferences, and is using you as a cover to seem 'normal.' You deserve better than to be someone's cover."
"Well first off, congratulations. You are no longer dating a man who repeatedly cheated on you and may or may not be a pedophile. So there is that. Secondly, the only thing you can do in this situation is learn from it. He displayed some pretty big warning signs that you ignored. Don't next time."
"I guess it depends on the dynamic - but even if its a work-group, in my experience, SO's often drop by for happy hour, especially if this is something your group does semi-regularly.
Were you getting close to ""work wife"" level with this woman?  I gues it depends on how close you really were with her and if it crossed lines.

As for the woman in your apartment:
&gt;  6 times for 20-30 minutes before she asked me out. 

This isn't minor as much as you want to downplay it.  I mean...what did you talk about then?  I can't imagine being in the initial stages of *getting to know about somone* and you don't talk about yourself?  You never said:  I love X kind of food, me and my GF go to X restaruant all the time??

It really could go either way, but I'm finding it odd how many *single* women you are casually making friends with that this is a continual issue.  Don't you have male friends?  Do you hang out with them?  Do they have SO's you hang out with?  Are you friends with your GF's friends?  I'm sure it's because of the lack of context, but it really seems like you are selectively hanging out with single women instead of couples or other guys."
"Holy gaslighting Batman. She tried to blame you for an account she had set up. Those are some psycho level mind games. Like she knows she set up the account so she knows you know you did not. But she tried to argue that you had.

Get a lawyer stat. And I’d follow some of the advice already here and read up on how to leave someone who’s clearly nuts."
"&gt;We had a long debate how I thought this wasn't okay, and he argued it was entirely platonic

Even if it was platonic, it's your house and rules. He never asked and was obviously deceitful about it. At best it's still disrespectful of the relationship.

There's so many alarm bells going off here, you did the right thing. Come on, a sleepover bag lol. There's no coming back from that.
"
"I think what it comes down to is of you care more about making sure your kids are fed and have their needs met or are you more concerned about your deadbeat ex’s feelings?

It should be the former. You know what you have to do. I really do wish you the best and hope your situation improves soon."

"I feel like I’m taking crazy pills...why isn’t there more outrage expressed here at how absolutely disgusting it was to photograph you in such a state in the first place? And then to even consider putting these online?? OP this is outrageous, this guy is violating your privacy at probably one of the worst times of your life. His behaviour isn’t normal at all. 

What other intensely private moments will he find it ‘beautiful’ to photograph and share? Jesus. And don’t forget; once something is online it’s permanent. There’s no deleting it. 

OP I’m so incredibly sorry for your loss and I know you have bigger fish to fry now but please reconsider this relationship when you feel able. This guy seems to have no idea how gross his actions are. "
"Just lurking around here in relationships you can see the level of drama weddings create between people. I would not be surprised that this guy just fears his friends to freak out and get offended.

But OP should really invest in talking to him as adults do instead of playing mind-movies."
I already feel sorry for Sarah.
"This is pretty cynical and part of modern dating that is a bad trend.

You feel a genuine connection with new girl. You met and hit it off in real life. You have chemistry and are optimistic. You're not exclusive but what's the harm is seeing where it goes? Focusing on her and not ""spinning plates"". In the best case, this could be your wife someday.

Now if it doesn't work out with Sarah, you can go back to tinder and chat up Becca or whomever else you match with. No harm, no foul.

Modern dating has a ""kid in a candy store"" aspect where dates are replaceable, and the grass is always greener. However, don't underestimate the rarity and magic of a genuine connection. We like to think there's always another one around the corner, but by always looking for the next girl/guy you may not realize the value of the great new person you've just met. Something to think about.."
"She broke up with him. What ""break"" are you talking about?"
"I work in a very male-dominated field like programming. My guess would be that she, like me, has to be tough to get along with the guys at work. It’s stupid but if I don’t, feel I either get ignored or get hit on (some guys equate politeness with flirting).

Sometimes I get in “dude-bro” mode when I shouldn’t be, and I speak a bit more aggressively. Not an excuse by any means, just a possible explanation."
"I don't know much about allergies, so I don't know if there's any solution on that end of it, but I doubt it. 

I think you should encourage Haley to go to therapy. It's good for people regardless of whether or not they deal with mental illnesses or some major trauma, and I think it would really benefit her to be able to share her feelings in a judgement-free environment, as well as learn some tactics to be able to better brush off peoples' comments and overall emotionally handle this. It seems inevitable that it'll eventually get out that she's the one with the allergy; she might have an allergic reaction in front of people or have to explain to someone why she can't go to the dining hall, and it's better that she feels more comfortable with discussing it and handling the potential response *before* that comes up. "
"Have the pregnancy by the other man written in your divorce papers and signed by her. Please protect yourself.
"
Yeah - I need to update the pleadings you're right. Good lord... 
OP has made a post on his throwaway that he forgot logging out of talking about his gf being jealous of one of his colleagues. He's trolling /r/relationships most likely. 
"This! 

I have 8 tattoos and couldn't get VERY SMALL finger tattoos because no one would do them on me for that exact reason. I live in a city where almost everyone has tattoos and I don't work a job where it would ever matter. They still wouldn't do it. 
"
"I had 60 guests at my wedding and we had a great day, all for under 1000€ (including the rings and the dress).

If you are saving 1500$ a month, for several months, then to me it sounds like you *are* planning a ridiculously expensive wedding. That's because we are different people with different ideas on how much money is supposed to be spent on certain things. Just like you and your fiance.

My point is there's no “right“ way. As long as you're not in debt, can pay for everything you need (like food, a place to live, electricity, insurance,...), you're doing fine. 

The solution here is that he pays for the unnecessary things that he wants, you pay for the unnecesssary things you want, and when it's something you both want (like the wedding party), you both decide on a budget and plan the spendings together. Then you stick to the plan. 

To me it sounds like *you* have decided how both of you are going to pay for the wedding. Also you are making unnecessary sacrifices: why not meet your friends at home or for activities that don't cost anything instead of spending less time with them? And why restrict your diet like that? There are other less pricy food options."
"Exactly. I also think that seeing some stranger balled up in a what will likely look like a staged photo to most on the Internet will have zero impact—after all, OP is not their sister/mother/anyone who matters in their life."
"Don't let him pull the ""it's hormones, it's your pregnancy"" card when there is legitimately something inappropriate to be upset about. HOWEVER a piece of paper is not a big thing to worry about and as long as your husband agrees to firmly shut down any confusion there may be, it will be ok.

Do NOT message her 
Do NOT make this small issue a massive one. "
"&gt;my trust and boundary issues.

Sounds like a LOT is going on here that's beyond reddit's help. And I feel like a LOT of info is being left out here."
"That's $16800 money dollars.

that's a fucking car he's been pocketing."
"So you're mad at your sister, but what conversations did you have with your parents?"
"Those are all... normal things. You're being called crazy *by literal crazy people.* Your in laws have diagnosed mental illness, and your husband is a hoarder, which is definitely an undiagnosed mental illness. "
"Sounds like he’s perfectly able to talk about himself, which is convenient. "
*Laughs in American* (Where the drinking age is 21)
"Haha I know.  My word of choice would have actually been ""creepy pathetic POS sleaze"" but decided on ""pathetic hater"" as it sounded lighter.  

I tried to shut it down sooner, but wasn't aggressive enough in my wording.  I guess creeps like him won't back off until you get hostile.

Thanks for your feedback."
"See the comments towards the top. He forgot to log out of his other throwaway and posted a comment here from that account but replying as the OP. Heres a post from his other account-

 /r/relationships/comments/87v5di/my_25m_girlfriend_22f_is_jealous_of_my_excoworker"
"My guess if she has an epi-pen is she probably *is* allergic to apples and would have a reaction if she *ate* one. I’m guessing that small truth turned into an overblown fear with the idea of even being near apples killing her, and likely that her parents may have instilled this idea in her. 

I think speaking to a psychiatrist or therapist would probability be a very good step to take. A psychiatrist will have attended med school and likely understand a lot more about allergies than anyone on reddit, or your girlfriend herself. They can either gently help her through her psychological issues with believing in deathly apple allergies, or if I’m totally wrong and this is a real thing she deals with, they can help her work through the difficult feelings she’s having with school. 

Regardless, they’ll be able to get her whole medical history and can probably get down to the bottom of the whole apple thing and help her one way or another."
"I live in San Diego :) there's a tour group called ""Tourista Libre"" where an American ex-pat takes groups to different events in Tijuana.  Depending on how much Spanish you speak, it can be kind of helpful because they take care of the tickets and set up dinner at a restaurant before the show.  They don't do the lucha libre tour very often, but if you google it and find out maybe you'll be lucky! "
"Great comment except for the inaccurate attempt to differentiate ultimatum and deal breakers in this context. This subreddit is so ludicrous when it comes to the word ultimatum, there's no reason to be ashamed of having boundaries but one should be considerate of their approach to those boundaries."
"Yes, he's definitely not an active participant in the conversation. But I'm entirely clueless about how to include him if he doesn't **respond at all.** I pause between telling the story/expressing my thought a normal amount (this isn't a stranger but someone I've been with for 10 years, so I'm comfortable with our talking pattern which is healthy otherwise). But during that pause, he.says.nothing. Like he'll stare an uncomfortably long time, so I...just....continue? 

This is how our conversation goes if he tells a story:

Him: ""The event was crazy. Of all the people, Dave was there.""

Me: ""No way! Didn't they kick him out last time??""

Him: ""Yeah! He's a little looney. They had the BEST steak though [2-3 sentences about event]""

Me: ""Did you get to meet X??""

Him: ""Nah, he didn't come""

Me: ""Well, was it fun though?""

Him: ""Yeah, honestly, better than last year""


If this same conversation was reversed, it would go like this:

Me: ""The event was crazy. Of all the people, Dave was there."" *pauses

Him: *stare blankly

Me: ""He's a little looney. They had the BEST steak though [2-3 sentences about event]"" *pauses

Him: *pretends to see an ingrown hair on his arm, keeps poking it intently like he's extremely interested in the science of ingrown hairs and on a verge of a discovery 

Me: ""I didn't get to meet X though. Oh well.""

Him: *continues poking

Me: ""Better than last year though. I had fun""

Him: ""Good..."" *casually walks away to the bathroom.


At what point, do you think I should ask questions in the above conversation? I feel like it should be a natural back and forth. But maybe I should have questions prepped?"
"I don't think this is the case, because he'll go on and on if the situation was flipped. He can talk for hours about events he's attended, his work life, his social life etc."
"Everyone else has covered the overall situation fairly well.  But if it were me,  I'd just plan on showing up with your husband.  You can't politely invite one half of a married couple to a function unless it's a restricted event (employees only or men/women only), so it would be fair to ""just assume it was an oversight"" and show up.

Then make sure you are so sugary sweet to everyone that you practically ooze syrup."
"She’s his abuser. Even when asking about the light, she’s not asking what happened, she asked whether *it’s his fault*."
"I am there, 9 years in, 2 kids with my wife, knew it wasn't right, but got married anyways. I am just over half a year in and I hate myself for it.  

If you at all doubt marriage, do not do it. If you still love her, stay, but if there is no future, cut your losses. It is not worth it, not at all. They say it changes nothing. Until a few months ago, i would have agreed. It is not the same after. She knows she owns you and you know it to.  

Once you throw property and other sizable, other shared amounts of money, and children, it is that much more true. If you want them, these trappings are beautiful, comforting even, like a blanket; if you doubt it going in, you will quickly despise it. Like a life sentence."

Why are people calling this bullshit? What kind of cross examining shit is this? Friends can still be close but not be as close as they were before. Jesus christ. 
Why didn't you just date Julia if she's more important to you than your wife?
Doing this is literally part of rape culture. 
"What are you even saying? Are you hitting on OP? Saying how gallant you would be, coming to her rescue and “putting his ass to sleep” for verbally assaulting her?

This is messed up. Stop bragging about being willing to commit a crime (physical assault), even in a hypothetical situation. I’m sure you’re very tough, but it’s completely irrelevant to the situation. This is not a dating site."

Confronting the sister is a waste of time.  It's her parents who have enabled this gross invasion of privacy.   
"You really need to stop burdening your kids with this. You're an adult, they're your problems, get therapy or otherwise sort them out without putting upon your children. You're the parent, not the child.

Clearly they're out of ideas anyway as your daughter told you to post here. Maybe try taking some of that initiative yourself rather than relying on her. "
You only live once! Don't regret missing out
You don't owe him any explanation.  Get all the info/evidence together and go see a lawyer.  Now.  Then go stay somewhere else until the divorce is final.  Don't bother trying to explain a damn thing to this ass.
"Thats actually pretty cool, and probably really handy. I bet she loves it! "
"&gt; she has the right to invite anyone she wants to live there.

This might be petty, but doesn't that go both ways?

You got cousins who are down for saving some money short term? Give them your bedroom while you move out and go live with your kids. Bonus points if your cousins like to throw parties."
All romantic love is conditional. 
"In your brief post I see two yellow flags.

One is that he initiated all contact. That's a major turnoff and many guys in their 30s won't put up with that.

The other is you comment about boxes and, especially, height. While I'm not saying have no standards, if you go in looking for a big list of boxes to tick, you're going to have a bad time."
I could be way off but I don't get the sense that these people are in America.
"Sometimes you have to read between the lines - an ""excuse"" is a polite way of saying no, without sounding rude. Push back once, sure, *gently*, but then leave it alone. Sounds like you handled it well after the fact though by apologising and they've accepted it - that's way better than some people who'd make a big deal of it! And enthusiasm is good generally, so don't worry too much, just remember how this went the next time something similar comes up."
I have never made a post without at least three typos and yet I still haven't learned to proofread.
"Even if he has a 'type', it's pretty messed up that he keeps suggesting that she change herself in order to fit his 'type' better. "
"This; OP, this is a case where a white lie is definitely warranted. You could also say a kid at school came out as gay and now every time you start to laugh ad a homophobic joke you think of him and feel guilty."
"Police aren't mental health professionals. You can't force someone to have an intervention with a professional unless you contact a mental health professional on your dime. Getting the roommate to seek help is only possible through a heart-to-heart.

She's not threatening suicide, showing other signs of distress, or anything else alarming. OP didn't even know anything was the matter til she went in the room. For all we know, the roommate has been doing this for years. This is not a situation that needs help ASAP like some kind of emergency and won't be treated as such by anyone given the above details. The roommate will need to seek help for her own quality of life."
"Oh yeah, there was a really lovely update where they went to therapy and started slowly working together to get him to use the bathroom."
"He should stop pushing his ex on his kids. The idea that having a relationship with both of your both of your parents is important, even when one of them consistently makes terrible decisions and refuses to prioritize their children over themselves...is bullshit. It teaches kids that love looks really selfish."
"My man, that don't mean a thing. You are being taken for a ride it seems to me. "
"Whether it is mental illness or not, she knows something isn't right with how she acts and she should be taking steps to better herself mentally. It seems her parents AND you are both good support systems and if that's still not helping, maybe she needs a counsellor. Could be anxiety and depression, but she could also just be irresponsible. "
"Guy #1:

&gt; CAN'T be around him more than a few days a week because he's very energetic and I'm an introvert. He also makes me feel guilty about being an introvert a lot :/ He's an energizer bunny.

Guy #2: 

&gt;Not as attractive. He's younger &amp; ""cooler"" though, so I worry that he will leave me in the future. I feel less secure with him even though I know he loves me still. Maybe it's my own insecurity. I don't like his mom.

"She’s a member of the family, and she should have the same access. Will your daughter have a key? She’s not lesser than your child. "
"True, but it's nice to not have it actually be forbidden."
"Are you preventing her from seeing the kids?
"
"I didn't see this before, but CPS getting involved is very serious. If you stay in contact with your wife, who has physically assaulted you several times, and keep exposing your children to her (and you mention in another post she refuses treatment for her condition, so she isn't a safe person for your children right now), **you risk losing your children.**

You have to choose: do you want to keep your children or do you want the privilege of your wife fucking you over and over? You can't have both, because CPS will protect your children when their parents won't keep them safe.

It's hard. You remember the good times and how happy you were. Both the good and the bad are true *and* part of your wife. Rarely is someone abusive 24/7. Even the shittiest person can do nice things. Sadly, your situation with your wife is a ""shit sandwich"". This sandwich has all that you like in a sandwich: lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. And shit. If you don't like cucumbers in a normal sandwich, you can remove them and eat the rest just fine, but when you remove the shit from a shit sandwich, it's still a health hazard to eat the sandwich.

Your wife may have been the most wonderful person when you fell in love, but if CPS got involved the bad is really bad. There is no kind of good that makes that kind of bad okay. You can't change your wife and she is the one who has to get herself together and get proper treatment for her health. She may never do this, but for as long as she doesn't you should stay away from shit sandwiches and don't make your children eat them. Maybe one day she'll stop making shit sandwiches, but until then, stay away."
"Can you just make up some gay-rights related epiphany that means you can't laugh at your parents' homophobic jokes anymore? Like a friend that they don't know told you about their experience, or you read an article about Mathew Shepard or the fate of gay people in Uganda, or read a book that affected you and made it so you don't like to laugh about the issue anymore?"
"Looking at the top few comments, I think something that's being missed is that she specifically wants to have a child with you. With YOU.

It could very well be that having a kid with someone else would have no interest for her. This is 100% a conversation you need to have with her rather than a decision that that you can safely make for both of you.

I wouldn't frame the discussion as an ""or else I'll divorce you"". Rather as a mutual discussion of wants and needs.

You've done an absolutely magnificent job of making clear boundaries and wants with her. If you can maintain that then things should go better with a good conversation.

-AHMAD"
"You would love to have your stepdaughter 24/7 but mentioned in another comment that she can't just come over whenever she wants. So which is it? It seems like if you wanted her around more, you wouldn't have an issue giving her a key. Seems like you want things to stay firmly EOW. "
Probably why he goes after people 4 years younger than him and still in their early college years. 
"She brought it up because he invalidated her feelings. 
She didn't bring up the incident later, she brought up how HE made her feel when she was talking about her day. And she did it calmly and later on when she wasn't upset. I think she did a good job. And OP is right, he has a lack of empathy. He's hearing her words just fine, but he's not hearing her emotions. "
"I admit the intrusion of privacy was a big mistake on my part. But I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to it than what he was telling me, and I had to know. 

Even if I wanted to end it, how do I bring up the topic now that we have supposedly resolved everything, and he thinks all his good. Should I tell him I read his messages?"
"Sleeping two people in a single bed is *super* uncomfortable. Unless both of you are short, skinny people who don't take up much room you're not going to get any sleep.

Get an air or foam mattress and put it beside the bed. You can still cuddle and stuff, but I think it's going to be very difficult for you two to sleep in the same bed if she only has a single."
"I have DDD's. Bras are really not that uncomfortable even for me unless they're the wrong size. If op is small, she could easily wear a comfy bralette or the like with no wire or anything. Most if society does consider it sloppy and inappropriate to be flopping around braless in most places. It's not that out of line for ops husband to point that out."
"Letting things slide can become synonymous with letting them fester. Don’t let one incident become a festering problem; after all, any infection can be fatal if left untreated. "
"One could argue that you put your wife into an unfair position.  You've implied over the years that gifts don't matter.  Yet when you got a gift you're touched by -- you've now shown that a gift CAN matter to you.   That's kind of changing the rules on her.

I imagine what she's really mad about is feeling like your female friend had an unfair advantage that is making your wife feel uneasy.  She probably assumes (rightly or wrongly) that you have been acting overly close to this woman at work such that she'd feel comfortable giving you a thoughtful gift.   (Most co workers give each other a funny gift or no gift -- I think you know this, right?)

Your wife's reaction was over the top, but I can understand why she might be feeling off balance right now.
"
"Pretty much this. Everyone is focusing on the game and how it's not fun when she's fucking up, and they aren't acknowledging the fact that she's a person with a prior relationship with OP--and it sounds like this relationship will be damaged pretty badly if they kick her out."

"&gt;  Our country's culture is really bad about this whole ""man's work"" and ""woman's work"" stuff but that's not an excuse in my opinion.

"&gt;So a guy  across the street stood up for you and your boyfriend, who was standing right by you didn't?   

It's a lot easier to stand up for someone when you're further away, the chances of it turning physical are far lower. Personally, not that I would've done the same, but I could see why her bf didn't get involved.

Why are you helping him with his assignments?
"Grey rock your parents until you can move out. No, they do not have a right to be ""disappointed"". Please seek out therapy asap and don't let your abusive parents make you feel like a failure when you're the opposite of a failure!"
Among the other relevant responses in here I wanted to mention that you two got together when you were 20 and she was 18.  That particular decade (20 to 30) is the one where people are learning who they are and who they want to be and what they want to do with their lives and it's not uncommon for young lovers lives to go very different ways during this time.  Don't blame anything on yourself and try to not hold anything against her with an understanding that if she wasn't true to herself then you would both probably end up resentful over the disparity neither of you could admit to.  Or I could be way off the mark but I wanted that thought out there for consideration.  Good luck &lt;3
"Thanks for your perspective. I was already very, very low contact with her because of her past behavior. And she will never have unsupervised access to my child. Ever. Period. Thanks for the link to the sub. We'll probably end up there for advice/support."

"Which is really fucking selfish because any kids that they have will think that this kind of business arrangement is what a marriage should look like, and will repeat that pattern in their own lives.

OP doesn't even love her husband; she just sees him as a warm body that can help her have the family she wants.  This really stuck out to me:

&gt;Being at home with him is like being alone, but better.

That's so sad, and any kids they have are going to think this is normal and ok.  It's really not.  If they were living together out of convenience and not wanting to be alone, and it was just the two of them, then that would be fine.  But she wants to bring *kids* into this situation.  That's what I take issue with."
Yeah I wouldn’t be ok with this. Constantly hearing shitty things to / about you isn’t fun 
"That sounds so awful.  Are you still in college or have you graduated?  The best thing you can do is put yourself first, visit psych services and get some extra support and guidance.  You are your parent's child, not their parent.  It's terrible for your father to put you in this position, regardless of the wrongs your mother has committed.  Your parents are a danger to your health and happiness, and you might want to consider limiting contact with them if you can.  Regardless of the good they have done for you, you are NOT responsible for fixing their problems or being their therapist.  You're not your dad's drinking buddy, you're his son.  Have you ever thought of attending an Al-Anon meeting?  Forming connections with individuals who are also children of alcoholics might be very valuable to you.  I have mixed feelings in terms of telling your mom about your dad's adultery.  In one sense, your Dad doesn't deserve to have his cake and eat it too, taking advantage of the pros of his life with your Mom without actually being loyal to her.  But also, I feel like you shouldn't have to get involved, and would be justified in staying away from them completely, because they sound like dangerous, selfish people who will only hurt you.  If you tell your mom, you will be pulled further into their world of chaos.  That's why I think therapy would be your best bet, so that you can discuss the best way to deal with the situation and have someone there to support you during this terrible experience.  Good luck to you!  Hugs!  "
So ask him if it’s cool with him if you touch guys penises as long as the guy is probably gay. 
From now on whenever you do something with his stuff just go at half speed. My gf was the same way but after a while I noticed she was always trying to do things way to fast that it made her clumsy. Might be the same for you. 
This seems like kind of a leap
"My parents had a “pragmatic” marriage, as they are older, not American, and fairly traditional. They’ve been married for 30+ years, and are devoted to the family. They didn’t marry each other because they thought they were soulmates - they married because they were compatible personalities, and had similar goals. They’ve told me as much.

However, they are definitely each other’s #1 in terms of closeness. When my dad is overseas for extended amounts of time (due to job, elderly parents), he calls my mom every day. Just to talk, update each other, banter about the news. They never had those fireworks like your first marriage did, but they also aren’t as dead as you and your husband are.

A lot of people have issues with retirement because of the isolation it brings. It could be your wife is worried that she's going to become your own social outlet, and worried that you're going to be home all day doing nothing, not even housework. Really there are so many issues and concerns that she could have, that we all see, that you just don't want to see. There are no magic words we can give you to convince her this is a good idea, especially if you can't convince us. :) Good luck dude."
"Yo man,

I'm going to start with your concern about breaking about with her to have more experiences. Truth be told, if you're happy with your relationship, I wouldn't consider breaking it off for sex w/ other people. Sex is sex, and you're going to have better sex with someone you have good chemistry with then banging random people. I feel like a lot of people put the whole numbers thing on a pedestal when truth be told, it doesn't mean fuck all if you're happy, and you don't want to ruin being happy to have random flings.

Secondly, just tell her that you were a virgin, tell her the truth. You were scared / awkward and then just started rolling with it and didn't know what to do. The truth is almost always going to be your best bet, because then you don't have anything to hide. Throw that shit out there and deal with getting a rash of shit for telling a stupid lie, then move forward. 

Lastly, just talk to her about being intimate more often. Ask her what turns her on, gotta have that open line of communication if you want things to change. I get that med's can have an effect, but you guys are pretty young, it isn't like you're 60+ years old, you're just going to have to work on things. 

Also, try to get rid of feelings of jealousy, they'll pointlessly aggravate you when you weren't even in her life at that point, you got no reason to be upset. So she had a few sexual experiences prior to you? She experimented etc, found shit she liked or didn't like, just like everything else in life, no reason to hold it against her. And if anything, if you guys last, you'll be able to explore all of those different kinks and experiences, it'll be fun shit.

Don't stress it man, just be honest and be forward about what you want, no one can read minds. Good luck with whatever you choose to do, just wanted to give my two cents.

Take care"
"Yeah as a younger 20s female I call bullshit on this ""friendship"""
But it’s okay if you go to jail for threatening someone with that illegal gun and your wife is a single parent?
"While I agree that personality is most important, being physically attracted to your partner is also very important (MAYBE unless you're asexual). You may love someone that you don't find attractive, but you'll always crave something that person can not give you. In the end, you would most likely resent them, subconsciously or not. So I would say sexuality is just as important as loving someone for their personality."
"I've done a lot of therapy wrt regulating my emotions as well and they always stressed that fighting your emotions and judging yourself for having them just drags out your struggling. Saying, ”I shouldn't be feeling this way right now. What is wrong with me? I'm so illogical!” just makes you feel worse without actually addressing the root cause of why you feel how you feel.

When I started therapy it was partly because I was getting stuck in these loops where I would start crying about something and then I would get so upset at myself for crying that I could not stop. I was doing it at work. I would spend half an hour in the bathroom because I'd teared up over something someone said to me. It wasn't okay. And you know what? Once I learned not to beat myself up for crying in the first place, it was a lot easier to stop. It's much more ""zen"" to notice your emotions without judging and then let them pass. There is a huge difference in suffering between, ”God, I started crying over something so small. I'm so irrational. There is something wrong with me. I'm weak. Why can't I stop? I'm the worst person.” and, ""Huh, I'm tearing up. It is because I feel very hurt by what she said. I don't want to be crying right now, but it is understandable that I am. The sadness will pass soon and I will stop crying.""

It's understandable that you feel betrayed and need some time to work back up to trusting your husband. It's also understandable that you don't want to feel the way you feel right now and that you want to fight it. But you are just dragging out your suffering and making yourself feel worse by judging your emotions."
"This person is not listening to you when you have told him many times. After you have checked the tenancy laws, I believe the basic first step is to give him notice that he can't live with you anymore. But check your laws."
"&gt; He also said the way he acted during that time isn't a true reflection of him normally but he was ""emotionally checked out"" of that relationship for a long time and it was over long before it actually was. 

It means that when he decides that he is done with your relationship, he will go on to pretend that everything is fine until he lines up his next girlfriend. Even if he has to pretend ""for a long time""."
"&gt;I'm not the type who cries and wants comfort all the time. I'm not an anxious or needy individual.

Well you are when you're high apparently

&gt;it confuses me to see such a sudden switch in the way he acts towards me when I'm under the influence

He's probably annoyed that his girlfriend chooses to go from ""easy going"" to ""so high maintenance she can't even answer the phone and needs to literally be babied""

"I'd be worried that OP getting a lock is just gonna result in her sister hulking out on the door, resulting in OP no longer having even a door. "
"It sound like you don't vaule her as an equal partner. You get to make the decisions because you know better, and refuse to give her the full story why, for your own selfish reasons. She deserves to know how dangerous the area she lives in is, she deserves the right to decide if she is comfortable living in a house that has to be armed for safety, she also deserves the right to choose not to live there with all of that knowledge available. "
"I understand it feels stupid to you, but for someone with panic disorder it can be incredibly overwhelming. The fake crying can be a coping skill your husband uses to avoid confrontation. Panic disorder and general anxiety are completely different - where as you’re able to calm yourself down when you feel anxious, with panic disorder your body goes into fight or flight mode and that’s where the physical symptoms come in (in example your husband needing to go to the hospital). Therapy does help, as do medications but unfortunately he has to start to feel comfortable in therapy and learn coping skills before opening up about his panic attacks so he’s not triggered.

I understand it’s hard for you at the moment but that’s why you need to take care of yourself as well and learn to cope with what’s going on in your life and marriage and how this is all effecting you."
I read both and the comic specifically highlighted a wonderful point. Sometimes you can afford to get paid help. But I think that's not really a solution because a) it shows the uninvolved partner he/she doesn't need to step up and b) the help still needs to be managed and guess who's doing that?
"something to think about because i didn't see it mentioned here. 

like your boyfriend, i consider myself very gay friendly / an LGBT ally.

in my early 20s I dated a guy who revealed to me about 6 months into the relationship that he thought his sexuality was more fluid and he was attracted to guys as well.

this bothered me A LOT because the entire duration of our relationship, he had been making a lot of new guy friends, staying out all night with them, sleeping over at their places, sharing beds with each other if the night got too crazy (we were in college and partying a lot at the time). However, being your average young heterosexual couple in an exclusive relationship, it was an (initially unspoken) rule that he wouldn't have shared his bed with his female friends or gone on weekend one-on-one trips with other women without discussion. He expected the same consideration from me in regards to my male friends. Obviously, being bi doesn't mean he was attracted to all men, but then again, me being straight didn't mean I was attracted to all men either and he still would have been bothered if I had shared a bed or cuddled with a male friend. It's about boundaries in a relationship, what behavior is ok or is not ok with people you have a *potential* to be attracted to. So, when I learned he was actually bi, I felt a little lied to... I felt as upset as I would have had I learned he had been doing all of the above (sleepovers, bed sharing, friendly-cuddling) with other women. One instance in particular, he had a new coworker, they had hit it off and went to a concert out of state... my response to ""hey babe, I'm gonna grab an AirBnB with my brand new coworker Mark this weekend and check out the Third Eye Blind concert. It's an 8 hour drive from here! There won't be cell service!"" would have been different if it had been ""Jessica"" instead of ""Mark"". And that's what I felt like had happened, essentially. 

It could be that your bf is feeling very confused and anxious about previous experiences/friendships of yours that he saw as purely platonic and is now questioning, or feeling ""lied to"" that he didn't realize you had the POTENTIAL to be attracted to that person. I.e... Overnight girls trips with a brand new hot friend of yours suddenly seem like something he wouldn't have been too comfortable with, had he known. Or you cuddling up with a female friend on the couch would have made him uncomfortable if he knew, the same way he might not be cool with you cuddling with a male friend. Make sense?

It's a complicated situation, just wanted to let you know my experience being on the other side, maybe something to keep in mind when you next discuss these things with him. 
"
Oh yeah myself and every other woman I know march down the street with our heads high with the knowledge we are untouchable by male violence
"Your stepmom is not a good person. Your stepmom is abusive. When someone who has witnessed this abuse says to her victim ""but she's a good person!"" that is not a statement of truth or even their honest opinion. That is a silencing tactic. By reframing ""abuser and victim"" as ""two equally good people having a conflict,"" he puts at least half of the onus on you to resolve the situation, where ""resolve"" means ""whatever, just don't make me have to think about it or expend any effort to help you."" He is willing to let you be hurt so as not to inconvenience himself.

Don't stick around for this kind of treatment."
"Yeah, he absolutely realized he left a filthy mess that he should have cleaned up. That's why he scurried off to hide out in the garage when it came time for her to cook dinner."
"society doesn’t need people like this guy and professional sports teams don’t want guys like this anyway. if you don’t think you have the evidence to go to the authorities I understand your fear. if it happened to me I would still tell my friends though, and get a new room mate so I could avoid the chance of seeing Mike. "
"I feel like I should say the house isn’t a pit, it just has crappy drywall that needs anchors to put up curtains and the previous owner was a contractor and appears to have half finished the basement with Sheetrock puzzle pieces. His biggest issue is that the cable line was cut at some point so when we finally got decent internet they had to string a wire across half the property (and will bury it come summer) and that the house isn’t properly wired so the internet router ended up in the basement not his office. I feel like there is no such thing as a house without issues, but perhaps I am wrong. 

He uses the divorce word a lot, and seems convinced I’m going to cheat on him because all women want bigger dicks in their lives. Someone else pointed out that he has lots of grand ideas he doesn’t stay committed to; I do wonder a lot if I’m one of those ideas. The horses are a time suck but I feel very conflicted because I get criticized for not riding and using them and get criticized for not spending time with him, though he is never denied my time when he asks. Most of our time spent together lately is him wanting me to sit with him while he watches whatever he wants on Netflix (my choices are boring) so if anything, I feel I’m not getting a return on my time investment (joking)."
"Sorry, I misunderstood - got all emotional reading about the dog-kicking."
Just want to mention that the diagnosable level of depression is feeling dysphoria and/or lack of pleasure from things you normally enjoy for at least two straight weeks. Just something to keep in mind if this continues.  
"I’ve known a few riders/owners and those giant animals are a major timesuck. 


It sounds like you are willing to compromise though and realize his situation and feelings are at least somewhat justified (long commute, quality of house, etc.). Sometimes a bad commute on a particular day really sets me off and maybe he was just on edge when he called you, but the fact that he has used the word “divorce” before is very troubling. He might be looking for an excuse to jump out of the marriage and is starting to look for reasons to do so by issuing out of the blue ultimatums. 


What other times has he threatened divorce?"
That's what I did...I had about 40K of debt instead of 120K when I was all done.
"And it’ll be a constant moving goalposts thing. Once he gets this batch of cheating indicators correct, there’ll be a whole new set of them. Rotten tomato in the garbage? CHEATING! Unseasonable light rain? CHEATING! Taylor Swift stealth-drops a new album? CHEATING! "
"This, OP. 

I know you’re feeling down and she treated you very poorly, no doubt, but when we’re depressed our loved ones sense that and it can put them on tilt too. 

It sounds to me like you guys need to work on your communication and be perfectly clear that you know what each other really means when they say or do something. Otherwise these miscommunications seep in and resentment brews. 

Best of luck!"
If she had a legitimate phobia she would have said something immediately.
And yet here you are talking to strangers about your feelings. Is it easier because it's anonymous?
"It should scare you. It would scare me, too. It sounds like more than just a disconnect...to not think the baby was cute would be one thing and would even be understandable, but to go as far as to say you ""betrayed"" him by assuming spending 30 minutes with a baby changed your entire mind about having kids is a whole other thing.

Let me put it this way: Maybe watching you do so well with the baby scared him. Understandable to a guy who clearly doesn't want to have children. BUT, a level-headed guy would NOT have been so vicious in his response. The way he responded was not just simply mean, it was manipulative, and that's what did not sit well with me. "
"I suspect it's a variant of this.  It's also possible she kicked it in order to reveal the condom but didn't do it (i.e., the wife did)."
So... you're actually blaming her for the fact that YOU FUCKING LIED? I hope she leaves you.
Come on. Seriously?! SISTER endangered BIL's health and betrayed him. SHE meddled in her own marriage. Her cheating was absolutely BIL's business and OP was right to tell him. 
"He's definitely mad that I've managed to move on and get my shit together without him. He knows I've been sleeping with guys, because he asked me and I was honest. He said he didn't care, but he obviously does lol"
"Yep...  you were an asshole.

Actually in your responses you still sound like an asshole.

I don’t blame your friend for blocking you,  I just hope it’s a good lesson that people don’t like assholes and in future you should think of others instead of thinking your opinion is more important than others feelings.

"I would have stopped being your friend back then, but it's over now. You are almost 30 and passive agressive Facebook posts should be beyond you at this point, I suggest you start focusing you attention internally to make changes for yourself rather that drive everyone away with unsolitied criticism of how they choose to live there life."
"I've been that person. It wasn't a lack if mindfulness, it was more that I wanted to be able to revisit the messages sent to me without the full incrimination of my responses if someone were to see them. 

I have also been the person that just didn't shut it down with some guys that refused to get the hint when I didn't respond. 

So I can see both sides, there's really no way to know without pulling phone records."

"Well the idea is that you would accept people at their word, it'd be patronizing to tell people what they do or don't want. Most women do stick with what they say, some don't. When they don't, just leave, which is what most of this post is advising.

It's ok to change your mind, it's ok for your partner to leave you if your change of heart is a deal breaker. That's the risk you take when you change your mind in a relationship."
I would consider it. I think for me the main issue is not wanting to deal with the baby stage and the toddler years. 
Alot of people including from metoo have been very vocal about how that was wrong and disgusting. 
"It sounds like you could benefit from therapy to get over this. Seriously, you sound like you think that having you around should be enough to correct a chemical imbalance in her brain and it’s not. My fiancé has ADHD and when he doesn’t take his medication he’s absolutely unbearable. It’s not at all the same as taking recreational drugs "
My suggestion (from somebody that has a great partner but some kind of underlying anxiety issues) is that even if you've never been a shitty partner before you should have began by only comforted him cause as you said he was **obviously distressed**. The fact that you keep focusing on this lamp while your partner was on the verge of having a panic attack is really making me uncomfortable and I think make you a shitty partner still. 
"""how can I take you to vegas, I can barely handle you at red lobster"""
"&gt; ""I get it you're sad. I am too but I don't bother you about it."" When I talk about wanting to break up, he will accuse me of being selfish and unempathetic.

Wow. So your boyfriend thinks each of you should suffer your individual problems silently? What's the point of the relationship then? Sounds like he basically wants a roommate who can pay his share of the bills and also be his chauffeur.

Also, he definitely DOES both you with his issues:

- You pay the bills, because he can't get a good paying job
- You drive him to work because he's too anxious to drive (uhh the solution to ""too anxious to [insert thing here]"", btw, is ""get therapy and medication"", not ""avoid [thing]"")
- He vents his bad feelings on you by insulting and verbally abusing you

So. You need a plan to get out.

1) Find a new place to move into -by yourself- ASAP. Have your move-in date be at least one month before the lease ends. Do this secretly.

2) Rally your friends to help you do a one-day move. Schedule the date.

3) Move any important documents or irreplaceable keepsakes to a friends house before this next step, in case he decides to revenge-destroy your stuff

4a) Tell your BF the day before that you are moving tomorrow, that you have paid your share of the last month's rent so he will not be immediately homeless. Stay at a friend's house that night when the argument winds down or starts to repeat itself. 

4b) Don't tell your BF in advance, just drop him off at work and then have your friends help you move everything while he is out. Leave a letter with the information he needs to know (rent is paid, he's got a month to figure his situation out).

Pick A or B depending on:

- Does your BF ever leave the house for a day on the weekend (ie, the time your friends are most likely to be available to help you move)
- Is there any chance your boyfriend will damage your stuff in revenge?
- Is there any chance your boyfriend will become violent?
- Do you just not want to deal with a long exhausting argument

OP, you have been telling him for a LONG TIME that you are unhappy. He has repeatedly shown he is not interested in trying to solve the problems in the relationship that affect you, and in fact, is absolutely willing to wear you down with words and guilt until you feel bad about HELPING YOURSELF. You owe him no warning here - the warning was in the years of you saying ""this isn't working"". You have tried, and tried, and been SO generous with your money and your time and your love. Like the airline safety videos say, you have to put on your own oxygen mask before you can help anyone else. Save yourself, OP!"
"Yeah, I probably wouldn't have an issue with romping on the bed, but I don't let my 80-pound pibble even in my room because she's huge and gets the bed all hairy. Totally personal preference thing.

I think that some people who are tripping aren't quite aware that their deep thoughts on the universe and general tripping can be quite annoying to the sober people around them. If you used to do it around her a lot she might have just gotten sick of it?

Other than that it could just be a compatibility thing. She considers doing drugs something that people stop doing once they become ""proper adults"" and you believe that as long as you spend time with her during the week you should be free to ""get fucked up"" on the weekend. If you can compromise on it you should try to but I think she needs to back off on the morality thing and you need to back off on the idea that her opinions on drugs are the mainstream view and yours are the ""enlightened view"". I think you still have to remember that what you're doing is actually still technically illegal, which might be her biggest worry."

"You're not overreacting. There's a strong chance he's cheating on you. Why else would he delete the conversation? 

To walk through it: He knew you were going to ask to see the conversation, he had to make a quick call on whether to let you see it or delete it, he had to know that deleting it would make you suspect he was cheating, and he chose to delete it anyway, which means there's no way that what was in that conversation was less incriminating than him cheating. I.e. There's no way he thought that you seeing a conversation he was having on ""relationship advice"" would upset you more than thinking he's cheating on you, so if he has a brain in his head he'd have let you see the conversation if that's all it was. Unless he's an idiot (always have to add in the ""idiot"" disclaimer)

"Thank you so much for your long and thoughtful response. I really appreciate you taking the time to type all that out and all the nice things you said!!!

So far all his passions are things he was into either before or during his military career. I have no idea what causes him to lose interest, and neither does he. They stop as suddenly as they start. Once he loses interest, he has nothing going on for a week or two and then is full throttle onto the next thing. 

I’m happy to hear that you think me setting the boundaries is a good idea, I didn’t know if that was me being too controlling or not. 

Your response really made me smile and feel like I’m doing something right. Thank you so much, I hope you’re having the best day! "
"&gt; I say he is a dirtbag.

I say you need a bit more empathy. He should have approached informing her about his perspective without applying any pressure, but it's understandable to freak out about the idea of pressuring someone into 'murdering their unborn child' and causing that level of resentment and pain in someone. The situation is harder for women I would say undoubtedly, but it's also supposed to be a hands-off decision (not your choice, not your body, etc.) with the guy anyway.

You're right that he should have informed her properly. You're right to criticize for that. But you're also so quick to apply ""dirtbag"" status in a situation difficult for all involved."
Make sure he treats your little girl the same as the boys. Including if she wants to play with traditionally male toys or is interested in traditionally male things like math or science. Or if she wants to be a girly-girl that he accepts that too. And same goes for you :) It's horrible to crush a child under gender expectations...
Ask her out and date her or let her get on with hooking up with other people.
"This! While I was reading I was thinking ""Holy shit he sabotaged her birth control to trap her into staying with him."" 

Maybe I'm being dramatic, but my hinky-meter is telling me he's going to turn full on abusive as soon as she has the baby and signs the marriage certificate. 

OP have an abortion (tell him it was a miscarriage if you're scared he'll freak out on you) and get tf away from this guy. He's extremely manipulative and showing signs of abuse. "
"Apart from that, 1.5 years is not that long. The time frame from when they met and moved in is kind of short too (6 months or so).

You are young. Rushing in a marriage might just mean you'll rush out as well."
"Agreed. But he just sees her as his sister, remember? His sister that he doesn’t want his wife to hang around with because he thinks his wife will be a third wheel and he and his sister don’t want to include her? He’s totally got his head on straight. "
My sister suspected that my manager might be acting this way due to sexism. Honestly I can’t say for sure. He does manage five of us directly and I’m the only woman. I never see him act this way with the guys and according to reports it isn’t because of my performance; I’m his second strongest employee.

"So because you've been dating this douche for 2 years, do you think that you have to settle on him for marriage and children *forever*? Do you truly believe that you can't find (or don't want) a better partner who actually has an iota of respect and care for you? Is this really the person you want to father your children? Making a mistake for 2 years shouldn't mean making that mistake the *rest of your life*. Do you think he would be a supportive, attentive, caring, nurturing husband and father? Do you think he would put in even a fraction of the effort you put into this relationship in order to sustain a lifelong marriage and partnership? Do you think that he will be able to stand by you, support you, through all the trials that life with throw at you? Do you think he would take care of you and the kids if you got sick?

Dig deep and find some self-respect. Stop dating who you wish this guy was, whatever potential you see in him, and realize that he is *not* that person, and you need to date (and break up with) him as who he is right now, not what he could be or what you hope he'll be. Why are you torturing yourself? Because he's nice 10% of the time? Do you really only want to date 10% of a good person?"
"&gt;if she were a man no one would be on my wife's side here.

Bullshit, nobody would be okay with you ditching your wife and kids on a landmark birthday. No, you're not cheating, but you're also not being at all fair to your wife and kids.

&gt;I DO understand that some people are not okay with that type of thing.

Your wife is one of those people.

Nobody can force you to not go on this trip, but your wife doesn't have to put up with your bullshit either. And I hope she doesn't."
"You’ve got this! Definitely stay with your parents while the initial shock is going down. Hopefully he gives up pretty quick but it’s better to not be alone. If he shows up unannounced, just call the police and tell them you’re scared and you’d like an officer. And don’t let him inside. "
"Look, if you already have this fear, then it means in your heart of hearts you already know he doesn't want kids.

Just end it. You're just playing yourself at this rate. You deep-down _do_ understand his stance, you just don't want to admit it could be true, and you're both stalling for time.

Pushing him to say for sure ""I definitely don't want kids, ever"" is unlikely to happen. Early in dating, he already said he never had interest in having kids. That's as definitive as it gets while being polite; you're just holding out hope. Other guys would probably have said they liked kids, or if they weren't sure, ""Not sure, but I'm open to kids"". 
"
"Not the first time but we've had very limited contact. Occasionally when I come over to pick her up or something similar I see him and greet him. I had not thought about what you said of him inviting me again, that makes me feel a lot better. Thanks!"
"While it's nice of you to offer support, try and look at this from your wife's perspective.  You two should have approached this as a couple and identified whether going to see your ex was comfortable for your wife.  You took it upon yourself to do this.
Your wife clearly stated that had you talked to her the situation would have been okay and she would've accompanied you.  Therefore, it doesn't sound as though your wife is angry that you went- it appears that your wife is angry because you were not fully open about the situation and went into a vulnerable ex's house with no context besides a text message.

Respect your marriage and make your wife a part of your decision making.  She needed to be consulted about this, especially since you know her viewpoint on the ex.  If she's as amazing as you say, she would've understood.

"There's yelling and there's yelling. His SO sounds like a nightmare so I can imagine her yelling makes him cry. The solution for this is obviously not ""growing a thicker skin"" but dumping her. In my experience telling people to ""grow a thicker skin"" is something mean people say to excuse their shitty behaviour.
"
"Absolutely don't meet up, in public or private. This is yet another example of her putting her needs first, and having zero interest in what matters to you. This dynamic has defined your entire relationship, sounds like you've got out by the skin of your teeth, so don't get back involved for any reason. And make no mistake, she'll keep trying to come up with reasons, up to and including threats, accusations, and lies.

As you say, she's being irrational, *and you can't apply logical reasoning to an irrational person.* It's not your job to give her closure - that's something she needs to figure out herself. If you meet in person she'll pull out every manipulative tactic in the book to get her hooks into you again - it's textbook. She doesn't get to dictate terms of a breakup - stay far away from her for your own mental health. Doesn't matter what she says about you - her opinion doesn't define you, and someone who's treated you this badly doesn't deserve any more of your time or emotional energy. "
"I got my drink spiked over a decade ago. I used to be a hardcore party girl who did a tonne of recreational drugs and drank. I also take prescription drugs for a long term condition. My tolerance for both substances and hangovers was high.

I have never felt as ill in my entire life as the day after I got spiked. I literally lay down on a street in the city of London while trying to sort out my stolen bank card because I felt so unwell I thought I was going to die. I have no memories of the night before during the drugging and huge parts of the next day missing too. 

I don't remember anything after lying down in the street until 'coming to' in my room 10 miles away a couple of hours later. It didn't occur to me I'd be drugged til I saw a friend later that night whose house I'd gone to the previous night who described my behaviour as 'like being possessed' and so unlike myself she was terrified (and we were party buddies so she knew me well.)

Next day covered in bruises and injuries I trotted off to the police to report it. They still found traces of sedatives, SSRIs and opiates in my system and suspected GHB as well from my disihibited behaviour described by others (this a really common response to things like and Rohypnol often being uncontrollable rage or inappropriately sexual behaviour often used to discredit the victim.)

GHB has a really short 'half life' in the body so rarely shows up past 12 hours in blood or urine and many drugs tests are inconclusive for the same reason depending what they are. But getting your drink spiked is fucking terrifying and having someone get angry with you for being the victim of a crime is such a betrayal.

Everyone blamed me even when it turn out my 'best friend' had allowed a guy to spike my drink and then gang rape me because I was awful under the influence and then didn't react like a nice apologetic victim for things I didn't know I'd done while I was drugged.

You may never get to the bottom of this so you need to ask yourself, which are you more worried about? Your birthday getting spoiled or the thought that your BF was drugged and ending up in a state? Here in the UK, drink spiking in clubs is incredibly common and often not aimed as specific person. I imagine it isn't that unlike other Western countries."
"But he said he wants to be there for this sibling. 

Of course he can resent whoever he wants for whatever reason he wants. But continuing on resenting a nine year old who did nothing wrong and whom he also wants to support probably isn’t the healthiest thing. It’ll just lead to guilt and anxiety. "
"In some families, you're not ""family"" until you're married in. And if you can afford your own ticket, why haven't you gone there yet? 

And you make it sound like your BF is always jetting off for fun, but then at the end of your post, you mention ""another of his foreign work trips."" There is a difference between traveling for fun and traveling for work."

"I've said it my post but no, this is not normal for her. Usually, my wife is a caring mother to our daughters and besides a couple of fights between them, they have a great relationship. She doesn't have a history of overreacting in the past and I am at a total loss. 

But now that I think about it, something does stand out. When we were talking about it I remember my wife telling me that when she was Alice's age, she didn't have time for dating and boys. It's not much but maybe, in some way, my wife is perhaps jealous of Alice and is trying to make it as a bad thing. I don't know, I am probably pulling stuff out of my ass but it's the only explanation that comes to my mind."
"This needs to be higher. 

OP, please, PLEASE take this seriously and take this advice to heart.

"She cheated and let her husband raise and love a kid that wasn't biologically his and only now, out of her own selfish guilt, is she considering telling him the truth. That's not love. That's not one instance of cheating or one lie. That's 8+ years of lies."

"My bf knew I was buying it. So did his mom. He told me. We didn’t make an agreement on anything cause I didn’t think this would happen. But they knew. They knew I was buying it. His dad even showed me he’s kept track of how much I’ve given him. They feel bad they didn’t mean for the truck to get taken away but they’re avoiding me in talking about giving me my money back even though they said they would. If he kicked me out I could move back into my parents house, but I left there for a reason. It would suck but I could do it but I don’t do it cause of my bf. He wants me to stay. He feels guilty even though I know it’s not his fault. "
This is beyond reddit you need to see a therapist ASAP it was not your fault though. sorry for your loss.
"Nope, you don't. Honestly if he can't see how manipulative and controlling he is, or how unpleasant and inequitable this relationship has become for you, talking this out isn't going to do anything. 'Demanding' a reason is simply another control tactic; he's trying to make you feel this isn't over for as long as you have these open conversations or until he agrees it's over and it simply doesn't work that way. If you've called it of, it's off. Prepare a short phrase you can repeat to him as necessary if he makes any further demands, something like ""This relationship hasn't worked for me for a while. I wish you the best."" Giving him the reasons only gives him opportunity to argue, convince, gaslight, and twist the circumstances in his favor. "
"&gt; If she is on gonewild and you don't like it or feel jealous THAT IS YOUR FAULT.

I'm not going to argue with you over something that you wrote. Every time you deny it I'm just going to copy-paste the above.  

&gt; So if watching open isn't to fap to it, please explain why he or anyone watches porn? I am at a loss to why someone would watch open then?  

Alright I'll give this a try. It's a two step process.  

1. Watching porn is to fap.  
2. HAVING SEX IS MORE THAN FAPPING.  

I'm very worried that I have to explain this to you. If you're young and haven't had sex yet, then please just believe me. If you're a functioning adult: **Please stop treating sex the same way you treat a fap session.**  

Regarding the rape thing:  
You keep claiming that _because_ OP watched porn, he _should have instead_ had sex with his girlfriend. Here's some shocking news. **You don't get to decide when another person is in the mood for sex.** Watching porn is not consent. That's entitled and disrespectful garbage thinking. "
"And I babysit my 5yo nephew a lot actually....ever since he was about 2. And every summer I help my mom with her grandneices and grandnephews who range in age from 3-7 yrs old and have for a while. 

I also minored in early childhood development and my sister is an early childhood teacher/early childhood psych major. I did check and ask if I was asking too much of a 4yo to not do this - especially when reminding her each time she's over. She told me no, and if she's still blatantly doing it each time she's  doing it on purpose due to no consequences. Because she knows nothing will happen if she does it."

"You're just gonna need to suck it up and tell him ""no"" and stop letting him boss you around when you guys aren't at work.

"You're paying them to be there, not the other way around. Get your parents involved to have your back enforcing your understandable boundaries.

"When it comes to people like this, there is no managing it other than taking the way he treats you and not saying a word to him about it.  Its his way or no way.

what you can do is try to occasionally contact your sister, not so often so as to be obnoxious, but more often the 3-5 years between.    send her a christmas/birthday card and letter.    every time, send her a small note letting her know you love her, and something along the lines of how you're willing to do whatever it takes to rebuild your relationship on her terms.

Frankly I just don't see any point in fighting this battle.

Now, a decade later, we have found one another again and have been so in love the last 4 years. We plan to marry in the next couple of years and have been building a beautiful life together. Obviously not everyone's first experience goes the way mine has, but that's really not the point. Dismissing a 14yo's capacity to explore dating in a healthy and open way is an excellent way to make her do what she wants in secret. Please be a safe haven for your daughter, she needs guidance, not to be shamed for having a normal and healthy interest in a boy. "
Refuse to spend any time with your boss outside of work hours- if he's going to treat you like that then never interact with him in a non-work setting. Just tell him you're with someone else/doing something and leave. Also ask your friends to be confront if need be
"If someone I barely know shows up at my work place unannounced and uninvited for a social visit, hell no, I'm not going to go talk it out with them.

I could see your point if she had called OP, or sent her a letter, but this is just really weird and inappropriate imo."

"I'm trying to think of a more massive betrayal, but my imagination is failing me.

You should feel bad.  **And you should keep these bad feelings to yourself.**  Don't show yourself to a coward on top of everything else and mewl after your fiance for reassurance.

You really need to fuck off.  You did fuck all to deal with your issues and instead soaked in the soothing waters of misogyny, seeing all women as One Monolithic Faithless Woman, and now you want forgiveness for treating your gf as interchangeable with your previous gf?

What, do we all look alike to you or something?

You want to save this?  I really wish you wouldn't.  I really wish you would just set your gf free and amicably coparent the baby.

But you will insist, won't you?  Okay.  Therapy for you, alone.  Intensive therapy.  In the  words *Seinfeld,* you need to go to Vienna and have therapy 24/7.  

Perhaps the most appalling thing here is that you ""forgot"" about the DNA results.  **No one in their right mind believes that this was an accident.**  You felt horribly guilty and wanted your gf to find out so that you could be punished.  **Oh, and then you want her to comfort you!**

It's been allllllll about you, every fucking moment of it.  You are a terrible human being and if you are truly capable of feeling for another person (doubtful), you will break up with your gf.  Think of it this way:  you will actually do a good thing, with the bonus of being able to feel even more sorry for yourself!  Win-win!"
"I think basically you've broken her trust. She must have trusted you pretty solidly to agree to have a baby with you.

But then you went and did something behind her back that shows that you didn't trust her - but you also didn't let her know how you were feeling or what you were planning. You kept these things hidden from her and snuck around.

So the relationship at this point isn't what she thought it was. You are not on the same page she thought you were on.

Also, the fact you didn't put your baby in the title of the post and only mentioned him briefly... are you finding it hard to connect and bond with him, OP? Is that part of what prompted the test?

I think you need to show your fiancee that you understand the situation and her feelings, and then you need to seek help for the trust issues.

Earning her trust will take time, and it will be complicated if you don't trust her either.

"OP seriously be super, duper careful.  Take this seriously.  People do wild things.  I knew a woman once who I just felt uncomfortable with and who seemed a litttttle too obsessed with me (even though there was much less indication than in your case) and it ended with her locking me in my own goddamn apartment and threatening to kill herself in front of me for two hours if I tried to leave so I would ""understand the pain"" that I caused her by not being her friend.  When I finally convinced her to leave the apartment with me, she promptly tried to break back in.

"&gt; “Have you showered or brushed your teeth today?”

Not mean, but also just subtle enough that an unmotivated person can comfortably ignore your prodding without much consequence.

Unless he's extremely awkward, he likely understands what you're implying, but he obviously doesn't want to do it. You're right that you can't make him, but you can be a bit more direct so that he can't completely avoid the issue. 

Something like, ""Hey, since we've been living together, I've noticed you haven't been showering or brushing your teeth as regularly. Is everything OK? I don't want to hurt your feelings, but it's difficult to be intimate with you don't shower and clean your teeth. Would you be willing to work on that?""

"Oh sweetly ... he’s not interested. Some men will back off to get a hold of their feelings and then re-initiate contact (the quintessential “hey stranger” texts).

Get back on tinder and keep it moving.  "
"A lot of the time, no. I grew up really poor and we went hungry a lot. I think that's why. To my mouth all food is good food. "
"Wrong.

It's manipulative on every level! There is no way this plan goes down without it leading to massive violations of trust and respect. There is also LITERALLY NO WAY connecting her weight to her worth as a potential wife is going to be emotionally and mentally healthy for her or for your relationship!

Terrible, no good, awful idea. Please stop even thinking about using a proposal as a weapon. It's not a prize in this scenario! It's a weapon.

(Also, frankly, if your conviction can be bought that cheaply, you should consider just compromising already and getting married because it's clearly far more important to her than to you. You're open to that compromise it seems, so be open to it. As for weight and health, think of another plan.)"
"It is but it needs to happen because she will begin to see the difference in how you behave towards her... and you don’t want to let it fester to the point where you finally tell her but you’re too blunt with your opinions. Then there will be damage.

Your feelings matter too and so does attraction. I’m all for this movement of accepting ourselves and loving our bodies... but I hate the people who say, “I don’t care how you feel, if you’re not sexually attracted to me when I’m 100lbs+, you’re ignorant and shallow.” That’s not how it works.

Even as the ex-fat girl (used to be 320lbs), I understand how weight can change a person’s level of attraction. 

I wish you all the best. Maybe research online how others have approached this. I’m sure there are loads of articles with plenty of different avenues for you to consider. Ultimately, let it flow from the heart."
"I bet she had a rocky start in jasons life and wanted to just seemlessly fall into it and when he was resistant to that because his mom had died she took that personally. And now everyone is just naturally happy around OP and she DOES just fit right in and yeah, claire is jealous. OP's bf should be told she did this, because I'm sure she's going to keep up this kind of behavior and they need to be a team in the face of it."
"Wow, your poor mother.   Her husband cheats (and cheating isn't just about the sex.  It involves lying, manipulation, gaslighting.  It truly is an emotionally abusive cluster.) and now her daughter is  playing wanna be DIL to the cheating ex and homewrecker.

That has to sting.   To your mother, that probably feels like an additional betrayal.

I'm sure she understands your connection with her ex.  And it would be an adjustment to whomever he ended up with...but the mistress?  That is never going to go away.

My advice?  Give your mom a little more credit.  Give your b/f's mom a lot less.   If this relationship turns serious plan on eloping.  The wedding will be a logistical and emotional nightmare."
"Like even if they couldn't find him there would be warrant for his arrest. Good luck never getting pulled over or having to interact with the government in any way. He must have the mindset of a child if he thinks he can do this and run from the police the rest of his life especially since it's a felony, he'd have the marshals after him."
"I'm no therapist (glad you're seeing one though!!) but I've found that for me, a helpful strategy for intrusive thoughts is to have some sort of label for them, rather than trying to get them to stop.

For instance, if one of those thoughts comes up, you could use the label on it of ""that's my trauma talking there, I know it's there and it looms up sometimes, but it doesn't control me.""

Somehow for me, this helps, having a label like that. Like, the thoughts aren't *me*, they're just the result of some experiences I've had, but they don't control me or have power over me."
"Having sex with your sister's best friend is one of those things that you just don't do. It's like your best friend hooking up with your ex. Don't do it. Unless all parties are in full agreement it's guaranteed to end really messy and friendships ruined. In OP's case, Mandy is in the wrong just as much as he is. "
"Through texting. We’re both super busy. I work full-time and she’s in an undergrad nursing program and a shit ton of extracurriculars. We send lots of funny Snapchats to each other during the day.

It can't always be on one person to plan date nights. It should alternate and ideally you have one per week. 
"I can't figure out how to post my own comment, only reply to another one, sorry new here..

But as someone who is currently trying to leave a verbally/emotionally/physically abusive partner right now my advice is to recognize this as wrong and get out early. I have been broken up with and then he has ""changed his mind"" 3 times in the past two days and even refused to let me leave. Do not move in together!!! It is NOT fun to be screamed at, to be told your partner hates you, to be told you do not love your partner, to be physically hurt and shoved and scared. If I could go back to the 5 month mark and end it then, as sad as that makes me... I probably would. I wish you the best of luck. "

"&gt; I feel like there is no such thing as a house without issues, but perhaps I am wrong.

You're not wrong, but issues in a house you love and issues in a house you hate are two very different things. One is ""I can work around it because I want to be here"" and one is ""I don't even want to live in this house in the best of circumstances, and now I have to live here *and* sink money/time into (problem)?!"""
"After reading the OP it doesn't sound like her SO is a loser. They may not be a good fit but it sounds like he is pulling his weight. 

""Whenever he helps with simple things like dishwashing he expects tremendous amounts of flattering and will actually flatters me unnecessarily if I do those.""

The last piece of this quote is telling, it sounds like he likes to give and receive verbal acknowledgement for household tasks. While this may not be a trait everyone likes, he isn't the deadbeat guy who does dishes and wants a parade. From what OP said at least in the beginning he gave OP the same acknowledgement as he wanted for helping out. That is different relationship styles not the SO being a loser.


""I have been open and clear about my finances all this time and he was criticising me that how on earth I ended up spending all my money although we are left with same net amount.""

""He also does not shop at all, so I ended up buying the stuff he needs like underwear, shampoo, cologne and what not. He pays all the bills and rent, but apparently nothing much else"" 


This is bad budgeting on OP's part if he is paying all of the static bills including Rent. Unless they spend an ungodly amount on groceries and clothing he is paying far more than OP for their household maintenance. It sounds like for all of OP's planning and budgeting he is doing a better job of it.


Also when it comes to his music and business ideas, from the post it doesn't sound like he ever asked OP to become involved. This one is just my guessing but he may not want her help on it. 
"
"He tells her no to everthing, except attending her recitals, paying some expenses and other things on a case-by-case basis. She still keeps asking.

I know that on the flip side it's better to have a SIL who wants me involved than shuns me away. So I'll keep that in mind. But I feel it's to the point of *imposition*. Her *constantly* asking for gifts/favours for her daughter is simply annoying, but it's her expectation that I view her daughter as my own daughter what makes me resentful. Some relationships are forced: ""Ok you are my new in-laws so I'm forced to have thanksgiving dinner with you"", but some relationships should be allowed to blossom on their own: ""Ok you are my in-laws, but as we've spent time together over the years I now view you as my surrogate parents"".

"That sounds like friendly banter imo, you're being overly sensitive to it. Your husband probably keeps doing it because he actually forgets it bothers you because they both see it as harmless joking. 

Me and my best friend in the entire world's fiance (they've been together for 8 years) joke like this constantly. We even gang up on her for funsies. She doesnt it take it weird cuz she knows my personality, like your friend bubbly, and it's all in good fun. I have no interest in him and he has none in me, we are simply very close friends. It would actually make me pretty annoyed of my bestie felt like upset for me getting along with her fiance. In fact, it's the complete opposite she LOVES that we're so close. 

Being mad at your husband cuz he jokes around w/ your friend is actually pretty childish. If you trust your husband and your best friend this seriously shouldn't bother you. 

Maybe if i misread how they're ""flirting"" you can explain how it crosses the line? "
"Wait, are you saying that she is bringing in outside food (a grey area) or is bringing in her own container and filling it with the movie theater's popcorn (unquestionably stealing)?

Put your foot down on the latter - this is theft and is an actual crime - and just agree to disagree on the former - the theater knows people do it and they don't much care.

I was from a poor family growing up and on the rare occasion we went to see movies, we always carried in outside food/drinks.  I bet half of the kids in the theater do it if you're not in a wealthy section of town.  But never in a million years would we have actually stolen/shoplifted anything from the theater."
He doesn't get to decide who you are friends with or to what extent.  
You're rationalizing very unhealthy behavior.
"thank you for your response. i know my mom has extremely valid points. you are right, there are so many negatives....i feel i have been taking a long step back for awhile now. i just got off the phone with him and i told him it is not ok for me to spend so much money on him and that i needed to take a step back and focus on myself."
"You're going to tank your own future if you keep up with this crap.  You're only 26 years old!  Why in the world are you worrying about taking care of a 35 year old prison rat and his 16 year old daughter.  You were 10 when she was born!  That's crazy.  She is in no way, shape, or form your responsibility, and frankly, neither is he.  Plus, this is showing you what he looks like as a deadbeat Dad.  He owes the state child support and is in prison, so he can't be there for his child.  What kind of future are you expecting with a guy like this other than one filled with pain, misery, and money problems.  There are plenty of decent men in the world who haven't spent a single night in jail, let alone YEARS.  

Get rid of the dead weight."
I think this is a bit unfair to her. She could’ve been unhappy for a long time and not said anything. I really feel for OP but I feel for fiancé too.
She is old enough to know exactly what she wants. She wanted a one night stand. That's it. Let it go. It's not a good look to persue someone who does not want to be persued. Hopefully she taught you a few things between the sheets that will benefit your next relationship. Onward and Upward.
"&gt; But he still wants to help. 

That is open to question. 

&gt; I think this is a good way of doing it. 

That, too, is open to question, and OP certainly has a right to have her feelings and privacy taken into account. "
"From her post, it’s not clear to me that he was a psycho when they last dated, or used to be abusive toward her. She said she didn’t hold a grudge but it could’ve been a rocky albeit relatively normal break-up, softened even more by the decade that’s gone by."

"I guess you are just going to have to grow up and stop acting like a 7 year old who thinks everything should be exactly fair.

No one here is going to be able to give you advice on how to stop being irrational other than to quash the thought ever time it comes up."
"Yes, most times its cause I hold resentment of things he's done. I think communication is key here. He's sleeping right now but when he wakes up I'm going to give him a big hug. I rarely ever do that anymore. Half the things wrote in here are exactly what I do to him down to the tee. He tries to kiss me I push away tell him to shave his beard etc... But she probably doesn't do half the things on purpose. It's become a pattern, this is life now. Plus she's probably resentful of unresolved issues for so long "
"You won't be alone, you'll have your friends and family to talk to (unlike what your girlfriend wants)"
"Even if YOU don't think it's ""petty"" many (most?) people will.

Also, regarding your daughter's age... she's 4 NOW... but anything you put on the internet has the potential to stick around indefinitely.  Even if she's shielded from what you do now... there's no telling when/if she'll stumble onto it when she's 10 or 12 or 18 etc."
"Well, in reality his situation is not desperate.  He is not in any danger.  He has shelter and food for the next 2.5 years.  The fact that he makes this situation sound ""desperate"" is a form of manipulation he's using to persuade you to keep sending him money. "
Clean Breakup. I'm glad you still have that choice. Run.
"&gt; But I'm still not okay with what she's asking me to do to appease her insecurities, and ultimately I feel like that's the bigger issue here

Yes, she's gone off the deepend and being unreasonable.  But the issue is a pattern of *behavior* on your end that has undermined her security in the relationship.  You are going to have to make changes to re-establish that trust, you have to *earn* it.

Relationships take work on both ends.  I feel like you are focusing on the symptoms (her ridiculous demands, controling behavior, and insecurity) instead of getting to the cause (your behavior that fosters a sense of insecurity in the relationship and your dismissal of her feelings).

I think your GF is out of line.  But I also think you are pretty dismissive of her and seem to absolve yourself from any part in getting to where you are today.    "
I think you are really looking to far ahead. Do you like this girl? Does she show interest in you? Maybe you should take some time to build self confidence before you look for any relationship.
"No its not innocent op. Let me ask you...how would your husband feel if one of your neighbors did the same thing to YOU? OR TO HIM?! I would imagine he would feel pretty violated, as would you, as would the neighbor, theres a reason he was ashamed and he should me."
Maybe he’s just being diplomatic &amp; doesn’t want them to think they’re going to a “second” wedding post-marriage.
probably someone who has to practice expressing them in mirrors their whole life in order to blend in with society
"That’s a you problem, not a her problem. She does it because she enjoys that time, that’s a good enough reason. I don’t see a good enough reason for you to make an issue out of it. You keep saying you want her to analyze herself but can’t figure out why it bothers you so much. Give it a rest, you sound exhausting if everyone has to justify their actions to your absolute satisfaction."
"She told you that because, she wants to know if you are going out on dates.  She wants you to know that she likes you enough to be exclusive.  You need to be honest with her.  If you want to date go a head, but when a girl mentions exclusivity to you, you have to find a way to let her know you don't want exclusivity.  If you do want that with this girl than don't go with the other girl.    She stopped going on dates to be exclusive with you, don't  hurt her.  If she is a 100% the type of girl you want date her exclusively.  Do not lie to either of the girls.  Think it through and make your decision.   You seem to like this girl a lot.  "
Why do you care what the rest of the world thinks?  You sound controlling AF. Let them do what they want. They're sisters FFS.
"Have to say - I would be so annoyed with his gf if I were a student at her school.  It's fine when people say ""this area is (allergen here) free"" - they can do that with desks and her own (preferably private) room.  But anything more than that?  Nah.  Her parents are trying to ban apples from the dining hall, AND from local grocery stores.

Apples are my favorite food - I would probably leave the school if I were told I couldn't have them, and I certainly wouldn't shop at a market that didn't supply them."
"Anti-depressants can screw with one's sleep-wake cycle. It's quite common to have to start sleep meds while on an anti-depressant. Smart doctors generally prescribe very, very mild sleep meds to start with.

Don't interfere with your girlfriend's medical business. Your comments about lacking ""the discipline"" and taking ""the shortcut"" suggest you have no idea what she's going through. Fyi, your statements are insultingly ignorant. If you don't want to get dumped for cause, don't talk to your girlfriend like this."
"&gt;  He just told me to leave 

That's probably the best response you're going to get out of this guy. He doesn't care to fix what is going on, he doesn't care about your happiness and comfort in the relationship and can't even put his jerk-off stuff away properly. Why do you want to be in this relationship?"
You don't have to stop what you're doing. OP's husband was deliberately staring at her in a dark room. Nobody is saying he should stop what he's doing and leave the room as soon as he catches a glance of skin. But I doubt very much that he was just innocently staring out his window on a dark night and the naked neighbor interrupted his quiet musing
"Yeah I don't see how ""sister of woman who died by suicide is sad"" is something beneficial for sharing a picture of for ""awareness."" Her boyfriend is stupid to think this is a good idea."
"Agreed, was just going to say the same thing."
"Since you already have a court order (your divorce settlement) stating that he has to pay $700, you are entitled to all the unpaid support up to this point... the missing $350/month x 48 months.  The court can make sure you get that as well, through extra wage garnishment, and taking his tax refunds.  And you probably won't need a lawyer to do it, especially if you are on Medicaid.  Look up child support enforcement services in your state, or if that isn't an option, just go to the courthouse and they can help you fill out the paperwork to file. "
Yeesss! This is about him and his pics and not his girlfriend's tragedy at all. It's so creepy
"He’s in no way controlling her. I don’t see anything wrong with telling her that there’s a good chance he will not be attracted to her should she get this tattoo. Personally, I would never date anyone with a face tattoo. If my SO decided to get one, yes that’s absolutely their choice, but it would be the end of the relationship. "
"Buddy, I'm sorry, but no she does not love you, not even as a friend. I've been there, and I thought the same, but she doesn't. If she loved you as a friend and still cared about your emotions, she wouldn't have cheated on you. If she cared about your feelings, she wouldn't have let you stay by her side while freaking out about being pregnant. She loves that you'll be her emotional pinata and let her use you over and over, but she doesn't love you or care about your feelings. Sorry man =/"
"Lol I watch a lot of Law &amp; Order so I did think that maybe her parents were exaggerating it. However, when I was thinking about it I would quickly dismiss it because I felt bad for even thinking that.

I'm wondering whether the school needed documentation for the dorm or maybe they just didn't want to take a chance and took their word? I'm thinking of how bad it might look if she had died and her parents went to the media saying they ignored her requests.

She was homeschooled all of her life so I thought that explained how she functioned before. I don't know, I do admit this thread has me a little suspicious but again maybe her case is rare?

This is a lot to deal with."
"""My therapist has actually told me that maybe this relationship isn't healthy because she'll start fights with me if I don't agree with her on certain issues and then she'll break up with me and then apologize."" Yeah, don't stick around for this sort of behaviour (allergy or not).

Please end it now. You will be miserable with her, she'll depend more and more on you, you'll likely see your friends less etc. You don't need this--move on."
"Just tell them that you can’t afford to spend that extra $800 a month. They can’t argue with that. Just tell your girlfriend knows that it’s not about her, it’s about the money"
"&gt;I understand that she may not like it, may not be her style, or any other reason. It still bothers me that it still sits in the box.

So you want her to wear something she doesn't like? AND she's not even a jewelry wearer? Nah bro. She's not in the wrong here."
Look at her post history. It's not the only reason why they hate her.
"I feel like if you don't want the date to work out with Becca, you already have your answer.... don't use her to make you feel better about your feelings for Sarah. that's just selfish and cruel. Becca is a person too. 

I would tell her you met someone but hope to remain friends, tell Sarah about it, and be friendly and not flirty with Becca. "
"You made this thread looking for ammo to use against her.  Instead of simply dealing with your own issues, you are dumping it on her instead.  You want rationalizations for something that is obviously beyond that for them.  
  The short and sweet of it is that's how they grew up.  For whatever reason.  Try accepting it first, then look for reasons.  The results might ultimately be more positive then. "
"Yes, we are very Christian, and a lot of us were in the military at some point. 

His father was from Estonia. Not sure what it is like there.

I can try to tell him we'd like to see him more often. I don't think anyone will know she is from there unless they bring it up. But I know he is very worried about it. He has always been very protective of his foreign friends and mostly associates with foreigners."

"She said that after I basically pressed her about it and guilted her. Either way, I couldn't wait for my wife to get off of work. Nor would I have wanted her there considering she has been rude and talked terribly of alicia in the past. "
"I feel there needs to be more to the story. Playing video games for 6 to 12 hours every day is crazy. Is she unemployed? Does she ever go out? It does appear like she's addicted, which if you ask me is the bigger problem. People who are depressed or experience other problems often use video games as an escape from reality.

It sounds like she has low self-esteem and enjoys the attention she receives from all the guys online. She also gets her social interactions from all the little groups she meets on there. She may be acting inappropriately, but you can't expect more from someone who has all these issues going on.

It's unlikely that you can change any of this. What you need to do is ask yourself the following questions. Why are you with someone who doesn't do anything but play video games all day? What does she contribute to the relationship? Does she love you enough to make changes to her life and seek professional help if you tell her that this might end your relationship? If the answers to these questions are bad - why are you staying with her and enduring all of this?"
The age difference should bother *you*. 
Normal. Change sucks.  Change is awesome. It’s okay. You’ll get through it.
"Don't date game-playing, manipulative, controlling assholes.

Do you really respect this woman? Because she doesn't think you do, and I don't actually blame her for not believing any more than I'd blame you for not respecting her. She sounds toxic. This whole novel is nothing but a list of things she feels entitled to ""punish"" you for. Watching later episodes of Family Guy is worth getting huffy and glare-y about? Pitiful. 

There is a compatibility issue here with the beliefs she has about animal ethics that you don't share. If there was nothing else to this story I'd advise someone to leave with their partner if their partner is that uncomfortable. However, there is also the issue that your girlfriend is seriously lacking in ""people ethics"", blames her own shitty judgements on others, and generally game-plays in childish ways. It's not making you a better person to continue to be around this. This messed up dynamic is screwing with your judgement as well and you're 'fighting to win' or 'giving in' rather than actually address conflict or disagreements. Go be better with someone better."
"But seriously, mom is a sexual predator. If he ever whispers about having your future children around her, run screaming."

"Date. Go out with other people. He lost out on you, not the other way around. I think you put a lot of emotion into a non-existent relationship and need to focus your emotions and energy to something positive like work, hobbies, other friends, other romantic interests, etc... When you're in your friends group focus on the game and the other friends, be polite but you don't owe him anything more than that."
"Call her bluff. Let her cry but don't back down or comfort her.

Then sign up for couples therapy, it's excellent for helping people argue/discuss/disagree in a healthy and produtcive way, not this BS"
Lmao do you realize how many dad's fit that scenario? There's nothing identifying about it because its so vague 
"Ok this used to be my job getting people to apply for social security when they were resistant about it and honestly your family is going about in classic harmful and stigmatising ways that are just making it a stand off. I worked in a community mental health team dealing exclusively with people with severe enduring mental health needs, primarily schizophrenia but also schizo affective disorder and bipolar. Most of our clients were low income and PoC and often had come through the system in crisis having had forced hospitalisations, sectioning and police intervention.

You are treating your brother as a problem to be fixed not a person with needs and fears and the more you push to take control away from him, the more the whole thing will escalate. His behaviour is of course challenging but 90% of what you describe (in fairly disdainful terms) are the literal symptoms of his illness. Even the heavy cigarette use is a symptom of both schizophrenia and the meds used to treat it.

I don't doubt that living with this is frustrating AF but have you ever tried to understand what it's like to be your brother? Developing an illness like this is traumatising in the first place and things like having control of meds or hospital admissions can cause PTSD on top. You simply can't react like a non mentally ill person to that stuff.

Has anyone sat down and asked him how he feels about things? The rapid weight gain in schizophrenia is often described by clients as like being invaded or violated (the average gain is sixty pounds solely from the meds) and it often contributes to the feeling that their delusions are real because it can seem like a physical manifestation of what's in their head.

There is also an enormous amount of shame for younger people who are supposed to be at the prime of their life not to be economically productive and unbelievable stigma about claiming social security. Has anyone talked to him about that or the grief and loss of developing a debilitating illness?

In my job, we talked to clients about what social security involved including countering myths about the assessment procedure and giving advice on how to navigate it (and btw it's fucking brutal. We had clients made to describe trying to kill themselves and ending up so ill they were hospitalised. It's not just submitting a form and donesies.) We talked to them about fears about how being 'dependent' felt and we addressed their trauma and we listened to them.

Around 90% took up social security and in trusting that arm of government and 'help' their medication uptake increased and they were more likely to take up training or day care or support systems. Some of these men (and most were men) had been so shamed and traumatised and disempowered for years with their illness that they were like trapped animals biting at everyone.

We did not tolerate abuse and we put strict rules in place and upheld consequences but we listened and were fair about punishment rather than punitive because often these men had been punished for simply being ill. We had a massive recidivism drop, a rise in employment and issues between patient and care staff improved hugely. 

Most of the families involved learned how to cope better, had a better understanding of symptoms, set better boundaries and were able to look at how their behaviour might also be triggering clients instead of the traditional aspect of blaming the 'sick' person for all the faults in the family. We encouraged families to seek support and arm themselves with coping strategies too and often used other community members as mediators when both sides needed to be heard. 

We imposed consequences for families too who often threatened sectioning and forced treatment when someone didn't behave the way they considered the right way. And we also encourage families to estrange themselves when there was abusive behaviour (and the same for clients.)

It was a trauma focused project looking at mental illness as what happened to you rather than being your identity and it went on to win national awards and be used as model across the UK. Ironically we had our government funding scrapped and I lost my job because they were furious that we got so many people claiming benefits at a time they were trying to get people off them.

So TL:DR: set consequences for abusive behaviour but otherwise stop trying to impose control and do more listening and understanding of your brother's situation. Let him be heard instead of turned into the identified patient. Arm yourself with boundaries but learn more about schizophrenia and look at how the family reacts to this. Changing the angle you approach it from is vital."
"I'm on year 7 of my current relationship with my partner. When we first met however, we experienced a similar problem. I was into ""ruff stuff"" to put it nicely and he a nervous vanilla boy. Sex was put off for a while and as for getting into it? Nope. No way. Full brakes.

In my situation the process kind of went like ""I love you, I can't hit you"" to ""I guess we can try X...?"" to ""are you sure that was ok? I guess we can try it again then"" to one day, many months later, ""when are we gonna do x again?"" 

First advice I can offer is don't expect him to go full throttle at the beginning of this. It's not something he's used to or necessarily even likes. It's gonna take time to build up to higher levels of stuff. Try something more ""normal"" with him and when he's comfortable with that try to get him to take the next step. Start with one thing at a time, it will be a lot less overwhelming 

Second, a lot of people are nervous about hurting or harming people they care about, you're going to have to convince him that it's really ok. And that you really do like it. It might kill the mood for that day, but you can always give him tutorials, scripts, lessons (what have you) to help him learn how you like to be treated. Teach him how to hit you, how hard and how much. He's probably nervous about going to hard or too far with you. 

Do these things in casual, relaxed settings, try to normalize it for him. Once hes learned and once hes had time to adjust - then you can start putting them together and get more into scenes/roleplay elements.  Trying to get right into that stuff is like going from 0 to 1,000 it won't feel natural for him. 

It was some work for sure and I definitely got frustrated sometimes. But after everything we have some killer kinky sex now and we've come a long way from the boy who was too nervous to leave hickeys. 

If this is someone you care about and want to pursue a long term relationship with, I definitely say it's worth the effort to compromise and take your time with this stuff. There's always porn and toys to help ease your frustration. But good guys are a lot harder to find

Edit: stupid autocorrect "
"Bit harsh. I know reddit *loves* to crucify cheaters, and anyone who enables it, but:

&gt;didn't even care enough about you to tell you your ex was cheating on you for months

The reason they didn't tell him is likely that it's an incredibly delicate and difficult decision, not because they ""didn't care"". It's a lose-lose situation. If they don't tell him, people on the internet will be yelling about how they're the scum of the earth. If they *do* tell him, he might not believe them and it would ruin their friendship. Or he *will* believe them, but shoot the messenger. Basically any possible outcome is BAD. Telling him is the right thing, but I don't blame a bunch of college kids not having the wherewithal to make that decision, especially given that they were friends with both of them.

They cared enough about him to reach out, again and again and *again* for YEARS. That's not the actions of someone who ""doesn't care"".

&gt;maintained a long-standing friendship with her

They're facebook friends. For all you or OP know, they haven't spoken to her in years.

For what it's worth I don't think OP should meet up with them, simply because there really isn't anything to gain from it. But I think painting them as some kind of awful, abusive supervillains is also hyperbolic."
"I don't want to sound pessimistic, but you should get a recent picture of your mother when you will go to the maternity, and ask them to block her if she comes. 

Same about refusing her access to your home. Be ready to call the police if she comes.

"Well, I was almost with dude. I have basically done exactly this to a girl before. 

Definitely a stupid thing to do, but his reaction makes this a no-go in my opinion. In my case I’m pretty sure I actually cried because she was crying and I was that upset. She was out in the cold for an hour and a half before I woke up and checked my phone. I felt like the worst person ever and apologized profusely. I can’t imagine telling someone to go fucking die in that scenario (or any scenario seriously what the fuck) 

Forget this jerk "

Good job on 2 years! That's awesome 
That sounds like CLASSIC anxiety.
"It sounds like your wife holds onto her negative emotions and does not have an adequate way to release them. You seem to be trying your best by listening to her and validating the feelings, but it seems like she needs more.

It sounds like she doesn't feel that you really understand her, and there are some possibilities as to why she feels that way: 

-	**You may actually be sympathising instead of empathising.** Empathising is being able to connect to the feelings, not the situation. It comes with a lack of judgement on your part, lack of any intention to fix the problem, and lack of the expectation that you will make her feel better. The outcome *may* be that she does feel better afterwards, but effectively empathising focuses on the other person expressing their thoughts end emotions. To work on improving your empathising skills, I can give you some things to read and watch if you are interested.
-	**She is not expressing the heart of her ""pain"".** While she may be talking about how (for example) someone frustrated her, she may not mention that she internalized that feeling and the real frustration is actually with herself. So you may be listening to her vent, but there could be an underlying pain that she is not able to express and thus, she is not able to release it. To handle this, it takes careful prying with open ended questions and responses that lack any judgement. ""It sounds like this woman frustrated you. What about her actions are you unhappy with? How did you feel when she did that? How do you feel about yourself right now?"" Asking questions like this is also an effective way to show that you empathize. Interestingly, questions that start with ""Why..."" are discouraged because they can come off as judgemental or advice giving. ""Why are you mad about Y?"" implies that you think she shouldn't be mad about Y and she should get over Y. ""Why don't you do X?"" is implying she should do X, but she may think you aren't hearing her and you are focused instead on fixing her

After all this, it's possible that you don't want to play this role for her because it can be difficult and take a lot out of you. That's completely understandable. You are only human and have an understanding of your own limitations. If this is the case, then a therapist would probably help fill that role.

I feel that humans are pretty complex but we definitely don't like pain and feeling alone in that pain. Keeping pent up negative emotions without proper release can be detrimental to mental health and can in turn affect physical health as well, so finding an outlet is pretty important for self-care"
"I tend to get bored out of my mind at work, when walking and at some other times.

"Exactly -- she's saying that ""yellow fever"" is attraction based on gross racial stereotypes.

He'll hopefully get tired of it before something goes really wrong.

Agreed. 
"This is a red flag. I don't mean to alarm you but there have been other stories on this sub where the new SO actively destroyed the deceased SO's belongings. So, while I hope this turns out to be a completely unnecessary precaution, I would first advise you to make sure that box of your late wife's belongings is safe.

It is normal for the new SO to have feelings of inadequacy or insecurity regarding the deceased SO. But demanding that your partner obliterate all remnants of the deceased SO from their life is not a healthy way of handling those feelings. You need to draw a firm line with her, and also give some thought to whether this is a one-off thing she is struggling with or if she is jealous and controlling in other areas of your relationship. My feeling reading your post is that this will not be the only thing you find her to be unreasonable about. "

"&gt; Your wife is sleep deprived out of her mind right now. She really, honestly and truly, does not have the energy to do more than what she's already doing, and she's not a rational person right now because your brain stops working when you don't sleep right.

Which may be true, but shes also take free days off to hang out with her friends and to hang out on the computer while OP and her mom care for the baby. When she has time to rest or sleep in, she chooses not to then throws it on OP when he says he cant keep up (while not asking her to do more work).

&gt; she accuses me of not wanting to be an involved father and reminds me that my days of video games and hanging out with my friends are over for at least a few years. Totally depressing when she's seen her friends without the baby at least once a month since our son was born.

She has a clear double standard and sleep doesnt seem to be part of it. "
"Girl stop!!! No! This is no way, shape or form your fault! This is all him! He hit you, he only apologised and admitted he was wrong because he was tired of you bringing it up, he's having an emotional affair with another women and completely degrading you to her! Get the hell out of there girl, he is awful and you deserve so much more "
"I can sympathize with OP a bit.  My husband was just on a two week international trip with his family.  I chose not to go for various reasons.  During the time he was away, we were dealing with some stressful home issues on our end.  No where near as stressful as yours having to close on a house and deal with bedbugs (I've had them in the past, and they are a living hell to deal with).  We had some escalating issues with our upstairs neighbor and our landlord refused to respond to emails/phone calls.  I was very stressed.  

Others may not agree, but while I did sympathize with his desire to unplug and not deal with daily life issues, I was still in the thick of it.  I tried not to bring up the issue when we talked (we actually only messaged as with time difference we were barely awake at the same time), but I also didn't feel like he should be 100% spared the reality I was dealing with. I needed some feedback as to which steps to take because when he returns he would be affected by my decisions had I chosen to completely keep him out of the loop.  

During his trip, he did kindly ask me to keep the ""venting"" to a minimum. I complied.  We also overwhelmingly talked about his trip. I asked tons of questions and was genuinely happy and interested in what he did everyday. But to everyone stating that you would have been wrong to share the stress you were dealing with, I disagree.  

The part about your BF communicating infrequently would have annoyed me as well.  However, if it wasn't discussed beforehand, it's hard to hold that against him.  It's worth discussing that for future trips or time apart.  I am also in the camp where I would consider a simple text telling me he arrived would be considered correct and considerate and an e-mail or picture every so often would be appreciated, but not everyone functions that way.  Hopefully next time both your expectations will be a little clearer from the start."
Your reaction is different than mine. I would be pissed if my boyfriend had gotten involved in this situation.  I’m a fan of ignoring assholes.  You don’t know if this crazy person has a gun or knife or whatever.  I don’t want myself or my boyfriend getting hurt because we encountered a crazy person.  IMO it’s not worth it.  I have a friend who was stabbed (fortunately he’s okay) because he started telling off a crazy guy for catcalling his gf.
"If someone who was across the street was more willing to defend you than your boyfriend who was right next to you then that says a lot. You weren't asking him to knock him out but he could have at least tried to diffuse the situation  a little bit rather than watch some idiot yell racial slurs at you.

Also, his decision to befriend his ex who was clearly encouraging him to cheat says a lot about him too.

I think you can do better. "
"Yes I get the same brain zaps and withdrawal headaches when I don't take my antidepressants. If a boyfriend wanted me to stop taking them I'd tell him to kick rocks. I need this medication in order to not feel sick and horrible. OP, you have serious issues. "
One thing I can say I’ve resolved to do is if my family asks me why I’m moving I can tell them exactly why and how she’s treated and talked about me all these years. My family probably partially already knows but at least I can finally be honest with them instead of saying everything’s fine
Slow down. You felt your wife was the one after roughly the same length of time. Work things out with your wife or leave but don’t make the same mistake twice; learn.
"It’s totally fine to be turned on by whatever. But you involved your friend in a “kink” that is a real-life situation for her that she’s probably actually faced. Not necessarily actual rape, but comments like that... which are scary and demeaning. I can’t believe you thought it would be funny to tell her about it. That’s just next-level insensitive. If you’re going to involve your friends in your fetishes without their consent... and co-opt part of their identity for your own sexual gratification... at least have the common sense and decency to lie about it."
"She was your gf at 12?

I really feel for you but the reality is that at 22 she’s just starting to develop mature ideas about what she wants for her future...  she won’t sort out those thoughts for a few years yet but the fairy tail you dream of is probably not going to happen.

This is sad but it’s a part of life’s learning experiences.

It might be hard to imagine at the moment but good times lay ahead for you...  and you’ll have fond memories of your time with this girl too.

Something that’s really important - be sure to take care of yourself after the breakup...  too many men struggle to find their way after big changes like this."
"&gt;. I just personally feel like if he broke something of mine on accident I wouldn't act the way he does and just be like ""accidents happen it's ok""

He's not you."
"Prior to this, he has been very supportive. Which is why this whole thing kind of caught me off guard. "
"I mean, he's not wrong, but most guys grow out of it by the time they hit school age. I work in daycare, loads of little boys like to play with themselves but are easily deterred by a simple cue of 'do you have to go to the bathroom?', and sending them to wash their hands every time you catch them with their hands down their pants. If a three year old can do it, this dude has issues."
"He's holding you hostage.  You can't move forward because he won't let you.  However, the choice is yours.  If you keep on supporting him, he has no reason to change.  If all the family members aren't on the same page, it's going to be very hard to make a change.  If you feel able and willing to keep on supporting him as the years go by, then things will stay as is.  Only if you really feel you want a change in your life of your family can you make a change in his life.  If you stop his cigarettes, will he be violent so you can call the police?  You need help and counselling for you and your family.  "
"I agree with everyone here but I also want to say I feel really bad for your SIL. He's probably struggling with your dad's death too if they were that close and it has to suck to have your dad's special last ""gift"" to him be tainted by a childish, jealous in-law while he's trying to deal with his death. I hope your brother gets his head out of his butt too, he's making an already hard situation worse for no reason and making the whole family stress out during an already stressful time."
"“If he is allowing her to go, clearly he thinks she's responsible enough to do so.”

I’ve always thought that kind of logic is bullshit. We both live with the same people. We both see them in different lights. Siblings should very well be allowed to voice their opinions when it comes to the capabilities of their brother or sister. Sure in the end it's the dad's decision but don't use that reason to justify anything."
"There's nothing to work out.  

She doesn't trust you and was ready to believe the absolute worst of you at the slightest provocation.  She doesn't even respect you enough to have an adult conversation and allow you to explain the situation - you had to force her to listen.   If she'd even bothered to think about the conclusion that she'd jumped to, she'd have realized just how little sense it made... *that you would bring home and take advantage of a girl who is so blackout drunk that she couldn't possibly give consent, at the exact place and time where you were meant to meet up with your girlfriend, and leave her hanging out on the porch while you went for a walk?*

After 1.5 years, you deserve better than this.

"OP, this is the answer you need to hear.

This girl does NOT have feelings for you. You are her safety school. The guy that will always be there. The support she will always have when the guys she really wants to date get away.

Feel free to talk to her about your feelings if you want. But be prepared for her to say something about not messing up your friendship, or about how you're roommates, etc. It's all BS. "
"The good things she had to say about him had to do with his ability to provide, not him as a person. It's quite clear she thinks he's very dull and doesn't actually enjoy spending time with him that much compared to her ex. It's fine if she's fine with it, but I don't know why OP expects others to not see it for what it is: that she's still in love with her ex, and is settling. "
"I think you need to figure out why you want these questions answered for yourself.

When I see an actor in a movie I can’t name, I get the same urge to find out who it is on IMDB, and go through that rabbit hole, but I’ve never wanted to know how much they make. It’s unimportant to me. 

What gain do you get from knowing everything about your ex’s friends and family? 

And moreover, if your boyfriend knows you snoop so much, how did he find out? Did it come up in conversation or did you talk about the info without prompting? "
No I wouldn’t if it was a female friend with my fiancé. I would feel uncomfortable because once in a relationship I guess I just expect that my girl won’t be sleeping with another man. I don’t care if she has male friends but sleeping with them... seriously?  You don’t see an issue with that?  It puts the person on a situation where things can easily happen. Why leave the door for temptation wide open?

All that matters os respecting boundaries when it's not a significant detriment to you and you've said a dozen times you didn't push the bed sharing thing... Sorry people don't understand that people can have different boundaries. Personally, I do feel that the discomfort is at its core around ""what if they have sex..."" in a vague way, but people don't want to admit it so they just act like it's some natural law instead. "

I don't know what he's saying, but, come on. JK is not a free pass to be a butthole."
"I feel so, so sorry for your mom, that she had to kill someone to defend herself, that she had to live with an abusive partner, and that she now has a child like you who won't be on her side after this traumatic experience. You think this is bad for you? Imagine what she's going through.

You need therapy and you need to shatter your childish illusions of your father. Someone who is good to you but abusive to someone else is still a bad person."
"OP, listen to this. Therapy is really the only answer here. Don't feel guilty about having these feelings, this is a complicated situation and your feelings about it are complicated too. You're grieving the loss of your father and you're allowed to grieve, just please try therapy. This one is way above reddit's paygrade. "
"I feel for you, I really do. You've learned that you never really had the father that you thought you did and lost him in such a short space of time.


But, honestly, I feel more for your mum. She lived through abuse and violence, and took it in silence to protect her kids. And because she did, because she shielded her children from the worst, they are turning their backs on her when she needs them the most. What a horrible irony, that her suffering is perpetuated by the love she gave her children. 


How dare they be angry with her? When she was fighting for her life, her survival, would they have preferred that she lay down and die, to protect their blinkered view of their family? Would they have rather that your father killed her instead? 


My abusive uncle murdered my aunt. Their children found them (he ""attempted"" suicide after, but survived). A few years on, and one of their children took his own life. Believe me when I say that I have seen the alternative to fighting back. 


Please. Go to her. Get therapy, work through your undeniably complex emotions. But go to your mum. You need eachother. "
Abused women are more likely to get killed while leaving or after they've left.
"This man will rape and possibly kill you. You need to move into another room and get a restraining order on him. Speak to the school officials about getting him banned from the student housing. If your friend doesn't like it or believe you, she was never your friend.

"okay, here's what you do. You sit him down, and you say, ""I feel that when we spend time together with Son, you come across as sarcastic and mean-spirited. I don't feel like you have this attitude when you are just with me. It hurts my feelings when you are sarcastic to Son and I believe it hurts his feelings too.

I would like to spend time together as a family more cheerfully. Can we please discuss what might be leading to this problem?""

And you see how he reacts. Is he wiling to discuss it? Does he deny it? Is he defensive and try to turn blame back on you.

You stay calm and firm. It's a pattern you have observed and you would like to know if there's a reason for it and what can be done so the situation can improve.

If he cannot discuss it, or the situation does not improve, you suggest couples counseling since you cannot and will allow someone to be cruel to your child.

If he will not go to couples counseling and make a genuine effort, and is still mean and sarcastic to your child, then you leave him. "

I locked myself in and started scrubbing out the tub, even with my friends banging on the door to see if I was okay.  I find that people who turn into raging assholes when they're drunk are usually raging assholes when they're sober, even if it's hidden deep down.  All the people that I know that have good hearts usually let it show even when they're shitfaced.  "
"Thank god for the scholarships. If they are covering all or at least the bulk of your costs - stockpile what you can in your account. Sign up for classes online(call the school's admissions office and let them know the letter was accidentally destroyed so you will need help getting yourself set up). GTFO.

I am sorry your father has turned ou to be a massive choad. I really am. unfortunately it may be some time before he changes if at all.

Trying to stop you from leaving(he can't stop you) isn't going to make you straight. It will however ensure you hate and resent him. 

Also - when you leave take as much as you can - laptop clothes anything of real value to you etc."
"dogs are property in US law too, but knowingly trying to damage someone's property is illegal. animal cruelty is illegal too (though whether it would meet the standard for that charge would depend on the state i imagine). 

so yeah, pretty much every facet of this is not only morally disgusting but also very much illegal. that girl better be thanking her lucky stars that she didn't come out of this missing teeth or catching a charge."
"&gt; She has definitely already expressed that she doesn't want our son's life to change if he were to have a sibling, but we're both only children (functionally, she has a much older half sister) so I'm not sure how possible/impossible that is.

Completely and utterly impossible. She is living in a fantasy land. Hopefully some of this will sink in after more time under your belts with one, but it absurd to think a child's life will not be impacted by the addition of another baby. Everything will change.  "
"I think a better way to look at this is to remember that the *actually* ""gracious"" (aka polite and decent) way to reject someone is just, ""No, I'm not interested."" And that is all women owe a guy they don't like. 

I think the ""gracious"" response SqueakyBall is referring to when they say women don't owe such a response to men is the ego-flattering, make-sure-he-doesn't-feel-rejected soft no that women often feel they have to give. Things like ""I'm so flattered, but I have a boyfriend"" or ""That's really sweet, but I'm just sooo busy."" Rejection that doesn't hurt a guy's feelings or pride, basically. 

If OP's sister told the kid no, and then subsequently ignored him, (which further comments from the OP seem to suggest), then the sister did everything actual courtesy demands. OP's fiance (and his little brother) seem to want the sister to assuage the kid's ego or enable his fantasy, even though she's not interested and doesn't owe anyone that emotional labor. "
"When I was 16 I was rarely home when my parents were home. I was there *constantly* when I knew they wouldn't be home, specifically to be alone with my boyfriend. My parents didn't allow boys in the house when they weren't home, so I would lie and say I was out with friends. "
"I breastfed exclusively for 15 months.  It is extremely exhausting and tedious.  I also agree that's its unfair for her not to want hired help and pre-made dog food.

Try to see if she will agree to a trial week or two with the help of the walker and dog food.  Then maybe she'll see how it eases the stress on you.
Her mother can for sure help a little bit with housework.  That's Bullshit for her to say that it's her contribution for her mom to watch the baby.  I don't know what to tell you about that. "

No. You saw a pretty girl. Now get back to work and call your girlfriend and tell her you love her. 
"She's checked out.

Went through almost the same thing as you. Married 12 years, had a kid, bought a house, killing myself in progressively higher paying but also higher stress jobs.

She was a SAHM, but didnt do jack while I worked 60 hours a week. House always messy, my then-toddler constantly thrown in front of the TV while she looks for affair partners on the computer. Never cooks, never does laundry, no sex or affection.

Wasn't even worth saving at the end, she later admitted she never loved me a single day during those 12 years and only married me to get away from her family.

I hate to say usually when she's THAT checked out, shes either cheating or so far gone that any attempt to fix it will be futile."
"That was my reaction too. Sneaking off to a child bedroom would never be an appropriate behavior, specially with people you barely know. The fact that she is a woman should not downplay that behavior. "
"I live in New Zealand, so I understand the difference between how Americans see Islam and Muslims, vs. how we see you.

As someone with Muslim friends, let me say that not all communities are the same. One of my friends was sent to Egypt at age 12 for texting a boy, had to beg to be returned home (as she was engaged to her 30 y/o cousin), and suffered from her father's abuse for years. He is part of a mosque where women submit to their husbands and barely exist outside of their families. All of the women are forced to wear headscarves, rape victims only have themselves to blame, FGM is ideal (though fortunately rare). You get the idea.

Alternatively, my other friend is in a normal relationship with her second serious boyfriend, went to university, has a full-time job, is on birth control, and chooses not to wear a headscarf, while her mother chooses to. She is a lovely, gentle, caring woman who, while having some hiccups related to Islam, has a healthy relationship with her religion. She attends a more liberal mosque, where they set up fund-raisers and charities for the hungry, pray in peace, and preach about love.

I hope you get more information from actual Muslims, but as an outsider, I think it really depends on the community. Some are straight-up misogynistic cults, some are problematic but fine, and some are places of love and support and liberation.

Get a divorce. You know you need to do it. This lifestyle isn't sustainable. But then branch out, see what else your faith has to offer you, see if there are mosques with charity affiliations where you can volunteer and help others. Maybe also see a (non-religious) therapist who can help you separate the idea of abuse and Islam being synonymous."

"This would make me so insecure that I don't think I could ever come back from it. If you can, that's amazing. But its also okay if you just can't. 

It was wrong of him to not communicate and essentially cheat (yes, it was still cheating) instead."
"Of course you don’t ‘have to’. But you can. It’s okay to get angry, it’s okay to express it healthily. OP isn’t artificially trying to get angry here - he is angry, and he can and should say to his wife, ‘I am upset because of x’"
"I am just a stranger on the internet without kids but breaking up might be the best thing here. It is unfair to your future kids to have them grow up with a father who doesn't want them and it's unfair to your wife to keep her from having children while she really wants them. 

Sadly having kids is a black and white situation, you either have them or you don't. You can't compromise."
"Have you considered you guys might be bad for each other? I say that as someone who has had to admit that to myself about someone I loved completely. It seems neither of you are a bad person alone. 

 
There are 2 scenarios that make sense here...

A. You're a no-bullshit kind of person who is being manipulated by someone who is squeamish about dealing with anything...unpleasant. He seems to think that he can control you by showing how frightening you are. There is no need for this as you are putting in maximum effort to be ""chill"" so of course it pisses you off. It would make anyone angry, you're adamant that this time you're not to blame, you're not a tyrant and fuck him for not being able to handle any negative emotions. Emotions aren't always positive. He does everything he can to make you sorry for the things you've apologized for and it has escalated to the point he's triggered by a mouse fart. He is even wasting EMS time for his charade, wasting money to punish you for everything he said he ""forgave"". 

B. He's not a sniveling coward, he is a man abused. The proverbial hen-pecked pansy on the outside but on the inside he's pissing himself because you are terrifyingly oblivious to the fact that you're a monster. He feels like he's finally taking back his voice and he's doing that by letting you see the broken shell of a man he's become by loving his abuser. 

In reality, it doesn't matter who is right, you're toxic to each other so you're both probably somewhat right. You need to at least seperate and work through your own bullshit before attempting to stop this train wreck. Not trying to be harsh but you can't simultaneously refuse to tolerate bullshit from others and at the same time ignore your own flaws. That's asinine and you seem intelligent enough to see that. 

IMO, you're not a ""chill"" person, you're straightforward and if you have an unpleasant task ahead you don't whine about it, you do it. Those are actually some great qualities to have. However, due to those qualities you are not going to be happy with someone who gets triggered easily by anything. You're partner is going to need to be someone you trust and respect completely. Can you really say trust and respect are what you have with your current partner? "
Don't worry about what she's doing. It's not your responsibility. You are not her keeper.

Your boyfriend is a coward. He should have said, ""Dude, knock it off. No need to insult all women because any your bar hook ups didn't result in a relationship.""

What you do is, spend time and hang out with other members of the group so they get to know you. Over time, if Mark makes more insulting comments they'll back you up if you say, ""What do you mean by that? BF and I met at a bar."" Talk to them in passing about Mark's attitude as well, and they may shut him down independently."

Again, she knows what she's doing is completely inappropriate and she's messing with you.

I would tell her that she needs to have clothes (or at least a robe) on when she's in the shared spaces when you're home. She can be nude in the privacy of her own bedroom. If she wants to be nude all the time, she needs to be up front about that when seeking a roommate or get a place of her own.

As for hanging nude in shared spaces, is she at least putting a towel down to avoid leaving a snail trail, or...? "

It's pretty hard to cherry pick anything really that doesn't come back to the basics.  I highly doubt that OPs bf  doesn't subscribe to any of these and has no previous knowledge of any of these."

"&gt; Honestly I'm a little conflicted about the whole thing because I'm attracted to him no matter what. 

He's attracted to you as a person, but that person doesn't seem to exist any more. This is what he's feeling like now. It's easy for you say that you're attracted to him ""no matter what,"" because by your own admission, he's the only one who's actually putting effort into his life.

I say all of this, even though you wrote ""I know not everyone is the same,"" because relationships are a two way street. Each party has to get something out of it to make it a worthwhile venture. What does your boyfriend get out of this relationship? He sounds like he has a roommate and not a girlfriend. You say ""how much is enough?"" How much is enough for what? To keep your boyfriend content with your existence? That's not exactly the gold standard for a relationship, especially one of a few years length."
"Tell her!

My grandmother is 80. She found out a few years ago that her mother had a baby out of wedlock about 20 years before she was born? The baby was adopted out, and her mother never said anything. My grandmother found out when her aunt was on her deathbed.

My grandmother would love to have known that sister and family, but we've tried searching and have had no luck finding the sister or any family the may have had. I think it's one of my grandmother biggest regrets, not being able to know."

"This reminds me another post. A girl was complaining bc her bf was jealous she was hanging out with another guy (her coworker). She lost her ""special friend/ work husband"" and her bf.


OP the fact you never invited your wife to hang out with your ""friend"" is suspicious. Is Julia married? Has your wife ever hung out with Julia one on one? Any sexual past or attraction between you two? 


AND JEEZ you're going to celebrate your birthday with another woman?! You didn't even try to find a babysitter so you can go on this trip with your own WIFE. If you could choose between losing Julia or your wife(we don't know her name bc it's not important, i guess.) Who would you pick? "

"It’s not really about your friend being poly - it’s about her over sharing, being obsessed with talking about her sex life, and helping people cheat on their partners.  You can tell her you don’t want to hear about those things, but if I were you, I’d just find a new friend.  And this is coming from someone in an open relationship - I don’t talk about my hookups with friends, and find it strange when people do talk a lot about that sort of thing. "
"i don't really have any advice other than you should probably stop using the term ""friendzone."" please consider that beautiful women will very possibly want to be strictly a platonic friend to you throughout your life, and to basically put them into the binary categories of ""hot woman/potential girlfriend who is willing to fuck me"" or ""hot woman who won't fuck me and is therefore 'friendzoning' me"" is a really ridiculous, gross thing to do. 

if you are interested in her romantically, just straight up ask her if she feels the same way. don't continue to be nice to her simply because you hope to eventually date her; be nice for the sake of being nice. she might have no idea that you are interested in pursuing a relationship with her, so any effort you put towards wooing her (flirting, taking her out for dinner, hugging, being emotionally vulnerable, etc.) can be misconstrued as being friendly or lighthearted, especially if she is a friendly and lighthearted person. 

the best way to avoid uncertainty about someone's feelings about you is to just ask!!"
"Sit him down and tell him that he's sending you back down that path. Tell him that you'll have to leave him for your own health. 

If he doesn't react, go stay at a friend's or a hotel for a few days. Since he's so dependent on you for this, maybe just putting some space between you two will put the situation in to perspective for him again, and he'll have to be in charge of his own diet for a while?  

"
"All of the reasons listed here for this relationship failing are put onto her. I’m not saying they’re not true, but there’s likely a reason she feels this way and you’re likely to be complicit in at least some of it, even if you’re not aware. Maybe more counselling would open all of this up? 

The entire relationship failing can’t all be on her, surely? It doesn’t usually work that way. "
"I'm going to say no these are all average friendly behaviors. I would also cringe really hard if a guy sent me a text saying ""he enjoyed our chemistry"".  Also stop asking about this girl a million times on reddit, you're obsessing. Live your life and learn from your mistakes that's how you get to be good with women. You take risks and it doesn't always work out and that's part of life. "
"You feel like you're losing her? Because she looked at an attractive man at an entertainment venue? You are completely dramatic and insecure here. And yes, you are a prude in fact."
Yes. I’d be curious to hear her side. The whole post is about how he was made to feel because of her. She works so why should she make dinner? Why not share all of that like with drop off and pick up (currently shared). 
"It's because by the time things in a relationship get bad enough that someone says, in desperation, ""hey maybe I should ask anonymous internet strangers on Reddit what I should do,"" the relationship is often beyond repair."
"People often post here with terrible relationships, like the woman who's husband dumped her out in a dangerous part of town in high heels then accused her of sucking a hobo's dick because it took her so long to walk home.

Often, you need to accept that walking away may be the only thing that gets them to realize they fucked up royally. Often, the person needs to realize they deserve better treatment than this. And quite often, they come here because they don't have anyone else to tell them to care for their emotional health. My own mother is currently encouraging my sister to stay with her cheated 5x husband who had a convicted felon and drug addict girlfriend stay in their home when she moved out. But you know, anything to keep the peace."

If you are being a shitty boyfriend because your girlfriend pierced her belly button you aren't ready to be in a relationship.
"Seconding the ""miscarriage."" It gives OP a safety net to get her escape plan together without a blowup from the boyfriend, and means her parents won't turn against her when she might need their support. "
"I second this. If he's only a couple weeks removed from leaving his job it could still be weighing on him heavily, especially after being lied to about a promotion. I had a similar experience about a year ago when I was promised a promotion and got fired instead, and it sent me into some of the worst self-hating depression I've ever had. That's me though, and I have a history with depression.

If he's anywhere near the headspace I was stuck in, a little lie like that is likely his way to avoid talking about how he didn't have the motivation. Calling him out with facts might make him avoid the topic because he doesn't have the energy to defend and explain why he didn't go out. 

I owe a great deal to my fiancé for standing by my side and giving me so much support. I struggled to find the strength to look for work after being fired, and kept procrastinating because I just kept thinking ""What's the point? Who would hire me?"" My fiancé would sit me down and we would talk about how I hadn't been applying and how depressed I'd been. She wouldn't call me out for not trying, she just gave me constant support and reinforcement. Even when I was in a place where I couldn't believe the positive things she was saying, it meant a great deal to hear them, and over time it went a long way."
"I'm sorry you spent 4 of your years in a relationship that didn't work out, but compare 4 years to your life ahead, free from all this drama.

Honestly, she's a very good manipulator; clingy in fact. And you're right in saying you are enabling her behaviour, most guys would have just cut her off without entertaining her crazy postbreakup antics.

But this time care for yourself. 

&gt;Last week, she commented about how we needed to help her ex’s family and how she needed more money for bills. 

Read what you wrote. And read again, and read it 1000 times. Do you find this absurd? Why do **you**, her fiance, needs to help her ex at all!?

&gt;Her brother also sent texts assuring me that we could work out the relationship and that my other family didn't want me to leave.

Even her brother sounds crazy.

&gt;She insisted we stay together because she didn’t consent to the breakup.

How absurd, this woman is defo out of her mind (BTW I am a female too fyi). You are not her slave lol, why would you need her consent to breakup if you aren't feeling it anymore?

&gt;I didn’t budge, so she demanded that I go to her house and tell her kids why I was leaving them. 

Eh... manipulating you using her kids, such a low blow. If you feel bad for her kids, tell her you'd write them a letter and send it to her address for them. **Do not meet her**

&gt;When I refused, she demanded that I meet her at a hotel for the night so I could yell and scream at her.

LOL, so that she can use that against you as abuse? And tell the authorities and her next victim that her ex was ""abusing"" her?Not sure about you but when I typed this, it sounded so familiar to what she told you about her ex (all those accusations).

&gt;I had this all under control, but now I don’t know who the hell I was going to marry. I don’t even know if I should meet her in person.

Dude the only person you are in control of is yourself and your response to such a woman and her antics.

Ultimately you can do whatever you want, but judging from the fact that you posted on reddit, you know you shouldnt be marrying her, you shouldnt be responsible for her life (and what, her ex's life????)

Let us know how it goes, good luck man."
"1. It's cheating

2. It's playing fast and loose with family money

3. I'd say it's a 50/50 chance that it IS his kid. That's a lot of dough to pay a random stranger.

4. Stay out of it, this is for mom and dad to sort out between themselves

5. It's too soon to know what to think or feel. Maybe you'll learn to understand it. maybe its unforgivable. Dont make sudden decisions"

Evidently he's not ready. 

I can't tell if you are ready or not (you shouldn't be, it's too soon).

**Your parent's opinion is utterly irrelevant.** If you want to marry so soon just because mummy and daddy say so, you are by definition not mature enough to marry.

Oh and yes, 3 months is ridiculous. Why 3 months?"
"There's a lot more issue with this guy than just having an issue with your language learning. He's shown to

* make aggressive jokes that have been repeated enough to know he's half serious
* Takes offence on the smallest argments and escallates it to prove he's right
* Feels superior by making snide remarks on your effort to learn. 
* Has not respected your concerns over his reaction and places the blame on you.

He has an issue that he HAS to be right about everything and he's only okay with a joke when he feels superior to the issue. I bet once you tell him that your efforts to learn a 4th language is better than his attempt to learn a 3rd will set him off."

"I think as people establish independence and the boundaries of the parental relationship change, there's going to be a bump or two.  Especially also because parents may misinterpret things as being reckless and unusual which are much more normal now.

Of course, you see ridiculous/awful relationships here, ... but even for people with a normal parental relationship, there'll be a misstep or two, and you'll only hear about it.

People even go wrong in the opposite direction--- my parents had overly-meddling parents... and went too far to being hands off when we reached adulthood.  Glad to give their opinion when asked, but maybe a bit less willing to speak up when they saw problems coming than they should have been..."

"Also make sure your parents are on board too. She may go behind your back to maintain contact, and guilt them into not telling you. She sounds very manipulative. I would also check to see if your parents have been giving her money.

I would also dislike a woman who kept planning trips with my husband and never invited me. Julia is not a nice woman.
"Your decision about whether you are going to have a relationship with your sister is yours.  Do not Justify, Argue, Defend, or Explain your decision.  If your boyfriend brings it up again, your full response is ""I'm sorry you feel that way,"" or ""This is not up for discussion,"" or ""Fuck off,"" or if it comes to it, ""I don't think we should see each other anymore.""

And for the record, I don't think your sister set out to steal this guy from his girlfriend, they just liked each other and grew close.  I think she could have done things a little differently, like not cuddling him on the couch or sleeping in the same room out of respect for that relationship, but if they weren't messing around she got the most important thing right.  And if they didn't, my god, she's 18, she's allowed to make some mistakes."

"I think it's a good sign that she is willing to share it with you and show you everything. I feel like she deserves some credit for that. She has also been completely honest and open about feeling unsexy lately. To me that says she is trustworthy.

It might be a bad sign that her desire to find validation elsewhere correlates with you not being in the mood for sex. I don't think it's unethical, but it seems like a bad sign. Why aren't you in the mood? You need to look into yourself and reflect on that. Then be honest with her like she is with you.

I don't think this is totally a negative thing. If you are honest with each other and genuinely like each other then maybe you can use this as a good growth opportunity. Use it as a launchpad to understand each other better. Good luck."
"Personally I feel like one of the most worrying things is your boyfriends' rather intense reaction to you disagreeing with him on this. Sleeping in the living room because you guys are disagreeing? It seems like a very defensive reaction to something that's not even really about him (although I understand he's involved since he's choosing to remain friends with this person). Makes it sound like he has some of his own creepy thoughts on hooking up with underage people, just saying. The defensiveness is also stopping any kind of meaningful conversation happening between you two where you can try to explain why his friend's behaviour isn't forgivable. It's going to turn into a stalemate if he doesn't get over himself and open up to seeing your perspective. 


I've heard this sort of argument that people should be forgiven countless times. I have an ex friend who I had to cut off because I told him of a mutual friend's attempt at raping an acquaintance, in the hope that I'd get some support for dropping this guy from the friend group. To cut a long story short, nothing of consequence happened to this guy, and every time I met up with my friend, he'd try to convince me the guy had changed and was ""doing really well"" (at what, not raping people? Congrats mate). Some people WANT to be ignorant.


Edit: Changed ""isn't ok"" to ""isn't forgivable"" because I know you said in another comment your boyfriend doesn't think the behaviour was ""ok"", just forgivable."

"While this is tempting as a vindictive course of action, if OP wants to be friends with James in the future, being so callous and flippant about something that is causing him so much pain is not going to help matters. Yes, this was totally unfair of James, but if he's a half-decent person he's going to realize that on his own. It could be that, down the road, he reflects on the situation and realizes that he just took out all this anger on his good friend and half-sister, who wasn't at fault for being the product of an affair. OP, I'd not respond at all to this email until your family figures out what kind of relationships they want going forward. "

"He obviously doesn't want to rent a Durango (or any other car) because it'd cost a hell of a lot more than just half your payment. When employers have their employees drive for work, I think the typical reimbursement now is about 54 cents per mile, or about $3240 for 6000 miles. Your dad knows full well that he'd be putting a hell of a lot more wear and tear on your vehicle than the maybe $300 that he'd give you to cover half your payment.

Shut his bullshit down and tell him, ""Fuck no."" A parent in this culture is pretty much expected to let their kid drive around a car (usually a the crappiest car in the family) so they can do social stuff as a young adult. And letting a family member use your car for a short while when their's is broken - that's also in the realm of reasonable behavior. But your father is trying to manipulate you into going far beyond what's reasonable, just because he allowed you some small-scale reasonable use of his vehicles in the past. Fuck this guy. Let his broke ass pay his own bills and get the fuck out of your house, seriously."

"She got back this weekend. She was gone for 2 weeks, and the bite happened at the beginning of the vacation. Part of why she opted out of getting the rest of the shots was because she did feel really shitty and rundown and missed out on snorkeling or something the day after she got the first round of shots, and didn't want the rest of the shots to mess up her vacation. And she was convinced that missing the shots wasn't a big deal, and that the doctors didn't tell her how important getting the full set of shots was. "
"The 4 year old needs consequences for her behavior.  Consistent consequences.  Timeouts are common.  If you're babysitting the kid for hours a day, you have to be able to give consequences or the kid will figure out there are no consequences for bad behavior.

"Your parents and Ben could have handled your parentage better and more responsibly several decades ago. The truth was bound to come out, the older generation already knew (of course your parents figured out a long time ago that you were related to Ben rather than your father), and none of this is your fault. It's their mess from 27 years ago.

Give the younger generation some space, ignore the terrible email, and find a good therapist. You'll need it. And maybe keep in mind that this doesn't change the fact that you have a mother and a father - you just finally know why you share characteristics with Ben, and you can also have a relationship with him in the future, if you like."
I would react the same way because I don’t have insurance and have massive medical debt for ER visits and the priciest of those bills are the lab work. I’m talking thousands of dollars.

Maybe it takes a year, maybe it takes 10, but your parents are gone and she's not. I feel like a lot of times in these situations, the children aren't even fully aware of what is happening to the sibling because they can't see past their own world.

I see a great opportunity for compromise here with the two of you. I bet you could make a deal. Something like, no planning for your partner on a day off like the one described. Feel free to offer them a smoothie and invite them along for a dog walk or errand but let go of expectations.

"Yeah, the “I’m not worthy” makes me think it’s a bigger issue than wanting to be left alone when sick. Maybe he cheated, feels awful for her helping when he is sick. Maybe his sickness was self induced with drugs or alcohol. These are of course, speculation, but to me it does seem more than just wanting to be left alone because he is sick. "
"I promise you the women he stares at find it disrespectful too. Most women don't go to the gym for attention. I would dump him, but whether or not you do that, his behavior isn't okay."
"I love cooking, and my worst nightmare is that everyone is secretly faking that they like my food. If I was in your girlfriend's situation I would really really want to know. "
"If it's been three years and nothing has changed, you should accept the way things are."
"I like a lot of salt so I can imagine the girlfriend would find the class not to her taste, I think it’s difficult to get out of it that way. "
"Oof, that's such a gross tactic. He wants you to feel confused so you'll stop questioning his actions. "
"DUMP HIM.

That is all."
You hate that he slept with another woman so you slept with every guy that so much as winked at you? For everyone’s sake I hope you used protection...
"&gt; You really kicked the Reddit hornets nest tonight.

If you think this is bad, you haven't seen my PMs. The amount of people who seemingly despise alicia over this... I just did not expect this. At all. "
"Sorry, no. Your girlfriend is an adult. She’s responsible for her emotions and how she handles life - not her ex. 

She dropped out of school because she felt like it was a waste of time? Her decision. Please explain how her ex was 1. Responsible for that decision 2. To “stop” her from making that decision that she’s an adult and responsible for that decision. They weren’t together as you’ve previously stated, why should he care if she drops out of school?

He generously paid for everything. Your girlfriend decided since he paid for everything she didn’t need to work. Again, a decision she made. She had no motivation to work? That’s on her as well, especially knowing she owed her ex rent.

Your girlfriend was basically an alcoholic before she met you? Once again, her decision. She chose to live this way. How exactly could her ex have helped her? 

Your girlfriend may have been miserable but clearly not too miserable to financially depend on her ex instead of being an adult and get her life together like adults do.

"
"Hmm I'm not totally convinced he didn't tell Jenny and she's the one who told him to uninvite you. I mean you never really know what's going on in a relationship between two other people. Maybe she was already jealous of the time he spent with you and then he told her about the encounter after denying it for ages. Maybe Jack told Jenny to cut contact with a guy friend she had hooked up with once upon a time and didn't want to be a hypocrite. 


Whether he did/she did it, doesn't really matter. It was an incredibly hurtful thing to do, and inconsiderate of the fact you changed birthday plans to come. Do something nice with your boyfriend and family instead. Not sure reconciling with Jack or Jenny is a good idea either. It sucks to lose two good friends though, and over something so petty. Many hugs OP "
"Oh boo hoo no TV! How could one live with no TV! 

Are you for real? 

If she can't afford a laptop for school- go to the library! 

Seriously, you guys sound childish, selfish, pampered and self-absorbed. 
Your girlfriend is right to be worried. 
She counted on HIS money to pay for her lifestyle and now not only the Golden egg laying goose is gone, it wants the eggs back. 

Does she work? Would YOU pay for her bills? 

You need a reality check on values badly. "
"What else has he lied about?  How many other times did he grind with women, or more?  Clearly, he doesn’t feel bad about lying.

Do you want to marry this man?"
"College admissions process have seen this kind of thing a lot. There's a whole lot of parents who go crazy for various reasons at the idea of their children slipping out of their grip.

Stay in close touch with the college folks, and don't be afraid to be out to them; there's likely a lot of resources that you can access if you ask for help.

Very worst case, deferring for a year, while you gather your resources to get away is possible, but be careful about taking too much damage by staying near homophobic people in the interim."
"Ha, I've just typed out a question related to this. My wife is addicted to phone games. I have no advice for you, but I know how you feel."
We just had our two year anniversary. But we both got bad colds so we had to cancel our fancy dinner. We rescheduled though! Still can’t wait to take him on a date to celebrate! Every day I feel more loved than the last. 
And somehow the SO was able to save more money than her and she is pissed. It seems like she is a bad budget-er but got mad at her SO rather than own up to it.
"Too bad /u/BlueWaterbottle24 miscalculated, terribly. OP is excluding vet and ferrier costs. It also excludes the cost of living in and renovating their dump of a house/property."
"You're a nice person and she's lucky to have you. It will take her some time to make peace with her losses. It's a very very good sign that she's active, has friends, isn't co dependent on you, and has a few family members she still feels close to. Those are all signs she will be able to pull through and get better. That's a heavy fucking loss and it will take her a while. It sounds like you're doing what you can for her right now. Make sure YOU get the support you need too - it's hard to watch someone you care for just simply hurt. Keep the communication open for her. I'm sure that helps a ton. I hope she gets well and you guys can build a happy life together. "
"I mean, I don't like the smell of pot either. I don't think anyone should be arrested for it as long a is used safely, but people who don't like certain smells are not automatically conservative assholes. "
"If you know there's a breakup happening, break up with him and start moving on. Why be with someone that doesn't want to be in a relationship with you and wait for them to break up with you?

You need to end this, it's going to happen either way. Don't prolong it by waiting for him. Move on."
To her it is a big deal.
"...your sister is an adult. I understand them saying that her GF can't stay in their house, thats their home and their decision. I have no idea whats preventing your sister from going to see her GF? Your sister is an adult."
"&gt;At the back of my mind I'm worried about them finding out about the location and time from other sources and showing up anyway. I'm also worried that they might retaliate by spreading lies about my fiancee.

If this is a concern, then you're absolutely right not to invite these people. If they spread lies, that's on them, but you definitely should not have them at your wedding, nor in your life at all. Never let these people meet your children."
"That seems like a really weird thing to leave out of this post (and your other comments) about how this guy isn't pulling his weight, but on the other hand, that is still *his* income, isn't it?

I agree you should actually be able to sit down together and figure out what are shared expenses (rent, bills, food, household stuff) and how you can split those between you equitably. If he won't talk about that then you have a communication issue and that's a problem, though to be honest you seem to simply dislike this guy enough that poor communication is probably the least of your problems. However, I'm assuming that as things stand you know how much the rent and bills add up to and that it's more than the shared costs you're shouldering, so I really don't think you have grounds to complain that he's enriching himself at your expense. If anyone's got something to complain about here, it'd be his parents."
"The things SIL is asking are absurd no matter how OP feels about the niece. Driving 2 hours to take her shopping? SIL is also under the impression that they're going to pay for her daughter's college like who tf does that? And also asking for $100k for home renovations. 

That's ridiculous and unfortunately could cause bitterness toward the niece. OP and her husband should be able to do things with her on their terms. Not when SIL doesn't wanna do the hard and financial shit of being a parent."
"It’s time for her to grow up, especially if she’s a hypocrite and would be upset if you tried to pull the same shit. I’m not really sure what else to say about it, “I’m not sure how to tell my friends” is not something I would want to hear to be honest. Really she just needs to grow up, she’s not 12 any more. "
"Yes, I am sure Dr. is aware of the potential treachery of human behavior. But he took Jane on in his lab for whatever reason, and it will take a lot to convince him that Jane is purposely sabotaging you.

:) yes the more vocal you are about what’s happening, the more scared she’ll get. Pipettes can get loosened... over years, not overnight. I was also in a similar situation, and am also mildly introverted. I learned that people like Jane prey on quiet people, because we don’t speak up. But you have to speak up! It’s in the Dr.’s best interest also, to know if anything is malfunctioning or missing in the lab that he runs. You can approach it professionally in that way."
"Sorry to say, but he has formed an unbreakable bond with this girl well before you even met him. He may not think of her as a romantic partner, but as you get older you begin to cherish and appreciate the connections you make with the handful of people who show up to your life story.

He may realize that this friend is the best candidate to settle down with, even if it's in 5-10 years. From what I understand, with a marriage the most important thing for it to last a long time is mutual compatibility, for the big things as well as the stupid little domestic things. And he seems to have that with his friend.

On the other hand, he may be clinging to past relationships as a way to cope with the overwhelming changes in his life. He's planning on getting married, for starters. And the past, though a comfortable place to be, may not be the best place to dwell and hedge your bets for future relationships. He may just be in the process of growing up... sort of ""graduating"" to you as a way to fully embrace adult life.

You should talk to him. Really talk to him and prepare the hard questions before you marry him. Ask if he can imagine being with his friend as his wife instead of you. Ask him how he feels about it. Why would or wouldn't he enjoy this alternate arrangement? And is he just holding on to his friend as a way to hold onto his childhood?

I probably left you more confused than you started, I'll just go now... "
"This is absolutely ridiculous. For one thing, she literally just told him a few hours earlier that being spat on is a deal breaker for her, so he knew she wouldn't be receptive.

For another, who the hell ""tests out"" fetishes in public without asking?! "
Who cares? They were broken up at the time.

"I understand, I'm just saying that it's a common generalization that is very damaging to the idea of rehabilitation because it lumps everyone who is incarcerated into the ""bad person"" category and once society puts you in that category it's very difficult to change that and only forces people to keep making bad choices to survive once they're out because they've already been labelled.

Just because someone has made poor choices in the past doesn't mean they are an unworthy person or incapable of change."
"Yes. My mom is as well. It tends to be ok until you start differentiating yourself from her, making your own decisions, and building your own life.

Either she’ll move on and focus on her own stuff as you’re no longer useful or she will do everything she can to try to convince you that your fiancé is evil. She might flip between both modes.

Be prepared to have some wedding issues and for her to make it all about her, if she ends up showing interest."
"You'd be shocked how many men (and maybe women but I've never had one try it with me) try to make you fall for their woe is me bullshit about their current (or recently finished) relationship, and then idk maybe pity date them.

"First of all, I'm so sorry for everything you are going through. Second, He is your ex, so he has no say in what is best for you in the moment. 

Sweets, do what's best for you and your kids and Fhim! Who is better equipped to care for your children? I'm totally betting its you. So he has less than no say.

I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. I'm sending you all love and positivity. Stay strong and continue to do what's best for your kids and you. "
"First thing that went through my mind.

"It was a teacher, but things like that are the least of their concern at my school.

People are saying go to the police but I'm real hesitant.. I see all these stories on the news and tge internet about girls that try to tell the police about assault and such but it either isnt taken seriously, starts a bunch of drama, and he never gets punished. And I guess the teacher was sorta right that he didnt rape me or molest me, so i dont even think they would waste their time listening."
"He's in prison. Watched ""Love after Lockup"" which is a train wreck but the one unifying thing is that when the inmates are released suddenly it's a whole world of other things they can do and people to date and you risk spending years waiting for him just for him to meet someone else. You're just the ""safe one"".
In fact, i'd tell him that if you are both in a place to be interested in a relationship after prison, you'll talk, if you really want to. But the reason your mind is blank is because you haven't met the next person. But you will. :)
Also why are you watching his daughter for overnight visits when she manipulates you? You're not her stepmother and this is not your responsibility..
"
"&gt;My boyfriend said that he knows his co-worker, and doesn't think the guy is a creep. 

Yeah, this part got to me as well. Oh, well, since this guy you only know professionally doesn't strike you, a straight man, as creepy, that definitely cancels out your girlfriend's lived experiences of being violently forcibly kidnapped by him."

"Gotta tell ya, I HATE people like you driving down the street. I shouldn’t have to hear your shit stereo rattling things in my house. ( and I love music AND bass.) You should probably do a little more research- bass can absolutely cause ear damage-   I tend to agree with your girlfriend-you shouldn’t be acting like a thug with her kid in the car. That being said, it’s your hobby and your passion and she should respect that as long as it doesn’t effect her or her kid. "
"I honestly think the whole quitting the job suddenly was a ""oh shit we're having a baby"" freak out on his part, as he never even mentioned being unhappy at his job until the baby was part of the equation. 

The problem is, he can't get a job ANYWHERE. He claims its bad luck, I think its more in how he presents himself. One of his friends tried to get him a job as a bartender, since he bar tended in college. The bar his friend worked at wouldn't hire him. He got desperate enough to apply to Starbucks last week. STARBUCKS wouldn't hire him. It's not even pride at this point. NO ONE wants him. That's why he's so prickly about it. 

I think his problem, honestly, is his resume and how he interviews. In the Starbucks phone interview, I overheard him saying he just wanted a temporary gig until he got something better, and then he was surprised they didn't want him. And I feel like I can't even say anything about that because he'll blow up at me, deflecting the anger on me from himself. 

It's gotten so bad that I begged my dad, a guy that job hopped a lot when I was a kid and always got a job fairly quickly, with awesome resume and interviewing skills, to give him a ""Come to Jesus"" talk when we visit over Easter. I am praying on every God known to man that somehow this works. Or that my dad knows a guy that will hand him a job out of pity. If he can't get a job soon I have no idea what we will do. "
"If I were the husband I’d call my friends to let them know I wouldn’t be at the party. I’d explain that due to my wife not being welcome, I’m not welcome either. I’d thank them for their wives honesty, in being terrible people and I’d never talk to them again. I chose to be with my wife for the rest of my life. Those other people are just in it for awhile. "
"Sure, and if the dad wants that responsibility and steps up to cover half the costs too (which come to a lot more than 350 or even 750, trust me) that's great... my dad was given free reign to visit us and spend time with us... he chose to get us every other week for a few hours, which then dropped to once a month... and then pretty much just a few hours on major holidays.  There's a lot of parents out there who aren't going to step up in any way if they aren't made to."
"It is so incredibly unlikely she's doing this on purpose. I think you could probably see me naked in my room if you stared right at my window and craned your neck to get the right angle and turned off all your lights to combat the glare, but that's--on you. Her husband was the one standing there in the dark, gawking between the curtains at her.

"My partner will never shut up if you let him keep going. I love him dearly, but sometimes (often, actually), he will switch from having a conversation with me to just talking AT me. He just does his thinking through external processing and knows he can get tiring when he has his fourth half-hour speech on cryptocurrencies for the day. 

I have told him how I feel and we've discussed it when we had some time. And when he is actually in the moment, I will call him out and ask him to stop, let me talk, change the subject, or give me some quiet time to myself.
Works out great!! 

But this guy in OP's post is really bizarre. I almost suspect he's a narcissist and she has too good of a self esteem, and it's bothering him because someone who feels good about themselves won't be susceptible to a narcissist's manipulation tactics. "
"Replace football with gaming, and...yep. "
If you talk to him maybe point him in the direction of parenting books or something. Often people emulate their parents simply because they don’t know what else to do. So they fall into what’s familiar.

Thank you so much for doing what you do. I know putting these shows on is a lot of work but me and people like me will always appreciate it and even prefer smaller indie shows to the big WWE ones.
Sounds like a great tattoo artist. 
"This is the correct answer. They don't dislike OP because of tattoos. They don't care about the outward appearance of tattoos. They do care about the outward appearance of their child going through a messy divorce because he got engaged at 21. The parents think OP is too immature to be making these decisions; the fact that OP reduces this to ""the ONLY reason they hate me is my tattoos"" is only proving their point. Grow up, OP. These people dislike you for legitimate reasons."
"So what do you guys talk about?  

Btw, I wouldn't consider small talk to encompass stories about your day.  If you're saying ""how was your day?"" that's small talk.  If you're telling specific stories about your day, that's not really small talk.  You're sharing something that you find interesting.  "
"The suggestion is fine, but if it doesn't work - forget the ultimatum.   You told her you don't like the idea.  Let her make her decision about her body and then wait to see how you feel about the face ink.  If it doesn't end up bothering you as much as you feared it would, it's a non-issue.  If it does, then break up then.  This memel about ""dealbreakers"" that involve someone else's independent decisions are just attempts to dominate and impose, masquerading behind giving partners fair warning about consequences.  "
"I love me some Lundy Bancroft and read him for insight into some familial dynamics. I definitely think that it’s super applicable here. Throwing and breaking things as an expression of anger is, IMO, unacceptable in a relationship, particularly as it can become a tool (by Bancroft’s argument) for intimidating and threatening witnesses to such anger (such as OP) and implicitly control their actions by forcing them to placate the angry person in order to avoid such displays. "
"Not therapist, psychiatrist."
"So a guy  across the street stood up for you and your boyfriend, who was standing right by you didn't?   

He justifies carrying on with his ex by saying that he should be able to have women friends?

You know that you can find someone better don't you?  You know that there are plenty of men who would stand up for you and put you first.   So why don't you leave this guy behind and find a man like that."
"&gt;At one point, I couldn't take it anymore, and asked my husband to gently tell her to go a little easy as if it were his opinion. She threw a tantrum, talked random crap behind my back (which, obviously, doesn't stay behind my back when she does it in front of my husband), and didn't talk to me for a week - until I agreed to do it her way.

You need to be on the same page with your husband about how to handle this, and he needs to be willing to shut his mom down. If not, this is going to get SOOOO much worse as you enter married life. Every holiday, every parenting decision (if you are interested in kids), **everything** will revolve around MIL's tantrums. 

You might want to take a gander at r/JUSTNOMIL because this sounds like a pretty classic scenario they see over there all the time."
"Looks can be deceiving. If she’s lived all over the world and her father is an engineer, she is probably quite smart and well-cultured. 

Wearing nice things and caring about one’s appearance does not invalidate her intelligence.

And to be fair, you kinda seemed like a jerk as a first impression. And getting a drink spilt on me by anyone would leave a bad taste in my mouth, especially if I didn’t know them yet."
"I did call her, and text her, she didn't respond until I was already leaving. I mean shit, my friends parents just died. I'm not going to tell her 'oh my wife hasnt responded so I cant go to you'. I had 4 hours free until my wife even got off from work, its not like I had obligations to be home or anything. "
Parents tend to get rather angry when someone threatens bodily harm on their 13-year-old child. u/redhairedtyrant has attested to that upthread.
"Be cautious. You can also find a hot guy to date who DIDN'T bully you, or anyone else, in high school."
"I don't think so...

She is just terrible at making decisions. When faced with A, B or C, she just gets stressed and shuts down. I think this is just fear of the future manifesting itself in negative ways. The thing is, she KNOWS this. This is why she lashes out whenever someone asks how the job search is going, or when shes getting her own place."
You are underreacting. You are **massively** underreacting. He introduced you as his BABYSITTER. It's been a YEAR. This boy needs to get on the level right now or you need to kick him to the curb. Why on earth would you put up with this for any length of time?
"Some people never get completely over their exes, especially if it was a painful breakup, especially if they're emotional in general. Your ex is probably not over her, probably never will be, largely due to getting no closure and still being hurt. But that doesn't mean he doesn't love you or would leave you for her if the opportunity presented itself.

I say if you love him, it's not a huge deal. But that's just me"
"So, 

1. fake breakup. 

2. fake some urgent need (unforseen college expenses, field trip, broken computer, you need a car...) and get the cash.

But worst case that money has gone. At least it's ""only"" 6k, not a 'deposit for  buying a house' quantity."
He confessed to you and expects you to solve his problem for him. He really has no other plan to help himself?
"Same here! My dad was my hero when I was younger (my first word was ""dad"", ffs), but around ten or so, we started to butt heads. We didn't really ""reconnect"" until I was about 22. So it could well be a developmental stage, albeit kind of a painful one. 

I agree with the other posters, though. OP should totally let their dad know she loves them."
"I think she guessed she could get away with not buying a gift, and realizes I wasn’t the thoughtful choice. She would’ve gotten away with it fine except someone else showed you care now. Her anger is really very selfish and you’d be right to call her out on it."
"I would agree with everything you said if the OP had said to his wife, ""I don't want anything for my birthday."" Maybe he did just that."
The point is he would have to “keep it up” for a seriously long period of time for the lack of fiber or protein to hurt him. 
"Why does he HAVE to go to bed at the same time you do? In your first example you said you wanted to go to sleep at 10, but he waited until 10:30... why didn't you just go to sleep at 10, and he could join you later on? (If the answer to this question is that he wakes you up when he comes to bed, you could just talk to him about that and have him be extra quiet and careful, or if that doesn't work, you could sleep separately during the week. But it seems really silly that he needs to go to bed at the exact same time as you - my boyfriend and I have almost the exact same work schedules, but even then we often get into bed at different times.)"
"Somewhat? The reason for the breakup wasn't great, they kept getting into arguments that made both of them feel awful about themselves, but the breakup itself was hard but civil. Lots of discussion and no malicious things said or done."
"My parents were like this when I was living with them 3 years ago. One time I was in the kitchen and could hear them, so I went in my room which is on the other side of the house. After they finished they were in the kitchen, so I walked out and greeted them, then said ,""Sounds like you two were having fun!"" They got the hint, laughed and said, ""Sorry!"" After that they were more mindful of their volume, but overall you cant ask them to not have sex. Its their house. Go live in a dorm if you wanna get out, but you'll still hear and see people having sex"
"She mentioned in the OP that the kid was a ""constant source of issues"". Not starting trouble. In the comments she says these are the ""issues"":

&gt;They are issues my husband has. He feels guilty over the divorce. He feels guilty he isn't with his daughter more. He feels guilty we had another child. He feels guilty he sees that child 24/7 and only sees his daughter EOW+ a little bit of time. He thinks I want him to favor our child over his daughter. I could go on.

This kid's only crimes are existing and having a loving, involved father."
"I would leave him. 

People who rationalize lying once, twice, etc. are sure to do it again and again. They'll come up with reasons that sound altruistic: ""I didn't want to hurt you""; ""It didn't mean anything, I was drunk at the time""; etc. but in the end its always the same - they're selfish and think they can get away with it. 

You'd be naive to believe this is the one thing he hasn't told you about. Find someone who you can trust. 

Good luck. "
"Hit all the critical points here IMO

I'd like to add that there's nothing wrong with having a preference. I don't see a problem with a white person enjoying asian culture and women, I only have a problem with him forcing it on you. "
"Yeah, I’m really curious what those “issues” are."
"Honestly, this is where you went wrong:

&gt; I respected her wishes and just thought she would maybe change her mind, but I was not going to pressure her to move faster than she wanted to.


It seems to me like your expectations going into the relationship were skewed. You have *nearly* explicitly stated it, but your post reads like you were hoping, if not expecting that she was going to change her mind on this aspect of her sexuality as time went on, and I really don't think you have respected her wishes.


No, you are not an asshole for desiring full-on sex in a relationship, that's perfectly normal, but in *this* relationship, you knew what you were getting into. While you are not directly pressuring her into having sex, I think it's very unfair to your girlfriend for you to voice this frustration to her when it was understood between both of you that she was not going to be having sex before marriage. I could understand if this was something she withheld from you and ""led you on"" by omission, but she told you before you started dating what her views were on sex, and you agreed to be a part of that by entering into a relationship under those terms.


In terms of practicality? I don't know if you have many options. it just seems like you are not compatible anymore. I think probably your best case scenario is you both look for somebody who is more compatible with the other, and take this as a hard lesson for future relationships (not necessarily about ""sex before marriage"", but about expectations in relationships, and figuring out what aspects of a relationship are necessary for you before you enter into one)"
Thank you. That was an amazingly entitled thing to ask.
Time to dump him. You're basically dealing with a trainwreck of a human and the thanks you get for it is him complaining to you that your body isn't perfect enough by his impossible standards.
Call animal control and report her 
So he suffers as a result. Poor guy. Take a sleeping pill. Go to a therapist. 
"You've got no reason to feel guilty. She dumped you, you tried to start moving on, she got back with you, she realised that you weren't going to remain abstinent whilst she was away, she gets upset. All of this is screaming to me ""TOUGH SH!T"" lol. She dug her own grave on that one. "
"I love that you use the term break up instead of divorce. 

You got played. Tale as old as time. If she wanted to be with you, she'd be with you. This isn't rocket science. You did a crappy, crummy thing. Don't ever be that guy again. Separate yourself from her life. Make new friends. Leave her and her marriage alone."

I think what's happening is that your girlfriend is opening your eyes to race relations and racism in a way that you hadn't experienced before. Your friends are seeing the change and misunderstanding. No, you're not fetishizing her. You're learning from her and adapting your behavior. You're growing up and your relationship is helping you become a better person. That's a good thing. "
"You did, but very minimally. You talked for a long, long time about your exes positive traits though..."
Op choking IS violent and corresponds with this behavior. He is abusive and if you go back he WILL eventually kill you. 
"Talk to him.

You already know that going ahead with the pregnancy will probably end the relationship with him. That's a reality you're just going to have to consider in your decision-making process.

You can let him in on that decision-making process as much or as little as you'd like, but I'd start with being very open with him about the situation and your own feelings. That's the best way honor and preserve the relationship. If he can discuss it plainly and respectfully with you, all the better. If he can't do that, close the door the make the decision without him. "
Right? I'd fucking have high blood pressure and depression too.
"She won't let him do that either, though, from everything he's written here. That's so not cool. Everywhere he tries to get help she says maybe they shouldn't have had a kid because she doesn't need help (even though she's getting lots of it) so he shouldn't need help either. "
Complete and total false equivalence.
"Yeah, agreed - I'm willing to bet the parents don't have a good/healthy sense of boundaries and raised the sister accordingly."
"I do not think you are overreacting. At all. I would be super pissed if my friend did this to me. Furthermore, I would not room with her in the future. I have no doubt this girl will do this to you again given the opportunity and the fact that the guy cleaned himself up with YOUR CLOTHES is...fucking gross. "
"&gt;Are we wrong 

yes. hopefully the people who got invited to both find a way to let you know."
"I would go so far as to say: Their House, Their Rules. Your House, None of Their  Damn Business.

And that OP should tell her parents now is the time for them to check out local B&amp;Bs or Boutique Hotels.

"
Yeah probably. I realize that's tough for many people. But it would be better for you to work on that and protect yourself than to be sorry later.
"There's nothing worrisome about blood pressure medication, antidepressants or a pregnancy test. It's not like she opened the cabinet (which she shouldn't have done in the first place) and found medications for cancer or something. Digging through someone's bathroom cabinet and then dragging their perfectly normal and unalarming health issues into a family dinner is shitty, and it doesn't come from a place of concern. "
"I don't get the masturbation thing - I get societal strictures around sex because it was a control on fertility, but why diss masturbation? it's the only 100% true safe sex.

"For context, I have 5 dogs, four of which are rescue huskies. I had two of them when I met my SO and got the third before we moved in together. We have adopted two more together. 

You need to lay it down for him. The fence needs to be fixed, that's non negotiable. It should be priority number one. 

Number two should be created a dog safe and friendly space in order to have a dog free zone until they have the training sorted. 

Number three is bringing in a professional to point out what you've already said - this is not a safe or sustainable environment for the dogs. 

Time for a come to Jesus talk. You're not asking him to pick you over the dogs. You're asking him to make changes for the sake of the dogs so you're all happy and comfortable. 

PM me if you need help. "

"So, she overreacted by yelling at you, but you have to admit that was from the outside pretty shady."
"You think that maybe, just maybe. Because you are so okay about them sleeping with you, he has legit reason to not really trust you. 

You should give it time for him to learn to trust you and that you won't be breakinh boundries just cause he isn't around and what he won't know won't hurt.

Trust and respect are both a process. If after a period of time he refuses to trust you and respect you enough with you male friends, he needs to go or get his shit together.

You even said yourself you think there is nothing wrong with sleeping in the same bed with a guy who isn't your boyfriend. If my wife had said that when we met, i wouldn't have been very trusting of her either. Most men would react this way."
"Oh my god, not this bullshit again!
It seems you didn’t even read the post properly. OP herself admitted that she was always a clumsy person, also she said that he doesn’t yell at her when things like that happen, just calmly asks her to leave it so that he can finishes it. Well what else is he supposed to do? To tell her “keep going darling?” and patiently wait for her to break his plates? I mean it’s not their stuff she constantly drops, it’s his belongings that he paid for, and she admits that she did it not once but that she is doing it constantly. I definitely wouldn’t enjoy this sort of situation either if I was OP’s boyfriend. Sorry but clumsiness is not adorable, it’s quite annoying, and it’s not an abuse to get upset when someone breaks your stuff that costs $900."
"Tell your man what the fuck transpired in that kitchen.

That behavior is unacceptable, and will only continue and escalate if you don't stop it."
"If there is one promise that can be withdrawn at any time, anywhere, it's consent to sex."
"If she's in silent mode, you're fine. Let her be silent, you don't need to escalate back to arguing with her. But if she does bring it up again in a hostile way, I think you have the perfect response already. 

""I won't be staying with you because the house isn't child-proofed, you've said you plan to beat my child, you told me that my husband would prefer to have sex with livestock over me and you literally stuck your hand on my ass last time I visited."" 

"
"It’s a huge warning red flag that he is calling you stupid in a fight. It’s also red flags that he’s calling you stupid over such an easy thing to do and attributing such malicious intent to your actions.

To be clear, absenmintly sitting down on a bed because you forgot it might not be stable is an incredible easy thing to do. It’s such a easy mistake to do most wouldn’t even go so far as calling it neglectful. Yet your boyfriend insult you for it. Then he accuses you of trying to harm or kill and animal. He was so angry you had to leave. Those are such extreme reactions to such a small mistake.

Honestly, even if he apologies and made a big deal about how he knew he had behaved badly, then you should still be wary of what kind of person this guy is really. I’ve made some mistakes in my life and had some fights with people, but no one has ever called me stupid or made me leave because they were so angry. If someone ever would seriously accuse me of animal cruelty, then I would doubt my ability to maintain a relationship with someone that ’ows me so little that they would think me capable of that. Your boyfriends reaction just isn’t normal."
"Move on. He’s not worth your time. If he’s kissing you while he has a girlfriend, he’d do the exact same thing to you one day. Forget about him."
"It would've been a case of it-doesn't-happen-to-me-ism except for the case that it *did* happen to her.  I can't understand why that wouldn't be some sort of wake up call.

Everything you mentioned in the post is beyond reasonable and not at all too paranoid or cautious, especially if there's activity in your neighborhood and you have valuables worth protecting.

It sounds like she's just lazy and a bit boundary-pushing, which is obnoxious because she's blatantly stepping on your requests to enforce basic safety measures.

She's putting more effort into not doing these tasks and arguing about them instead of just doing them and you guys living a happier, safer, comfortable life.  It's pretty ridiculous behavior from her.

The way to put your foot down firmly is by telling her how it is affecting you, because she doesn't seem to be respecting you and how you feel about the situation.  I know you care for her but you're doing your part for her, what is she doing for you but ignoring your concern?

If she continues to be dismissive about it, you have to ask yourself if this is the kind of person you want to be with."

"&gt; controlling, angry people don't often become easy-going and accommodating. 

...unless they are trying to lure a reluctant person back in. OP should be on the lookout for that. "
"&gt;I just meant this as a joke and I thought she took it that way. She would protest when I said this to her.

So she made her dislike of the term known every single time but you thought she took it as a joke? I really wonder if you were intentionally ignoring her negative responses to your ‘jokes’ prior to her sitting down with you. In your OP you’re clearly still hung up on the idea that she’s too sensitive and you’re not the problem. "
"Okay, at first I was like ""why wouldn't you invite a man dying of cancer to your wedding?!"" Maybe you should lead with the abuser part. Hell no, don't invite him. I mean, it sucks he's dying, I guess? I don't wish death on anyone, but... I don't really care if he has cancer. He's a bad man. He hurts people and innocent animals. Why would you want him there? 

Mary can do what she wants, but you guys do not have to invite this guy to what's supposed to be a happy day celebrating your love and commitment. Why reward his abhorrent behavior and pretend it's anything less than unacceptable? 

Tell her, ""Mary, we respect your wishes to do what you want in regards to Matt. But we feel very strongly, and we do not wish to invite him. He's violent. He's an abuser. We have no room for people like that in our lives, let alone at our wedding. We love you, and we hope you understand, but we will be sticking to our guns on this one."" "
"Someone has to stand up and be the adult in the room,  and given your position as manager and (apparent) lack of participation in this situation, that someone should be you. 

Regardless of his fake girlfriend, facebook posts,  or any little peculiarities he may have,  this man does not deserve to be gossiped about and teased at work.  It isn't ok,  and it may be illegal. 

I concur with the other comments that you must have a talk with the team,  individually or as a group,  and tell them to leave that bullshit at the door.  If you see it happening you need to shut it down.  Separately,  you should have a conversation with this guy about his perceived attitude, which may be a response to bullying. 

This is a tough situation for you as a newish manager,  but it has to be done and will ultimately make you better at your job.  "
"It may be uncomfortable to find out your hero was actually a violent, drunken abuser, but that is something you are going to need to accept. 

There are no excuses, ever, for domestic violence. If you make excuses or try to preserve this image you had of him, I would say there is a big risk that one day you will find yourself in an abusive relationship, and make excuses for him.

Your mother is the real hero here. "
"That’s easy to say, but a lot tougher to do. It sounds like there were six kids in all. Depending on the moms job skills, it’d be damning them all to a life of poverty at the very least. I think many mothers with that many children would actually choose to stay if dad wasn’t abusive to the kids."
"Some of the posts on this sub really just make you do that Jackie Chan meme face.

Like, how can you possibly be questioning if you’re overreacting to your - presumably monogamous - SO *telling* you he’s going on a date with someone.

Honestly. This sounds less like “hey I’m setting up a threesome” and more like “I’m going to fuck this chick. Maybe we’ll invite you at some point”."
You are better off without her. She should have stood up to her parents.

He hid it because he knew his wife was against them. That is not fair to her on any level and a giant breach of trust. 
"In a vacuum I think this is fine; it was a long time ago, seems to have genuinely changed, etc.

I think what's a little more concerning is that you had a huge crush on him back then even when he treated you poorly and still have feelings for him... so it might blind you a little bit.

Do you have mutual friends who can vouch for him? Ex-gfs you know?"
"True but if he chooses to stay then he has to respect the boundaries that I clearly set. If he wasn't okay with those boundaries then we wouldn't still be in a relationship. We both have every right to leave, him if he wanted someone different, me if I didn't feel like being a third wheel in my own relationship anymore. "
Your boyfriend sounds like a piece of shit and I would leave him solely for his behavior described in your comment.

"The ceremony might be open to everyone in some churches, but then again people don't really get a chance to bully the bride at the ceremony, so that might be an non issue.

"My only concern is that it sounds like it's only an issue because he's got an idea of how she's ""supposed"" to spend her time and she's not doing it. It reads to me more like a control issue than anything else, in which case my advice is to just let it go. "
....so has your girlfriend said which one she prefers? Again I’m not asking which one you think is more logical - does she want to see her friends both days and you don’t want to? Or does she want to say no to her friends but doesn’t know how?
"&gt; She wanted us to ""loan"" her $100,000 which we refused

Umm, I think we glossed past this a little fast. $100,000!? For *renovations?!* I wouldn't have the audacity to ask my loved ones for this for cancer treatments, let alone fucking renovations. How self-involved must a person be to think this is okay?"
"&gt; Run the strategy by your husband as a courtesy to him.

The two of them need to put up a united front."
"You should tell the roommate, *now*.  She can believe you or not, but she should know.  I wonder if she'll remember asking him for a shirt when she was in the shower?  

Also, file a report with the police.  Even if you don't want to press charges, file that report.  Ask them what you have to do to get a restraining order against him, and if you can, get one.

And whatever you do, don't put yourself in a position where you have even the remotest chance of finding yourself alone with him.  Because he's just biding his time until he can do more than hold you down."
"I think you need to see that neither of you is wrong in certain ways. 

He is not wrong to want to stay close to his kid. To help ensure a strong relationships. To help minimize the travel time his child would have to endure. And frankly I think if he moves to be near the child and his ex tries to move again with a good attorney he can make a strong argument he accommodated her once and shouldn’t have to again. The closer the kid gets to school age the more the kid has roots in the community. 

And you’re not wrong to not want a 2 hour commute to work. That’s 4 hours a day in a car alone. I know many people do it. But many people also consider that kind of commute soul sucking. It’s completely reasonable you don’t want that type of commute. 

However, what this says to me is there is a fundamental incompatibility between you two. You want to live in one place and he can’t practically do that because he has a child. And since you can’t be in two places at once, and teleportation doesn’t exist, there’s no solution here that I can see. Unfortunately you either move your life and job to be where he is or the relationship can’t move forward and needs to end. Only you can make that choice.

It’s hard to date a single dad OP. I get it. I’ve been with one for over two years. I never anticipated staying in Current City.  But if I want to be with boyfriend that’s my only choice. His kids and their mom are here. I can’t and won’t ask him to leave them behind. So I make the sacrifice or I end things. Those are my only choices. "
"Soo essentially you have something that makes you happy and he doesn't because he can't be bothered to stick to anything? Because that's exactly how it sounds. Its almost like he can't be bothered to stay on track with anything that takes actual work and dedication. 

Has hunting dogs but doesn't hunt. Which means the dogs are bored and under worked most of the day. Oh I bet that's fun /s

Money blown on a home gym that isn't used and he'd probably shit a brick if you suggested breaking it down and selling the equipment.

Expensive gun that could be sold and at minimum half the cost recouped. 

&gt;He also said ""If you made 120k, we could discuss, but you don't""

Oh fuck him.

&gt;He is never going to be ok with spending so much money on horses, which does not bring any returns or value to his life

So why did he agree in the first place?

&gt;He resents that I am always doing chores and not spending time with him

What's stopping from help which will cut down on work time?

&gt;He is tired of seeing no return for all of the money he makes

Then maybe he should stop blowing money on hobbies he quits at the drop of a hat and get some investments.

&gt;Living in the country does not bring him joy; he hates commuting and hates our house (which admittedly wasn't constructed very well, like many houses) 

Again why the fuck did he agree to this in the first place?

I'll be honest your husband sounds like a child. He wants what he wants until he doesn't and damn the consequences. He picks shit up and then puts it down just as fast. Including your marriage. 

&gt;He has talked about divorce before; it seems to be his go-to strategy for whenever he is unhappy or doesn't feel like our relationship is what it should be

You've put up with this for two years why?

Honestly?

find a property YOU can afford. Downsize animals if you have to. Find a divorce lawyer and peace out."
"It's great you've made progress, but you have to know that your abuse was awful.  Saying you were never physically abusive doesn't mean anything because emotional and verbal abuse can have very deep and often longer lasting impact than physical abuse.  And you haven't been recovered from drugs or abuse for very long yet.

I have warned women about my abusive ex before.   Abusers can go years before abusing a new victim and i feel anyone who dates an abuser deserves to know their history.  It doesn't matter what is motivating your ex and you should cut her off.  But...this is something that could follow you for your whole life, so you need to get out ahead of it and be honest it about it early on in dating "
Agreed. He said he didn't want to date a stoner. He's OK with it now but that will likely wear off once he realizes he just associated get stoned demeanor with pot smell. 
Well I hope you gave it a twist for good measure. Animal abusers deserve it.
"honestly, i'd just text back a ""f-ck you"" and then block her number. her DEMANDING that you apologize is bullshit and f-ck you is the only real reply."
"I also want to add in that I understand being afraid to end a friendship, especially at 24. I’m a few years older than you and I remember 23-24 being a weird time when I wasn’t in school anymore and a lot of people I worked with were older than me so it suddenly felt like I had gone from making new friends all my life to a complete stand-still. I stuck by two self-serving, manipulative girls because they had been my closest friends for the last few years and I was afraid that without them, I’d feel really alone.

Not long after I cut off those friendships, I met an extremely cool girl around my age. We became fast friends. Then I met another, and another, and another. There are lots of great friendships out there worth pursuing. You don’t need to make room in your life for a bad one."
"He’s established that there’s already semen inside of the condom, so it likely wouldn’t be from a toy. Though I do second the thought that it was his daughters bf."

"You don’t know what their marriage looks like. And if she had told him, finding out his SIL knew would be painful. If she hadn’t told him but he knew they hit a rough patch and something may have gone down, bringing it up now would do no good. It happened so many years ago and to rehash it now is just vindictive. It would be one thing if you caught her cheating today, but instead it’s like you’re trying to rehash something from long ago just because you were hurt recently."

Not okay. This has to stop now. He will kill himself, and probably take some innocent lives with him while he's at it.

"That's rough, but you did the right thing. Don't let your mom tell you your ruined your sister's marriage. Your sister ruined it by being a shitty, unfaithful liar. Whether they calm down in time or not, stick to your guns and rest easy knowing you acted with integrity."
"She did try to get her sister to come clean, repeatedly. Her sister however was adamant about being a scumbag (no surprise, considering what she'd already done) and so OP decided to be the only one in her family with the decency to tell her brother in law that his new ""family"" was keeping him in the dark about a betrayal of huge proportions. She was motivated by empathy, not spite, having experienced that kind of betrayal firsthand.

You can choose to value something as arbitrary as blood over things that actually matter like character, but those of us who grew up being treated like shit by our blood have no patience for that kind of silliness. What you do matters, not what vagina you fell out of. OP's family chose to make a fool of a man who didn't deserve it and then blamed it on her when their house of cards got knocked down by one simple truth. They can burn."
"In general, yes, I absolutely agree. But I take it you've never been a young woman stalked and harassed by insistent men who say they ""just"" want to ask you out? It's a grim and even frightening experience for an adult woman, let alone a young girl. If a young man asked her politely after one or several had been stalking her through town, he'd probably get the sharp end of her tongue as well. It's hard to switch gears."
"On top of everyone else's advice, I would suggest booking a romantic weekend getaway in a REMOTE mountain location where you cannot get reception in or around the cabin.

I would certainly want to know. I'm just so bewildered how you can say I'm in the wrong for merely informing someone about their current spouse's past deceit because it might cause them emotional anguish now, and yet you don't see anything wrong with choosing to allow that deceit to continue and very possibly making them continue a relationship they would choose not to if they had informed consent? That seems like such a warped double standard. "

You say you would leave her if they slept together, but not if all they did was make out? I guess I get that but at the same time, there are lots of people who would never cheat on you at all. Who wouldn’t ignore your calls at 1am while they’re out alone with another person. Just saying.

"You should break up with her, and you should also date women your own age if you're worried about this. If you're dating women nearing the end of their childbearing years you're going to encounter women who change their minds about wanting kids.

"People typically don't just dump their friends over partners who ""really aren't that bad once you get to know them."" They got to know him and bailed on your friendship because he was emotionally manipulative and you didn't want to leave him at the time. Your BF wanted this. He wanted you alone, isolated, confused, and under his control.

This BF of yours is bad news. Get out ASAP. Get in touch with one of your friends who had a bad opinion of him, and tell them you need out. They should be happy to help you if they thought you were being manipulated.

EDIT: If your friends are good people, your friendships will always be the canary in the coal mine of a bad relationship. If they start to step back, express concern, or start to avoid your partner completely, that partner is probably no good for you."

"Yes, she has probably cheated.  I don't know if she has literally had dicks in her that aren't yours, but she clearly goes on dates with other guys at the very least.  You've caught her doing that, like multiple times.  Those one-on-one hangouts with guys late at night?  They sound like booty calls.

Even if literally all of those hangouts are in fact just friends hanging out, the way they keep happening in ways that look so suspicious is super disrespectful.  

Don't trust her.  "
"It probably is just simply less attractive to her now. My friends who are still into drugs aren’t people I’d date or be interested in now.

Unsurprisingly when I graduated I couldn’t get a job in the field and was STILL stuck at home, working retail. I noped out of home for my postgrad, performed better and secured a job in my field. It was stressful in different ways but one of my big life regrets is not moving out of my parents house during my first degree. What country you’re in will factor into your decision: I got a lot of government assistance and took out a loan for my degree. That may not be possible for you so you may need to weigh that up. "

"Why do you hold the people in your life to such different standards? You expect your sister to accurately represent your boyfriend's beliefs but you do not expect your boyfriend to be accurate in anything.

That could very well be the heart of the issue for your sister. Have you corrected her while smiling and nodding at him before? Because him irrationally vetoing your trip could be the straw that broke the camel's back.

She may be drawing a line in the sand out of fear for you. You are missing out on experiences that you want to have because of his baseless, irrational thinking. What else are you going to give up to protect his belief system?

There is a real risk that your boyfriend's theories are going to stop being something you can tolerate in a jiffy. What happens when he decides you are cheating on him without any evidence? What happens when he decides you've been compromised by a government entity? What happens if you have kids and he decides he needs to take extreme measures to ""save"" them? The longer you support irrational thinking, the harder both of you are going to fall when he stops focusing on make-believe stories on another continent and starts focusing his paranoia on the family you are creating. 

Your sister has every reason to be upset. If you keep feeding into his beliefs and holding others to a higher standard than your partner,  one day, his paranoia will swing your way and you'll have burnt bridges with everyone who could protect you. 

Go sit down with your sister and listen to her with an open-mind. Hear what she's saying without correcting or defending anything. Give her the same consideration that you currently give your boyfriend. You need people in your corner if you want to make it safely through this."
"&gt; Where is the shock and awe
  
If you can't see how her walking in during her roommates friends 
socialising (firstly) and her walking in naked asking her roommates boyfriend for a backrub (secondly) is inappropriate, well you have an agenda.     
  
&gt; She's just a bit clueless.  
  
Rubbish. She is not clueless. Stop trying to downplay it.  "
"&gt;People don't usually feel guilty for no reason.

Have you.... *met* people? Here are some thing that people feel guilt for, for basically no reason:

-having sex before marriage

-being gay

-taking a sick day at work when you're sick

-not being a huge success by the age of 30

-not drinking enough water

-minor awkward comments made as a teenager

-peeing your pants in kindergarten

People feel guilty all the time, for no good reason, OP included."
"&gt; She's still walking around, not caring about me or us for one bit.

This is also coming from a very unreliable narrator. Truth be told we have no idea how she's feeling. We get people here all the time who have ended a relationship but are still struggling emotionally. "
"&gt;scrambled to find a catalyst

Unless she has jealous delusions of infidelity despite zero evidence, which could very well be a mental health problem. She might actually believe it."
"&gt;The only person who is still mad with me is her best friend...

The best friend is doing their job, staying skeptical when the GF forgives you right away. Only thing you can do is demonstrate an established pattern of better behavior from here."
"Your gf has made it very clear she's not going to change how she acts with different guys for you. IMO, it's reasonable to want your SO to set boundaries with people who clearly aren't friends to you and your relationship and if your gf is unwilling or unable to do that, I'd seriously consider just moving on. Don't stay in a relationship with someone you can't trust. This is too much drama IMO for such a young relationship. It's not worth it."
Porn isn't usually an issue in relationships as long as it isn't taking the priority over actual physical intimacy with your partner. That's not happening here. Make it clear to your bf that he needs to meet your physical intimacy needs or that you're gonna move on from your relationship. It's unfair to you that he is prioritizing watching porn over having sex with you.
"It sucks, but the very real problem is this. If she lives in the United States, and especially if she lives in an at-will state, then it doesn't matter what her desires are, or if she's a man or a woman, or how sexist it is, or how wrong it is, (AND IT IS), sometimes in situations like this, a boss can make your life a living hell, and eventually fire you. Sure, everyone knows that they be firing you for blatant sexism and retaliation. But in an at-will state, how are you going to prove it? If she's late with a single report, the boss can just point to that report. The boss is already micromanaging her outside of work, who knows what kind of documentation he's already be compiling against her at work? If she's ever come in 5 minutes late, the boss may have that scribbled down, and could say that she came in drunk. He's already hinted at her a ton of times that he doesn't want to smell booze on her breath. He's already creating that case.

This is the sad fact of working in the United States. Companies have rights, workers don't."
Thank you so much for sharing your experience. 
"Yes I'm well aware of that! I don't think I need a ""Not all men"" disclaimer, but thank you."
"This is a good summary.  While most relationships can be fixed with work, OP has a lemon.

Solution: dump him."
"I think oftentimes people *believe* they have learned from their prior experiences, but they've never really done the work to get past whatever personal psychological programming got them to where they were in the first place. It takes a lot of work that most people never do. 

I found that Psych Today article pretty pitiful honestly - for a woman who has talked until she's blue in the face about what the issues with the marriage are only to have nothing change, how the hell long should she wait? If I have to threaten to divorce you for you to act like a decent human being, then the relationship was a mistake to begin with."
"This is him. This is not some stranger that body snatched your BF.
All of these things are him demonstrating exactly who he is: immature, selfish, self-centered, and emotionally manipulative. I think a lot is revealed when you travel together, because traveling can be stressful, and people show who they really are when they are stressed.

So if this was a guy you didn't know, that you were just hanging out with for a week, is this someone you would say: ""Hey I'd really like to get to know him better and potentially date him.""? 

Or is this someone you would run far away from?

"
"He’s choosing to believe someone else over you, without hesitation. Your relationship is garbage anyway. Your partner should always believe you unless there’s a damn good reason not to. "
"I was also on the other side of this, but it was 5 years ago now. We were 15-16 when she ghosted us. She was one of my best friends.

We all didn't really understand at all. At first we were worried sick about her, then as time went on and we saw her around from time to time (she always avoided us), we grew angry that she wouldn't so much as leave one message that she needed space, or that her mother wouldn't fill us in at all. It was like she was wiped off the face of the earth and nobody told us or cared how it would affect us. As her best friends, we had to essentially grieve for her.

Now we're all that bit older and I think we all understand why it happened a bit more, but we still haven't talked to her since. She's made other friends now with other people we went to school with, and we're all happy for her, but it's clear she doesn't want anything to do with us.

All that said, if she ever reached out, we'd be delighted to see her again. So I guess my point is, it's never a bad idea to reach out. "
"If you're just vaguely ""afraid"" of moving because it's new and a change and you have some negative stereotypes, I would vote for giving it a chance! I also grew up in the Midwest and was very much uninterested in ever moving. My husband tells me he clearly remembers me telling him early on in our relationship that I would NEVER consider moving to his country of birth. Well, fast-forward a few years, we visited said country for holidays and to see his family, ended up moving here on trial because of ease with jobs, housing, visas, etc...and I'm so glad we did, because I absolutely love it here. I had a lot of negative impressions of the city as well, but we ended up finding a house in a spot that's actually super homey, fun neighborhood street, open space and nature, no noise or crowds, and actually has everything I loved about growing up in suburban midwest but with all the convenience of bigger city life nearby. My husband being able to get a much better job here, many more opportunities to utilize his talents, better salary, great hours and the chance to work mainly from home (plus I just so happened to find a much more amazing job here as well), all that has also greatly contributed to quality of life especially as we began having kids.

All that to say, I think I understand your reluctance about moving, because I was the same, but I ended up loving my moved-to spot even more than I ever imagined. So if you're up for it, I think I'd vote for going for a tour of Tucson, visiting and checking out where you could possibly live, and then giving it a try for a while if it works out with the job. It sounds like your husband would be understanding about moving back again if things really don't suit you? But you might also just be pleasantly surprised! "
"Even after the break up she's still being controlling and putting you down.Block her. change your locks. Before you block her make it very clear she is not to contact you otherwise you will contact authorities, send via text so you have proof. Willing to bet she will try to contact you within 3-6 months again"
For a moment there I thought you'd made her yoghurt or something. :P

"It has it's limits. I for one would also think a 22 year old and a 30 year old is kind of creepy, I think at 30 a 5 year age difference is the max I'd be comfortable with. 

And the older you go the worse the formula is. I'm 33 and if some 50-year-old was hitting on me I would be suuuuuuuuuper creeped out by it."
"""hey babe, can I see that old pic of your dad again? I was at that family/friend's party and I think he looks a lot like someone I know."" Would be an option of how to approach the conversation."
Honestly I am completely 100% not interested in spending any time with that baby. I know technically he is my nephew but I just couldn’t bring myself to be an aunt to him knowing how he was brought into this world. I’m definitely pursuing therapy though. Thanks
It's probably the first obvious decision she's made without consulting mama first.
"Your wife and family vs. this friend. Pick one.

Are there no other options for celebrating your birthday with Julia? Maybe a dinner or outing where your wife can be...yanno, included?"
"It's your child, you are entitled to set boundaries, but I think you need to realize that you are basically clueless right now about what caring for a newborn is like. You're turning down help before you even know if you're going to need it, and I think that's a mistake. It's funny how your definition of ""necessary"" help changes when you haven't showered in three days, the house is a mess, and you haven't slept for longer than 3 hours in weeks. Basically, don't get cocky about how you've got this newborn thing. Your attitude may bite you in the ass."
"Don't try to do it at work. Ask her out to lunch. Your treat. Be calm and positive and point out every red flag. Then say, if I am overreacting how about we check it out. Check your joint account balance. Check your work visa balance. Search his Dad to see if he lives in Italy and call him to see of there was a plan to visit.

Tell her she doesn't have to do any of that, that you will drop it right now and never bring it up again, but that you are concerned and love her and would feel better if you knew the answers to these questions. Maybe lie and blame it on yourself, saying you knew someone before who was financially ruined by a boyfriend (ex. Aunt of Friend)."
"How would you like to be thanked? 

Your family should thank him together."
"He literally doesn't have instagram or facebook or anything!
He's all about videogames and discord.

But I called him and we spoke. He promised not to call me that and actually remembers my name. So thats something I took off my chest."
"If you ended your friendship because of his toxicity then actually end it. Stop talking, stop hanging, block everywhere."
"3 month supply for $120? Holy shit, that is a major ripoff."
"Ok I'd like to alter my answer - OP if she was playing with your hair she's probably into you, if she was petting you like a dog it's because your head feels fuzzy"
It sounds like he has actual disdain for you. 
"Moving in together is the new ""marriage,"" a huge test of your compatibility and problem solving skills. Just like you shouldn't rush into marriage, you shouldn't rush into living together. It will generally go better the longer you've been together, the more stable you are as a couple, the more you understand each other and your own weaknesses.

Nothing about what you've said is a red flag to me, but it's one of those situations where it won't hurt anything to wait."
Break up with your boyfriend *before* dating other guys. 
"""Dad, I would like to express my appreciation for all the times you let me use your vehicles. As you know, there were times when I was struggling and really didn't have other options. However the fact that I previously used yours does not unequivocally mean you are entitled to use ours. Using your car occasionally to bring my kids places is nowhere near using a brand new vehicle - one that is very important to us - for a cross-country trip. I'm afraid our answer is 'no'.""

Or, just say no and stick to it. As others have said 'no' is a complete sentence.  "
"Yes, he has occasionally done coke with his friends, or things like acid. Never around me though. I do not like it. "
"That's such a good method, if he can say these things with a straight face you know he doesn't care about you."
"Why are you offended by this? Really dig deep and try to find the source of your discomfort.

Personally I think you're overreacting. Your girlfriend said she liked this guy's glasses and he seemed familiar. Why does that seem disrespectful to you? That's a comment (and equivalents) I have heard many, *many* people in relationships say. It's not like she said she would ""do him"", or that he was super hot, etc etc. It's an innocent compliment."
"Disclaimer: Only you know if you have in fact been a great husband to her, but I'm taking your word for it that you make her feel beautiful and are at least reasonably attentive towards her

&gt; she denied initially but when I showed the actual messages to her she went on how she felt like she didn’t get any attention from me and that it didn’t even seem like I cared about her anymore

I wouldn't trust her as far as I could throw her. When you spoke to her about it she immediately got defensive and started putting the blame back on you. If she's mentioned being unhappy before then that's one thing but it sounds like she's never mentioned being unhappy. This is not the way to deal with issues in the relationship.

It sounds to me a little bit that she's high maintenance and requires more attention than the average person and now that the kids are taking up more of your time she is seeking this attention from elsewhere.  This is not fair to you.

The next thing is she's a stay at home mother. Are you now going to be confident that in the 8-10 hours she's home alone that she's not inviting some of these snapchat friends around?

All is not lost here, but it can't be her blaming you. She needs to accept fault in what's happened and show genuine interest in making this right"
As much as. Not more so.
"You should not move in with this man. Six months is kind of fast for cohabitation in general, but he’s making it so abundantly clear he isn’t ready. "
What's all your furniture pointed at?!?!?!
"You may be being a bit paranoid here.  You were nearby with your other daughter, you had a good idea of where she was.  You met both the person she was with AND his parents beforehand, and this kid goes to the same school as her...so somewhat a known quantity.

It was about as ideal a circumstance as you could have for a situation like this and is good for establishing life skills for your children to be functional adults without parents hovering around at every turn.

7pm to 9:30 is a safe and reasonable time in most areas.  I think most of the other posts are spot on that your wife is pissed that she ""missed"" this and wasn't involved but is over-reacting and trying to gaslight you into thinking you did something majorly wrong to justify her being so angry at being excluded."
did you even read the post? OP said that she's talked to the kid and the parent about the behavior multiple times before. Like the fact that she has expressed this to both of them multiple times and nothing has changed is the whole point. 
"My man, So many stories come by about women in relationships with emotionally abusive husbands or boyfriends, who take advantage of them. They are all very sad stories and I wish those women the best of luck in moving on and finding a better man.

You are a man, with a very emotionally abusive wife. My advice to you is the same, you deserve better, no one should say that kind of stuff to you and I hope you come to realize you should be treated much better than you are. The situations are no different.

Of course no one on reddit knows your exact situation, so take your own opinions into account, but if you're finding yourself pointing out the one thing she did last week which made you smile among the tens of times she made you feel like crap... Find a good lawyer and move on."
"It's an unfortunately common misconception among some groups. I've heard stories about an actual politician who used to rant and rave to his employees about how there were tampons and pads in the bathroom which were described as ""sex toys."" It took a campaign manager in the middle of a meeting needing to excuse themselves to change out and another fit before it was explained that if she didn't, she would bleed all over the meeting room chairs, and no, she couldn't just hold it in like urine before it finally sunk in."
"I'm not invalidating her health issues. I'm sure they're real. I'm just saying that it's unfair for her to force you to not do things you want to do because of her health issues. And, if the anti-anxiety meds make her sleepy, isn't that a good thing for a flight? Why wouldn't she just take a pill before the plane so she could just sleep on the flight?"
Why would you EVER even consider giving this another shot? Come on girl!
"There's a good chance she's cheating on you too. 

A 1k/mo allowance, and you're out of the house from 6-midnight every day. And she's training and going to meets. Meeting trainers and fellow competitors. "
"&gt; sigh, well she is, but i mean I'm not bad looking myself. I've dated girls hotter than her.

I feel like a lot of people go ""lol your girl must be hot"" when men post about their abusive girlfriends or wives.  Obviously you know that's not why you stayed with her.  You're getting good advice in this thread, but once you sort out the immediate shit you really ought to look at the emotional reasons you stayed with somebody who treated you this way. "
Leave the trash at the curb where it belongs.
In this thread: op incapable of simultaneously having friends and a GF
"That's the thing though. I've only been noticing that he's depressed, but that's about it. Like I said, he's working a job right now that does a lot physically which could explain his weight loss. I asked him to ask his doctor to make sure everything is okay. We smoke pot together, but it's mostly for sleep because we both of sleep issues (he worked at nights for 6 years and I was diagnosed with Insomnia when I was 18) and he hasn't shown interest in other drugs that I know of. "
"This reply gave me a much needed laugh, thank you. "
"&gt;Well, he's addicted to something near or having to do with that shopping center. Whether it's the uber driver bringing him there, a waitress at a diner there, a glory hole somewhere, boozing it up on his lunch break at a bar there, a masseuse at a shady massage parlor, underground cock fighting ring, simply meeting someone else at a halfway point on their lunch break too, or something else, he has a problem. 

This is the answer. Ask him to turn on location sharing on his phone. He lost his right to privacy when he spent $1000 on being shady, wouldn’t come clean  and continued to doubt after you spoke about it. 
"
"Just speaking from my personal experience...

Was in a similar situation as you, passed up on a lucrative job opportunity post-grad after listening to my S/O's POV. 
Back then my mind told me to take it up, my heart told me to give it a pass for the sake of our R/S.

Turns out it became one of my bigger regrets in life, me and my S/O ended up not working out (unfortunately), and I found myself set back a couple of years (had to get an entry level job and work my way up).

Like you mentioned in your post you've been struggling to get a job despite good credentials and now a good job opportunity comes along...I would suggest not to pass it up, opportunities like these don't come by often. 
"
"I'm gonna go ahead and suggest you don't demand your partner coddle your every irrational, jealous feeling and use them as a method to control your partner. I'm gonna go ahead and suggest it's a common tactic of toxic people to act as if their every feeling is the centre of the universe and *must* be validated and treated with deadly seriousness by the people around them, no matter how irrational and selfish those feelings are, and that their partner needs to take responsibility for those feelings and organise around making them all better by giving into their demands. Also, ""too much free time"", lol. I'm guessing you don't see the irony there."
"You find guys in the 20-25 age range attractive because you, yourself, are in that age range.  You're probably interested in guys at the lower end of that range because you're not interested in a relationship right now and, normally, neither are they.  You're not ""getting old."" There's no need to worry about becoming a cougar.  Do what you want."
"If you're not ready to marry after four years, you likely will never marry this girl. It's not fair to her or you to stay in a relationship like that."
"&gt; feel like I failed as a father.

hahaha oh you poor misguided soul."
Make sure you hide all of the keys to your durango so that they can't just take them and steal the car.   This is an incredibly inappropriate thing for your father to ask of you.  Say no and stand strong.
Or send to a friend as a screenshot for them to save. Hell send to me and I’ll save it on my phone if need be. GET OUT ASAP. This behavior is the start of a abuser/ family killer. Women and their children are murdered everyday from these types. People may think I’m being over dramatic but I’ve seen this too many times.  Get out get out get out. 
"&gt;Was it childish to warn my sister's friend when she started dating him? 

No, it was the right thing to do.

&gt;Should I have kept out of it or was it okay for me to get involved?

No, it was the right thing to do.

&gt;Do I really owe him an apology?

No, it was the right thing to do. 

&gt;They think that it's childish and that I need to apologize and then leave him alone.

Tell them you'll apologize for nothing, and that they choose to stick up for someone who physically, emotionally, and sexually abused you says more than enough about their own character. Tell them to eff off."
"I've been through the same thing as you too. I live in a different country to my family and it had been bothering me that it was always me initiating contact. Even when I lived in the same country, it was the same experience. I don't think they care because I haven't spoken to them verbally (on the phone or video call) in over 6 months. My Mum complains when she has to phone her Dad and he doesn't call her and then when I point out the hypocrisy of her statement, she's like, 'Well you're out of sight, out of mind.' At Christmas, we'd planned to Skype each other. I told them I wouldn't be organising it because they needed to make the effort for once and I'd be waiting for their video call. I sat there on Xmas Eve waiting by my computer.... and they never called nor sent a message to say they were cancelling. I spent Christmas Day with my ex's family who treat me more like a daughter than my own parents do and then sent my family a message saying I was done with them, that I was pissed at how they treat me, that they never make an effort. It was very cathartic to get it all out. 

So now I feel like there should be 'Reddit orphan' meet-ups at Christmas where Redditors who are disappointed with their family or just don't have any family can all meet up and have a Christmas with people suffering the same fate."

"Even so, having some actual work experience on a Resume makes finding the next job so much easier in most industries. So even if this company sucks and goes out of business, it's still providing some income until that point, and would help break through the ""no experience"" barrier of finding the first position in a career path.

IDK, maybe I'm projecting, but I struggled so hard with finding my first career position right out of school. If someone had offered me a job I wanted with salary and benefits, I can't imagine turning that down."
"I was going to say, based on the first bit, that you CAN'T be done. that you can't be falling so out of love after a year of marriage unless you got married when you really, really shouldn't have.  Especially with the baby, as that changes so much stuff, and so often you just want to chill out and do your own thing.

then I read this:
&gt;Last week on his way home from work he asked me if he could go out and have a hall pass. I was 100% sure he was joking so I said ""Sure, use protection"" and laughed. Then he didn't come home. When he was just a little bit late, I called him and asked where he was. He said on his way out for drinks and to use his hall pass. He had been 100% serious. I was heartbroken. When he realized I had not really given him permission, he came straight home. I can't believe he was serious.

WTF.  Like, wtf.    "
"First, you apologize. You tell her how sorry you are that you hurt her with your insecurities. Next, you need to show her that you are committed to changing. Going to therapy to address your insecurities is one way to do that."
"Sounds more like a fetish than him cheating on you. 

If you see a long term future with him - one thing that MAY be of concern is how it would effect you if he ended up getting caught during his public escapades. It would be a major thorn in the side to be married to someone on the sex offender registry. "
"You need to really think about why you're so willing to stay with a partner who's ok with this sort of cheating. Honestly, I wouldn't be able to trust a partner who could hide this sort of secret and condone the cheating and at the very least, I'd get some premarital counseling with your fiancee to see if you can get on the same page. But, IMO, you should stop protecting the cheaters. It's unfair for them to have put this secret on you and you should do what you think is right. "
"Do you graduate this year? Or next

My advice for this entire situation (not just this incident) is that you just keep your head down and get out ASAP. 

I grew up in a broken family, with a mother that was very argumentative, liked to ‘poke’ and could never let an argument go. So less than 5 years ago, I found a live in nanny job a couple months before I finished highschool and moved out the day I graduated. You’re not going to win this one. Put up with the crap and make plans to get out. You’ll be happier and better off. 

Now when I see my mother and get into arguments, I just leave immediately. I have no obligation to her if she won’t treat me with respect. She pays none of my bills, I don’t live on her home, so now we are equals. If she doesn’t want to behave appropriately, then she doesn’t get to see me. I have left within minutes of showing up. 

Sorry about the makeup, maybe ask your friends if they have any spare makeup (just no eye products.) and yes, document this. Take photos. "
"Identical (male) twin here who's 31.

First of all, obviously it sound much worse to be a woman. Males don't get as much ""sexual creeper"" jokes, twin or not. Especially the twin women archetype like that dumb budweiser ad ""and the twins"". You're probably at least somewhat attractive too, which would give you even more attention and sexual commentary.

That said, yeah it was more common in high school. We looked closer alike and so you can become known as 'the twins.' I work with some twins now at my office --- no I can't tell them apart. Is it because it's hard? No, of course not. It's because we don't work closely together and thus I don't really care. If someone gives a shit and knows you well, obviously they know you as a distinct person. They'll make a point to remember differences.

In college and beyond as we have our own lives, not many people give a shit. But still, when we're together, we will get the ""twin"" comment a lot. Are you guys twins?? That's asked all the fucking time. I usually say no. Because the question is annoying. It's like going up to a black guy and saying ARE YOU BLACK??

I don't find it that unusual for people you're sleeping with even to make a dumb joke. Like Oh You're a twin?? Cool there's two of you!! Double sex at once haha!! (few women have implied as such).

Like no, it's not two of me, it's me and my BROTHER, fuckwad. Do you want to have sexual relations with your sibling? That said, girls (I'm sleeping with) usually can tell it's not supremely funny and back off.

Hell, girls get pissy if you mention Oh it would be cool to sleep with your friend Stacy. Let alone their sister. So yeah I think they get the message pretty quick.

EDIT: That said, I knew one girl who did fuck a pair of twin brothers, apparently. Not at once but like, they were all living together. All I can say is ... wow. Fucked up family.
"
"I've noticed a lot of parents are all about that performative parent life. Disappear for 18 years, show up when the kid goes to college for engineering, never offer to help with college, pretend there was some sort of regretful situation and they wanna make amends the moment you're successful.

I've got several friends who's family was suddenly $o clo$e the moment they got marginally self-sufficient and owned their own house, car, etc."
And be damned grateful for her help. 
"GodDAMMit, you made me spray coffee on my keyboard!"
"&gt; You should have told her about your intention to do so months ago before your son was even born.

No, he should have talked about his intention to do it before she agreed to have children with him, so that she could make an informed decision if she wanted to have kids within a relationship with that level of trust in it."
This brought back fond memories. My living room table was a cardboard box for months 
She clearly states that she held his drink while he went to the toilet - so I don’t think it’s likely his drink was spiked :/
"Eating food in bear county definitely counts as ""unsafe"" behavior. Do you want to get attacked by a bear because your boyfriend was afraid of a little chill?"

"PREACH. 

/u/Throwawaycampy , please read this. You don't have to put up with this shit."
"Grab something plain that there's no reason to expect is special to him - even if it's wrinkled or ratty, it's only for two blocks. Then change when you're home, and send him a text about what you did, that you'll have his stuff clean and back to him ASAP, that you had a nice time last night, are sorry you had a bit too much to drink, and will plan better for the next time. Something along those lines. If he gets upset for any reason, that'll be telling, because there's nothing in there that should upset a reasonable person given your situation."
4 friends is double the amount I have at 28. The rest are just old aquantences now. Op is rich socially if she can cut these women out and still have 4.
Imagine if he maintained a friendship with a high school girlfriend who wishes he had married her instead of you. Imagine if that made him feel trapped in his current marriage to you. How would you feel about that? Would the fact that their genitals hadn't touched yet make everything okay?
You didn't ruin anything. You're just with a selfish person. You can do better!
"(1) Paying your bills doesn’t mean he gets to completely disregard your feelings and relationship. 

(2) It sounds like he is getting resentful for having to pay your way. If he agreed to doing it and it’s not working you may need to sit down and talk out alternatives. 

(3) If no compromise can be made I wouldn’t stick around. His attitude will undoubtedly get worse over time. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this. You deserve someone who will make you feel special and wanted.

P.S. That whole conversation about you going to treatment makes him sound like a narcissist. If you are seeing that attitude as a pattern RUN. He will never see your side and he will gaslight you until you have a full on breakdown. "
"Yep.  I had a large layover in Vegas once so I went and played some blackjack.  Some of my friends commented how irresponsible it was for me to gamble, but I didn't think so.  I kept myself under $20 (I lost the $20, and then just returned to the airport and read my book), and considered it entertainment.  If I had won... I eventually would have probably still lost that $20 chasing more wins, or stopped when I needed to leave for my flight.

Never gamble more than you can easily lose.  For me it was $20 and I enjoy blackjack.  It's restraint and moderation.  Would I do it again?  In a heartbeat.  But I know when to stop.  OP's finace clearly has problems if he was fronting cash he wasn't willing to lose to begin with."
Your MIL is amazing. Don’t let your sister ruin it!
"Which by the sound of it, neither is she. "
"I know about the need for bottle feeding and had bought all the supplies for the kitten. I had 2 kittens myself when I was younger, both were 1 week old and abandoned. I prepared to take care of the kitten we adopted as best as I could and now all those supplies are just a constant reminder of how she got thrown out in the street.

Yes, I’m somewhat relieved to be aware of this side of them since I always perceived them to be normal, a bit cold, but normal."
"You’re right there’s nothing left to say. You’ve explained things and he refuses to accept it.

Time to just move on. "
"Woah. OK first off you are young and all of this happened only months ago. You really need to get therapy and cut contact with both of them so that you can heal from this traumatic experience (even if it upsets your family). I also think it is WAY too soon for you to be in another relationship right now. You need to be alone and process all of the pain and trauma you have experienced and continue to experience every time she updates her facebook.

"
" You know what to do. PM if you need help with safety planning, I do that for a living. 

"
"I don’t think you have much of a reason to be upset at anything other than him lying. I can see from his side why he did too, getting my ex pregnant and the fallout after would not be something I would openly discuss with my current GF, unless I was the one who initiated the discussion. That is not something he NEEDED to share with you. "
"No, you should give him the space he asked for. This isn't a slight towards you, and you're not a bad girlfriend/friend/person for wanting to help - but he asked you to give him space, and you should respect that. If he needs help, let him ask. Again, this is not a slight towards you, it's what HE asked you to do. "
"It sounds like you are thinking clearly and being smart.  I encourage you to do it by text, not phone.  If you phone, he will have a chance to shout, yell, cry, bargain, etc.  Don't give him the chance to try to manipulate you.  And definitely stay with your parents!

Thanks...it was very hard to end that engagement, but I have never regretted it for one second.  I'm getting married in 39 days to the most wonderful, sweet, gentle, amazing man and I wouldn't have been free to date him had I not called off the bad relationship.

I also encourage you to get some counseling after the break up.  It really helps to talk to someone who isn't emotionally involved, who can help you process it, work through the behaviors and thought patterns you've learned while being with him, and come out stronger and better."
"Yeah, to me this would be indicative of an actual character flaw in him. It isn't a coincidence he continually seeks out women he has an experience/power advantage over or are otherwise more naive or easily controlled than a woman his age would be. I think it is the definition of predatory to purposely seek out easy targets because of their vulnerability, and what a coincidence he's the type of guy to have anger issues too. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is probably a duck. 

The reason he gets mad is because he knows it is wrong. Without getting into how much of a red flag it is for a partner to immediately default to anger when their behavior is brought into question (common way to maintain control), the fact he can't see why his actions are wrong is equally concerning. **Why** does he seek out these young women? Could it be because a 20 year old is more easily kept in line or impressed/swayed than an experienced 34 year old woman? Hm."
"Seconding this as best advice. They may have deserved it, but OP just trashed the long game. As the bigger people (sorry, it sucks), the onus is on you to control yourself so as to support the bottom line (continued contact with younger sister). You done fucked up, OP. 

That said, it doesn't sound like your gf has healthy boundaries in place to help her keep her sanity while she enacts this long game. That's therapy work, you should encourage her to go. Good luck. Savor the righteous indignation you have now, being the bigger person means you never get much of that :-/"
"I also use same bc as my sister after trying sooo many, and no problems so I second this! (Also, hate to be that person but it’s ‘voilà’ not ‘wa-lah’- it’s French!)"
"So he's using the income disparity as a control tactic to block a valuable option for couples in your situation? Putting this together with his physically aggressive actions of boxing you in and then flipping the script to make you the problem makes me awfully uneasy. This relationship doesn't sound terribly healthy for you, OP. 

Have you ever looked at LoveIsRespect.org? (Sorry, we can't link on this sub.) The information is reliable and there are quizzes to help you as well. "
Run. The only men at that age who date women in their 20’s are the kinds who want to manipulate and control. He is literally abusing you with this behavior. 
"you have saved yourself from a horrible, flaming wreck, trust me. my dad was an alcoholic for my entire childhood (and most of my adult life) and it was fucking *hell*. My sister and I both have serious psychological problems from growing up like that. Love is NOT enough."

"I would say it's time for couples counseling. Some individual therapy and maybe that needs to lead into eventual sex therapy. To be honest, I'm really fascinated by this post, you're claiming to be so deeply in love with her, but yet you can't really seem to show it physically. Almost seems as though you have a very unique love language. I really hope things work out for you and if you can update us cause this is really unique. "
Boom. This right here
"In your hypothetical, it would surely depend on *why* your husband was uncomfortable. In the case provided, we are talking about an ex from the best part of a decade ago in teenage years, and OP suggests that the wife's dislike of Alicia is a broader reflection of the wife rather than Alicia's behaviour toward her.

More to the point: Alicia has just struck tragedy the likes of which most of us will never face and she will never recover completely from. Of course the OP should drop everything in this circumstance.  He's also at pains to point out that he *did* try and contact his wife, multiple times."
Just because you cheat doesn't mean everyone does.
"Its weird to have rando hookups at a wedding, but it's not weird to have a very close friend who you had sex with once, and then continued to have a non-sexual friendly relationship with for years afterwards, who is also happy and in their own committed relationship.  This isn't some chick he picked up at a party and banged in the toilets, this is his friend who he happened to have had sex with once a long time ago when they were both young and single."
"Statutory rape is generally governed by a specific difference in ages, or in some jurisdictions to indicate that a “willing” participant is unable to legally consent."
"So when me and her met she was dating her ex and I guess she kinda emotionally cheated on him with me, even though I tried to make boundaries with her and be friends with her bf at the time. 

I don’t think she would physically cheat on me she just gets emotionally attached to people."
"&gt; We didn't have relationships before so I guess this is what happens when you mix two nerds

No, it's not.  My husband and I are both super nerds.  I do majority of the cleaning, he does majority of the cooking.  Sometimes one of us is in the middle of something (like a game) and wants to eat dinner apart.  Sometimes, we eat dinner together.  Neither of us forces the other one to have sex if they aren't in the mood and we both make sure the other is into it before escalating things (quickies are fun sometimes, but they only work if you're willing to use lube or were already turned on enough to go for it).

&gt; He just takes and takes and he genuinely thinks I'm the problem. 

This is your real issue.  He's selfish.  *Maybe* you're not communicating properly.  I'd be willing to bet he's just not willing to listen."
She just isn’t into you bro. She likes the attention of MULTIPLE other men. Move on. 
"Maybe he's right to do so though? 

And the absolute numbers wouldn't be very meaningful, they should subtract their previous housing cost. 

I suspect that OP will see that she isn't actually saving them any money with this situation. Hopefully having the same understanding of the finances between the two of them can lead to productive conversation."
"They fired you for being a shitty manager who couldn't control his subordinates and causing problems for HR to deal with.
Anyway. It's not looking good right now. How soon are you getting married? Is it booked and paid for? Who's paying? Depending on some of these answers, you should consider postponing the wedding until you are in a better position."
"You should stop trying to contact him and instead contact a therapist. 

He's not your boyfriend you shouldn't rely on him to be your emotional support. 

Seeing a therapist will help you be your own person and not rely on someone who won't be there for you. "

WTF does this accomplish? There's a 99% chance this would escalate into an unproductive argument. 
"This is a valid criticism indeed and I hate that people blow it off so simply. I take medication for epilepsy that is also used to tread mental health issues. If I didn’t stop me spazzing out I would take it. It’s like it completely changes your personality, makes it feel more sad and angery then you normally do and there’s just a general all around fuzziness in your head like it’s too cloudy all the time. Like you can’t think and see as clearly as you normally do, not enough to impair you of anything but enough to make you notice. Takes years to really get thru the side effects. "
"A few things:  you’re 24 and called your mom to pick you up after a date while the girl was still there?  Dude, big turn off.

You should have made your moves during the movie while it’s dark

Also, never go to a movie on a first date.  You can’t talk during the movie, and honestly, going to a movie during a first date means you’ve been friendzoned."
"It seems the poster you responded to thinks yes, his life is not his own. The wife is dictating their future and saying she’ll end the marriage if she doesn’t get her way.

"I read the ""she thinks she has PCOS"" quite a lot. I have PCOS and let me tell you, getting a diagnosis is really simple, it only takes an internal ultrasound during your regular gynecologist visit. 

Regardless of the diagnosis, she could talk with her doctor, if she wanted to, about her libido and they can definitely make some suggestions. 

What's concerning is the way she's dismissing you and kind of guilt tripping you for wanting to have sex. I think there's a communication issue  here. Maybe you need to sit her down and have a calm dialog about your needs in a relationship. Ask her if her needs are being met  and then talk about yours. Ask her about her health because it's just really odd that she doesn't know if she has PCOS or not. Ask her if increasing her libido is something she'd want. If she doesn't, maybe you need to reconsider the relationship. "
You're the backup guy. The guy she's only with because she can't convince the other guy to be with her... yet. Don't settle for being the consolation prize with this woman when you could be someone else's top choice.
"Who said anything about conservatives? You're equating a life choice (smoking pot) with an uncontrolled physical reaction (people who feel sick when they smell pot). You are painting people who have an adverse reaction to a smell, as them making a choice to feel that way (newsflash: It isn't a choice) and lumping them as 'judgmental and conservatives.'

You're the one who sounds judgmental.

Weed smells bad. Sorry, but it does. To me, it smells way worse than cigarette smoke or tobacco in general. There's a reason it's called dank. For some people, the smell is bad enough to give them nausea. I also don't like the smell. I actually developed an intolerance to the smell after a bad experience. I don't care what people do recreationally in their own space, but being around the smell for me would be a dealbreaker for me. That's not you being persecuted, it would be the same for people who smoke tobacco in public, etc."
"Jfc why are you married to him? He sounds too immature and selfish for a relationship by throwing around the word ""divorce"" to get what he wants and pushing his creepy insecurities onto you. You two have an excellent combined income, but he seems to have a habit of dropping a LOT of money on dumb things and then quitting immediately... even if you had a higher salary, I'm pretty sure he'd still complain about the farm because he's ""over it"" just like his many other hobbies. 

Your girlfriends are hearing how distressed this guy is making you after only *two years* and are too scared to tell you to get out. Do NOT abandon your dreams for someone who doesn't even treat you right. "
"If you’re disgusted by baby bellies then you have no business making babies. 

Edit: And so disgusted by baby bellies that you can’t hold your wife’s hand at that. Just, no. If you can’t get over your weird baby belly issue enough to hold your pregnant wife’s hand then you’re not qualified for parenthood. There’s so much shit that you have to just get over, especially during those early years. You don’t get to opt out of the downright gross parts."

"Yep, and he only divulged more info once she sent the screencaps from the security footage. Stay broken up"

YES.

"Oh it's not 1.3K split 3 ways, it's 1.3K each haha. Yeah I think I'll mention the bed bugs for sure, just to be safe but ultimately it's up to them, I've already made a decision"
"&gt; It's more of a ""I know this will get to her"" sort of thing.

Which is not conducive behaviour for a healthy relationship. His actions were very deliberate. 

It’s true that we don’t know if he said sorry or not (Could you clarify, u/dpe2), but what is clear is that he was trying to minimise his behaviour by insisting it wasn’t disrespectful, (which it was. Spitting is disrespectful in virtually any context, and he admitted to doing it because he found her behaviour annoying). 

Even being really generous with this guy’s motivations, I still think this is break-up worthy. "
"Yeah it sounds like he's himself up for failure. Like he's probably struggling on living on the diet and since it isn't too far from what you normally eat, he can't believe that this is all that you are eating and that you must be cheating on the diet elsewhere and if he can find proof of that then he can add those cheat meals into his own diet."
"This was my immediate thought as well. relocating to the city should be a serious option. OP can continue to work on her professional growth but also have some personal time to relax. Its not just about her relationships, she also has to make sure she is taking care of herself mentally and not pushing herself too hard. Coming home and eating dinner, then going to bed, does not sound like a fun week!"
"You should call her out on it in a polite way. Be like, ""You did me a favor, so you can keep the profit, but next time, just be honest about it.""

Good for you! And I mean that very sincerely. I saw in another comment he already tried to guilt you about sending him money during this talk. Be prepared that he will likely continue to do that if you keep talking to him and don’t cut off contact.  I know it doesn’t feel like you’ll ever find someone else you connect with but please believe that you will and completely get rid of this loser. 
"""I clearly stated that I wasn't sure if we would ever get back together, but that I needed at least 6 months to decide."""

"I can see your wife's point. You want to have quality couple time together, but then [it appears] you didn't make any suggestions of things to do together. She has made quite a few suggestions and you turned them all down. She was extending an olive branch to you and you didn't take it. This is her time to relax, so I understand her not wanting to plan it. What are things you both enjoy doing together? Could you pick out a movie on netflix to watch? Are the suggestions she came up with things that you really can't do once in a while? Sometimes it's a compromise and you do something that you don't *really* enjoy doing because you know your partner likes to do it."
"&gt;I disagree, its fucking weird.

"You were at the house of a friend you knew at the time.  If he was worried about you passing out in the cold he would have taken you back into the house you were at, not his own house.

"&gt;This had been a great experience for you - people are going to try and con you left right and centre in the business you have chosen.

Absolute truth. Something that every professional artist (and freelancers in every field) has to learn is that most ""exposure"" is effectively worthless. It almost never leads to an increase in paid work. Anyone trying to get you to do professional work in exchange for exposure is asking you to work for free and they're either completely uniformed (so their word of mouth is meaningless) or actively trying to exploit you. Professionals get paid.

"This is  hard one b/c it crosses the friend and into the financial, and whenever money is involved..especially if you do not have it..it gets awkward.

But it's her birthday, and she's a good friend, and apparently, your presence means a lot to her..so, even though you're uncomfortable with her paying, I'd let her.

The alternative is for you to go out with her separately, if that would work..but if not, again, b/c it's her b'day..It might be best for you to swallow your pride and let her pay."

"Have you always had an open marriage or did this occur later in the marriage? It sounds like you aren't happy with your sex life and wanted women who are into what you want sexually. She doesn't want other partners. Maybe I'm just not up to date on the open relationship rules but my understanding is that it only works when both partners want it and are comfortable with it. The only people I've ever known this to work for had an awesome relationship with a huge amount of trust and love. Even t hen they only do the 'open' part once in a while. It isn't a constant thing. Its very obvious your wife isn't happy. If the sex on the side is more important to you keep doing what you're doing and prepare for the possible consequences. You aren't bringing it up to your wife but I don't buy your reasoning. I think you aren't brining it up because you don't want the answer, not to 'avoid causing a problem.' You already know how she feels. "

"I got reeeaaaally agitated when reading this because something very similar happened to me. When I was in my final year of animation course my uncle asked me to make a 15 second advertisement for his company. Now, anyone who knows even a little bit about 3D animation will know that it takes a *team* of at least 4-5 people and at least 2 months to complete a video from scratch and when I say scratch I mean all I had was a logo and some knowledge of his products. One person can't possibly make a script, be a storyboard artist, modeler, texturer, animator, rigger, lighter, renderer and compositor all at once ffs! Of course these words mean nothing to someone who knows jack shit about animation. So I asked my classmates for help and we formed a team of 4 and were promised a *generous* 100 pounds each. Being students and shockingly decent at time management we were able to put aside a couple of hours every day for this project. After sending him raw drafts like render stills and blocked animation, they were always met with ""What the fuck is this shit? It's such bad quality! I'm not paying you to play on the computer all day! What's the point in paying for tuition if your skill so poor?"" I kept trying to explain the process but after about 6 weeks of this he completely blew up at me and accused me of robbing him (I never got paid) and wasting his time (he okay'ed the 2 month deadline) I eventually broke down and finally told my parents who absolutely exploded on him and there was a huge divide in our families. I had to apologise to my friends and my lovely parents treated everyone dinner. My only regret is that I didn't tell my parents what was happening from the get go. I haven't spoken to my uncle for 2 years and he still has shitty quality screenshots he took from my render examples posted on his website. "
"Other posters have been saying this may be exaggerated but I want to be sure before I accuse her.

Tape a piece of paper to your mirror. Write down one thing you like about yourself every day, physical or otherwise.

Try drawing a couple self portraits, even if they're cartoons or stick figures.

Give yourself some small fitness goals to knock out, like a long walk or a sports game, to show how strong your body is and what it can do."
"Actually boundaries have been crossed. OP specifically said that his game nights are cutting into date times....essentially he's blowing off his girlfriend for this. He's also gone to Allie about their relationship.

"Jewelers have done a fantastic job of enforcing the stereotype that all women are into jewelry and that jewelry is a symbol of love that should never be judged and should always be cherished. As a woman, I say bah on all of that!

Jewelry is just like any other accessory.  Guys don't go gaga over every tie or pair of cufflinks they receive as a gift, because no one expects them to.  They are seen as mere accessories.  Some are cool.  Some are meh.  And some are ugly.  Big deal.

You don't say whether your wife is into jewelry.  You don't say whether she's into this specific kind of jewelry.  You do, however, say she's not into sentimental things.  So why did you give her a sentimental thing?  Why are you expecting her to be sentimental over this thing when you know that's not her style?

If it's a $100 piece, maybe she feels it is too dressy to wear for everyday use.  Have ya'll had any special occasions since you gave it to her?  Perhaps she does plan on wearing it, but only on romantic occasions like Valentine's Day (honestly, I wouldn't know what to do with a heart-shaped thing outside of V-Day).  So while you have every right to feel confused and hurt, I would maybe try to pump the brakes a little and think about the range of possibilities beyond ""SHE HATES MY GIFT!!""   "

I am trying to give her advice but I don't know what to say. It's hard because I feel so bad for her, but I don't see how she can reasonably avoid apples her entire life. I really think that if her parents try to get apples banned from the dining hall, the teasing is going to get worse.

You're missing the point. This is not a post made by the neighbour complaining that people watch her through the window being naked in her house. 
"Honestly...you sound kind of like an asshole? Like why focus so much on the physical description of your ex and her ""hot thin blonde"" friend? Her hot best friend so happens to have a thing for you now after all this time? Why didn't she just contact you before when you and your ex broke up?

Sorry dude, this whole post rubs me wrong. Sure, you're doing better than your ex but no need for the hoity-toity attitude. Sounds kinda like you're still obsessed with your ex or something. You still ask about her and talk about her despite her being bat-shit crazy? You sure you've moved on mate? 

And go for the date man. She doesn't sound like a good friend to your ex if she went to talk to you instead of following her friend to make sure if she's feeling ok or not. Better for your ex to find out who's really there for her and who's not."
Allie is taking the spot that your girlfriend should be in. What is a partner if not your go to person? The only thing your girlfriend provides that Allie doesn't is sex. You have emotional intimacy set with Allie and admit you do not have that with your girlfriend. I wouldn't stay with someone if I wasn't their #1 (short of kids obviously). If Allie can't even make an effort to meet your girlfriend then she probably knows it's inappropriate.

"I feel more sorry for Becca - she thinks she's going on a date with a guy who she thinks is really keen on her, she's actually seeing someone who's using her as a test to see if her prefers someone else and doesn't have the balls to be honest with her that he's not really interested."

"It's actually not uncommon for betrayed spouses to have PTSD-like flashbacks for *years* afterwards. What you husband did to you wasn't a little accident, like forgetting to take the trash out. It was a huge, intentional, betrayal that he *chose* to do. It takes years of transparency and atonement on the cheater's part to earn that trust back. 

What is your husband doing to make things better? Because it sounds like, right now, you're doing all the emotional work to make this okay, while he sits back confused what the fuss is all about.

I can understand the urge to minimize his actions. It's frightening to be truly angry at someone we love, and admit that they've done something really reprehensible, because doing so might mean we'd have to really feel the pain we're repressing, and might possibly end the relationship.

But the more pressure your put in yourself to just move on, the unhappier you're going to be for longer. I would suggest you find a counselor who can help you define for yourself what you need to move on - and whether you even want to.

Be gentle on yourself. Cry when you need to. Don't blame yourself for your very natural feelings, and good luck."
