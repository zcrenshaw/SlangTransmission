That's funny ^^/s
"I have literally never felt a poop in there like that. I'm surprised others have. I can see how you might be able to push one, I don't know why you'd want to try. But yeah, no, didn't think you could feel one. Ewie."
Thats not really what a pun is.

You just ruined women for everybody. Thanks.
"Yes, thanks for the downvote, as someone that has been on Reddit for 10 years you'd think that you would be aware that it is not a ""disagree"" button.

Anyway, dicks are entirely external and as other people have pointed out they are much easier to clean, and also a lot easier to inspect for irregularities. Vaginas are mainly internal, moist, and sometimes, smelly/fish tasting. I have seen vaginas that smell so bad that my fingers smelled hours after she left my place even after washing them. Dicks do not have this problem.

&gt; I just find it rich that you see WAY more men complaining about it when we quietly complain amongst ourselves to spare your feelings and pretend it's totally a joy to do. It isn't.

Again, I said I don't like it but do it anyway so you're really arguing with the wrong person on this subject. Also, some girls really enjoy sucking dick. I have found plenty that love it, so your argument is invalid because it doesn't apply to the general population, more so it applies to you and your friends, and that is fine, you don't have to enjoy sucking dick, you don't even technically have to suck any dick ever. It's your decision, if you don't want to do it, don't."

"Don't attribute malice to something easier explained by ignorance. What me and Lemminger are arguing is that its pretty easy to moralize situations within a public internet forum. It completely matters where you were raised. Some countries eat dogs and lock them up in cages their whole lives in order to be eaten like we do to chickens. US and western europeans are revolted by this thread only because we put dogs lives as sacred. Those kids cruelly snuffed a life but even if you look on with disdain as your neighborhood kids light up ants with a magnifying glass, deep down you care less than if they were lighting a dog on fire and it's 100% OKAY to admit that because you have a certain view of cruelty as do others."

"And not everything has to revolve around women, or black people, or Native Americans either. I’m saying it’s bullshit that people can be sexist to men and racist to white people and nobody cares because “muh privilege”

All these people talk about privilege from their iPhone X or as a SENATOR or some HARVARD student. Hypocritical double standard bullshit, and I’m sick of it. "

"Jesus, you let one dumb bitch fuck up your entire life like that? You should stop being pathetic and not let assholes control you like that. You gave up control of your own thoughts and emotions to someone else just because they were an asshole. You're going to meet lots of asshole throughout your life, man. You either learn to not let them rule your emotions and take charge of your own mind or your entire life will be just as sad and pathetic as it has been so far. I hope you learn how to not be a little bitch before it's too late."

"Go join some fora. Variations on this theory has been going around for decades.

Maybe someone didn't pick your exact combinations of fictions to ram into the 40k 'verse but you can be sure they've all passed and nobody gave a shit because of how obvious it is.

Hell, try making a list of warhammer characters whose names are direct anagrams of movie characters like Marbo/Rambo or just straight up puns and references.

Fan theories about how movies connect to 40k are not clever. That's how GW sells stuff to thirteen year olds."
" They shot him down

They shot him down

They thought he was a monster

But he was the king

&amp; nbsp; 

They came to his island

And they brought her with them

They wanted to get his picture

But they were surprised by his enormous size

&amp; nbsp;

And when he saw the woman

He took her without question

Because after all

He was the king

&amp; nbsp;

And he loved the woman

He loved the way she looked

But she wouldn’t stop

Her screaming

&amp; nbsp;

But he loved the woman

And he fought a Tyrannosaurus Rex

It was a bloody battle

But he fought it for his woman

&amp; nbsp;

And he climbed up a mountain

And he looked around

Some kind of forest

With all those dinosaurs

&amp; nbsp;

And he stripped his woman

He stripped her bare

But there was a pterodactyl
There!

&amp; nbsp;

And then a hero

Came and took his woman

And they fell off the mountain

Into some water

&amp; nbsp;

And then later

He came looking for his woman

But they were waiting

And they threw a bomb

&amp; nbsp;

And they tied him

And they took him across the ocean

And they chained him

And put him in the show

&amp; nbsp;

But when he saw his woman

He broke loose

And everyone fled in terror

And he was looking for her

&amp; nbsp; 

And he overturned the train

He was looking in the street

And then he found her in her apartment

&amp; nbsp;

And He climbed up the Empire State building

It was like a phallic Symbol

And he took his woman

To the top of that towering temple

&amp; nbsp;

And he climbed up and looked around

Some kind of city

With all those skyscrapers

And all the cars

&amp; nbsp;

Just him and his screaming woman

They were finally alone

He loved his woman

You could see it in his eyes

His great big eyes

&amp; nbsp; 

He loved his woman

From the moment he saw her

He was all choked up inside

&amp; nbsp;

But when the airplanes came

He was soon to die

But he hung on long enough to set his woman down

And make sure

She was safe

&amp; nbsp;

And as the bullets pierced

He looked at her so sincere

Before he fell

Because he loved his woman

&amp; nbsp;

They shot him down

They shot him down

They thought he was a monster

But he was the king

&amp; nbsp;

Who killed the monkey

Who killed the monkey

‘Twas beauty

That killed the beast

 

And Willis O’Brien died

A tragic death

There wasn’t much

That he had left

 

And Ray Harryhousen said

That when Willis died

That’s when the king

Was really dead

 

They shot him down

They shot him down

They thought he was a monster

But he was the king

 

But he was the king

But he was the king

But he was the king"

"I think you didn't read the question.  It was ""totally losing touch with the times.""  They have totally lost touch with the times.  The only way they're winning things is by (a) cheating/gerrymandering, (b) appealing to the most base of horrible people (bigots/racists/sexists) or (c) using sky warlock Jesus.

"&gt; Teacher here: fortunately or unfortunately most interviews happen at the main office...you get a pretty good look at the ""worst"" kids if you spend some time there (show up early so you HAVE to wait) If it's quiet then youre dealing with a pretty decent school...if its a train-wreck throw the interview!!!

Seriously..  What the actual fuck!?

As a teacher:  your job is to help (kids|students).  The ""worst"" kids at _any_ school are still fucking human beings;  that _clearly_ need help!

If you are selfishly turning down jobs because you ""don't like the attitude of the kids"" you should probably get out of the profession. People need to stop focusing on the ""kids they like""  and start focusing on the kids that need help. 

And people wonder why 'trouble' kids continue causing trouble..

o.O"

"It's all in the terms and conditions. [https://tosdr.org/#facebook](Here)'s a simplified version. Also, it's a cross-platform thing. I remember I was listening to some rock band on YT then suddenly ads for one of their concerts appear on my facebook feed. "
"If you had a kid that wen full autistic, you would probably be grasping at straws for a reason also.  Doesn't make it right, but it's fairly understandable. "
"&gt; It's pretty dishonest not telling him something like that, especially with the feelings it gave you.

Ehhh.. there's no reason to tell him. It'll make him feel shitty/nervous/sad and make her feel better. It basically takes the pain / guilt from someone who was a party to the incident and shifts it onto an innocent bystander.

&gt; The best relationships are built on trust, not secrets.

I agree with you about trust and honesty. But the best relationships also leave a lot of room for individual privacy, especially regarding things that have no direct bearing on the relationship.  

If she's unhappy with her boyfriend, she can break up with him. But telling him about that incident serves no decent purpose."

"As an MD that finds Nurse Jackie whiny and annoying, let me chip in that in 12 years of hospital work, I've never called in sick, because one of my mentors comically advised me that you only get sick days when you're on ECMO (basically cardiac bypass).

"I suggest you contact your states welfare/medicare/medicaid fraud office and your states health and welfare services office.  When funds like this are siphoned off it can add an unnecessary burden and detriment on society.
