"Am I missing where in the post she said Marie was gay? Her having a girlfriend just means that she likes women, not that she doesn’t like men. "
"I have a Miata. I call it ""Miata Mood"" - no matter what kind of bad mood I'm in, 10 minutes on a nice day with the top down is all I need to get into a good mood. And I'm not even a car person! You made a good choice."
"I would hate to think of my brother not telling me something like this, just out of fear of straining his relationship with my SO.

edit: but i agree it's a risk :("
"&gt; It's amazing to me how naive a lot of the people are who post here.

Not everyone who travels frequently is the type of person to cheat on their significant other.  Traveling doesn't affect your morals at all, if you're unwilling to cheat when you're at home then you won't do it when you're abroad. I have travelled plenty without my spouse however I would *never* betray their trust. Not everyone who travels does so looking to hook up, intentional or otherwise.

So long as OP trusts his girlfriend then he has nothing to worry about."

"She is originally from another country and he is a friend from there. She attends college in my country where she's been living for the last year. She is home for the summer and while I have met many of her friends from her home, I haven't met this guy. "
"You’re not giving yourself enough credit here. You offered to share in something that is important to him. That is incredibly thoughtful of you. And he said he would **love** that. Not, “oh, um, I... guess.” LOVE. 

His behavior was deplorable, as well as a huge red flag. Abusive behavior like that tends to only escalate in relationships. You’re only 8 months in.  You can do better. You *deserve* better. "
"Okay, first things first: trying to impress someone is usually pretty obvious—and ironically is therefore one of the least impressive things you can do. You want to make a good impression, but you don’t want to come across as a show-off. This is especially important when you’re a lot younger, because it’s easy to come off like you’re trying too hard.

Honestly, you know what’s likeliest to win over the brother &amp; his wife? Give *them* a chance to impress *you.* What is something they’re especially good at or knowledgeable about? Preferably this is something you’re also interested in. Plan an activity around that, and be willing to watch/listen/learn. They’ll feel like genius sophisticates, and you’ll all have a good time. Like, if they enjoy alcohol, maybe ask the brother and/or his wife what they think is the best craft brewery/cocktail joint in the area. (If they’re not familiar with the area, ask how to pick a great one.) Go there. Maybe take a cue on what to order. If you guys enjoy yourselves, boom, the brother &amp; wife come across like awesome savvy people, and some of that shine rubs off on you. 

(Also, if the brother is helping pick the place, it’s less like you’re issuing an invitation where you would be expected to treat.) 

It’s been said a lot, but bears repeating: People forget what you said, but they always remember how you made them feel. So figure out an activity that will make them feel great about themselves, and they’ll probably wind up feeling great about you."
"Totally normal that they do this. Also totally normal that you don't share their humor in this.  (On the positive side...it does sound like you have a quick-witted bunch that enjoy each others' company!)

But you getting freaked out about it... not so normal. (Sorry.)  Plus, any negative reaction will inevitably encourage them. (Again, sorry.)

If you can get your husband on board with limiting the potty humor to when at home only, and specifically off limits at mealtimes, I think that is a very reasonable family rule to set.  That would be my hill to die on in your position.

Other than that, just let it go. Just quietly walk away from it when you can and occupy yourself with something else for a few minutes until things settle down.

Having four kids, I can tell you that they'll probably outgrow this kind of humor (at least in mixed company).

As to whether your husband will ever let it go....well, mine is 55 and he hasn't yet.  
It (nearly) never gets a chuckle out of me but I try not to react negatively.  (Sometimes I put my fingers in my ears.)

Which can be hard because we have a business that we run so we are pretty much together 24/7. Then again, if the potty humor were to just stop forever one day I'd be very sad. 

Because I love him to pieces. ALL of him. (Together 22+ years.)"
"I do have various friends, males and females. 

But see, your crossing a very fine line. Call it an emotional affair if you’d like since you’re being honest here and you’re telling me your relationship with this female has been flirtatious as well. You don’t necessarily need to kiss her but you don’t think about her like a regular normal friend/sister.

You might lose an opportunity to meet a good girl. No good girl who knows she’s worthy will put up with this. And the ones that are okay with you having a flirtatious friendship with your friend is because they might do that to you anyways. 

And you’re giving you friend way too much power by putting her first making her the more important person over your possible SOs. It’s disrespectful and no one likes to be sencond place in their SOs life. 

Put yourself in her shoes. What if it was the other way around?

"&gt; full figure out what I needed and wanted 

Can easily be translated to ""I don't know if I want you"" which can easily be translated to ""I don't want you"" cause if you wanted her, there would be nothing to think about. She gave you time to think and she took time of her own too. Or do you only get to think about things because you instigated? "
"Agreed. Just because its something you wouldnt want for yourself, doesnt mean she doesnt want it for herself. But she deserves transparency if you think theres a chance she'd not like it."
"He frequently calls me crazy when I react (or overly sensitive).

but long-term you're not stuck getting attached to a guy who could reject your daughter. you're dating for 2, now :p

YES it is harder dating as a single mother but....thems the breaks.

not alot you can do about it.

you're no longer dating just for yourself, you have your daughter to consider. A guy who isnt okay with her shouldn't be okay with you."
"Wow... your partner sounds like a jerk. I get being angry and hurt if a partner snapped at me in that way. That hurts. But the way he is treating you is really troubling. It's very punishing over a quick emotional misstep. It sounds like your relationship has built up a bunch of resentment. 

Personally? I only date adults who can handle their feelings without being punishing, dramatic or purposefully hurtful. It sounds like he is doing all three along with a childish silent treatment. I would NOT be interested in going through the trials and tribulations of life with someone who handles conflict and hurt in this crappy way. "

"""When I do everything around the house and you dont even put away your dirty dishes I am not in a fun mood.  When you call me a nag bc I have to repeatedly ask you to get shit done Im not in a sexy mood.  If you want me to feel fun and sexy around you examine what you bring to the relationship

Let me know when we can talk about our issues in a productive way.'

"Just because you forgave him doesn't mean you owe it to him to stay in this relationship.

Unfortunately, you're still gonna have to deal with this jackass as you figure out cat custody and living situations. Look into breaking the lease.

"Somehow he can't see your perspective at all yet he so readily and easily sees and understands his mother's.

"What. The. Fuck. 

This is fucking absurd. No wonder you’re feeling a bit crazy; you shouldn’t even be having this conversation! 

Sharing something personal with anyone, particularly a SO, presumes privacy. 

So if he gets ED, shits himself, prematurely ejaculates, comes in his eye one time...I could keep going here, you get to just go ahead and share that with anyone you choose, right? 

I don’t think you can overreact to this, personally. There’s such a clear dissonance between what you (and most of the world I assure you) thinks is acceptable behaviour and what he and his family think that I don’t even know how you would begin to breach this gap. 

This would be divorce territory for me OP. "
"It struck me as weird how he was a devout Catholic and his family wouldn't like him dating a woman going through a divorce... but good Mr. Catholic was okay with outright lying to family and friends. I love when people pick and chose which sins matter and which don't.

Don't waste anymore time on him, OP. You deserve more than he will ever give."
For real. This guy is a dickbag.
"You should tell him that he can find his passion in his copious free time.  After work hours, on the weekend.  If he's unhappy with his work, he needs to find another job.  But he shouldn't quit without having another one lined up."
"Agreed. And I can’t believe people are  telling OP “it’s just a tail.” It’s not just a tail. Hell, it’s not even about the tail.

 It’s not about how other people feel about your decisions. It’s not about whether people personally agree with tail docking. It’s about your agency to do what you want with your property. And your trust that someone who you’ve entrusted to temporarily watch something you own does not permanently alter it.

If I lend you a sweatshirt, I don’t want you to dye it a different color. Even if it’s your favorite color. Even if it’s MY favorite color. You don’t dye it without my permission because it’s not yours. 

You don’t just do things to other people’s stuff. Regardless of your feelings about tail docking, everyone should be able to agree about that.

And that’s not even going into the issue with it being a living thing that OP has a relationship with and cares for. 

And OP’s sister is a grown woman, not a selfish dumb kid. The fact that she thinks doing something like this is acceptable is so crazy to me. This is behavior on par with someone who either is very young, very immature or who has some kind of personality disorder that makes them unable to empathize."

"Life isn't a disney movie, ""soul mates"" aren't a thing, and this would still be bordering on the edge of immaturity if you subtracted 10 years off your age. 

The fact you're *this* upset is bad enough, but this reaction:

&gt; I wish to withdraw myself emotionally from the relationship so that I am not hurt anymore.

Only reinforces that you lack the maturity to successfully conduct an adult relationship. The correct response to having your ego stung isn't ""withdraw emotionally"", this is a childish and ineffective means of resolving minor, **minor** issues like this one. 

By all means, feel free to continue freaking out and **making** this into a problem, though."
You deserve to have the hots for your bf and he deserves a gf who thinks he's sexy.  I don't think this will work.

"&gt;People are telling me it’s just a tail. But my sister went against a deep principle I have (being kind to animals) and did this.

Fuck all of the people for saying this. I am so goddamned tired of hearing the excuse ""You don't lose family over ______."" Sometimes you do. 

This is so obviously a bad thing. I'm not sure I could ever forgive it. I would be pretty easy not to talk to her again. "
"I know what you mean, but to receive “damages” of any kind, you have to prove “damage” - something you lost that was worth something, that happened because a law was violated. 

You also have to win a lawsuit to receive any damages, and what could she sue her sister for? The sister did something morally wrong, but she didn’t break an existing law that I can think of. Courts aren’t there to uphold morality, they uphold the law."
"It’s not clear from your post whether you communicated about his drinking problem prior to the incident. Like did he realize how much his drinking bothered you? It kind of seems like you didn’t even realize the extent of it until the incident, so I’m curious how this looks from his perspective. If it’s the case that he wasn’t aware it was this big of a deal until the incident then I think you’re being too harsh. But if it’s the type of thing you’ve brought up before and he’s promised to stop, I get it."
"If OP's husband had helped her through her degree instead of making sure he had everything he wanted and making her keep paying exactly half of all bills, I wouldn't see a problem with her supporting him while he follows his dream.

"So - this wasn’t a giant huge secret that you wanted to take to your grave. It was him mentioning you had a day off. And while I absolutely understand why you wanted to keep it private, I also understand why he was kind of worried about you and let it slip. They may have said “she needs time off” and he said “yes I know she does, she is actually off tomorrow.”. It’s a pain and he should keep your secrets, but he was worried about you, and this leads me to my next point. 

It’s concerning that you feel that you would rather hide from everyone the fact that you need a few days off rather than just say “no” to your sister’s demand for plans. Like.... “no.”  Just “no.” Why don’t you feel able to say no, and is that part of why you feel overwhelmed?"

"He held office hours. He advertised those office hours. Students showed up to those office hours. He deliberately blew them off.

If she comes back, I'd insist on never being left alone with her again. Let him deal with the emotional labor 100%.  I'm wondering how much of that has been foisted on you since April.  It's grossly unfair to deal with mental illness when you're not qualified, while someone else (your husband) is actively sabotaging the treatment.  How long is Emily supposed to live with you?  I wouldn't put up with any open-ended deal."

"it's not *my* alternative explanation. It's a VERY reasonable point about what a statistic can actually tell us.
That statistic *does not* tell us that living together before marriage *causes* a higher incidence of divorce. It tells us only that between people who have lived together before marriage, and people who haven't, those who haven't tend not to divorce at the same rate.

It is bad statistical inference to say that *therefore living together before marriage leads to higher divorce rate*. BECAUSE you cannot isolate that feature for causal analysis. And it is in fact, a very worthwhile point to note that the population of people who do not live together before marriage may be influenced by religious belief, or whatever else, that might be the actual causal factor for lower divorce rates. 

It's not about ideology, its about interpreting a piece of information correctly.

edit: to put it more clearly, the statistic is *not* a ""fact to the contrary"", it is, at best, a compelling piece of evidence to investigate further, and to find out *why*. The statistic itself does not tell us *Why* (it does not tell us that living together beforehand IS WHY those people divorced)"
"I know a couple who had exactly the same dynamic with board games. She then initiated the break-up in quite possibly one of the most vindictive ways I've ever seen (I was there, and yes it was incredibly uncomfortable). I obviously can't say for certain whether the two are directly related, but I don't think it's a stretch that someone with poor emotional control is tough to be with in a relationship.

Speaking as someone who loves board games though, I'll say that I really dislike playing with couples who do that. If it's someone helping a kid, fine. But she's an adult, and it ruins the fun of the game if one player constantly whines for freebies. Especially in games with fluid team setups. You might find that nobody wants to play with you anymore, which I guess solves the problem in a different way."
"They both are being ridiculous. My boyfriend is a chemical engineer and if we watched a documentary about some chemical reaction I could make an observation like, ‘It looks like they’re using x to do x.’ If my boyfriend responded, ‘Nah it’s way more likely they’re using x to do x because of reasons,’ I’d either trust that or be like, ‘Oh cool let’s look it up and see what they’re doing.’ Because yes, my boyfriend knows more about that than I do - it doesn’t bruise my ego to admit that and trust his specialism. I wouldn’t double down on what I originally said even though I don’t know what I’m talking about in comparison to my boyfriend’s experience, and if I did really think I was right I’d look it up with him. My boyfriend also wouldn’t be such a stubborn arse that he’d tell me he knew way more than me so shut up questioning things. They both sound like insufferable know it alls, why do these arguments even occur when you can look absolutely anything up on Google and learn together?"

You were legitimately angry at your friend for the terrible way she treated you.

Either way, start setting boundaries and keeping an eye on how she's making you feel.

"How are you losing faith in finding a good guy when you havent even been single at all? Everything wasnt great and this going sour wasnt sudden. Within less than a year you went from deciding to end one marriage, to falling in love before your divorce and already thinking about starting a family with someone else. No offence but this is how women end up with 4 kids from 5 different guys. 


Hopefully you’ve learned:


- that it is better to take it slow. Properly close off one relationship- be single for some time- start off slowly with someone else - after the butterfly-months decide whether you want to commit

- that it takes time to really get to know the other person. The chase-phase and honeymoon phase can feel  magical, dont lose your head


- that you tend to look the other way and wave away any reasonable doubts. You actually glorify a situation when it’s not all good. The first signs already started ‘a few months in’. 

- that you have trouble respecting yourself and your boundaries. You went in hiding and sneaking around for him, even though you already felt you were not okay with this. On top of that, you kept ‘showering him with words of love and praise’ on a daily basis. And STILL you idealize him here and what you thought you had with him. Can you see the madness right now? Investigate what in you causes you to minimize your own worth and to not at all respect your boundaries.



Dating whilst having a kid is a whole other ball game. This read like a teenage drama, you dont want that. 
Give your self time to reflect (with a therapist, read some books etc) and build up healthy behaviour in order to become a healthy example. Maybe make a rational decision that no matter what, for a full year you will stay single. This year will be for you completely, your own growth and extra support for your kid in dealing with the divorce. Even if a bloody prince comes along. Before July 7th 2019 no relationships, except with yourself. It might be difficult and you’ll want to numb/patch (old) feelings of hurt, loneliness and unworthiness with external love, a knight in shining armour or lovey dovey messaging on dating apps. But dont give in and work through those feelings, knowing that you will get out stronger on the other side. 


Good luck you and your kiddo!!"
"I found out in 8th grade, never questioned my parents and never heard otherwise (no clue how I avoided that - went to public school). I didn’t continue to believe in him though. Just a reaction that was a mix of “am I retarded?” and my parents did a good job of making Christmas awesome. "
No. Because she bought him a gift.
"I feel love from your post for the daughter you have lost for now. It is interesting to me that even though she speaks on you as the issue she still has not chosen to reach out to him.

"Absolutely none of this is your problem. Your parents shouldn't be involving you in this situation or discussing it with you. They should vent about it to friends, siblings, a therapist
 They should seek advice from a lawyer or financial adviser. NOT their son. 

Take a step back from this and focus on your own life. Let them work this out. You're a devoted son to be concerned, but it's really not your business. "
"I think people are interpreting this as being ""all about the money"" because your post is... all about money? You talk about being  concerned about the ""principle"" but I'm not really clear on what principle that would be, beyond ""I want my inheritance protected."" None of this is wrong, per se, and you clearly have some very real and justifiable anger towards your father about what happened between him and your mom. With that said, if you  came into the inheritance convo with your dad with the same tone and focus on money that came across in this post, I can also understand why he didn't take that well, particularly if, as it seems from your post, he's not emotionally mature or eager to accept responsibility for his actions and why they might leave you feeling upset and distant. 

If it's important to resolve this while maintaining a relationship with your dad, maybe consider having another, *carefully planned,* conversation with him about this. If your brother shares your concerns, maybe you can approach this together (your call as to whether this would help or hurt your case if your dad tends to feel ganged up on). I would focus on wanting to move forward on better terms after the divorce, and to have a respectful relationship with his new SO if that's what he wants (and if you think It's something you can reasonably try to do). Apologize for approaching previous discussions in a way that made him think you only wanted money, but at the same time, mention that you do have financial concerns and that they are preventing you from moving forward in a healthy way. Ask him  to visit a lawyer with you and explore whether there are steps he can take to reserve at least some portion of his inheritance for you (whether through a will or some other mechanism, if he feels that focusing on the will is too morbid). Make it clear that you don't want more than your fair share, but you would like some assurances that things will be fair and that you are protected.  Maybe frame it as part of his ""legacy"" to ensure that his children benefit in the same way from inherited wealth as he did when he inherited from his father.

Beyond that I think you have to accept that you ultimately can't *make* him do anything he doesn't want to do, and work on letting go of your resentment and anger about things you can't change. This includes both the inheritance and the circumstances of your parents' divorce. Again, I think the hurt and betrayal you feel is understandable, but it also seems like a weight around your neck, and it doesn't really help to carry that around. It seems unlikely that your dad will suddenly snap into self awareness and give your feelings satisfaction, so you need to figure out how to square those feelings yourself and not rely on him for resolution. Think about the kind of relationship you'd want to have with your dad independent of the inheritance, and work towards that if you can."

"If your girlfriend made a giant, 10 ft tall neon sign that said ""my son comes first, and he and his girlfriend will be living here"", would that change your mind? Because she's basically done everything but that to make it crystal clear to you, through actions, not words, that this is the case.

If her son gets arrested, guess what? He's not out of your life. The girlfriend and her two babies will still be living there, sucking up your resources, and you and your girlfriend will be raising newborns. Do you really think that your girlfriend is going to kick her newborn grandchildren out in the street? And if she did, what does that say about her?

I think you keep assuming that her son will be out of the picture any moment now, but there are children involved now. He's not going anywhere. He doesn't have a job, he doesn't have skills, her house is the only home he's known, and he has a criminal record.

I'm sure you absolutely love your girlfriend, and this is heartbreaking for you. It sucks. When two people who love each other find that there is a fundamental incompatibility that means they can't be together, it's tragic for everyone involved. If you truly love her, and can't envision a life without her, that's okay too. Just know that her son, and her new grandchildren, are not going anywhere. I don't know how much clearer  she can make it to you. I know that you don't want to believe it, I know that you keep thinking that there's a magic combination of words you can say that will convince her she's wrong, and like a lot of other people in this subreddit, maybe you'll hang on for 10 years believing that any day now, she's going to wake up and magically change. It never happens, but I guess we all have to have hope.

Good luck.

"You view her like a trophy. She feels she deserves a trophy for the work that she put in to make you worthy of her. Neither of you love the other. Why are you together?

"It sounds like this is a combo of ""shoving responsibility away"" like a panic reaction. ""Well if it's not mine, I don't have to worry! Any chance it's not mine?"" and a deep, weird fear coming to the surface at the worst possible moment. 

You fix this by: 

Going to therapy and getting some help with ""not trusting people"" which ugh I am so fucking tired of hearing/reading that from men. Women aren't all one giant Siamese twin sharing a mesh network like hosts from Westrworld. Just because one woman cheated on you or hurt you doesn't mean *all the rest will*. Or even if every single woman you dated hurt you badly, that has *no bearing* on your current girl. Why is she paying someone else's income tax? Not cool. 

Not just apologizing but doing it right. A real apology has the following elements: 

Sincere regret expressed explicitly 

Acknowledgement of the specific harm and incident (Not ""mistakes were made"" and not ""sorry I whatevered your whatevers"") 

Acknowledgement of responsibility and ZERO discussion of whose fault it is that you did this or said this other than your own 

A plan to change, and actual change. 

Maybe a text ""I'm so sorry, I have a therapy appointment on Tuesday to start working through my trust issues. I realize I hurt you badly and I was a real jerk for implying that you had reason to doubt the paternity of our child. I love you and I hope you can see your way towards taking me back.""

"That's crazy to me. I've attended quite a few weddings here in Canada, in addition to a few as a groomsmen, and I have NEVER had to pay for a single thing. The couple paid for our suits, either as a purchase or a rental from a shop, and same thing on the girls side. In addition they would provide gifts for the groomsmen and bridesmaids. I got a custom watch for one wedding, a special pen for another, and a tailored shirt for another. 

The only thing that we paid for was our own portion of the bill plus we split the cost of the groom's bill on the bachelor party, and the girls said did the same for the bachelorette party. "

"To emphasize on this point /u/staralfur92\- cooking a fresh meal every night...I don't even want to cook for myself every night! Barely anybody has the energy and willpower to cook a meal from scratch every night, let alone someone trying to keep up with 3 kids + an unhelpful husband (how much do you clean up after the messes he makes?). This is not about you being able to cook a fresh meal every night, this is him making unrealistic expectations for you to shatter your confidence and strip you of your self worth (""nothing will ever be good enough"" mentality). I bet you even if you did manage to cook a new meal every night, it would be ""oh it's too bland"" ""I don't like chicken like this"" ""there's not enough variety"" etc. He's already shown you a glimpse of this with the housecleaning- a spotless house isn't enough- are you kidding me? Most people would be thrilled and say it was above and beyond to have a spotless house with three young children!

An abuser's goal, whether conscious or unconscious, is to undermine their victim, to make them more pliable and easier to manipulate. If you aren't sure what he wants, you're going to be bending over backwards for him to make him happy, even if he only shows it 1&amp;#37; of the time. He's surrepticiously lowering your expectations, so he will be able to walk all over you in a few years. Just because you don't think he's doing it intentionally, that doesn't negate the lasting effect it will ultimately have on you, your self-esteem, and your relationship."

"Okay at first I was going to sort of backhand you for being snobby and just assuming she'd had a college degree and not having one being a dealbreaker but it does seem like she has gone out of her way to actively deceive you on the fact that she didn't have one.  

Regardless of what, you can break up with anyone for any reason you want.  You don't need a justification to do it, but deceiving you for so long is definitely not a minor reason.  "
"&gt; In our argument last night he did say ""You can't seem to go 24 hours without needing sex""

Get the fuck out of this relationship, now.

A partner should never shame their partner for wanting closeness, intimacy, and physical loving. That's a huge red flag."
"This was too painful to read so I just scanned it. Sounds like the gist is that you've learned a woman you banged a few months ago is a few months pregnant, and you believe she was not with anyone else during that time. 

If this is the meat of it, then yes I do think you should pursue a paternity test. Keep in mind it's quite possible she was having sex with her ex (and / or others) in the period of time she evidently conceived this child, so it's not absolutely yours. It is accurate that the pregnancy typically needs to be 12+ weeks along before sex can be determined. "
"&gt;People who are insecure with their partner talking about them behind their back should have an agreement that they won’t do that to each other.

Unsurprisingly, you try to paint people who are uncomfortable with complaining about their partners (behind their backs, without their consent) - and who therefore expect the same courtesy in return - as _insecure_.  Unsurprising, but disappointing.

"Exactly, this is how I'd proceed. If a bridesmaid told me she had a budget I'd either specifically stick to that for all bridesmaids or pay for the overage myself.

"&gt;  a very puritanical view.

This kind of irritates me, to be honest. I think the husband is more in the wrong here and I do think it's absolute bullshit that the mistress is getting more crap from people. However, the friend did actively engage in something she knew could potentially absolutely devastate another human being. It's not ""very puritanical"" to think that someone is horrible for showing so little care for another person's happiness and mental well-being :/"
"I think Op is in a fog of his own. I doubt he’d be honest about his true feelings over a situation like this. His response would likely be, “I trust my wife and I’d trust that her guy friend made a mistake and learned from it”.

"Bro. You’re defending and comforting a woman who is proven to have no qualms about going after married men. 


You should, as a married person, be offended at the very idea of an affair. You should *not*, as a married person, *become someone’s damn affair confidant*.

I would insist on that friendship ending too, and the fact that you aren’t is kind of twisted. "

"Not a lawyer, but I would guess admitting you were the main caregiver and (main breadwinner too?) for the six years you've been together would be a bad move when discussion of alimony happens in court.  Maybe just limit it to the years you were married.  Let the judge think/know she was able to successfully take care of herself and kids before marrying you a year ago.

Good luck man. "
"Regarding being the main breadwinner that's to a certain degree true. She works as do I yet I bring in the larger income and pay a higher percentage of bills to boot, however, she has more money in the bank than me as she was in receipt of rent from her brother living with us of which I saw not a penny."
"If your having sex you have time to. If a guy dosen't want to hear what you like why bother. Perfect would both parties would ask, but that also dosen't mean you should wait. Seriously if someone has thier head between your legs and it's doing nothing for you, perfect time to speak up. "
"Ok, then why are you even asking?  If the answer is ""bringing a spouse does not happen at my work for anyone, sorry"" then that's the end of the conversation, right?  If he doesn't ""understand"" then that's his problem.  "

Maybe there is a way for you to do this and for her to still join you on some legs of the journey. Are you open to compromise here?
"Political differences is a veil for something else.  If he's just not in love anymore and can't say it to your face (or can't even admit it to himself), or if he's not ready for marriage and it's going too fast, or if he's getting outside pressure from family or there's someone else and he can't just break up.  He can't be honest with you.  If he can't communicate with you and be honest with you and open up with his feelings, he is not ready for marriage.

If he really just isn't happy, he needed to come forward, say to your face and end it like an adult.  Some people can't do that without placing the blame on someone or something else or hiding the real reason behind something trivial or just skipping out and leaving altogether.  It's shitty and not right, but some people just can't handle it.

I'm so sorry this happened to you.  You deserve a real tactful adult response, just don't know if you'll ever get it.  You also deserve to be with someone who treats you better than this."
"I personally don't think he cheated, because there is zero evidence of it. You even went through his texts and nothing much was really talked about. I do think what happened was that him and his ex realized that maybe they could work on things, plus your insecurities probably pushed him away, so he decided breaking up was best in this situation. A lot of people decide to get back together after divorcing, that's why some states make you separate for a whole year before you can go ahead with the divorce. You got with him either a little bit before the divorce was finalized or right after, so I can see him still being in this unsure state. Sure, he shouldn't have gotten with you so soon, but maybe he thought moving on would help him get over his ex.

It sounds like being with a man that has an ex and a child isn't the kind of relationship for you. It shows with how you didn't like them co-parenting and you wanting his daughter to look up to you as a mother figure when she already has a perfectly capable mother. Hell, your ex had to tell his daughter to not talk about her mother around you, that's not right. My stepson talks about his mom a lot, but I sit there and talk along with him.

Lastly, just because you have a key, doesn't mean you should just let yourself into your exes home without warning. You will forever be seen as the crazy ex that yelled at his ex-wife in front of his child. Oh well, move on and find someone that isn't fresh out of a divorce."
"We had spoken about it since being married, and I had said I wouldn't want to abort any potential babies we  made. He said he understood, still wasn't opposed to abortion, but we spoke about how if it happened, we could make it work. 

There was never an agreement to abort. Ever. It was a hypothetical while we were dating (and I would have aborted, we were long distance at the beginning and raising a child would have been impossible). and since we've been married, it was always open to discussion, with him leaning towards and abortion and me away from it, but there was never anything agreed upon. "
"What’s your plan to convince him that you’re worthy of intimacy? That’s not exactly something you can argue people into. It sounds like you have your answer - he’s bored with you and is content to get his sexual desires fulfilled elsewhere. 

If he were interested in fixing this, he’s had plenty of opportunities to tell you. It doesn’t sound like he is. "

"I dunno, it's weird that someone would reach out to me, invite me over, tell me to pick them up tomorrow, then not respond. "
"&gt;honestly if your breakup was so toxic why was she invited to your party in the first place??

This is the part that doesn't compute for me about OP. She is trying to rationalize to us, which means she knows that she is in the wrong. It wasn't toxic enough to continue being friends, but she thinks that if she paints it as toxic, then it will somehow justify stealing ex's collectible as some kind of penance for having the audacity to break up with someone. The ex was completely within her rights to break up with someone with whom it wasn't working out.

And the drama isn't over the ceramic horse, it's about OP's actions surrounding it. OP originally responded unreasonably by stealing. That she used the excuse ""I was ONLY 24 years old"" as if that's some kind of justification is preposterous. Even at half that age, I would have expected someone to know how wrong this behavior was.

And the REALLY damning thing is that OP didn't throw the horse in the trash. She didn't therapeutically break the horse to feel better. She lovingly stored it in the back of her closet, to keep and cherish forever as a memento of her lost love. And then to top it off, when the current fiance found it, OP didn't mention, ""Oh, that's an ex-girlfriend's that I keep to remember her by, and btw she's also still in our lives."" When your fiance finds an old keepsake that you are cherishing to remember an ex, and wants to prominently display it, you need to fess up about what that is. You don't let them use it as the room's centerpiece like some kind of suckered goon. ""And this is my fiancee's ex's most loved ceramic horse, doesn't it just tie the room together?""

OP isn't ready to be married. This was life, waving a beach towel sized red flag in her face to get her head on straight. If you can't be honest with the person who you've committed to marry, then you have no business walking down the aisle. There are also apparently unresolved feelings about the ex."
"Please, explain how it is that OP's relationship with a man who has told her, outright, that she is:

&gt; not good for anything but a hole to fuck 

...and who: 

&gt; calls [her] names and yells at [her]

...is *not* abusive, and is just another victim of this subreddit unfairly judging him.

I'll wait.  Take your time to gather your thoughts."
She's scared and upset about it too. All she wanted was some sign of support and compassion during a time of crisis for them both. His reaction was selfish and cruel.
"Sexuality is more of a spectrum than categories. I would be less concerned with labels like lesbian and be more concerned with ones like girlfriend. How she conceives of her sexual identity is mostly her business, it's obvious by her actions she isn't unattracted to men, or at least attracted to you. 

What you need to talk to her about is how you love her and you guys live together and have an intimate sex life but you're not sure she sees you as in a romantic relationship and whether she loves you as you love her. Your undefined ""we were dating and then she had to move in with me and we bang all the time"" thing is obviously causing you anxiety. "
"Your husband is an ass. Even if you lose the 15 pounds, you are going to get old. No one will be young and fit forever. Physical changes in your partner are a part of marriage. You have a 1 year old, a full time job, and a selfish husband who doesn't pull his weight at home. He has some nerve."
"&gt;  as dumb males we share a lot of what could be considered ""locker room"" talk so I know the type of guy he is

And if you went along with it/participated, you're no better. So maybe your wife and daughter should be grossed out by you, too. It's acceptable for you to do it because you're a good guy, or something? Whatever. And speak for yourself, not every male is ""dumb"" as you so eloquently put it or says gross things about women. Just because you are that way doesn't mean it's normal or acceptable. 

Bottom line, you're being ridiculous. You're more mad at your wife than this creep of a guy preying on a too-young-for-him woman? That's gross. Also, you don't get to decide how mad or offended another person is over this. It's your issue. You want your wife to freak out about it and match your level of anxiety about it? What good would that do? Serious question. Because your daughter is a grown woman and can do as she pleases. You don't have to like it, but freaking out over it is utterly useless since you can do exactly nothing about it. Yet you expect your wife to work herself into a frenzy about it too? Maybe someone needs to stay calm so she can be there for your daughter if/when this ends. Maybe she doesn't want to hurt her relationship with her child over something she can't control.

Get ahold of yourself. Your anger and anxiety are your issues, and nobody is obligated to match your intensity on those fronts. You ""feel angry every time"" you see your wife? That's a ""you"" problem, and you are the one who needs to deal with it because she's not doing anything wrong.

And maybe this can be a lesson about what ""locker room talk"" says about you as a person and the respect you have for other people (namely, women). Because despite what anyone says trying to normalize it, ""locker room talk"" isn't normal and not every guy talks like that.

Your friend is a creep but your daughter is well past childhood and there's nothing you can do about this. And you're going to ruin your relationships with both your wife and your daughter if you don't get ahold of yourself. And it won't be your ex-friend's fault, it will be yours, because your actions are completely on you and nobody else."
"I could t imagine being in a relationship where my partner did not find me sexually attractive. I wouldn’t even know how to cope? That would be a long dark tunnel, trying to keep that relationship alive.  "
"You are doing great and making awesome decisions for yourself and your future. Please don't let your friends tell you any differently. When they bring it up, let them know that you're doing what's best for you and that you want to save so you can be just as comfortable in the future as you are now. But also, maybe consider that these people have very different values than you do. Maybe start making new friends who have similar values to you and won't shame you for not spending. "
"&gt; A - Has been a good friend since before she was my boss, hard to just cut ties with someone I do care about. Feelings or no feelings.

"Has he done anything to make you believe he hasn't been faithful? If not then no wonder hes hurt, you dont trust him for what looks like no reason. "
"&gt; Am I wrong for asking for one? He literally cried and now I feel like a horrible person.

I'd be really offended, and quite suspicious of how you'd managed the full year away after that request.

His reaction suggests he's been faithful, too.

Put yourself in his shoes: he loves you, he's thinking about you while he's in incredibly dangerous situations overseas, he's looking forward so much to seeing you again. He gets home, he hasn't entertained the thought of fucking around, and you refuse to believe that he's been faithful and demand a medical test. Welcome home?

Now is the time to tell him you believe him, and apologise profusely, and reassure him as hard as possible that you did not screw around yourself. And maybe get off r/relationships for a while - this place warps your sense of what's ""normal""."
"I used to do this with my ex but I would go the whole hog, come back wasted and start a fight. If he’s not coming back wasted, then I think you have to let it slide. Everyone needs time when you’ve just had an argument. Let him come back and try resolve the argument you’ve had. "
"Well OP’s wife clearly hasn’t emotionally matured much past 19, so I bet she has a tendency to project that issue onto others."
"Probably could get a big ass clue if he started with examining his parents' relationship. We learn from them, yaknow."
"I feel trapped is exactly how you worded it.

That is not a healthy way to ever feel.

Dump this fool"
That OP thinks he’s going to get something out of his amateur interviews that spiritual leaders and actual academics haven’t already put into a book is laughable.
"Either way, though, the fiance should have handled this better. For example, asked for photo evidence, ect. If your fiance is away for three months, it's not fair to him to expect her to live with roaches if they are real for three months until he comes back, just on the off chance the roaches aren't real.

My suggestion though is to talk to the landlord, including photographs and bringing the landlord into the apartment to see, maybe after the ""use mom as a set of eyes"" if mom and the OP are comfortable with that. Might be a good idea to have mom there when the landlord comes in, as well, if the landlord is aware of the mental illness. "
"My younger brother also had a super abusive girlfriend for almost 5 years. She isolated him to the point where even living in the same house (he was in highschool when the relationship started), he would not come out of his room if she was there... Not because they were banging... But because she told him if he went up to the kitchen to get a snack that she felt he was abandoning her. Seriously, in the 5 years they dated (several of those were when my brother and I lived in the same house), I think I actually only heard her speak on 2 occasions.

When he finally left her, she told him that he would never find anyone who loved him (this brother, in particular is my favorite. He's always been soft spoken, gentle, kind, generous, witty and one of my good friends along with being my brother). He was broken by that venomous comment for a long time. Thankfully, he's getting married at the end of this summer to his perfect match, who is his exact opposite in so many ways (loud, boisterous, terminally klutzy, demonstratively affectionate, extremely extroverted), but they both have the same sweet, kind, loving, fiercely loyal qualities that will serve them well."
"Get your dog properly trained.

There is a risk this situation could happen again with someone that isn't your parents and the consequences may not be as forgiving. Unfortunately when dogs bite it may not be the dog's fault but that doesn't mean the dog won't be punished. Keep your dog safe. If mom provokes dogs, don't let her visit your dog. Heavily supervise interactions others may have with your dog.

If your mom is trying to make you choose between her or the dog, she's either being incredibly manipulative (especially if there is a history there) or this is a sign that your dog really does have issues that you need to work on asap. If they don't want to visit and prefer to avoid the dog, go to a restaurant or public place to visit from here on."
Wow I wish I read this when I was on the road back after some toxic relationships. Exactly how I feel now in my 30s as opposed to feeling insecure and defeated in my 20s. It’s so well put I want to hang it somewhere.
"I’m so sorry that he’s done this to you. My guess is that he met someone else - decent guys don’t generally suddenly turn into heartless assholes with no explanation. 

There are two possibilities here and you should prepare yourself for both: you’ll never know the whole story or the real reason why; or you’ll find out he met someone and will be sickened to find he’d been cheating on you for some period of time. 

The only thing you can do is accept that it’s over, regardless of the reason. An explanation would be nice, but you’ll likely never get it. Focus on yourself and healing a little every day. Treat yourself - massage, haircut, weekend away with friends, whatever you need. Allow yourself to grieve, but keep an eye on letting go too. It will get a little better every day, and someday you’ll be able to look back and be glad that you didn’t marry someone capable of this level of fuckery. "
"I agree with a lot of what you’re saying, but it can still bother someone even if they don’t have feelings for he other person. Prolonged feelings of rejection are often more about the person being rejected than the person doing the rejecting. I think that is a pretty key reason for op to go to the wedding. And unless there was abuse involved, wife should consider if this is a hill to die on—what are family gatherings going to look like in the future? I say this from the perspective of someone who is no contact with her mother, so I know the value of self-care in family relationships for sure."
"&gt;But here, they don’t seem to be treating the wife like someone who matters - **as far as I can see, they haven’t acknowledged her feelings**

They have and like most of us on Reddit they feel his wife is being prideful and petty as fuck about a break up that happened ten years ago in college.

There really isn't any ""sides"". OP's wife and this guy dated. They had a messy break up. Wife was understandably hurt (at the time). But it's ancient history and to ""boycott"" her SIL's wedding over it is overreacting. To want her husband to also fail to attend his sister's wedding in inexcusably immature.

OP's wife made herself look bad by her tantrums and unreasonable demands. She needs to get over herself and apologize for reacting the way she has. To her, the fiancé is frozen in time as the jerk who dumped her cruelly, but people change a lot over a decade. She didn't even consider getting to know him as he is *today*. She instead went full on vengeful Ex.. not a good look!

"
"&gt;but I was also being disrespectful of my father and my mother when I promised them I would not sexually involve myself with my boyfriend.

No. NO. Nononono.

You were NOT being disrespectful! Your sex life is YOUR business and nobody else's! Your parents included. They have NO right to that information to begin with. THEY are being disrespectful of YOU and YOUR RIGHTS.

Work on getting independent and moving the fuck out of this dumpster fire of a family ASAP. And if they bring up your sex life again tell them it's none of their business. "
Has your SIL had issues with food in the past? That's the only logical explanation I can think of. 
Do you see that as a reasonable compromise? That they spend a fortune for a trip JUST because it coincides with a business trip? Why not save up for a vacation for the two of them unrelated to work?
Do you actually go on dates with your wife?
Idk if you're joking but if OP does this it will be attributed to her mental illness.
"Yup.

Porn ≠ RL, but this is something else entirely. He *is* planning to cheat.

You *knew* he was a cheater - he cheated with you. What did you expect? That a leopard change its spots?"
"&gt; What the fuck should i do with this?

Off the top of my head I'd go with:

1. Don't date 18 year olds and expect maturity/trust from them
2. Break up and find someone more compatible with you"
"I am so sorry that your wife and her mother had to go through this. You can't choose your relatives, but you can choose your family - I’m glad your wife has a safe space in you. "
"It doesn’t matter, you are still diminishing the fact you are totally ignoring your wife’s feelings. Your wife, someone you should take the upmost respect because of your marriage vows to her, and not some friend who goes after married men. "
You’re never going to be satisfied with what anyone is telling you OP. You should respect your wife and dump your friendship with this cheater. How do you not understand where your wife is coming from.
"So you really weren't making plans to spend time with him after this 3-day trip, you were going to let him tag along as part of this group film night -- and it never even occurred to you to check whether he would even be interested in whatever film it was, let alone whether he would be free.  Apparently being in your orbit was supposed to suffice.

I really don't understand how why you thought that would be satisfying to him even if had been free.  It sounds to me that you would be happier hooking up with someone in this group."
"Alright, if you want communication advice:

""Friend, your new guy has been spending every night here since you started dating.  I would appreciate it if you guys would be a little quieter when you're ""together"", and if he wouldn't spend every night here.""

However, if your friend is as defensive, sensitive, and takes things as personally as you describe, then it's likely not going to end well.  So you're probably going to end up with a disagreement on your hands.  And, since you seem to not want to take advice on protecting yourself via a lease agreement, what's going to happen is you're going to be stuck with two people camping out in your house without paying rent until you evict them, which is going to cost you a lot of time, money, and will likely destroy any semblance of friendship you had."
"Bullet dodged. Consider the $400 well spent. I spent $50,000."
"The hormones are likely a real issue but she's more in control of this than she admits. She has the power to focus it and unleash it on a safe target, which means she has the power to remove herself from the situation and use other coping mechanisms. She likely needs therapy as well as medication here."
"There's always someone on these threads that tries to minimize unwanted sexual contact or sexual assault. He was asleep. She is begging OP not to tell her husband what happened, so she's not even really coming clean to the person whose boundaries she violated. She clearly doesn't feel that guilty."
"Christ, yes. I have a year and a half old hound mix (another high-energy breed) and he gets walked three times a day. Plus a rigorous playtime or two. OP, your gf should not have a dog. The poor thing must be going bonkers from frustration.

(My dog's asleep at my feet as I write this. Yay, tired puppy!)"
"You are being beyond ridiculous. You should invite her and stop being so petty and unfriendly. Maybe also work on being jelly, it's not a good look. "
"She did it on purpose. I honestly don't know how you are managing to stay married to your wimpy, spineless, mama's boy husband.  


I would have literally MADE HER LEAVE THE RECEPTION. Like get the fuck out."
"This. It also means he's protecting his wife from being taken advantage of by greedy, jealous people."
"You sound so great, can we be friends? "
"That is an old person thing, to be sure. We are going through the same kinds of hoops now with my 89-year-old MIL, who expects my wife / her daughter to spend $500 on air / hotel / Avis car, and fly 700+ miles, to come hang a picture or restock her fridge. At some point they don't understand inconvenience to others, or associated cost. They only understand their own up-close needs, or, in your MIL's case, that $40 is $40. I don't think it's malicious. Just natural, child-like self-absorption. "
"&gt; Can you get your roommate to let you tag along on a date to a coffee shop or somewhere that's not your apartment so you two can actually meet in a normal situation? He might not be as bad as you think.

He blew up at her (a stranger at the time) in rage, and beat on her car windows, over a damn parking spot (one that he had no claim to). Nothing justifies that reaction, and no sane, normal person reacts that way. So yes, he is clearly as bad as OP thinks.

OP does not owe him a second chance, and in her shoes I wouldn't feel safe or comfortable being around him even in a public/group setting."

Very short sighted coping method. Time to start asking questions 
"Legal Advice offers pretty bad advice sometimes, and they're often nasty about it to boot. But I doubt they're cops pretending to be lawyers. If they were, they wouldn't always advise not to talk to the police. It's the one consistently good piece of advice they give.

Edit: Said it backwards"
"I would also add that I think OP should stop calling it her “first miscarriage.” When you keep saying first it makes it sound like you think she’s going to have more miscarriages in the future and I think that’s a very scary thought for women who’ve experienced even just one miscarriage.

With that being said, I’m sure your sister will be very glad to have your support."
"This is how I interpreted this as well.  It’s obviously an unpopular opinion but I can’t think of why he’d need a prenup or even want one.  He has no assets, and whatever he accumulates in the marriage should be shared by both of them.  Marriage is a lifelong commitment and your life partner should share everything with you 50/50 and it seems like he’s trying to have a marriage where they both stay almost completely separated with their finances and assets.  It would turn me off if I were OP.  And the house purchase is a red flag as well and it does seem like he’s trying to have a home that he owns, and then he has the upper hand to kick OP to the curb at any point if he decides the marriage isn’t working out.  "
"Sometimes people do more damage to their partner’s reputation than they realized or intended.  It can even be simple things, like everybody wants to go do [X], but your boyfriend is feeling tired, so he says “nah I’m going to go home and call my girlfriend, she worries when I stay out late”; or some people are jokingly criticizing their partners and your boyfriend joins in, but he says something that sounds worse than he meant it to.  If he was doing that for a while, and they didn’t have any positive association with you, they could build up a picture of a bad partner, without him ever saying anything particularly critical.  

Alternatively, shyness can be mistaken for a superiority complex, though it sounds like their dislike for you is stronger than that really explains.  "

"My partner and I are both very overweight. I'm over 200lbs, and I think he's probably over 300.

We've both gone on a zipline this year, and he did a ropes course a month ago (we're going together this weekend).

We spent part of this weekend playing in a sky cargonet. 

We went to a trampoline gym in the spring. We stayed off the parkour equipment by choice (it was mostly kids anyway), and were placed in an adult group for dodgeball, but got to try everything we wanted.

We last went to an amusement park two summers ago. There were a couple roller coasters he couldn't go on, and two where we had to wait a bit longer in line (there's a row with extended seatbelts). (I'm not counting child-only rides.) We got to go on all my favorites.

We went diving last summer, including deep and night dives. No restrictions. I wear off-the-rack suits and BCD (vest).

Skydiving may be more strongly restricted, but you would be surprised about how many activities are available to people like us. In many parts of the country, our weight would be average."
"You're not answering the question though of ""how are you intense?"" 

That's what we need to know if you want help."
"Honestly, you probably would benefit from therapy. It's useful for people in abusive relationships to talk to a professional so that they can work through some of the issues arising from these kinds of relationships such as low self-esteem."
"Your bf does not want to marry you. He has no plans of marrying you. If you're having a hard time adjusting in Canada, maybe it's time for you to consider moving back to the US in a city that matches your politics."
We don't get much from OP but communication is a two way street. Has OP been asking his wife how the job search was going? Something major is being left out here.
"&gt; A spouse is absolutely not allowed to interview in secret for a position in. Another country and then say that either you come or your divorce. That is unilateral decision making and is completely unacceptable. 

The fact that this opinion is somehow controversial in this thread is legitimately mind-boggling. It is in no way, shape, or form acceptable to secretly and unilaterally decide you're going to move to a new country you chose by yourself with no input from your spouse and then tell them they can either come with you or your marriage is over. That's fucking atrocious."
"&gt; an affair ... isn’t a simple mistake. It’s a series of choices made over an extended period of time

THANK YOU.  So many people echoing the ""made a mistake"" line... maybe if she got drunk and slept with him you could say that (although even scenario likely involves more than 1 mistake).

Calling an affair ""a mistake"" as if it was one tiny lapse in judgement is all about minimizing what they did.

"I am expected to work nights and weekends if the customer requests.

"&gt;She was all about communication and being open and the second you are, albeit clumsily, she immediately throws it back in your face. It comes across that whatever 'honesty' she wanted was a very narrow band and that isn't exactly healthy either. 

Really? OP says his girlfriend is a healthy weight and that his criticism of her weight is irrational. So how is she ""throwing it in his face"" for getting upset that she asked for better communication, but got ""you're fat"" in return? Anyone would be upset by that. "
Hey man. I am sorry. It sounds you really are into this girl. But you might have just being a rebound for her. She is obviously still attracted to her ex and are still close. You did the right thing. I am sorry man. You will be better eventually. Just hang on. 
"Leave him to take care of the kids for one weekend and go to a hotel and switch off your phone.

"What? he had feelings for his ex-wife, broke up with his gf and then obviously met up with his ex-wife. Honestly, he did the best he could in this situation and I really don't understand how you consider this cheating."
"Yup. This. I get that OP doesn't like the thought of moving. But he doesn't have a lot of leverage when he intends to rely fully on his wife's income. That means they need to follow the money, and apparently the money is pointing to a job in Canada. 

Their personal reasons and opinions aside, they have to be practical and pragmatic if they want to enjoy a comfortable life on a single income. And that may very well mean moving for a job. "
"Agreed completely. I mean it makes sense if OP's wife just wants the expat experience, but if she is truly moving away to get away from the US's current racially-charged political climate, Canada probably isn't the right spot..... especially for those of native descent. 

Hell, as recently as the mid 2000s, there are stories of Canadian cops dropping off natives in the middle of the prairie in the dead of winter. The Saskatoon freezing deaths. "
In a marriage even if one partner stays at home they are still a partnership and should both have input into things like moving. You don't lose decision making rights by giving up your job to care for your family.
"&gt; I might be misconstruing this, but if not, get your ethnocentric thinking out of here. 

In her first paragraph, she says:

&gt;It's so, so hard talking about this issue because arranged marriages are unheard of in white American families. 

I understand from this comment that OP is a white, American, Western woman. So... this does have to be seen from the Western point of view."
You will never be able to win with these people.  I recommend you get out.
"&gt; I was the one who would be responsible for cooking, cleaning and groceries.

"What else would a 12 year old do with money? Are they really holding that against you? 

Regardless, 18 is legal adulthood in most places. You can open your own bank account. If your name is on the account, they can't stop you from interacting on the account either now that you're an adult. Also your money is YOUR money now, they can't tell you what you can or cannot spend it on. "
"It's not up to the sister to protect her brother's sort-of unhinged wife. It's not like OP's wife is quietly going around trying to cope with her past; she's ACTIVELY forbidding her own husband from attending his sister's wedding. This affects the sister! 

Why are you just assuming that the sister was going around gleefully spreading gossip? It sounds far more likely that news simply spread that OP and wife might not make the wedding, and family members reached out to ask why. At that point, the sister has 0 reason to lie and protect the wife. She'd likely tell the truth (fiance and wife has some past beef) and that's that. "
Thank you for the advice

"He understands. What he is doing is pressuring you to break the simple boundaries you've put in place.

Basically he thinks your ""no"" is subject to negotiations. That's a red flag in pretty much any relationship regardless of fwb status or not.  More than that it's a symptom of age gap relationships that are problematic. 

Basically,  he's a jerk, his inability to take a 'no' without arguing is a bad sign and his sulking is just plain unattractive regardless of age.  

OP, my advice? Find another FWB.  This one isn't worth your time and patience."

"Half of a couple who occasionally swing here  to tell you that your instincts are 100% right here. It's really gross that he is a) unwilling to meet you halfway on the sex you have, and b) even worse, trying to pressure you into sexual experiences you're unsure about.

The thing is that swinging can be risky. We had a foursome with another couple and well, I don't want to go into details, but the other guy did not conduct himself well. I had a rough time, but what made it okay is that my SO had my back entirely. It doesn't seem to me like this is the case with your boyfriend. "
"i don’t remember where i heard this from but “severe overconfidence often masks lack of self-confidence”, like i think she’s developed that as a mask to hide behind the fact that she doesn’t have work experience but is good on paper and lacks the social skills needed to be a team player. Everything she’s told you she did at her other internships are hearsay, you don’t actually know if she ACTUALLY did them or not or is just inflating her accomplishments to look good even to you.

You really honestly have *no idea* how it feels to have your future just erased like that. Your hopes and dreams...gone. You can imagine it all you want but that moment it happens and it’s real and there is nothing at all you can do... the funeral ends, and everyone goes home to someone except you.  I was told by tons of people how “I could never imagine moving on / I’d never get out of bed again” but when you have no other choice at all, literally no other choice, then you will only understand, and I hope you don’t have to do that.

"Criticising a man isn't the same thing as ""crucifying"" him, dear. Guys really need to tone down the hysterical overreactions they get in response to a man being criticised. Funny how they never scream about crucifixions, pitchforks, witch hunts etc when it's a woman on the receiving end of it. Believe it or not, men are not above all criticism. And no one is saying he's terrible for not wanting to see a sex scene so it's pretty disingenuous to pretend they are. They're criticising him for his over the top, homophobic and violent reaction. And yes, he deserves to be criticised for that even if he is a man."
"Why do you care?

Why are you wasting mental bandwidth on this enema nozzle?"
I had a bf of 3.5 years and would forget to introduce him to people I ran into sometimes. I'm socially anxious so I would be hyper focused on the brief conversation with someone I wasn't expecting to see and just.. forget I should maybe introduce the bf. But I'd never turn my back to him and let him just stand there twiddling his thumbs. Or leave him in the car or trick him into not coming to parties with me. What an asshole. This is MAJORLY disrespectful.
"Yeah I think your anxiety got you coming and going on this one: led you into drinking too much at first, and now it has you overthinking everything. I feel you; I get social anxiety too.

You probably weren't the drunkest person there last night, and you probably have classmates who are feeling embarrassed this morning, likely with better reason.

Nothing terrible happened, so try to take it as a learning experience and set firmer limits with yourself next time. Don't aoplogize or explain with your peers; assume it'll be fine and move on."

"I would not be down with living with 4 adults total

Why can’t the two guy rent a place and move in together? That part confuses me. Why is their only choice moving in with your boyfriend and you? 

Unless they want your boyfriend to subsidize their housing. Plus you’ll be the de facto maid. Nope. 

Just be straight up. We do not want to take on two additional roommates. There isn’t enough space. They can find a house share if they need more than the two of them to rent a place.

Enmeshment/leaning on one person for everything isn't healthy.  You unwittingly tried grooming her into a spousal support role.  She's a kid.

Even in the aftermath of offending and feeling regret for it you're being selfish.  You were *told* in a previous thread not to act on it, went ""You dont understaaand she's so pwetty"" and **one day later** you offended.  *One day*.  It didn't 'just happen', kissing is a deliberate motion especially when its' not mutual.  You didn't leave her alone when she needed space to decompress afterward because you wanted her to make *you* feel better about your guilt you rightfully earned, you've left ""like 50 messages"" when you know she wants to be left alone but you bailed on the house because you don't want to get into trouble with your parents.

You committed incest, you were selfish, you don't get a reset button for that.  You're damn lucky you have a relative willing to house you, take them up on that before you do something else stupid re: suicide because that will absolutely fuck her up with survivor's guilt.

The incel shit and rewriting the narrative to suit you (""it ~just happened*"" yeah no) absolutely set yourself up to fail.  You're not 'in love' with your sister, you just want to emulate a relationship (The leaning-too-much on a 17 year old for support) because you want to bang.  That's it.  Nothing deeper.

But one thing you need to realize is: what she did WAS NOT normal. Her reaction was not okay nor was it warranted. I'm not saying hitting her was okay, but in your defense, she had started the fight and you struck her out of a form of self defense.

I think you should check out some of the articles on r/raisedbynarcissists. They have a sidebar with links on how to help you survive living with a narcissist, and others can give a lot of amazing advice on there.

My mother is narcissistic and the same way. She had even manipulated cops into nearly getting me put in jail. If this is a normally reoccurring thing, then I suggest getting a diary and logging these events, getting photos of any marks she puts on you, things like that. Tell neighbors or friends so you have backup if you need it. Then call cps and get out.

No. An adult does not sit around and watch their friend try to sexually one up their SO and throw jabs at every chance they get. What the friend did was incredibly inappropriate. And Op was absolutely wrong to let it get this far. Her friend means her responsibility to draw boundaries. Quite honestly the boyfriend should have dumped her after her first blasé reaction to her friend’s inappropriateness. Nobody should be in a relationship with someone who sits by and watches friends/family actively manipulate and undermine the relationship. 
Exactly. I have two female members of my family who are proudly serving our country in the military. I also have a sister in law who is an amateur kick boxer.  Women can be powerful warriors.

This wasn't a random hookup, this was well planned, you've been taken for a fool for at least one month. The thing is, you can never be sure if this dude was the only one for the last 5 years. You can never trust her again after this, no fucking way dude. "

Don't make the mistake of staying in this relationship just because you want some reward for all the hard labour you've put into it.  You'll get no reward, just more hard labour. "

"&gt; She's been crying and begging me to forgive her and saying that she made the biggest mistake by trusting Emily was ok this entire time. 

This sounds like she is making this nightmare about her. She knew more than she was saying but kept quiet to protect herself. She thought Emily was fine. Was she in contact with her? Did she text her to make sure everything was ok when she was gone? She should have at least let Emily know her family was frantic. Did she? 

You have to decide to do whatever you want with your marriage; but if I was your brother I would not be forgiving because what your wife did was really unforgivable. "
"You shouldn't apologize. Listen, he's not right for you. If that's the same pattern that happens every time it means he doesn't really take into consideration your concerns and requests. He's immature.
After all, it's your decision in the end but my advice is that you should look for someone else."

"My boyfriend and I like to do that too, and he always gets super remorsefull when he realizes that he played a bit too hard! Sometimes he gets genuinely surprised, but he always apologizes right away. "
"You completely off base with this one. Honestly your bff sounds like a completely horrible person. How can you be blindsided by this. Would you be mad if your boyfriend brought over a bunch of friends and just sat around insulting you and he just told you to avoid them if you don’t like it? I’m mean it’s all on him for choosing to still be in a relationship with you, but I really don’t see how this is a big mystery when your friend is being so malicious in trying to break you up."
"Reading your comments, older and newer, can you understand her anger better now? Aside from terminating your lease abruptly, I think you were not a very considerate roommate and you should sincerely apologise for that - without qualifiers and without excuses. 

It's really hard, even for direct people, to say things to roommates, because you can't avoid them. You have to live there, and you don't want to feel awkward or hated in your own home. I think a lot of the choices you made were selfish and you didn't take her feelings, or rights as another (original) resident, into account. And now, hopefully, you can learn and grow from this, but your friendship may not survive or stay what it once was."
"Same. I've only permanently deleted a handful of pics in my life. I'm super sentimental and hoarder-y about that stuff. I still have all of my pictures of my shitty ex and with my amazing ex. But I almost never look at them. Maybe once a year or 2 I'll flip through some. They're just there. In my ideal world, my future boyfriends would delete and throw away everything related to their exes but that's not realistic or fair. Keep it tucked away. Never mention it to me or show me. And don't skim through them all the time. Mementos can exist. Just... away from me and us"
"&gt;Honestly, what should I do

Lawyer up to arrange child support and and a custody agreement.  You might consider counseling just to help you stay the course as you get out of this dysfunctional relationship."
"Since love isn't enough on its own, why are you still in this relationship? You can't fix things with someone who refuses to try."
"This. This sounds like such a cognitive dissonance response to guilt. If he believes that she's overreacting about the injury, it makes the event less significant, therefore he has less to feel bad about. Doesn't matter whose fault it is, he was driving. I know my SO would be in a shame spiral over this even if it were clearly not his fault. If I were OP, I would try addressing the guilt first, then after that's on the table, let him know that next time he should channel that guilt in a better way. "
"That's why making help contingent on going over her budget with you might be a good intermediate step. If she asks for money, but isn't willing to review her budget with you (or more likely, to make a budget, because I'm guessing she doesn't actually have a budget, right?) to find the problems, then she's not really interested in fixing her situation as long as you're there to bail her out (or she doesn't want to show you that her ""budget"" prioritizes ""wants"" because she thinks she can count on you to pay for ""needs"" if things get dire). That's good information for you to have. I think it would be easier to cut her off financially once she demonstrates to you that she'd rather just take your money instead of having to do the one hour or so of work that would be involved in reviewing her income and expenses with you first. "
"Maybe she has, like, things to do. It’s kinda absurd and controlling to have expectations of people’s responses to stuff. If you’re this uptight about something like this, then how are you going to handle real issues of dating someone?"
"This.

Basically she has a way to behave that make her unemployable. She have to choose either to be her own boss and own her own company, or change behavior.

She have to learn to be humble and take her part of boring tasks untill she has shown her value. As of now all internship has told the employer she is not valuable to them so they dropped here. She unfortunately did not listen so she did not get the message.

Basically her education is worthless to all companies untill she learn to behave."
Lol what do you think happens when shes a mom at 16? Cupcakes and Rose's? If she wants to be an adult she doesn't need their approval. If she needs their approval shes not ready for the kid.
"No you are not. Unfortunately most ""friends"" we make are going to be this type of person. People will come in and downvote to prove that's true. 

Think about it, if everyone actually cared about everyone else, the world wouldn't be as grim as it is today.

What you are experiencing is the modern norm. 

Get out there, find people who matter. "
"I had a good chuckle at this, thanks. "
"I second this. In one comment OP says the imaginary friend is a she, another comment says the friend is a he. This indicates it might be something more complex than an imaginary friend. If the therapist says everything is good, then at least you have the comfort of knowing that, which might also make it easier to tell your girlfriend (if you decide you want to). If the therapist indicates otherwise, then it's a good thing you went so you can find a treatment plan/alternative coping strategies! "
"That is a highly disturbing lack of self control.  He used your body for a sex act without your consent.  He seems to know it was wrong, so it seems that he just thinks that his sexual satisfaction is more important than your consent or respect for you, despite knowing your history.

I'm sorry, but this would be a deal breaker for me.  I honestly can't imagine ever getting over the fact that someone who knows I'm working through sexual issues because of my history would violate me in that way."
"\&gt; Well this last Thursday (2 days ago) he told me that he met someone and would no longer be moving here because they are getting a place together but he would love for me to fly there on the 22nd so we can hang out as just friends and had the nerve to ask if I would still give money to get a car. At first I was like are you kidding me? I told him I felt lied to and played and just stupid and a fool. He told me that he couldn't predict meeting someone and all a whole bunch of BS.

WTF.

Yes please. No you are not petty. Promises are there..for a fuckign reason. And this is people's feelings he's messing with....."

Bro2 pays 25% of his cost, gets given the 2 25%s and your parents cover the difference to 100%.  That way your parents paid for 75% (as you and bro1’s 25% source is your parents) of each degree and the student paid 25%."

"They probably won't get the deposit back. However, if the videographer is worth anything, they should talk with you ASAP about what you want. This would be true even if this were something you would enjoy. You could tell the videographer to film other people.

If you're not comfortable even with this, I would sit down your sister and your mother to talk to them about how the videographer will not be there because the videographer makes you both feel uncomfortable. You appreciate the thought but that's not what you want. You can leave it up to them to cancel (I suspect they might not, though) or you can ask for the videographer's number to cancel.

If they refuse or things seems shady, I would make it priority on Monday to make sure the videographer gets sent home."
"Stripping th entire tree is taking the crop for the whole season, right? How the fuck are adults acting this entitled?"
"Ok, I will definitely make him go with me. Hopefully he is less argumentative today, I told him I’d be there to talk in a few hours. Hopefully he doesn’t get combative. I had an ex before who did this and turns out he was diabetic and had too low blood sugars, but it definitely wasn’t this wild."
"I'm 100% On Your Side here. What your neighbors did was completely out of line.

One thing I have unfortunately learned however, is that some people have no problem stopping on your boundaries. So for example, if I tell someone ""feel free to call me anytime"", most people would assume that I would mean within normal hours. I knew a woman who didn't have a job, and stayed up all night, so she thought nothing of calling me at 3 in the morning, giggling, because she was bored. I had to work the next day, and I would get upset when she would call me that late, but she would get offended, and say ""well you said to call anytime!""  She made me feel guilty, because yes, I did say that, but I assumed that she understood that I meant within reason. I assumed that she was a reasonable person who understood that I had a job, and could not stay up from 3 to 5 a.m. entertaining her because she was bored. She simply didn't see it that way. She kept pointing back to my exact words, ""you said to call anytime!"" 

So now, I'm a lot clearer with some people. Now, when my neighbor across the street asked if she could pick some apples from my apple tree, I said ""I'll be happy to bring some apples over to you."" That way, she gets some apples, and I don't have to worry about her being on my property when I'm not here. I made it crystal clear what the arrangement was. I no longer trust people to understand what the sane and reasonable thing is, because I've had too many people in my past completely push the boundaries of sane and reasonable. The woman who asked for apples from my tree used to come on to this property all the time and pick as many apples as she wanted, before we bought this property. So I wanted to make it clear that now that we live here, she can't do that anymore. It's not that we don't like her, it's not that we don't want her to have any apples, it's just that I don't want her coming onto my property anytime she feels like it, and taking as many apples as she wants. I'm happy to give her a ton of apples, in the amount of my choosing, at the time of my choosing, without her coming here whenever she feels like it. I wanted to set that boundary right away.

There's no way you could have known this in advance. This is not your fault. You made an absolutely reasonable assumption. Your neighbors took advantage of you. So now that you know, you're just going to have to set the record straight and being 100% crystal clear with them. You're going to have to explain that you wanted those cherries, and that you meant that they could have a few that were overhanging, but not all of them from the tree, and they aren't to come in your yard again. Outline your expectations clearly, and explain to them exactly what you want. That way, they can't come back to you and say that they didn't understand. It's unfortunate that you have to take this extra step, but it will go a long way in preserving better relations with them in the future."
"You need to consider that she’s not entirely at fault here. Yeah, it’s childish of her to use the silent treatment, but you also need to acknowledge that your lack of mindfulness at the mall led to some frustration for her.

"Speaking as a man, this is a gross overreaction. For him to break up with you over something as trivial as a text speaks to a much larger issue, in my opinion. It seems he may have secretly been looking for a way out and this innocuous issue was his way to conjure up an argument and exit without being the bad guy. The ironic double standard is what is puzzling me as he breaks up with you for not communicating, but then blocks your number as to not allow you to communicate. There's something much larger at play here."
"Shit happens. You've learned not to drink so much at a work outing (especially since you seem to only have a few drinks per month, let alone in a short timespan). Honestly I wouldn't bring it up at all. Yeah it sucks that it happened and is embarrassing, but you have to remember that everyone in the office has their own lives, and if they did see it, probably hasn't even thought of it again. Even if they do bring it up, it would be weird, uncomfortable and unprofessional of them to even mention it to you. Just make sure you look well rested and happy (aka not hungover) and go on with your day. It may be the #1 thing on your mind, but I can guarantee it's not on everyone else's"
"You're angry because accidents happened in your home while your husband wasn't there.  If he was at work, or got called out to a fire, you wouldn't be angry with him for not being there, would you? 

I understand very well how frustrating it is to need something and have DH not answer, mine leaves his on vibrate and leaves it on the table while he's in other parts of the house. 

Banning him from seeing his cousin isn't the answer though.  And the screened call sounds like he was driving, since he got home so soon after, and that's a safe behavior.  Ask him to be more mindful of his phone while he's with cousin, but seeking him to cut the man out is unreasonable. "

"Do you police his wardrobe? No? Then why is he the ultimate authority on yours? That's rhetorical, btw. You're not responsible for other people's thoughts or eyeballs, and yet your bf is making you believe that you are. That says a lot more about him than it does about you. 

Don't let him do this to you, it's a mind fuck, and the hallmark of someone so pitifully insecure that he needs you to manage his issues for him. Not your job. Decline to do so, and wear whatever the hell you want."

You are 31 and married. You have no obligation to continue having a miserable life due to your toxic mother.


Find out terms for you that work, and if she doesn't abide by them by calling too often or yelking at you, simply cut off the conversation and hang up. Rinse and repeat.


Make the terms of contact very clear to her.


Just because you were a doormat for so long doesn't mean asserting yourself now is wrong. On the contrary. Be strong and brave and stand up for yourself.


In the end, you don't live for your mother. You live for yourself. "
"Your friendship sounds incredibly unhealthy and manipulative. Depression is awful, but it's not a justification for controlling someone else's life to that extent. He's treating you like some kind of therapist-slave-boyfriend.

Ultimately, you're not even doing him any favours by enabling this behaviour. "

"To guess at his reasoning, it could be that he simply isn't tempted and so genuinely doesn't bite on the implicit threat. It's completely disregarding her feelings, but perhaps he's just not biting in any way, and he regards blocking to be an invitation to escalation.

"She disregards your rules and even stole your wedding ring and watch??? Wtf????

Demand that she give your stuff back and tell her that you feel beyond disrespected and that you are giving her a maximum of one month for her to get a part time job and contribute, or get out. She can get a part time job and find roommates if she won't respect you and your house rules. I'm literally being serious.

I'm all about loving family and helping others in times of need, but what family STEALS sentimental and expensive items from their relatives and completely ignores all of their rules? Your sister needs to grow up, and you really need to show her some tough love. Grow a spine and stop being walked all over because you're too afraid to spell out your boundaries. 

I'd also protect your remaining tangible AND intangible assets if I were you. Keep your wallet and cards on you at all times.

I'm sure she didn't mean to offend you and she probably felt embarassed you thought your husband could go. 

I would go and have fun. It's free food and drink, you won't cause any tensions with your friend and you may get to know your co-workers better.

"&gt; she is otherwise super kind and sweet

I'm sensing a pattern of excusing deeply flawed and problematic behaviors by deflecting to (what you perceive as) that person's virtues.

Your ""friend"" specifically helps construct scenarios with the intention of making you miserable, and then invites people over specifically to turn you into a spectacle...and you're calling her ""super kind and sweet.""

Your boyfriend is so obtuse/unobservant/ignorant that he throws you a party you specifically told him many times you absolutely didn't want, and then later acts so hurt about his foolish mistake (which he calls ""you bamboozling him"") that *you* end up apologizing profusely to *him*...and you call ""the most loving, caring, labrador of a man"".

""Super kind and sweet"" friends don't go out of their way to hurt and humiliate you.

""Loving, caring"" boyfriends don't ignore your express wishes, and then accuse you of tricking them and throw themselves a pity party when they realize they messed up.

I'm not going to say you should break up with your boyfriend, and/or cut your friend out of your life. But I think you do need to start showing a bit more backbone, and stop being so forgiving of harmful, toxic behaviors."
I'd add the caveat that they should simply show up with the police. I'm a vet tech and have been privy to situations where a person killed a pet rather than give them back. They need to use extreme caution. The friend's behavior is alarming.

Maybe you've seen this modeled by people around your, or maybe you've picked this up from terrible romantic fiction, but the times we are selfish and cruel to people closest to us should be exceptions, not the norm, and thinking that's standard behavior is really opening yourself up for so much abuse.

We should be at our kindest, most supportive, most vulnerable, most loving, warmest, most curious and open, most willing to lift the other person up.

"So when I was growing up my mom did not like:

Harry Potter, Power Rangers, Spice Girls, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, Digimon, and a bunch of other things I can't remember. 

If she had let me explore these things for myself, talked about the aspects she didn't agree with, and let me make my own decisions, I would have lost interest in a bunch of them, thought more critically about what media I consumed, and had a deeper relationship with my mother.

Instead I depserately wanted to watch or read all of these things, felt left out at school, watched things at my friends house and hid it from my mom, resented my mom, and eventually, when I went to university, I was so behind in Harry Potter that I skipped class to read it on occasion. (I was also not ready for university, but thats a whole other story). 

I completely support helping your children navigate through what is age appropriate and what is not. But through my experience, banning something you don't like is actually counter productive. 

Working with children now, I usually say things like ""I don't like..."" Rather than ""we don't..."". Because it still gives them agency. It allows them to make the choice, or at least to practice making their own choice, rather than someone telling them what to do. 

For example, today children were pretending to shoot guns with toy blocks. My place of employment has a no gun-play rule, as we have staff members who have actually left areas of conflict. So I said ""friends, I dont like that game, it doesn't make me feel safe. What else can you do with that toy? Can you make a long road on the ground?"" This also lets them practice empathy, which is important! "
Wow that story is FUCKED. UP.
"The thing is, if he acted like this when you were there, how would he have acted if you weren't? That's what I keep thinking. That and the fact that it takes a hell of a set of balls to just assume that acting this way in front of your fiancee's brother is ok with no prior warning or conversation - that makes me think that he doesn't see this behaviour as excessive or wrong in anyway.

So yeah, I would definitely say something to your sister, you'll either find that she is 100% ok with this (which is why he sees nothing wrong with behaving like this), or you'll save her a lot of heartache down the road."

What positive outcome do you expect to come from a discussion with BIL?
"Dude, break the fuck up.  You may have invited yourself but he gave you the green light to go ahead and come. You should have been blaming him for not keeping a seat for you - he DIDN'T.  Now he's pulling the ""I love you, I'm sorry but actually it was all your fault."" Lol no. Dump him and be grateful you dodged a bullet."
Lets say he gets his drivers license. Do you really believe he'd start driving? My guess is probably not. He sounds like the type of person that lets everyone else do everything for him. I personally couldn't be with someone who didn't have their drivers license and were perfectly capable of getting one. You have every right to feel the way that you do and quite honestly he could be a danger to you for not having his license. Say something happens to you when you are with him out in the middle of nowhere and you can't physically drive? Is he going to drive you? Probably not...
"Like, I genuinely believe that SHE believes that she was doing something sexy for her man... cause really there's no other explanation. In her eyes, the letting the photographer cum on her face was ok? But OP said she's shy? Doesn't seem shy to me? 100 sexy photos. God damn sometimes I would have to cry for 1

\[Edit\] holy crap yeah I did not realize OP was a woman, WHAT!... Still valid point though xD"
I'm sorry but common sense should have kicked in if her story is legit..... if a male photographer wants to masterbate and cum on my face (as I'm there taking photos for my significant other) I'd leave and call the police as this is very unprofessional and possibly be classified as sexual harrasment/assalt. Are you sure this is all that happened during the photoshoot?? 
"I agree with this. The situation really sucks, OP, but in the long run your sister’s well-being should take priority over your relationship with possible-future-BIL (I say possible because who knows how it will end if you tell her). 

Plus, imagine a scenario where he exhibits this behavior years down the road, perhaps when they have built a life together, have children, etc. - though it would in no way be your fault, I’d imagine it’d be hard to keep yourself from feeling guilty about the “what if.” If you tell her now and she chooses to proceed with that knowledge, at least she knows what she’s getting into. If you don’t, and god forbid something awful happens down the road, you’ll likely feel as though your honesty could have prevented it. 

I wish you heaps of luck - I know this can’t be easy to navigate, but I genuinely think your heart is in the right place. "
"Tell her. I'm marrying my SO because he is a wonderful, straight-up guy with high ethics who I strongly believe will be the most supportive, faithful, fun partner and father on this planet.

I chose to quote this single word, to highlight the fact that it does not belong in your vocabulary any more. You are legally an adult. You can do whatever you want. You will face repercussions. It will not be easy. But is the struggle of leaving worth dropping ""allowed"" from your vocabulary? I think it is.

"Thank you for posting this, esp as someone who actually was on a Contiki tour. I've traveled a lot, but never did Contiki because...well I knew what it's reputation was and wasn't into it (plus I read it was a bit of a financial rip off)

If OP didn't know about this she might want to look into a different group if she's not into the party scene. If she did, well then good for the boyfriend for dumping her. You don't douse yourself in kerosene, dance around a bonfire and then complain your partner is saying you might get burned, why doesn't he trust me?"

You're interpreting all of these things as a preamble to a proposal instead of letting them be what they are. Your expectations are what are causing suspense. Maybe he thought a photoshoot would be a cool idea. Maybe your parents wanted to be present because they paid in part for the gift. Maybe he talks to your dad because he has a good relationship with him. I don't fucking know. But what I do know is that by framing every single thing the two of you do together through the lens of expecting a proposal, you're setting yourself up for disappointment, putting a ton of pressure on him, and preventing either one of you from being able to just enjoy spending time together.

And yes, she has every right to be angry with you.  She has no way of going home alone, she is blind and in a strange area.  You continually allowed your friends to insult her right to her face.  The supposed defense that you said things back at them here and there is pitiful.

"He  does need to stop doing “proposal-like things.”   But he should not  propose until he truly deeply, 100% wants to.  He needs to stop engaging in discussions  about time frames  and such.  He should propose when he wants to.  She should tell him when she is 100% sure she wants to marry.  She can ask him.

But she needs to stop talking about “when he proposes” and just decide for herself whether she feels patient or trusting.  Deadlines mean, “if you don’t do it by this date, you failed.” No man (or woman) should capitulate to arbitrarily imposed deadlines over a decision like this.  "

My wife would make a trade, not realizing that one ""insignificant"" trade would literally win or lose someone the game, whether it was me or someone else. One of our biggest fights was when she was basically out of the game, and I and a friend were roughly even, and she gave me the game with a few unbalanced robber moves. I like to win, but not when it looks like she is helping me. She would get mad at me that I didn't help her. I would get mad  at her about friends not wanting to play with us because we didn't play fairly.

I had no money, and 11 years later, I have only just managed to get back across country to empty out the storage unit full of stuff that I couldn’t afford shipping to bring with me.

Even if it is true that most people don't marry the person with whom they've had the hottest sex, it's respectful to keep quiet about it.

I think you should just take it slow, maybe ask if he wants to get a cup of coffee together? Even though you live together, you can try to do things the usual way. Talk, get to know each other, share things about yourselves. I hope he shares the desire to be friends with you as much as you do. It's strange, you would think two people in the same situation would want to work things out to make your lives easier, but he seems to be silently enduring things on his own. "
"Right now think about your actions today which can be watching trash tv, eating and drinking water - just try and get through today (and you will, you are stronger than you think). Allow yourself to cry and feel rubbish, that's normal! Feeling better comes naturally, it won't happen straight away but it will happen, trust me. 

There's no quick answer for getting over a break up, just know that you will get over it.

He probably will never explain it which sucks now, but you will soon look back and think 'meh, what a sucky guy he was'. "
"&gt; OP I come from a culture where arranged marriages are a thing - and this situation is entirely NOT normal

To be fair, you probably come from a culture where arranged marriages are done for socially established reasons. OP clearly is not. OP's marriage is a more traditional one, in the sense that it is done for political and economic reasons where the marriage's sole purpose is to cement those alignments. 

Historically speaking, OP's experience is *entirely* normal for those kind of marriages (and those kinds of marriages were the norm in many societies for thousands of years). 

So, your experience isn't really relevant, even if your advice is solid. In the biggest societies still using arranged marriage, the goal *is* the happiness of the people involved, and there's a feeling (right or wrong) that immediate family members can better judge that. OP's wedding, their happiness is *not a factor at all*. So, OP can't rely on family members helping. The union itself was the goal, not the happiness of the people involved."
"The fact is women are perceived and treated differently from men. 

In addition the employer has said: no non employees in hotel rooms or vehicles provided by the employees. That says to me something happened in the past with someone’s SO/spouse that tagged along and there was an incident, the lawyers and the insurance adjusters got involved and the employeer does not want that exposure a second time."
"Dude... if she makes more than you... its likely the courts will award YOU support. And for the love of all that is holy GET A LEGAL CUSTODY AGREEMENT! You cannot trust her to always ""let"" you see your child. Its not up to her! Its your right!!

Do not do this without your own legal counsel!!"
"It's not that you're texting something inappropriate. It's that it's inappropriate to be texting, let alone texting constantly the object of your ""lust"" . The object over which you start to rationalise being 'polyamorous"" while excusing your lack of resolving this."
"I would just sit her down and talk to her yourself. 

“Look. I can’t watch you get another animal and treat it the way you treated the others. Dogs are not meant to be locked up for more than 8 hours. Being in a kennel at night and then during the day is just too sad for me. I can’t watch that. If you get another dog and lock it up for 10+ hours I am going to have to call animal control. You either hire someone to come walk and feed your dogs, take your dogs with you when you go places, or I’m doing something about it.”


It sucks to have to be mean in these situations, but I would say this would be the one time when being direct is easy. This was fucking infuriating to read and if you let her do this again without really really saying something, you are awful by association. "
"Dear god I missed that bit of isolation. Yeah, this guy is going to be terrible once they're legally bound. Get out while you still can, OP."
"That's my take. Who cares if he talks about the French Revolution to the parents? People tend to share their interests with people they've just met, to get to know each other better, to find common ground, or to just talk about interesting shit. And not everyone finds the same shut interesting, so in polite conversation there tends to be a lot of nodding politely and eyes glazing over, etc. I wonder if OP has some social anxiety or other social hang ups and is projecting then onto her bf. "
"What?! This is the pettiest thing I've heard of in....ever. She dated the guy 10 YEARS AGO. In college. And she's married now. She's been with her current spouse for 5 years. She wants to boycott her husband's sister's wedding! This is dictionary definition levels of fitting for the word ""petty""."
If I had a friend who was about to hit that kind of slog I would feel pretty bad about asking them to do anything that wasn't 100% necessary. And being a bridesmaid isn't 100% necessary.
"Because he has this vision of himself on this trip, and his wife is ruining his deep philosophical pondering images. "
I petsat using Rover when I was unemployed -- it's definitely not going to get you lots of money (unless you can sit animals in your apartment/house) but it definitely helps. I would sign up for a few different services (listed in other comments).
"I don't expect you to be cleric-level knowledgeable. I would hope that you care enough about the  traditions that you'd take time to learn and engage with their rituals. You say you don't care about the day to day stuff as much as the metaphysical stuff, but you're missing a crucial detail: for many religious folks, the daily ritual is intimately connected with the metaphysical and ethical. You can't just gloss over that."
"Business is built on relationships. Good, bad, horrible, wonderful. Be human. That's just how I would approach it.

"
"Because she’s focusing on *her* reaction to what you’re doing, and not listening to what you’re telling her. "
"If you feel that your professional relationship with the wife is still decent, then I would put the harassment behind me &amp; ask her if she'd still be willing to be a reference for you. ""Hi Wife, I'm disappointed to not be watching your kids anymore but I completely understand that you are looking for a different personality/fit. Do you feel comfortable if I use you as a future reference or would you prefer not to be contacted?""

If you AREN'T comfortable using her as a reference, then feel free to highlight some of your husband's actions that made you uncomfortable, in a casual kind of way. ""Hi Wife! Sorry to hear that you're looking for someone else, but I wish you the best of luck. Just as a heads up, here are some things that made me uncomfortable while working for your family that you may want to address before hiring a new nanny.""

This type of approach is less likely to come across as a bitter accusation, which may leave her more open to hearing it. 

"
I bet that exact thing will happen. I'm amazed someone as impulsive as her was able to maintain a 6 year monogamous (I'm assuming) relationship.
"&gt; she can’t promise she won’t react in a volatile way when I come back.

Because threatening and blackmailing your spouse is oh so healthy."
"That may ell be so but if she is having *this strong a reaction* to someone she has no feelings towards and the event happened 10 years ago - she needs to unpack that in therapy and not expect everyone else to adjust their personal relationships to cushion her feelings.

From OP other comments it seems she is prone to extreme reactions in other situations as well so I think she needs to work on herself first....."
"May be she knows you are busy and didn't want to force you in a situation where you felt you HAD to come? You are making a lot of assumptions. 

Her wedding is about her. Let her decide who she wants and how. You are kind of over-reacting but I do understand your reaction."
"\&gt;   I've gone on something like 8 or 9 dates in the past 2 weeks 

Do you think maybe you're going for more of a scattershot approach than building a connection with one person?  You're going on one date and then you start obsessing over their responses?   How long are you giving them to reply before you start bombarding them with messages? 

Do you have any other hobbies?  Something to distract yourself with while waiting for a reply?  Other things to build your self-worth around than whether or not you get a 4th date.

Have you ever been to a therapist to help with your anxiety?  Read self-help books to manage it?  It's your anxiety, it's your responsibility to be suitably armed against it.  You can't shunt that responsibility onto other people, or, as you've seen, they'll get overwhelmed.

Remember, nobody (healthy) goes into a relationship wanting to become that person's life, which is what you're asking them to do when trying to force them to respond to your texts on your time frame.  I know it's difficult, and you feel like you've put yourself on the line (although with 4 or 5 women on the go at a time, I'm not sure how true that is), but you need to give them space to live their life while you're living yours!

Good luck, friend."
"For your dog's protection, if he is a nipper and reactive tell people they are not allowed to touch him until you say so and ONLY how you say so END OF STORY.  Laws will get a dog put down just because people are stupid and can't speak dog lingo.  He was likely saying as clearly as he could to leave him alone, but your mom was just too dense.  Next time the person may demand he get killed instead of threatening to stay in a hotel.

In the mean time try to do some training that tells your dog""I got this"" so he can relax, let you be dominant, and then get him some casual exposure to get him used to people.  It takes some work from what I've read. (Not a dog trainer.)"
She's 21... not really a kid.
"This isn't about the married guy, this is about the friend. If OP was friends with the married guy instead, the same advice would apply."
"I thought that, too ... I’m not so sure he was asleep and unaware. I wonder if his level of involvement is more than they are saying. "

Your post is going to be removed unless you change the slur. 
"From the comments it sounds like you haven't used guns in a while and he never has, which would give me pause on a self-defense weapon too.  Are you willing to go to the range often (I mean a lot) for target practice? Are you willing to do all the maintenance you need to do to keep the firearm safe for you as the holder?  Or would you be willing to keep something like a baseball bat/golf club handy?

Honestly, I understand being concerned about safety as a woman by myself (I've lived alone for most of the last decade).  But some of this fear is a little bit over the top, and you might want to consider attacking it at the roots in therapy.  I had a stalker ex-boyfriend myself and I needed therapy to get past it.  I am curious why you think a house is less safe than an apartment, since having other people nearby =/= safety, but if this house is really in that rough a neighborhood I would pump the brakes on moving in there."
I PM'd OP a link to an organization that arranges fosters for domestic violence situations. Hopefully they can help OP out.
"I hope she leaves you.  You're just going to hurt her again. Everything in your post points to it.  You didn't even bother going to see her.

"She’s a female ‘nice guy.’ She thinks you owe her a relationship/marriage/her fairy tale ending just because she’s decided she wants you. 

Cut contact immediately. "
"She sounds like a victim of sexual abuse; precocious sexual behavior in a kid that young is often an indicator that they've been exposed to behavior like that themselves. 

Somewhere she's learned that if you like someone, or if you're being ""good"" for them, you do these behaviors, and I don't think she learned this on TV. 

Before you go calling CPS on her mom, consider maybe unrestricted internet access or something is the source. Have her over for a play date with your son and see if you can ask her about some of the things she's been sending, if you're comfortable playing the ""cool aunt"" role. Sometimes it's best just to gather information. "
"&gt; I took his virginity and a lot of other firsts...I told the guy I was dating that I cheated on him with my ex, and I was no longer interested in him and wanted to be with my ex again

Wow, how cruel. "
Than why can't your wife come with you?
I'll get there eventually. Thank you!
"Picking from another post  *He promises to change, to get better, but never does.* 

Okay, its time for you to mean it. Its not enough for him to say ' I will change' and then do little to no work to do so. Time to sit him down, tell him you need see significant change, like seeing him make progress on his work/school within a certain time frame or that he will need to move out.

I know it seems like tough love, but otherwise you guys will lose what good you do have if he doesn't turn things around. The hard part is that this might not be something hes capable of. But if this is a deal breaker for you, stick to your guns. Don't let what he could be cloud your judgement on who he is now.  "
"Nope my brother lives with his SO, they're very serious (talking about possibly getting married and having kids soon) and my mom accepts his SO as part of the family"
"&gt;  We do spend time together but I spend more time with Anna - we usually spend most of the weekend together even if that involves going out with my friends. Anna is always invited. 

So...that's not how that works. How often do you spend one-on-one time with your girlfriend compared to when you have group outings that she's invited to? You say you see Beth WITH your girlfriend 2 -3  times a week...that's a lot.

&gt; I was there with other women and there were enough double beds if we all shared them. I failed to tell her about it at the time and mentioned that it happened after my return.  

There's no reason for you to be sharing a bed with another woman while you're in a relationship, dude. Come on. You know how shady this looks. And you didn't even tell her after you came back. That's pretty disrespectful. YOU are the reason your girlfriend doesn't like this girl. "
"Have you considered a dog? We had a break-in a few years ago and the police told us as far as intruders are concerned, a decent-sized dog is worth a dozen guns. "
So if you were the one sleeping and a male friend kissed you would you want your husband to tell you?
Professional drug Lord?
"Oh buddy. If you have essentially been bankrolling them for 6 years without ever asking them for any contribution... Brace yourself, there could well be a whole lot of kicking and screaming when you ask them to move out. You may find they're not actually the friends you thought they were. I hope it goes nice and smooth and they're cool about it, but it could equally implode in your face shockingly. So, just think about what you'll do if that happens so you can roll with it and not get blindsided if one or both of them suddenly turns on you as if you're the bad guy. You may even lose one or both friendships. When big change happens (death, marriage, moving), you often find out what people are really motivated by, and it can be absolutely alien to what you think you know about them."
"&gt; Is Jason saying (and your BF confirmed) that your guy had a visible boner during the night? 

Lmao I want to know the answer to this as well. "
"Or you can think ""Well, that's beyond the pale, even if I didn't explicitly say not to do it."" Because you can't actually cover every possible action that would upset you in advance. 

I mean, I think your overall advice is sound, I just don't comprehend ""Well, did you TELL him not to jerk off to photos of his ex while lying next to you?"" Because... No? Why would that ever be a thing you explicitly discuss before it happens?"
She says we'd be happier if I proposed months ago. I don't necessarily believe that. But I know I can't challenge it she's 100% certain of it in her own mind.
"We can't really know. There are women like that out there for sure. Will you find one? Hard to tell. We don't have a crystal ball. Generally-speaking, being divorced with kids is seen as a negative and there are more women who want their own children than women who don't but the older you get, the more acceptable it becomes and a single mother could even have a preference for a fellow parent (as you would understand her reality better). 

I would advise to remain flexible, maybe someone who likes staying home and reading/watching stuff/surfing rather than gaming (but who respects gamers) and also enjoys snowboarding/camping and the outdoors would be good enough, or perhaps someone who is a gamer but not a fan of the outdoors, but who is independent enough to have no issue with you going camping with friends or with the kids. I am not saying you can't find a woman with everything you said, just suggesting to keep an open-mind. 

As for whether your list is unreasonable, I don't think so. It's not a huge pool, but it's not unreasonable either. Good luck."
"I personally think it all depends on what people want out of life, and how they handle the fact that not everyone feels the same. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with seeking status or wealth, so long as you don't do bad things in that pursuit.

On the other hand, hearing some trust fund baby say that she ""believes in your potential"" after admitting your current job in pursuit of said potential embarrasses her? That's just classist snobbery, as that other poster put it. A glimpse at the way she sees the world.

Good luck, OP."
"“If you can’t accept me at my worst” doesn’t equate to “I don’t need to work on my flaws, it’s their responsibility to tolerate it”."
That's why I was so surprised when she said it.  I thought she'd have my back on this kind of thing.
"It does. If you read more about women like this, their precious baby boys getting married is a massive trigger for insane behavior.

If she wasn't over repentant, she's basically not a human being. I would freaking sob if I did that to someone, let alone my son's bride. Not be awful afterwards."
you should not be worried. Go back to concentrating on the match tonight. Its coming home 
Is he Facebook friends with a woman that he still fantasizes about? Or does he just creep on her page?
"Your wife is overreacting. You two are married, and that relationship was a long time ago. So why get pissed about it now? If your wife fails to see the logic in it, there is no point to try and get her to see it. Go to the wedding, support your sister, and move on with your lives."
"Alamo Drafthouse in Texas cracks the whip on this and I love it. They specifically say, “talk or text, you get a warning, do it again, you’re out, no refunds.” They’ve asked people to leave just for having their phone out, scrolling.

OP dont do what this guy is suggesting. It opens up the possibility of you getting in trouble for blackmail or extortion. 
So why stay with someone who doesn't respect you as a person? He sounds abusive and that he can only make himself feel good about himself by tearing you down. 
Sounds like you LOOOOOOVE drama
Dump him. He fundamentally does not understand or respect you or what you went through.
"But she has explained it, she mentioned that several times AND that her BF thinks she can make an exception or find a way around it.

"Hey, that isn't something to feel stupid or immature about at all! A game night is no longer fun if you have to sit around and spectate for hours and hours. I was married to a super competitive gamer who did something similar - we had a couple over and my ex knocked out the wife on like the 7th turn (it was Settlers as well - nobody wanted to play except for my ex and he had spent the whole evening nagging/whining at us so we did to shut him up) and he made a really big brag about it and she just grabbed her purse and shoes, gave me a big hug and said ""well, the evening was fun for a little while, thanks!"" and she and her husband left.

My ex was just utterly dumbfounded and couldn't get over what a ""sore loser"" she was. I tried to explain to him that if he wanted to take a fun, casual game night with friends and turn it into a stressful competitive, shit-talking feud, he really succeeded in doing so. His argument was ""I play to win, no matter what"". He felt it was far more important to win at all costs than to give a damn about a friend getting to be included. He never understood why our game night frequency dwindled to ""never"". He just couldn't fathom why everyone hated playing games with him...or why he ended up with zero friends after the divorce."
"why? i think he is projecting his dissatisfaction in his life onto you and your household. it does not ""need more than"" anything. that is not what ""need"" is. he may want something different (not more), but he needs to explain why. or, he needs to do it himself. if he wants you to do it, the minimum he has to do is articulate what and why. "
"Yeah but realistically if there is someone in your home that wants to hurt you, they're not going to wait even 5 minutes to let you unlock and load your gun. Anyone that thinks that a gun would actually help in the case of home invasion is fucking kidding themselves.

Also - how many home invasions actually happen in the US while someone is at home? And of those, how many result in the intruder doing anything but running away as soon  as the homeowner wakes up? This whole scenario that people imagine of a stranger in their bedroom ready to hurt them in the middle of the night literally never happens. People tend to break into homes to steal stuff - when they know or think the owner is gone. If they hear something, they run. People that break into homes don't generally want to hurt the people that live there (especially if they are strangers), they just want to steal some shit and get out.

A big loud dog is a way better deterrent than a gun."

"I agree and disagree. She needs to tell him because he deserves to know what happened to him. Then, as the true victim in all of this, HE  gets to decide how to handle it. Not to say OP shouldn't be part of the conversation, she should, but in a supporting role kinda way.  "

"Although elmuchocapitano could have phrased their comment in way that was more generous to your feelings, what they're saying is spot-on. If you value your relationship with your girlfriend and want to build a life with her, you need to show her she comes first - allowing a homophobic relative to dictate the terms of your relationship sends the opposite message.   


JustNoMil and JustNoFamily are littered with folks like you - folks who allow family members to walk all over them and their SOs - generally driving the relationship into the ground and causing the couple to split.  


It's not easy standing up to your Dad, but it's important for you to do it. The responses here are unanimous - your Dad needs to leave, and you need to learn how to deal with conflict enough to have this conversation with him, and start setting healthy boundaries that will allow you to have and maintain a successful long-term relationship with an SO.  


It's okay if you need help to take this step - if you need to talk to friends or other family or a counselor - but know that it is necessary for your well-being and future happiness.

I used to live in an apartment complex with many young families and international students. We cooked and ate together many times a week. It was perfectly normal.
"Dude, I ain’t a perfect person by any means (I have a shitload of flaws and I’ll be the first to admit it) but when my bf had an interview this week I ironed his shirt for him, helped him prepare with a “practice interview” and made him breakfast so his stomach wouldn’t make crazy noises during his interview. When you’re dating someone, you should be a team. Each person’s success has an impact on the other. If your gf doesn’t understand that, then she’s not ready for a serious relationship."
I was in a relationship like this with a girl who is THIRTY YEARS OLD. Yeah it ended. Not because she was awful. It ended because she couldn't have an adult relationship. She was an amazing woman and I'm bummed it ended but I want to be an adult dating other adults. It ain't going nowhere OP. Jump ship.

"I know full well how insidious it is and she *is* getting help, it just isn't working for her and that isn't necessarily on her. Which is why I suggested other forms of therapy, because a lot of people don't do research on different forms and so don't end up getting the full benefits. "
"Show your new boyfriend this post and have him read it?

Everyone is their own person. Let this new guy be himself without treating him like the ex."
"First off, there is nothing wrong with watching porn. Her reaction was uncalled for. My boyfriend does it and I see no issue with it as he is not cheating, sex is a work out sometimes and its okay to take care of business for yourself. 

Secondly, I think you did the right thing. She could have done much more in terms of physically cheating on you. And the fact that you asked her to stop and she still continues, you were in the right to break up with her. 

As for staying friends with her, I would give it time. She needs to reflect on the fact that she broke her promise to you. "
"&gt;For example: we went to an all day festival with friends, on the way home he got mad he didn’t get to sit in the front seat and he had to sit in back with me and another person we don’t know, he complained so much, I didn’t know what to do, I felt like crying. 1. The person in the front was bigger, my husband is tiny. 2. I sat in the middle the whole time without complaint 3. He would have left me in back with two people I didn’t know.

If I had acted like this when I was a kid I would've been punished for acting like a brat, and rightfully so.  It's absolutely inexcusable that an adult acts in this manner.

That said, I notice the three examples you provided are all travel related.  Not that this excuses his behavior, but is it possible he just hates travel or car rides?  I'm just putting this out there as a place to start assuming he's willing to grow up and address his childish behavior.

"Really bland, ""Hmm I'm not sure"" is a pretty safe answer to any rude question. "
"What u/floomby is describing is something called complex trauma. It's basically a form of PTSD that comes from growing up in an abusive environment (whether that's physical, sexual, or emotional). In cases of emotional abuse, the triggers are relational, i.e. fears of rejection or abandonment rather than fear of being physically harmed. But of course you don't know that you're flipping out about rejection or abandonment in the moment you're triggered, it's disguising itself as whatever the situation is that triggered it (i.e. a conflict with someone you care about regarding something unrelated). Also tagging u/twocupsoffuckallcops because learning about complex trauma changed my life, and it sounds like you're ready for that journey too. :)"
Seconded I have always bought my own bridesmaid dress and have never heard of the Bride paying for them.
"I've never heard of that organization before. I'll definitely be looking into it, I don't know if I can classify what I went through as trauma but it was definitely a dark part of my life. It'd be incredible to be able to have others I can relate to!

"Not clearing out texts is a rookie move. He wanted to get caught to cause a break up because he didn't have the guts to do so on his own.

"Oh girl.  I've been married for 17 years and Husband has **never** demanded that I blow him.  A man who respects you will care about your feelings and be able to put off his sexual needs until you are as enthusiastically ready as he is.  

Listen to me: *He punished you for not giving him a blow job.*  For a fucking week! **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY YOU SAID NO.** You have the right to refuse sexual activity for any reason. I see that you feel the need to justify your refusal (""Someone close to me died; I was constantly crying."") and that shows that you have internalized his entitlement to some extent.

This is not okay."
Listen to this. I've been with a man like this for 20 yrs. Screaming at you to listen to this!

He may have been a virgin or just very inexperienced like other have said an he felt very nervous and shy about the whole situation and was overwhelmed by it all.

Perhaps he knew he wouldn't be able to satisfy you, or the pressure was just too much and he had to bail. 

"
All of those instances do not mean he is obligated to sleep with you.  You are throwing a fit because you wanted something he didn't want to give.  Even if he is flirting with you it doesn't mean you are on a schedule to when you finally sleep together.  He can flirt with you forever and is still not obligated to sleep with you.

"You all could try to form together more cohesively as a team to consider what action to take. Maybe record his tantrums and show them to him later (maybe anonymously, if you're worried about consequences), maybe all going together to the HR person, maybe researching what your legal options are, maybe everyone standing up at once and yelling ""STOP!"" every time you witness one of his tantrums, or maybe inquiring to the medical board what constitutes ""unprofessional behavior"" for a doctor, and what action you should take if you're concerned that a doctor has some sort of problem that is affecting his judgement and treatment of people, or maybe you should just all look for new jobs. Right now you're thinking that if Kay leaves, that solves the problem. It will for her, but with guys like John, once his target is gone, he'll move on to someone else.

"Just my 2 cents, but even if the fighting is not directed at the kids it still hurts them a lot.

I have 2 alcoholic parents who would yell and fight (verbal and physical) every single day and I couldn’t wait to get the fuck out of there. I see some of their anger issues reflected in myself sometimes and I can’t stand people being loud anymore, even in a happy celebratory way. So in a way, it is bad parenting because there are secondhand consequences. They are 60 and still fight, but it’s all verbal now.

I don’t visit them or answer the phone anymore."
"She made a jab about the threesome 2 more times after the initial group announcement? Like, a jealous ex-lover trying to stake her claim? You need to talk to your BFF and find out exactly why she can't let this go and why she feels the need to poke at your boyfriend. "
"IMO, had you not walked into the bedroom, she would have had sex with the guy.  Clearly she was into him, and they were tracking / texting each other, if they hooked up at two different parties.

3 days later the guy, being in a relationship, dumped her, and she was devastated (not with guilt), and came back to you.

You're thinking of taking her back, because she's being completely honest, but is she?  Has she revealed any details that you didn't already know about from observation?  Has she revealed her texts to this guy, if they went beyond the kissing and groping that you observed, and what exactly she would have done in that bedroom?  It's possible she was honest with just the parts you already knew about, in order to placate you and so you wouldn't dump her.

If you also doubt that YOU are not a good boyfriend for her, then this relationship will be no fun:  you'll have to always watch yourself so you're ""a better boyfriend"" and also always watch and suspect her because she'll cheat.

I bet you as soon as you suggest taking a break, or a break-up, she'll hook up with the guy at the next party.  All the way."
"Her message of how lonely he must be is setting off alarm bells.  It could be innocent, but with this girl's history, and how she is already lying that she is in contact with OP... it's not at all.

"Yup. Or withholding partial salary. Or writing them up for disciplinary matters and starting a paper trail.

"Go the Captain Awkward and search for ""low cost mental health"" for a list of inexpensive options.

And while you are there, read through her voluminous archive about setting and maintaining boundaries, which will, I bet, be *really* helpful.  One example of doing this is declaring that you will nope out of any situation where he throws a fit:  at that field, for example, you would have gotten into the car and just left him.

But really, even if you get to the point where his fits just roll off your back...is that *good*?  You're still stuck with a toddler modeling the worst possible behavior for your child.

I agree, it's ultimatum time:  he goes to therapy and demonstrates very real change, or you're going to see a lawyer."

Yes, they are saving money and they should just pay the bill, however, you're not squeaky clean here. You had the same responsibility they did to talk specifics, and none of you did it. Plus, you and partner were probably the ones better equipped with the information to know whether their internet plan would work for you. 

I'm a high user too of internet data, but when I'm at someone else's home, *I ask*.  When I visit, I ask. When I house sit or pet sit, I ask.  I ask about it the same time I ask about how the thermostat is set, because it's just a basic household utility. If someone tells me the plan is low and I know that I won't be able to live comfortably on it, I ask them to please call in and see if they can buy extra upfront.

Which is what your friends would be wise to do now; Call in and see what deal they can get for the next month, 'cause it'll probably save 'em some money. 

Live and learn, but I'd suggest you not burn this friendship down over this. Nobody here is ""in the right"". You all messed up. "

"
"&gt; I obviously don't love him if I'm not willing to break through my anxiety and ask

"If he’s still acting oddly today then it wasn’t the alcohol and probably not a case of him being slipped something. You need to talk to him, but do your best to make it an “I’m worried about you” convo, not an “I’m mad at you” convo. If this is a sudden psychiatric problem then it’s important that you let him know that you’re fully supportive and want to help him. 

However, if he seems back to his old self today, maybe bring it up again in a few days once you’ve gotten some distance from it. If this was just a case of him being awful to you because he was drunk, that needs to be addressed at a time that you are both calm and sober.

And since he’s got someone else he’s probably spending a lot of time with them to make himself feel better. He’s possibly using the breakup for sympathy. I would be. 

I’ve been in his situation before. This is likely what’s going on with him. Believe me though, he knows he fucked up and is gonna have a rough time when he lets himself face it. "

Totally agree - best day ever was waking up to find my brother had let himself into my house and was asleep on the couch after leaving his abusive ex.  I always told him he would be welcome to come to my house if he needed to anytime of the day or night and he did just that.  He never went back to her after that.

&gt;I see a future with this man. We've known each other for quite a while and he's someone I want to spend the rest of my life with. 

But aren't you expecting *him* to change his mind?

You're saying ""I want to be with this man, but I don't want the future he wants"" which means that either you're going to be doing something you don't want to do, or you're expecting him to change his mind.

As far as I can tell, the only difference between you is that he's been honest about what he wants and you've pretended that you'll go away and think about it. What are you expecting to happen?

If you think that you can carry on having the relationship that you want at the expense of this guy's future happiness then I'm afraid that it's just not going to work."

"Here's the thing: your willingness to walk (if you are) is the only leverage you have.  Most people making big joint financial decisions want the other person to be on board, or at least willing to compromise or concede.  She's blown past that point.  

The thing is, if you say ""that's not acceptable"" *and then accept it* (by buying the house), all you've done is shown her that you don't really mean it when you draw boundaries and that if she just goes ahead and does whatever she wants, you'll eventually go along.

I get that you don't want to take the nuclear option and divorce, but speaking personally, I would absolutely insist that 1) You don't buy this house.  You put the house hunting completely on hold until you work out better ways to communicate about finances.  2) You get a full accounting of each other's finances.  This doesn't mean that you merge finances or are accountable to each other, but you should know what each other's current assets and liabilities are.  3) Insist on counseling before you start househunting again.

If one person has to get up to go to the bathroom during the movie, they get handed the whole stack of papers (because it's impossible to differentiate the slips in the dark). The person who had to pee last during the movie usually goes home with all tickets and the receipt.

It's too hard and too underpaid as it is to not have people in your life who at the minimum emotionally support your work. Additionally if you stay together to the point of living together, getting married, etc, you'll need someone who isn't challenging your earnings every time budgeting comes up. If he isn't willing to work through why he doesn't think the people doing the work you want to do deserve to be paid fair wages and adjust his perspective, it doesn't sound like being in a relationship with this person is worth the work on your part."

I bet if you get to know her, you'd be really disappointed. For one thing, would you really want a relationship with a woman who comes onto attached men? It doesn't say much about her as a person.

Saying that, you're not in the right mindset to get married. I think this is your instinct telling you what you're going is wrong. I know plenty of marriages where both people did think they were with the love of their life and that went wrong. How do you think it will go if you're not convinced? "
"Yeah.

OP I'm not here to bash you, in fact my heart goes out to you, but your reaction to all of this is not okay. The fact that you are not only not angry and disgusted, but actually helping them date...I'm just speechless. 

They're treating you with complete disregard. It's beyond selfish. They don't get points for not fucking in front of you. How this is supposed to go is your girlfriend says ""I'm sorry but I'm feeling confused lately so we have to break up."" and your roommate says ""Hey some stuff came up and I have to move out. I'll stick around/keep paying until you find someone else."" Then they go off and try to date discreetly, hoping you never find out,and feeling appropriately shitty if you do. 

What they've done is insane. It's not okay just because you don't realize how shitty it is. This is one of the most blatant examples of someone being taken advantage of. "
"On the one hand, yes, but on the other hand a person who cancels constantly and gets mad for you doing the same in return might not take it well.

I tried to break up with my therapist and did kind of an exit interview thing and wound up staying for another few months even though she really wasn't helpful.

Eventually I just called and left a message saying I wasn't going anymore and to please send her invoice.

She still wrote a letter saying she didn't understand, but that's just a foot in the door technique to get you to stay."
She sounds unstable and jealous. Maybe try and explain your side but if he doesn't want to listen the best you can do is say you're sorry and you'll be there for him when he needs you. It's shitty when our close friends choose shite partners but sometimes you just gotta wait it out
"That's bonkers. ""Let me, the person you are in conflict with, help teach you how to deal with conflict."" Wildly unprofessional. "
"Oh, come on, OP, you *know* what you need to do:

* Break up with her.  If she's ignoring you, then send her a letter or a text telling her that you are done, then BLOCK HER.

* Get therapy, at least a few sessions.  You say that you are depressed and anxious, and you want to be sure that these are situational and not organic conditions, first of all.  If they are a result of your relationship, then a therapist can help you develop the tools to deal with these issues.

* Mourn.  A relationship you set great store by was a lie.  It is a ghastly shock, *but it is in ashes.*  Grieving sucks and there's no way to shorten the process.

* Double down on social activities, even though you just want to crawl into a hole and die.  Join clubs, take up new activities, go out with friends, just fill your calendar with as much activity as you can fit into a day.  In a few weeks, you'll feel better and, as an extra added bonus, you'll have a more robust social network.

* Practice self-care.

* Don't pursue a relationship for awhile; let yourself fully grieve and heal.

You'll get through this.  Life always wins in the end.

  It's not controllable how tactful the Social worker will be in the home check, but one thing to note is that if they do deem the home to be neglectful-- CPS will always make an effort to find suitable care within the family before creating another burden on the already overworked system.

  I'd suggest reporting and trying to commiserate with your brother and his wife and when the conversation comes up, find a way to tactfully bring up the spare bedroom and allow them make the conclusion to ""keep them in the family"" so they can be ""given back"" at a later date. 

  That way when the family court system finds their home unsuitable for children (forever likely/hopefully) OP can blame it on the ""damn broken court systems"" and find a way to cut them out of your life/only have supervised visits for the foreseeable future until they get their acts together."

It's not acceptable for her to deflect, especially by accusing you of only caring about sex.  It's *also* not acceptable for her to deflect by having sex with you.

This has obviously only lasted this long because you guys not only live separately, but in different cities.

This is so vile, I hope you know that this isn't normal or something that anyone has to put up with.

"You did the right thing.  In my experience your situation calls for only one action - admitting/confessing/proclaiming your feelings and letting the chips fall where they may.  If she doesn't reciprocate then you go NC or live in your self-imposed, unrequited love-prison."

"Could it be a cultural thing? In some societies, for instance, people cum on each other’s faces to signify the conclusion of a real estate deal where the negotiation on closing costs went particularly smoothly. Wait, no. That’s not right at all.

If he’d been honest and said they’d messed around pretty seriously and he had a crush on her in the past, but didn’t tell you the explicit details, then he’d be fine. It’s concerning, though, that he used to have feelings for this woman who is around all the time and lied to you about their past. You have no idea if he’s still in love with her, but the fact that he lied sure indicates that she’s more important than you are. "
This is such good advice and I wish I’d heard this kinda thing when I first became sexually active. We *do* tend to think about sex in a very male-centred way.
"If it's no hardship for him to stop talking to her then it's fine. You asked for something, he gave it to you. Personally? I think it's unfair to ask him not to have any contact with a life long friend. If he is a good partner then he is perfectly capable of having this friendship without it becoming a threat to your relationship. I think it's better to trust your partner to take care of your relationship then to limit them because of insecurity. "
Do it anyway. Initiate. Schedule it if need be. Make an effort to get into the right headspace. Your husband does not want to be loved platonically by his wife.
"&gt;Guy told me he loved me and could picture having a family with me within the first month of dating. I was taken aback by this, and wasn't quite to love yet, but absolutely reciprocated saying it back.

This is what a red flag looks like.

&gt;But there were some red flags: a few months in I got worried about his level of commitment; he kept saying he wasnt sure if he wanted kids etc.

The fact that this is what you think the red flag is speaks volumes about your approach to this relationship.

Guy raised devoutly Catholic secretly dates married woman with kids, moves way too quickly, ends up dialing it back as he comes to his senses about what an appropriate timeline is, then flees the relationship when he realizes he committed way more than he actually could carry through with. I mean, what more information do you need? He probably needs therapy to learn how to Relationship as a non-Catholic, but it isn't your problem anymore. You have no future with this guy and you never actually did, pack it up and move on (probably by making more friends so that you aren't putting all of your emotional eggs in one basket and moving way too fast with guys who are terrible at relationships).

Yes. This.

"I don't think someone's yard is 'the perfect place to let a dog run and play'. They have their own yard that would be a much better place, and there's plenty of places to walk a dog around here without cutting into someone's back yard.

What. The damn. Hell. I'm not against tail docking or removing dewclaws and what not, but she took your dog, the dog you put into her care with the 100%, totally reasonable expectation of ""You will make sure my dog doesn't starve or get hurt"" and not ""Please, feel free to act as if my dog is your own and remove part of his tail!"" and *cut off part of his damn tail*.

Oh hell no, girl (or guy, IDK) you have every right to be mad. Sadly though it really seems like she is the ""I am older, therefore must be wiser too!"" type of person. The only onus of control you have here is to not allow her near your dog again and never let her have an iota of control on anything you hold dear.

Not worth the constant fear of ""What will she do to my dog/my child."" Hell, don't trust her with your house plants. She might read boiling milk makes plants grow and murder all of them.

Edit: Also, I realize, she either lied to the vet who performed this surgery and said your dog was her's, or the vet didn't care and just did it. What the damn hell!"
My partner has cats. The dog is mine. I do all the caring for Rex as my partner isn’t a huge on caring for dogs. He loves Rex and helps me out but I have eternal poop duty. 
It's hard to understand why someone would do that to a dog that isn't theirs.  
"I see on here that you don’t want to take legal action just yet. I understand and I completely get it, but if the time comes when you are ready to do so (probably check the statute of limitations or have your partner do it), check in with the vet. Had she claimed to be your dog’s owner to get the surgery? Because if so that’s a whole other and larger can of worms.

Wishing the best to your dog—hope he keeps still and feels better ASAP."

"What’s worrisome to me about your post is not your feeling but how you and the other husband tried to “teach her a lesson” instead of discussing it with her calmly and rationally. It sounds like you intentionally set her up to fail so you could have an upper hand. It sounds like she may be aware you do this and that you underestimate your wife’s intelligence.

"Or maybe you're the one out of the norm. Not that it's a bad thing, just that sometimes your experience is far from universal.

Almost everyone I've ever known of both genders has talked about these kinds of feelings in early relationships. Sometimes they don't realize it until later, because during it's all infatuation and ""I'm 16 I KNOW I LOVE HIM AND WILL LOVE HIM FOREVER"" and other teenage shit. But eventually they're like ""Damn. I had no idea how to be in a relationship and I covered that ignorance and insecurity by inappropriate school hallway PDA and making out in every single car backseat and lots of melodramatic fights because we didn't actually know how to communicate like adults yet. Man I learned so much"". 

The difference is OP is old enough and mature enough to know that she doesn't have the experience yet to necessarily recognize what is normal and healthy, so I think she might be feeling it more acutely than teenagers who vaguely know something is missing but aren't mature enough to dig into and figure it out."

I know this is petty of me but really this should have made your day. You are getting along just fine without her and she obviously feels this huge hole with your absence if she is willing to devote this kind of time and effort into telling you off. "
"The purpose of dating (unless it's just a fling) is to see if you are compatible with your partner in the ways that matter to you. Even if you are not aligned with a belief of theirs, it should not be in major conflict with your values or seriously perturb you. Obviously, this does bother the OP (as it should, in my opinion), so they should not date. 

Irrational beliefs lead to irrational behaviors. What if they are together on Christmas Eve, along with several other friends who don't know she believes in Santa Claus. She comes out with a plate of cookies and a glass of milk. Everyone is like, ""Oh, I'll take a cookie!"" and she frowns and says, ""No, this is for Santa."" Crazytown.

I mean the dude definitely played this situation the wrong way but is he really being unreasonable?
He just doesn't want to be in the present sitting at home alone thinking about his loved OP while she might be getting hammered down. 
Matters not if it's going to happen or not. Nobody wants to deal with that stress and judging by his response it seems you two are not unfamiliar with the subject. 

Bottom line, don't be selfish, put yourself in his shoes. If you want to chase your dreams then do so but understand that relationships are a two way street and he doesn't have to agree with your decisions. "
"&gt;I forgave her for this because it was only a kiss and she stopped it. 

You need to take it more seriously.  Passionate kissing is a violation of her commitment to you.  She may have stopped the kiss but it was not an incident that happened out of the blue.  Her interaction with her co-worker had been inappropriately close for some time and led to that moment.

What is her game plan now?  Is she going to take steps to distance herself from this guy or are you expected to just take her word that nothing will happen in future?  Remember too, that high school/early college romances rarely make the distance.  It's the nature of people to change and be attracted to others.  Relatively few couples that young, grow together."

We were all just hanging out in their living room when she launched into a tirade. After which, she stood there brandishing her phone to show us each social media platform she was removing him from and posting on, while we sat there looking at each other and our friend's roommates going ""wtf.""

2) *He tried to push you past your boundaries (through pity) when you said no.* (Because you only wanted to have protected sex.) Seriously, that’s a vile move and you should not talk to this guy again. He doesn’t respect your safety or your decisions about your body.
(Also, “blue balls” is not actually a serious medical condition. Don’t ever fall for that. He can rub one out in the bathroom if it’s that bad.)

3) You were upset because you correctly saw he was trying to manipulate you into sex you didn’t want. Completely reasonable on your part.

Honestly, OP, it’s good to take a second look at your actions when you have a mental illness, but you acted completely normally this time. I’m sorry this guy was such a shithead! 

Literally, the only thing I would caution you against is minimizing in your head how he disrespected you and trying to sleep with him again. He’s a shitty sexual partner who doesn’t respect your boundaries. Delete his number.

EDIT: Wear a condom when you give head! Gonorrhea can lodge in your throat, and well as herpes and other infections. There’s no reason to take the condom off (or not put on a new one)."

We're in it for the long haul, but it's hard to plan for the future knowing that one of us is eventually going to have to give up being near family. That's not something I want to do to him, but also not something I necessarily want to volunteer for either. 

Believe me, I want with every fiber of my being to marry this man. But that's not feasible until we figure out what we're going to be doing and where we're going to be doing it. For the record, the deal is that whoever gets **The Big Gig** first determines where we put down roots. Then, we'll take that big kid job money to marry the heck outta each other."

This specific problem would be relatively easy to resolve, but do you really want a friend like that? I can't answer that for you, but what I can tell you is that you deserve a better friend than someone who belittles you and tells you that something is psychologically wrong with you for not wanting to watch some shitty cartoon.

And if he wants you to watch stuff he likes so badly, he should have watched the stuff you like too."
"I wait to see the response from the bride when she turns down her spot as a bridesmaid, before dumping the friendship altogether. 

For many people their wedding is the first time planning an event of this scale, let alone the many multiple ones that lead up to the actual wedding.

"You do realize this isn't really a comprise, right? You get what you want, a gun. He gets to be forced to use and train on something he isn't comfortable having in the first place.

"I think you might want to give your partner this small benefit of the doubt: Until faced with the reality, he may not have realized it *was* a dealbreaker.

It's fair of you to have asked the question. It's also fair that he just never really thought about it.

I understand being shocked and disappointed, but you need to recognize that he probably feels a bit shocked too and arguing over who has the right to be surprised here is utterly pointless. Deal with where you are at, and respect the fact that this idea seems to be new to him. He may need some time to digest it. 

You need to have a larger conversation with him, and you need to at least consider some of the other options (like storing the guns or the ammo at the range.) Our of respect to my partner's boundaries, I've agreed not to keep ammo in the house. It wasn't a tough agreement to come too, because like you, I don't see them as weapons for home defense. I don't need ammo in the house."
"I need to know more about how a 40 person guest list ran that wedding up to $80k. That is mind blowing. Did you all have a 10 course meal with imported bottles of wine flown in from France in first class seats? Was it held at an actual castle? Need details. :)  


The no Thank You card is classic in these scenarios. Just entitled people acting entitled. My cousin and his wife were this way, and they really hurt my sweet aunt in the process. She paid for a lot of wedding-related expenses AND gave them a $1000 cash gift. No verbal or written Thank You to her and they also ""forgot"" to include her in their wedding album that included all the other parents. She was heartbroken. And trust me, this isn't a woman/mom who is anything less than wonderful and kind. Weddings really have a way of showcasing selfishness."
Agreed. I have an incredibly well behaved dog who I take to my parents’ house while I’m at work. The few days she stayed home for the whole day she’s chewed something up. And that’s with a whole house to herself. Dogs are not cats. They don’t value being left alone like cats do. This is so unfair to the dog.
"Your wife has made a clear statement: her choice of employment is more important to her than you. Let that sink in for a bit, then decide for yourself what's appropriate under the circumstances.

If he doesn't want to have sex while his sister is in the building, ok. If he isn't comfortable with paying his sister to provide a service, that's kinda ok.

"The theme I'm seeing here is that he doesn't know what you expect from him in these situations until you start crying. How are you communicating with him before you get upset? He sounds like a guy who is trying to make compromises to please everyone around him and is failing at it. It also sounds like he comes through once he understands how important these things are to you. If you're telling him that they matter to you and he's ignoring that until you burst into tears, or do you expect him to just know already and get upset when he doesn't? Either way it's a communication problem."
"Owning a gun is not an effective means by which to protect yourself if you actually bother to look at the statistics. But yeah, I'm totally saying ""just lay there and die!"" What an absurd, emotional argument with no basis in reality. 

Look, if you want a gun for whatever reason I really don't care. You do you, buddy. But if you think having a gun in the house make you safer you're being ignorant to reality."
"For the phone, specifically: save as much as you can to the SIM card, transfer the SIM card to another phone, and wipe your old phone and don't bring it when you leave. 

You want to leave minimal avenues of control when you leave. He could use the phone being under his plan as a form of control.

Call the police (maybe non-emergency line) and tell them that you are leaving your toxic relationship bc your boyfriend is escalating to threats of violence and physical abuse. Ask for an officer to come to your apartment in case your boyfriend returns from work before you can get yourself fully out. If you have ANYONE within easy driving distance of you who could come and keep you company, call them. You'd be surprised how many people are willing to help even a near stranger when she's under threat from an abusive partner. Tell them that you're leaving your abusive boyfriend and don't want to risk being alone with him if he comes back. 

You need witnesses and authorities in your back pocket. Neighbors, former co-workers who don't actively hate you, someone from your gym or local gaming group or whatever who might pick up the phone. Police escort is your most effective option, but I can't guarantee that an officer will stay at your apartment all afternoon. (Even so, still call - you want documented proof of a history of abuse if he tries to hurt you.)

I am so, so sorry this is happening to you. You don't deserve any of it, at all. I'm sure you're going to have a lot of emotions to process when this is all over, but right now you have to keep your eye on the prize: freedom. Keep packing, and know that you have (approximately) 500-1000 complete and total strangers desperate to see you happy and safe. "
"Very good points, thank you!"
"&gt;If there's any conversation about weddings/marriage/having kids, she will say ""oh we're never going to get married"".........even though no one has actually asked us anything.

It sounds like she's just contributing to the conversation that's going on. No one may have asked, but that doesn't mean she isn't allowed to say anything...

To me it seems like you're making this into a bigger deal than it actually is. She's just reaffirming what you've known for the past six years."
Yeah I smelled that whiff of Cluster B as well.
"This is all her damage, not you. I doubt she hates you, I think she’s just so wrapped up in her new adventure that she’s not thinking about anyone but herself. You are doing the right thing by cutting contact, and for the first little while you should cut contact with ALL mutual friends as well. No updates, no secondhand information. It will only cause you to spiral. Focus on looking out for yourself. "
"Lol no one in the office ""turned her in"" for anything, he just made that up let's be real here. If anything her coworkers ate the pizza and were thankful."
"That sounds awful. I hope you're not making her feel too guilty about leaving just because you'll miss her (not saying you shouldn't miss her, but she clearly needs to leave!). On top of her being treated unfairly, she needs to leave to stand up for herself. It's really the only way. 

If she can prove they're being sexist and you can corroborate, she could look into suing for discrimination, but either way, her future at that company is dead, and that has nothing to do with you. 

I hope you can also get out soon!"
"Half a  year is a lot to ask. Yes there are phones and whatnot but it's not the same. How about you compromise and reduce the time? Validate her feelings but also ve flexible. Maybe shorten it to a few months instead of I want to leave you for SIX TO. EIGHT MONTHS. How. Would you feel if she told you she wanted to go off alone without you For Over half a year?

"
"What about this trip is religious if you say youre not religious?
If you committed to spending your life with someone, why would you want to abandon her for the better part of a year?
Why wouldnt you want her to join you so you could explore and grow together?
You sound like youre trying to take your midlife crisis to run away to asia away from your family. Thats not normal. This sounds really fishy and its not a very well thought out plan, youre never going to convince her because why would she want her husband to ditch her for 8 months? "
Right? How dare he be in his own house doing whatever he wants?
"I respect arranged marriages. I don't like them, wouldn't want to be in one, but I respect that other cultures have them and other people accept them.

For as long as these people consent and are happy with it, which these two are not."
"My husband has been going through a very bad bout of depression for several months. I just finished reading the book Codependent No More, and although it is about being in a relationship or family with someone with chemical dependence, you can apply most of it to mental illnesses as well.  It helped me very much and I think the changes I have made are helping my husband too. It will teach you that there is not much you can do to make it better, how to let her be responsible for herself, and how to make sure you're taking care of yourself too. Perhaps if you read it it will give you insight on if space is what you need or if there's a way for you to detach from her emotions for a bit so she can decide to handle them on her own when no one is propping her up anymore. I recommend therapy for you too if you're able. "
"I wouldn't be grossed out per se if it happened to me, but I'd be very offended.  I can't explain it, but I would find it extremely disrespectful if anyone else besides me had sex in my bed.  Guest bed, no problem, but *my* bed?  That's a slap in the face.   "
"If you don't want to do it via text or email (and I think email would be a fine way to lay out what you are thinking) then send her a text saying you need to have a private conversation just between the two of you about roommate issues.

He 100% needs to be chipping in financially if nothing else and may be violating the terms of your lease."
"""I must immediately begin emotionally manipulating my partner to ensure I get my way without even checking to see if we're on the same page"" is a horrifying trait for a person to have, no matter how important the discussion topic is."
"&gt;well I'm not fucking having it
&gt;he said he'd rather commit suicide than for me to have a child

That's not how an adult handles this kind of situation. Your boyfriend may be fairly young, but he's well past the age where he should be able to handle this with more maturity and tact. You landed yourself a dud, dear. But that's not a reflection on you -sometimes it takes something like this for people to show that they aren't, in fact, capable adults, but rather cranky teenagers in an adult's body. Some people can fake it so good they have everyone fooled. You deserve better, and I think you know that."
"Seriously, we need to know what happened to the $19 lasagne"
"It's pretty gross to think that she was potentially turned on by her own daughter watching her have sex, but you never know."
"That really sucks, but what do you want your wife to do? Your daughter is an adult. Yeah, it's creepy, especially if your friend has known her since she was young, but you can't force her to not date him. Blowing up will push her close to him. And if you cut her out of your life, she won't have anyone to turn to if the relationship goes south."
"Then you're an idiot for getting married to her in the first place. 

Your poor fucking wife."
"You're probably projecting. I read a lot of history and love to tell ""fun facts"" but I do my best to make sure they're actually fun. I don't tell the whole story of the First Crusade, I tell people about the ""Holy Cross"" or Peter the Hermit or the Siege Tower at Jerusalem -- usually something short and funny. It's far from being condescending."
"Ok. I don't think you ruined something great.

She didn't want to be with you. You decided to ""invest"" in her to get a result you wanted, and was persistent until it happened. People in these types of relationships didn't ""win"" the girl, they wore her down.

I don't know her, so I can't know her motivation for continually cheating, but I feel like not really wanting to be with you was very high up on that list. Then you were controlling, and later, abusive.

Get thee to therapy, friend. I think you've got a lot to unpack and examine with a professional."
This is good advice. No vet in the world would say this is okay. 
Your post says everything anyone needs to know about you.
"Nothing wrong with it at all. I grew up with a parent who required full-time care until their death when I was in my early 20s and because I know what that entails, I absolutely refuse to date anyone who whether due to physical or mental disability is anything less than fully autonomous. Being a caretaker is physically easy but mentally and emotionally exhausting and I've had enough of it for one lifetime. "
"Is his GF on trial in court? No. You get social pass for stuff like this, not court ordered. "
"It sounds like a completely normal way to let off steam. Unless he’s getting stupidly drunk all the time or driving home or his behaviour concerns you otherwise, it’s best you let him be. 

Try not to project your own aversion to drinking onto him is what I’m suggesting. "
Yes that's immature. He should go to the wedding.
"You don’t work, so are you in school? What do you do outside of this relationship? I hope you are not financially dependent on this guy. You should work towards getting a job, even if you are in school currently. You need to be doing something with your life that will allow you to be independent outside of this, or any, relationship. When you are dependent on someone, you are more willing to overlook the aspects of the relationship that make you unhappy, because, well, you have to in order to survive. 

You sound really sad. I know you’ve said several times you are fine with him being allowed to fuck other girls, but are you really? Are you allowed to go out and have sex with other people if you wanted to, or are you only allowed to have threesomes with his girlfriends? How did your “open” relationship start out? I’m not trying to be judgmental at all, I’m just trying to understand. I know every relationship is different, and open relationships can truly work for many couples, but this setup is a little different and i just don’t understand how you can be okay with him bragging about being with other women in front of you, especially when you’re not getting the intimacy and love you need. If he’s saying he’s too tired to kiss and have sex with you on a regular basis, but he’s got the energy to go out and be with other women, what does that say to you? 

"
"Keep every text and email. Start logging everything. Get proactive, you might even want to install a ring doorbell or a camera on your front door. Hopefully you won’t need those.

you need to go to the police. Also, let your employer know, if you have a good relationship with them, that you are being harassed by a person who is threatening to contact your place of employment. They may have protocols in place for such an event. ￼ "
Never ever ever call someone 20 times in a row. Ever. Ever.
"I say this with the utmost intended kindness, I promise I believe you about what you're observing, but do you think it's possible the roaches aren't real? Or even just not as serious as you think they are? I could imagine it being the case that even if it *is* as serious as you say, your fiance is concerned about taking your word for it and spending the money without seeing the problem, and that might be what's motivating him to try to put off handling this until he gets home - can you maybe send him photographs, or ask your mom to come visit and verify that the seriousness of the infestation indeed justifies an exterminator? 

Either way the other commenters are right that you shouldn't be paying for it, though, the landlord should. "
"Sure, but what is the wife supposed to do with insinuations? Even if she doesn’t miss the point entirely (there are plenty of non-sexual ways to be a nightmare boss), she confronts him, he denies it, then what? She not only has no evidence, she doesn’t even have allegations. "
"Hey, dude, you sound super super depressed. I’ve been there and it’s not always suicidal ideation and wanting to actively die...sometimes it’s just not wanting to be *alive*. You deserve to want to be here and feel excited about things again (because I’m assuming you’ve felt that way before). I would suggest a psychiatrist on top of therapy, to maybe get on antidepressants. Lexapro literally saved my life. I wake up now and actually want to be *alive* instead of just counting down the days until I could die of natural causes. It might help you too. Good luck"
Yeah I know that for sure. I just want some sort of explanation I suppose. I just can't get my head around how someone could do this
"You can want that all you want. He doesn't.

He doesn't want to kiss you, fuck you, actually love you. He wants to use you, and he is! And you keep defending him!

A year or two down the line I hope you reread this post. You'll feel so sorry for the poor soul who wrote it."
"On the offhand chance that this college Bf actually r*ped her or something in college, I understand the reaction (happens too often in college). 
But anything else, she is being silly. "
"I'm not going to say she's hysterical because I dislike the implications of term, but she's not being reasonable.  At all.  For starters, yes I acknowledge that her ex probably hurt her pride and feelings by publicly telling her off, but the bottom line is that:

1. They were teenagers at the time, and everyone knows and generally understands and accepts that teenagers aren't very good at relationships.

2.  **This all happened over 10 years ago.**

Unless OP is leaving something out like wife's ex was horribly abusive and going to the wedding would trigger some PTSD in her, then her still being upset over being dumped over a decade is ridiculous.  Part of adulting is being able to move on from your hardships.

But it doesn't stop there.  She's being very manipulative by saying that if OP goes to his sister's wedding that he's condoning cheating, which is both bullshit and a terrible thing to say to your spouse. 
 Then, saying that she ""can't promise she won't have a volatile reaction"" if he goes to the wedding without her is an even *worse* thing to say to your spouse and is a legitimate show stopper.  Those kind of subtle threats are a huge red flag and his wife absolutely need to apologize to him for making it.  It's never acceptable.

So unless OP is outright lying about his wife's reactions and the things she's said to him, she's got serious issues that she needs to address.  "
"Honey he’s asking you to fight *him* for him. You’re dating  piece of garbage who knows anyone his own age will see right through him. You are doing the right thing. Stay strong. You’re so young, and you have so much happiness in front of you now!"
"It would be incredibly unprofessional to bring your SO on a business trip, and it would reflect poorly on you. It's weird that he doesn't realise that.

It would be one thing if all your downtime on these trips was spent alone, but I'm assuming you socialise with your colleagues a good amount. Having your BF tag along would be very poor form."
Absolutely send the card! I found out my coworkers had regulars at my Cafe signing a card when I was out due to sickness in the family. It was heartwarming to return and know I was missed. 
"Chiming in that shoving all the pots away and then blaming it on someone else... sounds like my ADHD before I started getting treated and setting myself up with some better strategies.

I used to blame my roommate for all the stuff in my house being in weird places. Until she moved out and shit kept turning up in weird places. Oops I'm a huge jerk. And oftentimes its easier for one to blame others than to not only have the self awareness but to also accept are the source of their own problems.

I have nothing to add about how to deal with it though. It's hard to convince someone else that they need to check on their mental health."
"It sounds like Mom thinks the woman in the relationship is more likely to submit to the husband’s wishes when it comes to raising children. She’s betting on OP’s brothers being able to raise their kids Jewish without a fight because mumble-mumble-man-of-the-house, but thinks OP will have to take her husband’s wishes into account (hence its “easier” to marry someone who’s already on the same page). "
"Hey OP, I'm on the low-libido end of the spectrum too (thanks vaginismus!), and honestly your boyfriend sounds like kind of a nightmare in the sex department. Firstly:

&gt; Over the course of the day he'll jomingly do little sex-based annoyances like pinch my nipples or dive for my nana with dagger hands like he's trying to break balsa wood in karate class 

He needs to cut this out, full stop. He's basically unintentionally training you into associating him being horny with you being uncomfortable and/or in pain. (I know 'in pain' sounds bad and I know it's very mild pain, but honestly I think it will help you so much to both acknowledge that the things he do *hurt*, and to draw some hard boundaries around 'I'm not into pain, bro, not even a little'. It only takes a very little pain to kill the mood!)

I think some dudes think it's cute when women squeak and start when they suddenly attack us, but they don't realize that we're doing that because *ouch*, and not because we're merely surprised. The best gift you can give your boyfriend is a really solid clue-by-four that these things he's doing hurt and they make you anxious rather than horny, because his obliviousness means you basically can't trust him not to hurt you. He indicates he wants to get all sexy with you, and you're busy making the calculation of 'Hmm, is this going to *actually* be a good time, or is his obliviousness and enthusiasm going to blind him to what I'm experiencing? Will he notice if I stop having a good time?' You basically can't trust him with your body.

&gt; And after two years I'm still doing a lot of sex training 

*Two years*. I don't know that there is much hope for him changing at this point, and I totally understand if you're just tired of all this being so much *work*. Maybe he can still be trained with the right words and you're just too tired to care, and that's ok."

"&gt; They’ve already said it’s okay because he got an annulment

How convenient."
Stop trying to justify it and instead learn from it. Take some time to be single and figure out what you actually like and want from your life. When you do date again realize you can't make someone else happy if they aren't happy anywhere and that the level of codependency you described is concerning.  Someone who is really a good partner wouldn't just uproot you suddenly without concern for how it impacts you.  Someone who is a good partner to you will prioritize their financial independence enough that you would have never been in that position (hint: she wanted you to stay in Austin not because she wanted you near her but because she wanted to leave that apartment/ all the bills to you without it costing her anything). The fact that the only reason you were in Austin was for her should have told you that you should have never been in Austin in the first place. 
"Replying here so you'll see it.

Consider walking into your local police station and talking with an officer about false emergencies your parents might call in. If you go with printouts of texts and emails of the things your parents have said about why they felt the need to call the police (i.e. totally not an emergency), and any threats to call the police if you don't respond the way they think you should, the police can keep that information on file when considering whether to check up on you at your parents' demand.  They still might be obligated by law to check on you, but it will be less of a OMG ARE YOU OK CALL YOUR PARENTS and more of a ""Yeah we got another call, ok good night."" 

What you do NOT want is your parents using the police to track you by filing a missing persons report on you because you didn't call in at the right time. This is not outside the realm of possibilities. Your mother may feel the need to escalate her behavior to prove how serious she thinks this is to control you more.  "
"That's a really good point, and I'm glad to hear that at least part of what I'm doing is normal! Thanks for pointing that out.

If I had to pin down why I need to be better when comparing myself, it's probably because any compliments or positive feedback I received was only given because I was achieving, especially when achieving more than other people. "
"You're assuming that she can get it from wherever she keeps it, point it at him, and pull the trigger faster than he can grab her wrist. I'm not sure OP wants to take that gamble."
Stop stringing this poor girl along. You've wanted to break up with her for years?! Just do it! She deserves to be with someone who actually wants to be with her.

"When they ask where you’re going? “Doing some running around.” Casual, vague. You don’t owe details and you’re going to be super busy and in a rush to leave every time. 

They have the audacity to ask why you don’t spend a lot of time at home? “That’s a strange question to ask. I live here, I don’t spend every day here. Bye!” 

Say it all with a smile but be firm in your tone. "
"Your girlfriend is a shitty person. I know that's hard to acknowledge because I'm sure she's fine most of the time. But objectively, she is shallow, ignorant, spoilt and stupid. Make of that what you will."
"This post makes it sounds like the OP was being completely insane but somehow there’s one of those “If you can’t accept me at my worst you don’t deserve me at my best” comments. I do agree with one thing though, she probably should have let the BF leave. He’s not going to be happy for long and it wastes everyone’s time. "
"Look, polygamy/nonmonogamy doesn't really have anything to do with the impulse to cheat.  The impulse to cheat largely has to do with the thrill of doing something you're not supposed to be doing, and the thrill of being caught.  He lets you go through his phone to rebuild trust but was stupid enough to leave that picture there, why?  Because it's thrilling.  Because every time you touch his phone there's that adrenaline rush that he might get away with it, or might get caught.  And since you always forgive, there's no consequence if he does.

Becoming open doesn't really have the same thrill, unless he breaks some of your rules like no sex with other people in your bed.  It might be new enough to entertain him for a little while, but he'll be looking for that rush again, because cheating has nothing to do with being poly."
"Is he aware that you believe you can not afford to leave him? If so, he will not change. He is selfish and unkind. 

Start doing research. I assure you there’s a way to leave this man and ensure you can survive. Right now I wouldn’t plan to leave; I would plan to research how to leave, and then have a clear, direct discussion: If he does not act as an equal partner, you cannot stay. Give it a timeline. If you are still in the same place without any effort from him 6months to a year from now, you will have to talk to a lawyer. 

You’re not the only one suffering. If he’s gaming he’s not raising his kids. He’s kinda watching them, but not raising them. And your children will feel his disinterest. I mean, does he make their lunches? Are they quality lunches? Why aren’t chores being done? Because if no chores are being done, it’s an indicator that nothing else is either, like trips to the library or park, or present, valuable 1:1 time with the kids. Kids know when their parent is disinterested. And the consequences are severe. I truly hope you didn’t deal with any language delays which are common with disinterested, distracted parenting. 

It’s not sustainable. Tell him so. It can’t go on. You’re exhausted. You’re clearly not putting in equal effort.  So. 

Make a chore chart, there are so many on Pinterest. They have each day of the week with common daily chores. Print them out. Go over them together. He will need to take the majority of tasks, you can take a few. Make it clear you expect these tasks to be complete; you have done your work for the day and he will need to show he’s done his. Ensure things like trips to the park or library are included, because parenting is his job. Not babysitting. Parenting. "
"Lol, my visceral reaction to seeing that line ""we still love you"" is ""that's nice but my feelings have now changed substantially towards you."" I always find it entertaining that the other person's feelings/reaction is supposed to be swept under the rug because your (general you) feelings are unchanged. It's a shortsighted perspective, imo.

I usually operate under a policy of ""if I wouldn't want my SO knowing about it, I won't do it"" though. "
"So you know how you have a tendency to assume the worst? You're doing it right now. ""I'll NEVER be stable enough for a relationship!!!"" is catastrophic thinking. In reality, you have DECADES to work on this and even just a few years is enough to completely change your situation.

What you need is therapy. You might have to shop around for a therapist you click with, but if you do that and you commit to recovery, you WILL get better."

"Look for another place to rent. Your family is going to refuse to cooperate for the owner’s interview, so this place is not going to work out.  It isn’t fair, but it looks like that’s the situation you are in. 

Don’t tell your family about it until you have already made the arrangements and are completely ready to move out.  Make sure that you get your important documents and valuables out of your parents’ house before your parents freak out. Also make sure that your parents will not be able to mess with your bank account when they freak out.  

This is going to be ugly, so you need to come at it strategically.  "
"You mean you have to split assets that both people contributed towards during the marriage? The horror!

If anything the risks are decreasing. More couples are both working which reduces the chances of alimony at all and when it does happen it's less money for a shorter time that it used to be. Any belief that it's more risky now than it was 25 or 50 years ago is simply dead wrong. Much like the irrational fears of people that think the crime rate is high, you're just wrong."
Ugh yes exactly!!!! You literally summed it up perfectly.
I have a feeling he’d be just as unhappy if they DID treat OP like a “beautiful and feminine” woman. Possibly unhappier. 
"No, hon, you're not wrong to do what you feel is the right thing for your peace of mind after such a shock. I'm really sorry your cat died, and so unnecessarily too. 

You're not responsible for you mother's mental health or social isolation, *she is.* She's the parent, you are not required to parent her. 

I really think you should try to find a professional to talk to about this. Seeing a therapist, even in the short term, to work through your justifiable feelings of grief and rage would be really helpful. "
"You don't need to be so afraid of labels. They help as much as they hurt.

For example, I am African. Both of my parents are immigrants to America. I look vastly different from most people I know. I need different hair and skin care techniques and products than white people. To ignore those differences is just dishonest and unhelpful. 

Considering myself African has done more good than harm to me. Are you saying that the differences between Africans and other groups hasn't been scientifically proven? Are you saying I shouldn't call myself African because ""that is being racist""? That is dumb, I'm sorry.

And to answer your first line, race is a gradient, not a box. A Turkish person could be considered Eurasian, white, eastern European, west Asian; who cares. What matters is that the description has been colloquially determined to match their genetics. "
How is it salty to realise your ex stole something from you and then had it on display in their house that they kept on show whilst you were there!? 
"This is heavy. You may need a therapist to sort through this with you: somebody smart and capable of looking at sexuality and masculinity. It's obvious you somehow feel your sexual prowess is connected to your self esteem as a husband and a partner and that's not really healthy. Sex is good and important even but just by being a good partner and husband you are doing plenty. Marriage is not just a romantic relationship, its a lot of work that needs to be shouldered by two people. "
"Sadly, yes.  MILs can lose their damn mind, especially if their entire lives were devoted to taking care of the kid, which she is still doing. She has zero interests, no other passions, no nothing aside from homemaking/kid rearing and that job has come to an end.  Just look how she infantilizes her TWENTY-FIVE year old son.  Fuck.  They can behave up to the wedding, but usually little things come out during planning. But her coldness during the wedding and everything else you described? No speech? Inviting herself to a girl's event (you can easily tell her, ""Sorry if there was a misunderstanding, this is just a trip for my friends and me"") and the other crap she pulled indicates clearly that your husband will have to get out of this fog of denial.  It'll take him some time, as he has normalized her behavior, and he's the first to get married, and you bet she's on her best behavior when he's around, plus she sounds very sneaky. 

Congrats on your wedding! Hold strong, don't be afraid to lay down a ""no"" with her, don't let her fuck with your dog and don't be afraid to stand up for your new role as no. one woman in your husband's life."

"You didn't seem to mention what your girlfriend thinks about what is happening?  How does she feel about how her mother treats you?  Does she stand up for you when her mother is misbehaving over the years?    


As for surviving the rest of the week, I'd kill her with kindness.  Stay out of her way if you can - but if you are around her, just be as pleasant as possible.  That way, if she is rude and unpleasant, it just makes her look worse.  Thankfully, it seems like everyone else present (except probably the brother who will hopefully relax eventually) has no issue with you and likes you.  Sadly, it does seems like Mom is racist, and if that is the case, there is probably nothing you can to do during this week to change that.  If it's already been 6 years and she hasn't mellowed, the next week isn't going to change her views.  Since you plan to spend your life with this woman, hopefully mom will change her way of thinking, especially if you plan to have children.   Good luck!"

"It's like you managed to squeeze a red flag into almost every sentence of your post. If your goal is to be in an abusive relationship with someone who will never respect you, definitely get married. But this isn't going to get better and there's no trophy for committing your life to someone who treats you like shit, so don't expect anything good to come of this relationship."
"If you decide to do this, don't be surprised if when you get back, you find out your wife has moved on with her life and you are no longer a part of her future plans. 

Because the entire 8 months you are off finding yourself and exploring the world...she will be spending wondering if you are the man she actually wants to spend the rest of her life with.  And every person she knows will be telling her that she can do better, that you abandoned her, that you are off sticking your dick in every random woman you can find. 

It doesn't matter that you are going on a spiritual journey...everyone you know will see this for what they think it is.  A man's midlife crisis and his desire to sleep with a bunch of women his wife won't know about.

Doesn't matter if it's true or not.  For 8 months that is all anyone will fill her mind with.  That you are not being faithful.

So take this trip at your own peril....and accept that if you do go on it, your marriage may not survive.

EDIT:  I also wonder if you are going to afford your wife the same opportunity to travel the world for a year without you.  Seems only fair that when you get back, she should be able to travel anywhere she wants to go.  "
"I think that BrokenPaw has a great point. I don't know if you are in the United States, but if you are there are so many different communities of faith very close here.  For example, I am from a part of rural Louisiana in Cajun country where there are ""witch doctors""/spiritual healers called traiteuses.  My mother was cured of measles by a traiteuse who prayed a French prayer with her and fed her a tea made with sticks.  The belief is that if you tell them ""thank you"" or try to pay them, the healing will not work.  You can find small communities like this all around the United States, and if you go to big, diverse cities like New York or Houston, there are pockets of every culture and creed you can imagine.  

Perhaps before taking a trip around the world to experience the people and culture, you could take a local trip as an introduction so that you would appreciate it more if you ever do take a trip around the world.  There is so much in this world to learn about and understand, and perhaps if you started your journey more locally you can begin finding the answers you are seeking sooner.  I understand that you've done quite a bit of reading, but if you could meet some of the people, taste their food, experience their culture, maybe it will answer some of your questions and create even new ones.  "
"&gt;Without people telling me this is a terrible idea can my parents call the police and report me missing if i’m 18 and they know where i am i just decided to go without their permission?

They can report you missing, but you're 18, so all the police will do is find out if you're safe and that's it.

However, it is a terrible idea to sneak out of the house and text them right before you get on your plane and say that you're ""old enough."" Are you prepared to be homeless upon your return from Greece? Or deal with other consequences if they continue to let you live in their home (taking away anything they pay/paid for, like phone, laptop, etc)?"
"There's lessons your husband needs to learn that you can't teach him. My son (who's now 18) would overcrowd people a lot when he was at school. Even though he's always been an incredible person he would just make his friends at school feel suffocated with his presence. I told him he needs to start doing his own thing or else he'd keeping pushing people away. After one day of doing his own thing he was asked to go to a sleepover by one of his mates who was avoiding him. Nowadays people are clingy on him instead of the other way round. 

But I dont think you should be the one to teach him this. If I was in his shoes I'd feel horrible being told by my wife that I was too clingy on her. Maybe a male friend or my Mum or Dad. Even learn simple rules of attraction. Plenty of stuff online. Clinginess kills all forms of relationships. 

I just don't have that problem though. If anything my ex's would say that I'm not invested enough in the relationship. "
"No, don't stay with someone for months just because they have nowhere to go. There'll always be some crisis that could give you reason to stick around. He can rent a room, he can crash on a friend's couch for a couple months, he can solve his problems in any number of ways that don't involve staying with you."
"This sounds like an absolute nightmare. Can you really tolerate this for the rest of your life? You're young, the rest of your lives could be a very long time.

&gt; He has this puppy dog look in his eyes 24/7 like he's just waiting on me to pay attention to him. 

I've been there, and it absolutely killed my attraction to that person.

&gt; I don't want to change in front of him any more because he stares at me with this creepy look on his face.

Once one partner starts describing the other as ""creepy,"" the relationship is pretty much over. It's really hard to come back from that mindset (and again, I'm not blaming you.) He needs therapy to deal with his dependency issues, and he sounds completely unwilling to pursue that, so you don't have any options left.

&gt; He totally played the victim card and was all ""I'm sorry I want to spend time with my wife."" ""I'm sorry I love you.""

I don't blame you for being angry over how this went down. What childish, manipulative bullshit. Personally, I'd tell him that it's not a choice. He either agrees to therapy, and the relationship is done."
"&gt; All his friends, and his family, agree with my interpretation that he is deep in denial that his childhood best friend grew up to see him romantically

Have they told him this? I can understand that some people are so innocently naïve that they don't notice when people flirt with them, but it's no longer an excuse if multiple close people in your life have told you the truth. If his girlfriend, friends, and family are all telling him the same thing, and he ignores it, then I don't know what to tell you. He simply cares more about her feelings than yours"
"I’ve found my people in this comment thread. 

When I first read this I was like “I know what I would do!”  I was curious to see if anyone would agree.  Glad to know I’m not alone!"
"&gt; I guess what’s most upsetting is the lack of thought and communication maybe?

Some people really don't make a big deal of birthdays. I'm one, and they aren't a big deal to me - mine, or anyone else's. Expecting him to cross-check any events around that time with your birthday celebrations are a bit much, especially when the stag do was organised first."
"&gt;I guess I will unblock her from stuff and ask mutual friends to say I am down if she wants to talk or maybe play some video games like we used to.

Don't bother. Seriously. Don't. 

&gt;I no longer am as shallow.

You *kiiinnnddda* are :/"
I tried the generous part a few times actually. The main reason I still bother being friends is with her is so she doesn't drag even more crap into my cousins home.
"To me it sounds like she was using settle in the sense of settling down (which to me is a positive thing), not settling in the sense of accepting less from a partner than she really wants.

I definitely settled down when I got into a relationship with my partner - traded in late-night barhopping for going to bed at 11 after watching netflix or cooking dinner together.  It's awesome and I wouldn't trade it for anything but I'd definitely say I settled down and gave up my previous lifestyle when we started dating."
"I suspect that (because of the prevailing leanings of the Reddit community as a whole) you are not going to find a lot of support here for the idea of keeping a gun in the house.  And I say that as someone who has one less than five feet from me right now.

The thing is that the subject of guns is one that many people have a *very* difficult time being rational about.  There's a *lot* of misinformation out there, and a lot of pretty vicious rhetoric on both sides of the debate.

Ultimately, however, this is an issue in your life about which there can be no middle-ground compromise: either there *is* a gun in the home, or there is not.  There's no way to go halfsies on this with him.

You have to decide which is more important to you:  having a gun for your own defense, or living with him.  Because I'd be willing to bet you a shiny new nickel that there's exactly zero chance he'll bend on this.  

Personally, I would choose not to be with someone who did not accept my choices about how I would defend my own safety.

He's perfectly within his rights to refuse to have a gun in his home.  You're perfectly within *yours* to choose whether that's a home you would feel safe living in, especially given how often you will be alone there.
"
"She's planning on, or has already set up a hookup at the music festival. Sorry dude. She said that so that she can turn it around if you catch her at it. "
I don't believe her assualt stopped at a kiss.
"Uh, yeah this isn't normal! And she punched you in the head after saying you weren't going to come between him and her? You're crazy for dealing with this bullshit. 

Please dump this idiot. There's obviously something going on there."
I'd tell her to not lecture you on your sexuality.  She seems like she'd claim to be a feminist and she needs to understand that a big part of it is accepting other women's sexual choices and not infantilizing them. 
I think OP meant between him and the other dude
"&gt;he has also been unfaithful numerous times in the first 18 months of our relationship.

And you knew this, and you stayed with him? OP, what the fuck. WHY did you repeatedly take someone back that cheated on you?

You should lose his number because he's a hypocrite, a liar, a cheater, and most likely a huge misogynist. 

"
"If I was your girlfriend and I couldn't come around your house anymore because you let your homophobic dad move in with you, I would be mighty upset.

I would also seriously worry about a long term future with someone who let their dad control them to that degree, especially if we were gay and the dad wouldn't approve of a gay relationship or marriage. That would signal to me that I would always be coming second."
"You've been together for six months. If you've got issues already worth posting to reddit about with her omitting important truths, having issues with sex, and now going off to Europe solo... Is this really someone you want to be with for longer than six months? "
"""I had sex in Europe once. Ur bird gonna shag every fucker in the hostel"" honestly this is what you sound like. 

Please never come back. "
He values his honesty over her comfort.
"I have this strange feeling that if your gf decides to speak to your brother after being turned down that any constructive criticism that he gives her is going to be taken as an insult. 

I'd be very careful with this. Honestly, she should seek therapy. Have a professional guide her through her issues, many people like this don't realize the error of their ways just because someone who cares about them tells them. They find ways to make themselves the victim. There is a very real possibility where if you dare mention these problems are caused by her that she'll rewrite the story into you degrading her or something.

Not saying this is the case, just my opinion."
"&gt; Why would you want to be with someone who gets over the top disgusted by seeing 2 men together on tv, but admits if it was 2 women he'd be into it?

He even admitted he'd be more okay with watching scenes of women being abused, than he is with watching scenes of men together. Ugh."
"Unless you're ready to quit smoking all she's doing is adding unnecessary stress. Maybe you need to put your foot down here and say as much? ""I just don't feel like quitting smoking right. Stop asking."" Could she be trying to find a way to end the realtionship by blaming the cigarettes? 

&gt; I would like to be able to sit down in the living room and smoke a cigarette instead of using elevator to go 6 floors down every time I'm urged to smoke or get stressed. 

Eeeeh. Now, there... I agree with her. Unless you own your own home, I don't think smokers belong smoking in places they rent and share walls with non-smokers. The smell seeps and gets everywhere. It's gross as fuck. If she's not a smoker and smelling you, I can see why she's frustrated and agree it's not right to try to change you now. Smokers tend not to comprehend how bad they smell, and how bad their habit makes a pretty huge radius around them smell when they smoke indoors. "
"Yes, they are. It's up to the owner to decide what kind of access they are OK allowing. You can absolutely tell your neighbors to not let their dog or children in their yard. It's not a free-for-all just because it's outside. And yes, it would also depend on the local culture. OP is clearly not in that cultural mindset and it doesn't seem like this is something normal for the neighborhood, considering she had neighbors tip her off about Steve being in her yard.

The difference is, do you lift your dog over a fence to let them poop in a neighbor's yard?

Do those children climb fences to play in their neighbors yard?

I think you guys are missing the fact that OP had a locked, fenced in area that the neighbor had to climb over in order to grab the cherries. That is a clear violation of her privacy and personal property."
"Here’s what my friends did for me: turned up on my doorstep with food, alcohol and films so we had a night in having a laugh, went on nights out with me, did random stuff with me during the day that we wouldn’t usually do like go to museums and stuff, listened to me and generally acted as distractions as I healed.

You are a good friend OP! "
It sounds like you’re right. Maybe I just wanted to believe that our relationship was at least a little more meaningful than “not giving a single fuck about me”. 
"I think you are caught up in fantasy that you've built up around her. While the age difference isn't a deal breaker, I don't think it's a good idea to date her while she is still in school. "
"One thing is I think it’s how he was raised. Not giving him an excuse his dynamic was just different, he wants to agree with him that it sucks, which I have tried and he still continues. I absorb others emotions so easy it’s ridiculous, I have gotten better and this over time but still need work. Honestly I have told him to just go talk to his mom before because somehow it works for him. 

I don’t get it. "
"To me, the biggest problem isn't even that he lied about a mistake in his past that he is clearly ashamed of, it's that he dismissed his girlfriend's feelings of being bullied and harassed by Sally. That's cause for break-up right there, when your boyfriend won't even pick you over someone who is being nasty (likely because of jealousy). The whole situation sounds toxic as fuck."
Reading enough on here - “we worked through it” is code for “I let it go.”  
Dumb reason to get stuck on. So he's either not telling you the real reason OR you would be better off without him if that is his real reason.
"My fiancé does this thing where he keeps an eye out for good doggos and always points them out to me. He considers this very important because of how much I love a good doggo, and he is aware of my doggo ranking system (the bigger and fluffier, the better, but bonus for pugs or corgis). Our co-ed softball team only realized we were dating when he paused while walking to go up to bat to yell ""SWEETIE, CORGO PUPPY"" and point excitedly at the opposing team's bleachers. It may sound dorky, but there is something so incredibly special about a man who is always trying in such a little, silly way to make me just a little bit happier."
That was the first sexist thing? Not the bride filled his head with things he's never thought before that he started with?
"Some people are just 'takers'.

If you continually give to people, then at some stage you will run out of resources/energy to your own detriment.  There's a reason why on planes they say put on your own oxygen mask first - it's no good if you help someone else out and die yourself!  You need to keep yourself alive too!"
I'm glad someone else noticed this it sounds a lot like an obsession with not spending money rather than just being frugal.

"I'm surprised no one asked this but: are you sure the post in question isn't just ""fan fic"" on his part? Like erotic fiction he wrote for fun a few years ago? The way you describe the details makes me feel like it's at least a possibility. 

I'd at least sit him down and tell him ""look, I snooped a little and I feel bad. But we need to talk about this post..."" and show him the post. "
Oh that is seriously well done.
"&gt;I don't trust them at all. I don't think I'm ever going to be at peace with the idea of them being there, even if they promise to respect my wish.


I know everyone has different levels of how confrontational they're willing to be, but I honestly think you should be honest with him.


""Friend, I've been thinking about it and based on how you acted with your GF at the river party, I don't know if I can trust you to follow the house rules at my cabin. This is something I take really seriously, and I'm sorry but having you up for this visit isn't going to work out.""


Yes, this will upset your friend and cause some conflict. But I also really believe it is the most respectful way to do it; he is an adult, and he deserves to have honesty about why he's no longer invited."
"My MIL is one of those people who can't keep anything to herself, no matter how personal the detail. Nothing is off-limits as far as she is concerned, and she will happily blab about it to anyone who will listen. She also exaggerates and gets details confused, so even telling her something minor runs the risk of her blowing it way out of proportion. 

As a result, my husband tells her nothing. He hardly ever talks to her. She's been completely kept in the dark about anything involving his/our personal life. She gets upset that he hardly talks to her, but it's her own damned fault. If she'd show a little bit of self-control and respect for the personal lives of her family, he'd probably be more likely to talk to her. "
"I don't think your were asking for too much considering the fact he used his workplace to cheat on you so a rational solution would be to either get another job or to transfer branches/departments/ SOMETHING to get away from his coworker because the trust isn't there at all. And if he values a JOB over YOU/the marriage that's pitiful, it's automatically a wrap. Trust me if he's qualified, there are plenty of jobs for him to go to if he really loved you and wants this marriage to work. You weren't asking him to quit right away but the fact he didn't even consider it an option shows he doesn't care about how you feel about his current workplace situation and I personally think he likes his ""good job"" because he was getting some good work from that 40 year old lady SMH."
"They don’t owe you forgiveness. It’ll likely always be this way.

(Not saying you totally expect forgiveness)"
"&gt; You’re angry at how I worded my post. I’m sorry if it struck you negatively

No I'm not angry. Although I can see how if I was your wife or anyone close to you, I'd be furious. 

&gt;  paint a clear picture of us both.

Oh that you did. It's obvious what you're up to to, even if you think you're being really clever. "
"You should leave. You became an adult 18 years ago. If you haven't seen enough things and gone enough places, you are not ready now and may never be. Let her move on and have kids and the life she is hoping for."
"If you were here for the ass-kicking, you wouldn't be getting so defensive to feedback. Both of you need help."
"My wife can drink me under the table. She doesn’t drink often, but when she does she’s seemingly immune to alcohol. She can drink all night, have a blast, and doesn’t get a hang over.

She did keto, and it changes dramatically.

She found out the day she had HALF of a margarita, and ended up half unconscious vomiting in the restaurant bathroom.

"
"Whoa I didn’t even catch that. Yeah, I really am questioning OPs judgement though, it doesn’t seem like she is capable of handling her children’s safety and well being in an emergency.

I also caught in her post history that she calls her husband every day when she drops off the baby at daycare to confirm that she didn’t leave them in the car on accident, which seems a little off."
"It could be that he just doesn’t know what else you want him to do or say? Maybe try telling him what you want from him? 

I know I had to with my Ex, he wouldn’t have a clue if I hadn’t told him explicitly what I wanted him to do. 

The other thing is this could be the way he deals with stuff and isn’t one for talking through everything etc. "
"That is...so, SO far from a joking matter."
"I discussed this with someone else lower down but I don't think you should pay 1/3 if you can't afford it. But I do think you should help where you can - even if it's ""I can only really afford 100 bucks a month"". Because that's what your parents did - they helped when they couldn't really afford it. I don't think you should go as far as going into debt for his college, and he should still be encouraged to work at a job to cover what your family can't, but it really seems like you had a soft agreement with your parents of ""we can lean on you and you'll try to help"" and then once it's inconvenient at all you're backing out.

Everyone is right that it is your money and you have no legal obligation. But I think you're going to lose the support of a generally loving family at the expense of ""well *legally*...."" and I don't think it's worth it."

"Thank you. That sounds like a good idea.   
Unfortunately, the mechanic was right: the fluid line was (almost) broken, too, which would have led to a complete loss of braking power. "
If he did this somewhat maliciously then surely you should feel unsafe? He tried to hurt you if so and odds are if he's tried once he could try again (not saying he was doing it maliciously but there's a possibility)
Not if you were poor. Or broke. Poor women have always worked.

"This. We all loved my friend’s husband - they’d been happily together for ten years when they got married. Two years in he picks up a cocaine habit and pretty suddenly all their joint savings are gone. Thank god she had a separate account with a pre-marriage nest egg so she could rent a studio when he started regularly getting high and punching holes in walls.

OP, your wife is wise. "
"Yes! He *totally* buried the lede. A character flaw of this magnitude means that it will affect every single aspect of OP's life with this girl. There was a post on here, not too long ago, from a husband who was married to a woman with this exact problem. She was essentially unemployable, entirely self-unaware, refused to listen to *any* criticism and it was completely tanking their marriage.


OP is asking for a Band-Aid for a massive bleeding wound. This is just the start of a recurring destructive event in his relationship and it will eventually wear him down unless she has an epiphany and seeks out therapy and career training, focusing on work ethic and people skills.


But, it's been my experience in life that if someone reaches adulthood and enters the workforce without developing a strong work ethic and quickly shedding their entitlement and better-than attitude, they just find someone who will indulge and support them while all the while whining ""it's just not fair!"". If I were OP, I would be taking this time to deeply consider the facts and make a decision about living an entire life having to take care of someone like this. His girlfriend has told him exactly who she is - he needs to believe it."
"This is way too much drama.

1. Stay broken up with Olivia. She deserves someone who isn't pulled in so many directions.

2. Live on your own. Its past time to break up the codependency between you Lilly and your brother. It's time to get some space, it will do wonders for your headspace. That doesn't mean you can't regularly hang out or do dinners, go to events, etc. However this dynamic is not healthy for you or Lilly. Learn to live with yourself."
"Here's the thing. I don't really believe you want to be better. If you felt bad, if you wanted to do better ... You would have. You weren't blindsided here. This has been going on for years. You knew what was at stake, you knew she had one foot out the door ... And yet you did nothing to change. Her leaving you, what, twice before? That didn't scare you into changing. If you cared, if you were truly sorry, you would have taken action. You didn't. There's no reason on earth to believe you'll do anything different this time. Because you've had ample chances to work on this and nothing has changed. If someone keeps saying they're sorry but keeps hurting you over and over the same way -- that's how you know they aren't really sorry. If they were sorry, they'd stop.

From my perspective and your wife's, this is just more empty words, more empty promises.  Have you done anything besides talk? Anything constructive? Have you talked to a therapist? Have you made any actual changes? 

Honestly, it might just be time to let this end. Work on yourself, change for yourself so this doesn't happen with your next relationship. All the evidence points to the fact that you don't really want this to work. If you did, you'd have actually done something about it."
"This happens to me all the time. My husband always pays for everything but he frequently will be all “Im going to take you out Friday” then it’s Thursday and I ask if he’s made any plans or reservations anywhere and he hasn’t like wtf?!!

Now it’s just easier for me to do all the date planning because if I don’t make plans then he will choose some last minute restaurant and the only place left with a table on a busy Friday night aka somewhere whack af or the restaurant he wants to take me to is closed since he didn’t do any research until the day of. "
"Sit him down for a talk, and ask him about it. There's not much more we can do to help. If he lies or evades, you know something odd is up. 

Talk to him first, then talk to us."
"&gt; You do when you have more than 18k in savings.

18K is not that much in savings for people in their mid 30s tbh.  That money can vanish in an instant because of an unexpected major expense (god forbid a serious illness, someone losing their job, etc).

Plus she said that they are on the hook for $7K to the IRS, paying tuition for a kid, and have student loans and car payments to make.

It's really really not as much as you think."
"&gt; NO IDEA if it's even possible for him to tighten the handbrake without noticing the state the rear brakes were in. Please tell me if I'm way off lol

Tightening the handbrake is exactly what it sounds like. You take the center console cover off, tug the cable connecting the handbrake to the actual brake and remove slack. You do it as a stopgap because that slack isn't ""just there,"" it exists because there is significantly less braking material in the drum (the shoe is the part that wears down and does the braking). You're literally compensating for the part of the friction material that's already worn away, and when you replace the rear shoes you need to adjust it back because now your hand brake will be too tight.

But, adjusting it is a real thing and you do it for shoes at like 60% of their life or shoes where you'd rather have some useful ability out of your handbrake versus nothing because your shoes are so far gone they're not making contact with the drum anymore. Ben SHOULD HAVE adjusted the handbrake and said ""okay, you can go home on these rear brakes, but that I had to make this adjustment means you REALLY REALLY need new shoes. Get them next paycheck"""
"Four years. with no foreplay. girl, why? why are you still with him?"
"It is a gift to the family, not just us, but in the past our whole family has definitely deferred to my wife's wishes when planning holidays since my brother's family is so chill and I'm not particularly opposed to any one destination. 

So yeah I think my wife has forgotten this fact and assumed the trip is just for HER when it's really not. Besides the cruise is already a compromise since my brother/SIL would genuinely prefer an on-land destination but agreed to a Europe cruise as long as it's slightly shorter. So my parents think it's already a good compromise that gives a bit to everyone but obviously isn't everyone's ideal."
