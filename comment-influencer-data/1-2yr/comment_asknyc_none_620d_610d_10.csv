"You stole shit, why wouldn't it be legitimate? What the hell is wrong with you? He doesn't need your consent to film you stealing his newspaper, it's funny that you're worried about consent now after what you've been doing for 9 fucking months and that you don't feel like the law applies to you. 

Enjoy court!"
"It doesn't matter, you took something that isn't yours. You do not have the authority to do that. A rational person would have talked to the man at some point over the past 9 months instead of just stealing it all. But...well...here we are.

You stole them. You are in the wrong. End of story. You deserve to be taken to court, you admit to stealing them. I really don't see why you're surprised that this could happen."
"&gt;AGAINST MY WILL AND WITH NO CONSENT FROM ME

You mean like how you took his newspapers? He pays for the WSJ, you taking his delivered goods he paid for is theft just as much as if it was an amazon package.

You sound detached from reality and I'm glad you're getting this reality check. Have fun in court."
"&gt;not sure, dont follow the news much

If only there was some sort of printed news that you could steal from your neighbor to find out what's going on...and wait...does this mean that you steal the papers and you also don't read them?"
"great thread, always worth waking up to new stuff. 

10/10, would read again"
"No, there is no context that makes what you did right.

Again, enjoy court, mr. successful art business guy who can't afford to buy his own newspaper. No one cares about your work so stop bringing it up"
This guy sounds like Trump
"Just the way you are talking 

Imagine him saying this:

&gt;im [in the white house] and very busy, phone cosntantly off the hook because of certain things, good things, that happened yesterday. major announcement and a lot of buzz here.

Plausible?"
"It literally makes no difference even if it was a gift, and having a summons isn't for civil court cases. How are you real?"
"Just so everyone is aware of Reddit User u/11214goy - straight harassing my inbox acting like a child.

"Yes, you can order. If a place is open, they’re open. But! You gotta expect delivery to take longer than estimated and you gotta be generous with the delivery tips. "
"Why are we feeding ande guilding trolls

Edit: I'm actually impressed he's had this username for five years and this is his only post and comments"
Whether he reads them or not doesn't change the fact that you stole them from him.
It's an extra treat for the snow day.

"Yes, he can take you to small claims court and demand you pay him back the value of what you stole. "
"This is a great idea, if you want to give him even more evidence if/when he decides to sue you. Plz update this post when he does that."

"That's an incredibly sweet gesture, but a combo of security issues, distance (there isn't anything for miles around JFK), and the fact that there's already a ton of really great food places in JFK, it might not be the wisest choice. Depending on the terminal, you could find a nice place for them to eat, call the place, and send over a couple of cocktails or something while they're there?

But let us know if you do end up succeeding in the pizza delivery idea!"
"I know a lot of people like this. I was tempted at first to say that it's unique to a particular brand of recent college graduate--the kind who call cooking ""adulting""--but I realized I know a bunch of mid-career professionals who do it too; I think they see it as a New York luxury akin to doormen and heavy reliance on rideshare apps."
"Knows what ""OP"" means, but pretends to not know what ""troll"" means... nice try."
"That simply won't work, sorry. There's no way a restaurant would even take your order, because they can't get the pizza through.

JFK is full of restaurants, some rather good. They may be uncomfortable and unhappy, but they won't starve. 

Sweet gesture, though! "

The story above raises multiple legal issues. Here are just a few.

**Criminal**

If you take and carry away someone's property with the intent of depriving the owner of possession permanently, you commit the crime of Larceny.  A creative prosecutor might well come up with additional charges.  If the victim is elderly, this is one of those cases that really piss off jurors and judges no matter what their ages are.  

**Civil** 

a) Taking someone's property without permission is called Conversion.  You can probably add Trespass to Property onto this.  Based upon my experience in the Small Claims Part of Civil Court, I would say that the facts presented would inspire any judge to try and figure out how to award the maximum amount of damages.
 
b) Court Orders.  Especially with an elderly person, a judge can issue an Order of Protection for the victim or another type of Restraining Order.  I personally would ask for 500 feet minimum.  If OP needs to move, too bad.

**Evidence**
  
a) Everyone in a public place within the State of New York can be photographed and/or recorded at least visually, without consent as long as the intent is purely surveillance for security.  (You cannot do this in bathrooms and certain other places nor can you take pictures of the parts of the body that are normally not visible to people walking down the street.)

b) All the postings of OP, even if deleted, were recorded on Reddit's servers. At the minimum, they have his IP address and might well have his MAC address as well.  This makes it possible to identify who wrote these messages.  

**Common Decency:**  

If newspapers and mail are piling up in front of your neighbor's door, perhaps you should check on his well-being or ask the police to do so.

"So long as you tip extra - and everyone who orders in weather like this should be tipping extra, you monsters - then it's all good. Delivery guys showed up to work knowing they will be sent out so you are certainly not being an asshole for asking them to come out. Just know it sucks outside, so be that super awesome delivery who tips a lot and makes them feel like it was worth coming in to work."
"I work in Midtown and live in Brooklyn.  At 8:50AM today I get an email saying that the office is closed and we should turn back around if we're on our way.  Of course everyone's on their way, it's 8:50AM!"
There is a recent [Grub Street/NY Mag article](http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/11/halal-cart-chicken-and-rice-oral-history.html) that tries to cover the history. 
"I think it was painted on the roof of [34 W 22nd Street New York, NY 10010](https://www.google.com/maps/place/34+W+22nd+St,+New+York,+NY+10010/@40.7414473,-73.9923205,72m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c259a37e441183:0xbb6959867acf104c!8m2!3d40.741462!4d-73.992067)

I looked through my photo collection from all of the rooftops (ESB, WTC, Rock) for the distinctive parapets, from every direction, then compared the lines of sight and this matched up closest."

Oh my god please continue. This is great. I found a god damn Unicorn and you are perfect. Please for the good of mankind continue doing what you do you beautiful Unicorn!
"My copy of the WSJ gets stolen once in a while if I oversleep (busy foot traffic street). It's the most disappointing start to the day — there are few routines that are as enjoyable as reading the newspaper while eating breakfast. Newspaper subscriptions are not that expensive, especially if you  are as successful as  you claim to  be. There ought to be a special hell for people that steal newspapers."
"Went to a NYE concert where a guy I was semi-seeing and his band were playing. I had planned on surprising him, because I originally thought I couldn't make it. 

Midway through the show he's like ""I'm dedicating this next song to a special lady. She said she couldn't make it but I just spotted her in the audience, and I couldn't be happier."" My heart was a-flutter. 

""Here's to you, Anna."" My name is not Anna. I honestly thought I was going to die then and there. As soon as I could escape, I ran out of the venue, crying all the way down Essex. Stopped in a bodega, bought a six pack of Coors Light, and drank them on the train ride home. "
Monthly nut? Someone got you locked in chastity?
"80-100k is plenty for a person. You won't be living a life of high luxury, but you could definitely find a one bedroom or studio apartment an easy commute from Times Square at a price you could afford. There are sizable communities of Irish expats in NYC and they are often pretty tight knit. Having this as an option will make socializing easy if you're open to hanging with your fellow countrymen. 

That said, if you'd rather not rely on your previous residency to establish social networks, it takes about a year of actively working to put yourself out into the world to really build a solid network of casual friends and acquaintances. 

In my mind, the big questions of living in NYC are 1) can I afford it and 2) do I want to afford it. You certainly can, so the question is want. If I were in your shoes, I would make sure that I had an exit strategy and I'd give it ago for two years. Why the fuck not? Might as well while you are relatively young (30 is the new 20 in NYC) and financially able to, especially if your company will deal with all of the immigration shit. "
The apartments in Girls and Broad City are pretty realistic. 
"Bideawee is a great no-kill animal shelter - they take great care of the animals there.  

I also like City Harvest, which works to round up leftover restaurant food that would go into the garbage and gets it to hungry people."

Always help him out like stealing his newspaper for 9 months. I wish we all had helpful neighbors like you.
"Do you think you're in LA? First of all, you're not. Second of all, I'm a mod of this sub and the OP of the BOLA thread, please don't participate in threads you find on drama subs, thanks."

"Apparently it was a bad brokers fee because YOU DONT HAVE HEAT IN THE WINTER. But yea, totally stick it to the system by staying in a substandard living situation. I never questioned why they would be retaliating, but either you get heat and they retaliate or you live without heat and should move anyway. "
We should be careful.  He probably has a really BIG button. 
Moving to NYC when you're someone who is super susceptible to the opinions of others to this point is going to not be healthy for you. NYC is a place where it is really really easy to fall into competition with your peers - and there will always be someone better than you here.
