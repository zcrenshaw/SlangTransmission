That's so sweet. Sounds like the mom is teaching independence along with manners. A+
"By her logic, I can just walk into a store, drop and break something that I really wanted, and get one for free.... Hmm, I think it's time to go to the jewelry store and drop some delicate jewelry!

All joking aside, does she not realize that since she never paid for it, she has no legal claim to it, or to compensation from the lack of it. Wanting something does not make it yours."
That's the type of thing I'd think to say two days after the incident in the shower
Be glad he's no longer a customer.
I don't know if I'd ever be able to muster 65 dollars' worth of honesty
You did give her a free drink: the one she dropped and wasn't charged for.
"""I get paid by the hour, lady. You wanna complain for 8 hours? Go ahead. I can stand here all day and get paid."""
"I freeze up in situations like this, so I've gotten very good at repeating ""I understand, but I need proof of purchase to process this"" so I can handle these situations professionally without stuttering. I have no idea where in the hell this snark came from, and I'll probably talk about this for the rest of my life."
"It amazes me that people these days believe that a manager must always be on duty, at all times. Where I work, w don't even have an assistant manager. Just the GM, and he's not there all day, every day. So we just have certain people thay we pretend are the assistant managers when they're wroking."
"Me&gt;Turn around

RM&gt;Every now and then I need a guide to some plimsoles that I wish to try on and maybe buy.

Me&gt;Turn around, bright eyes.

RM&gt;Every now and then I fall apart."
Having to pay for the shipping myself I would **definitely** care where you tried to send it to!
He can yell for ten minutes with a severely full bladder but not walk over to another bathroom. Which would probably take less time. I think he may have been over stating the prostate thing. 
Did he think the entire city just pools together all the income or something. 
"&gt;But I'm also not trying to return myself to the hospital.

Ask an impertinent question, get an impertinent answer! Excellent burn, I congratulate you! "
"That's what I was going to say! If my five year old buys a toy with ""chore money"" (he swiffers our living room) he has to pay the cashier and get his change. "
"I understand the question at first. Second time, maybe just a clarification?

Third and fourth time? Sorry, I think this model is too advanced for you. "
"So... on a super-busy weekend, she wanted 20 pounds of Roma tomatoes in a crate all nice and picked out for her already waiting... with no special order. She can go piss up a rope..."
"I'm 37 and this kid handled the call better than I would have.

you: ""I'm sorry, we only have the low top vans in all black""

me since I didn't rehearse this unexpected turn of events in advance: ""uhhh... ok bye then""

30 seconds after hanging up: ""uh fuck I could have bought those"""
I am never going to come here again = I will be here tomorrow bright and early.
"""So your opinion of good service is to abandon the customers I'm helping in order to help you? And what of THEIR opinions of ME, if I choose to do so?"" 

I've actually said this before. "
"Stop caring, OP.  Some people are just looking for reasons to be angry."
It was probably 50 years of imagining he shopped there.
"Silly rabbit, logic has no place in retail!"
That's cute. Whenever a kid is using their chore money or birthday money with me I always try extra hard to reinforce whatever their parent is teaching by counting change back very deliberately etc 
"I does seem obvious, but I still remember department stores that kept their own accounts and if you had an account you could simply show ID and they'd add it to your ""account "".

Also, if you had the card, it wasn't magnetic, it was just pressed into a carbon paper slip, no computer! "
"&gt;that she was a business woman and blah blah,

If she was a ""real"" business woman she should understand how pricing and sales are not determined by the employee."
"I had to do it with $33.00 worth of honesty. My total at the antique mall came out to $33.30, but somehow the buttons must not have registered for the first two 3s, because I only got charged 30 cents. Good thing I happened to look at the receipt, normally I just shove it in my purse to deal with later. I have definitely been on the other side of the register in this position, and it definitely sucks to have to pay for such a silly mistake. "
"Notebook or no, that attitude will ensure she fails once she has a tantrum to her professor. "
I think you found the crackers!
"Yeah, for sure. I think he was just pissy, hah, in general. Saw him later that day looking sullen with his assumed wife. "
"""I'll be a witness in your case!""

Oh boy. I'd love to see that case make court. "
I guess he figured that he was a tourist so his money would be counted separately than a resident's somehow?? I have no idea. I had so many people who just did not think before they spoke to me.
"Yay, I'm debt free! Better go put myself back into debt immediately......... o.O"
"I bet she's one of those people that clearly reads 'HAND WASH ONLY' on the item description online, and then leaves a 1 star review because it was ruined after she put it in the dishwasher....... 

I really dislike those people......"
"Yes, I know this feeling. For most of last week, the National Pharmacy I work at added a donation prompt to the pin pad whose proceeds would go toward the Red Cross for Hurricane Harvey relief.

Because customers are pretty dense and incapable of figuring out pin pads, whenever I'm on the register (which doesn't happen often, as I'm now a keyholder/manager) I have to narrate the checkout process for a good 60% of them. When we got to the donation prompt, a good 90% of my customers started hemming and hawing and regaling me with all the wonderful things they already do for charity and blah blah blah in an effort to excuse their obvious reluctance to donate.

Sir/madam, I'm not judging you and I frankly. *Don't. Care.* Just answer the damn question and we can move on with our lives, FFS.

I have no idea why people get so self-conscious and bent out of shape over this. Just do what I do in these situations--politely decline and move on. The vast majority of retail employees don't care about your reasons for donating (or not), nor how much you already do for charitable endeavors.

I expect I'll be repeating this next week after Irma makes landfall."
"I was in a craft store shopping after work and got into line to check out and this bitchy woman (I swear, I only actively see rude people in crafting stores) is 2 people ahead of me huffing and puffing because there's one checker.  I heard the checker call overhead for assistance up front and right after she puts the receiver down bitchy lady goes ""can you PLEASE get someone up here to get this hurried along?? I have to get back to work!"" The lady said she'd just called someone.  

I don't normally shoot my mouth off because I'm not confrontational, but it just hit me wrong so I said to bitchy lady ""hey, maybe if you have a limited lunch you shouldn't be stopping by a busy store during peak hours??""  She told me to shut the fuck up so I smiled and said ""I hope the rest of your day is as pleasant as you are.""  "
Sometimes it's worth firing a customer. He saved you the trouble and resigned.
ET phone home?
"IC: Do you have a birth certificate?

u/wrydera: I understand, but I need proof of purchase to process this.

;) "
"Kind of brilliant. She's afraid she'll have to pay for the item she broke, but by turning it around on you, you feel relief when she finally leaves (without paying for the broken item, of course). 
/r/UnethicalLifeProTips"
You laugh but I have done this and it's just as mortifying as it sounds
"Thirty-two cents. I'd say I have no words. But cheapskate, skinflint, and miser are right there. Also tightwad.

"
This makes me think of Wizards using Muggle money for some reason.
That's awesome! So far all of the cashiers have done the same thing. It makes him happy and I can tell that the cashiers are tickled to have a five year old pay for his own Transformer. lol
Get a generator and risk life and limb to install a hardrive into his laptop DUH!
"An incident comes to mind when I was a DM at a Wally world, 

Customer: places pre-paid cell phone on counter.

Employee: scans said phone,
Total comes to 100$

Customer: uhhhh no, that phone is 25$, 

Employee: ok well it's ringing up 100$.

Customer: IDGAF what it's ringing up it said 25$

Employee: pages his boss (Me).

Me: hey guys, what's going one? (Cheery Mc,cheery)

Employee: this custo.......(gets cut off by Customer)

Customer: this guy (employee) charging too much for this phone!!

Me: ok, show me.

Customer: leads me to place where he says phone is.

Me: oh I see the issue, you chose this phone (pricey 1)  right next to that phone (cheap one).

Customer: IDGAF, this phone is supposed to be 25$.

Me:....................

Customer: well what you gonna do about this??

Me: I am going to fix this issue for you.

Customer: damn right you are.

Me: (we walk back to cash out), I take pricey phone replace with 25$ phone.

Customer: WTF you doin?

Me: selling you the 25$ phone you want.

Customer: no I want this phone (again holding pricey phone) for 25$.

Me: Nope, not gonna happen, you actually believe I am gonna sell a 100$ phone for 25$??, A phone you admitted to being next to the 25$ phone?

Customer: (insert rants about my relationship with my mother, and the ability to do stuff to myself that is not anatomicaly impossible).

Me: thank you have a good night.
(I Walk away at this point).



Outcome: Customers, they suck..

   

Edit: Forgot to add Customer did not buy any phone that day.

SrryðŸ˜Ž"
You did well to keep your cool. People like this really annoy the hell out of me!
Very good boss. I am pleased.
"I mean, where I work, if corporate ever came in and we don't have a manager working we automatically fail the corporate inspection. 

But, then again, it's fast food."
Never heard of a store that sells bananas individually to be honest. 
"""I am never coming back here!"" = I will basically take up residence in this store forever"
"either needs more meds or less, i can't tell."
I AM A CHILD WITH NO SENSE OF RESPOSIBILITY LET ME JUST DEMAND DISCOUNTS FOR BEING EITHER STUPID OR A LIAR FOLLOWED BY DESTORYING HALF THE STORE! Who does this? 
"Either this really was a confused/forgetful customer, or a casual confidence artist.  They'll try this con every time they purchase something, and every once in a while they'll end up with an extra $10...
Wizard's First Rule and all that..."
"""i've done it before"" = ""i've never done it before but I hope by saying this you'll just magically give me free stuff"""
"&gt;WE JUST SPENT $150 ON BRUNCH.


Well looks like he should have asked them for a discount."
exactly. we offered our time to hand pick them for her but i guess it takes her less time to complain and go to customer service than to wait for us to actually give her the product she wanted.
