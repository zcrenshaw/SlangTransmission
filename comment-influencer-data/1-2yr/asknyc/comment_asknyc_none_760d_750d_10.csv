Anywhere. People do this all the time all over the city
Apparently - under my windows at night.
Walk slowly. Zig-zag when walking so you can't go past them. Walk side-by-side with their friends so they take up the whole sidewalk.
Subway's fine at night.  Your biggest issue might be irregular service/longer wait times trying to catch the subway at 3:30am.
"Manhattan or Williamsburg Bridge, right as the subway is passing. No one will hear you. "
don't complain about the mexican food here. it'll incite a fair amount of eyerolls. 
"People who move into a new building or area and then complain about neighbors or businesses that have been there for years and expect the older tenants to change their habits to suit their petty needs.

Yeah, fuck off."
"You go to the far right of the stairwell and just start going down the stairs. People know that they're supposed to give that side to you, but you have to actually take it. "
"If you have the means, rent a car and scream in traffic like every other American"
Go join a protest and scream there. You can relieve stress and express your beliefs. Two birds one stone man
A sheet cake.
"Me, won't order."
"Being a senseless dick because they have it in their mind that being a ""real new yorker"" involves being a senseless and insufferable asshole "
"South brooklyn is without a doubt the home of eastern european culture in America. Not only russian, but ukrainian and jewish as well. 

There are nearly 750,000 people of eastern european descent in Brooklyn out of a total of 1.05 million white people, of which about 155,000 are direct immigrants from eastern europe, including myself. Most came in the 90s and 2000s, so they are pretty new and still have russian culture. It is why neighborhoods like sheepshead bay and brighton beach still have half the signs in russian. 

It is actually pretty shocking to many outsiders to see just how much eastern european culture has stayed in south brooklyn, immigrants from russia and ukraine are usually stereotyped as the ones who came in the 1880-1930 period, but brooklyns eastern european population is mostly from the post soviet union era.

The amusement park rides at Luna Park on Coney Island.
Just wanted to thank OP for giving a shit about other people and trying to not be a dick.  If only all new parents were this considerate.
"Also- never engage crazy. Across the board. Crazy guy on train, don't make eye contact. Don't open the doors to them singling you out in whatever they are doing. If you are standing in a spot on a train and some crazy motherfucker comes up and stands next to you and starts yelling crazy shit, just non-chalantly move the fuck along. Go to another car if you have to. There's a lot of people on the street with mental illnesses unfortunately. You can really reason with that when they are in a fit of craziness. "
"Crossing against the light while deeply immersed in their facebook feed.

"I've found the chain restaurants inside the city (in Manhattan, at least) to be far below the quality of the same chain restaurants outside the city. The food is nearly double the price (without the deals available elsewhere) and you get shriveled chicken fingers, soggy fries, half-frozen burgers. There's so many better options here, I don't get why you'd want to go to one of these chain places, especially since they often feel like lesser versions of themselves here."

"You can hire an attorney. You could also figure out what you think you should reasonably compensated for and send them a letter demanding that. If they don't give in, you can consider filing in small claims court. "
"I'm gonna skip subway stuff, because I think we've had fucking ten thousand threads on that, but:

* people in my building who just moved here from fucking wherever yokel hell hole think that the mailman is going to take back wrongly delivered mail or something. You have to write ""RETURN TO SENDER"" and drop it somewhere. Postal workers here don't pick up and if you weren't an abject moron, you'd know it because the pile in the lobby just grows and grows and grows.
* people who look at their phone while going up or down stairs. Fuck you. Fuck you all. You walk slow as all hell and there's never room to get around you while you plod like a damn buffalo. Wait until you're off the stairs and then do whatever stupid unimportant bullshit you're doing.
* using the flash on their phone to take pictures for their instagram in bars and restaurants. I don't care that you're the kind of loser who does this, but can you be the kind of loser that doesn't fuck the ambiance with your flash?
* pushing to the front of the sidewalk crowd at a busy intersection and not jay walking. Wait in the back if you're going to wait for the light to change. "
"The loud music. Either coming from your apartment or blasting it from your phone, like you're a DJ or something. **NO ONE WANTS TO LISTEN TO YOUR OBNOXIOUS MUSIC**. Put some headphones on."
"If I'm not mistaken the only alt-right type protest that was planned for this weekend in New York City was against Google, but those have subsequently been canceled due to bullshit ""alt-left terror threats"" aka we don't want to be outed in public in the most liberal city in America. "
"The Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn is also called ""Little Odessa.""

You may be interested in this [interactive language map](http://gothamist.com/2016/10/31/language_map_nyc.php) of New York City, which show the predominant non-English languages spoken in different areas of NYC.  There are multiple areas where Russian is the predominant language.

The biggest thrust of Russian immigrants came in the late 70s through the 90s.  Currently, I believe its more likely for Ukranians to be new immigrants. "
"I think you're going to have a great time! I do feel I should warn you that most of the places you'll go might not have the romantic feel you may expect from movies. There's a lot of garbage out by the curbs (this is always the thing that surprises first time visitors, in my experience), and you'll notice some gross smells, especially in summer. That said, summer in the city can be very beautiful, too. 

Some suggestions: 

-a trip inside the main branch of the library is definitely worth it. Same goes for Grand Central Station.

-for the subway, rely on google maps or another trip planner thing, and if you get confused in the station, just ask somebody who looks local for help. Most people are nice and happy to give guidance, and it will be faster than trying to decipher the map.

-shake shack is tasty, but I don't think it is so life-changing that you need to break your vegetarian diet over it. Up to you. There is plenty of great vegetarian food in the city. 

-for shopping, it sounds like you might enjoy a place like Uniqlo. There are a few locations, but i prefer the one in Soho (Broadway between spring and prince).

That's all I can think of for now, but happy to answer any other questions. You seem to have a positive attitude, so I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself whatever you do."
This post gave me cancer.
"If he's not threatening, and isn't in danger himself, the police are the wrong people to call.

If the noise bothers you at night, file a noise complaint with 311. 

If you are concerned about this human being's welfare, you can request homeless assistance through the 311 app. 

Otherwise, welcome to New York.

"There really isn't one, there's always a conference or wedding or concert or sporting event to keep the prices up. "" the city that never sleeps"" has less to do with our 24 hour businesses and more to do with our lack of seasonality. While out and out tourism dips a few times in the year there's still plenty of people traveling here for business or comicon or fashion week etc. Hell hotels in midtown book up when Canadian hockey teams play in The garden."
"Start in Dumbo. Walk south along the water and either 1) go up to brooklyn heights and walk the brooklyn promenade, or 2) stay close to the water and walk through brooklyn bridge park.   

Then at some point cut east and explore boerum hill/cobble hill/carroll gardens and eventually keep walking east and get over gowanus and explore park slope before seeing prospect park.  

You'll be exhausted by then."
It's definitely a good school for Engineering and you really can't beat the price.
I moved from LA to NYC.  You will not find any mexican food here that you think is good
"Search this subreddit. This has been asked a million times and the general consensus is that Californians are never going to be happy with Mexican food here. I believe someone posted once that you could be knocked out, flown to California, given a burrito or taco or whatever there, but as long as you thought you were still in NYC, you'd be unhappy. In my experience, that's utterly true."
"I use it all the time:

"I think a big part of New York that hasn't been mentioned is its pride in diversity and commitment to the success of the city as a whole. New York has a HUGE immigrant population and you can find every single language in the world spoken in Queens alone. Sit in Central Park for an hour, and you're guaranteed to hear at least 10 languages. Most New Yorkers I know love this and are quite proud of it. 

People tend to think New Yorkers are rude and callous because of first impressions. The truth I've discovered about New York is that everyone ignores each other and is a bit rude until someone really needs help, in which other New Yorkers will always be there to help you out. 

Just the fact that Central Park still exists is emblematic of how dedicated New Yorkers are to preserving the city. It's estimated the land alone is worth $35 billion. Also, the city notoriously comes together in pursuits of bizarre justice (see: dogs in bags on subway).

New Yorkers are very proud of how bizarre NYC is. There is no typical resident (you can have a new 80 year old immigrant, or a 20 year old yuppie working at Goldman). Halal carts are essential along with bagels. "
People YOU talk to never talk about the Bronx. 
"Senseless chest beating and boasting over particular fad foods and restaurants as being a iconic NYC thing when the place in question is a blatant rip off or slight tweak of another area's staple or creation. 

I get no ideas are original and everyone copies everyone but the way people talk about some places as if they were NYC's gift from god, makes me roll my eyes. 


Anyone who knows of Culver's knows that Shake Shack had very few original ideas to bring to the table. "
"That's way better than the ""I just moved to East Harlem where are the Sephora and Dave and Buster's"" guy."
I have a job. I also have a responsibility to raise social issues that I think are important. 
"Yes, they do. They won't shut up about it, in fact. "
"Just don't do it.  Between Uber Eats, Caviar and Postmates that restaurant will be on one of those sites and more of the money will go to the person who actually delivers your food."
"so, in lots of upscale neighborhoods the Mexican restaurants are owned by white people, operated by whoever shows up, and sell food mostly to the office lunchbreak crowd. that's decent food but it's not particularly authentic. just a notch above Chipotle. 

but if you go to an actual Mexican neighborhood, like for example Sunset Park on 5th ave, you'll find lots of restaurants owned and operated by Mexicans selling food mostly to Mexicans. that's the good stuff. "
"&gt;How do you say buy a microwave from Wal-Mart and get it to your home?

There are no Wal-Marts in NYC, FYI.

 You order it from amazon and its delivered to your home or an Amazon Locker of your choosing. 

Or you buy it at the corner discount store and bring it home in a wheelie cart.

Or you pay someone on Taskrabbit to buy one for you.

Or you buy it at Target and take a cab home.

"Yes, the subway will be fine. As other commenters mentioned, the biggest issue will be longer wait times.

If your company is big and well-known, you should inquire about car service. Most companies I've worked for offer complementary car service or access to company Uber account if it requires you to commute at odd hours."
