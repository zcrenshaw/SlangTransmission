"(1) Don't have time for that shit, (2) plenty of nut jobs that I'd rather not confront, (3) cops probably have bigger things to worry about, (4) I have bigger things to worry about, and (5) if you're going after someone and shaming them, you better be right."
"A combination of two things. It regularly gets brigaded by trolls from other subs because of NYC‚Äôs reputation for liberalism and tolerance, and the mods don‚Äôt do jack shit. Moreover, the contingent of racists that do exist in NY (and they are there, they just generally keep their traps shut in mixed company) have found it a safe space because of the brigades and lax modding. "
"Eastern queens so I don‚Äôt have to take a fucking 40 minute bus ride to get to the subway. Just extend the F or the E. 

Also anything between Queens/Brooklyn so that the G isn‚Äôt the only option. "
"There‚Äôs a lotta crazy people, so it‚Äôs a bad idea to stop strangers from doing dumb shit.   At best they stop mildly inconvencing you, at worst you‚Äôre attacked or get into a yelling match (and maybe a viral video?).  Not worth it.  
Cops usually have bigger fish to fry.  And if the person committing the offense looks homeless, they don‚Äôt want to bother with taking them in or writing them a citation."
"Planned Parenthood on Bleeker Street. They accept insurance. I don't remember the insurer I had at the time but the entire bill only came out to about $65 total (this included visit, exam, ultrasound, blood test, and medication for the procedure). "

"When it gets cold, it will turn on.  If it doesn‚Äôt, look to see if there‚Äôs a knob that‚Äôs closed.  If so, ask your super (or try turning it...).

The more likely problem will be that there‚Äôs two radiator temperatures:  1. Off, and 2. Holy hot hell are you trying to cook me?  If you get the latter, turn on your Bronx air conditioner.  (That means open a window.)"
"Because this city is a huge melting pot of different cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, and mental issues. If i spent all day trying to stare down and correct people, I would drive myself insane in a few days. It's just not worth the stress. As long as it isn't posing an immediate harm to myself or people around me, I just want to focus on earning my paycheck, and enjoying my free time. Like you mentioned, this city has 8.5 million residents, so you can imagine the population when tourists are included. This doesn't excuse their shitty behavior, but i have my own mental well being and health to look out for. And yes, cops are busy, very busy, so dealing with a person dropping a wrapper on the ground is not worth their time if someone is getting jumped a block over. "
You need to immediately talk to the police and speak with your landlord.
"Subway and bus issues...infrastructure, delays, etc. "
also take the A train up to the Cloisters (part of the Met Museum). a great place to disappear into another century. 
"We have actively encouraged lowering the priority of ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù issues because (at least in the US), it tends to be code for ‚Äúharassing poor and minorities‚Äù. "
No reason why you‚Äôd be in any trouble but I would seek a living arrangement that isn‚Äôt paid weekly to live with a stranger you know nothing about.
"I second this. BEWARE: On the first Saturday of every month, garbage humans from ~~Cathedral of Saint John the Divine~~ The Basilica of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral protest/harass en mass out front of this location. Just a heads up.  

edit: wrong church "
"New York has nearly 2.5x as many people as Berlin in a 12% smaller footprint. IMO, it makes sense that small-time quality of life issues like litter or the rare scooter-on-the-train occur more frequently in a city this dense. 

Just a tip on how to survive ny: try to notice the literal millions of people around you behaving properly rather than focus on the few who suck. Oh, and mind ya business! 

Welcome to New York!"
10%. I‚Äôve been in the same apt for 15 years. Even with salary increases I stayed in a small apartment with great rent so I can save. 
part of the reason you may feel this way is you are underage. a whole new can of worms is about to open for you in a few months mate
well this whole thread is infuriating.
"That host is lying, doing really sketchy shit, sharing a bedroom with multiple people, or has been living in the same apartment since the 1960s."
"When it gets cold you‚Äôll hear the pipe sing you the sound of its people. Then the radiator will heat up your apartment hotter than Satan‚Äôs asshole, and you‚Äôll have to open the window. "
This seems like... The opposite of what I should/did do
I am going to pretend I didn't read this and attempt to live in blissful ignorance.
"It's this. There is definitely tons of t_d scum on here and the other nyc-related subs. But rest assured there are tons of racists in NYC itself from Staten Island to Breezy Point to the NYPD. NYC isn't nearly as racially tolerant as it likes to pat itself on the back for being. Look anywhere from Upper West Siders foaming at the mouth at the thought of black kids from Uptown entering their schools, to deBlasio cutting legal aid for immigrants, to hipster racists dropping the n-word even in public. And the mods are happy to give a platform to all of the above."
Tell the dogs‚Äô owners.
"Report her to the building management that recommended her. If she works through a service, report it to them. But jfc, get outta here with this ‚Äúor do animals have no rights‚Äù bullshit. "
I proposed to the woman who ended up cheating on me at Asiate in the Mandarin Oriental overlooking Columbus Circle/Central Park. It was very romantic. Afterwards we went to the strip club. Maybe that was a red flag. 
"With no concern for cost or optimal populations served: 

* starting at 96th St on the 1/2/3  
* transfers at 96th/CPW, 96th/Lex, and 96th/2nd

* onwards to LaGuardia  
* then south through Jackson Heights and Elmhurst with transfers along the way  
* following the M along Myrtle Ave  
* transfer to the G at Myrtle-Willoughby
* terminates at the Franklin Ave C/S stop"
"He does not control the MTA, but he does control the streets. Why don‚Äôt we have unblocked bus lanes and placard reform already? Why are sidewalks that are literally overflowing with people in midtown and the Financial District not being expanded?"
"This is all wrong on all kinds of levels. I don‚Äôt even know where to start. If it really is rent regulated, it would be stabilized, not controlled. And you can‚Äôt charge more than the legal rent. And paying more and getting a refund is totally insane. Run from this situation if you can. "
"I went and experienced this during the week. In my experience they had escorts to kind of shield you and shuttle you inside. I do not know who the woman was that saw the look on my face, grabbed me and pushed my head against her chest while shielding my eyes until I was inside the doors. Whoever you are thank you. "
"Lmfao no it‚Äôs definitely not penthouse level. Sure, ‚Äúluxury‚Äù but in NYC all ‚Äúluxury‚Äù means is it has an elevator, doorman, and maybe a gym. Parking garage for an extra $400/month. "
Idk why you would want to spend time going to the mall when you have a finite amount of time in NYC.
"&gt; plenty of nut jobs that I'd rather not confront

This is really the crux of it for me. I see people litter or guys cat call all the time, but I have no clue how they'll respond to being chastised (which they deserve to be). That's an easy way to get your ass kicked. "
"I was raised New Yorker. A few key tenets:

1.  Mind your own business

2. If you don‚Äôt have anything nice to say, don‚Äôt say it at all.

3. Don‚Äôt cry over spilled milk.

4. Treat others the way you want to be treated.

"So, life is random and nothing is totally safe... but the risks here are relatively low.  So I wouldn‚Äôt freak out, but also wouldn‚Äôt lick any buildings this week.  (Next week, you should be totally clear to lick all the buildings you want.)"
It‚Äôll sound like your pipes are trying to fight the building.
"Honestly I think people aren't being ridiculous enough about the L shutdown - it's going to be worse than most people are imagining.

The shuttle buses will be a drop in the bucket in terms of replacing the lost capacity of the L. The practical real-life result will be a caravan of buses stuck in traffic, taking &gt; 1 hour to cross the Williamsburg bridge, and still end up moving a small fraction of the L train's capacity. The net result is that even if the city buys hundreds of new buses, a good portion of people who rely on the L will simply not be able to cross the river at all in a timely way.

I know that people want to be optimistic, but there's no evidence for optimism here. Transit systems follow the laws of physics - they do not have unlimited capacity, and you can't simply snap your fingers to bring more capacity into existence.

- The L train currently runs ~15 trains per hour during rush (per direction), each capable of holding ~980 people. As anyone who rides the L daily can tell you - passengers are already packing the train to the brim. That's about 15,000 passengers per hour streaming into or out of the city (depending on morning/evening).

- A typical city bus can hold about ~40 people. The longer accordion-style ones can hold ~60 people.

- To replace the L train with buses, you'd need 375 regular-sized buses, or 250 accordion buses, per hour. We don't have that many spare buses, or even that many spare drivers. But even if we did...

- That means you'd have to run a bus every 9.6 seconds (regular buses) to every 14.4 seconds (accordion buses). What does traffic look like with a bus ambling down Bedford Ave every 9.6 seconds? Does the street even *have* the capacity to move that many buses that quickly? Can you even unload/load/go at a bus stop in 9.6 seconds?

- Once you've somehow figured out how to run a bus every 9.6 seconds in Williamsburg, you've gotta figure out how to cross the bridge. The Williamsburg Bridge currently sees about 105,000 crossing a day and is already a nightmare at rush hour - now you add about ~500-800 more crossings per *hour* to get the buses moving across... and you've got a recipe for a lot of people sitting in a lot of traffic not going anywhere.

- Even accounting for passengers who will displace onto the 7, J, M, Z trains, this is an enormous number of passengers that we have no good way of moving over the river. Not to mention that the 7, J, M, and Z lines have little to no spare capacity. Even running more trains is not an option as the switches and tracks on those lines are already near-or-at capacity.

tl;dr: The L shutdown is going to be nightmarish, and I don't think most people outside of transit wonk circles fully comprehend just how awful it's going to be."
"Get on MetroNorth and head to the town of Cold Spring near Bear Mountain. Let's you off right in the middle of the village. Good restaurants, shops, views, bars, and hiking. No car needed."

Its a huge crisis here. A lot of people, especially on reddit which tends to be more the yuppie/hipster crowd, don't really comprehend just how bad the affordability crisis is in NYC. "
Homeless shelter placements and prisoner placement after Rikers shuts down and how he plans to deal with NIMBYs. 
"The fact that she's getting exclusive referrals for all new tenants suggests that she may have a personal connection to building management. They may even be getting a kickback. Still, you don't have much recourse other than reporting to management and/or posting a sign on the door. You also could've followed her to see which apartment she was returning the dog to and then talk to them later. If I was paying her I'd definitely want to know what's going on"
New Yorkers aren‚Äôt generally in the city because they want a suburban vibe 
"A really useful source of things to do is in Google Maps - Click ""Explore"" -&gt; ""Events"". Or you can use the app Eventbrite, it sells tickets to events of all kinds but also has tons of free events every day. "
"Maybe I‚Äôm nuts, but I vastly prefer the occasional douche on the subway to a police force running around and ticketing people for petty stuff like dog shit. "
Avoid taking the subway between 7:30-9:30 am and 5:00-6:30 pm. Carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer and a packet of good wipes. You can do this. 
Halal guys. Right outside my office on weeknight evenings. Just to fuck with my coworkers. 
"Japanese or Korean supermarkets will carry it - Sunrise Mart, Dainobu, HMart should all have it."
"This isn't a personal attack against you specifically, but there are so many women coming on here going on about how tiny and young and innocent-looking they are...do we have to have a national conversation about being smart and having common sense in the streets or something?

Look, a lot of my friends are small female asians (me included), and I promise you short females in their 20s are not a cohort of future victims. Just don't be stupid and remember that random gang members really don't care about you. They're rather focused on other gang members."
"You can really only report this to your landlord, so they stop recommending her. It's not like there's a dogwalker licensing board."
"YEP! As a young ‚Äòpetite‚Äô women this post got on my nerves. It would be different if OP asked ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not city-smart, is rigewood a safe area for 3 women to hang around?‚Äù

But this post has the vibe of a ‚Äúhelp i‚Äôm sooo young and vulnerable and super duper scared‚Äù with a 20+ year old woman. 

Like ‚Äúoh sorry, ridgewood is no good for you. But on the upper west side there‚Äôs a penned-in one block radius where young vulnerable petite women can be safe and secure. You have to be between 21 and 24 to be allowed in and the security guard checks to make sure that you‚Äôre either female, or possess muscle mass low enough to not be considered a threat. An adult comes by every half hour to make sure everyone‚Äôs doing ok and hand out Pedialyte packets in case of hangovers.‚Äù"
I'd connect Greenpoint to Manhattan and Astoria to Brooklyn. 
There really is no uncreepy way to approach someone on the subway.
"As everyone has said, Planned Parenthood, in the city or otherwise (I have always gone to LIC), is fantastic. The people who work there are there because they want to help people like you and others, so they are incredibly kind and nonjudgmental. "
