Because someone was mean to you does not mean you aren't worthy of being loved.
This is so pure ❤

I would never give my money to a country that actively persecuted gays. There are so many other places to go on vacation.

I will say thank you for looking out for this guy.

"&gt;Have y'all had friends that when drunk would sleep with anything that had a pulse?

In Texas we call them Three Beer Queers.

Yes, it's a thing. More common in homophobic areas though.

"No, not at all. That's literally what I value more in a relationship than sex. I mean, sex is great, but I'd just love a relationship where he just cuddles and kisses me all the time. "

"No matter where you live, no matter how many people says that being gay is something wrong, you didn't choose to be like this. Don't let yourself believe that you're a worse human being, that you're ugly, disgusting or sinful. Don't be afraid to love yourself, you deserve this."

Everyone already knows you're gay"
"I was living with my mom and my uncle called me from texas.


He told me 


""Being gay is not normal, its clear that your father absence made you what you are, i know a place that takes fags and sets them in the right path of god""


He was telling me how he was going to pay for a ticket to texas so i can go to conversion therapy in the USA.


I did not say anything and i was mentally getting ready to fight my family if my mom allowed it.


I passed the phone to my mom and she went to her room and talk to my uncle. I put my ear to her door and my first thought was that my mom was going to say yes but she ended up yelling at my uncle for suggesting that, and i heard her say.





&gt;He is gay and i regret kicking him out but he is my son i love him no matter what. I'm proud of what he has done in school, he is smart and he is more man then anyone in our family.





When i heard that it made me feel better, before this call she did kicked me out and then let me back in but to hear her say that made me feel happy and loved."
I think they got it wrong. He was requesting a hung gay. 
I was annoyed that my roommate decided to stop having sex with me all the time.
I have had guys literally shove their hand down my pants at clubs.

"Your world does not stop at the ripe age of 25 unless you allow it to.

"Yes and no, pointing out hypocrisy isn't rude but they way you said it may have been - that said, it was a proportional response, well done."
You must be very young. 2008 was a very different time to be gay. The fact that Obama even mentioned gay people positively in his speeches felt amazing to me at the time. 
"Maintaining eye contact in the mirror while he tops me, while I top his son."

"...this is another one of those things Americans think are universal but are actually really America-exclusive and the rest of the world finds weird, isn't it?"
"My grandma did that with my husband. Kept referring to him as my wife because his physical attributes were more feminine than mine. My husband only allows me and his cousin (a girl) to joke with that kind of stuff. I talked to grandma a few times, she didn't listen.

Now I don't see her anymore. I'm sure she still says that shit behind our back. "
"Nothing really. He is just make inappropriate sexual jokes about us (which is weird).

"I am very extroverted, and kinda overconfident..so keep that in mind. 

I go to a strip club with all my friends, I hate it, chicks getting naked does nothing for me. We are chilling and I am eye fucking the bouncer. My friends notice and give me shit cuz I am seriously realizing dude is cute! 

So in front of them I walk up and start talking to the bouncer and ask for his phone number just thinking he will shoot me down. He just looks confused, and doesn’t really commit either way. So I am left kinda hanging just hanging and trying to recover from a dead end right? 

So I look at him and say, hey, dude, I just asked for your number, you gonna give it to me or what? He blushes pure red, explains that he has a hearing loss and didn’t understand what I was asking. I am fixing to just die when he reaches out and puts his hand behind my neck and kisses me, and all my friends are so bombed!

I totally can get action even in a straight strip club! "

A rare example of a date joke that works both sides of the Atlantic. 
"Take the time to calm down and then (in a couple of days/weeks) just calmly tell her exactly what you told us and how it is a big deal for your husband. Let her know that it takes absolutely no effort and that it would make a world of change to you and your husband if she avoided that kind of comment. 

She probably takes pride in the fact that you're (according to her) the man in the relationship, it probably helps her to cope with the fact that her son is gay. You can't change the way she sees the relationship, just ask her to keep it to herself. 

But also, your husband should try to take this kind of stuff a little bit less personal. Tons of people think the way your mom does and she may not be the only one who sees him as ''the girl''. I know it's tough, I too have problems with being seen as ''the girl'', but you can't change the world, you can only change the way it affects you. Please don't take advice like ''We won't see you anymore if you don't change'' cause good god she's your mom and she accepts you and your husband (as far as your post says). I'm sure regardless of wether she changes or not you guys will be able to accept your family as kookie as it is. "
"I don't support cheating, regardless of who does it. Gay or straight, it's a scummy thing to do.

Gay guys don't get to use ""oh but I'm still in the closet!!!"" as an excuse for shitty behavior. You're all at college. You're all adults.

First, you should tell him to man up and break up with her. If he refuses, then talk to your friend."
Yes it is beyond absurd. 
"Also, if you disappear for a while then come back with a new pic, it's like you're new meat all over again!"
At least she didn't see the grand finale. 
"I don't think adults or older generations really grasp just how much we as the millennial generation and generation Z are facing in regards to our futures and each other. This may be why be why adults belittle us so much or don't seem to understand us.

For one, most of our futures are really fucking bleak. It may turn out that it resolves over time, but for now, our opportunities are gradually in decline, and our societal and environmental quality slowly degrading. Assuming you're middle class, in order for us to live similar lives to our parents, our only option anymore is to go to college. But now, a bachelors degree is no longer a guarantee to those jobs, and often times we have to pay massive amounts of money we don't have in order to finance degrees. Meanwhile, we have a culture that is enabling corporations to fuck over our economy and environment to make a profit. 

In my lifetime alone, automation is expected to increase rapidly making much of human labor irrelevant, increasing competition for what little nice jobs are left, most likely meaning that I'll be working some shit job for the rest of my life. Oh, and on top of that, mass extinction and climate change thats going to ruin our planet.

So while we can still ""make it"" in todays world, it's becoming harder and harder, and only seems to be on the decline from here on out. So I don't really believe the future's gunna be all that great.

We turn to other things to relieve our stress. Alchohol, drugs, netflix, social media, and hook ups because we can't really afford to do anything else. But those aren't fulfilling. While the temporarily distract us, they're ultimate reminders that we're living unfulfilled lives. Social media makes us unable to socialize in person....alchohol, clubbing, and weed can often times make what little socializing we do vapid. (Though not all, but a significant portion). Hook ups are nice and all, but many of us what meaningful relationships too, but the standards or expectations seem to be getting higher.

Am I saying ALL young people feel this way? No. Probably most dont. Like I said, these are my personal reasons, they're probably not 100% accurate. But this is why I seem to keep myself up late at night, and why I know a lot of people my age do so as well.

The ultimate thing I can't understand is how the adults who built this world and set these trends and are running the place seem so surprised this is happening...."

"My best friend told me fairly early into our friendship, ""I find gay friends almost inevitably fool around once, just to get it out of their systems, and then the real friendship forms after"".

Fast forward one week and we're in bed sucking eachother off.

Fast forward 4 years and we're totally platonic best friends, but with a closeness that even my female best friends can't match."

"I'm not sure if my story fills the criteria since it has nothing to do with leaving out some object and having guests to notice it... but let me risk it.

One morning my friendly, beautiful female neighbor visited me and basically forced me to go on a spontaneous swimming-in-the-lake session. It was a hot summer, I was free from university, my better half was busy catching criminals... so I went for it.

Fortunately, it wasn't crowded. Or, should I say, unfortunately, because then I would never go there, lol. We sat on the beach, few meters from some group of friends and we were minding our own business. If I remember correctly, we were talking about her eternal crush on totally random, older guy, whose name she didn't even know at the time.

I can't say how, but I totally didn't notice that she stated giggling a lot when I took my shirt off. We went to the lake and these strangers near us bursted with laugh so suddenly... but I still haven't realized at the time, that I was the reason...

Well, imagine how I felt, when hour later my *very* funny friend revealed that I have something written on my back, with black marker. When she told me about it, it was the moment when I knew... I fucked up.

Short story... last night I had some rough sex and my BF wrote ""dump cum here ↓"" when he defeated me at wrestling... The arrow was obviously pointing at my ass...

My precious friend who thought it would be funny to let me parade with that still thinks it was hilarious..."
This is something every person in the planet needs to know.

"It's not really difficult with him, he's almost always in mood for sex, so theoretically that gives me a variety of ways. In practice, I rarely initiate because he's the one who really likes to do it.

For example, today I simply sat on his lap and started kissing his neck when he was ending his dinner. I got him a pretty hickey, we laughed and I started humping on his dick. He got hard really fast.

Sometimes I make an effort and I tease and seduce him when we're in public so he can't really get into action right away. After coming back home, he becomes a sex beast which needs few thrusts to cum. There are days when all I have to do is look at him and he will simply say ""alright, take off your clothes""..."
"He might have literal brain damage (possibly from the beatings he seems to be experiencing, possibly from some other source), which can cause the speech and communication problems you're describing. I knew someone once who had serious brain damage from being hit by a car and, even years later, would occasionally launch into word salad and be unable to communicate properly with people (including by written word) but was great at communicating and brilliant 90% of the time. That said, it's way beyond you to either diagnose him or otherwise get him help, and I think the best you can do is recommend to him that he see a therapist or doctor."
Now I have a Wal-Mart fetish. Thanks.

Actually I have asked him and he is super noncommunicative so all I have left is speculation..

"I had a half day at school so I thought we were in the clear for a couple hours. Got back to my house and both got butt naked, threw porn on the big screen in my living which was right by my front door. All of a sudden the door opens and in walks mom. There sat my friend and I completely erect, gay porn on the tv. She immediately goes back outside and leaves. Nothing was ever said nor did I intend on explaining. Who knows what she would of seen if it had been 20 minutes later lol "
"I’m sorry, but I’m not sure what the best course of action is here.

I just wanted to say: please don’t ask him if he is gay.   Either way, being asked that question is never a good feeling, especially since he is obviously in a shitty place in life.  I’d recommend taking it at nothing more than face value and treat him like any of their human that is hurting.  

Good luck, and good for you for actually caring!  It makes me happy to know that good people still exist.

"20 upvotes with lots of people disagreeing and talking about it below. Racial minorities having a strong preference for white men is something I see a lot of people discussing on a regular basis. After all, being a racial minority doesn't mean they're not also exposed to the same societal beauty standards that I am as a white guy. 

You also conveniently didn't link to the other thread you're talking about. Perhaps because that dicussion *also* had varying perspectives and maybe you're misrepresenting the tone of the thread because it might go against the point you're trying to make.

I don't know, this topic frustrates me. It's a lot easier/more convenient to justify preferences as non-racist than it is to reflect upon why we might have them and how society can influence us. People immediately want to distance ourselves from racism because we understand that it's a negative thing, but because of this we often refuse to be honest with ourselves about our own racism. Racist thoughts/preferences don't immediately make us terrible people, and I do think the world would be a better place if we were less viscerally defensive when the subject of racism came up. I wish we were more interested in listening and reflecting instead of dismissing and justifying.

As an anecdote, in the past when I'd browse porn, I'd see a thumbnail with bodies of men that interested me, but I would move on when I realised a person in it was black because black men were less attractive to me. I realised after a little while that it was kinda messed up, so I started actively seeking out porn with black men to see if I could move past it. The more I exposed myself to porn with black men in it, the more I found black men I was attracted to. Instead of dismissing it as ""just a preference"", I reflected with honesty about why I was scrolling past certain videos, then tried to see if I could change that about myself instead of just finding the next video with hot white guys in it.

Yes, I would have been entitled to have my preference, and I had no obligation to try to change it, but I'm glad I did. It was a racist preference. That didn't make me a bad person, it just meant that I'd been heavily influenced by the culture I grew up in, that it shaped my preferences, and that it was something I had to work on (it wasn't just something I could switch off overnight). 

I was still overall a decently good person back then, even with that racist preference, and I'd still say I'm a pretty good person now, even though I'm undoubtedly still influenced in innumerable ways by the culture I grew up in and continue to live in.

Of course, this is just a personal anecdote. I don't want to pretend to speak for everybody, but I'm sure as shit not the only person whose preferences have been influenced by where I grew up, how I grew up, and the people I was surrounded by."

"He is clearly not there for the expected experience. 

That’s enough to freak me out. Maybe he’s trying to work up the nerve to have sex with a woman but maybe he’s trying to work up the nerve to do something else. It’s probably not that but I doubt I could get it out of my mind. "
"&gt;post-depression break up phase

The 30s were a hard time for everyone.

But seriously, we all know the temptation of the 'curious' drunk guy. Question is how he'd react - I can absolutely handle the guys who can carry on as if it didn't happen. What I can't handle is unnecessary weirdness, it's just stress you really don't want in your life.

So you've got to try to judge how weird he's going to be, probably based on how he is with gay stuff generally. If he's admitted hooking up with guys in the past he's clearly not got too much of an issue. If this isn't some deep friendship you might fuck up, I'd say go for it."

"First year, we did not do much. We went out to a nice restaurant and bought him a game he really loved. It was pretty simple. But I went all out for our 10 year anniversary booked a trip to London, had a fancy dinner, cuddled in a private Eye capsule, and proposed to him."

"I left Romania 6 years ago and I only go back to visit my parents. I moved to Spain and my life changed dramatically, it wasn´t and it isn´t easy but I´m happier. I sleep well at night, I don´t have to hide anything, I´m not afraid of holding my husbands´ hand outside out of fear that someone might beat me to death. 

Yes, Romania is a great country, tha nature, the history, the churches (even if you´re not religious, some of them are incredible, they worth a visit once in your lifetime), people are more open about things then 10 years ago, especially in big cities. Still, hate crimes are not even treated as hate crimes, religion is still a big part of most peoples´ lives, you have a lot of extremists there still.

"Yes, you are missing something - attraction to men.  You are straight, so you are attracted to women.  Of course you wouldn't get anything out of hooking up with a guy - you aren't attracted to men.  Just as you are attracted to a woman's face and body, gay men are attracted to men's face and body.  As for specifics - different people will probably emphasize different things for what they are attracted to about men.  If I were to list off the things I am attracted to about men, I'd end up just listing off every part of their body - I like men's faces, chest, arms, abs, cock, ass, legs."

My personal opinion is he is way too self-involved about his own issues that he is completely disregarding your needs. It sounds like you are doing all the work to keep him satisfied. **Is he doing the same for you?** If anything, he sounds insecure and super-possessive of you.

The facts is he doesn't respect your needs or your marriage, and is willing to cheat and let your life and your happiness wither away until both of you are miserable."

I will say, I fell in love kicking and screaming the entire way.  In the past I'd always thought about love as a weakness, or as a way to give another person power over yourself.  Which is true, in a way.  I was dead set on never getting married, or entering a serious relationship.  Ever.  

Cue *boy* 

He's beautiful.  He's interesting.  He's funny.  We come from as different of backgrounds as possible.  He's got an accent so I have to lean in to hear him when he talks.  I'm forced to pay attention.  I'm intrigued, so I agree to meet up with him for a second then a then a third date.  

Every night before we went to bed I'd say

 ""Goodnight beautiful.""

""Goodnight guapo, see you in dreamland,"" he'd say


One night, about a month or maybe two in, he drank a bit too much and he blurted out that he was in love with me.  

As far as I was concerned, he was just drunk and he didn't mean it.  Being in love is a lot of pressure, after all.  So I calmed him down and took him home and tucked him into bed and fell asleep with him next to me.  I didn't say ""I love you,"" because I wasn't in love with him yet. 

He had his life to live and I had mine and maybe we'd spend a week without talking and when I got back to his house i spent about 20 minutes just kissing him.

""I didn't realize I missed you this much,"" he said. 
""I didn't either,"" I said

He met my friends eventually and I accidentally introduced him as my boyfriend. He was all panicked afterwards and asked me what I meant. 

 'Well we are, aren't we?'

I discovered more about his family and his friends, about who he was and who he wanted to be.  I slowly started piecing it all together and started to see what, exactly, I liked about him.  I realized that made me kinder, he made me more open to different ideas.  He made me calm.  He made sense. 

He wasn't perfect, though.  He wasn't the type of person I expected to find myself with.  

 I was taking a shower and weighing my options.  We were going into something serious and I wondered whether I should break it off or not.   ""Well I love him, of course, but..."" I thought.  

I love him.  Well, that was my answer.  So I told him.

She said ""the kitchen is a communal place, we should all have to clean it"" I said not no, but hell no to that...clean whatever you mess up after you're done eating = clean kitchen forever. 

Anyways long story short - roommate refused to clean up after herself in the kitchen...ended up paying me 75 dollars every few days to clean up the kitchen which worked out fine for me, I love free money for ~hour of cleaning or less."
considering most gays are in the closet that would make sense also if youre a mexican wrestler 
How's the therapy?
"Don’t know if this is your first test together. If he was negative before and positive now then you have your answer. Feel free to let him deal with the consequences on his own. 

But say he didn’t cheat. He still took a risk that you don’t have to take. Ask him how and when and with who. "
"A lot of bisexual guys with a preference for women find it easier to suppress the same-sex attraction than to face all the difficulties of coming out (even to themselves). And thus you get situations like this, where guys will insist they're straight... and yet..."
"Take him to a gun store and tell him he's the only holster your pistol will fit in. He's american, so the gun analogy and familiar setting will put him at ease."
"I have people I’m attracted to and not just like anyone else.  But the least attractive thing you can do is not be yourself. If you like shopping and appletinis you gotta own that shit. 

I’m obsessed with the outdoors and play video games and like my massive amounts of body hair. It’s me. I probably have limited my dating pool by doing so but it makes me happy and I think that’s attractive. "

"On our wedding day, after the ceremony, we took 5 minutes back in our room to take in what just happened. It was really nice as the rest was a blur! "
Bi?
He looks much older than he is.
I'm 24 and I've never had a boyfriend. It's gross to use something like this to judge yourself or measure your worth.
"That's easy. Ask him out. Even if he's straight, it seems like he wants you as a friend. So you have nothing to lose. But if he's smiling that much every time he sees you, then maybe he's gay and he likes you (especially if he's a good cook and wants to ""experiment""). As I said, you have nothing to lose"
"""Also, I can show you my Roth IRA, and along with my taxable accounts, I save at least 30% of my income.""   
If someone said this to me during a the first few dates I would fall in love instantly."
That's what boyfriends are for.
It's almost as if sexual assault is underreported and victims are often shamed out of doing so by disgusting comments like yours? What do you people think sexual assault is?
"They probably aren't busy a lot of the time they say they are, they are flaking you. If you have used apps a while you'll know that gay men are extremely flaky. 

Some tips would be to stop making plans in advance. People become less interested for all sorts of reasons you'll never know. If you are trying to meet people on apps then try and meet them that day when they are online also looking to meet people. 

If you have met them in person and you have made a connection it's a bit different. Sure, make plans in advance and try to find times that work out for both of you. If they are still ALWAYS busy and you can never pin them down then you already know the answer. They aren't that interested and even if they are, they aren't in a place in their lives right now where they can dedicate time to socialising with new people. 

As someone who currently has to say I'm busy all the time I'm usually the one that is hard to pin down and let me just say it's nothing to do with them it's all about my own shit to deal with. Never take it that personally. You're probably just getting a bit unlucky. Keep trying it's all a numbers game tbh."
"""Me too thanks"""
"This vote was pointless and we should take it with a gain of salt. It's non-binding and they already said that if it the majority came back yes, they would disregard it. And if it came back no they would use it as an excuse to postpone it again. All it did was waste tax dollars and cause civil war between the yes and no campaigners."
"Gay face does exist. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is but usually you can see it in someones smile. 

That being said for some odd reason its an insane hot button and people will get super angry if you mention it. Do all gay guys have it? No, but many do. "

"Let’s be honest, your husband being decidedly effeminate is probably the only reason accepts your relationship."
"Obama supported gay marriage as early as 1996.  Then, when he started to get involved in national politics, his position shifted to supporting civil unions and repealing DOMA.  While he was technically against gay marriage in 2008, it was not at all similar to how Republicans were against gay marriage.  Obama supported civil unions and repealing DOMA and he was against any attempts to ban gay marriage.  Republicans were against civil unions, in favor of DOMA, and were attempting to ban gay marriage.  Even if we took him at his word that he was against gay marriage, his position was far superior to the alternative.  But the way I felt (and I suspect a lot of others did too) is that Obama was just claiming to be against gay marriage since gay marriage was still pretty unpopular at the time and he didn't want to make that a big part of the campaign.  He was an early supporter of gay marriage in the 90s, so it seems unlikely he actually turned against it - he was just trying to get elected. I had no problem with that - it was just the reality of how politics works.  His actual position on laws for gay marriage were always in favor of gay rights - he just claimed to personally be against gay marriage to make it less of an issue when running for president.

That's basically how it was for all Democrats at the federal level at the time.  Being vocally in favor of gay marriage would have prevented them from getting elected.  So, they supported gay rights as much as they could while still getting into office.  Yeah, it's a bit cynical and it's playing politics, but it's far better than supporting someone who would actively worked against gay rights."
Be careful about letting homophobic people in your inner circle?

"i've been groped too many times to count by both straight women, and gay men.  and i can't take it seriously.  I have never felt in danger, or offended or traumatized by it at all.  it's more traumatizing than being forced to kiss my grandpa on the cheek when i was a kid.

I think some people really just like playing a victim and making a meal deal out of it.  But if you wanna play the groped game,  i have plenty of stories."

"There is no one way to be gay. You don't have to like certain music, or speak a certain way, or have a certain religious view, or political view.....we are all different. All being a gay guy means is that you are a man who loves men. 

So don't live your life following what you think a gay man should be, or listen to what others tell you a gay man should do. Just live your life however you want, being gay doesn't define you. "
The real reason to do this.

"I flirted with a guy for months, and he flirted back. Meanwhile, the most I knew was that he had a crush on a very beautiful girl at school. But we talked about our cocks (being high schoolers).

Eventually ended up losing my virginity and gay kiss virginity to him. "
If I wasn't gay I would convert myself. Men are just too beautiful not to love them.

"My brother tells everyone that I'm the most mature person he's ever met. You have to take into consideration that most of his friends are pretty much stuck in gay adolescence and that he also tells them (when they ask about my sexuality) that I'm straight but ''so open minded'' (cause I'm not out to him). But I guess that's nice? 

Also, my boss tells everyone that I'm basically the best thing since sliced bread but he **also** tells me that to my face so does that count? ~~I'm super unprofessional idk what he's talking about~~"

"Or maybe try to enrich your mind by starting to acknowledge that your preference didn’t just arise in a vacuum. It’s not inscribed in your genes like your sexuality is. Sure. The hypocrisy goes both ways but the first step to fixing anything is to acknowledge that it exists and at least, emphasis, realize the possibility rather than vehemently shutting it down.  I don’t tolerate hypocrisies from POC of anyone either but your post aims to shut people from  speaking up. Not all races have equal power in shaping general preferences. You’re not on the short end of course you don’t give a shit. "

"Overheard my friend and his fiance talking once. I got to the house a little earlier than I said I would. I knocked a few times, but no one answered. They usually leave the door unlocked when they're expecting someone, so I went on in. I stopped walking through the house when I heard them talking and my name come up.

Overheard his fiance say about me ""he's always polite and will do anything for you, but Jesus he swears too much!""

And then my friend said that I just look at swear words like they're any other word, which is true.

Nice to hear I'm polite and reliable though."
"I find the concept hilarious, because (correct me if i'm wrong) they use names of real affluent/prominent Mormon elders, which probably really pisses off real  conservative mormons.

The lighter skin tone is something obsessed over by the fashion + movie industry and hopefully is something that changes because the average Indian isn't as light-skinned. And yeah there are definitely very hot dark guys.

I agree. But I see it having deep long lasting affects on gay men a lot more.

"That's actually really interesting. I know that straight guys on Tinder often just match everyone and then will select people based on who matches back, but it is interesting a lot of ""straight"" guys seemed interested in something sexual."
"There was also the time a boyfriend left anal beads out then had friends come over.

And I once visited a friend's apartment, saw a g-string on the couch, kept walking to the window and said how much I admired the view. I gave him precious seconds before I turned around. The g-string was gone but he was standing with his hands behind his back. As I walked back, away from the window I said ""I saw the g-string"" to which he said the best ""oh god damn it!"" 

It was mild and funny enough to not maintain polite ignorance about it, but at least I have him a precious twenty seconds in which he thought he got away with it. ;p"
"A lot of younger gay people don't know what Matthew Shepard times were like...which is good, because at least we know things changed for the better. He was murdered in the 90s but it was only during Obama's presidency that the Matthew Sheppard act got passed. "

"1. Cologne is no substitute for showering.
2. Brush and floss at least twice daily. An amazing number of health conditions are influenced by oral health and hygiene. 
3. Save money wherever you can, as often as you can. Having a 401k is indeed sexy.
4. Life doesn't end at 25. Most people don't get interesting until age 30 or later. 
5. Vote, speak out, volunteer, and defend your rights before someone takes them away.
6. Be kind to your queer peers who are different. There's room on that flag for every color of the rainbow.
7. Property is the best investment you could make, but don't be a landlord. Buy REIT's and spare yourself the drama.
8. You don't need someone else's approval to want things, or fuck people, or find certain things sexy. It's your life.
9. You don't need a partner to complete you or give you purpose in life. A healthy couple is two wholes, not two halves.
10. Follow your heart and be a moderate hedonist. It's more fun to regret a colorful life than to regret a boring one."

"At dinner, my best friend asked him what he likes about me. He gave out very generic answers like ""he is nice, hardworking blah blah blah""

On the way back to our hostel, in a taxi, he said that question makes him realised how incredible I am and how lucky he is to have me and he started crying.

Me, being a stoic person whenever someone cries said ""can we do this at the hostel, the taxi driver is looking at us"" 

I definitely ruined the mood and he laughed after I said that. It has become a running joke between us and whenever he gets emotional, I asked him if he's going to bawl his eyes out. "
In the context of this post that's such a perfect bar 
What’s your question? Whether you should be concerned about getting it from him? Or whether he got it from cheating? 
"&gt; Gay guys don't get to use ""oh but I'm still in the closet!!!"" as an excuse for shitty behavior.
