Hahah nah man you on your own with that one. 
I'm black so I have an ongoing fantasy of being used by a plantation owners daughter that owns me and calls me nigger.I think if there is an afterlife my ancestors are looking down on me with an extreme amount of shame.

Yeah sometimes when I'm jacking off I think of girls littering. It's so morally wrong but I like a girl who breaks the rules 
I enjoy a nice glass of ice water from time to time.
Maybe she just wants to see you bend the knee
Is your wife single?
What you said is waaaaaay more awkward than buying condoms. What uncle sends his nephew into the store to buy condoms for him?
"I once had an anal fistula, basically like a boil beside the butthole which will never heal, that will leak fluid (sometimes blood if you scratch it or wipe too hard)

I spent a few years with a tissue wedged in there (graduated to a band-aid and surgical mesh when it got worse)

Eventually saw a doctor, it was diagnosed and surgically removed.

I'm pretty sure this is what your friend is going through. "
"Anything standing - partner's significantly shorter, so I have to bend my knees quite a bit and it kills my thighs."
I'm not ready for marriage 
"Yup, that's going to take a *long* time to wash out."
"Hey, lady checking in here and she's not being cool. I recommend asking her what she likes to do to 'recharge', and maybe use that word too - recharge sounds like more of a necessity than a preference (even though it can be that too).

If she likes chatting and talking about her day, then say ""just like you enjoy processing your day with a conversation, I like processing mine by giving my brain and social side a rest"".

Then when you get home, have a short chat, then go play your games or read or whatever.

Or whatever :) hope it gets resolved  

Edit: also maybe explain how you feel when you don't get that 'recharge' alone time. Do you get stressed? Do you check out totally? Does it make you lazy and less likely to want to do anything? Do you get snappy and miserable? I dunno just have a little think, take like 5 minutes to really think and check in with yourself and your brain. Take care of yourself, if you're in bad shape you can't be effective at taking care of others"
"Women are just as bad as men in every way.  For every misogynistic controlling tool there's a woman who think men must be ""trained"".  For every ""nice guy"" there's a woman that men ""can't handle"".  We're all people and a lot of people are shitty. "
Plow me like you plow the fields!
"Idk if I'll get flak for this but here goes nothing.

I grew up an awkward kid. From when puberty started to my senior year of HS, I saw women as a ""sex object"". That's not the right word I'm looking for but it's the best one I could find. I saw them as a goal, something you chase after and woo so you can get laid. As you might expect, I didn't have any luck with girls. 

Once college hit, something changed. I don't know what it was. Maybe I got jaded after being rejected so many times, maybe I grew up a little bit. But once I realized that women are people, people with the same thoughts and feelings as me, it changed everything. It's incredibly simple if you think about it. Whether it was in class or at a party, I would just strike up a conversation with a girl. See how things go. You can tell pretty quickly if they're interested or not. Changed my whole dating life.

Been with my SO for about two years now. This feels really gross to type, but I'm glad I've come this far. 

TLDR: Women aren't sex objects, theyre people. Treat them like you would anybody on this earth."
"Let's lock the thread up now, you've won. "
"Wash your sheets, towels and pillow cases regularly. You'd be shocked how many people don't do this."
"69 with me on top.  Its all the workout of a plank, with added thrusting and neck contortion to bury my face in the pussy.  But my wife loves a cock forced into her mouth as she comes, and frankly I could use the shoulder workout...So let's party!"
"I did one little spin and my girl got scared,

And said ""I'm leaving you because you do this shit in mid-air."""
"I fantasise about all of my close attractive female friends and if the opportunity came up, I'd smash in a heartbeat.

Could just be me but who knows "
"Looks are important, anyone who denies it is an idiot, however it's your personality; hobbies; confidence etc. that will keep you together in the long run. All those can make up for your looks, however this only works to an extent. Good personalities, confidence and being interesting won't help if you're 300 lbs and don't shower. "
"Food. I love eating out at restaurants, "
"All my girlfriends have told me something along the lines of, ""I love your brain!""


I'm guessing this means I'm ugly af"
"No, you are apart of it. You're not a part of it however  "
"Some of my students are very hot. But as a teacher that's a line I should not cross, being a professional and all that, even if they are of legal age. But yeah, the forbidden aspect of it makes the fantasy even hotter."
"ok, I get it. you have a beard because it makes you feel more manly or something.

shave your fucking neck. it looks sharp."
"Ah yes, that had to be the time i found out my partner and mother of my 4 children was having an affair and after finding out she was pregnant by my friend i ""rationalised"" that I'd be tied to him through our blood related children and offered what i guess you could call a truce? But I'm actually i told him he was effectively family and I'd help him if needed. Fast forward a couple weeks and his disgruntled ex caused him to be homeless. 

My solution? Offer for him to stay with us until he got himself in his feet.

He didn't have a phone as it was held by the police after his ex attached him and my partner with a samurai sword when she caught them together. So... I got him a phone on my contract. A blackberry i think. Of course he didn't like it because he'd had an iPhone so i returned it and paid more to get an iPhone instead.

I chose to ignore the fact they would stay in the kitchen talking all day in favour of looking after my kids and attempted to ignore them sitting *really* close on the sofa when the kids went to bed.

Looking back i have that **wtf** moment. I know why i did it. I know where my head was at and my reasoning i told myself. But it's still surreal to think on it.

Edit: words"
"Here I am feeling embarrassed because I waved to a girl I thought was waving to me, not the guy behind me but your story made me feel better haha. Don't sweat over it though - what's done is done. GL "
Your dick will look a lot bigger without a bush ;)
"Women were bad luck at sea. Turns out, my wife is quite the sailor. "
"Went to our favorite national park. Walked on our favorite trail. Waited until we where alone and got down on one knee. And said ""Will you marry me? If you say no you'll have to get home on your own.""... She said yes. "
"* Dab the warm spots with cologne. Behind your ears, wrists, etc.

* Cut your fucking finger and toe nails. 

* Wash your asshole if the shit you took required half a roll of toilet paper.

* Get some powder for your dick, balls, and ass. When it's hot out those areas get funky as fuck.

* [Old Spice Classic.](https://oldspice.com/en/content/original-classic-solid-deodorant)

* Take a shower before you go out in public for extended periods of time. 

* Wash and condition your hair. Just cause you got a dick doesn't mean your hair has to be unhealthy and look like shit. 

* Fix your fucking dandruff problem if you have one."
Cowgirl when she gets lazy and I have to start thrusting from the bottom
Nothing. She just liked me best because we had better personality chemistry.
"Her facial expressions really sell this gif. She seems to be thinking ""really?""."
"My husband had this and it was. The best part is having to pack the surgery site with gauze in case the surgeon wants to ""leave it open to heal.""  This requires a shower every time you poo. And also having your wife pack your ass with gauze.

He has done equally gross things for me after a surgery, I should add. "
That sounds like hell on earth
"&gt; Asks for a sign


&gt; Girl suggests you kiss her


&gt; *Better keep looking for signs*  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I remember those days too haha"
"Fancy whiskey/beer, meat, watches, shoes, and travel."
"manpons
Similar to the feminine tampon, the masculine 'manpon' is used for the reduction of sweat between the cheeks of the buttocks, placed firmly between the cheeks in times of high pressure, stress, or sweat-causing situations

THIS. IS. REAL. "
"I don't even remember her before I started liking her. Like as in she was in my friend group and I didn't notice her at all. I think it was literally the moment I hit puberty and I just saw her and I was blown away. She was beautiful to me. 

Instantly crushed on her. We even got really close and at one point we were joking around and she pretended to be dead and jokingly said if she didn't wake up I'd kiss her and she just smiled at that moment, eyes closed. I didn't go for it.

I literally remember reading horoscopes, praying, weird shit that I'd get a sign that she likes me. God 10 year olds are stupid. "
"Sit down, explain what an introvert is, maybe watch some videos about it together. Communicate.

"I told my ex husband about my extremely embarrassing kinks that I swore to never tell anyone. We split up and I'm positive that he's drunkenly (or soberly) told all his friends in an attempt to make me look crazy. So I regret that, severely. It's made me not want to tell my completely understanding and open-minded boyfriend. 

Edit: I talked to him about it and while he's (sadly) not into it, he was surprisingly chill about it."
"Ok, so you know mind control? Like when you hypnotize a girl so that she fucks you? Yeah, that, only that she is aware of what her body is doing, doesn't want to do it, but her body is out of her control, a la Ella Enchanted. (Un)Surprisingly enough, that movie was a key part of my puberty. "
Pub sure. I couldn't imagine going to a club alone.
"I started planning for a surprise beach proposal on our July trip the January/Feb before. Since it was on the other side of the country, I had her retired parents and our friends on the coast help coordinate. 

In the spring, her parents helped scope out a good spot, and I got everyone in on a plan to surprise her. Then in July we all arrived at the beach house for our usual summer vacay.

 We had props (tall hooks holding stained glass lanterns, and yellow paper lamps (her favorite color), so her brother in law and I decided to misdirect her while we got setup. He told her that her sister was sad no one could make it to her bday and they were going to get cupcakes to surprise her. In the meantime, we all headed down to the beach (a friend was a videographer so that helped). 

Her parents also hung back to walk with her slowly to the spot. 

We set up on the bottom of a stairway entrance where she couldn't see us but her tall father could be seen by us at the bottom. Her brother in law had ran ahead because we were ""playing football"" and needed an extra person. Finally, her parents and her started heading our way and when we saw her dad's head it was our signal. 

We had a Bluetooth speaker playing a Sigur Ros song (her fav band) and our friends were lining the sides of a path along the beach holding the paper lanterns. I was at the end between the stained glass lanterns.

When she walked around the corner and saw all of us standing there obviously waiting for her, she dropped to the ground covering her mouth in shock. Immediately crying and too excited to speak. She hugged her parents and walked towards me, both of us were crying like crazy, I got on one knee and told her she was my best friend and then asked her if she would also be my wife. She said yes, everyone cried a lot, and a group of people/strangers that had amassed behind us started clapping and cheering. 

Good times. "
"Girl i used to date was into the whole rape play. She would want me to pin her down by her throat and pound the living daylights out of her, and shove my dick down her throat until there were tears in her eyes. Her request, not mine.

I wasn't really into it but it got her off like nothing else, watching her enjoy it so much, in turn, got me off.

I'm not into that kinda stuff but I'm into watching chicks get off. So I digged it. "
"They may be better looking, but I'm probably smarter,

If not, I'm probably more talented,

If not, I'm probably more successful,

If not, I'm probably more interesting,

If still not, then wow I'm surrounded by pretty impressive people I could learn a lot from, and if we're hanging around together odds are someone thinks I'm on their level."
"Translation:
""Looks get you in the room; personality keeps you in there."" 

Which is more important then? I would argue getting in the room in the first place."
"A lot. Like, anyone who is even kinda attractive probably gets some fantasy time. They are largely just fantasy tho. There are plenty of lady friends that I have fantasized about boning, but few I would actually ever consider dating if I was single. "
"I think the preoccupation with sex, and relationships in general, is really weird, whether you're having it or not getting any. I get that it's a biological, instinctual urge, but our brains are filled with information and experiences and it seems like 90% of the content in this sub pertains to something sex/dating related. I probably have a much lower sex drive, but I love the threads about normal dude shit like drinking beer or video games or crazy life stories. 

I also really dislike a lot of the unwillingness to be able to speak about topics in depth. A lot of people will just crack a joke or give a one sentence answer when there is so much that can be explored with conversation. It happens in real life and in other places of Reddit, but I just don't see the point of it bothering to explain and go into depth about your thoughts on something."
"Just used my sign-on bonus to upgrade my Gaming PC. 

Extra glorious now "
"Because being short *is* a disadvantage. Obviously you can compensate for it, as you have since you're handsome and fit, but in general, short is seen as less attractive than tall by most women. I disagree with the doom and gloom that short people on reddit like to peddle, but it's naive to think their doom and gloom is purely in their heads. It's an unfortunate response to an accurate assessment. The proper response is to do what it takes to improve your attractiveness, like getting fit, not lying down and dying. If a lot of girls aren't into short guys, they're even less into Debbie Downers that just give up."
"Shell out the money (+$25 not including tip) and get a good haircut.


It makes the maintenance process so much easier (there was a guy I knew who would go through an $18 thing of American Crew pomade a month to get his $10 haircut to look the way he wanted) and often will be cut in a way to account for things you haven't thought of.  For example, a good stylist will factor in the shape of your head and the shape of your face when cutting your hair....this makes a surprising difference.  They'll also be able to cut your hair in a way so that it not only looks good right afterwards, but will grow out nicely as well.


It's definitely money well spent in my opinion."
God dammit is this another one of those secret clubs I'm not apart of? 
"Let me kick you a scenario. I'm, like, at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches, tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, I might give in a little bit, just to see what it felt like. "
Because of the implication. 
"Newsflash, cashiers don't give a shit what you're buying. They're stuck behind a register doing a mundane activity and just want to get through their shift as smoothly as possible. They've ran up so many packs of condoms they stopped noticing, even the people who buy condoms with bananas and lube.

I'm not proud of this but my senior year in college I didn't wash my sheets once.
"Honestly, straight up missionary where I'm on top, basically planking up and down for an extended amount of time is one of my least favorites. "

"""Thats so cute i had to punch a wall to gain my manliness back""

"I can relate actually. A few months ago I was a groomsman at my buddy's wedding. I was committed to making sure he had fun the whole night so I was getting the fuck down on the dancefloor for *hours*. Eventually this super cute chick with the thiccness and this super short skirt started grinding on me. We went full highschool-dance grindstyle for a good 45 seconds. Eventually we dance away from each other and the groom comes up to me and says ""Dude she's married with two kids and her husband is right outside (in plain view)."" 

I was like ohhh fuck! Looking back on it I wonder if it was some hotwife scenario I wasn't aware of."

"I took her to one of my favorite easy hiking spots. Problem was that the area had been affected by a forest fire a year prior so all my usual landmarks were gone. Wandered around a bit lost and found our way back to the car, and once we found a decent spot overlooking the town I popped down on one knee. 

The day before I had gone to get the ring; I had a fairly limited budget and was surprised to find what I considered the perfect ring, made by a local jeweler almost exactly at the top of my budget (and seemed like waaaay too good of a deal). Asked if I could swap the center gemstone for one of my favorites that means quite a bit to me (Montana Yogo sapphire) and the salesman said he'd do it for no extra charge. I came back to pick it up a couple hours later to see the salesman getting shouted at by a tall man in a suit; the suit man came barging up to me red in the face and asked if I was there to pick up the ring the salesman had just sold. I said yes and provided my receipt, to which the suit man shouted ""WELL CONGRATULATIONS SON, YOU JUST STOLE THAT FUCKING THING"" and stormed off. Turns out the shorty suit man was the owner of the store, and they were in the process of repricing their inventory when I had come in - the salesman (his son) had left off a digit in the price in the process and I bought it before the error was discovered. So I managed to buy a $7,250 engagement ring for $725. "
"Become a regular at a pub/bar. Then you can drink alone and you will still have friends there.  If you are friendly with the staff they will be friendly back. When you are alone and the staff is all talking to you and paying attention to you girls at the bar will notice this and no longer consider you to be alone. 

I used to frequent a bar near my condo and I would get picked up by the waitresses and bartenders, usually when they finish working and the bar is still open because they know me and come sit beside me at the bar for a drink after their shift. "

They have insecurities about relationships with men. 
"Not married yet, but still engaged. I proposed on our third anniversary date. We did a déjà vu by eating at the same restaurant and walking in the same park where we went on our first date. We even walked on almost exactly the same paths. Eventually, she said how nice it felt to relive our first date. At that point, I talked about how I never got bored doing things with her, even if they were done before, because I was always happy to be around her. I then got down on one knee and asked her the all-important question. She put her hand on her heart and was speechless, showing an ""Oh my god!"" reaction, then enthusiastically answered ""yes"", and passionately kissed me.

As we were driving back, she said she knew I would propose, as she saw that my pocket was wider than usual and that I must have been keeping the box containing the ring. She guessed correctly."

I came into her life at just the right time, as someone safe to dip her toes back into the dating pool.  We turned out to be extremely compatible, emotionally, physically, in terms of our upbringing and religion, and it very easily and comfortably became a serious relationship. 

I've heard ""what the hell is she doing with *him*"" more than once over the years.  Others have assumed she's a trophy wife when they first see us together.  I don't really care what people say or think- she's been the love of my life for two decades. "

My plan was to get her a fourth so she could have another heart (wink, wink) and then ask her to marry me.

In early December I managed to get a heart piece key chain and the ring (with the Kokiri emerald).  Unfortunately she manages a chocolate shop that does around $2 million in sales in December and I didn't want to stress her out extra (even if it was for something good), so I decided to wait until January.

I was itching to pop the question so I decided to do it at breakfast on New Year's Day (we were already living together).  

So we woke up lat the next day and as we're laying in bed cuddling she looks at me and says

""Will you marry me""

I stayed silent because I wasn't sure if she was actually asking or just being romantic and lovey, but then

""Seriously, I'm asking for real, will you marry me""

So I told her to hang on for a second and ran to the closet to grab the ring and keychain from were I'd stashed them.

I guess this is technically not the story of me proposing but damnit she only beat me by two hours "

"So this is the only time I'm ever gonna tell this to you all on Reddit. Ever. 

My husband was raped by his mom for about four years as a kid. It is the worst case of child sexual abuse I have heard of first-person, aside from one friend whose dad is gonna die in prison for that. But this situation my husband experienced was just as bad. 

I am, to be clear, not attracted to children. And he, to be clear, knows what happened was fucked up, warped, wrong. 

But, regardless, she shaped much of his sexuality. And he still remembers the physical pleasure very clearly even though he also remembers the humiliation and shock and dissociation very clearly. So we reenact those things sometimes. 

I think it helps him replace the bad memories with good ones. He knows that he can always tell me no. 

I had a difficult time, though, accepting mentally that such reenactments turn me on too. I feel like I want to vomit whenever I learn a new thing this sociopath did, so how is it that I can fake being like her and have fun? It caused me significant emotional pain, and I wondered if I might be evil like her. 

He doesn't know I ever felt such pain about it. He isn't my therapist, and shouldn't be. But yeah. "

It doesn't. Enjoy it (responsibly).
"Accepting responsibility for one's own actions and not trying to blame everything or everyone else. When a lot of shit is constantly going wrong in a lot of areas, look for a common denominator (yourself)

Accepting criticism and using it to better yourself

Setting goals and actively pursuing them

Comfortable with self. You aren't constantly comparing yourself to everyone and trying to find a way to best them. Recognizing your own worth and going with it.

Not having emotion be the ruler of all decisions or responses to situations. 

Being humble. You don't need to brag or boast about things. There is a fine line between being proud of accomplishments and being a cocky douche

Constantly trying to better yourself in some way. 

Not belittling others or seeking ways to make others feel like shit

Not being spiteful towards people. Recognize that people's actions are generally reflective of themselves and not you. 

Not constantly victimizing yourself when something doesn't go your way and looking for sympathy anywhere you can get it.

"As an introvert, finding a relationship like this was eye opening.

"Instead of asking him to change, it might help to start with simply expressing your feelings. ""When you do ___, I feel ___.""

"To me, it is:

- Use a proper face wash and moisturiser. Keep your facial skin in good condition with those two products.
- Shower in the morning
- Use decent shampoo and conditioner
- Unsightly hair somewhere? There's nothing wussy about getting your back waxed.
- Does your head hair make you look like some bastard child of pikachu and a dildo? Then go get it sorted. You don't need a boutique haircut, any decent barber on the high street will sort you out.
- If you're doing facial hair, google your face shape, find celebs with that face shape and see what they're doing. Don't be afraid to experiment
- It is actually OK to trim your pubic hair. No girl wants to dig through a sweaty enchanted forest to get to your dick. Not too short mind! Girls don't want a 12 year old boy penis either!
- Use deoderant. While you're at it, invest in a decent cologne. Go to the shop, have a sniff, actually pick one that smells nice. Weirdly the women who work in those stores are fantastic at pointing you in the right direction and don't be afraid to actually spend the money on a decent one. The cheap ones smell like cat piss after an hour or two.
- Decent wardrobe. The biggest tip on a budget? If your trousers are decent and actually cost some cash, you can get away with a cheaper top for every day use. Also, keep a decent suit somewhere in your wardrobe. 
- Gym. You want to look amazing? Hit the gym.
- Don't look the same way within 9 months or so. What do I mean? If you look at a photo of yourself 9 months ago and you look the same, you're not evolving. Change it up. Try a different hair style, buy new clothes, shave the beard and give it a try. I change up quite a bit, my girl likes it.

Hope that helps"

"That every time any women's rights stuff comes up, there will be a bunch of people posting about hard it is to be a man because we don't get to have emotions or be expressive, or whatever.

I'm happy with my dating life as well, but it's massively irritating.

Women draw a correlation to men not being interested in women who are large/fat/obese, which is fair, except someone can change their waistline. Note I'm not saying they *should*, and I'm certainly not saying it's easy, but it's at least within the realm of things that are possible to do. No amount of exercise, dieting, changing my lifestyle, **or even expensive surgery** is going to make me taller than the 5'7"" I am now."

"Oh my god, there are so many things, it'd be hard to pick just one.

I definitely agree with you about guys whining about all of the things that are ""required"" for men to date or sleep with women.  Pretty much anyone can scroll through their facebook friends list and see tons of really average guys in happy relationships.

The people who complain about all of the high ""requirements"" that woman have for dating also seem to be the same people who complain about women dating ""broke assholes without a job or college degree.""  Are women's standards too high or too low?  You need to make up your mind.

I get that a lot of guys in real life have sex.  I'm even one of them.  I don't get how many guys seem to need to brag about how good they are at sex, as though there are women who are going to read their post and want to fuck them.  Pretty much every guy on reddit who says he has ever had sex claims that he loves going down on women more than he loves breathing and that she always has 10 orgasms in a row before he even thinks about doing anything to get off himself.

I'm also not a huge fan of the anti-sports /r/ihatesportsball circlejerk that we see on here a lot.  Obviously there are sports subreddits that love sports, but most of the default subs are filled with guys talking about how they're too smart for sports or whatever.  There are tons of things that I don't like.  When people make posts about videogames, I don't click on them just to comment about how I don't play videogames.  If you don't like something, it seems easier to just not talk about it.

It's not just the guys of reddit, but it seems to be more the guys than the girls, but I'm not a huge fan of the whole STEM circlejerk.  It's cool to study whatever you want, but that doesn't make you better than anything else.  I've seen so many post by guys saying ""well I'm in STEM, I'm way too busy and have too many important things to do than to chase women, so what's the one easy trick to get someone to touch my penis?"" as though other people don't also have things that they care about that take up their time."
"That women share some common, collective brain which can somehow be hacked in order to coerce them into doing your sexual bidding. 

There's no ""what women want, what women like, etc."" Each one is unique and has her own personality and preferences. Imagine that!

Also, the friendzone is a myth."

It looks fine right after but it looks best once it has grown a little.  The super cuts $9.99 haircut chains cut your hair for right now and it looks silly in a week when it grows uneven.

Also, side note **find a barber you like and stick with them**.

They will learn your head shape, what you like, what you don't, what worked last time, how your cowlicks work, how fast your hair grows, etc.  A good barber will take of these things into account and give you a quality cut."
"A fistula is actually not a boil, but a canal leading from inside your butthole, to outside.  It WAS an infection, but that blew out and created the ""tunnel"" from in to out.  So now it's basically like you have two buttholes.  Since it gets irritated every single time you shit, not to mention packed with shit, it remains irritated and most of the time must be surgically removed (closed at both ends).   Since it has no sphincter, it just leaks shit all the time.

Edit: Apparently this really bothers people.  I find that entertaining.

"It means he's a Western European who isn't Germanic or Norse or descended from such.

Back before Italians existed and their ancestors, the Romans and Latins and Etruscans and such were the ones living in central, southern, and northeastern Italy, there was this whole big culture of people stretching from Ireland in the NW to parts of the Iberian Peninsula(modern day Spain+Portgual) and even including a tiny enclave over in Anatolia(modern day Turkey), but for our purposes it's mainly the dudes who lived in what are now France and Northwestern Italy, which were the Gaulish portion of the ethnic-cultural group.

I also learned not to compromise myself in a situation. I love collaboration, but compromising what I want in a relationship isn't actually getting a great match, I don't settle anymore, and it's resulted in a long string of happy, friendly, sexually charged relationships. (Most end due to logistics or a person changing a lot, and that's okay!)

Finally I learned that I don't want a dependent. It's not me. I don't want to pay for you, drive you everywhere, be your therapist, etc. If I wanted a dependent I'd have a child. I don't want one. This is not to say I won't provide support and help, but it must be earned and appreciated and reciprocated, it's not something another is entitled to."

"So racial fetishization is a concept that I've recently been exposed to. ""Submissive Asian Girl"" is literally the #1 fetishized group right now, and I'll do my best to explain why people (mostly women who may or may not fit ""your type"") would bristle at your description of what you see as your type.

And this isn't to demean your preferences, just explain people's response to it. So you seem attracted to a stereotype, and that puts people off because you seem to base your rather exclusionary attraction on the meme of the submissive Asian woman. Any Asian you would find attractive you find attractive because of what group they belong to first, not them as an individual. I talked about this with my Latina/Asian-American friend last night, and we were talking about my fetish for thicc Latina girls, and she said that it kind of strips them of their individuality when you quantify their attractiveness in regards to what race they are.

I certainly didn't get it before and thought ""preferences are preferences yo,"" but now talking to them about it, I get it. They would rather you think ""I like this person, and they happen to be attractive"" than ""I really like this person physically, which is my primary interest in them, because they fit my stereotypical mold.""

There's an infinitely shifting line on ""what is shallow"" and ""what is normal attraction"" which is down to personal interpretation, but I wanted to share why your description of your type would put people off, because it definitely sounds like a racial fetish. Hope this is some food for thought."

Luckily that motherfucker never went all the way through.  Though it did leave my butthole with an unpleasant scarring.  It was a big...deep zit.  I got it from wiping so much I bled when I had horrific diarrhea after learning the lesson that you never eat day old sushi."

"Playing outdoors or just exploring the neighborhood with other people around the neighborhood. Most of us became friends only bc of our homes' proximity to each other. 



Calling friends and family up regularly. 



Not checking social media and email every couple hours. I spent more time away from screens.



Being content with boredom. With YouTube and unlimited access to Internet, I feel like I can't sit somewhere without having anything to do. It makes me feel...foreign.



I miss feeling amazed sometimes. If I saw a dude juggling or something on the street, I'll immediately compare him with a YouTube vid of some legendary juggler and it sometimes diminishes the ""coolness"" factor of whatever I'm physically witnessing.

"Eh, I have to disagree. Looks are still important from the get-go; even if you have shared activities.

Let's keep this room analogy going; all relationships people can have are now categorized as rooms, and all the corresponding people are placed in in. So there's a parent room, sibling room, friend room, acquaintance room, and so on so forth.

If you have a shared activity with an individual, you'll most likely be in the acquaintance room to start. You talk with them a bit, get closer to them, all that jazz, and you suddenly find a key that lets you out of your current room, and into the friend room. Follow me so far?

Now, of course, there is the S.O. room. It's empty of course. When you first enter the friend room, the key you used to get in stays with you. To unlock the door for the S.O. room, your key needs to fit and open it up. However, your key that you used to get into the friend room is the one you are stuck with; so you must somehow change the key, or you must somehow change the lock.

In this sense, changing the lock is equivalent to seeing how she sees you, and changing your key is changing yourself overall. Along with this, changing one may or may not have an effect on the other. 

So, say you catch feelings and really like (in this case) the girl. You would like it if you two could try dating or even become BF and GF. So, you start by changing yourself (as everyone on the internet recommends 😒); you work out, groom right, and that stuff. Funny enough, your key changes a bit; specifically, the bow and tip of your key changes. 

So you think you've improved yourself enough. You go ahead and try to unlock the door to the SO room; only, it won't open. Of course, you are shocked. You were told by everyone that if you improve yourself and you had a good personality, you can get any girl. But alas, you cannot.

So, you go about trying to change the lock. However, after trying to do so, you have found that it is nigh impossible to change the lock; thus, you try changing yourself again. This time, assuming that your personality was rubbish,  you try fixing your personality. The shoulder of the key changes, so you try once again. You fail again. You keep trying, over and over again. 

And you fail every time.

Until finally, you put the key in, and you can't pull it out. So, you are left with a dilemma: leave the key and give up on your trial, or try and turn the lock once and for all, even if it breaks your key. In real life, this dilemma is when you finally confess your feelings to her. And what does she say?

No... 

The key breaks. You've failed. The door leading into the friend room now opens. You have a choice: you can stay in the room, and hold onto the those feelings, conceal them, until they fade or you fade away, or you can leave the friend room. You foolishly decide to say, sealing your fate to be left as just a friend, unless another key somehow appears, or the door magically opens for you.

You sit down against the wall and try to think of what went wrong. You remember her telling you her preferences; you remember her telling you her celebrity crushes and their beautiful aesthetics; you remember her flirting back with you and laughing at her jokes. But most prominently of all, you remember the time in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.

"I had a girl try to tell me she was pregnant. Her end game I can't say I quite know, but to put it bluntly we had sex once, I used a condom, she tried to tell me the condom ""failed"" because magic.

I remained neutral and she talked it out with me. Well she was telling ME what was going to happen. E.g. start saving for a place to live etc. I didn't say no I just remained completely upbeat yet non-committal. 

I found her facebook and put up a thing on her page, just saying something innocuous but obvious that we were ""expecting"".

Cue a barrage of responses from her friends and family as to why she hadn't told them and when was this etc.

I got an angry text two hours later basically telling me I was a fucker and that it wasn't true and that I'd opened up a big problem for her with her family. I know the family and they know I'm not a nutter or someone who makes shit up like that. Her sister even texted me asking what was up, I was honest and just regailed what she had told me on the phone.

She disappeared for good. Dodged a bullet with that one. She was never pregnant at all.

As for what happens, then if she is pregnant, then there's not a lot you can do. While it should be your decision too as to what happens, it's not. That's not me being on the girl's side, it's simply the truth of the matter."
"Is she emotionally doing okay? I know you want the sexy girl you met initially, but consider any physical or mental health concerns first, because if there's something else wrong... you should approach this differently. If everything is fine and she just gained weight, you either deal with it until she decides to change on her own if ever or bring it up. Based on what you said, you don't sound as concerned about her health as you are with your attraction to her, but if you are concerned for her health, that could help address it. If not, think about your priorities in this relationship. If it doesn't match up, it might be time to break up. Be ready for fights though. A fight doesn't mean it won't work, but it's part of territory. It's her body at the end of the day.  You telling her what to do  about her own body in a vain society where a womans' self-worth is linked to her looks is a touchy subject. "
"I had a grudge against a guy that ran a convenience store in a small town my family came from for about 25 years. It wasn't much of a grudge.. it was more like, he was this big fat out of shape asshole and I made him mad one time when I was younger and he chased me around the town for a few hours in his truck. But the running joke in my family was always about how much him and I hated each other even though I hadn't seen him again since that day.  I had a family reunion there last summer and I said to my cousins later in the night that if someone showed me where he lived, I would go shit on his front step... Did not think they would actually take me to his house. So, there I was at about 3 am... pooping on his front step while my cousins sat and watched and laughed at me. When your older cousins call you out on something like that you have to go through with it though."
"Whatever makes her face look pretty without seeming out of place. This could be a lot of things, depending on the face or how good she is with makeup. Completely unnatural things like smokey/bronze eyelids can look really good. I'll see a woman and think wow, she has a pretty face, especially the eyes...oh duh she has sparkly powder on them, no wonder. It seems like the point of eye shadow and liner is to draw attention from the overall face towards they eyes, to keep someone from noticing imperfections on the rest of the face. Then it becomes easier for concealer, blush, or whatever to even out or contour the rest of the face. Nice hair works similarly, I'll hardly notice a woman's face if she has really pretty hair with a slight curl to it. That combined with a little bit of eye liner and eye shadow and she might as well be eyes and hair, cause that's all I notice."

"I was 16, in my parents basement. Giving my lass the gears from underneath, reverse missionary style.  Our bums were facing the door, I guess.

I can only imagine the trauma they experienced.

"This is, honestly, how I had like.... most of my one nights in college.  I get self-conscious flirting when I'm with people I know.  Found it very liberating to go out alone."
"One night, my friend and I went to this fancy club where only the older crowd goes. These are mostly single guys but who have very stable, high power jobs and it usually shows in their demeanor... But you also have the just-out-of-college types who are still figuring how dating  works and are pretending to be ballin' to get chicks. The contrast between one group and the other is noticeable from miles away. One example is this guy who bought me and my friend a super fancy table with a nice view of the night skyline, a super expensive wine and... You could just tell by the way he talked to me all he saw was a pair of legs and a possible fuck. Obviously, I got bored with him and after politely telling him I didn't think he was my type, he flipped, causing me to have to hide in the bathroom. By contrast this other guy, who had just been sitting at one of the tables drinking and who had seen me walk by multiple times in my attempts to hide from this guy, came up to me and we had a very nice conversation about something decidedly nonsexual. It felt like talking to someone while waiting at the grocery line; very polite, distant, but also amused. He made me laugh effortlessly, and I him. He wasn't particularly attractive but he made me feel like an actual human being; so if he had asked, I would have probably gone home with him. 

The truth is, women can see desperation and awkwardness from miles away, and it's usually kind of a turnoff. Treat them like human beings with a brain and interests, and don't put pressure on yourself to be this super interesting do-it-all macho Man or whatever.

Too awkward a memory. 

My parents weren't mad about the sex, they were mad that I was stupid enough to be caught by them, (and disrespectful enough to not consider/plan for that possibility).

Another time another ex and I were going at it and she's moaning ""fuck me Daddy fuck me fuck me Daddy oh God"" that kinda shit.

Just ask him if he would like to date you if you have feelings for him."
"This is because the best defense against STIs right now is a condom and condoms don't feel good.  When the object behind having casual sex is to feel good you can see why men make stupid choices.

She gets a boyfriend who MOVES IN and also does not work. They just get drunk together all day every day. He goes to jail for some shit, my uncle gets diagnosed with bone cancer. Can't work anymore and it's really doubtful that he will be alive much longer. Her bf gets out of jail and comes right back to living with them, and not only takes advantage of a dying man and the very little money he has left, but dictates how he gets to spend his days.

"I was guy A and my ex left me for guy B. She dated him for less than 2 months only to come back to me. I was an idiot and said sure. I believe that some people deserve second chances. She left me again for guy C and that didn't last long either. Came back to me, i said yes with conditions. She broke one of them and that was it. I didn't wait for her to leave me for guy D. I found out later that she was actually talking to few guys and from them rose guy D. At the end, guy D gave her the D and knocked her up. Now she is a single mom with no guy E to this day. Oh and did I mention that she asked to get together again. She claimed that it will be different this time. That she matured up and gotten smarter. Her life choices actually reflected that. But I just couldn't trust her anymore. I believed that if she ever meet guy E, then would she leave me again, for sure. 

She left me because she met someone else that had something that she wanted but I didn't. But when she saw the big picture, she realized what I had out weighted what I didn't have. Though she realized that too late. The grass will always look greener on the other side until you get there. Tsk. Tsk. "

Plus now I can write on Tinder 《6'8"" that's two measurements》"

"&gt;I learned that their social dynamics are far more complex

To my mind it's mostly extraneous useless complexity, it's more complex but at its core it's the same; playing nice with people you don't like much because you really ought to."
"Not what you asked, but here's some wisdom. 

Always eat ~~carbs~~ something before significant drinking will be involved. Drink water before, during, and after significant drinking. An aspirin will do wonders for headaches day after. 

Never mix bubbly/acidic drinks with hard liquor. A small glass of vodka dunked in a draught of beer can ruin you. Champagne is horrible because of this. Try and stick with the same type of drink all night. Goal of getting drunk is keeping in the ""tipsy/bubbly"" area as much as possible, avoiding throwing up, and the world spinning around you, in this order. Any drunk experience you can get somewhere to sleep it off without puking is a good outcome, however, you can quickly skip 'tipsy' and go into managing pre-puking which is no fun if you keep downing shots or 'frontload' a lot of drinking without letting it 'settle' in. If the world is spinning and you're having trouble, grab the edges of your bed with your hands outstretched and place the feet on the solid board of your bed if it has one, maximise number of sensing surfaces attachements will allow your brain to not freak out as much.

As a general night out, personally i like to go for a few hard shots and tip the line with glasses of wine or longdrinks. 

And if it needs saying, allow yourself to say no,no matter what anyone else wants you to do, or what you think is expected of you. I have thrown away good shots or spilt them back into an empty bottles if needed and wanting to keep up appearances. But outright refusing is a mature and fine thing to do.  

PS: The worst drinkers aren't alcoholics, the worst drinkers are corporate 9-5's that go out on a friday to 'wheee we have to go out and have fun and drink lots' and you end up cab-riding them home and even putting them in bed."
"Doctor said you're normal. That's all that matters. He sounds like a dick. You haven't had problems with other partners in the past, because they weren't dicks (at least not when it came to this). 

Over washing and/or putting extra stuff in or around your vagina is going to irritate it and possibly throw your pH balance off, as you know. 

Stop succumbing to his unrealistic demands. You have a clean/healthy smelling vagina."
"Not a turn off. Relax. Desperation is less about what you say and more about how you say it. Just be chill, smile, have fun. Then you just need to talk to me, ask me about myself, tell me about yourself, and then ask for my number and text or call me later and ask me out on an actual date. And that's just if I'm interested.

If I'm not interested, recognize it, and then graciously back off."
Seems like my fetish is women. 
"Moving. Seriously, it is a problem you can just throw money at and save yourself one fucking hell of a shitty time. 

Just pay the movers a few hundred dollars..in exchange, you don't have to carry those boxes out, load them onto a truck , drive a truck across town, unload them, carry them up the stairs and put them in the new place. On, and that applies to your furniture too. Movers, hands down. "

"I'll start off by saying she knew it was coming we talked about it and picked out a ring but I still wanted to surprise her a little so she had no idea when I would buy the ring and when I would propose. So she had a few ""requirements"" for the proposal, 3 to be exact. Ask her mothers permission (she doesn't have a father), use her middle name when I'm asking officially, and have someone take pictures of it. 

So I ask her mom for her blessing in the beginning of November and also ask her to keep it a secret. I then rented a hotel for the beginning of December in the heart of our city (we live in the burbs). My dad was state police and worked at the capital building which is directly across a state park from the judicial building which has spectacular lights for Christmas. So I ask my wife to accompany me on a date downtown. She is hardcore refusing to ""dress up"" cuz she knows I'm not gonna propose because I still haven't asked her mom. I buy a nice outfit so it forces her hand in dressing fancy, I knew she would regret it in the pictures if she didn't. 

We head downtown and on our way I got a call from my parents. Wouldn't you know it they locked their keys in their car at the capital and I have a spare. So we head to the capital it's about 630 in December so it's already dark where I live. We get there unlock his doors and since my dad works there he has keys to every door even tho the building is closed for the day. My mom so subtly suggests hey *my wife's name* do you want a real quick tour while we are here? My dad does an amazing job of rolling his eyes but agreeing. My wife excitedly agrees and we go in. 

We go up a few sets of windy staircases to the top where tours usually run through the day but my dad has keys so we can go past the public top and go to the tippy top. We wind our way up some more and my mom slides me the ring from her purse right next to her camera. We get to the top and my wife is immediately taken back by the view of the Christmas lights across the park. She pulls out her phone to take a picture my mom stands back camera ready while I get down on one knee behind my distracted wife. She turns around from taking a picture and there I am waiting I grab her hand call her by her full name give her the ring and ask her to marry me. Her range of emotion as went from surprised to happy/crying to anger at everyone who had tricked her. We then head of to our date at a nice restaurant and stay at a 5 star hotel for the night. It was a blast! 

The picture my mom got of her surprised reaction is still my favorite to this day. "
"You're willing to throw away a great thing, for another woman's pussy? 
Ruining what you've built for six fucking years, just to fuck for 10 minutes? 


Don't be stupid. "
