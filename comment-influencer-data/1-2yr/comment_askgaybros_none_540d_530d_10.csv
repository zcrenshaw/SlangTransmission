That's ok, you shouldn't date stupid people. "

"What I would suggest is to continue going to bars (or other social events). Stay for as long as you can. Don‚Äôt try to force yourself to socialize or anything. Just go in, have a drink or two, push yourself to the edge of your comfort zone and then leave when you feel you‚Äôve reached your limit. Keep doing this. Eventually you may find that it gets easier and easier. You may even find the courage to start socializing.

If you just avoid putting yourself into social environments your anxiety will simply be reinforced.

Also; be easy on yourself. You aren‚Äôt a failure. It was brave of you just to step out of your comfort zone in the first place. I would say that was a success in itself."
I think you underestimate the power of  homophobic parents' denial.
"&gt;""For example i'm with friends in coffee shops, with children nearby or in earshot, and friends are talking about 'mancunts' and 'cumdumps'""

Nope, not going anywhere near guys like that. It's not even about being prude, you can be straight/gay/pan/bi/etc but you don't say shit like that around children. Acting with decency is not that hard, some people just feel entitled to behave poorly and get praised for it. Get new friends."
I usually respond to Reddit posts and pretend that upvotes give my life meaning.
I think that beyond the fact that they were gay is that they were from a part of the world where gay folks are treated with hostility and yet still found each other. That‚Äôs inspiring to me. 
" I Believe it's 3-5% of people who identify as gay. There is no way to know exactly what percentage of men are *really* sexually or romantically interested in other males. I think there are plenty of guys who identify as straight but still would be down to have a sexual experience with another guy if they knew nobody would find out, they might be a little bi, or a lot bi but don't identify as it. I think sexuality is a spectrum not just black and white (gay or straight) everything in between and to varying degrees. Society just feels the need to put us in set boxes and that's just the way it is. I'd say its realistically more around 10% actually gay and 40% exclusively straight. The rest are somewhere in between but that's just merely my personal opinion. "
"Dude who described himself as a ""hot daddy"" and presented me with some very outdated photos to back it up. Turned out that he was an obese sixtysomething with a severe hygiene problem. It all really went south when (because, I think, I'd expressed a vague interest in rimming) he started indicating that he wanted to be rimmed. Which only revealed the full extent of the hygiene problem. I made as quick an exit as I possibly could, and then -- having forgotten that he lived in a gated community -- had to text him, while standing in the pouring rain, so that I could escape the gates. Just stood at the bus stop afterward thinking ""what the hell am I doing with my life?"""

"Meh, hasn't changed much since high school - I'm water boy or assistant at a gym, and a soccer team comes in from a game, emotions high after a close win. Spirits are high. Cocks are hard and high.

"Not the dog but the cat, yes . She always watches us fuck and stares very weird and disapprovingly. "
"I've posted this a couple times but here goes:

I met the same guy three times. First we met at a park and blew each other in the bushes on a hot Summer night. Next, I picked him up from a store parking lot and took him to my place. I took his virginity. Seeing his eyes roll up until I could only see white and hearing him moan as I fucked him was one of the hottest sights I've ever seen. On our third ""date,"" I took him out to dinner and paid for him to see a movie with me. We went back to my place because he was supposed to spend the night. He asked if he could tie me up for sexual fun. It's not my thing but I agreed. He tied me to the bed with a blindfold. He spent the next hour alternating between kissing me and sucking me off. He kept talking about how anxious he felt. He then told me to lift my blindfold, which I was just able to reach. He held a gun in my face and said ""This is a robbery. Pull the blindfold down. You're too trusting so I have to teach you a lesson. I really like you so don't do anything stupid. Be absolutely still.""

He then proceeded to load my car up with anything of value I had, my laptop, my smartphones, parts I had just purchased to make a computer for the Oculus Rift I expected to buy. He complained that I had so little of value. I told him he should have robbed someone rich. Before he left he offered me a drink of water and put socks on my feet since I complained of being cold. He then asked me if I was mad. I said, ""No, just sad, because I really liked you."" He stole my car and eventually I worked my way free and untied myself. I used my old desktop with Google voice to call the police. When they arrived, I merely told them I had discovered my car missing that morning.

Three month later he emailed me. He said he was very sorry and that if I could ever forgive him, he wanted to see me again. He said he liked how I talked to him. I told him if he paid me $2000 to cover my expenses, I would forgive him. He didn't respond."

"My SO always subconsciously grabs my hand whenever we're in really crowded spaces. Like I'll go ""awww, you're sweet"" and he'll retract his hand and say he didn't even realize he did, blush, then try to brush it off.

Maybe just make sure he keeps talking to you about things and try to make sure he keeps you in the loop on what he‚Äôs up to.   Try to influence him to be ‚Äòresponsible‚Äô..."

"had one of those ""cant host, cant travel"" guys. so i picked him up, took him back to my place, and when we got there he explained he had just smoked a ton of weed and so he wasn't horny. i offered to drive him back, he said he wanted to wait cause he might be up for it soon. so he just sat there high as fuck for 30 minutes until he decided he was ready to leave.

runner up was when i went down on a guy and he smelled/tasted like he'd never taken a shower in his life. a couple seconds in i just stood up and said ""you smell terrible, i'm not doing this"". he just apologized and left. took me like an hour to get the taste out of my mouth"
"Had a hookup once. It was all really nice (nice conversation, nice sex). Not until he says how I remind him of his dead boyfriend who got murdered. "
"Wow! That is definitely a lot to take in. Although I don‚Äôt agree with their timing, they probably thought that your coming out convo was an open door for them to come clean. Again, I don‚Äôt agree with how they did it, but I can see why they would seize that opportunity. 

I‚Äôm sorry that they tried to ‚Äúheal‚Äù you and that you were lied to your whole life. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever heard of someone being told that they **weren‚Äôt** adopted."
"You know what? You're right. I'll try to stop doing this. 

There's a guy I don't find attractive messaging me on instagram, and although I do respond to most of his messages, they're usually short responses or I ignore his messages that don't end on a question. A girl at my gym who doesn't know I'm into guys is also messaging me, and I'm more polite to her because I'm afraid of hurting her feelings.

It's definitely a weird double standard. Maybe it's because guys tend to mistake friendliness for attraction, so being cold is the only way to not lead a fellow on."

"My worst experience was one time I was going to a hookups house, he was a cute guy, said he was 25? or so, and we spoke for like 5/6 days before this. So i figured it would be ok to just go to his house to exchange blowjobs. Well as I pull into the driveway, 2 old men (60+) are sitting there, waving at me to come in and join them, and then 2 older women came out too. So I guess they planned on catfishing me and also inviting me to an orgy with two 60 year old couples. I pulled right out and left, blocked them and never went to that area of town again. "
This subreddit is a open forum. A lot of homosexuals sometimes just need help talking through something with someone who gets them. We all suffer some of the same problems.

If you read a post and decide it's something you don't want to be involved in stop reading it and move on. We shouldn't just cut off are own kind because someone else has had that problem solved.

"I‚Äôve been positive for a few years now. I got tested at a screening of ‚ÄúPriscilla Queen of the Desert‚Äù. You got a glow-in-the-dark condom if you did, and I figured, why not? I had no real reason to worry. 

It was a rapid test and it came back positive. They drew more blood for more labs to confirm. I instantly fell apart. Rarely are these tests ever wrong, but it can happen. 

Though it was very hard at first, I came to terms with my diagnosis. Honestly, I‚Äôm probably more healthy now than I was before thanks to regular labs. The medication isn‚Äôt too bad except for in the beginning you may experience side effects. My friends are incredibly supportive. Once healthy, I began dating again and honestly being positive had minimal impact on my love life. 

Life is what you make of it, and this is too. I‚Äôm sorry that you are going through this, and it may seem scary now. However, be strong and push through. You can do it. "
"I‚Äôve posted this before on Ask Reddit:

I met up with a guy from Grindr once in a 24 hour fitness parking structure at like 5pm. We agreed I was just going to blow him, which I was okay with. I get into his passenger seat and put my glasses in his cup holder and literally as soon as my mouth went around his dick, he shoves my head all the way down to the base of it. Caught me way off guard. So he‚Äôs basically aggressively throat fucking me but I hadn‚Äôt had a chance to take a breath, I‚Äôm trying so hard to pull my head up so I can breathe but he‚Äôs forcing my head all the way down and I‚Äôm literally panicking so as soon as he finally lets go of my head, I said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this dude‚Äù and walked out of his car. As I walked as fast as I could toward my car, I hear him turn his car on and his tires squeal as he reverses and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm about to get run over but he just drives off. I blocked him on Grindr but then realized I left my glasses in his car. Luckily my insurance covered them and I got new ones lol. "

"I think if you are attracted to someone you tend to like their smell in general.

It depends. I don‚Äôt like the type of bi guy that treats gay sex as just some kinky thing he does when pussy isn‚Äôt around. He has to be capable of having romance and feeling love for another male. 
I definitely understand the Mormon guilt.  I realized I was gay on my mission.  The president before ous had a rule that the bathroom door couldn't be closed.  That way you would know if your companion was jerking off and report it.  It led to a ton of missionaries when I got there that had no bathroom door and didn't care if someone was watching them use the bathroom.  And that's when I realized that I was gay.

"this is a really common symptom of depression and it‚Äôs hard because the solution is the problem. 

the problem is you can‚Äôt do anything and the only way to get out of it is to do something. people like to suggest going outside or cleaning your house, but these are daunting tasks for the depressed and it‚Äôs too easy to just not. my approach is to start small. like really small. so instead of cleaning my room, i‚Äôll clean my desk. and if my desk is really messy, instead of taking all the dishes down, i‚Äôll arrange all the pens on my desk and stack the dishes for later. 

usually if i can at least start something, i can easily walk away from it if it becomes to much or it will cause a runaway affect and before i know it i‚Äôve gotten my entire room cleaned.

"I was drinking with a friend of mine and about three drinks in i blacked out. Now, i was a heavy drinker in those days at about twenty drinks a night and this wasnt like any blackout i ever had. We were watching a movie on his floor and he moves us to his bed. He says something about being a mermaid inside and i blackout harder and quicker than i ever have. I wake up stripped naked on the living room floor with his mom that randomly let herself in to his apartment screaming at me and then kicked out of the apartment by my friend. When i asked him later all he said was that he gave me a bj and assured me thats all that happened but there is a part pf me that to this day still thinks he slipped something in my drink. Worst hook up ever and what makes it worse is that he wouldnt have needed to drug me (assuming he did). He literally couldve just said ""hey i want to fuck"" and i wouldve been all over his weiner."
"As someone who has never done anything with men before, but has some experience with women:

* **GO SLOW**. There is absolutely no rush. Relieve him of any pressure to perform in a certain amount of time. 

* **BE GENTLE**. It's his first time. He doesn't quite know what's about to hit him. It's going to be awkward, and exciting at the same time. 

* **FOREPLAY FIRST**. Hold his hand, kiss him softly, wrap your arms around him, bring him closer towards you, whisper sweetly in his ear that you want to make him feel special. Kiss his neck and ears, rub your fingers aside his, gently stroke his thigh. Ask him if he'd like you to go further. Be patient. Be loving. Tell him he's sweet. 

* **USE LOTS OF LUBE**. It's his first time, so it needs to be as messy and full of lube as possible to make sure he doesn't tear anything. I've never had ass play before, so I'd imagine I'd want any form of entering as smooth, wet and gentle as possible. Be gentle. Fingers, first. Make sure you can fully insert two fingers in before even attempting to put your cock inside. Make him familiar with fingering to get him ready for penetration. Ask him to relax. When you enter him for the first time, hold his hand gently, and ask him to hold yours back. Gentle strokes. It's NOT about pounding, it's about slow sensual motions, in and out. Not all the way deep, if it helps. Slowly, and gently.

* **DON'T USE TEETH WHEN SUCKING HIS COCK**. Use your tongue, your lips and alternate between mild suction and licking. Teeth will cause irritation to his sensitive glans. Maintain eye contact. 

* **USE A CONDOM**. He's a virgin. Don't make his first time a memorable trip to the hospital.

* **LOTS OF CUDDLES AND KISSES AFTERWARDS**. Hold him. Tell him how much you enjoyed every second with him. Tell him how amazing he was to hold and touch, and kiss. He'll probably feel a little bit confused by what's just happened, so just reassure him and kiss him. Cuddle him. Comfort him, and make him smile."

I live in a small town so he's like 45 minutes away via highway. I get to the hotel and find his room. He opens the door, and he's at least 30 pounds lighter than his picture looked and was pretty disheveled. I'm not usually a judgy person but this guy looked rough and malnourished. We made awkward conversation for about 15 minutes and we eventually started talking about wrestling. This led him to suggest that we wrestle in the bedroom to loosen up. ""Fuck it"", I think, ""this is already weird"". We start wrestling in our underwear and I pin him down several times, it was actually kind of fun. Then he stops abruptly and rushes to the bathroom. He begins vomiting loudly for several minutes and I decide to grab my things, tell him I'm on my way, and go.  Was much more patient with the hookup process after that."

"My SO has a bit of a macho side to him, where doesn't like to initiate cuddling - he would rather be the one who ""reluctantly"" embraces/acts as a protector to me.

However, more often than not when he's only been asleep for a short while, he'll roll over (he usually falls asleep facing away from me) and cuddle right up to me, draping his arm across my chest, and nuzzling his head next to my shoulder, or onto my chest. The best part is that after I wrap my arm around him, he usually lets out a contented sigh, and drifts further off to sleep.

He either doesn't realize it, or pretends that he doesn't know he does it - either way, I know he enjoys cuddling just as much as I do üòà"

"Don't forget, there is a difference between being out/open and blasting it to the world :). So glad you feel empowered! But maybe there is no need to change into rainbow clothes next school day either :).

"Being scared is a perfectly normal reaction. Right now your mind is probably going a million different places, and you're probably getting overwhelmed with all the different things you see and hear. The best advice I can give right now is to breathe. Yes... breathe. You have so much going on that you may be forgetting to do that. It will take time to get the 100% results. If those results are positive then there are steps to take. In the meantime, take each day as it comes. Allow yourself to be okay, and to be not okay. Let yourself experience emotions. It is okay to scream, cry, be numb, be scared, be overwhelmed, to laugh for no reason, to just feel. You are going through something very serious right now, and you have to live through the moment, and not be stuck in the moment. No matter what the results are you have a whole group of people who will support you... or at least one. Hugs and best wishes brother!"
"Tbh, you have to stand up for yourself man."
"Confront them.  Next time you're in a group with some of those people say loud enough for people to hear ""there are people group texting about me saying I'm an easy slut, it's not even true.  You'd think they'd have something better to do than spread rumors about me...""

No one likes being called out on their behavior and some people might feel bad."

"Plane crash. Somewhere in the tropics. I‚Äôm the only survivor.

I swim to the shore of a lone island. It‚Äôs well-sized with a mountain and plenty of trees.

Though I was fully dressed in the plane, somehow I come ashore in just underwear. Briefs, white.

Exhausted, I lay on the sand trying to process what has happened. Suddenly...

A muscled, hairy, masked man finds me on the beach and points a spear at me. He takes an interest in my white underwear, then before I know it he‚Äôs yelling out.

A group of men in various shapes and sizes come out of the trees and surround me. One seized me and throws me over his shoulder, and away they carry me.

I am brought to a small village at the foot of the mountain, where a tribe consisting of rugged men worship a sexual god of some sort. Inspected by the shaman, they deem my white underwear as a sign of virginity.

They rip them off, and my naked body is touched and caressed by the priests. They bathe me, shave me with a sharp rock, and cover my genitals with a scented oil. Tie me to a post with ropes and cart me to the foot of the mountain, where a small shack lay.

They say some words I don‚Äôt understand, but all the men look at me hungrily as I am untied and led into the shack where a bed of furs lay in the center.

Then, one after another the men come. We make animalistic love repeatedly, thrown around and against walls, every possible way to be taken, sweat drenching the furs as I moan in ecstasy at their rough, but tender embraces.

Having satisfied every man in the village, I am led up to a stone temple in the side of the mountain. There, the ‚ÄòKing‚Äô takes me in his chambers for what seems like days.

Our lust becomes so great, the mountain erupts as a volcano and the lava consumes everything. Even us."

I too am a fellow anxiety sufferer and non-drinker. Can‚Äôt drink with the prescriptions I have been given anyway. Just realize that you are there for fun, just like everyone else. Take it slow. Maybe go to a bar with a friend ? You can prepare yourself for that security blanket in case some social fears become realities. And trust me, when they happen (i.e; being ignored or not talked to) it‚Äôs not nearly as bad as you think it will feel. It will happen, you‚Äôll go into a temporary shock of ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt believe that just happened‚Äô but this giant wave of ‚Äòfuck it- NEXT‚Äô will hit you, and you‚Äôll be on the the next guy striking up a conversation. 

Perhaps practice gay conversation with guys over Tindr or Grindr ? Take what they say with a grain of salt, but this way you have some sort of expectations of what you‚Äôll find when you start to branch out and come out of your shell ^^ best of luck buddy ! We can do this !! "

"Oh my lord. I hear these insane stories about mission presidents, and I just thank my lucky stars I didn't get one of those. My mission president found out I was gay and was cool with it. When I admitted that I was groomed as a kid and had sexual relations with a lot of older men over the course of my early teenage years, he sent me home. He sent me home though in part for the whole sex thing, but also because the Church agreed it was best I go home, get counseling, and apply to reenter, so like, it wasn't malicious. "

Funny thing actually, when I was 11 I was told I would be between 5'4"" and 5'10"" and I didn't want to go anywhere beyond 5'6 because I thought that being any taller would mean I wouldn't be ""cute"" anymore. Seems that I got what I wished for because I'm 5'4"" now... "

"&gt; He seemed to realize that he took it too far

Ummm, that happened when he started yelling in your ear instead of respecting your wish to leave so you could both cool down.... 

That is insanely problematic and NO it is not better because you are both men. 

Quite frankly, were my husband to do that to me... the engagement would be (privately) off and I or he would be staying somewhere else for a few days. Especially if while it may has never gotten physical, he has used other emotionally, mental abusive techniques to try and/or to get his way. 

Edit: really, really reflect on whether this truly was a ""one-time"" thing. It may be physical for the first time, but that kind of controlling behavior is rarely only a one-time event. DV can take many more forms than physical violence. "

"My group of friends in high school were very cavalier, always talk about sex, flashing our boners and doing slightly gay stuff on dares or as pranks. One friend was more so then rest(he was pretty hot too) he would smack my ass on random occasions, grab my dick, shook it and laughed when I got a hard on while working out once. When we were 17 we started watching porn and jacking off together. I always wanted to just lean over and slide his dick in my mouth but never had the courage to for 2 years when he took a job out of state. The last night before he left he confesses to me that he was bi curious and of course we did have sex that night. We keep in touch but never hooked up again and even though we did once I still look back at all that time we had together and think what a wasted opportunity "
Why or how the fuck are you still calling him a good friend after all this shit?
Have sex with women.
Maybe move?
"Well, I‚Äôd wager a lot of guys on Grindr do lol"
It's because gay men want only guys they find attractive to show interest in them.  Life doesn't work like that but there are ways to reject someone without being a douchebag.
"That‚Äôs awesome, just be appreciative of it rather than being concerned with why it can‚Äôt be like this more often. There was a fantastic quote from Stanley Kubrick yesterday on the front page about why he doesn‚Äôt do drugs, ‚Äúwhen everything is beautiful, nothing is beautiful.‚Äù"
"Ok. I‚Äôve used it before and had a really weird experience. I found a room in Miami that was super close to the beach, great price and even had a hot tub. I was supposed to go with a friend but that fell through. 

When I got there the host seemed fine, he was a little older and super energetic. We exchanged numbers to make sure we could reach each other and I left to explore the city. 

That same night, I got a text and when I checked it, it‚Äôs a picture of his gaping asshole looking at me. He said it was meant for a different person. Oopsy. 

The following days were an escalating set of circumstances that left me extremely uncomfortable. This included walking around in a jockstrap, walking in on him passed out on his couch with his dick in his hand and porn on the living room tv and the most awkward invitations to go into the hot tub. 

So I‚Äôd only recommend it if you‚Äôre getting the whole place. "
"Missionary. Feels very intimate and makes it easy to be passionate. Doggy style is non-interactive, I feel like I'm fucking a moaning log and I want to make love, kisses and cuddles. Also, what's the point of pinching nipples if I can't see the pain on their faces, at least without a mirror?"
"I travelled to San Francisco solo for my birthday. Met this guy on Tinder, he invited me out. We hit it off, got shit faced, and went back to my hotel.

We hop in the shower. Have a laugh. And then we finish fucking haha"

"Met up with a guy who had a beautiful ass. Had him face down, ass up  to eat out his hole when I saw a pin worm ""peek"" out of his sphincter and quickly go back in. I told him he needed some meds and he said that he knew. We ended up talking for the rest of the night but didn't have sex.  "
"I spent a few days talking to this guy on Grindr, then eventually went over to WhatsApp, we both had issues finding time to meet due to work so we chatted for a while. We spoke about serious stuff but never anything major revealing. He never asked for nudes, and neither did I so it was all good. But you know, some secret desires and stuff obviously got shared. 
Eventually we both had a Saturday off and I agreed to go over to his place, very excited and ready for a fun time I rock up at the door. I ring the bell and eventually a lovely black lady opens the door for me. Now he was like, a 30 something year old white dude in all his pictures so I was a bit taken but I just assumed she might be a housemate or something. She was very friendly, knew my name and everything so I assumed they shared a lot. I was a bit nervous but also much hornier so it  wasn't gonna stop me. I walk into the living room and there he is seated, wearing no pants and a baggy shirt just staring off into space. I say hi, he says hi but doesn't even turn to look at me. I was like okay.. weird.. The lady then offers me a drink and tells me to get comfortable... She brings me a gin, I sit down to chat and he just doesn't look at me. not once. answers my questions but doesn't make eye contact or turn his head or anything. 

long story short. 
he was blind, and she was his care-giver. which means, for weeks I had been sharing secrets, some sexual, with her.. and she would read those to him and respond on his behalf. I was mortified. 
good hookup though. "

"As a feminine gay guy, I have noticed that I seem to attract a lot of bi guys over gay guys (possibly because I'm feminine and some bi guys like femininity in their partner over gay guys) and well... At first I was very open to bi guys since they were the only ones who seemed to not have a problem with me not being masculine but then I started noticing a pattern with the bi guys who expressed interest in me and that was how...

* They were only interested in a sexual fling. They typically didn't want to have a real relationship with a guy and wanted to end up with a wife and kids so they only pursued guys for sex only and never for serious dating.
* The other half of bi guys who expressed interest in me were guys who were married or had girlfriend but wanted to fool around with a guy behind their back because to them, it was either they didn't consider it cheating because it was with a guy and not a girl or the ""what she doesn't know, won't hurt her"" thing.
* They were VERY finicky when it came to guys. They say they would date a guy but then they get unsure and go back to not wanting to because they don't think they can handle being in a relationship with a guy and being thought of as gay.

Needless to say, I was mortified because A.), I want to have a real, monogamous relationship with someone and B), I think cheating is just disgusting. But needless to say, all the bi guys I've ran into were like this and honestly, my view of bi guys is not very high because of these reasons and this is all in the span of 8 years mind you. 

The biggest issue I have with bi guys is that they don't plan for the future and that to me is an area I really don't want to be in. I don't want to date a guy who can't decide whether he wants to be with me or be with a girl. Yes this can happen with gay men too but at least then, you know that they will end up with another guy unlike the bisexual guy. 

-sigh - But anyway, would I date a bi guy? Here's the deal. I have to REALLY like him and he needs to like guys enough to want to have a real, non-closeted relationship with. I have yet to see this in my own experience but I know it's out there and if I met a bisexual guy who was comfortable with himself, wanted to date a guy for the LTR and not just s fuck-buddy situation, I would be more than happy to date a bi guy."
Goddamn I hope not haha.

"Surprisingly, that was it. I did the work for the session, watched the porn for about 5 mins in my room while he stood guard at the door. Then i returned the cd to him when it‚Äôs time for him to leave. No one ever found out, nothing more than that happened. I passed the semester and the tests with grades good enough for my parents ( i‚Äôm Asian living in an asian country) so I never saw him again after that.

I started searching (at first, for porn) and and eventually educating myself about lgbt after that. If anything i have to thank him for saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok, two men having sex is not a crime nor a sin‚Äù and not ‚Äúew, you‚Äôre sick ima tell your parents‚Äù when i asked for gay porn. My conntry was not open-minded at that time. It was not the best introduction to the gay world but a good start anyway.

"Obviously there are a few people here who say they wouldn't date a bi guy for whatever reason, but I feel like the ""more likely to cheat"" thing is usually a misstatement.  I don't think bi guys are more likely to cheat, nor have I ever actually heard anyone say that outside of reddit. The issue for me would be whether or not you are out of the closet. If you are closeted bi guy, especially one with conservative friends/family, you are way more likely to dump me and find a girlfriend when you are ready to settle down rather that come out and introduce me to all of them. And that's not a some kind of slight against anyone's judgement or morals, it's just so much easier. I would say it's what I would do, but I'm sure that if I were bi, I would have just lived as a straight guy.

So, I guess that's the question to you. Are you out and proud of being bi? If so, I think your crush is an idiot. If not, I completely understand his position. "
"My boyfriend had to leave the country for a great career opportunity. Normally, I would simply go with him, but the nature of his profession requires him to travel practically all the time, for long periods of time. In my line of work, changing it all the time would be pretty much impossible. The last thing I wanted was to stand on the way to his dreams, so after many hurtful days and discussions, we decided to move separate ways.

It would be so much easier to break up just because one of us would cheat and we would hate each other, but we actually were a really good couple and we loved each other a lot. I still remember that we had this official ""last night together"" that was supposed to end in the morning with the final farewell. It was supposed to be romantic and passionate, so we would have good memories, but because of all this shit I couldn't get myself ""up"", lol. We spent the whole night cuddling and sleeping and basically remaining silent.

In the morning, the taxi arrived and the time for farewell came. Damn, that one was hard, I thought my heart will break. We kissed for the last time, had a really long hug, ninjas started cutting onions and he left. Sometimes I stalk him on Instagram. It's nice to see him do well and be happy."
