"My money's on Stan Lee. Not that I'm *hoping* it'll happen, but the dude's 95..."
"My best friend used to live with a guy, Stan. My best friend also used to have a cat. One day my best friend came home and found that his cat was gone. Stan admitted to taking the cat in his car and dumping it somewhere random because it annoyed him. That was years and years ago, and I think my friend has since forgiven Stan, but I can't imagine how. I don't even know Stan, and I'm still mad at him."
