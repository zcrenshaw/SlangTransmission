"I'm a scientist. I believe that your wife wants you to watch her purse because a captured purse that finds itself in the wild without its primary captor will attempt to eject, or vomit in *layman's* terms, the various items with which it had been theretofore engorged. It is your job as a secondary captor to prevent this. Methods include: peeking in, looking in out of the corner of the eye, clutching it with one hand, and placing it on your lap. However, once the primary captor, your wife, and her prot√©g√©e, your daughter, return the purse will no longer have the opportunity to save itself.

You're welcome."
"Leave out the part about her reaching in her shirt.  It's irrelevant, she stopped suddenly to bend down and pick up something.  You ran into her because you weren't paying close attention"

"Sounds like your only motivation was to better yourself in order to get a relationship. Not uncommon.

Now you need to find a new cause. You completed your goal, it's good to celebrate. But, if you don't continue to be the motivated person they fell in love with, they'll likely lose interest in you since you're no longer that person.

So it's time to make new goals. Do you want more friends? A better career? To make more money? Take over the world? Build an iron man suit? Become the best ttrpg player at the Olympics?

Sit down, write out a bunch of goals. Work towards them, you now have someone who has your back to help you reach those goals, nothing is out of your grasp."
"I only have sex with someone I am officially in a relationship with. While in the past, I have made out with girls I met at parties, or had a fling with, and greatly enjoyed it, when things started to move towards sex, my brain just couldn't handle any more. Then I realized that I just don't feel like having sex unless I have genuine feelings for the girl, which for me only happens in a relationship."

"When it comes to romantic relationships I'm highly monogamous, even when it comes to what you might call ""pre-dating,"" where people will go on multiple dates with multiple people before committing to one. I won't even do that. I believe in giving one person at a time my full attention. 

I think this still represents the majority of people so maybe it's not correct to call it old fashioned, but I think tinder and other aspects of modern life have loosened the idea of monogamy in some people's minds, and I'm personally not on board with that."

"As shitty and useless advice as this is, don't force trying to find friends/a gf. It won't work.

My advice? Focus on yourself. Get into the best shape of your life. Join a gym and go to the classes. Don't feel embarrassed to do them in front of people. Just be yourself.

This, to Me, is the best advice anyone can have. It hits so many birds with one stone. 

Edit: I say it's shitty advice because it's hard to just...care less."

"You need to sit down and introspect why you feel this way. What's driving you to feel that you have wasted a lot of time?

There are a few ways to address this, in my view. 

One, understanding why you feel that you have wasted time and what would you have done differently. This is important because this helps you not repeat the same mistakes in the future.

Two, thinking about whether it really was a waste or there were a few good things that came out of those years. 

Three, acknowledging that the past is the past and there's nothing you can do to change it.

I just got out of a long term relationship. We were married, and the last few years of our marriage were miserable. I had a lot of hard feelings about having wasted those years, missing companionship and love. Being alone and not having invested in myself. I harbored a lot of resentment at myself at others. 

Sometimes, this manifested itself in ways I wasn't used to dealing with. Like jealousy or anger or just deep sadness. 

It took me some time to realize that it's okay to feel that way. It's only natural. But it doesn't help anyone to feel this way without fixing it going forward. 

So, I had a very clear view of what I wanted in a relationship going forward. I know what I would have done differently. 

Two, I have a beautiful son who came out of that relationship. No matter what else, he makes it all worth it. 

Three, I cannot change the past. And I wouldn't be who I am today and where I am today without that past. So it's time to move on. 

Today, I'm in a much happier place but I'd be lying if I said it didn't take time and effort. Good luck. "

Since you have different properties, it may be necessary to exaggerate the behaviors to reduce suspicion.

"I am in my 50s but got a vasectomy when I was young after i had a couple of kids. Best move i ever made.
Occasionally I bumped into someone who wanted kids and was disappointed but i always countered that by saying I would gladly have more kids and if we.got that serious I would have it reversed.
But by and large  it was great, I would at some point find a way to let that drop early on and they would never say it but I knew the wheels would turn and they would think ""I dont have to worry about fucking this guy and getting pregnant"" and this eliminated the main reason for wearing a condom. I never wore a condom once since I had the vasectomy and I never contracted an STD.
There was one time I met someone and we had sex pretty soon, think it was the second date, she never said a thing in advance and we just did it, it happened suddenly. Then a day or two later she texted me about how much fun she had, we need to do it again soon, hope an accident didnt happen. I said dont worry about that, I had a vasectomy, she actually didnt know what that was but said that cant be right because you came inside me. I said that's just the ejaculate, there is no sperm in it. She said ""Whaat, that cant be right"" I never heard from her again, she ghosted me.
Which lead me to believe I was either being setup as a patsy or she just wanted a sperm donor (or she met.someone else.and ghosted me)

It's not nice to talk about your wife that way

"Back in high school I used to walk past the train station every day and on one of these mornings I noticed a brawl was happening. I was in Year 12 and  I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô3 skinny asian kid but I would never let that shit hold me back. One of the younger guys from my school who was actually much bigger than me was getting ganged up on by an even bigger Pacific Islander fella from a different school. He was getting hammered not only by this big fella but other people started jumping in and stomping his head into the ground. As soon as I saw this from across the road, I ran between this guy on the ground, separated everyone and stood literally eye to chest level with this huge Islander guy. Some other people from my school were around and pleaded that I back down because I was about to get eaten. But I didn‚Äôt back off and said to he huge guy ‚Äújust back off man you‚Äôve already won‚Äù. The guy who was getting stomped on was bleedin on the lip, the Islander considered it for a moment and left. I helped the younger guy up and told him to fucken defend himself next time cos he literally just froze there and copped it. He‚Äôs been a friend ever since. That was 6/7 yrs ago. "
"Advice that women tell men tends to fall in the line of:

* ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù

* ‚Äúbe nice and gentlemanly‚Äù

* ‚Äúbe confident‚Äù

* ‚Äútreat her like a princess‚Äù

And almost all of these when interpreted correctly can be successful, it‚Äôs just so overwhelmingly vague that it‚Äôs moot and incredibly susceptible to misinterpretation.

It‚Äôs socially acceptable (and easy) to tell a struggling man these four buzzword phrases though, but in reality it‚Äôs the least effective thing you can do. 

On the other hand you have seduction corners and pick up artists who will have less moral tactics like negging, push/pull, crap like that. And these wouldn‚Äôt be taught and passed around if they didn‚Äôt work.

The sad part is that weirdly enough, the manipulative bullshit works. Guys who have figured out pick up and seduction can boast serious sexual prowess (talking triple digits) all based on manipulation. Naturally, these guys have a bad reputation amongst social media and society. (They don‚Äôt give a single fuck about their reputation, they‚Äôre getting laid.)

On the healthy intersection of both corners is the following advice:

* be passionate in your endeavors

* live a purposeful, upbeat life 

* work on your physical self so you‚Äôre happy with your appearance, either through working out/lifting, playing sports, skincare

* be open to new experiences so you can build an interesting life and be an interesting conversationalist

* practice being social and being in social settings to maximize how comfortable you are around others and *importantly, how comfortable others are around you*

* never show complacency; keep moving forward in pursuits and passions

All of these will mold you into a well-rounded, productive, interesting person that not just women, but people will want to be around. Once you have them, you get the luxury of figuring out how you want to be treated, instead of worrying about how you‚Äôre gonna treat someone else."

"I'm a dude who recently just got out of that age range. Dating freaking sucks for people around my age. I work in a male-dominated field and so like most others, I resorted to online dating. Tinder, Bumble, Plenty of Fish. 

What I got there was 10% happiness and fulfillment, and 90% bitterness, rejection, and blows to my self-esteem. I was going out on two dates a week for months on end and talking to countless other women simultaneously the entire time but I could never nail anyone down where the attraction and desire to be in a relationship went both ways. Sometimes it was me who didn't want to pursue anything, and others it was her. 

I'll tell you, nothing upset me more then talking to somebody who I thought would be great and then I end up getting ghosted. It only happened a couple of times but ghostings really sucked. 4 days afterwards, I would look back through everything I had ever said to this girl and if we had gone on a date, I mentally try to replay every bit of conversation that we had to see if I had done anything creepy or off-putting. Every time I came up short as to reasons why I warranted a ghosting.  

one night I ended up going on a double date with this girl I had already been on a few dates with as well as that girl's best friend and one of her Bumble guys. We had a great time and the guy and I ended up parking near each other and on our way to our parking lot we got to talking about our online dating experiences. He was super tall, really nice tattoos, good-looking, charismatic, and funny. He's the absolute last guy who I thought would have trouble dating online but he said that he's pretty much had the exact same experience as me. His self esteem took a hit after every bad date, rejection, or ghosting. Girls are just so brutal on there, and I'm sure guys aren't much better. After so many of those, you just have to wonder what's wrong with you even if it's not something that you're doing. However, it certainly feels like it is.

I'm sure that somebody somewhere along the line will come up with a much better name for this phenomenon than me, but dating nowadays is suffering from the Tinder effect. Standards are set so unbelievably High by so many people and any perceived slight is an automatic death sentence for any potential relationship because the allure of something better literally at your fingertips is always there, lurking in the back of your mind. Every time you get a match or somebody hitting on you online, that's just a little bit more of an ego boost that I feel like some people get addicted to. 

I also wonder what is happening psychologically when you feel the thrill of a new notification from a match or something only to realize that it's somebody that you really did not want reaching out to you in the first place and you are inevitably disappointed. If that extreme high and extreme low of dopamine keeps hitting your brain I wonder how those experiences are rewiring your synapses. 

I feel like those apps are ultimately bringing more people together than they are driving apart but it has completely reshaped the landscape of dating for young people now. If you're not physically attractive you're going to have an extremely hard time. Hell, even if you're a guy, you're going to have an extremely hard time. I've had several very average looking platonic female friends show me their dating site in boxes and the amount literally hundreds of messages per day on places like OkCupid and Plenty of Fish. I can't even imagine what super attractive women get. How is the guy supposed to stand out among numbers like that? 

For anybody who's having difficulty right now in your mid-20s, let me tell you something a little encouraging that might be coming down the line; when people start to hit their 30s, I've been told that standards on both sides relaxed a lot. You have people that are getting divorced or are chipping away at their unrealistically high standards for a partner and people who tend to be older just in general suck less. "
"One of my good friends and his wife had another couple over for dinner, and I joined them all afterwards for some board games. I brought most of the games as I have a small collection, we taught the other couple how to play a couple different ones, and everyone had a pretty good time.

At one point, one of the other couple brought up that it almost appeared as if I had been hired entertainment for the evening. They had been invited over for dinner, and then their hosts had arranged for this other person to bring some games and keep the evening going. It was said completely in a joking manner, but what hurt was that I had had very similar thoughts recently. I try to stay as active as I can outside of work, but I've also been single for a long time, and pretty much everyone I know in this town is a couple. Whenever I see them it's like I have to be providing something to the occasion, like food or games or something else along those lines. Her comment just spiked my depression up for the evening, and I spent the next few hours at home wondering if anyone actually really enjoys my company."

I turned around, walked back to my friends, stripped down to my swimwear, and jumped in! My friends were all yelling with excitement, and I jumped a shitload of times after that. After that I kinda adopted this idea that I gotta do something I don't want, and most times I'll benefit from it.  Rad."

"Story time! 


My best friend growing up has always had these weird poop specificities. Like, when we were in elementary school he would try to shit as little as possible so that on the days his grandmother picked us up from school he could shit as soon as we got to his house so that she would reward him for it. I remember the day Mortal Kombat came out because he was writhing in pain all day holding in a 3day turd because he was one grandma-poop away from getting a video game. Needless to say we played Mortal Kombat non-stop that weekend. 

Fast forward to our early 30s and he calls me one day to ask me if I also ‚Äúdo the toilet paper dip.‚Äù Little did I know that he was expecting me to just go along with it and validate for whomever was listening that he wasn‚Äôt a disgusting person. Much to his dismay I had no clue what The Dip was, let alone methods of execution. 


Curiosity (and almost my entire life worth of experiences with him) led me to emphatically insist he fill me in on The Dip and elaborate on why he was calling me to ask in the first place. He promptly ended the call with the reassurance that he‚Äôd call me back in a few. 


15 minutes later my phone rings and it‚Äôs him. He‚Äôs breathing heavily and clearly walking at a brisk pace. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúDude. Wtf was that all about?‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúJust quit my job.‚Äù This answered the obvious questions about his breathing but made this whole interaction even more mysterious. 


He starts by explaining The Dip. The Dip is a process he created in college to overcome the fact that he doesn‚Äôt have a consistent poop schedule (likely due to his colon being stretched mercilessly over and over again for Sega games). Since the poop comes when the poop comes he‚Äôs more often than not pooping in a public restroom. To compensate for the lack of available shower or baby wipes, he uses The Dip to get his veritable forest of assholehair clean after every poop. Once he has expelled all of his poop he flushes. He then takes the toilet paper and folds it into a 6-10 ply towel of sorts. He dips this towel halfway into the toilet water. He quickly removes it from the water, executes a speedy wrist flip, and then proceeds to clear the hair-ea around his anus with the wet half while using the pinched dry part as the handle. He repeats this process until he feels clean. That‚Äôs The Dip. 


On this particular day the men‚Äôs restroom at his place of employment was undergoing a remodel so everyone shared the women‚Äôs bathroom. All of his coworkers were gay men except for one female and she hated him due to him not remembering they had a one night stand and forgetting her name when she started working there. Anyway, he goes to take a dump in the ladies restroom and realizes there‚Äôs no toilet paper after having what most would call MuddButt. As a result of said MuddButt his assbeard was caked. So he thinks fast, waddles over to the next stall, strings the toilet paper over the partition, and proceeds to do round one of The Dip. Midway through his third round of The Dip the line breaks. Just like before he waddled over to the other stall but this time as he‚Äôs rounding the corner (penis out, pants at his ankles) that girl walks in, freaks the fuhhhhhck out, and starts screaming at the top of her lungs. He freezes. Everyone within earshot comes running and sees him standing there. 


The manager is the first one there and after the initial shock tells my friend to get dressed and meet him in his office. He goes and talks to the hostess and she basically says she caught my friend jerking off in the middle of the bathroom. He comes back to his office and asks my friend to explain himself and give reassurance that something other than masturbation was occurring in the women‚Äôs bathroom. It‚Äôs at this point that he calls me in a last ditch effort to save face. I failed him. Miserably. 


Oh well. Shit happens. 


Edit: Holy shit (pun intended)! My first gilded comment! Thanks kind stranger!"
"&gt; You could talk to her about it and apologise.

Only if you happen to bump into her before reporting it to hr/management on Monday (no pun intended). DO. NOT. Go out of your way to find her, talk to her, or apologise. You don't want to seem like you're trying to cover your tracks and avoid a sexual harassment complaint. 

Talk to HR. Let them know how distracted you were (with your phone, tps reports, daydream, whatever) and you ran into this woman because she abruptly stopped in front of you. You only put hands on her for SAFETY, after you tripped over her. Tell them that you don't know the woman and you just want to apologise."

"It's non-existent for many of us.  

I generally don't like a lot of the ""manosphere"" subreddits, I think they're somewhat toxic, and further promote the toxic hookup culture we're seeing, but the one thing they do get right is that a small percentage of the best looking men are sought out by all women, and the women think they're worthy of it because those guys are willing to smash for one night.

The rest of us are just kind of, there.

It's kind of sad.  If a slightly above average looking guy like me who's introverted thought he should have access to the best looking women, a lot of people would call me cringey, or entitled, but women's entire attitude when it comes to finding a partner has come to revolve around that line of thinking, and nobody bats an eye at it.

I don't blame women for following their base instincts, and for smart phones, and social media further enabling it.  I'm not really angry over it or anything, but I'm allowed to express my discontent, there's a lot to not be thrilled about for most men, and our problems aren't just flat out ignored, they're actively denied and shamed for having been brought up."

"It's tough to say what is bullshit and what is ineffective and what is a little manipulative.

The most common dating advice(Be yourself, just go about your life and you'll meet someone, etc.) tends to be really ineffective, but really authentic. If you meet someone you really like just going about your life, chances are you'll have an awesome relationship.

The most effective dating advice works really, really well but is ethically questionable. Stuff like not texting back just to make them want you more, posting pictures of yourself with other girls on social media to make the jealous, etc. is very effective but ultimately puts you in what can be a bad spot for a relationship. If the girl is only into you because you ignored her and made her jealous it's unlikely that attraction will last as she gets to know you.

I don't really think any of it is bullshit as much as different things work for different people. If you're a really cool guy, being yourself can be very effective. If you're boring and not that attractive, you might find playing hard to get and making girls jealous is far more effective. "

A career exists so that you can make enough money and provide for you and your family. Everyone I've talked to who has claimed to ""absolutely love work"" has looked tired and stressed as hell. It will suck more and more of your life away from you, and decades will slip through your fingers. 

I think companies have a huge economic incentive to create a mindset that working is equal to prestige and self-worth. Thus, you have many (young) people willingly working 60+ hours a week without overtime since they're salaried employees making 40k a year. 

This isn't to say that work is unimportant, but I think too many young people overvalue work, and too many companies are demanding that their employees give their entire lives to the company.

"&gt;  Focus on yourself.
its actually the best advice. 

take it from some one who's gone backwards. I got into shape, talked to people, made friends, lost friends, did things, kept my schedule packed.. it was the most rewarding part of my life thus far. I was focusing on making my self better, going to the gym and school. Everything else follow suit.    

Then life happened, my life style changed. I turned into a lazy fuck. Im a fat shit and work a dead end job. few friends (like one at this point). I mostly do the same, play video games, watch anime, masturbate, and go to work. 

But, I know that my life is like this because Im not putting effort in and thats where it comes down to. You get back what you put out. You want more money, you gotta put in the hours at work.. you want a better job, you gotta put time into schooling and work valued experiences. you want to have valuable/fun experiences you gotta go out there and find them, dont wait for them to come to you. Same with friends, you gotta put out before you can expect to get anything back but do things for you and invite them along, if they turn you down go to that thing you wanted to do anyway, maybe you'll meet some one there and whatever it is you probably will have some similar interest.      

 gotta put in the work. just fill your schedule with shit to do that gives you something in return. Video games are fun but you dont really get much out of them at the end of the day.          


one of the other things I kinda did to sort of gauge my ""productivity"" levels was when meeting up with old friends or family that the only things I had to talk about was work, dota (the main game I play), and things I saw on reddit. You can get a short conversation going with people about your work but starting every topic with ""I saw on reddit"" gets lame real quick (and aint no one want to hear shit about dota). When I was filling my days with shit to do I always had things to talk about, things I was doing, things I saw, people I talked to, stuff I experienced. Keep in mind this was a pretty short time in my life and it was several years ago (im not even that old so dont think im like some old timer, im just tell'n ya my story thus far) but I remember that short period of time as being so much more than it probably really was but its so much more vivid to me than than the last few years that have been mostly filled with a blur of nothing.         

so, you do you. find something you want to put effort into and just work towards it, recommend something that gets you out of the house.      


oh, another thing.. and this may sound a little silly but if you litterally cannot think of anything else to do.. if you have any means of travel (idk where you live) but just get up go some where, any where, roam, wander.. whatever. Some times you'll find your self running into interesting stuff. Granted more often than not you probably wont find anything but the times you do find something interesting those will stick out in your memory and you'll be glad you did. I mean 90% of adventuring is just walking around, the movies only show the good parts when the heroes get to something interesting.. you gotta find that interesting stuff and only way to get there is to getup and go.

"I‚Äôm in my first serious relationship. While definitely less lonely than before, I find myself feeling kind of generally lost and unenthusiastic about life. 

I think I‚Äôm finding a huge part of my motivation before to stay healthy, work out, excel in my job, earn more money, etc ...was rooted in the pursuit of a good girlfriend, or impressing women in general.  My gf loves me unconditionally, and says she would never leave me unless I cheated on her or something bad. Idk guess I don‚Äôt really feel any of that motivation anymore now that I ‚Äúhave her‚Äù with no risk of losing her. Even going out on the weekends with friends or  traveling or exploring new places was at least partially driven by the possible excitement of finding a new girl. Now that excitement is gone...It feels like something is missing when I do those things."

"Open car door, and be sure to walk in the outside lane as to protect them in case of danger."
Asking out my longtime high school crush. We‚Äôre married now. Haha. Just kidding. She said no.
"I have the opposite problem. I only feel extremely motivated when in a long term relationship. So here's my thought process:

""My gf loves me unconditionally"": yes, mine too. But my conclusion is not ""hence, I can just let everything go and she will still love me"". My conclusion is ""I love her too, and so I want her to have the best lover she can have. The lover who balances his time between staying healthy and in great shape, doing well at work and not letting her worry about money, having interesting life experiences he can share with her, and generally being the shining star of her life.""

When I didn't have a gf, I still wanted to be a great guy to attract girls. But for me, the motivation of being awesome to a faceless notion of a random girl who might or might not become my gf, is much less strong than the motivation of being awesome to my actual real gf.

Hope this helps!"

Unless there's some pattern of other incidents you aren't telling us about, no reasonable person would consider that harassment or assault - and yes, most women and most HR people are reasonable, even ""in 2018.""

If you happen to see her again, I think it would be fine to say something like, ""Hey, I think I bumped into you in the hall the other day, sorry about that! I just wanted to apologize, I felt so awkward at the time I didn't know what to say!""

"Because we evolved for intelligence, and away from physical prowess.

We're actually, for our size, the weakest in the animal kingdom.

There is literally no animal your own size that you could beat in a 1-on-1 fight with no weapons.

Feline your size: you're food.

Bear your size: you're food.

Other primate your size: you're dead.

Horse your size: get kicked with a hoof, you're fucked.

Fish your size: get eaten.

Crocodile your size: get eaten.

Rhino your size: get trampled.

I'm having a hard time thinking of what animal our same size we could beat 1-on-1 with no weapons.

Edit: maybe a sloth. 

Edit2: realize that we evolved to:

1. Work in teams. A group of 10 humans can take on a bigger animal if that animal is alone.
2. Work with tools/weapons. We dominate the planet because we figured out how to create sharp objects, put them on the end of a stick, and use that to fight off animals while keeping a safe distance. After that we figured out how to control fire, and some thousands of years later we started making metal weapons... and well, you know the rest. 

These two things, our teamwork, and our ability to develop tools, are products of our brain. You can even see, in comparison to other species, how utterly useless and hopeless we are as infants. During gestation, most resources available for the creation of a new human go to making the brain as big as possible, and this comes at the expense of everything else, so we're 100% dependant on our parents for many years after lactation is already done.

The only thing that bothers me about all this is that we've forgotten how dangerous nature is, and have been choosing to look at it at something beautiful, instead of something that can kill us with ease.

Now, I'm a strong guy. I'm 30, and I've been lifting weights nonstop for 12 years. I could probably still run the 400m in less than 50 seconds. But drop me in the middle of the African savannah with no food or water, or tools, and I'd die... probably of thirst once I realize I can't come anywhere near that pond over there because it's full of crocodiles. Could I stay alive long enough to shape a spear from a long stick? Maybe... maybe not.

That whole situation would change in an instant if you gave me a rifle with lots of ammo."

Don‚Äôt beat yourself up too bad cause there are tons of ppl in relationships that will just end in divorce, some will have financial problems, and some will have TRUST ISSUES

"Bruh, every shit is resplendent when you know that there's a bidet involved. Most people would whinge and whine that water upon there butthole feels unnatural but tell me, does the sparkling, cool bliss of water tickling your brown eye after suffering through the fires and fury of a jalaoeno infused burrito that you liberally covered in a hot sauce bukkake not the most sumptuous yet invigorating feeling? Does it do you good to suffer through the thick, dry, and gritty toilet paper that mere asses wipe with until they resemble the flag of Japan? And not even the modern one. I'm talking the battle flag from world war 2. Give me a reason not to feel Poseidon's kiss and grab him in his bearded face and smack my asshole firm with his watery lips. "

"Tried E for the first time at a party at a coworker's house.  These two cute little raver girls were talking to me and when they found out it my first time rolling, they got so excited.  I could tell it was their Favorite Thing.  They took me in the kitchen and gave me tastes of different fruits and stuff, grabbed soft fuzzy throw pillows for me to stroke, and gave me a backrub, which all was amazing of course.  Then when they ran out of stuff for me to try on E, and then they got a mischievous look in their eyes and one said to the other ""Should we?""  And then they pushed me into a comfy chair, pulled my pants down and gave me a long, slow co-op blowjob.  When I busted, it was like going in a wind tunnel of explosive color and sound.

2) After girlfriend gets out of prison, has to pay back thousands of dollars in fines, but can‚Äôt get a job because violent criminal record. Potentially goes back to jail because cannot pay fines because no money.

"I'm the same, but I don't need a full on relationship. I just gotta at least be friends with them, see how they act around other people, have similar interests. I can't just hook up once and be done, that's so boring and I don't feel physically aroused no matter how attractive the guy is."

"I‚Äôm 25 and it‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve asked a girl out in person.

The first 3 times I asked girls out on a date in person, I got rejected all three times so I think that has me a little scared. 

I always see guys saying they wish they asked out or hooked up with more women, but honestly, how does one even go about doing that? I feel like I meet a fair amount of people, but also as a guy, I feel like a lot of times I‚Äôm very restricted in who I can even ask out. For example, I‚Äôm not allowed to date any of my sister‚Äôs friends, even though some have shown an interest in me. And going up to a random girl that you might find cute and asking her out seems to be so frowned on nowadays.

Dating outside of college feels so much harder."

"I want to double down on this: DO NOT TALK TO HER ABOUT IT, until it has been officially ""handled."" The fact is, there is nothing good that can come of it until it's cleared in a legal sense. Afterwards, if you're so inclined, you can apologize.

The fundamental issue with apologizing first is that she may be able to use it as leverage for something from you. You want to avoid this kind of thing entirely. This is what your HR department is for. They don't do much, but issues like this, they are there to protect the employees from assault AND from litigation stuff. They don't want you to get in trouble. They want to make sure nothing illegal is happening at the company. What you did was not illegal, most likely. If you did it every day, or were aggressively sexual, made it a hostile work environment, maybe it was. But if it was an accident, it's just like bumping into her elbow."

Okay, do you remember saying sorry? I‚Äôm a little worried that because you were too flustered to say sorry (which is understandable especially in this situation) she may be a little creeped out...

"54 year old Dad to three now-grown daughters here. My life as a Dad started out like yours. Now, my then-girlfriend is now my wife of 31 years, and I can honestly say that being a  surprise Dad was the best thing that ever happened to me.

I‚Äôll let you in on some secrets: Every Dad has anxiety every day. No one is ever prepared to be a parent. My youngest kid is 25, and I‚Äôm still learning how to be a good Dad. Kids are incredibly resilient.

The fact is, you are going to be a Dad. The only question is, what kind of Dad will you try to be? Since you‚Äôve already got the job, commit to doing the best you can with the tools you have. Being a Dad is more than committing dollars to the kid. BE THEREfor the kid. Read to him or her. Teach them to ride a bike. Toss a ball around. Just spend time with them being their Dad. That‚Äôs all they‚Äôre looking for when they‚Äôre young.

Life doesn‚Äôt end when you‚Äôre a Dad. It just gets better.

"I shouldn't necessarily not be done, neither. Take it on a case-by-case basis.

It feels like overstimulation. It doesn't feel like this, but imagine when you've just woken up in a pitch-black room, and then walk out into the sunlight. That oversensitivity to light is an analogy for how it feels to stimulating the penis after climax. In that case, you shouldn't keep going.

However, sometimes it's more like when you need to sneeze a second time just after sneezing. That need to sneeze again kind of dies off too fast, so you try to stimulate it enough so that you can get that sneeze out, because that release is so sweet. That's an analogy for how it feels on those rare occasions that you should keep going. That's when reaching a double orgasm is easiest."

Deflecting compliments. 
"I'm rather uncomfortable around women that seem to dress 'to attract.' Like, their boobs are hanging out, or they're wearing ultra ultra short shorts, or their makeup is rather heavy, or their clothing is so tight it looks uncomfortable.

I just feel like they're trying to get me to look at their tits or their ass, and it's uncomfortable because I try not to ogle women I'm not in a relationship with.

It's not a huge deal; after all, I worked next to a girl who dressed that way for over a year and I was able to mostly ignore her clothing, but it often made me a little uncomfortable.

By the way, this doesn't really apply to swimwear, as bikinis and the like are standard dress so it's easier to just ignore, if that makes any sense."

"I got into some trouble when I was younger and ended up doing time in state prison. As a chubby, straight-laced white kid prison was really not something I ""fit the mold"" of. So I mostly kept to myself. I stayed working out, kept my area and my body clean, and had a respect but distance from other inmates.

This didn't sit well with some of them. 

I had some canteen money from my parents, and had top ramen and coffee, etc. If someone was broke and had nothing, I'd generally share. One time a Sureno gang member asked me for a cup of instant coffee, and I gave him one because I had it to spare. A bit later he came back and asked for another, but I refused. Said that I had enough left for me, can't give him two, etc. The guy puffs his chest, bumps into me, and says ""Well how 'bout I just take it then?""

Honestly I was scared shitless. He was half a foot shorter than me, but built and definitely would have backup if we fought. But I was also raised to think that a coward dies a thousand deaths. So I asked ""Well dude, you got any friends in here?"" And he started talking shit about how ""fuck yeah homie the Surenos run *deep* in this joint"" or whatever shit. 

I told him ""Ok then. You go get all of them together and I will fight each and every one of you motherfuckers."" And he backed off. Never spoke to me again after that. It's now my story that people never believe happened, but it's one of my proudest personal moments.

 * (Took me ages because it turns me away) Talking about OTHERS that are interested in them.

* Hints for you to ask them out

 * Mentioning they are hungry or thirsty
 * Mentioning places they want to go
 * Mentioning things they want to see or do
 * Mentioning how they don't want to do something alone.
 * Mentioning how bored they are and they want to do something.
 * (Didn't realise this for ages, as again, it turns me away) Mentioning how drunk they are. They want you to ""take advantage"" (Apparently)

IMPORTANT TO NOTE:   
This is not the case for every girl. Some are just friendly, like I said. Others don't do these things. Some just act really nervous, and sometimes that makes them seem cold or angry.

If somebody just really likes you, even as a platonic friend, they might do a lot of these things. Romantic attraction is often just like a more extreme platonic attraction. Very similar at times. 

It's way easier to see from the outside because you get to see how the people act separately and together. If somebody tells you that they think someone likes you, they have a better idea than you.

Basically, I've gotten much better at spotting this, but I currently lack the confidence to follow through. I can find the buried treasure, but I can't dig. It's an important step that I know I need to get over (by failing a few times) but I'm just preoccupied with other things in the meantime.

This got a bit long. Sorry. "
Lol why the fuck did he do that?
"In terms of grandkids, I know it‚Äôs scary that severe mental instability runs in my family. But don‚Äôt worry. It always skips a generation. "
Where I live it's all dogs. I swear most women on tinder would rather fuck a dog than a real live human bean.
"sorry, girl here. but i am so pissed that yall can just get that shit done. i am getting closer to 30 and and since i was 21 have wanted my tubes tied. i have no interest in having any children at all and yet i constantly get told i will change my mind and i have to wait till 35.  &gt;=("

"Turned 20 recently, I never had the teen love people talk about, I've had so many memorable experiences but I've never had a girl like me back. I'm a bit depressed about it but everything else I've done makes up for it."

"&gt;  simply wasn't partying enough

Man, I've been through those regrets so many times. I'm 27 now and I haven't been to a club in like a year or something. As my 20s draws to a close, I'm often caught up in negative thought loops like ""shit, I should've partied more, and my youth is nearly over"" I like drinking, but it's usually just with one or two friends in a bar maybe once every 2 weeks, often while watching soccer. 

However, the more I examine the negative and regretful thoughts about a wasted youth, the more I realize the constant partying lifestyle is not what I really wanted; it's what I think I should have been doing based on societal expectations. 

People who party all the time: yes, they have fun. But they are often in poor health. And even if they take care of themselves outside of the partying lifestyle, there's no way all that partying doesn't affect you mentally in terms of anxiety. Particularly if, like me, you're prone to bouts of anxiety and depression. 

Furthermore, I'm actually quite introverted, so yeah, maybe I could've partied a little more, but I would've quickly reached a point where it was too much. 

I just feel that as an introvert it's difficult to feel comfortable in a society that fetishizes the ""Jersey Shore"" lifestyle of going out to a club, trying to score with women every week. 

Then I think to back to all of the amazing books I've read in my 20s, to the time I dedicated to learning to play acoustic guitar, living in Thailand and learning about their amazing food, stuff like that. I don't think I would've done those things while living the party lifestyle at all."
Call me crazy but I don't send pictures of my penis to anyone because that would be gross.
"&gt;I swipe right less than 10% of the time and I don't think the algorithm likes me any more :(

Actually the ELO algorithm they use on Tinder favours you for being more selective. They ""punish"" people who swipe right on everything with lower quality matches."
"I don't drink pop or juice,... so I can drink beer every day. My coworkers think I'm a health nut. But I'm just a  high functioning alcoholic. "
"meaningless sex with different women?  no problem.  got that covered.

*attempting to actually DATE?*  it's weird because the general consensus is that you shouldn't approach women in public because they'll approach **you** if they're interested.  otherwise you're just bothering them &amp; it's creepy no matter how attractive you may be.

this is literally what a woman has told me.

ok, so enter internet dating apps.  after swiping left through a sea of women I'm personally not attracted to, I might come across one that I am.  great.  let's take a look.  oh.  *okay*...a list of requirements one must have.  height, job, ""must love dogs/cats/children"", she might like my dog better than me, must be into everything she is.  hmm.  pass.  repeat cycle.

nevermind internet dating, let's check out the bar scene.  ok, group of women having ""girls night out"".  one thinks you're hot &amp; chats you up for a while...her friends drag her away because you're ruining their ""us"" time.  fine...whatevs.  girl sits down at the bar next to you...she's cute, you converse.  she has a chip on her shoulder against the world/men in general.  it gets awkward.  you decide to roam around.

enter drunk flirty girl.  *every* song is her song &amp; she wants to dance to all of them.  you're on eggshells because you don't wanna come off as the guy that takes advantage of drunk chicks.  she makes out with you a bit, you decide to ask for her number &amp; maybe contact her when she's sober.  you exchange numbers &amp; she's hauled off by her friend(s).  you're leaving &amp; you see her chatting up some other guy &amp; they wind up leaving together.  well fuck that then...

next thing you know it's Sunday, you're bored so you pick up your phone &amp; you thumb through chicks you've dealt with before.  you stop on one &amp; think to yourself for a moment.  ahh fuck it, why not?

*""hey!  what have you been up to?""*"
"I was working at a 7-Eleven when one of the feral crackheads notorious for begging for scraps outside came in and started sexually harassing one of my customers, ""macking on"" her...and I just lit the guy up. Went full R. Lee Ermey on the guy.

Wasn't trying to impress the girl‚Äîshe just paid for her order, thanked me, and left. Wasn't trying to look like a badass‚Äîonly other person in the store was my boss, who I knew would have my back if shit got real.

I was just sick of that guy's shit and decided to puff out my chest and get in his face about it."
"My general rule is if I ask 5 questions in 10 messages about completely unrelated topics then she obviously isn't into the conversation enough to keep it going. 

Normally I'll know this type of girl when you get ""wyd, wbu, nope, yeah, haha"" more than you get real sentences."

"It's not a choice or ideology, it's a medical diagnosis. If someone experiences gender dysphoria they are transgender. It's been recognised as a mental disorder for some time. "
"You want a conservative woman, yet all you do is post on porn subs. Look in the mirror."
"When a woman doesn't initiate anything in terms of future dates. Look, as a guy I get it's our role to initiate the first date, first kiss, sex, etc. and am fine doing that. But if after 3 dates you aren't offering an idea for the next date then I'm fucking out. I'll do 60-70% of the work but not 90%"
"Also think of the kid. My sister has a 5 year old daughter and stayed in a relationship with the dad until the daughter was three. They are now split up and my niece spends more time with my family than with either of her parents. My sister is constantly working because she is a single mom, and she refuses to sue the dad for child support because she doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with him. The girl‚Äôs father doesn‚Äôt really care about her either and will only occasionally come see her or call her. She pretty much doesn‚Äôt have a father figure in her life and hardly sees her mother. "
Sign me up. That would be a kickass weekend of adventuring.
"Taking cheap shots at people they've just met and brushing it off as  a joke. It's not funny or clever, just makes the person seem insecure."
Texting gives me more time to think on what to say.
"&gt;If the girl is only into you because you ignored her and made her jealous it's unlikely that attraction will last as she gets to know you.

Spot on.  And if through time you stop making her jealous or stop the behaviors that attracted her to you in the first place, she'll likely lose all attraction for you; at least that's been my experience."
"They are.  Women receive so much positive attention on the internet that it makes me not want to participate at all.  The whole thing is really rigged against you if your an average, or even slightly above average looking guy now."
Look in the mirror. You might scare it away. 
"You talking about at the gym? This happens to me at the gym daily. Out the way, I'm vain as fuck."

"I'm sure this has happened to many a pet owner.

Woke up once (rock hard as well) to my cat sitting in my lap, kneading away.

Ended up shooing him away and throwing on a porn vid.

Sometimes I think cats do that shit deliberately, just so they can give you that ""you're disgusting"" judgemental look they do when they see you jerking off. For real, any *other* rapid and repetitive movement under the covers, they're pouncing, but not for *that*. They know *exactly* what we're doing.

"Suits. I fucking love wearing double brested suits, and I don't care at all. "
"She gaslighted me into thinking it was normal to get your boyfriend to do all of the chores by telling him that them not being done triggered her PTSD (and claiming that her cooking and managing the calendar was more than 50% of all possible chores once he brought up the inequality).

I put up with it until I became isolated from friends and family because I was spending literally all of my free time doing shit for her.  

She, of course, did not return this level of effort into the relationship and eventually I was forced to move out to save my own sanity.

She took advantage of the fact that I take being a good partner very seriously and basically would freeze me out/cold shoulder whenever she got only 95% of what she wanted."
"Lol. If she's so tactless and arrogant to say that, there is a 99% chance that she's a basic bitch who sets her value by the amount of instagram followers she has. Actual high quality women have class and are kind when rejecting men. 

That said,  rub it in by being awesome. There is no such thing as a bad reason to be a better person."
"I‚Äôm with you on this one big time. 

Also into ‚Äúold fashion courtship.‚Äù I don‚Äôt text a girl all day, or anything like that. I‚Äôll call, ask her to dinner, perhaps some fun activity.

Mostly one night stands that turn into multiple night stands.
"&gt; I'm a scientist.

Are you wearing a lab coat? Cause otherwise I don't know if I can believe you."
It means I was checking you out. If I look more than once it usually means I think you're attractive.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you turned 26.  
"It keeps looking more and more like social media, its gross"
"As with what a lot of people say, basically the second best time to plant a tree is now, right?

You're 21, I'm 22. Before I went to university I was a total loner, hardly any friend because of how far away I lived. Overweight because of how sedentary I was.

All changed when I joined uni at the age of 19. 3 year on I'm the happiest I've been in all departments. 

You're still so fucking young mate. "
"I hold doors for people.

This is strangely specific.
"I am 24. Never been in a relationship.  I used to work 60 hours a week and hated it. I didn't have a life. I literally ate, slept, worked. No ""me"" time, and the time I did have i spent catching up on sleep. I got a new job, something I never saw for myself and I love it. My old job I had to work 6 days a week mandatory overtime. Anyway, im getting at that now i have weekends and i want to have a life. I have done so much this summer. how? I highly suggest looking at facebook events, you can search through local events. I have found things going on around me I never knew of and they are awesome! I ask my friends to join and they also suck and don't go. Thankfully im close with my sister and we go to things togeather. But i am not afraid to do things by myself."

In a perfect world, profiles would be required to show at least these three photos (since they're really the only ones that matter) - headshot where you fancy yourself up, normal day to day non fancy full body photo, photo where you're doing something you enjoy.   I need to see your best, your average, and you in a more candid photo.  

Bonus: If you have any of these in your profile, change them immediately 

* Like to laugh and have fun

* Can't live without: air, phone, friends, chapstick, coffee

* Living life to the fullest

* Always up for an adventure/looking for partner in crime

* ""Don't message me if"" requirements (like, if you're not at least 6 foot tall, if you aren't a die hard feminist, etc etc)"
"Or she's just really attractive and they have no clue about the ""underlying issues"" or history of the relationship.

Honestly if it was as horrible as is suggested and small complements are affecting /u/LordDariusBlakk that much; he should either seek individual/couples therapy or get a divorce. This kind of attitude/thinking will only lead to the emotional ruin of him or his wife."

"Tons of people seem to treat others with a one drop rule mentality and seem to think it's ok. Not just on the internet.

"The greatest, unrelenting hard-ons I've had are in moments when I'm receiving and experiencing unconditional love and acceptance of me. The physical feeling of a good vagina is a close, intoxicating second, but there is nothing both physically and emotionally that gets me hard like the first one. It's a completely different sexual feeling altogether. Great memories."
A few years ago I was pretty high and I asked the girl what she thought about the smell of rain.
"I think it depends on the situation. If it's a first date or beginning of the relationship and I ask a girl to come out and have dinner with me, it's only right I should pay. She might not have gone out to a fancy ass restaurant to eat but she did so to meet me. Asking girls to split the bill  is just one more reason for them to say no. If it's a relationship where I'm comfortable with the person and we have a basic understanding of each other's finicial situations I wouldn't hesitate to ask her to go dutch."
I think she might be over compensating for your brother. 30 YouTube subs talking about politics is barely a hobby.
"I've only told them that I cannot have biological children. One told me ""that's something you only tell someone you're in a relationship with"" and another told me she does want kids some day but she is interested in dating me.

"It‚Äôs not too late for passion. If what I‚Äôm understanding from your post is clear, maybe your wife would love to pursue some more passion in her own life as well. There‚Äôs no need to thrust yourself into world travel, but as kids grow older, you slowly regain your old freedom and can do these things again. Maybe it starts with going for walks in a different part of town or picking up a new hobby like photography or stand up comedy. Passion is still out there and there is a way to get to it even through the smallest steps. They eventually build you up to a place where you want to be. "
"it is a causation/correlation mix up. Men who are happier, healthier, and in better shape are the men that women want to marry.

Also you didnt mention earnings, but that is another stat that ""married men earn more"" whic is also a mix up.

"I'm definitely not the same way. If I marry a doctor or a PhD or lawyer or whatever I'm not making them change their name. They put in the time, effort and money for that and it's silly to expect them to be Dr. _me instead of their birth name.

Two times in a two days now the top upvoted comment on r/askmen is of the form ""this is super vague and I refuse to give an answer until it gets clearer""; you people are improving.

I don't own a dishwasher. This is the first I'm hearing about that making me old fashioned though. Thought it just meant I can't afford a dishwasher.
