"We serve ""hot fresh baked pretzels"" for $8.95.  

We get em by the case frozen.  Roughly $75 per box.  100 per box.  We get 33 orders per box and one to eat while figuring out math.

33 orders X $8.95 = 295.35.

So profit is 220.35 (minus the cost).

So with that 220.35 we pay the electric, gas, rent, taxes, staff, equipment, etc.  And thats assuming we sell all 33 orders of pretzels.  Stan my line cook eats an order.  Boom, down to 32.  Jose burned an order.  Down to 31.  Barb sneaks one home in her purse. 30 orders.  3 pretzels are broken in the box. Down to 29.  So our 220.35 just went down to 184.55 pretty quickly...and very easily.
