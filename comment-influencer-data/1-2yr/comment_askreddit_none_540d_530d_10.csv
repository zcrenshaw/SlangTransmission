"All men *should* be taught not to rape. We grow up seeing movies of male protagonists always getting laid at the end and it gives us a false sense of entitlement. Combine that with our evolutionary instinct that drives us to have as much sex as possible. And factor in the social expectation for men to make the first move.

I've never raped anyone or even come close to it, but I understand the factors that cause any average guy to lose control and force himself on a woman. These are the kinds of things every guy needs to be taught about, it's not as simple as ""don't rape""."
That's a really great experience to share with your partner and I really hope you can get married some day.

"Yes. It is there for a reason. To not exceed your vehicle *beyond* it. The line does not exist because you *must* pull all the way up to it.

Also, most people who do this? They do it in the event they get rear-ended so that their their vehicle and, by association, their mortal bodies do not end up smashed in the intersection. 

So look again at what you wrote here.  

&gt;Pull up to the line...it’s literally there for a reason....

Every time you think something like this or tell someone something like this?
You're telling someone that their LIFE does not matter to you - at least not as much as your time and impatient over something as insignificant as a little traffic. Does traffic really matter more to you than another human life? It is not your life to dictate. They are at the intersection. They get to decide their level of safety. When you are at the intersection, you can decide."
"And the writer/director went on to write/direct The Last Jedi.

"Can I respectfully ask why you think its such a phenomenal movie? I really really dislike these movies as I feel as though nearly all of the decision making in each movie is just... asinine. 

So, to go through all of this effort and try to make a (somewhat) thought provoking movie with just...... idiot characters...... I get that its entertaining but why revere it?

If we're looking at movie making parts separately and objectively, okay cool, I can respect certain elements. Its just..... I had them on in the background while I was cleaning my house about a week ago and I just don't get why people like these movies.

Again, im not trying to be a jerk or argue, im genuinely curious of others opinions."

"I'm surprised people stuck out until Andromeda, genuinely thinking it was going to be good. How could any Mass Effect game be good after Mass Effect 3?

A game made on that premise was destined to fail. And it did."

Also, central america is completely modern??? Really? I mean i have not been down there, but i was under the impression that it is still somewhat under developed.

"That's true,  and that would also work both ways in the example I gave. The problem I have with that is you are arguing by exception which is not a valid argument that can be used to debunk the valid generalization I made.  Also, at that point you could argue some people don't like people saying ""Good morning"" to them.

&gt;If it is in the right setting where you can expect flirting it can be fine or if you are dressed up. 

I agree with this part. I've told some of my clueless male friends that passing a pretty girl on the sidewalk is not the time to launch an introduction.  We guys should understand that pretty girls are a lot like tom cruise.  They have way tooo many people trying to talk to them, and you really need to be sensitive about that.  Conversely, when guys go to bars so they are in appropriate place to flirt and approach (men are expected to be the ones that approach and they don't find it easy) they are treated brutally.  Tip: don't take a drink from a guy you aren't interested in then just ditch him.  I know a lot of women don't like to hear that because, hey, free shit and validation.  If a man bought a man 2 a drink (platonically)  and man 2 just bailed that would be just shitty.  It's the same when a woman takes a drink in a bar (platonically or with interest) It's especially disrespectful because bars are the appropriate place to try to mingle, and again, it's the male who is expected to approach even if it's for platonic conversation."
