"&gt;he won't leave me alone about it

You don't have to subject yourself to it, though. You can't make him ""not pissed off"", all you can do is make yourself unavailable whenever he hassles you about it. Hang up the phone, leave the room, whatever. He can ""insist"" all he wants, and you get to say ""no"". You're a grown man and he can't make you do anything."
"So you're saying that to be in a real relationship both people have to be virgins? Just trying to clarify your viewpoint here.

Edit: based on your post and comment history (some of which you've tried to delete; it's still able to be viewed just FYI), I don't think the way you view relationships or women is healthy. "
"If you were 37 and in a relationship with an 18-year-old, would you expect that 18-year-old's parents to be thrilled about it?"
"Look man. She lied to you. Posters are going to forgive her because of the content of what she lied about. However, these same posters will rant about how lying is stealing someone of their right to make an informed decision (i.e., their agency). The truth is that their latter opinion is true. When she lies to you, she steals your agency and betrays your trust. "
"Yeah your edit really doesn't really shed the light on anything to be honest. 
"
"He didn't assume anything. He wrongly interpreted their agreement. So he thought she said that she would pay for it, he didn't assume she would pay for it. It's miscommunication."
Its only a matter of time before he really uses his aggression against you. Don't wait for that to happen.
A cycle actually needs multiple states to cycle between. I only see one state of you being a mother to this abusive man-baby. What else is there to cycle between?
"When you’re 40 and this self-centered, you are destined to not have friends.

You want everyone to fit your schedule, participate with you in your preferred activities, on your terms.

Part of quality interpersonal relationships is the give and take aspect. 

It’s perfectly acceptable to want to live your life on your own terms, your own schedule, etc. But the cost attached to that is living the life you’ve described."
"&gt; Create a YouTube video or Medium article that puts through your side of the story. Talk about the process and be seen to speak warmly about your fellow contestants. (You should check whether you have any non-disclosure agreements first though, as u/WeirdGrowth points out)

I think this is just going to drag her through the mud all over again. While she may receive some support, there's still going to be an army of people badgering her about the experience, telling her she ""knew what she signed up for"", calling her a whiner, attention w*hore, etc. 

Since she has no intention of going back to the industry I'd just keep it buried. This will essentially force her to relive that experience over and over again and I can see how that would get really exhausting. 

I like the idea of changing her name though. That way she can still use social media and have an online presence. It sucks but I think it's the easiest way to move past all of this without re-traumatizing herself. "
"Bloody hell I actually can't believe the cheek of him. Other people have covered most of the bases about boundaries and what is a joint expense, but when you're paying for things pro rata decide how to do it before you leave. Putting the amount on a travel card (2k from you and 1k from him perhaps) and using that for joint expenses or something, since he definitely seems like that type to say 'oh you pay' and then him 'forgetting' to pay you back. "
"&gt; Maybe I could tell the boss that a few guests have complained?

No! Why would you make up a lie like that? That's not a little white lie when you're bringing false customer complaints into it, which could have a bigger impact on their job than a simple ""so-and-so appears to be suffering from halitosis and I'm concerned that if it's noticeable to me, it is noticeable to our guests"". 

Is being straightforward really so hard?"
"&gt; Like when I say “hey do you wanna have sex?” And she gets frustrated, I literally just want to fucking scream. I get almost shaking mad about it. All of these really negative thoughts about her pop into my head and I just feel completely disconnected.

I'm going to bet that she feels your anger. So when you ask for sex, she's not just hearing you ask for sex. She's expecting your anger and frustration.

Maybe it would help, besides seeing a counselor, to do a 100% reset. Sit her down and talk about the solution to this. Something like: for a period of agreed upon time, you won't approach her for sex, at all. Not even once. But in that time you'll both feed the emotional needs of your relationship and be physical in non-sexual ways. And if she wants to initiate sex she can. But for a while, no interaction between you will at all be tainted by the cycle of you asking/her turning you down/you being angry, or you asking/her not enjoying/you being frustrated. Set a reset button on that so the toxicity of what asking for sex has turned into for both of you is gone for a while.

After the agreed upon no-sex period is over, you'll go into your scheduled sex period. You'll both agree on the nights when you'll have sex, and both agree to put 100% of your effort into making it pleasurable and enjoyable for both of you. It'll no longer be something you ask for; it'll become something you both expect. Without the pressure of the asking/turning down cycle, you can both relax.

Also, try redefining what you think of as her being ""turned on"" because artificial lube may just be a part of it now. Now that she's had a child, her body is probably different, and she probably isn't producing as much lubrication as she did when you were both younger. Take the pressure off her body to be the same as it was; she might just be dry some nights when you have sex, no matter what. It doesn't mean something is wrong, it just happens sometimes. So buy some lube and have it ready to use."
"Insecurity is what my mind jumped to as well. 

If you're happy and your partner is happy she can fuck right off."
"Instead of thanking the universe for someone like you who saw him through one of the worst times in his life, he is out there looking for new sexual encounters because he feels deprived or almost deprived?

He is the OPPOSITE of deprived. He is fortunate and blessed and extraordinarily LUCKY to have someone like you in his life.

If anything, he should be online looking for ways to make sure you feel loved and appreciated and completely, totally irreplaceable in his life. 

He is a terrible, selfish, heartless person. At the very least, please do not move in with him.  But I hope you value yourself more than this and move on from this horrible man."
"THEY were the rude ones here. He needs to realise that, they need to realise that, you need to realise that.

Now I'm not saying you need to diss dad's name to his face, but I AM saying you dont have to handle them with silk gloves"
"A TV, Chromecast, a few t-shirts and ice skates?   You are about to fuck up your life again for less than $500?     Don’t do it.    

The way you communicate that you’ve changed is by staying no contact.  She’s a self-centered, user, abuser, liar, and cheater.   You don’t love her, she not lovable, what you are feeling is a sense of desperation.  It happens with abusive relationships.  You took some of this sub’s advice but you didn’t get therapy, you need to fix wha’s wrong with you in order to understand that she’s using you.  That desperate feeling you have, which you think is love is actually fear, you are afraid of being alone, afraid you’ll never find anyone “like her” because of they way she makes you feel.    

Everyone on this sub is hoping exactly that you never find anyone like her.  She was trading up, guy wise, until she remembered that she needs you for her Masters’s, her new guy won’t or can’t help.  So now the fake tears and emotions are back, she wants to see if she still has control of you.  If you respond she’ll know she still has control, and it will only be a matter of time until she’s got you wrapped around her finger.    

I know what you are thinking, “maybe she’s changed, everyone makes mistakes.”  She didn’t make a mistake, she made a whole bunch of decisions in order to cheat and hide it from you.  If you didn’t catch her she be banging him and coming home to kiss you with him on her breath.    Maybe she already did, but just lied about it.   

She’ self-centered, a liar, a cheater, a user and an abuser.  You can find most strangers on the street who will treat you way better.  Let her keep all the “stuff”, and use it as a symbolic way to let yourself know she’s out of your life.    

Don’t contact her again.  "
I know a lot of cheaters who say that. 
"And I’m telling you that you have a snowballs chance in Hell of having a healthy sexual relationship with someone after that. People don’t forget shit like that and it’s rare to be able to move past it. Keep trying if you want but the smart money is y’all won’t be together six months from now. 

Why not give **both** of you the chance to start fresh with someone? "
"The moment you are further under his thumb (that is, living with him), the abuse will likely escalate. Abusers tell you sweet nothings afterwards because if they weren't nice and sweet some of the time, their victim would be much more easily able to leave them.

Don't do this. It's been 8 months and he's already physically and verbally abusing you. ABUSING you. Often folks who had a rough childhood have an improperly calibrated abuse meter. They might find it hard to identify red flags, or to ""notice"" abuse. The facts are, he is abusing you. You love him, but he is not right for you. He is not safe. He cannot be your lifelong partner. He might well KILL you. Think about that. It isn't very difficult to kill someone. All it takes is one shove at the wrong time. People can easily fall and hit their heads and DIE. Take that in for a moment. He could KILL you. Probably accidentally, but to be honest he could do it on purpose too. He is willing to put his hands on you and hurt you. That should *terrify* you.

Btw, one of my dearest friends also has mental health struggles, and often attracted older men (e.g., college aged girl, 30+ man). These men always turned out to be predatory if not abusive. There are certain people who can sense vulnerability, and seek it out. Because they are horrible people, and they want to do horrible things to someone who is too vulnerable to escape. 

If you seek therapy and find the right medication, you CAN reach a better place. Strong support systems are incredibly helpful in this journey, but this abusive man is NOT a good support system for you. Once you leave him, you can begin your path towards being safe and healthy. Where you don't have to worry about someone hitting you when you express your opinion. With the help of therapy, you can learn how to recognize red flags, recalibrate your abuse meter, and value yourself so highly that you immediately take steps to leave abusive situations. 

PLEASE do not move in with him. PLEASE tell your friends what he has done to you. PLEASE document his abuse, in case he escalates once you break up with him. If he does escalate, PLEASE seek help (hopefully from the police). 

Good luck OP. "
"I mean I’m just guessing based on what she’s said, but it sure sounds like it doesn’t it?!

If we are seeing this many red flags based just on this post and one comment, I can only imagine what Sophie would say if honestly listing all the reasons she won’t recommend OP!"
"This is straight up abusive.

He spent all night terrorizing you about a video game.

Op, you deserve so much more than this. Leave. There’s someone out there for you who will treat you with respect. Don’t fall into the idea of ‘well we’ve been together so long, it would be silly to leave after all this time.’ No. It’s silly to spend one more second having someone treat you like this."
"Ugh.  /r/justnomil

We are so sorry, OP.  I am actually kind of bummed every time i recommend the sub anymore because...it's just so sad that people have to put up with this shit.  But yeah.  We are your people.   Welcome home.  Sort by top and all time for a real shit show."
"Why are you moving? Sounds like he's the one who needs to go. It's been 5 years why is he telling you this now? 

This happened to me at around your age but I didn't live with him. When he confessed I couldn't get out of bed for about a week or 10 days. Told none of my friends. I think I was embarrassed. 

Since you live together there are some practical things you need to consider. Are you both on the lease, when does the lease end etc. Hopefully he isn't on any of your personal accounts or have access. 

Right now you just need to go through all the emotions. Wherever you feel most comfortable. Whether that's with family or friends or locked up in your bedroom watching tv. It *will* pass. And you will be the better for it. So stop beating yourself up. Your last boyfriend was a loser and this guy is a loser. Their actions have nothing to do with you. 
"
Yep. At some point you need to be an adult and not insert yourself into other peoples drama. Friend could’ve very well put OPs job at risk along with her physical and mental wellbeing if boss starts harassing her again. 
"Since you agree that there's no rational basis for your anxiety, I suggest that this is a question about managing anxiety and worry. What methods of dealing with your anxiety have you tried? How do you expect your boyfriend to help?"
...why is this person still your friend?
What the f*ck is wrong with you?
"&gt;I can only cum when he's fingering me, but it's not enough for him.

She clearly feels pressured to do it because it's not ""enough"" for him. She obviously didn't have to lie but couldn't handle the situation in a different way because she's scared he'll leave her. So because of HIS fragile masculinity, she feels inadequate and disgusting, which to me is completely unfair. "

"This is the worst idea I've ever heard. First of all, there's no way two 16-year-old kids are capable of successfully faking their deaths. Secondly, if your parents are narcissistic they'll make your deaths all about them and their feelings anyway.

I feel like this is fake but then, I know 16-year-olds well enough to know that this is entirely possible. Do you have any family you can stay with until you're 18? Do you have a job so you can save up to move out? The best revenge is cutting your parents out of your lives and living them happily."
"It's not a request. You're not simply asking, are you? You're saying this is an ultimatum. In some cultures it is customary to eat with your hands. She may not be from those cultures, but the point is, who are you to decide what is normal? I would understand to a degree if you said she eats spaghetti with her bare hands, but this is such a big reaction for such a minimal complaint.

I would suggest you take a step back and look at your situation. You are now saying that she blew this way out of proportion, but as I understand it, you are threatening to end a year long relationship over this very petty argument.

You can't control her, and she can't control you. Love her for her, or end the relationship."
"You should break up and date a fellow vegetarian, as you are being unreasonable and judgmental by trying to control what she can eat around you."
I had babies in Japan and my obgyn told me sushi and fish in general were fine and even recommended. He did warn against some types of fish (swordfish? shark? Nothing I would have on my plate in any case) because of their mercury content.
"You should take this advice OP. Maybe if this woman actually faces some consequences she will learn her lesson. I also don’t think she should have her daughter in her care, she is very dangerous. I’m so sorry this shit thing has happened to you, and I’m really sad for you because I know how it feels when your best friend in the world betrays you like this. I hope you recover quickly. "
"There are literally thousands to millions of other people in your city who are more responsible and compassionate than Chloe is. Seriously, you can do so much better."
"To be more fair leaving things like that unflushed in a toilet is both fairly common, and environmentally conscious if he does it often.  If its her toilet tho, its her rules.  Got to abide. 

That being said, you dog taking stuff out of your toilet is a major sign of obedience issues with your dog.  I'm willing to guess that your dogs obedience issues are more prevelant to this argument than just the toilet paper."
Yes! Thank you! That phrase fills me with so much rage. It’s sexist and biphobic. I hate bierasure. 
Being a trainee is no excuse for SHAVING a dog when it’s only supposed to be washed and dried...I have no idea why you think that’s an okay mistake to make. You can’t accidentally shave a dog instead of washing it. As someone who owns a fluffy dog I am so upset for OP. 
I don’t think it would be less hurtful. Saying “I think your dead dad’s wedding ring is ugly as sin” (even if he softens the wording) will not be kinder. 
Unfortunately these things happen sometimes. Sometimes you two just diverge and that's life. 
"&gt; it’s totally unnecessary to play devils advocate when I’m having a personal conversation with him about racism

I think this drove home the point for me. No matter what our views are on racism in this country, and whether OP was actually discriminated against or not, as a partner in life, he has the responsibility to be on her side even when the whole world is against her. That doesn't mean that he should abandon his ideals; it means that you support your partner even when you disagree. "
"The *only* people I would consider loaning money to would be a parent, but not for a fucking Escalade. They can GTFOH with that shit.

"You have every right to say no. I would never want my SO to sleep with someone else. Don’t force yourself to be okay with it if you aren’t. 

I think even if she does sleep with someone else, she’ll realize she’s not missing out on anything. "
"Why are you friends with her?  

She’s not being “too cheap” she’s being selfish and manipulative to get free stuff and she’s winning.  
Basically you’re enabling her behavior. 

If you want to still be friends with her, she needs to learn social skills from you and friends, but you need to give her tough love. "
"I was on medication for anxiety and those fuckers did make me feel tired basically all the time. I never made it my girlfriends job to be my personal alarm clock though. 

Your boyfriend needs to not lie down in the afternoon after work. Don't have a nap and take let yourself have the opportunity to have a nap. He then needs to go to bed at a reasonable time which will help in the mornings. Then he needs to find an alarm clock that works. Not just the weak ass phone alarms. Get a loud alarm clock that doesn't snooze and put it on the other side of the room. He needs to get out of bed to turn it off and not get back into bed.

Its tough to get out of a bad routine but he needs to take the steps to make it work and not make you his alarm slave."
"OP, I'm so sorry.

* If you live in an EU country (which still includes the UK as of right now!), have you considered taking advantage of the right to be forgotten to have Google clean up your search results?
* Have you considered getting your name legally changed? It'll be a hassle, but could very well be worth it to be able to shake off that past. I'm sure most people don't recognize you on sight from the show, especially since it aired years ago. It's your name that's indelibly tying you to that show. If you change your name, that should help tremendously.
* I know if I found out one of my friends was on a reality show at 18/19 and was portrayed badly (or even acted badly), that wouldn't really affect my perception of them today. We all have pasts, and have all done things we wouldn't do again in retrospect. I feel like most of the people I come across socially are also pretty nonjudgmental. Are you in fashion or some industry where the norm is to be super-judgy? If so, that industry may not be for you.
* **Most importantly, you are not a bad and horrible person! You are not worthless!** I recommend seeing a therapist or psychologist to help you recover a healthy sense of self-worth. Don't internalize those untrue and hateful comments about you. Anyone who'd judge a person based on how they come across on reality TV clearly has very few brain cells - their opinion should be discarded. You know you're not just ""some airhead"" - why believe other people's lies?

I'm really sorry, OP. I hope things get better for you."
I want to give that guy a hug 
"It's 40 weeks, that's closer to 10 months. Might hurt the baby? How might oysters hurt the baby? You don't even know. 

Do some real research. Don't grab a list of ""Foods pregnant women should avoid"". Research exactly how oysters *could* damage a fetus, and what conditions would have to be present for them to do so.

I don't think you're going to find what you think you're going to find. You should do this with every single item you want your GF to quit. How much, in what quantity, in what trimester, is the foodstuff safe. When is it unsafe. Be able to answer both questions. When you have actual facts maybe you can have a real conversation with her.

But remember, she's a human being first and foremost, and a baby incubator second. And ""It's only 9 months"" is not a reasonable argument.
"
"&gt; Would it be entitled to ask her to maybe skip some of our traditional activities, so I know which ones I could show up to until I move past my feelings for her?

Wowwwwww. You clearly haven't learned anything from this huh. Also, you mention quite a few times how tough this has been for you, playing my tiny violin for you. You made your bed dude, time to lie in it. She is free to see whatever friends she wants and so are you. Use this as a learning experience. "
"You mean, she’s prioritizing her wants over the child, just like how you prioritized your wants over her when you talked her into having a baby she didn’t want? "
"If you can’t be a good friend to them because of your feelings, you might have to accept that you’ll lose them as friends. There’s really no other way around it. "

"Yeah, I will give them a call when they reopen and see what they say\-\-thank you!"
"I am SO sorry that you went through this.

You aren’t crazy. You have every right to be upset, this is appalling on both counts. IMO the fact he didn’t stop constitutes as a sexual assault, I don’t know the exact legality surrounding this but I would absolutely look into taking this further.

It’s disgusting that you were treated so badly by a medical professional, even if you WERE dependant on or addicted to pain meds that is absolutely no excuse for a doctor to be so heavy handed, especially in such a delicate area after clearly sustaining an injury. I would absolutely make a formal complaint against that person."
"He didn’t initiate any of that though? She made the cake and it sounds like they’d have been doing the rest of the stuff anyway. 

As I’ve said and many seem to agree- you do not need to discuss in advance that you expect some recognition of your birthday. Preferences sure, but again it seems like she would have liked any recognition. "
"OP should refuse to go with Ray IF she can accept that taking that stand will inevitably result in hurt feelings and conflict on multiple fronts, and she wants to do it anyway because of how strongly she feels about not having the baby named after a racist grandpa.

"&gt; Deciding whose hobbies are better/more worthwhile is gatekeeping, pretentious crap.


No fucking shit!  Maybe I'm old, but I actually remember when it *wasn't* cool to play video games.

"Personally I wouldn't consider looking into a mirror a very good hobby, but some people do it.  Have you ever seen some of those makeup artists on youtube? They generally practice on themselves, whilst looking into mirrors.  

Actors/actresses/newscasters etc also often stare at themselves in the mirror to practice facial expressions.  "
"Traditions are only worthwhile when everyone involved is happy to carry it on. Otherwise it's not really a tradition, just an obligation. Both parents get unlimited vetos of baby names, and that includes middle names, so I think it's fine for you to say no to this."

"Yea and it was so unexpected too. She was in her late 40s and had been clean since her late teens. One week her long time bf up and ghosted her, just moved out and disappeared and then her sponsor died (of old age) a week later. Within 1 month she was using again. I tried to help, would take her needles and flush her stash every time I saw her. I ended up stepping back because she was pretty upset with me trying to help and started to get violent. I found out she od'd and died about a month later. Before her relapse she was the poster child for AA (she hated NA and went to AA instead because same concept) because she had been clean for so long. I still smell her perfume randomly and think of her all the time and this happened over a decade ago."
"&gt;  I want some time from the relationship to reflect. I won’t be messing around with other women, and I hope you can do be same, and I hope we can get back together

Boy, bye.

This is so disgusting to say and even worse because it followed a long lecture about your perceived faults. And he kissed your forehead? EW. Sounds like he's trying to ""teach"" you how to be better for him, which is not something you do to someone you respect.

&gt; how could you go back to someone who’s stated all those things about you, you know?

You don't. This guy is a condescending jackass and you can do way better than someone who thinks they have the right to dictate your behavior after breaking up with you in the most patronizing way ever."

"&gt; I love my body and love the attention I get 

Be wary of growing emotionally attached to this attention, because appearances change over time and if you become accustomed to the attention and it wanes as you age, you might not like how it makes you feel when you stop receiving that attention.

HE DID DO SOMETHING WRONG. Your dream has NOTHING to do with any of this. He initiated sexual contact without your consent. That’s pretty fucking bad. "
"He feels like the kind of father that would call taking care of his own child ""babysitting"" I'm in my first year of a three year graduate program and could not imagine having a baby in the middle of everything else - it wouldn't be fair to me and it wouldn't be fair to the child. You can't do your best in school while having a child, and you owe it to yourself to see this opportunity through. You have so many years ahead to have children.  And I do have friends with much younger siblings who are close to them - it does take more of an effort - but it's not impossible. "
"No, it's not fair. You guys should be sharing household duties. You're both busy people and you deserve to have a partner, not a ""benefactor."" Your husband is being a clueless POS."
"Alternatively, you can have a joint account where all monies are “ours” and build a budget including discretionary spending for both parties. "
"It sounds like he's treated her with nothing but respect, and you don't generally tell everyone everything about yourself right off the bat. While it's definitely something to think about, it sounds like he is working to improve himself. Sure, it's fair if OP doesn't want to deal with his baggage, but if he has treated her well so far, I don't think there's any reason to break it off. Just stay wary as the relationship develops into the future."
"You need to leave ASAP. So many young women get stuck with losers like this guy really seems to be (33, lives with his parents, has a child that he probably isn't involved with). Don't become one if those women and regret it later.  Seriously, don't waste any more of your time on him. "

"You're over 18. Unless you're a danger to yourself or others, it shouldn't be legal to commit you to a psych ward against your will. Please get yourself out of this toxic situation.

"This is a really fun thing about being a smart girl, when men meet you and assume you're just some dumb girl who's just pretty and airheaded and only cares about shopping or make up or something - I evilly love when I meet men who treat me like that because I know I'm smarter than them AND they underestimate me, do mansplaining etc. So satisfying having some guy droning on dumb shit about physics or whatever when they clearly only ever read some pop science book, thinking he's sounding so clever and thinking you're swooning over his big man brain, only to utterly eviscerate him intellectually with a well timed question that leaves him stuttering. I know it sounds horrible, but there are so many men I've found who probably don't even consider themselves sexist at all, but who believe on a very fundamental maybe subconscious level that they are innately more intelligent than any woman, and they make it so very clear that they think this way, it's important I think to give these people a challenge to their assumptions."
Her parents really didn't do her any favours :(
"There clearly IS a problem if hes thinking after a light scar youre just going to leave him.


He's probably thinking you're into young and attractive guys and now that he has the scar he feels insecure about it.

Do not have more children. You have the right to say NO forever. Your husband clearly doesn’t respect your opinion on this and frankly I’m side eyeing the fuck out of him on the adoption thing.
"In addition to her saying no, and your lie about the action, there is a very paternalistic, kind of creepy vibe to what you did here. Like you feel you know better, or that you feel like you have to take care of her. Think a little about your actions in that regard, maybe you are taking out her agency a bit with this action."
She told you no and that she is responsible for herself. By disrespecting that you’re infantilizing her. Calm her down? That is just so... she is upset because you did something you told her not to and you ask how to “calm her down and make her forget” the thing she asked you not to do? I don’t think you two are compatible. You sound like you treat her like a child. 
"I see the issue being she was adamant he doesn't help her, and he went against her explicit wishes. Yeah, he did a nice thing but didn't respect what she wanted at the end of the day. "
Not to mention he knows how hard the pregnancy was on her and still won't believe the pregnancy was too hard.
Ask him if it's just current age and situation that has him in this mind set of is that a never wants to get married thing. If it's an age/situation thing then you can decide if that's reasonable for you and you can wait for a while.  If he never wants to get married then you are incompatible and it isn't worth continuing hoping he will change his mind 
"Wow well, this is intense. I would only recommend one thing- talk it out. Ask her about him and see how she reacts. There are many sings that would help you find out if she’s a cheater."
"&gt; You should also document everything just in case. Do not allow his back of boundaries to affect your work environs.

I do agree that she should document things and communicate via email as much as possible just in case this continues and gets worse."
"Seriously. We aren’t supporting you anymore, don’t work, find someone else to mooch off besides us. Oh and BTW, you owe us for your entire life. "
"Some people see children as an investment. A lot of people do. 
It is sad, but that is the ugly truth. 

Think about it. 
Parents don't normally plan to have a child for the child's best interest. They do it for their own interest. Sure after the child is born they begin to show interest on them, but normally it is a parent's own interest that led to it. People have children for multiple selfish reasons: 
1. To create a stronger bond or show that they have a strong bod with their partner. One of the biggest steps of being in a committed in a relationship.
2. Labor or benefits of income. This is still common in modern times. In farms ect. When I say benefits of income I am referring to the government assistance which sadly many people abuse it by having children. Sucks but it is still prevalent. 
3. Parents want some one to take care of them when they get old. 


Don't get me wrong there are people out there who are fully aware and want to bring a baby into the world just because and they can be good parents, but lets not deny the fact that they are not considered an investment. (or even an asset which is even worst)"
"I think there are several components to your post but the main (and most troubling thing I’m hearing) is that is seems like it is u versus them (ur wife and MIL)

1.  In terms of the vacation rental if your wife refuses to not go can you plan an alternative trip as well, with just your nuclear family?  I would make it amazing to show your wife an alternative.

2. Can you find alternative day care for your kids or minimize ur dependence on ur mil in any way?  Right now it seems like ur indebted to her- the less power this women has the better! I don’t know what the specifics are of ur situation but maybe put other rules in place as well to limit your exposure to her.

3. If you hear your mil abusing your wife talk to ur wife about it in the moment.  Call her out when it happens and address bad behavior immediately.

4. If your MIL talks badly to you ignore her, do not give this women any more power or swat over your life.  If she tries to dictate rules for your kids put ur foot down and tell her that is not how things work in your home.

I think most importantly you need to go to therapy with your wife ASAP and express ur unhappiness with your current arrangement.  You need her to have ur back and support."
"It's normal to be attracted to other women, it's human instinct. As long as you don't act on them, it doesn't matter. When single, you find women attractive just because you  get into a relationship, it doesn't mean you suddenly see other people as unattractive"
"Adding to someone's suggestion of telling her she's getting the Family Rate - have your quoted ""family rate"" be (at least close to) what you'd actually charge a normal client. If you work for less than you're happy with, the work is a drag at best - not to mention having to work with family you're not close to, which adds its own complications. 

Also, write up a contract that confirms exactly how much she's paying you, when she's paying you (50% up front at least - though I'd suggest it all up front), when she will get the completed work, and how many revisions/edits she's allowed to make (3-5 rounds of revisions maximum is normal, imo). Email it to her in an editable format and ask her to send it back to you signed and agreed to. You are a professional, so don't be afraid to act like one. Don't apologize for the contract or the cost - act like she's a reasonable person who of course is going to pay you for your services (""Hey Kay, I'd be happy to do this for you - and you'll get the family rate of $xxx for what you're after. I've attached a contract for you to read over and sign - just send it back to me signed and we can get started on this design! :)) and if she pushes back, she'll be the one looking unreasonable and petty.

Honestly though, unless the money you'd be getting from this work would make or break you, I might just ""be too busy to take this project on, unfortunately"" if I were you - but whatever you choose, good luck! "

"Have you been seeing other guys after you dumped him, because expect that to come up if you have. It's possible he'd be willing to try again if you tell him everything you've told us, and maybe set some boundaries this time for frequency of communication so you can mitigate the neediness issue, but it's going to sound a lot worse to him if you say ""Well, I had to dump you and date a bunch of other dudes to realize how good you are.""

"In India, people start their medical degree at 18/19. It's not pre med, it's your bachelor in medicine. Your viewpoint is incredibly US centric."

"I assume you mean he left at some point in the past, not that he literally ran away when you brought up the subject with him."
"Haha what an absolute loser. At least he’s self-aware about it, I guess "
I swear some of the people here have never done a day's manual work in their lives. The fact that they think anyone could stand near a car while it's being hosed and not get wet is laughable.
"This, I was fully prepared to tell OP to cut him some slack, but no, he refused to apologize and instead argued his point."
"They just got home two weeks ago. It would be one thing if it were two months, but not two weeks. That's no time to adjust to a home routine."
Why can’t he just bring a few of his favorite pieces?  Why is it a matter of all of it or none of it?
"&gt; This is your real issue. You're insecure and have self-esteem issues. Getting a boob job won't help you with this issue.

Agreed. OP, I've had a boob job. There's nothing wrong with getting one, if you don't like your body you have the power to change it. But in your case, it doesn't sound like you wanted to get it done before. If they weren't bothering you before, don't let them now. It' doesn't sound like your problem is your breasts, it's how much you are comparing yourself to your sister.

That said you may see hers and decide you love them and they would look great on you. If that's the case,  go for it. But do it because you would like them for yourself, not because you are afraid others will compare you without them."
"The most popular way for exfriends of mine to cheat on their spouses was to simply pick someone up, either at a bar or bookstore in her case.

Because that way, ""there's no proof it happened"".

How about you ask your gf about it? Whoever it was, if they made it up you should find out why. "
"Sploosh. Good job buddy, she'll love it. "
I believe you. My perspective is fuelled from having seen a family decide to forgive a perpetrator and keep having him over for Sunday meals and expecting the victim to forgive because everyone else has. To me that's just wrong.
I'd definitely go with the tie unless you notice that the coach has shirts with French Cuffs! 
"Seconding this. OP, good news: You don't have to go to your Dad's wedding! He can be as upset about it as he pleases. You don't have to go. You don't have to buy him a gift. You don't have to support, or pretend to support, something that you're (quite reasonably, IMO) against."
"It's great that you have been able to build a life doing what you want without many of the rules, but just because you choose not to follow them day to day doesn't mean that they don't need to be considered. 

The fact is, jeans and a vans shirt don't look ""professional"". If you're going to be in business for yourself, you need to learn that sometimes you have to follow the rules other people follow. "
It sounds like part of it may be that he's fixated on the fact that he's attracted to them. Like the fact that he views the attraction as wrong or perverse is making him more aware of it and causing him to obsess about it instead of just letting the idea pass by.
"Your boyfriend is being an immature ass.

It's not your job to pressure him to do shit he expresses that he doesn't want to do. It's your job to listen to him and respect his expressed wishes, which was to not go.

If he needed an extra push, he should have asked for it in the moment.

Tell him that he's acting like a child, and if he wants to continue to be in a relationship with you he needs to pull himself together and stop acting like you are responsible for his decision making and take adult responsibility for his own actions."
"The only problem with OFW is that it's $100 for a year subscription, and if he's being difficult then he might not pay for that. My husband's ex has been court-ordered to pay it and she still won't. "

Too bad.  He's an adult, adults have chores.

STOP doing that. YOU don't want to do the chores either, but guess what, they have to be done.  He DOES NOT deserve praise for doing the bare minimum.  
  
Also, he might, MIGHT have a leg to stand on if you actually had the traditional arrangement, but since you went back to work his position is completely indefensible.

"There's a huge difference between parents leveraging professional/social connections to get you in contact with the right people and indiscriminately blasting out nonsensical/rambling/inaccurate messages on your behalf that make it look like a) you are so incompetent that you need your father to job hunt for you, b) you have zero understanding of professional norms, c) you have no idea how to structure a proper resume, d) anyone who hires you is signing up for inviting nightmare helicopter parents into their place of work, and d) you are comfortable lying on your resume (if anyone checks up on the inaccurate information OP's dad haphazardly included).

OP's dad is turning her into a bad-job-candidate story that hiring managers will laugh over at happy hour (or, if they know who her dad is though the professional grapevine, gossip about). This kind of thing can destroy your professional reputation and your ability to work in your field. OP's dad is cutting her career off at the knees before she even has a chance to start it."
"By your own admission he wasn't sober at the time, just on and off again. It is quite possible he had lapses there and has no desire to temp fate. Either way this is an issue between your sister and him and you should sty out of it unless she specifically asks you to get involved. "
Ok but on and off again is not considered legit “sobriety”. 
It's gonna be a big fucking deal when he can't make it happen every time now and starts to wonder why....
Agreed 100%. I could never date a man who was okay with the fact that they might be raping an underaged sex trafficking victim. 
I think it's time her mom got involved with the community or played cards with some of the other empty-nesters in the neighborhood. Or she could get a dog.

But in the end you have a choice between having a hard conversation about how you'd prefer more oral, fingering, toys, or whatever; or lying about it and hoping the truth never comes out.  It may take a little more foresight and willingness to confront an uncomfortable topic than some people have, but there's clearly a better choice between the two."

"It doesn't sound like you are ready for a commitment like getting engaged. When you marry someone it is (supposed to be) for life. As in, both of you are going to get old together. You'll both get wrinkles, things will start to sag, one or both of you might gain weight. If you have kids, she'll gain weight and get stretch marks. One or both of you may get sick and that could negatively impact your looks. And I keep mentioning *both* of you, because your looks will change too. 

What I'm getting at is, beauty is temporary. Marriage is, ideally, permanent and you shouldn't promise to love someone and be faithful to them if you don't genuinely mean that. Or if you only mean it with the caveat ""so long as you're beautiful"" because if you don't think she's attractive enough *now* then what are the chances you'll feel any different when she's showing signs of aging?

Do you think you're ready for a commitment because you genuinely love your girlfriend and don't want to build a future without her in it...or are you considering it because it seems like everyone else your age is doing it and you feel like you should too?

Thing is, you shouldn't be thinking ""this is my third most attractive girlfriend, I could find someone more attractive"" about the person you're considering marrying (or at least heading in that direction). You should be thinking ""out of all the girls I've dated, this is the one I want to spend my life with. I don't want anyone else""

Side note: do you think you are her most attractive boyfriend? How would you feel if she measured you against her exes in the same way? "

"I feel sad because this is supposed to be such a great trip. We're supposed to be on the road by Friday and since my BF has a week off work, he's staying there until next Friday. It's apparently a lovely house in his hometown where we'll be having fun with his friends and family.

I don't think my BF will be angry. I think he'll be disappointed and confused because he wants me to meet his friends and wants us to have a great time. But you're not the first person to tell me to see my BF's reaction if I tell him I don't wanna go... 😢 I feel so horrible about going with his friend though. I don't think I want to be on the road for hours with him."
You are not unreasonable.  He is being irresponsible.
"I think asking for permission to marry you is outdated and sexist, but asking for your parents' (both parents') blessing is a kind and sweet thing to do. It shows that he cares about them and wants to include them in the family he's forming with you.

Think of it this way: would you be insulted if your boyfriend let his parents know that he bought a ring and was planning to propose soon? He already knows your parents and, presumably, his parents, are excited and happy for the two of you. He's just giving them a heads up."
"She DID have to get over you, though. The difference is that she had to do it all while being desperately starved for your affection and still in the relationship... Her getting over you ""so fast"" is a direct result of feeling like she was dying of thirst by your poor treatment. What you are seeing is her finally making it to an oasis after being stranded in an emotional desert in her relationship with you. Can you really begrudge her the happinesses of finding an oasis after dying of lack of affection for so long?"
"I may be out of line here, but maybe your husband could use some therapy.

He obviously loves his job, but it's also clearly obvious he feels as though he's missed out so much on his children growing up. He's a good father and his children love him, but he feels like an *absent* father.

In Scrubs, JD realized that a lot of the home videos he saw of his son were through a camera lens and not him being physically present and this seems to be taking a toll on him. A similar feeling has happened to some of my old high school friends who are/were in the military as parents...

The best solution is therapy and letting him come to conclusions he feels he can live with; forcing him to see his job as an ""envious"" position won't help long term."

It's all good. I was being a bit extreme for the comedy. 
"&gt;She's trying to make you feel like a bad guy so you take it back

To offer a more optimistic view, a lot of people aren't taught properly about consent, and she might be feeling genuinely guilty/like a predator now that her behaviour has been called out and not sure where the boundaries lie as what she thought was okay, isn't. Not that I'm saying OP should put up with it AT ALL\-just that she might be responsive to a talk about consent and boundaries.

But if she continues with this manipulative sleeping on the floor/trying to guilt you nonsense then peace out."
"If you fool around with him and then, with knowledge you would always do so, decline to be in a relationship with him, you will have solved your problems with your friend.

Because he will no longer be your friend."
"Sure, but you can say that stuff gently and kindly. Sounds like he made you upset, and then blamed you for having feelings. How awful of him!

For the record, you are allowed to have feelings at any time. The correct response when someone you are having sex with starts crying is to stop immediately, ask them what's wrong, and comfort them and make sure everything is okay. That is what humans do. Is he a robot? It sounds like he may be a robot."
"Exactly ! Op needs to work on valuing herself because there’s no excuse for him to talk to her rudely, especially during sex. She shouldn’t be blaming herself and I’m not sure if this is just how she is or if this is something the boyfriend has instilled into her. "
There's a 99% chance he will get attached to you no matter what because you'll be his first. I think you might just be attracted to the idea or the taboo of it but if your willing to risk the friendship go for it.
"Dude, a few tears are making you overlook the fact that she scammed up this HUGE con because she was miffed that you didn't wait on her when she was sick??? **SHE IS CRAZY.** Grow a backbone and LEAVE."
That book is actually 100% relevant to this conversation? The entire message of the book is trust your gut. 
"Wait, what? She just wants to sext a bit and get her ass smacked lol. "
"To be blunt, this is something you’re going to have to deal with going forward. Wondering if you’re “the token woman” is not helpful and yes, will happen from time to time. Don’t concern yourself with it, just continue to do good work and show that you are in fact a valuable employee regardless of gender, which it sounds like you did. (So says another woman in a male dominated, STEM job)"
"Not just that, but she didn’t drink but also didn’t complain about paying for everyone else’s drinks! Pretty shocking behaviour from her friends, we always chip in extra if we were drinking and friends weren’t."
"Damn. That’s rough to read OP. I’m a husband and my wife makes more money than I do. We both have 8-5 jobs and when I see her exhausted I don’t ask anything of her. I just try to make her happy. No kids though. 

Marriage is a co-op thing. No one should be doing everything. I can feel the resentment through your post because I’d feel the same way if my wife said that shit to me. 

Ask him why he thinks he’s so entitled to not doing chores, helping out around the house, and everything else on your mind. 

At the same time it sounds like that conversation is a ticking time bomb. My best piece of advice is have a really calm conversation. If he can’t have a grown up conversation then just stop, and say “I’m not having this discussion unless you can be reasonable” - if he reacts poorly to that then I’m not sure what to tell you. You shouldn’t have to convince your husband to help you out. I mean my god you just carried a baby around for 9 months. 

I actually enjoy making my wife happy on the days she’s feeling really down. Like yesterday. We were both mentally in the dumps. I said “hey what do you want to do RIGHT now...” (this was at 8pm at night). She said all she really wanted was some fro-yo! I jumped up and said get in the car because we’re getting some Fro Yo! 

Your husband needs a serious reality check here. 

Good luck. "
"Consider the position he is in now, and where he's come from.

It's possible that he's extending the behaviour he had from his previous relationship onto your interactions. He's probably being affectionate because he doesn't have a frame of reference on how to act differently with someone he's having sex with.

You'll only know if this is the case if you have a discussion with him. Maybe he's doing it because he wants a relationship, or simply because this is the only way he knows how to act with someone he's physically intimate with.

It's time to talk to him, OP."
"I seem to be in the minority here, but it doesn’t seem to me as if either of them was really there to sleep with the other one *specifically.* Yes, it was still a crappy choice, but it sounds like he was miserable without you and her husband had just cheated on her as well. She told him to give you a call so he could get back together with you. He was clearly afraid that wouldn’t pan out.

Yes. It was crappy. But neither of them went looking for it, and both of them went out of their way to make sure they didn’t end up in similar situations again or come even close to crossing the line when you two got back together.

I know it hurts, and it hurts a *lot.* But I think it was way more about their own hurt than anything else, and it was done at a time when everyone thought you and he were done."
"Why would your situation matter to her feelings? Is she not allowed to be upset because you and your family never took a vacation? 

That just seems like you want to shut down the conversation and dismiss her feelings. Regardless of how trivial you think her emotions are, they are still her emotions and they are valid. Smh"
"Your wife is recovering from having a baby. She is full or hormones designed to help her bond with and protect that baby. It is not her job to be respectful to your family right now, especially because they are the type of family that think staying with you for two weeks straight every four weeks is acceptable.

Your normal meter is definitely broken.

Your wife needs to find her feet as a new mother. Stop inviting your family over unless you will be there to buffer the visit 24/7.  No more going to work and leaving your wife alone with your family.  They are causing drama and it's not your wfie's job right now to smooth it over. Your wife is fucking busy trying to figure out how to be a mother. She needs space.

I can understand you feel sad your family doesn't get as much time with your baby, but that is the reality of the situation when they live four hours away. Accept it and stop making your wife do the work to equal the playing field. YOUR family is your wife and child now, you have to work in THEIR best interests."
"A half aunt (half sibling of your parent) would share with you about the same amount of DNA as a first cousin: 12.5%. 

A half sibling would share about 25%. I don't know what DNA service you used, but look at the amount of DNA shared (often expressed in centimorgans, but sometimes in percentages like above) and then Google ""ISOGG autosomal DNA statistics"" to figure out the probable relationship. While these are approximate amounts of DNA, it's really easy to distinguish between a half aunt and a half sibling. 

Once you figure it out, maybe that will help you decide what to do. I err on the side of truth, but it's worth saying that it's not just your secret. It's possible your sister/aunt doesn't want any part of this or will do the reveal herself, which - fortunately or unfortunately - is something you can't stop."
"Then he needs to leave her so she can get the one-on-one she needs &amp; wants. If he's not willing to do that for her &amp; make compromises like she did for him 8 years ago, he's being hypocritical and she deserves some emotional &amp; sexual reciprocation now that she's in a better place."
But it is his problem. It's both of their problem because it's effecting their relationship. A marriage is 50/50 and they need to communicate and work together to fix it. I agree what she's doing is wrong and hurtful but it's a great thing that he wants to help her feel more secure. 
"Yesssss. My ex never did anything around the house. I felt like a maid. If he did the dishes, he was doing me a favor. Current fiancé, one day I said “When I have to ask you to do the dishes I feel like you assume it’s my responsibility and that doesn’t feel equal to me. I can’t be in a relationship where we don’t share house chores.”

Literally have never mentioned it again. If I cook he always does the dishes. And I always say thank you. 

He’s a keeper. "

"Sorry about R! You're doing the right thing. 

My sister had a beautiful chestnut filly that had been struck by lightning. Horse had bad PTSD. Never got over it. Used to do the craziest, most dangerous shit at the most unexpected of times. Like, she'd be quietly standing there, tied up, half asleep, and go completely ballistic for no reason. Sis sold her to a teenager. I'm sure that horse hurt that teen, and probably eventually ended up in a slaughter house. In retrospect, I wish my sister had had the courage to put that horse down. She should have died in the home she knew, surrounded by the people who loved her. Would've been harder for us, but much kinder for the horse (and that poor teen who bought her). 

There are more horses available than ever enough homes for them. Even good horses end up in slaughter. Problem horses have little hope whatsoever. Because of this, I commend you for putting your horse down. He'll leave this world with you loving on him (and crying on him). Not trembling in a slaughter house that smells of blood, surrounded by strange people."
"Okay first of all, friendzoning isn't a thing, it's only in your head. It's super sexist and stupid, so congrats on that.

Secondly, please point out where I made fun of your hobbies. I watch movies and anime too. I'll wait.

Third, you specifically said:

&gt;by inconciderate i meant she still acts normal even after seeing me be quite sad and uncomfortable about her being normal

So how, in your mind, is she supposed to be acting?"
lol fuck this dude. Lock him in The Hague.
"Well, she has a point. It's a strained muscle. You're not even in the hospital anymore. She knows you're going to be okay. If you're upset because you're bored and lonely... she has a life, too. Even if it's just eating at iHop. There is no obligation for her to come by and entertain you, even if it would be nice, and even if it seems like she should. 



"
"I think this is a bit weird of a question to ask but yes, I think you owe her that. It'd never be something I'd admit to a partner, but great relationship sacrifices should be repaid and it's pretty much a given expectation. 

For example, I'm planning on studying in Spain to be with my partner if possible, though it looks like I will have to do my not-first-pick degree, which I was working towards in the US. If that happens, I'd be staying with my partner who would financially support me (food, rent, bills, etc.) and also pick me up from Uni.

I'd be pretty upset in your girlfriend's shoes if you weren't willing to do the same back that she does for you. And no, she didn't have to make the sacrifice, but it does make you a bad person if you don't reciprocate it and then go ""but it was your choice!"" "
"I wouldn't cancel, but if you really must I'd just tell the truth. Lying and making up excuses won't help anything in the long run. Maybe go on the date, try to have a good time and don't sweat it. I know it's not that easy, but it may be the best plan of action."

"The snoring is a separate medical issue. The fact he gets pissed and annoyed with you for wanting a good nights sleep is another. The medical issue can be fixed if he really wanted to. The moodiness and selfishness is much harder.

He sounds like a jerk, so i'd dump him and get your bed back then get a good nights sleep.

Fwiw, my ex husband was a snorer too and did nothing about it. I moved him into another bedroom for what i blamed on his snoring, but i realized i was happier without sleeping next to him, because of the snoring and because i didn't like him anymore. It was the beginning of the end of our relationship. "
"&gt; Apparently, never wore a wedding ring

... This doesn't at all strike you as evidence that your boyfriend might maybe be lying? Like, if she were horribly abusive and he was being forced into things he didn't want and ran away as soon as he could manage it, he'd have been wearing the ring out of fear of the potential consequences. Whereas if he felt perfectly safe and secure going around ring-less, continuously and aggressively insulting his wife with the implication that she doesn't deserve real commitment ... doesn't that sound a lot more like *he's* the one who was being manipulative and abusive? Doesn't that maybe suggest, possibly, that his ex is trying to convince the children to stay away from him because *she's afraid he'll hurt them too*? "
"&gt; i don’t think he’d correct them in private.

Get yourself a man who would. 

Him doing something and him doing nothing says more about this situation than anything. I've had one friend say something racist around my best friends (he's white) fiance (she's black). He took that friend aside later in the night and talked to them about how it wasn't OK. Friend apologized to his fiance in private stating ignorance and she accepted the apology. He didn't make a scene, but what he did wasn't hard to do, he just did what was right. It was so simple.   You can't prevent other people from being racist or saying something racist but you can partner yourself with a man who respects POC enough to correct his friends when they're being asshats. "
So you hadn't told him until she confronted you. 
I'm definitely not going to speak to my sister for some time. She's my sister though and i love her to death so no ofcouse she isn't tossable. That's what i told him.. I've been highly intoxicated in the past and never once did i kiss anybody. This is all just fucked.

He's  not attracted to him and never has been. Has to watch porn in able to have sex with him. He deserves someone that at minimum finds him attractive. He mostly likely married him because it was comfortable and they're young.
"And if you joke back, suddenly you're insulting *the manager*!"
"&gt; She has been cheated on in prior relationships

Okay, then that at least why she's going a bit overboard here. Other commenters have noted that you did this after starting a new job (a common time when infidelity start), and that you didn't tell her that you did it (she discovered it), but given that she knows your pass code and you have a good reason to have one, I think the fact that she has been cheated on in the past is the reason for her behavior here. I'm not saying you should stay in a trustless relationship where you're being constantly harassed for doing non-red flag things, but understanding that you aren't and haven't done any wrong, and that is her personal struggle, and not taking it personally is the key to working through this (assuming you're serious about this relationship and would like to spend the rest of your life with her if this issue is resolved). You can't fix this for her, or make her believe, but you should let her know how her mistrust is making you feel, and that this had to be resolved one way or another. Hopefully that will motivate her to either shit or get off the pot."

"Just throwing this in there, but OP when you mention 5 kids I would add ‘and X (number) are teenagers’ and/or ‘the youngest is 8’. I would think that would make the number of kids sound far less intimidating than just leaving it at the number. Dating someone with older kids is far different than dating someone with younger kids.

But you will gripe incessantly.
"
"Ok, so I do not think you're overreacting and the other commenters have pointed out a lot of things that your wife is doing wrong. Here I am with the other side! 


-Living in a country where you don't speak the language and being away from your family is difficult and isolating

-Having a partner who is injured and cannot help out is tough

-Having 2 kids under 2 is BRUTAL, especially if you'd prefer not to be a stay-at-home parent but have no other choice

-The fact that you say this behavior is new in the past few months and that your youngest must be quite young to have 2 under 2 makes me wonder about PPD


She's in a really, really tough spot. That doesn't excuse being totally disconnected form financial reality or being mean to you about an injury, but it is something to seriously consider. I'd sit down, say you've noticed her reacting differently than normal, and see what's up.

It's also like.... theyve been together 5 years and NOW he decides to leave? 

It's the worst possible time for that"
"&gt;Then, if she chooses to go to HR herself and asks me to support her story, I can do so.

Make sure you tell her that. Just a simple ""here's another vm. Again, I will not be talking to anyone about this.

She may not have said anything thus far because she believes she's on her own and will alienate herself. Abusers are very good at making people feel that way. "
"It sounds a bit like how colorism can work in the US, where light-skinned African-American families can take on a ""project"" of trying to look more white. Sometimes this takes the form of pushing members to only date lighter people or abusing darker-complexioned family members for being more obviously of African origin. When you look at the long history of horrific racism and the fact that passing as white could be a (still terribly dangerous) escape, it makes sense, but like a lot of reactions to long-term trauma, it gets taken out on the family. 

OP, I'm sure you're lovely. Rock that curly hair and dark skin. Your family is abusing you out of their own trauma and self-hatred, and you can pity them, but you cannot let their abuse define your self-worth."

"It’s not your job to be her parent, even though you seem to have assumed this role. You sit her down at home, and tell her what your issues are and why in regards to her behaviour. Tell her how her behaviours (getting to close to things, ect) at the museum for example made you feel. But again, it’s not your job to correct her. She’s going to be the way she is, unless some event or something else makes her want to change those behaviours. Maybe she’s actually completely oblivious to how you feel about it and would have tried, had instead you confronted the issues this way instead of just correcting her like a child. Because she’s not a child. She’s somehow gotten through college and got a good job and had friends and past relationships without always having a ‘guardian’ going around and correcting her, even when she’s animated in public and people give her dirty looks. She obviously has no issue with this behaviour, nor does care what bystanders think about it. And that’s fine for her. It’s just not fine with you. And that’s ok. "

Trouble is short of becoming a ""nag"" and calling him out every single time, I'm not sure what your options are.

"It’s not logical, but at that age when my parents were divorcing my mom asked me if I would be comfortable with her dating again.

"do not waste your time or your youth on a man who doesn't want to marry you. In my experience, when a man wants to marry you, he wants to get that assurance ASAP. There is nothing wrong with wanting to have educational and financial goals in place before marriage but if he wanted to marry you, he'd *also* have it in place that you have agreed to be his wife; he'll have asked you and you'd be at least engaged at this point. He won't even consider it until the fall? Pffffft. You need to consider falling back on this relationship or maybe even ending it altogether. At the very least stop giving him wife privileges (such as living together, sharing finances, etc.) and dial things back to just dating. That is the level of seriousness he is at while here you are ready to be this man's wife. Nope! Refuse to be his placeholder until he finds another woman he does want to marry. 

Release him, release yourself to find a man who feels strongly about you and has a sense of urgency about you. Your current boyfriend can take you or leave you, sounds like. You want a man who has to have you and will not want to see you walk out that door, one who will throw the gauntlet down and claim you as his wife."
You don't get a vote here. You can support her decision or you can move on. 
Jesus Christ this posts infuriate me. Come on OP have some self fucking respect. She was having unprotected sex ON YOUR BED! By the way if she cheated once she’ll do it again eventually she does not deserve you. Can’t believe you’re really willing to “work it out”. There is no working it out OP.

"&gt; no longer feeling as worn out and tired throughout the day like he used to.




YEP. That in it's own was worth the money for CPAP/APAP for us.




Husband was otherwise constantly irritable in the morning, tired and used to act fairly selfish in little things (like making espresso just for himself and breakfast just for himself - since lack of sleep narrows your definition of what's important to you; whereas I'd always make both of us espresso and breakfast if I got up earlier than him).

"People asking if the dude knows about it, do you even know the anger that arises from being cheated on? Try to keep things in perspective, and realize that not everyone are as pristine and sanctimonious like our fellow redditors. Not everyone can take the ""Forgive and Forget"" route, and some of us just want to lash out against them in turn.

Girlfriend cheated, dude breaks up with her, and in a grand act of revenge he slept with her bestfriend. It's like a giant ""FUCK YOU!"". And to have her record it and send it to her? That just makes it sweeter. Some people get really sad and broken hearted, and others just get furious.. One of my ex's cheated on me and I told her I wanted to flay her skin off.  Not uh.. Not my proudest moment 
 (But she had been gaslighting the fuck out of me, so I feel like I had a right to be especially angry). We eventually became friends a year or so later and it came up as a casual joke a few times. "

"I would be careful how you approach telling her all of this, because this might be something about herself that she cannot change. It sounds like this is her personality. Since you said she’s successful in her job, and has friends...I think the only problem here is that you don’t like her. I don’t think she’s the problem. The problem is that you two are not compatible. It doesn’t sound like she’s a strain on society...unless she’s driving dangerously, drinking and driving, being cruel and a bully, or doing something else that could seriously hurt someone else, she’s not really harming anyone. Leave her be, and leave her self-esteem intact so she can go on to meet someone else who will like her for who she is. "

"Why don’t you just tell him? You said you guys are friends, I’m sure you can find a quiet moment to tell him. It’s like when you see someone on public transport with like, I don’t know, their skirt stuck in their underwear. It might be embarrassing for a second whilst you tell them but you know they’re going to be so grateful somebody spared them any further embarrassment.
Just tell him something along the lines of this is a bit awkward to tell you but personally I would rather know so, here it is: it seems like you might suffer from halitosis, have you ever spoken to a doctor about it? 
And then offer to help him by covering his shift or whatever if he needs time off to go to the doctor.
I reckon that if you’re considerate and honest about it, even if he reacts a bit there and then, eventually he can only be thankful. After all it is a medical condition, not something he does on purpose."

"&gt; but the things she lied about have nothing to do with you and don't effect you at all. 

That is simply not true at all. Lying to him for 8 months, lying about how many people, lying about her LTR, lying about her sleeping with a close **friend**. All of these issues concern OP and you just want him to let it all slide because of her being a woman. She isn't above the consequences of lying because of the social ramifications of sleeping around.

She should've been truthful from the beginning and this is totally on her and she needs to earn your trust back, OP.

"Since the other woman always cites her husband as a reason, he should be informed as well.


Everyone should be present to avoid any misunderstanding, also OP should show them she and her husband are a united front. I would not confront the other woman and her husband (since apparently he encouraged his wife to do it) alone.


OP was a bit reluctant to assert herself, as others already have pointed out, and I assume it is because their husbands are coworkers and friends and other people are in that group, too.


Yes, she should be able to tell the wife to stop herself, but it should happen out in the open with witnesses, in this case the indirectly involved husbands. 


I wouldn't trust that other woman to be honest about this situation. If she can't handle polite refusals, how will she react if OP gives her a straight NO?


I would never recommend to stay quiet about unwanted sexual advances. As one other redditor said: Don't give the other woman the chance to blame OP for anything that happened or makenup stories.


Being polite, direct and a united front with the husband seems to be the best way to address it, but you may beg to differ.

"This is a good answer.

"So I don't think we can call it from here; you seem to be considering your family as a single unit, when in reality, there's at least seven distinct people. I do think that dying with the ability to give them advance notice, and choosing not to, would be a grave emotional injury to each and every one of those people, no matter the reason for the estrangement. That's fair for people who were cruel, but maybe not for those who were simply negligent.

I would advise keeping your distance if you had reached out over the years and been rebuffed; but I think you want to think that through with perspective, and try to figure out if there's a spin where they gave you space because you didn't seem to need them, and never built up the habits of closeness.

If you have friends around you, and you have someone you really trust, you could write an advance medical directive, and then reach out to your family but insist that your friend mediate; likewise a good family therapist could mediate some of this, if you prefer to pay a professional.

(Don't discount individual therapy in a palliative context, as you navigate that. An outside perspective on what you leave behind could be very helpful here, especially when it's informed with some of the details.)

It does happen that sometimes a person who seems self-sufficient doesn't make any of the people around them get into the habit of showing caring, and with no pattern of giving and receiving caring, the rift persists. Your parents had an obligation not to treat you like that, but maybe your siblings simply followed their lead and fell into patterns like that."
Ya it sounds like OP is more wrong than right in her SOs opinion that’s why he wants this. I wouldn’t want to be in a relationship where my SO always wants to bring up past conversations where I was wrong on...
You need to stop mothering and enabling  him so that he can actually become self sufficient. He has no reason to see a doctor if you keep rescuing him. Stop. Srsly. It sounds like he’s either taking drugs or has a medical issue.

"Upvoting because I agree with you. I would not go as far to say selfish. But to continue to hold into this information is definitely irresponsible. Op should have immediately contacted her parents to inform then circumstances had changed so that they could start looking into alternative care for her sister. 

Op pregnant and then with a newborn is not going to be in a position to help someone that right now needs all the support she can get.  She is going to be focusing on her pregnancy and then that child will be her priority. 

Call your parents tonight. It is their money that has gone into this home. Tell them what happened and with them decide how to tell your sister. It is too late to back out of the move but I advice to then immediately start looking into new living arrangements for yourselves. "

"It's kind of a misfire of the golden rule. I can guarantee you that this is how it's going in his head. 

You: Make statement about racist behavior
Him: Thinks to a time where he did the racist behavior, but thinks it was for non-racist reasons.
Him: Defends racist behavior to try and absolve his own guilt.

For example my (mixed but white passing) friend moved in to a predominantly mexican neighborhood while she was teaching. Within the first month her house was robbed twice, while she was still unpacking everything. The second time she had a security camera and her neighbors were arrested for the robbery. 

Eventually they came back to the house and she was understandably super jumpy around them until her lease was up and she was able to leave. But every friend she had over who didn't know about the robberies only saw her rushing back inside whenever her neighbors came out. So it started getting around that she just really didn't like Mexicans. 

For like, the next year and a half any time someone brought up racist behavior around her she'd jump in with a defensive devil's advocate argument about how ""You don't know their life!"" Despite our best efforts to point out 'Uh you sound more racist not less when you do that.' Eventually she chilled out though. 

This is all a very round about way of saying your boyfriend has almost definitely engaged in some or all of the behaviors you're listing. But his are different! Because he's not racist obviously! /s "
My post was getting long. I don't think she has a say in it. But we have been arguing so much that I wonder if I'm in the wrong. Or even how/if this relationship is sustainable if gf has such issues.
This is not a reasonable reason to call your gf an asshole.
"You're being overly involved in her day to day decision making, regardless of your pessimism or optimism.  The way you talk about her is as if you're talking about a difficult teenager, not another adult.  I think you, her, and your relationship as a whole would benefit if you took a step back and only gave advice when solicited."
"1. She may feel like she can’t relate to you anymore, as you are experiencing different things in life right now. 

2. The way you are describing your work makes me kind of ‘hate’ you too, but not in a jealousy way. I certainly hope there is some humility when you are with others. "
This honestly sounds to me like escalating domestic abuse. It starts often with things like you've described. I'd run for the hills.
How much were you texting her when she was at work? I hate it when people want to chat with me all day while I’m working. At work. Doing work. 
"Please be careful how you discuss these things with her and try to be gentle.  I’m early in my pregnancy and already it does start to feel like you’re very out of control of your own body, and everyone is trying to tell you what to do.

Your concerns are valid but you need to work on your approach with her. "

You doubt she shaved OP's dog on purpose? What, you think she tripped and shaved all of a thick coat apart from the head and a bit of tail on a big dog? Just... WOOPS! accidentally made a dog bald. 

To go from washing and brushing to shaving is not an accident. Yeah, she may have not known the damage that shaving can do to a double coat dog. But thats like going to a hairdressers to wash and dye your hair and coming out bald. 

Even if you are a trainee for weeks you LISTEN TO THE OWNER and learn some of the damn basics before you start training and at least in the first week. 

This was done on purpose, even if it was not meant to cause harm, it was still done on purpose. "
"Every sexual harasser has friends and a family. A man who sexually harasses a woman might be someone else's dad, brother, son... it doesn't change anything.

Because the wedding is supposed to be a celebration and I don't want to celebrate his relationship."
"I wouldn't offer that, that just keeps the door for money conversations open and could appear really patronising. I mean, if the parents come to OP and ask for advice with their finances then I'd help of course, but otherwise I think a rule of not talking about finances is better given at the moment they just want handouts."
"Girl. How could you do that to your ex? Yeah you two needed to break up but seriously? After 7 years of both of your lives, 7 YEARS, you confess your feelings less then a day after your break up?

Holy crap. I feel so bad for your ex "
"Yes I know, I’ve played d and d. I still would not dream of asking any group I belonged to, to meet less often,  "
we are suckers for drama
"Thank you, thank you, thank you for going to the police.  This guy WILL strike again unless something is done.  For all we know, he's done it before and the woman was too scared to report it, thus allowing the cycle to continue with you and others.

Also, contact RAINN (The National Sexual Assault Hotline).  They are your advocates and will walk you through everything.  800.656.HOPE

It may help to call them first.  It's safe, confidential, and they *will* believe you and help you."
"&gt;I'm not saying do that, but I'm saying you should SAY you will

As an aside, do not ever say this unless you intend to follow through. Yes, it is a drastic step and should be a last resort. But if you have to, do it then follow through. If you don’t, you’ll only be teaching her your ‘no’ means nothing and she’ll know to disregard whatever you say and do what she wants without any regard to you. 

ETA to clarify I meant don’t threaten to call CPS unless you follow through. "
It's only a competition if you're competing with her. Otherwise it's both of you doing what you want. Stop caring about her tendency to be inspired by you and take it as a compliment. Who cares if she spends more on a dress or bedroom set? No one else cares or compares you two. Don't get sucked in. 
"&gt;since you agree there's no rational basis for your anxiety 

OP doesn't say that, though. And when one drinks to excess, worrying about them making it home is a rational concern. "
"I mean if she’s bisexual she will be having sex with other people, her wording is correct. You’re being hostile for no reason. "
Your boyfriend is unreasonable. There is no indication in your ex's behaviour that would imply he's not over you. You aren't even talking to him one on one. 
"My dad is 75 and grew up in super rural redneck North Carolina. I think you give people too little credit. He’s not racist or bigoted, and neither are most of his friends (he’s now a retired Lawyer in a bigger southern city). He might have been a racist or bigot when he was younger- I don’t know- I wasn’t there. But except for an occasional misplaced joke, and probably some lingering deep subconscious bias, he’s golden.

My grandparents lived in the rural south, and do a lot of my family. Grandfather was literally a tobacco farmer. You don’t have to be a racist if you don’t want to be. 

(Of course, my views are based on personal experience, and I can’t speak for the Deep South and am open for someone to change my mind, this is just how I feel. Prob biased)"
No I’m not a 20 year old guy but I am a woman in her 20s who has never had a partner forget their birthday. 
"&gt;Update: The girl sent the video and BF has admitted he was wrong. Where do I go from here.

Dump him anyway, he's insane."
"Yup! You did the right thing OP.

Down the street from me a man knocked on the door and a young women anwsered, he was inquiring about the house being sold next door and was asking about the neighbor. Next thing he does is push her down when he realized she was alone and raped her.

So tell your bf that you had every right to call because people are crazy. Maybe next time have a secret knock that you would recognize as him"
Why would he listen to her? At the core he doesn’t really trust trust her.
"... Reading this I felt this was an ""issue"" faced by someone in their early 20's not almost 30 lol.

Dude. You wanna drop your current GF for the geeky-gamer-chick at your job then go ahead but don't for a min fool yourself into thinking it'll be all roses with this new girl; since ya know, you know next to nothing about her! Think about it, like really think about it. For all you know this new girl already has a boyfriend or has problems with staying faithful or she might find you boring in a relationship (wouldn't that be ironic lol).

This issues seem to be coming more from you. Looks like your relationship has plateaued and you guys are more or less settled. Sounds to me like you need some new excitement in your lives. So why don't you turn off the video games for a hot min and do something with your current GF. Do something new together, learn something together, grow together - or not. I mean you could always dump her and try again with this someone new but more then likely you'll end up here again after a few years since it seems you get bored kinda easy.

Whatever you do DO NOT CHEAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND! If you want this new girl then be man enough to break it off with your current girlfriend and if you're really man enough then you'll do with without any indication that this new girl is even available for you."
It reads to me like OP is trying to guilt him into a response.
"A sincere apology means nothing if it isn’t fixed on some level - in this case, bf should’ve stepped up to the plate once she expressed her disappointment. Picked a restaurant to take her to, find something to do nearby, whatever. Anything. “Oh my god I’m so sorry” means nothing if you just spend the rest of the day continuing to ignore it. "
Don't monkey branch from one relationship to another. If you don't like your current relationship then either work to make it better or break up with her. Don't start talking to another girl you have a crush on while you still have a girlfriend who loves you at home. That's a slimeball move. 
It's not unreasonable to just stop making the lunch. 
"They're not going to be done with demanding money after he gives in to repaying for them raising him as a child.  They're going to demand more money for retirement, medical care, and whatever else they can think up. "
"I'd recommend anything that means you have to talk to one another, rather than sit in silence. Don't go to a movie. Try an art gallery or a museum. Or coffee. Or feed ducks on the local pond.

Why not just ask her what she's into? She's probably capable of telling you.

Language barriers aren't barriers. They're potentially a lot of fun. You have a chance to explore a whole different culture, and pick up the opportunity of being able to converse in a different tongue. Don't look at it as an obstacle. It's an adventure."
"I think you're definitely onto something here.

Your own tentativeness that you described is also part of the same pattern, I think. I totally recognise it in myself too. Maybe we're socialised into thinking we can't be trusted, or that we're going to sound ""b****y"" or ""nagging"" if we're just direct?"
"Definitely not when the attacker is wide awake, at night, has premeditated such an attack, likely has a deadly weapon - or at least can improvise burglary tools like a crowbar into one - and might be looking to commit a home invasion rather than a robbery. No chance at all. /s"
"I generally agree with you, but a middle name probably won't be a 'daily reminder.' Most people's middle names only come up for official forms and things. "
"The idea that she was 'trivializing his responses' is his value judgment. A value judgment that I have no reason to trust, based on his examples.

He said it was humiliating that a friend of his wife didn't say hi to him. ***HUMILIATING.*** C'mon now.

Not only that, he seems to think *his wife* is responsible for other people's behavior \(""the effect seemed to spill over to other people at the event""\).

His wife is acting *a little* rudely. Ok. But he is not reacting to his wife's *actual* rudeness, he is reacting to a scenario that he's made up in his mind, one where his wife and coworkers have decided to make him feel like he is crazy for no reason whatsoever."
"She probably should have decided that before she took on the responsibility for caring for another life, don't you think?"
"Big giant red flags for control issues and over the top jealously. He needs to deal with his own obviously crippling insecurity issues, not take them out on you. Put the wedding on hold, insist he go to counselling to deal with his shit (individual counselling, not couples counselling, this is a ""him"" problem not a ""you guys as a couple"" problem). You are doing nothing wrong and he is behaving unreasonably. He needs to address this issue or you need to really reassess how much of a dealbreaker it is to have a guy try to dictate what you wear and how you look, and to constantly harass you with calls when you are out without him. This is not a healthy relationship dynamic.

I am hesitant to use the word ""abusive"" here, but he is definitely displaying toxic and abusive tendencies. Just because his behaviour is due to his own insecurity and hangups doesn't mean that you don't experience it as abusive. You refusing to accept this situation is not you dismissing his feelings  - it's you telling him he needs to work on and sort out his feelings until they are in a healthy place and not negatively affecting you and your relationship, and that's perfectly fair."
"It's intentional, no one does something like this by mistake or doesn't something like this accidently.
What your finding out is, is that is sweet talk is exactly that just sweet talk and nothing else and has no real substance behind it. 
I would probably say it doesn't matter who your BF is in a relationship with this is how he probably treats them after awhile.

I'm not going to say he's abusive but his behaviour is worrying. This is because it sets up a situation where you see him as being very affectionate with basically anyone but you, and you are seeking his affection where he won't give it.

Let me ask you this, have you ever seen him compliment someone and then tried something similar hoping for a similar compliment. Like you see him compliment a selfie and take your own to see if he'll do the same. 

What I think is going on is your BF just isn't that affectionate of a person, and not very emotional either. However the way he presents himself especially to other women seems that way. 

I would say he either doesn't view his interactions with other women as affection, that's just how interacts with women and in your in a relationship with him so you see more of his actual self, which isn't really that affectionate or emotional.

Or he's trying to cheat on you, and he's doing this so you are seeking his approval rather than looking for anything shady. I would say this is unlikely though. "
Why can't you leave the note if it bothers you this much?
"Right, because dangerous folk plan out their misdeeds and make logical choices. I wouldn't be afraid of a thoughtful murderer, I'd be afraid of some drunk lunatic who has no idea what they're doing. "
WOOPS I misread it as lost. 
"In addition to this, OP. The biggest thing I learned from my abusive relationship is that typically abusers don't do these things consciously. No one wakes up and says, ""I'm going to abuse my SO today."" Often times abusers are objectively *kind* people and will treat others with compassion, they just have massive insecurities that they feel compelled to take out on the people they're closest to.

Many women have a hard time leaving their abusers because no one believed them when they tried to tell others about what was happening behind closed doors. Even my ex was a gentle and kind guy and it took my own family time to really see what was happening. If you're having any doubts about what people have said in this thread, please know that from the outside looking in, you are in a textbook abusive relationship. He may be kind to others or have great qualities, but a *nice* person never treats someone how he treats you.

Edit: a word"
"Honestly, I agree. That, or bringing up the idea of potentially fostering older children. There are a lot of ideas OP could bring up that might work before ending the relationship. "
"She didn't. Typically on Sunday night we have dinner with her family, since i don't have any family anywhere near me anymore. 

I got a really awkward phone call tonight from her parents, asking when are me and my SO going to show up for dinner. I told them to talk to their daughter, and hung up.

"
"&gt; can you see yourself living like this for the rest of your life

It does make me a little sad to write it, but probably yes. I really want this pattern between us to improve (and he hasn't outright refused counseling, just made it clear that I would have to do all the work of getting him there, which is part of why I haven't made it happen yet. It'll be another time that I ""forced my way"" on him.)

But, honestly, I feel like the good outweighs the bad in our relationship. I didn't write out all the ways that he's great and that we are well suited for each other, but there are many. I also know there are serious flaws in our relationship, but I guess if push comes to shove they are not dealbreakers. We have a lot of family near us so will have a lot of support in raising kids. If that wasn't the case I would draw a hard line, ""counseling or no kids."""
"Also chiming in to say don't think of it as changing yourself. I know it can be very hard not to see it that way, but I promise it doesn't have to be. 

OP, I have been going through something similar in my own social life. I had started to notice that people were pulling away from me and not reacting well to some of the things I said. I realized I must be making people uncomfortable and that I needed to work on things (I still am, really). 

One of the things that I decided I needed to work on was my heavy use of sarcasm. I realized that people often didn't catch that I was being sarcastic and that most of the time it was just confusing or off putting to them. I really struggled with the idea of not being sarcastic all the time, because it seemed like such a huge part of my personality and who I am. At first I really didn't want to ""part"" with my sarcastic humor because it felt like I was abandoning part of myself. I thought it was what made me, *me*.

I decided I'd give it a go anyway. It was hard at first and I'm not going to say I never ever use sarcasm anymore, but I think I use it much less frequently. And I realized that it really wasn't so intrinsic to my personality as I thought. I really don't feel any different.. although maybe actually a bit more positive, which has probably made me feel better over all.

I suppose it could actually be that I still don't even realize that I'm doing it, but I think overall I have learned to be a lost less sarcastic. I honestly don't even notice that it's ""missing"". It was a bit of a crutch, really, and i guess I've found that I don't need it as much as I thought. 

Sorry if that was a bit long winded, but what I'm trying to say is, changes to your personal behavior can seem big and scary, but they don't necessarily end up being as big of a deal. Part of it is that it's hard accepting and admitting that you need to change, and part of it is just fear of losing your sense of self (or at least it was for me!) And definitely the bruised ego comes into play. 

But good on you for realizing that they might have some decent points and being willing to take a look at yourself. That is something a loooooooot of people are not able to do. I wish you good luck! "
Good makeup + an oblivious guy
If it was consensual he is not violating her safety. 
Youre right. I just cant help but see our relationship for what it was or what it could be instead of what it is. Thanks for the encouragement.

"Unfortunately yes, this is basically par for the course, in terms of the service culture.

Coincidentally I just got back from a 10 day trip across China similar to OP's with uncles and aunts planning and hosting us, though our purpose was mostly introducing my wife to my relatives. My relatives who are all generally ""nice people"" (save for one alcoholic uncle), will all take a much gruffer/sterner/blunt/""ruder"" attitude when talking to hotel clerks and restaurant servers and such, at least until they've established some baseline level of trust or familiarity (i.e. you helped me with something yesterday and did a good job, so today I don't need to be rude to get you to do what I want). For total strangers and one-off interactions, there's no real chance to establish trust, so it's probably always going to seem rude, esp. to Western standards.

That being said, here are some additional caveats:
-	There's so many goddamn people in China, that attendants often simply don't have the time or attention to pay attention to each customer. So in that way, customers can't just ""ask nicely"" and expect service, so people have gotten used to aggressively pushing to make sure they get what they need out of every interaction (the right bill amount, the right ticket, etc.).
-	Speaking of the right ticket and names, it's actually a huge pain in the ass if the name is wrong (even a typo). In our China trip, we were constantly being security checked and passport checked (e.g. have to pass an x-ray check just to get into the ticket office at Beijing main train station, and then a whole other security check for the terminal itself). People constantly check your ID cards or passports (e.g. even to buy museum tickets, they needed to see our passports). Getting your name wrong and not catching it in time means a potentially HUGE amount of hassle down the road; best case you get kicked off a train and have to buy a new ticket, but worse case you might even be detained by police, your passport confiscated, etc. So I assume your uncle was anxious about those consequences too.
-	All of that being said, there is still a spectrum of just how rude one should be to service people in China. Almost nobody is super polite and never-rude-at-all, but not everyone is a super aggressive/loud/almost-violent level of rude either. Your uncle may be in the ""upper-middle"" levels of acceptable rudeness, and if you want you could try to ask him about why he behaves that way (not to question or scold him, but just for your curiosity). Maybe then you can segue to saying something like, ""I appreciate you looking out for us and wanting us to have a smooth trip, but I wish you didn't have to get so worked up (make a joke about how it's not worth getting his own blood pressure in a tizzy over it)."""
He’s not the best character this twin bro “want to date her a few years for entertainment” really?? Sounds like an asshole himself.
"I mean i feel like you are talking about two completely different people here. He quit jobs and never had money and never paid you back but he was thoughtful and hardworking? 

He would do small nice things for you but there wasnt any food in the house? Wouldnt even take the effort to go on a walk with you? You were almost stuck in a country because he lied to you about buying tickets but you loved each other?

I dont understand why you need the approval of his family. You arent in the same country and can easily never contact these people again.

I am sorry for your loss, i truely am, but i feel like you need therapy processing this relationship.

"You aren't unlikable, you're just dating one of the guys that she wants to be the center of attention of. She sees you as competition which is why she's cold towards you but flirty towards everyone with a penis. She has no interest in actual friendship here that's pretty obvious. 


Her issues don't give her free reign to be a jerk. Stand up for yourself and for gods sake tell your boyfriend how unacceptable it is for him to just lap that shit up. He also sounds pretty shitty in this situation. "
"You're completely disregarding the mental illness part of this, obviously she's not calling you a liar but she literally can't see what you see and you need to understand that. I've been in her position before and it's hard to see how pretty someone thinks you are when you look in the mirror and don't see that at all. She can't control this, that's why it's a mental illness. Have a little more compassion"

"He was washing a car and was getting upset about getting water on him, and then cursed at you in public because he got a little wet? What a fucking baby."
"Honest answer on why not before today: more or less impossible. I only got the ring two weeks ago, we both work a ton during the week and last weekend we had some group outings that had been on the books for a while. I look back at the last 10 days or so and don't see a pattern of me manufacturing excuses not to do it. 

But I get your point, and I also agree that it doesn't matter what day it happens. I'd like to try and make it as surprising in the moment as possible, exactly because she's been so in-the-loop up until two weeks ago when I picked up the ring. 

And thanks for the last bit of advice, seeing it written out that way makes a lot more sense."
"So you yelled at her because she brought up a time when you called her a cunt? I want to give this the benefit of the doubt, but that's a really troubling context. You should be thanking your lucky stars she hasn't walked out on you over your name calling, one, and two, she's bringing it up to you because it (rightfully) bothers her a lot that someone who professes to love her would do that to her. What you need to be doing is apologising for it, understanding that you really hurt her something horrid when you did it, and never, ever call her a name again. At the very least. "
It’s odd that is the message you took out of this comment. I think s/he meant that while we force ourselves to downplay the attractiveness of a potential SO because it’s “shallow” this is harmful in the long term. Sexual compatibility is a huge part of a healthy and stable relationship. Ignoring that in favor of being perceived as shallow is silly.

"The fact that the teacher said that it didn’t  answer the prompt means the teacher followed an objective rubric. Giving her a good grade because it was a good essay that didn’t answer the prompt would be opinion, not the other way around. I’m having this same fight with my freshman on their DBQ’s. It doesn’t really matter if it’s awesome, I can’t give you points for being awesome if you didn’t talk about anything I actually put on the rubric. "
"Another question is what would be best for the child. Most hospitals have the father/partner/chosen coach help with the newborn while they attend to the birth mother- it is a very powerful bonding moment. Aside from him the lifelong benefit to the child, having someone with you who will follow through on explicit orders is perfect for labor and delivery. Ask him to prepare mentally. I say let him be there at the moment his child is born. "
"Have you tried talking to your sister yourself? 

My sister and I have a similar age gap (8 years, she’s older) and she often acted like my mother. I listened to her more than my mom and I usually took her advice because she was coming out of just love and care instead of love, care, and parental obligation. I wasn’t scared to talk with my sister because she couldn’t ground or punish me if I messed up.

Your sister definitely will not be happy if you snitch on her (even if it is for her own good). It will only cause her to probably seek more solace from her boyfriend and put you on an information diet.

The thing about teenagers and love: they’re idiots. They think this is it after a week. This is the one. I’m no better. The night after my sister met my first boyfriend, she pulled me aside and asked me what I was doing with this kid and that he was no good. I didn’t listen and she ended up being completely right. But she never held it over my head.

This is what sisters are for. If you can’t get through to her yourself, then resort to telling your mother.

"Have you and your sister sit down with your mother, talk about it and don't let her change the subject. Yes, it'll be horribly awkard but she's seeing patterns that aren't there. It's not healthy for anyone of you involved. 

Demand to know why she's acting this way. Don't just ask, she'll try to steer the conversation. Don't give in to her scolding, her guilt-tripping or any other manipulative tactics she may use. Remain steadfast and tell her you won't let her be until she answers your questions. 

If she seriously thinks you two are having/or might be considering an incestuous relationship it's not only insulting to you and your sister, but also shows that she believes herself a failure as a parent.

"Of course she's angry with you! You're *still* not accepting that you did something wrong, and making excuses for yourself instead. It doesn't matter how good your intentions are.

"Asthma is almost always multicausal, and many asthmatic kids grow up mildly triggered by their animals but still have basically well-managed conditions that aren't much different to living without animals (because all the other triggers are still there, and also because many people do adjust to their own animals even if others still bother them - I go through six weeks of hell with a new animal but then it's done). I think your experience, of a complete recovery and massive change in quality of life, is not the norm, and I don't think they could really have foreseen that. Doctors don't routinely recommend families with an asthmatic child stop having pets. It sucks that you missed out but I don't think they did anything particularly reckless or negligent here. They just didn't know."

"That's not how a marriage works. Don't get married, or hire a maid, if you don't want to keep your place of living clean. 

Being a wife does not sign you up for an endless, grueling, routine of housework by yourself. No matter how much money one of the spouses makes. 

And yes, being married entitles a person to combined sharing of resources, including financial. Don't get married if you can't handle that. "
"So... what should he do?  Keep pining after her, making himself miserable and probably making her uncomfortable when she inevitably starts to realize that things have changed?  Does he need to fake-marry her all for her sake?  

They may have made an agreement, but things have changed significantly - they certainly didn't plan for his mother's death leading to him having an emotional breakdown. He wouldn't be blindsiding her if he tells her what's happened, any more than anyone blindsides anyone when they break up.  

Also, how would him ""breaking up"" with her put her in danger?  Couples break up all the time, and given that he's just been through a fairly traumatic period, there's plenty of possible excuses they could give. "
"I'm kind of like you girlfriend, in that my usual attire/hair color/style can shift rapidly and quickly.  I'm a strong believer in ""Your body, your rules,"" but I take my boyfriend's preferences to mind when I'm making changes because his opinion matters to me.  I still might do something he doesn't like, but if I'm on the fence, his taste can be the deciding factor.  I took out my septum piercing partly because I had to get a new one and wasn't finding one I liked, but knowing my partner isn't a big fan, it made me decide to just take it out instead.

As for preferences, if my boyfriend cut his hair and stopped being so scruffy, I'd find him less attractive to me and would be eager for the scruff to come back, but I wouldn't stop loving him.  And when one of us does something that might not be attractive, we both focus on the other stuff that we do find attractive.  Appearances and styles change, but hair grows back, make up washes off, and piercings can be removed.

Just remember that her appearance can change again, and into something you like more, and if she's still the great and awesome girl you fell for, then just ride it out for now, but never be afraid to be honest about your feelings, just be sure to phrase them as to not sound controlling."
It’s one thing for parents to expect their child to help them in old age as a thank you for their support. It’s another thing to consider the first 18 years of your child’s life a financial transaction.
"I've been in a relationship for 9 years and it still confuses me when my SO gets a haircut.

And maybe these changes that she's going through mean that your growing apart. Or maybe you're just growing up together. It wouldn't be growing up if there weren't growing pains. "
"No.  Birth is a medical procedure, not a social event.  No one has a ""right"" to be there.  This is awful advice.  When you give birth, you can die. It's not a power play to not want someone you don't get along with there.  Dad can see the baby once it's born.

Talk to your doctor about this ahead of time OP.  NO ONE has a right to your body at any time, not even during birth.  Do what you feel most comfortable with.  Your life and baby's life could count on it."
"I have to know why she did that before starting fresh with her. Currently she's saying she doesn't even know why she did it so I'm waiting for her to gather her mind.

We decided not to talk or see each other until she understands why. She looked destroyed when I last saw her. Apart from being his boyfriend for 7 years, I'm also her best friend she grew up with. I am going to do her a favor and give her time for her to recover her thoughts because of the incredible 7 years she gave to me. I still love her but my trust is shattered. 

If I see actions indicating that I can trust her again AND I somehow digest what she did, I won't leave her. It has to be both though, one of them isn't enough on its own. Otherwise, it's done."
"Kissing isn't the worst offense ever, but personally I would find it to be too much and leave.

For me it would be all about the inability to trust. Sure, I guess it's good that they didn't have sex, but how would you ever be able to feel comfortable when she goes out drinking with out you? How you will you be able to believe that she won't just start making out with some guy again? Or worse go home with him? I would find all of that insecurity and anxiety too much to handle, and would rather walk.

If you *do* decide to stay, you need to find constructive outlets for your frustration. It's understandable to be angry and sad and frustrated. But if you are getting to the point that you feel you need to smash in walls - that's a problem.

Do what is best for you. If you decide to stay she needs to be fully bought in and prepared to do what it takes to win your trust back.

If she doesn't then walk."
"&gt;their interest rates are through the roof and credit is horrible.

So, a bank, and a credit agency, whose literal JOB it is to assess how risky lending someone money is, dont want to lend her money. What makes you, an amateur, think you know better?

You'll NEVER get it back, if you live to 100"
"This is an appalling request and it must be enraging that your husband wants to go along with it. 

I'd just advise you not to lose sight of how devasted your husband must have felt to receive this bill. Parents are supposed to put their kids first, make sacrifices for them and love them more than anything- certainly more than money. 

This must have felt like such a shaming rejection, and we're programmed to seek our parents love and approval. I don't know if he's said anything like this or talked about his relationship with his parents before, but I would ask him about his feelings and try to get to the bottom of why he feels he has to buy his parents' affection.

There are so many logical and practical reasons not to pay his parents, but I don't think he's acting from a place of logic- he's scared he's going to lose the people who should love him unconditionally, and it's probably brought up a lot of childhood anxieties about being worthy and lovable. "
Not fucking necessary. This is wildly inappropriate for this thread. 
"He busted through a locked door to get to her and punch the walls next to her while screaming in her face. Not in another room. Not breaking shit outside. Right next to her. After busting down a door.

It’s clear from your posts that even 24 year olds don’t have much emotional and intellectual maturity...
"Write the note. I'm sure they'll know that you appreciate what they've done but it's always nice to know that the other person received their gift, especially when it's something you willingly give up"
"I think she was expecting a proposal or something and then took the most cowardly and immature way out. It’s insane how heartless and cruel some people can be. It’s going to be hard man but life goes on. It’s difficult to look at it this way but honestly if this is the best she can give you after 5 years then you dodged a bullet, she had a weak moral character and a selfish attitude."
"RENT, from BIRTH? What, is he supposed to pay his medical bill from the hospital he was born in, too? Do these people realize they were *legally and financially responsible* for him while he was underage? If it was me, this would be a one-way ticket to No Contact City, population MIL and FIL. "
"What? I'm sorry but that makes zero sense. If they're bad enough that you refuse to go around them for your own sake, then you have no business subjecting an innocent baby who doesn't know any better to their shit. Protect your child."
So you don't want her to find a sexual partner that's not you but it's okay for you to do it?
That is a LOT to ask of a 3-month old boyfriend. Most people wouldn't even meet their partner's children at that point. Why are you already living together so soon? I get that you love your girlfriend but in reality you don't even know her well yet. 
"You're making this about you and what you want. You want to feel good about ""helping"" and possibly feel good about being needed, and it doesn't matter to you how your girlfriend feels about it. The best way you can help is by listening to her and respecting her needs and boundaries. Forcing unwanted ""help"" on people who refuse is insulting and selfish.

Maybe if you can reflect upon that for a moment and truly try to understand *why* your gf doesn't want money from you, then you will be in a place to discuss it with her and make it not about *you* but instead about *her*."
"Why would you even say that? That's not funny in the least, and even if you thought she actually meant that, why would you retaliate in the same way? This is messed up. What is even your question here, dude? "

"I was with guys from high school to age 20. Two relationships with guys so you'd call me pretty straight and I thought that the sex was okay. Used to think about being with women but I didn't actively pursue it... Partly because there's no LGBT scene where I live and I just thought it would never happen (and in two relationships with only a small break).

Then I met my now girlfriend and honestly, if I felt the need to label myself I would say lesbian. I can't imagine myself ever having sex with a man again or being anywhere near a naked penis and FOR SURE will NEVER have one in my mouth again. It made me realise what ""good sex"" really is... I kind of feel like I've found myself in a million ways and my life is now just how I want it to be.

So my advice is try it, experiment while you're young because if I never did, I could be living my entire life unfulfilled and not even have a clue how great it could have been."

"I think that if her family is so alarmed by her behavior that they’re reaching out to *you* for help, you need to lock your shit down for your own *safety*, as well as your fiancée’s. If your ex is that unhinged, allowing her to easily monitor your movements and activities via social media is the last thing you want. She may decide to do something drastic.

Assume she’s an unsafe person right now and protect yourself accordingly. This isn’t a “favor” to anyone, it’s self-preservation. It may not be fair, but I’ve had to put up with some unfairness in order to extricate unstable/toxic people from my life, and I don’t regret it. It’s better than the alternatives."

It's shit like that that made her the way she is. ""Tee hee everyone will always support me because I'm a special unicorn.""

Then you called her on her bullshit and she was left foundering for a reasonable answer and came up empty. So she played the pity party card. 

This ""yet"" garbage needs to be hammered out. You're both late 20's and you mentioned kids are in your future. They really shouldn't be until this shit is figured out, otherwise you're going to have a baby(ies) and a child masquerading as an adult. "

"Again, you have bigger issues here, then.  You have a bf that doesn't want you out with he and his friends.  My SO and I (29 years together) have a big group of friends, male and female, that we join every week for drinks, and we all vacation together.  I couldn't imagine not having him there. "
"I was in this exact situation in my early twenties. Get out NOW. Trust me, if he wanted to be with you he would make it public. He's hiding something"
How do you handle this? She's preparing to or already has cheated on you man. That's what's happening here.
"Ha! I was reading this post thinking that OP’s dad sounded a *lot* like mine, down to the dog-pride-nonsense-excuses for hurtful decisions. In my family’s case you’re 100% on the nose.

Given OP’s willingness to cut him off for this, I can’t imagine it’s a first-time offense."
"&gt; rt of stability at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; Your post is somewhat condescending, and yet, you accuse the OP of being just that. It seems that many of the posters did not appreciate his POV because it is a) different from their own, b) embarrasses them on an implicit level, since it calls into question their own level of ambition and achievement.

Gosh, you could not be more wrong about me. 

Good day to you. "

That's a deal breaker ladies.
"You need to approach it from a non-accusatory position of ""I realize this is going to sound insecure, and I know you aren't doing anything on purpose, but hear me out.""

You need to make it about her helping you be reassured, not about ""You're doing something wrong!"".

If the behavior is innocent, that approach will work.  If it's not innocent, you will get an equally strong defensive response either way.

The problem in many of these situations is that the straying spouse often convinces themselves that their behavior isn't a problem.  They tell themselves: 

* It's just harmless flirting;

* I just enjoy the attention, I'm never going to act on it;

* I'm just protecting my spouse from feeling bad because they won't understand it's all in harmless fun;

* I'm just protecting my spouse because he/she wouldn't enjoy our activities/conversation/attitudes.

Then, feelings develop and BAM!"

"It sucks that he can't go but honestly, I understand him. My dog is very high maintenance and he's 110 lbs and has never been put in a kennel in his life. A year ago my immediate and extended family wanted to go on a big trip and my sister and I said we couldn't go due to the dog. Suddenly everyone was on our case saying it was dumb that we were turning down a free trip to Mexico for my dog.

My dog is a part of the family and is very routine-oriented. I would never leave him somewhere where he would be uncomfortable and stress him out. 

Your dad probably doesn't was to disrupt the dogs routine and life especially considering this dog has been through a lot health wise and I understand not wanting to give the burden of care to anyone else.

If your sister isn't making it a big deal, then you shouldn't either for your own sanity. Hopefully things work out in the end and he can come for the day."

Excellent question! I'm going to take a wild guess and say no
"Ugh. This happened to me with a vacuum also. I have a 20 year old Kirby. Great vacuum. Still worked fine, but it didn’t get the dog hair off rugs. So I asked for a specific one. He got me a different one that was less expensive. I never said anything other than thanking him, and I was truly grateful for the new vacuum (that Kirby is so heavy to lift up and down the stairs), but inside I was so upset. I now have two vacuums that don’t properly clean my rugs.  "
Is he an idiot? Real question. Do you think he is so dumb he doesn't realise he's getting you something you specifically said you didn't want?
"Whether or not she takes a vacation exactly on her birthday should *not* be causing her enough stress to invoke an involuntary stress response. It sounds like she's gotten what she wanted for so long, that not getting her way has now become unfathomable. Basically, you're not going to be able to prevent this type of reaction unless you give her *exactly* what she wants 24/7. Which....man, is such an unfortunate situation for you."
"Oh boy.  So, she's an entitled brat on a free ride and she didn't get a pony or her dream vacation, so she mopes around.  I'm glad you worked hard enough at life to be ready and able to drop $2,000 on her birthday to cheer her up, but I feel sorry for you that you would be spending it on her."
"Dude. You claim to be on your wife side. But the very way you've phrased the title is you and your parents Vs your wife.

"If you're trying to date vanilla people, you might want to pull back on the kink stuff while doing it. It would be a lot to process."
"Right, everyone here understands that. Here's how you come across

""My wife opened my relationship up on my end, I've been getting what I want, but now my wife wants to have sex again, but I don't want to because I already have sex from a younger version of my wife. My wife doesn't want to open up her end, but also I wouldn't want that either.""

Basically ""I want what I want, but am not interested in what my wife wants"""
Sounds like an excuse. 
I think outside of this issue you could really benefit from some therapy. You have some harmful views about sex that are probably contributing to what you are feeling right now. Might be worth thinking about. 
"Honestly, and I'm being serious, would you *want* to marry someone who will only marry you if a *book* **tells** them to?"
I've read that twice today and it's very true. 
"I didn't think you need to worry about your boyfriend leaving you for here. If anything, he should be worried you'll leave him for her. 
You wrote a long love letter to her in this post and barely mentioned him. You're obsessed all right."

"It's always best to get it tested medically, instead of determining medical needs from the comments of random strangers on reddit."
"First off, was told by a first aid teacher/EMT how they test if someone is actually passed out. The EMT will hold the person's (limp) arm/hand above their head as they're laying down and drops the hand onto their face. If the person slaps themselves, they're really out. If they move their hand/arm to fall away from their face, probably faking. People avoid hitting themselves without really thinking about it. But if she reads this, she'll know how to fake that too.

Secondly, why on earth are you with someone you're so paranoid about. The test looks fake (looks alot like pencil tbh) and it sounds like she's lying a lot but does it really matter? You'll always doubt her (I would too) and that's no way to live your life. Maybe she really is sick but it doesn't sound like a stable relationship at all. "
"Honestly, she needs those voicemails because they are far more important than temporary embarrassment or pain. She may need to send them to a lawyer, she may have to use them to get a restraining order, she may have use them in a custody hearing. 

Hopefully she can be strong enough to not let them sway her, or even to not listen at all. But she needs them. "
"""I really regret dating you"" Sounds like you should do her a favour and break up. "

"Mom: “We have a beggar in the House”. 
Op: Don’t be so hard on yourself, mom."
"&gt; She told me she wanted to sleep with me because she'd never slept with a fat guy before so wanted to see what it was like

"Not only that, but if they see him let the Alicia incident slide it will set a tone that OP is down with that creepy shit. Any other complaints that may be there probably won't ever surface because theyll think it will fall on deaf ears. I wouldnt be surprised if more women started leaving."
"Ok, so when she raises her voice at you, how do you feel? Are you frustrated, annoyed? Are you afraid she'll start punching you and maybe give you a black eye or break your arm?

Now thing about when you raise your voice at her. You are probably stronger and bigger than she is, so when you are angry specifically at her and you raise your voice, you will likely be intimidating and scary. Because you are stronger and bigger than she is, if you snapped, you could legitimately hurt her or even kill her. I am not saying you would, but you could. If she would snap, she might give you a black eye at 'best' but you can physically fight her off probably fairly easily if she were to go for your throat or whatever. When the tables are turned, she can't. If you snapped and would go for her, there's virtually nothing she can do. She's aware of that because she's the physically weaker person in your relationship. This is why you have to be EXTRA mindful of how your behaviour makes her feel.

A behaviour in her towards you might just annoy you or make you frustrated or angry but that exact same behaviour can easily become physically threatening to a women or a weaker man."
The stealing the car thing was also after he threatened to rape his teenage neighbors. OP posted a comment with that extra info. 
"Yep she sounds pretty immature. She probably used to seem ""cool"" because you were at the same maturity level, but as you've matured, she has not. "
Never more applicable than this situation.  He might also have to block her access to his FB page.
"I wouldn't give him another chance.  If he wants to maintain a friendship with other guys from the club, he can see them on his own time.  I'm not super sympathetic to the idea of a 30-y.o. man creeping on a 19-y.o. because he's maybe going through something with his wife, and he should have knocked off the weird behavior after you talked to him the first time, anyway.  If you let him stay in the group, you're teaching him that it's okay if he creeps on women as long as he seems to genuinely apologize to you afterward."
[deleted]
"It's not even just hormones, being in physical pain and discomfort and thinking about the future trauma your body is going to have to go through makes it very hard to be in a good mindset. "
"This will probably get buried but OP just stated in a comment that his teenage roomates told OP's mom that the brother ""threatened to rape them"". I think it is important context and am kind of shocked that neither OP or her family think this is a big deal."
"I think your intuition is spot on, but you can’t just hope it’ll magically transform into the right move. You can only work on you, and honestly it looks like you’re doing so great and I’m so proud of you just reading what you’ve shared with us, but only he can work on himself. He seems like a dud only interested in shifting blame and responsibility elsewhere.

You and your children would likely be better off without you being tied to him by marriage and everything financial that goes along with that. He sounds like an anchor, he’s probably only going to drag you down.

He’s a fully grown man who hasn’t yet been motivated to do right by his family with a baby of his own in play. What do you think will change him that won’t harm you, like learning the hard way?

He doesn’t sound like he gives you half the respect and good will you give him and you deserve better than that. Your kids deserve to see you treated right so they know how to treat others and how they should be treated."
"It's like lying to your girlfriend about how you love the halibut she makes, but you really hate halibut. She'll be making it the rest of your life thinking everything is fine until you finally explode due to life and relationship stress on top of that fucking plate of god-awful halibut and throw it across the dining room.

It can all be avoided by just being honest."
it's annoying because soooooo many women fake orgasms that when you try to be honest with a guy they think something's wrong with you because all their past partners were able to come with vaginal sex easily....
"Uhhhh why are you engaging this dude to the point of getting drinks with him? 

You need to keep work at work and stop talking to him because you obviously cannot be just friends. "
"&gt;**After a few too many drinks**, and after he had walked her a few blocks back to her place, they ended up kissing, and eventually had sex that night

NOPE! I hate when people try to blame their selfish decisions on alcohol. If he wasn't attracted to her then him drinking the whole bar would not have made him *want* to put his penis in her..

It happened. They felt guilty. Here's the part where it went from a regrettable decision to actively lying to you and a huge betrayal. **He got back together with you and didn't tell you.** She kept her mouth shut too, both to you and her husband who she cheated on (side note: she's mad her husband cheated so she does the same thing? They are two peas in a pod! Toxic duo. She should have divorced him 3 years ago!).

&gt;our relationship is stronger than ever now ... I guess I just wish he’d told me sooner

####This is why he didn't tell you sooner!

He got back with you determined to make it work (and also working off guilt from fucking your best friend behind your back). He succeeded in that, even proposed. Your love tank is filled with so much good, it softens the blow for this revelation. Whereas if he told you when you first got back together he knew there was a bigger risk of you walking away. He denied you the agency to make an informed decision and if you did stay, he denied you 3 years to process and move on from this. **It was cowardly and selfish of him to keep this from you!**

Real talk, give him back the ring and put the engagement on hold. Tell him you're not comfortable moving forward in light of this new information. Demand couples counseling and if you make it through, you want a new proposal not tainted by him withholding information you should have known before agreeing to spend your life with him.

Contact your friend. Tell her you know. The wedding is on hold. If you do proceed, she will not get an invite."
According to OP he’s always snored.
"Thanks for the advice, it is hard to hear, but it is true.  I did tell him recently if he truely wanted marriage and kids, there would need to be a timeline (as horrible as that sounds)."
How have you not dumped him? He’s telling quite clearly your stuff &lt; his stuff. He doesn’t see you as an equal. 
"You forgot the finish. 

OP should make a fake picture of her with short hair and pretend she gave them to some cancer support group, as the other one will be in her expensive resort. "
"&gt;I'm not planning to vaccinate my child 


Then I would cut you out of my life too. I imagine she has no patience for people who are willfully, peversely, CHOOSING to be ignorant, people who are willfully risking the health of their children and that of the children they meet. She probably can't be BOTHERED dealing with people of such *profound* stupidity and stubbornness in my life. It is not possible to be friends with people who will not listen to reason.  And I certainly would make sure I never let my kids near your family, to protect them from the cesspool of bacteria that your kids are about to become. It would be the height of stupidity to let them be around your children.

&gt;she shouldn't interfere with my choices?

Yes, EVERYONE YOU MEET  should interfere in your foolish, ignorant, dangerous, selfish, ill-informed, dangerous dangerous, dangerous choices. I wish to God that there were LAWS to interfere,  and laws to take your children away from you, you stupid, stupid, stupid woman.  May the CPS descend on you soon."
I think she mostly travels between various plastic surgery clinics. 
"You're right. This is more about her emotions than mine and I din't really think about it like that. She has talked about how horrible she feels, but never mentioned how awful I must feel for having my trust breached."
"On the one hand, she's being unreasonable. On the other hand, I think I see the source of the problem. You thought the present was about the trip itself. What she actually cared more about was you showing how much you care for her by putting in the effort required to plan a special experience. I can tell because I've been having a similar argument with my husband about dates for years now. 

It does sound as if she was unclear that she wanted the vacation to be right on her birthday. My guess is you haven't been together for long enough for her to realize that most men can't hear hints and implications or Intuit what we mean. She has to learn to be more clear. "
"What’s upsetting is that both OP’s bf and your husband take upon themselves to decide what’s best for you, ignoring your wishes and forcing you to accept their wisdom by making it a gift so you have to a) accept it and b) pretend to be grateful. I agree with you: nip that shit in the bud! Simply don’t accept the gift. Don’t nag, don’t even argue, just say: oh, sorry, I thought I was clear I don’t have space for that in my room. Can you please take it back? Thanks. "
"People often will go into denial when faced with a very ugly truth. The siblings wont thank the OP, or offer sympathy. More likely they will permanently ostracize him and circle the wagons around their mother. 

And don't think for a second the mother will corroborate the past, or what part of it she remembers and how she has since rationalized it. 

Agree with other posters the least worst option is telling the siblings a hint of his dark childhood, while very seriously telling them if they knew the full truth it would permanently change their relationships with him and with their mother. "
"Honestly, I’d probably show his siblings this post. "
Why would you be invited to the kids birthday? You barely know him. Just let it go
"&gt;OF COURSE HE WASN'T INTERESTED DUHHH

Just adding on he will probally loudly deny it for days... to anyone who will listen. If he isn't mature enough to express interest like an adult there is a good chance he'll go full high school teenager mode. "
"Their house, their rules. Don't smoke in their house.

Start saving up to move out. They sound awful."
There’s no way I’d ever put a smile on around someone who accused me of molesting children! Or half the other shit this lunatic said. OP isn’t forcing anyone to tiptoe around her; this is entirely a bed of John’s making. 
"&gt; Could someone like this ever change? He's a manipulative, immature, and abusive sociopath and blames me for all of his mistakes and bad decisions.

The chances of someone like that changing are incredibly slim, if not basically impossible. It's far more likely he'll just get more abusive.

But even if he did change... Why would you want him back? He gave you two black eyes. He destroyed your guitar. He attacked you. He threatened your dad's life. He's emotionally attacking you by posting hurtful things on social media. 

Those things aren't forgivable. Even his own mother is telling you to stay away from him.  There is nothing in this world he could do to erase how terrible he has been to you, even if he wanted to be good to you. And it's clear he doesn't want to be good to you. "
"There are some good articles and such out there about the problem with playing devil’s advocate in these conversations. I’m on mobile so can’t link to any, but some googling should yield some things that you might send to him or use to help explain why it’s a shitty thing to do. "
"Tell him close to the end of a shift though. Otherwise, he’s stuck at work knowing there is a problem with no way to fix it. "
"She is not required to go to the movie with her work, but she has made plans to go and she *wants* to go. There is also a possibility that ditching last minute might reflect badly on her. So she is going. That is reasonable of her. You need to remember that whilst you might not consider these things important that she does think it is important.

You yourself write that your girlfriend has been supportive of you, and that you wanted to thank her for it. But when she doesn’t ditch something she considers important on short notice to hang out with you then you are upset because this single incident shows she isn’t being suportive enough. You wrote that she knows how toxic your home is and seem to assume she understod you asking to hang out was you asking for support, but these are assumptions you are making about her understanding of the situation. Your girlfriend might assume that you can manage one evening alone and that she can be there for you every other evening when she doesn’t have work-related plans.

You are assuming that because your girlfriend isn’t ditching her work-related plans to be with you on your first free day back it means that she doesn’t value supporting your partner as much as you do. And it’s a real possibility that you have conflicting values. But I would urge you to really consider how her perspective might differ from yours. If your girlfriend considers this work-related event important and don’t realise that you need extra support on you first free day home, then is she really being unsupportive?

Also, you can defenitly ask for support and attention in hard times. But remember that other people don’t automatically know or understand how you want to be supported. Also, they are going to have to balance being supportive of you with other commitments in their lives. That might be something you migth need keep perspective on too."
"I think there’s a high chance she’ll just ignore him. She will probably still let her kid out of the car in front of the house and drive off and he will have no choice but to take care of Y. Additionally, Y will feel super hurt and neglected when he discovers (and no way will he not sense this at least) that he’s being past around like a mouldy potato nobody wants. What I’m saying is: OP’s situation is way more complicated than it seems. He is dealing with extremely selfish adults and a vulnerable child. My suggestion would be to start by setting small but firm boundaries and then slowly increasing them. I.e. you can only babysit two times a week. Make her choose those two times then and there. Make clear what will happen if she drops off the kid at any other time. Then slowly increase the boundaries to your comfort level. "

"You a re 32 years old and you can't show up at your cousins wedding because an ex girlfriend will be there?

Grow up!  Be polite if you encounter each other and circulate."
That’s wondeful news! I’m interested though if you have spoken about how long she has had feelings for you for? What were her reasons for not making a move ?
"Yeah, for me a vasectomy would be a fucking bonus! You mean I don't have to have the argument about how I can't be on hormonal birth control because it makes me suicidal? HELL YES. "
"&gt; It does happen that sometimes a person who seems self-sufficient doesn't make any of the people around them get into the habit of showing caring, and with no pattern of giving and receiving caring, the rift persists. Your parents had an obligation not to treat you like that, but maybe your siblings simply followed their lead and fell into patterns like that.

I spent so much of my life trying so damn hard to get even one of them to care and they never did... this is certainly not a case of me going my own way and others respecting my wish. "
Lmao he truly on some OTHER lookin godly type shit

"“Nobody will be hurt”
Kids are always hurt the hardest with their parents separation."
"I'm so so sorry for your loss OP. If it helps, the fact that your phone blew up with messages like it did means that you are very loved and lots of people wish you well and want to help. I'm also annoyed with your gf for getting angry with you and making your loss about her. Maybe give her a little space and turn to some other friends and family in this time. Internet hugs."
"This. He blatantly does not give a single fuck about you or your feelings. If he did, he wouldn’t have been so defensive and fucking weird when you brought up the issue with him. I want to punch him. He sounds like such an immature fucking twat."
"You need the support of /r/justnomil. They are very experienced in cases like this.

Ps. You don’t need to name YOUR child any name you don’t like. I would put them all on an information diet, do not discuss your name plans with them at all."
"I've had recurring dreams since I was a child about being chased by militant groups or governments. I'd have reels of certain dreams that would repeat day by day and stop before coming back at some point later. Definitely NOT what I want to dream about, nor even want to think about. I'm also not in the military(nor could I have been as an 8 year old). 

It's ok to be annoyed. She has no control over it (most probably) but you are also experiencing her dream unwillingly haha. I know I'd be annoyed.

You should talk to her about it to let her know, ""hey... so I've been hearing these dreams you've been having out loud lately."" It could help to talk it over for a bit. And like she said, she might actually be annoyed that she's having these dreams. "

Therapy. Talk to a counsellor. Can't hurt. Professionals won't judge and will have more experience dealing with this and helping you explore the why behind it. 
"Make up, getting breasts, crushes on boys, questions about what words mean that may be relating to sex, girl friend drama, interests in clothes, what periods are, what they fee like, how babies are made, shaving, bras, what kind of underwear to wear..."
There is only one way to find out and that’s to do it. Otherwise you would always wonder if it is meant to be. Live life with no regrets! 
Those morals just happen to line up with Hannah's desire to get revenge? I don't buy it.
"He wants to stay together but never get married sounds like.  He's not going to be the one to end this.  If you decide you don't want to continue long term in that arrangement, you have to walk away"
"Nope, she told you it is the way she is and what she prefers to do. You need to break up if you can't get over it."
"I think savings account, fair enough if you don’t think the relationship is going to last. If you are giving your nephew toys in front of the other kids it would be nice to get them something too. Do they have a lot of other family? "
"Agreed, but she's a big girl and could have said ""I'm aborting"". It's a bit of seafood and the odd glass of wine, not a bathtub full of gin."
"She wants to provoke a reaction and she has. I would just respond with one-word answers: “cool” or “nice.” If she point out that something she bought is specifically more expensive than something you bought, you say “so?” “And?” If you act like you don’t care, maybe she’ll back off. 

If she doesn’t, well, I agree with the other comments that say this isn’t technically your business. Who cares that she’s copying you? How is it affecting you other than making you jealous?

If she continues to be an ass even when you show lack of interest, and it bugs you that much, you should probably look into moving out."
"I'm so sorry I hope you are ok!!! I can't imagine the shock you must be in as it's actually really scary to be attacked like that. 

You now know what kind of person your 'best friend' truly is. I once read that whilst we may consider some people our friends, they do not feel the same way. Has she ever let you down before? "
Its not going to ever be the same. Its very rare a coat like that survived being shaved down.
"I think the issue here is beyond sex/ sexual incompatibility and has moved to an issue with your boyfriend: he sounds really selfish. He won't compromise, is critical of your sex drive, and somehow imagines you'll be excited and aroused by this? Seriously, wow. So immature.

If you really want to make this work, you need to sit him down and have a serious chat. Tell him that you WANT to have a healthy sex life but how demanding he is about sex is making you feel neglected, resentful and angry. Healthy relationships with healthy sex lives come with compromise. If he wants anything near what he wants, he needs to work with you, instead of trying to push you into being some different ideal. And if he's resentful, or argues with you, you'll never have the kind of relationship with this guy unless he decides to make some major attitude adjustments and you can't force him to make them. Only way to get to a better relationship is to leave this one."
"&gt; This has been my repeated mantra the entire time, that only victim here is that poor little girl.

Don't downplay your assault. You were a victim in this, too."
"I'd be inclined to ask why someone who holds such anti-LGBT views would even want to come to your wedding in the first place?

It's a bit like being vehemently against animal cruelty, but accepting an invitation to a dog fight.

You could argue that not everyone in a wedding party necessarily agrees with the choice of partner. But they respect the choice of the people tying the knot.

That's a little different from publicly denouncing anyone and everyone who embarks on a gay marriage. That's not a matter of preference, it's a matter of principle. And if you're going to stand by your principles, then it's somewhat hypocritical to start complaining that you're off the guest list for an event with which you fundamentally don't agree.

You're not being unreasonable for putting your foot down. It's your wedding."
"Does she take prenatal vitamins, exercise, drink water, make her prenatal appointments?  These are also important and will probably contribute more to a healthy baby. 

I totally understand you wanting a healthy baby. I saw further down that she wanted to terminate.  What changed her mind?  Full disclosure, I’m also about 5 months pregnant, and though this was a wanted, happy event, I struggle constantly with feeling judged, feeling like there’s an alien growing in me, and striking a balance between honoring myself as a person outside of motherhood. I imagine if she originally didn’t want a child, those emotions are much larger and a bigger struggle.

I’m not saying that your concerns are wrong, but the dietary issues may be a smaller issue than the underlying emotional ones. "
No one considering that OP is the thing being hidden? Maybe OP is her side piece?
"Okay that clarifies things. The belly rubbing and the picking the cat up are things you know Fluffy doesn't like, and Fluffy was making that clear. He should def cut it out. I guess what I was thinking was, if he was petting your cat in a normal way, like you would do, and suddenly your cat was acting out of character, does that necessarily mean it's something he did, or could it mean something else? Like your cat developing some kind of medical issue.

You told him to stop and he absolutely does need to stop. But if you think he did something that he had reason to know would hurt Fluffy, that's very serious, whereas if he was just petting your cat nicely and your cat hissed at him, that's not a sign you have a kitty abuser as a friend."
"I didn't seek out grooming for my dog at all, I was hanging out with my friend and she offered because she needs practice. I'd never had my dog groomed before and I was curious how different it would be from what I do at home. I feel like you and others who are replying are completely missing that I *never* agreed to have my dog's fur cut, let alone shaved. We clearly discussed what would happen. She was supposed to be bathed, dried, brushed and nails trimmed - that's it. This response is really cold. "
THANK YOU!! I get that not everyone is an expert on double coated dogs but I feel like a lot of people here are dumping all over me like I'm trying to fire a groomer who put the wrong color bow on my dog's ear. This is a really big deal to me and I'm so scared there might be permanent damage. 
"&gt;Every sexual harasser has friends and a family. A man who sexually harasses a woman might be someone else's dad, brother, son... it doesn't change anything.

"For fucks sake. That is a horrible reason to move in with someone.

NOTHING good will come of moving in with him right now.

"&gt;For the most part he is a good man, and I love him dearly. But I've tried to tell him I cannot keep fixing these messes for him and nothing seems to stick.

Probably because you keep fixing these messes for him. It sucks but I think you can't safely stay married."
"The fact that she asks for this kind of makes me feel like the relationship is already ruined. 

Ruined for you if she sleeps with someone else

Ruined for her if she doesn’t 

And ruined because I can’t imagine how hurtful it must be to hear someone you love ask you if they can sleep with someone else, no matter what the circumstances are"
Him not wanting to be sexually touched randomly means he has personal boundary issues?
"I have a relative  like this: in his 40s,  trump supporter, thinks it’s fun to annoy and pester people, *especially when they’re women.*

When he asks when I’m going to do thing, I always answer noncommittally, “eh, probably never.” Then I change the subject very rapidly usually asking about their kids, “speaking of which, how’s kid’s piano/swimming/karate/whatever going?”

Throw them off. It annoys the hell out of them and they never get a chance to think they got to you or hit a nerve.

"You would come off as a massive asshole if you asked that of her. Things are awkward because *you* cheated on her, if anyone should be skipping gatherings, it's you. Cheating on her and then taking away the enjoyment of spending time with friends because you don't want to see the person you cheated on is majorly selfish."
are you sure she even wants to be pregnant?
Or the person will assume it’s just his wife making him say that or whatever and keep trying 
"Just a shot in the dark, but my first thought is she wasn't comfortable/found the idea confronting of going to the jail, but couldn't bring herself to say so (to anyone) because it would feel like letting her dad down. "
"If that is indeed true, and it usually isn't, you would be the exception, not the rule. I don't think you understand how that kind of wealth works, here's an example. My husband's grandmother bought a condo in LA for very cheap. She left that condo to her son, who sold it for several hundreds of thousands. He spent 200K on a house. That house is now worth 800k. That's 600k of wealth that was generated just through property ownership and will pass to his kids. 

We're talking about generational wealth here... Redlining was one generation ago, why do you think it wouldn't be affecting the poverty level of the current generation? The median wealth of white people in the US is high because their parents and grandparents were able to invest in property that they inherited after it increased in value."
"You'd be amazed at how common this is. Something like 75% of women can't orgasm during sex, they need something else to achieve it. This is something your partner should be made aware of.

The main reason for this seems to be the distance between the vagina and the clitoris. Apparently anything more than (I think, I read this ages ago) a 5cm distance will make achieving orgasm through vaginal intercourse alone very difficult. Most women have a larger distance. 

I've spoke to my friends about this and the statistics seem to check out.

It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you, and you shouldn't feel ashamed of it. Your partner should be understanding and do more to allow you to enjoy the experience. "
"Unless there’s something you’re not telling us that makes you suspicious of Alison, it sounds like a good idea. If something were to happen to you, adoption would protect both of them. It means  that Grace can benefit from Alison’s benefits and insurance. If you and Alison were to split up, don’t you think Alison should be able to at least visit her? "
"Don't bust out the ""I'm breaking up with you over a dog"" speech as your first step.""Gracious, I see the error of my ways and will change immediately,"" said no one ever when presented with an ultimatum.

Instead, talk about how you don't feel heard, how you feel that she disregards your feelings entirely, things like that. Talk about why one dog and one cat aren't enough for her. Remind her that you didn't want the first dog or the cat. Listen to her feelings on the matter. Validate them, but you don't have to agree, you are entitled to your feelings on having a second dog, or on a dog at all. Try to see this as you and her against the problem, not as you against her. "
"Damn that was pretty harsh I mean she didn't ""intentionally turn it into a mountain""  she was just trying to make him feel less insecure about himself and honestly it seems like he was being a bit pushy abt it "

Yes it is the case. Watch:

""Straight\-up told her..."" and ""absolutely disgusting..."" and ""she agreed."" That's clear, final, and binding.

\&gt; We have no idea to what extent this was discussed and how serious the agreement they came to was

Never recommend counseling when abuse is involved. 
"Sorry to shatter the illusion, but he doesn't trust you.  

Time or marriage won't make this better, it will make this problem worse.  

If it's just a flat out case of him not trusting you then your relationship is over, you can't have a relationship without trust.

If it's some weakness of his that is driving his distrust then he needs to be working with a professional to understand what's driving things and how to correct it.  If he's unwilling to see a professional, or if he's not trying to fix things,then  your relationship is over, because it still manifests as distrust.

My wife was always hot, me, I look like a less hairy bigfoot.   We went to college together, and there were lots of times she was out without me, I wasn't worried about what she was doing, or who she was with or how she was dressed.  I'd sometimes see her a frat/sorority parties, dancing, or at other parties.  My friends were always wondering why I wasn't worried about her cheating/leaving me, because they would be.   Bottom line.  If she wants someone else there isn't a damn thing I can do, but I can do a whole lot of things that can make her not want me.    "
Just throw the whole fiancé away
"Guy here; you're right, most of us don't understand. I have to explain similar shit to my friends fairly often and I'm sure I wouldn't get it either if I hadn't been around so many assaults."
"He doesn't sound like a friend.  A friend might gently, privately point out some social problems, but writing a public speech is cruel.

I think you should just let the distance grow until you're no longer in contact.  No one needs that in their life.

On a different note, if you're genuinely concerned about the things he said, ask a trusted family member or friend if there's truth to it.  My best social advice is that people like to talk about themselves, and you'll rarely go wrong asking a thoughtful question.
"
"That's why I said keeping quiet OR saying only positive things should be the options. What good does it do your partner's self-esteem to say things like ""you look awful"" or ""why are you wearing that?"" Yes, I do agree that if you ask for an honest opinion, that is what you may get and should be okay with it, depending on the guy and the relationship dynamic. However, in my case, even when I do ask my fiance for an honest opinion, his usual response is ""you look sexy as hell!"" :)"
"&gt;She may not see it as a problem, but obviously she wouldn't. She's the one frivolously breaking the law in the first place and even willingly involving you.

"Yeah, I'm a little surprised at all the comments saying ""just do it"", or ""don't do it"".  This sounds like more of a nuanced issue and something that should be decided in a discussion between the parents."
"I hope that the “Moonlynne” is a stand-in for the real name, both for privacy’s sake and because that is a weird name.

"If he was concerned about keeping things separate, aka. you having a tenant agreement, why wouldn't he just buy the house? Why on earth is his mother involved? He's a grown ass man."
"&gt;I feel that sort of activity that requires some thinking is more useful to her piece of mind than social media feeds.

Please read what you wrote.  You are basically insulting your GF's intelligence.  Implicit in that is that your choice of hobbies are superior to hers since they involve ""thought"".  My hyperbolic comment is to point out that many video games require little ""thought"" (and I game, so I know).

Sounds like you are chasing after your gamer-flavored manic pixie dream girl down to the *quirky* ""crocheting"".  You don't get to pick what someone enjoys, or how they like to decompress at the end of the day.  If your relationship lacks spark....its not on your GF to find a new hobbie that makes her more interesting to you.  Its on you *both* to communicate what you are lacking and problem solve.  "
"support system is great, but this person will still be the other person with the most influence over your children's behavior. They will pick up his behavior and adopt it themselves.  "
"As other people have said, this isn't really about the cat, it's about your gf not respecting you.

Your girlfriend is acting like a child. Agreeing to something to make you happy then trying to change her mind and force it when its too late. It's selfish, shows she doesn't care about your opinion and preferences as long as she is happy.

Put your foot down, tell her she agreed to there not being a cat and if she pushes the issue, know that her wanting to have a cat 24/7 is more important to her than her feelings for you. She'll probably turn that around on you and act like you care more about not having a cat then having her, but like I said, for you its not about the cat, it's about respect and doing what she agreed to."

"When my SUV was at the dealership having some work done, they gave me a BRAND NEW Nissan Rogue that literally had 8 miles on it as a rental that day.  I almost considered walking the few miles to work that day instead of driving it because I was petrified of driving around a brand new vehicle that wasn't mine.  I drove it, and didn't break 20 most of the time.  

I suspect OP has a different perspective on this truck as it's in his name, it's his responsibility, and he earned the money to buy it.  "
"Is that a thing?

"&gt;I made the mistake of thinking that my DIL would behave the same way as the rest of us did around him especially because his comments to her weren’t that bad compared to his behavior around me or my eldest son.


This was my line of thinking because I was so used to my mother's abuse. She's constantly burning bridges treating everyone like shit and expects people to just forget about it after time passes and doesn't feel remorseful or apologizes."
"Lying to cover up for your flaky bf means that you know he is a flake. You need to decide how much of his behavior you are ok with. 

I don't understand why you didn't stay at your bf's place. You couldn't entertain yourself until his friends left? i understand you were pissed at him but why make your parents have to suffer with your relationship choices?"
"In context to this discussion as a whole, yes, gender has come up multiple times.  I'm merely providing similar examples to try to look at this in a different way.

Your example is kind of a nonsensical extreme.  Its like asking:  is sleep a hobby?  What about meditation?  is that a hobby?

To me the issue is that hobby doesn't have a rigid definition, so people are coming at it from different angles.

"Guns don't make you a fucking super hero, what if the person trying to get in has a gun? Always take the safe option, get yourself somewhere safe, hide, call the fucking police, don't risk being murdered or raped."
"Exactly.  We're talking about a middle name here.  I have a similar tradition in my family (my son has my name as his middle name, my middle name is my father's name, etc).  Family traditions aren't just about ONE person (in this case racist-Ray).

I would find it easy to side with the ""don't honor that jerk!"" argument if you were talking about a first name, something you say/use/see all the time w/ your child... but a middle name?  My son is 7 and I can't remember the last time I thought about his middle name... maybe like 2 or 3 random times a year?

Pick your battles... if it's important to your husband, let him have the middle name tradition."
I've just never heard anyone call it a hobby before today. Hence the TIL
"She sounds just like my niece.  When my mother and I realized that she had a problem we pushed for her to get help.  She's an adult, so we couldn't force her and she swore she would never shoplift if we were with her. 

I eventually completely cut her out of my life, because she was caught shoplifting when my mother was with her.  My mother wasn't arrested as an accessory, but was banned from her favorite store.  It could have negatively affected my career if I was with her and she got caught.

This is one of those times when an ultimatum is appropriate, especially since she is in denial.  She needs therapy, but she will not change unless she wants to."
"Firstly I worked and raised my son as a single parent so looking after an infant does not stop you working. 

Wife is ignoring his feelings. It's not like it's her driving their car or even that it is the only option  for the aunt. She is dismissing OPs valid concerns about insurance etc because it's inconvenient to use a 2 door car. I had a baby in a 2 door car and managed it fine.

If she wants to decide and not consider OP then she buys her own car so she never has to use a 2 door car again. Or tells aunt to go buy a 4 door car."
I understand the bond of an animal quite well. Ive had a great dog for 3 years now and he means the world to me. Her moving in with me is essentially a necessity for her I could have gone on waiting longer but her and her mom don’t really mesh and she’s in school right now so she won’t work. She knew this coming in and still chose to get the cat. And is now trying to go back on her promise. I am totally okay with pretty much any other animal rather then a cat. I honestly don’t want to forgo a relationship and I think if she feels like she’s going back on a promise to the shelter that’s on her not me. She can’t financially provide for the cat so that would fall on me as well. I’m not gonna let that happen. If she really cares about the cat she wouldn’t have got it considering her situation. 
While it could be a mental thing this amateur armchair psycho analyzing is really not helpful. A professional should sort that out with OP and her husband
"Yeah,  except that is his issue to deal with, not make his partner's life hell over it.  "

"&gt; cats are a lot cleaner than dogs, they spend hours grooming themselves. As long as she worms and fleas it regularly you would probably barely notice it as they are very independent.

He doesn't like cats. He didn't post asking to be convinced why he should like cats. It's his right to not want them in his space which he told his girlfriend and she still went and got one."

"I would really hammer home the consequences to her career if she gets caught. That's what made me quit. I shoplifted for yeeeaaars (early teens to mid 20s) and felt like I was really good at it and it was so easy. Then I started a good career trajectory and realized how fucked I'd be if there was a theft charge on my record, and quit cold turkey.

But like the other posters are saying, she has to want to quit."
"Calm the fuck down, nobody is getting embarrassed over that small misunderstanding

Ok, even if talking about that, he didn't ask for her parents permission, he asked for their blessing.  You can't have it both ways, that he fucked up by planning a surprise proposal next month and also fucked up by not proposing.   If that's really why she's ghosting him then I can list  about 1000 ways she fucked this up even worse. "
"If you're anywhere in the united states, he could very well already potentially get into trouble if people were to find out that you are having sex. But it would depend on the state. If you are elsewhere, I'm unsure of what the laws are. And I know you don't think so, but it is really not a good thing that he decided to start dating a 12 year old. As someone who got into a relationship with an older man at the age of 16, please realize that this won't be good for you in the long run. "
"&gt; You guys been together for 7 years. She told you immediately. No sugar-coating, no prompting from you.

Doesn't change it. That's like saying ""I committed a crime, I came and told the police right away. I should get out of being sentenced because I was so forthcoming.""

We face consequences for the actions we already took, not how we react afterwards. While telling OP was a good thing, it in no way takes away from the severity of what she did.

&gt;7 years with no flaws is a lot to end over a drunken mistake (being drunk isn’t an excuse, of course. But let’s not pretend being drunk doesn’t lower your inhibitions and lead you to doing stupid shit).

Nothing is unredeemable if the other party doesn't want it to be, so that's not really a good reason to stay. Getting drunk absolutely lowers your inhibitions, but it doesn't make a faithful person a cheater. Been drunk plenty of times, never cheated. You remove yourself from potentially bad situations and control your intake. Again, if you committed a crime when drunk, do you get to use that to avoid consequences? You're right, 7 years is a lot of time. Enough time that she should value her relationship enough to make better choices. She already showed she was willing to risk it to make out with someone, I don't see why the onus is on OP now to hold it together."
"They presented him with an itemized bill, so I'm going to assume he has shitty, shitty parents and this is for real."
"I would label this a major misunderstanding coupled with bad timing, BUT your boyfriend's reaction is kind of...how do I put this delicately? He's being pretty damned insensitive and now trying to imply there is something wrong with you for the types of dreams you have. That coupled with the whole ""I thought it was okay to do since you've done it me,"" while ignoring that you both had discussed it with him, whereas he didn't discuss it with you beforehand and now his trying to make you feel bad are pretty big red flags.

My husband sometimes has nightmares. He has been known to flail out during these and hit me on accident once or twice. I would never dream of making him feel guilty or wrong for that. It's not voluntary and it's not like he sets out to do that on purpose. Instead I try to wake him with my voice from a safe distance, then once he's cognizant I will hold him and soothe him back to sleep.

That your boyfriend couldn't see you were in distress and is now trying to make less of your distress is what I find disturbing. And coupled with the whole ""You did it to me, so I thought it was okay to do to you,"" again if he had apologized and said it was his screw up, then yeah okay. Mistakes happen. But he's trying to make you feel bad for being upset and not giving him what he wanted and that's what is not okay about this whole thing.

And as to what people dream, hell that's not a voluntary thing and last time I checked there was no contract that says well\-adjusted normal human beings don't have bad dreams or nightmares. This is something I assume everyone knows or should. 

Personally his reaction reads like someone pouting he didn't get what he wanted and now trying to guilt you into your reaction, which is very understandable. Don't apologize, maybe it's time to take a step back and really look at this guy and review the relationship to make sure there haven't been earlier red flags you sort of explained away or ignored."
"Well, while I'm sure there are benefits re: bonding/comfort, etc, there are zero peer-reviewed studies indicating that breastfeeding is more beneficial in terms out nutrition/health outcomes past one year vs simply a balanced diet of solids - literally zero studies that control for parental income and education. (There are studies w/very limited sample sizes in favor extended breastfeeding in areas like Rwanda and rural Bangladesh, where access to clean water isn't reliable, and in those cases, of course breastfeeding is more beneficial - but I'm assuming OP isn't in one of those places). That's why I say there's no known benefits (over a balanced diet of solids), as of yet. Because there simply aren't; studies don't bear it out. "

"&gt;her own reasons

You mean tearing her vagina so bad that sex is still painful? 

Or do you mean the fact that her husband is a shit dad? 

Or is it that she's still in school?

Maybe you meant to bring up how she does all night feedings and she's still exhausted? 

Perhaps you meant to talk about her destroyed body??

Seriously dude. For some women pregnancy is traumatic. That is more than enough reason for a caring spuse to re-evaulate their previous agreement. The fact that he's pressuring her to have children while sex is still painful is fucking disgusting. Not to mention he called he dramatic for having a panic attack. "
This! This is so important because now that she knows he wants a baby this bad OP needs to protect herself and take preventative measures.
"Don’t assume that your sons emotional health will suffer due to the absence of his mother. Maybe this will be good for you and them. I don’t think living in a single parent household is worse than living with a parent with significant issues. 

Good luck with it all, I don’t really have any advice except that it will get easier over time and the first weeks and months are the hardest so just take them day by day. "

"Stigma implies people being kind of outcasted/ashamed to talk about it. Basically, it carries really negative connotations for the person suffering from herpes.

However, there shouldn't be a stigma around it."
Probably not since he went on the date with 24...
"&gt; I've asked her to stop, tried to reassure her, suggested counseling, but she won't stop.

Did you actually apologize to her? Meeting a female subordinate almost half your age for dinner and drinks for whatever reason is inappropriate, and not telling your wife makes it suspicious. It doesn't sound like you think you did anything wrong, which is probably partially what your wife's upset about."
"If I were you, I'd file for a hasty divorce. But, real talk, you're probably not going to change her mind, because you don't just randomly decide to join a white supremacy group. This is likely something she's always identified with, and has just now decided to follow through with. 

Are you okay with that? If not, your relationship has probably reached the end. But, you're not going to talk her out of racism. And the alternative is to be married to someone who... is racist, and also involved in a group that promotes that, and worse.

 If yes, I have nothing further to add to this, because JESUS. 

Also, I'm sorry, OP, this is messed up.
"
"If you need to have a boundary between personal and professional settings, why is he calling you on your work phone and during work retreats?"
"Yes, OP, it's blackmail. Except your wife's the blackmailer:

&gt; if I won't have another child, she'll have to ""go somewhere else"".

She's basically saying she'll cheat on you if you aren't willing to have another baby with her.

I'm sorry. FWIW, **definitely** don't have another baby with your wife until/unless this is fixed! Right now your marriage looks really rocky. I know you've already been going to solo counseling, but for things to work out, you guys desperately need to be in joint counseling (and also sounds like your wife needs solo counseling of her own).

If your wife isn't willing to go to counseling and/or things don't improve, I recommend seriously considering divorce. Don't stay in a marriage where you ""feel very much a second-class citizen within the house."" It's not good for you and it won't be good for your son either.

Best wishes."
This change of thought is so drastic that I would absolutely tell your husband (he has a right to know) and seek immediate help for whatever mental stress you are going through. I beg you don’t hide this from your husband or try to sweep these feelings under a rug. 
"I'm an adult, and I don't agree at all. Saying that you wouldn't do X even if you were able is a valid answer to ""what kind of x would you do if you could?"". 

For example answer this: ""which animal would you torture if you could torture an animal?""

For most of us the answer is that you wouldn't, even if you could.

If the teacher wanted to force a description of change the format should have been ""if you *had to*"".

Not only that, but it's not like OP is crazily out in left field here. It's a pretty common answer.

Not wanting to change an aspect of one's past isn't that unusual, especially amongst people who are familiar with sci fi and factor in the butterfly effect or the fact that one's current self is this exact configuration (so changing something = ceasing to exist as yourself).

"Maybe try less hard, talk to the people and hangout with the people that stuck up for you. Be less confrontational and dont make it look like your trying to fit in. It makes you overcompensate, just chill and you'll br better off. People can see through people who are trying too hard. Don't leavr, that's just running away. Staying in would be better, and work on yourself and people's opinions will change."
I was like what? He's like whoa whoa listen you can get it from a  toilet seat. I was appalled and later he asked me to not share it with anyone else and that it was between us.
"To be honest, my BF came home and looked stressed and unsatisfied daily...he would come home and give the stressed out sigh, crack a beer, and lay down from the stress of home after his day at work. He sat me down and said that it stresses him out...I personally wanted him to come home and not feel that way...so even though I could come home and not notice the mess, I asked him what he notices, so then, one by one, with MUCH positive reinforcement from him, I began to do the dishes, or clean up the dog hair, ect. I started to clean equal to the amount he did. My reward was him coming home and giving me a smile and being so thankful for my effort. While, maybe, I will still leave my daily clothes on the floor or something, it does not bother him as much because he sees that I am putting in he effort to meet his standards. Now I am learning how to crate a very homey nice feeling and developing an interest in making my home a place to be proud about."
"move out asap and then divorce lol. 

\&gt; Another significant detail might be that she holds a fairly high position for a big corporation and is somewhat known in the public eye

not for long.  once this becomes public...which it most surely will\-she won't be in that position for long. 

You should divorce her before this becomes public and fired. then you probably won't have to worry about alimony."
"You just need to kiss him. I know that's a terrifying concept, and it feels like you need to confess your feelings first, but that's just your brain being anxious. Don't listen to it.

From your description of the situation, he will definitely appreciate a kiss. You're good to go. Invite him over, put on a movie (lighthearted classics are ideal here, I suggest Star Wars or something). Once the movie is underway, gradually snuggle up to him. Stay snuggling for a while, then put your hand on his cheek and gently turn his face toward you, then kiss him!

Once you have that out of the way you can each talk about your feelings, determine the relationship status and all that stuff.

You can do this!"
"I think this is important, I don't know why but I get the feeling he could get violet if his free ride is suddenly gone, keep the door locked and be ready to call the police if you need to. Stay safe OP and good luck with your breakup... You'll be better off without a horrible guy like this!!"
"&gt; i am so blinded by the possibiloty of us coming out the other side stronger

Tough love time: you won't.

&gt;like he keeps assuring me. 

He's lying. Even if he means it at the time, deep down, he's lying 

 Alcoholics don't change unless they want to, which usually means hitting rock bottom. As long as you're staying with him, that won't happen.

If you refuse to leave then you just have to accept that this is your life now. Forever and and ever, until the day you die."
"That's quite possibly the worst, most insensitive thing you could do, with her in a precarious situation, especially having already ignored and lied to her. "

It's not about trust at all. It's about his anxiety. "
"Uhhh, considering at any point your asthma or allergies could have potentially forced your airway to close therefore putting you at risk of suffocation and possibly death, I’d say yes, but to give the benefit of a doubt were they acutely aware that you were allergic to animals or was it just generalized that you had asthma and doctors thought you’d just grow out of it? Also, as a devil’s advocate, could you have possibly grown out of the asthma and allergies at the same time you moved out or are you still allergic to animals today?
Edit: spelling and punctuation."
"My boyfriend had been away for a few weeks once and when he came back, he couldn't keep his hands off of me. I kept saying I needed a minute, and he kept just grabbing, caressing and undressing me. 6-7 requests and I yelled at him. He finally stopped and felt bad, but I never got over it and I never felt safe with him again. 


He felt bad, but I literally couldn't sleep with him for another week because I said no and he ignored me. It's not the same situation. But even when you trust someone and know it was not their intention, sometimes trust is just broken. I ended things a few months later. I'm not sure if it was right, but I couldn't be emotionally vulnerable. 


Also, it sounds like your nightmare was about him molesting you in your sleep, at least, your dream seems like it was about you feeling trapped and unable to fight back. "

"I know, right? Rent should be from the moment of conception - he had full room&amp;board in that uterus and he should damn well pay for it!"
"I don’t know why you keep saying if they ‘seperate’. They are already separated and have been for years so that should be easy enough to prove. He should be able to get an uncontested divorce almost immediately.

Frankly, I wouldn’t stay just for a ‘seperation’. So what? Doesn’t mean he’ll follow through with an actual divorce in the future. You can’t even begin to build any kind of life with him until he is divorced. Unless you want to give her half of what *you* have built with him. 

"
"What happens if after another month of dating, you realize you missed being in a relationship, not that you missed him specifically. So you break his heart and break up with him again. Honestly if I were giving the guy advice, I would tell him to find closure and cut contact. Because only then can you stop hurting him"
The whole ignoring her calls and texts alone would be enough to have me reconsidering this relationship. 
"He is the adult in this situation and he preyed on you being young and vulnerable. It’s not your fault he’s a creeper.Tell your mom , is your mom close with this person? "
Oh wow. It actually has to do with everything. His parents are trying to get money from your parents in a very roundabout way. 
"Ah yes, the old classic:

""My girlfriend is pressuring me for sex when I don't want it.""

""Awesome, bro! High five!""

"Last time something extremely similar to this was posted the top rated comments gave the intoxicated cheater a free pass because apparently being drunk gives you carte blanche to avoid accountability. I disagree.

I think in all cases like this the drunk partner is just as fault as they otherwise would be, if not more so. Here's something to ask yourself. If she got drunk, got behind the wheel of a car and hurt someone, would it be any more or less forgivable because she was drunk? People need to control their intake, avoid situations where they may misbehave and if that isn't possible for them then they need to not drink. Your girlfriend was capable of making better choices but she didn't, now she's using the alcohol and party environment as an excuse.

She was upset and crying because she knew she had to come clean. A lot of people probably saw and the chance you'd find out from someone was high. I'd cry too if I knew my relationship was about to end due to my stupidity, but her tears add no value to this situation. Avoid falling for the sunk cost fallacy and ignore anyone who puts the burden to forgive *on you* as if leaving would be wrong.

OP, she cheated. Plain and simple. The trust is gone. How can you trust her to go out without you or have a drink from now on? If you cannot get past that, leave. None of her excuses turn back time.

"
"nah, not if it's going to stress her out. the most important thing is that she and the baby have the safest, least stressful experience possible. he doesn't get to be in the room if she doesn't want him. "
"Honestly, I feel like his reputation is likely already tainted.  If she’s well known enough, that is."
"Weed is her deal breaker. For whatever reason, she doesn't want to be with someone who smokes weed. There's nothing wrong with that, just like there's nothing wrong with you smoking weed. What is wrong, though, is making a promise and then going back on it. She wouldn't ask you to make that promise if it wasn't important to her, and it obviously very much is. If you want to stay in this relationship, then you know the price of admission. If smoking pot is something that you want to keep in your life, then you two are incompatible and should break up.

For what it's worth, I agree with your girlfriend that weed is a crutch for you. The fact that you can't enjoy your free time without being high is very telling. I understand that weed helps you, you shouldn't have to rely on it to get through your day. That's indicative of an unsustainable lifestyle and/or mental illness. You should speak with your doctor about your thoughts and depression; they'll be able to determine if you have some kind of underlying mental illness, or they'll recommend you to someone who can. They can then start you on an effective treatment plan to actually treat the problem, instead of dulling the symptoms with weed.

Even if you have no underlying mental illness and it's just stress from work, therapy can be immensely helpful in giving the you tools to deal with stress and depressive thoughts. After all, you can't be high all the time, especially at work where most of your stress probably comes from. Simple lifestyle changes, like exercise and diet, can also make a big difference. And just to clarify, I'm *not* saying that you need to stop smoking weed; I'm saying that you shouldn't ignore possible underlying mental issues because you think have everything under control (you don't, that's why you smoke)."
Yes for sure!! I won't be used as a muppet and get my heart played with like a guitar. He's graduating very very soon so I'm relieved. 
"But he's willing to appease his parents at YOUR expense.  He's willing to sacrifice YOUR futures without your input.  You need to make sure he knows that you love him, but that doesn't mean he can take you for granted.  Because marriage requires him to reciprocate that love, and he isn't if his shitty parents are more of a priority to him than you are.  He needs to know there will no longer be peace in your home if he wants to make peace with his parents this way."
"If he's going to put in minimal effort into a relationship, he only deserves a break up that is minimal effort. "
"You two are simply incompatible.  Break up with him and move on.

No amount of therapy will overcome your never going to be able to meet his standards."

That ex is gonna be part of your step-daughter's whole life, thus part of your husband's whole life, thus part of *your* whole life. Make peace with that, or your marriage will be nasty, brutish, and short. 

""Let it go"" is literally your only  option here that does not lead to divorce.

"&gt;One of the friendlier women, usually greets me very openly, did not even acknowledge my existence, none of them did until I said hi to another woman, but even then she was the only one to reply to me. It was odd, and ***frankly humiliating*** now that I look back.

Get a grip.

You're having huge overreactions to things that are small slights.

&gt;The woman brought this up, and my wife says ""he decided to drive around the country side instead."" Uh no, WE decided to get away together and spend some time alone.

People use their partners as an excuse all the time. If you have a specific issue with that, sure. If you think this is 'gaslighting' then, again, get a grip.

&gt;she claims I am just seeing what I want to.

Sounds like she's right.

&gt;if you feel that way then leave and dont come back.

This is considerably worse than anything she said or did to you."
Being drunk is not an excuse to any kind of bad behavior. 
"She sounds terrible. Lesson learned, though, eh? When you’re sick, stay home instead of catering to people who think you’re their servant. "
I think these may be too subtle for this guy.
"I was really good friends with a former co-worker until he started tossing that phrase around. It's super inappropriate and unprofessional. I'm gay, so I'm sure he just thought it was funny but we were both engaged at the time. Boundaries are important and I couldn't tell what was a joke and what was him coming onto me after that. Nobody wants that."
"You can also phrase it as, ""I might be misreading the situation, but ______."" That gives him a graceful out, while calling him on the behaviors. It's not your job to cater to his feelings, but it might help the peace at work."
"Don't worry, that's why you come to Reddit. We'll do allllll your judging for you!"
"Yes this! So many replies are just about how this isn’t OP’s problem and he should just ignore it. That’s true, but would you rather be “right” and take the moral high ground or be just a little understanding to her family’s plight?  

Of course, you restricting your social media won’t solve the root problem, but at the end of the day at least you can say you’ve done what you could. 

And I’d suggest just being frank with your fiancée about this. If she’s also a kind lady, I’m sure she will understand. "

"My answer to your question post title - make time for yourself.  Spend a couple weeks focusing on what you like to do and do more of it - reading, working out, going to the movies with friends, whatever.  Be open to spending whatever time with him he asks for but stop chasing him/begging him to be together.  Sometimes a little distance gives someone a different perspective - he may realize that if he doesn't start making time for you that you're going to find other interesting things to do (and eventually people to do them with).  Or you may find that you're better able to handle the reduced time together when you have other things as your priority.  Or one /both of you may find this relationship is really over and it's time to give it up.  
 
But long story short - asking / talking to him / making overtures isn't working so see if a little distance might."
"can’t fault her for moving on when you’re the one that ended it. plus your in-affection probably made it easier for her to move on so quickly. it’s all good my dude, there’s plenty of bats in the cave "

Hey uhhh, you sort of literally described the behavior transcending outside of sports in this situation. "
Most of those teens don’t actually go hit on actual gay dudes though. One would hope. Oh god. 
"This might be a bit harsh and I’m not a parent but I was a bad teen. I grew up out of it fast when instead of having things taken away I was given responsibility. 

So other than the people suggesting counseling which is a great idea, I’ve got an alternative. It’s a play on what helped me to grow out of it very quickly.

Do they have jobs? If they don’t have them get one, they’ll need it for this. Charge rent in the house as long as they behave like this. Let’s say 3-400 a month each. Missed rent? Send them to a relatives house until they get the money. 


No family nearby? If you live in a warm area set up a tent outside where they can sleep. Just to sleep because otherwise it would just be petty and cruel in my opinion.

If it works, all that money can go back to them towards schooling.


Moving out of my house at 17 and having rent to pay helped me mature faster than I could’ve imagined. When I came to visit my parents they noticed a huge difference even after the first rent check was due.  Being an adult is tough and you realize how good you have it at home.

NO ONE USES TINDER FOR FRIENDS. NO ONE USES MATCH FOR FRIENDS. Your husband is lying to your face.
"I wouldn't say that you ""didn't express judgement"", I think you expressed a lot of judgement. Like even here, relayed in text from a calm nuetral retrospection, the way you describe saying ""well I have a lot of siblings so if I have to support you I have to support all of them"", I can totally imagine how her saying that must have hit you like a punch in the face, the way you must have taken a long second to plan that (totally fantastic and accurate) response, I'm sure every fraction of a second and tiny twitch in your face must have been gigantic to her

It's pretty clear that she didn't think enough about her life plan and she basically was spitballing ideas with you and when her idea was ""be a lazy leech and live off of you forever"" and you responded how any human would, she felt judged. Because she was. And this sounds like it's been a long time coming for her

Let her cry in her studio, she needs a dose of reality. This is her bed, she's gotta sleep in it. Pointing out the bed that she's sleeping in is on fire is not your fault, you didn't set it on fire. If it burns to sleep in it, that's on her and not on you"

"this will be unpopular, but I agree with you - we did weekly dinners at my parents until my dad died (I was 28?) - I would give ANYTHING for one more.  I see my mom at least once a week because I know what it's like to not get anymore time with someone.

If the answer to all of those is yes, and you don't think he's lying, then you're fine.  He just wants the parents to feel included, and you don't have a problem.

If instead he sort of fumbles around or tries to come up with reasons why that doesn't make sense, then you have your answer.  It's just part of the sexist tradition, and you should go ahead and ignore it."

"So .. when I was a teenager, I found the best way to shut up someone was to build up on what they were saying, showing them how you didnt really mind and what they were saying were actually stupid. 

As an example, a friend kept telling me how big of a nose I had. It would get to me, I felt ugly. My brother gave me this advice and next time she told me I had a big nose, I answered : I know right ? Instead of tissue, I have to use bedsheets to blow it up ! It is horrible ! 

Everyone laughed but her and no one ever told me my nose was big again. 

I would call her out, saying something like : I know right, I can totally speak to him on your behalf ! (I dont know if your mom is in the picture) Maybe he would leave my mom for you and you can be my new mom !

You could even tell your dad and make them uncomfortable. Nothing too inappropriate but tell him in front of her how she was just saying how sexy he was (tell him in advance though). That will shut her up... she might get pissed but its on her."

YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO jfc you're their boss. It's so tough in these instances but all you can do is keep documenting evidence. Write notes with dates and times of errors she makes, collect email ""receipts"", and just keep tabs on her. Make sure it's clear what you need out of the situation. If after the meeting it doesn't go your way, talk to your boss and say ""this is not a miscommunication we are having, I need this resolved, it makes my job more difficult to manage with her around right now, give me some solutions to my problem, not a solution to what you think my problem is"" (except nicer and more professionally because it's your boss, just make sure to get these points across or they won't get it).

"Please listen to me, as a woman your teacher's age who works with people slightly older than you, this woman is grooming you for a coercive, toxic, potential statutory rape situation. She is an abuser, and she is trying to manipulate you into feeling sorry for her so that she can have you under her control. A teacher who was not an abusive monster would not ask you to stay in her home under any circumstances, nor would she invite you over alone to watch a movie. Those are HUGE no nos, because a teacher who is not a predator wants to avoid even the slightest hint of inappropriate behavior. You need to tell the principal everything in this post. She needs to be fired. There's a very real chance that if she doesn't sleep with you, she'll sleep with another student, and mess someone up VERY badly.

Sure there were some times I didn't demonstrate spatial awareness, but there were plenty of times that I did, yet all he chose to see were the times I wasn't. In any case, you should break up with her because you clearly do not accept her the way she is. He was also very critical of me and I would get butthurt, however had he approached it a different way, it would have been completely different. Oftentimes people go on the defensive because of the way YOU are being. And with him, I felt like I always had to prove myself because anything that wasn't logical to him automatically was dismissed. He wasn't a bad guy and I know he had the best intentions, but I couldn't stand how I felt as a person around him, because I ended up feeling like everything I did was constantly scrutinized. It was like he put me in a box and all I could ever be was that...no matter how much I tried to improve on things. There is absolutely nothing wrong with how she is - she's just not for you. What is ""common sense"" to you may not be common sense to everyone else. How are you even helping her by being critical other than making her feel attacked? Anyways, just giving my side as the ""dumb, clueless"" girlfriend."
"This is what I'm like blown away by too tbh. His wife said he could open up his end sexually but instead he got in a fully committed relationship and even has the kids calling her mom? 

He wants to have his cake and eat it too, and even though it's been working so far, it doesn't sound like it will continue to be an option."
"Oh, he has sex with her but only if it's a threesome. Like she's some novelty. He left that part out of the post, but mentions it later. "
This letter is insanely self\-serving. It's purely for your own gain and honestly you need to leave this situation alone. Stop beating a dead horse. 
"I like this approach best.  You can only change your reaction.  If this stuff is all in her head, I think she could use individual therapy to work through her personal issues.  And, address it every time, then walk away.  Provide consistent responses and consequences to bad behavior."
"She is having some sort of psychotic break and possibly showing schizophrenic symptoms as well. She needs help right now. 

Are you on good terms with her mom or dad?  Does she have any trustworthy friends? What kind of health insurance does she have?   You need to find a few people to be on your team, and get her diagnosed and into treatment ASAP. She may be a danger to your kid, her mom, or herself.  "
"What's disgusting is placing the onus on the wife to forgive, not on the BIL to grovel."
"He told her because it was her sister, she would've found out about it regardless. I don't think he gets points for that. "
"He is making the smart decision here. You should not move for an LDR that's only been a few months. BUT, if you want to move anyway, and this is a city you would be interested in living In, you definitely shouldn't live with him. I would give the same advice to someone moving for LDR of multiple years.


I would never want to live with someone without knowing how they live. Seeing how they clean and pay bills. Seeing how we are spending nights together and grocery shopping together and if our social lives fit together. You should be developing your life outside of him in case it doesn't work out. "
"I learned this the hard way, but listen to what he’s telling you and don’t try to read his actions. I had a fwb who wanted to introduce me to all of his friends, kiss and hold hands with me in public, he told me he confided in me a lot, told his mom about me, told me I was a keeper and that he’d be dumb if he let me go, etc. Well of course I ended up falling for him and I told him and he said that all of that didn’t mean he wanted anything more with me..."
Because they lack impulse control and are good at compartmentalizing?
He definitely has another girlfriend/wife/kids. 
"I’ve been in this situation and I can tell you *no, you’re not a bad person for breaking up with her*, especially when you’ve done everything in your power to help her. It took me almost 4 *years* before the phrase “you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped” registered in the emotional part of my brain and I was ready to break up. 

&gt; that’s “just who she is”

From what I gather from your post she hasn’t even tried therapy or any other treatment. She sees no problem with her behavior towards you or towards herself. If you want to give it one last try, sit her down and make it clear that you’ve hit a breaking point and refusing therapy is not an option for you. Get a backup plan so you can leave when things go south, as it’s not unlikely they will. Please take care with any legal obligations you take on when moving in together."
"I mean, there's nothing particularly useful about insecurity, but it's also completely human. It's a valid emotion in the sense that it's normal to feel insecure every now and again. Sure, it can be a good thing to work on, but someone who never feels the tiniest twinge of insecurity would probably be a complete narcissist.  "
"He spent the whole post rationalizing what he actually wants to do, which is go to college, not have kids. He should let the girlfriend go and figure out where he stands on the issue so she can move on and have the family she wants. "
apparently all he had to do was be in the same building and JUST HAPPENED. it's not like he had to ejaculate inside her vagina or anything.
"&gt; OP's already acknowledged and accepted her failing.

Lol, no she hasn't.  She referred to it as ""a moment of weakness"" and a ""mistake"".  Give me a fucking break."

"But she's acting as if she is 100% perfect, and that you are just some guy lucky enough to be serving her. Don't you see why that's a problem?

Nobody is perfect but adults in a healthy relationship can talk about things that bother them in a rational way, and agree to work things through together. "
"Honestly? You aren't going to ""talk"" her back into your life. You can't control her actions, you can only control yours. Start being busy. Stop being so available to her all the time and she might start to regret what she's missing. Go out with your friends. Go out with other people. Join a softball team. Go bowling. Go do things and she might regret spending her life with her nose pointed at a device.

If you have a fun life, she might want to join you.

"I don't know the structure of your group, or where you're located, but if you have the power to ban him, you might be large enough to be legally liable for his actions if he hurts someone. You know he's a sexual predator (or at least willing to be blithely oblivious to a woman's discomfort in pursuing his sexual goals). If he goes a few steps further later, after you've been warned and let him back in, some of that shitstorm might rain on you.

Not to mention the whole  ethical problem of giving a known scumbag a chance  to hurt someone."

"I think you're right but I think the other guy is also right.  He does seem concerned that people would just leave without talking to him -- but he's also still considering letting Ralph stay! So he definitely would've at least thought about just smoothing things over if the girl did complain to him.  

I personally wouldn't have told OP, either.  I've just experienced this before more than one and so many dudes are just gonna side with the other dude in the end and hope nobody makes waves and messed up the ""dynamic"".  They're not terrible people but read OP's post -- that's the instinct he has, too. Edit: I should note that it looks like OP is going to do the right thing and that's really awesome of him!  But it's just not most people's first instinct and most people aren't going to examine it beyond that point."

"Something tells me someone else paid for her schooling and maybe gave her a decent chunk of pocket money as kid, so she never learned these basics. "
"Oh please, on your second bullet. No decent person asks their partner to move in with them then starts hounding them for rent when they’re able to pay the bills without them."
"You are exactly right and I think sometimes people need this kind of perspective spelled out for them. I can see how OP might think it’s the men’s happiness vs the women’s happiness, when in fact it is the men’s convenience vs the women’s safety. It’s managing disappointment vs fear. "
"Hun, being trans you are inherently part of the queer community. You may not do 'anything' in the community and just ignore everything but transphobes won't give a fuck about that. Simply existing as queer pisses those kind of people off and they will seek to harm you over it- a conservative country like Egypt will be even worse, especially since your bf wants to cut you off from any other support them himself.

"Okay, I was just looking for clarification. That makes sense then, having to give her dedicated time on a schedule. Tough spot, but understandable.

Hate to hear about the hostility directed towards you, but maybe this language barrier being fixed will ease things."
"He’s been grieving for five years...  he’s a grown man.  And can date who he wants...if she makes him happy, that should be your only concern.  "
"No, don't let him back into the group. If he made such good friends with the men they can get together outside of your social club.  Ralph sounds like quite the manipulator.  He's harrassed 3 women in your group in less than a year. That's not a fluke nor a coincidence; that's who he is."
"So you take his eating when he is not around you as being disrespectful of your struggle?

Or do you feel like he is tempting you?  "
"To be honest, I think the ‘well I make backups of my stuff so it’s kinda hard to do’ is a weak excuse - it sounds like you just don’t want to, in which case I’d say that rather than pretend there’s something preventing you from doing so. "
"Yeah, I just looked it up and he can’t even do this job in our state without a license. The fact that he doesn’t even know that is very upsetting. "
"Your wife has some serious issues, dude. She’s the one who needs help."
"Therapy would be great, but we're talking about fairly extreme situations here.  It's entirely possible to live a perfectly happy and functional life without ever having to dangle 10+ feet in the air.

If she never gets over her fear of heights, that's totally ok.  Might not work for a relationship with this guy, but that's fine too.  If he's 100% committed to dating a climbing buddy, it could easily be a dealbreaking compatibility issue."
"Afraid not. I don’t think links are allowed, but if you look up fertility graphs/charts, you’ll see a clear decline that only picks up speed with age."
"You honestly sound like a really thoughtful guy. But I guarantee you that money doesn’t buy happiness.  It will never buy hers. 

I think what your wife wanted was to be able to show her friends how much you dote on her. “You guys! Look what he did! He flew us out to Cabo for my birthday! I had no idea! I am so hashtag blessed!” She wanted your attention. And her friends’ envy. 

However, her reaction is very childish. There’s no getting around it. Kids are going to bed hungry in this country. If they have a bed. Some sleep on sofas. Some are homeless. I think you are spot on about not being wasteful. Maybe y’all should go someplace and help build an irrigation system. See how the other 99% lives. I mean that with all due respect. "
"Coming from a childless woman that married a man with full custody of two teenaged daughters with the ex out of the picture - - end it now if you can't deal.

Just tell her how you feel. "
"He did too do it maliciously. She'd already told him she didn't like being hurt and degraded/didn't understand his need to do so. Remember, the boyfriend also flatly ignored her boundary about pregnancy talk.

You are an ethical kinkster. There are plenty of ethical kinksters. And there are plenty of assholes in every subculture. It's foolish to pretend otherwise."
"I mean, he was pretty severely traumatized and mentally broken by the death of his parents and being raised alone. He's violent, reclusive, and dresses like a bat. He can't respect any authority or really trust anyone, and the only reason we think of him as a hero is because he hurts people more violent than he is and he has cool gadgets. Maybe not the best character to emulate...

"&gt; The faking probably affects the stats on vaginal orgasms greatly. Faking orgasms is probably more common than not

Yup, and as a woman, it pisses me off so much because then I have to play the bad guy or the liar.  Either I tell the guy that it's not working for me, which makes him feel bad or inadequate, or I tell him it's not working and he comes up with 'well it's worked before' and then he has to go to A&amp;E to have the shoe removed from his rectum. "
"I married one :-( thankfully I chose better second time round. My ex husband would tell you until he was blue in the face that I was to blame for our break up and would paint himself as the poor blameless victim.

I won’t go into details about why I actually left as my comment would turn into a novel!"
"One can only invite so many times.  It's not your job to go begging after him, trying to coax him into getting involved.  He was uninvolved from the beginning, as you're describing, then gets all pissed off because he doesn't get to move a couch on move-in day?

And we have a bunch of guys saying how they'd not feel included?

How many times does the woman have to chase you to include you before she's ""allowed"" (gag) to give up and just do her thing?

Unbelievable."
This is a really creative solution and I appreciate it.

"This is what happens when you betray someone. People tend to take it personally. 

I understand where people are coming from when they recommend telling your ex about the video, but he doesn't want to talk to you. Telling his parents or friends is not going to make him feel better, and he probably won't thank you for it if this becomes widely known. No, I think you trying to tattle on your former friend is what you'd be doing, and he would be able to tell instantly. I just don't see where it benefits you, or how you come out ahead.

&gt;Is there any hope left? With my best friend? With my Ex? Why would she turn her back to me like this?

Move on. Two relationships are burned down. It's possible to rebuild them later, but given what's already occurred I would doubt it. These are the consequences of your action, and it means you're done with both of them, or, they are both done with you. I'm not sure why she would turn her back on you other than you revealed yourself to be a shitty person by cheating. She must have been hurt, although I can't speculate why. It's possible she was jealous of your BF the whole time. It's possible she has really strong feelings about cheating. It's possible that her motivations are neither of those. It doesn't matter much why she did it, it matters more what you do next."

Let your parents be angry; it's their own damn fault for being shitty. hypocritical parents.

"My MIL is this way with my wife. MIL has relatively fair olive skin with straight dark brown hair, but FIL has a darker complexion and had black curly hair before he went grey and mostly bald. My wife got the black curly hair (which honestly looks great on her, even when unkempt) and relatively dark olive skin. MIL would wonder why she didn't have blond kids with straight hair and my wife would say ""Look in the damn mirror and at the guy you married!"" And yes, MIL is the narcissistic/justnoMIL type. What's hilarious is that, with my white-ass genes, our daughter ended up with copper-blond straight fine hair (lighter than mine!), and MIL is jealous of my daughter. I'm actually glad she doesn't favor my daughter because of it, but she still plays favorites with the grandkids. My wife is glad that we live half way around the world from them.

OP, here's the thing, my wife is lovely and attractive just the way she is, and you are too. The crap your family put you through is unfair and offensive, and you are under no obligation to spend any more time with them that you want to. Move out, and life your best life. Be yourself, do your hair the way you want to. And don't worry about the shade of your skin looks. Investing in your health by exercising and eating healthy food will make your skin glow, imperfections and all. Just own it, and women will find you attractive."

Both of your examples with a dog involved a physical neglect that endangers them. But that doesn't seem to be what's happening with your sister. You seem really antagonistic to people's questions asking for more detail to figure out where on the sliding scale your sisters neglect lies - there is no reason to take out your frustrations on people actually trying to help you. And from your attitude it's hard not to think you are entitled or exaggerating by the way you are you are trying to avoid simple questions about your post
"It sounds like this is becoming a dealbreaker issue for him and his wife is somehow oblivious. Does she not see that withholding sex and affection is damaging her marriage? Why does she expect her marriage to remain if not intact, than just generally happy, when both parties are not getting their needs met? Emotional and physical needs are equally important in a romantic relationship. It does not sound like this guy is being unreasonable. He's been *very* understanding. She just seems like she really doesn't give a fuck. "
"Thank you for your comment, I really appreciate your point of view - and it’s nice to know I’m not just being needy about this!
My parents have an incredible marriage and while they love both me and my brother unconditionally, they look at each other like they are the others world and their “person” and I think that’s why I’m struggling with the fact that if I do stay with him, I won’t ever experience that.

"This makes me so sad for you that you’re settling for this.  You don’t have to, you know."
I don't think I could trust someone after such lies that she stuck to for eight months. I think it's alright to not like how many or how few sex partners someone's had. Sex is a different thing to different people and it's alright to be put off by someone who clearly has/had a different view of sex.

I agree with the opinion posted as well as your response.  I just wonder how long it will take before sister drops off her kid at your apartment when you move out.  She and her ex sound like a real piece of work.

""Stop. JUST STOP TALKING. PLEASE""

It's like she didn't realize there was NOTHING she could say that would make this ok &gt;.&lt;

Jeez OP, the more you talk, the more you sound more than a little like a narcissist. I suggest you take a step back, maybe turn off all your internet (other than what is absolutely necessary for work), isolate yourself socially for a few days, and try and reflect on your nature, what you want from life, and what you expect from the people you surround yourself with. It really helps sometimes.

He is a jerk. He's angry when you wake him up and he's angry when you let him sleep. Move on. Let the old guy snooze. And find someone who wants a relationship and not a mother.

He doesn't want to move out, if he did he would. 

I realise that may seem harsh, but you've been in this relationship for 18 months and things haven't changed. 

It seems to me now that your choices are to continue with the relationship the way that it is, or move on so you can find someone who can give you the sort of life that you want. "

"I like your wife.

Ever heard the phrase, ""You are who you hang out with""?

It's like the first part of your post you were looking at the camera speaking directly to OP, then you took a sigh, looked into the distance and mused to yourself about how you just don't understand these dumb people.

How is he meeting these women?

"What exactly are you supposed to do for your sister when you guys talked with your parents and they decided to subsidize your housing? Seems like there is an implication if not explicit deal here. 


Even if your sister says she is happy for you and looks forward to the baby that doesn’t mean that the presence of a baby will be good for her. Plus considering that your parents asked you to move in the first place to take care of your sister and they bought an entire house just to make this happen, I’d talk to them asap. 


It’s not just about how happy your parents and sister would be for your pregnancy and baby (because of course they would be) but about how the presence of an infant would get in the way of your sister gaining normalcy and having a safe and quiet space to live and study for school as well as receive care that you promise you would in return for housing. "
"WOOOOOOW yea you're  a troll. This isn't wven about the eating thing anymore. You're literally saying ""She needs to be the way *I* want her to be."" 

You're totally controlling. What if she didn't fold her laundry the way you do. Would that be a problem too?"

"I'm a black women who's dated my fair share of white guys.  The two that did this ended up being racist.  They resent the topic and want to erase the concept from your mind, it makes life more comfortable for them.

It's not worth it and it doesn't get better.  I had one boyfriend who wasn't racist just ignorant, it only took a handful of these conversations for him to come around, and one objection for him to stop playing devils advocate.  I told him he always sympathizes with the accused and not the accuser, and that it said something ugly about his character. He changed immediately. 

The closet racists I dated were so busy trying to pretend I wasn't *really* black, they resented any hint to the contrary. Including my life experiences.  When things don't work out, the ugliness poured out. 

Being gaslighted about racism is damaging and sometimes it can seriously mess up your life.  Can you imagine him having kids? Bad scene."
"When she was married she was cut off. When I visited her it was a surprise visit. I was so shocked to see her in that state and she was devastated that I saw her like that.  She said she had not been able to leave because he controlled all the money and she was unable to work while her visa was being sorted out. 

I'd say though that my sister is not flashy and does not spend money on crap. She works on her charities and pro bono project tirelessly and has done tremendous good with it. My gf is not mad about 'independence' - she's mad that I don't give her an allowance a month or buy her more gifts. I pay for almost everything for us as is."
Because her dog may have irreparable fur damage. It's a bigger deal than you obviously think.
"I did the same thing... I wanted to wait until I was financially stable in case my parents cut me off. However, I was pleasantly surprised (after my bro forced me to come out) that my parents handled it better than I thought. Besides, you can always get loans for college and other things. Best of luck to you, OP!!"
"You're even allowed a tiny bit of alcohol nowadays. Things have changed a bit in the last decade or so.

"Definitely will, thanks for your help!"
"I am not seeing that \*at all\*.  I think your perception is very discolored here.  They're unanimously telling you to leave the relationship and speaking very bluntly, but I see not  a single person judging you for the dislike of kids.  "
Thank you. I'm terrified of change and everything changed at once.
And be sure to give us an update on what you decide and how it goes.
"Nobody asks to be born. The parents make that choice and assume that responsibility. Making sure your kid has a place to live, food to eat, clothes to wear, and a basic education is the bare minimum and nobody should expect praise or gratitude for doing it."
"My guess is that she finally got enough money to get some of the things she always wanted, but found she didn't really know where to start or what her style was.  So, until she figures it out, she likes your taste and style so she's copying it.  Maybe you could offer to go out with her when she goes shopping and point out other styles/brands that might compliment her more.

Either that, or you and her will become the next Brandi Glanville and LeAnn Rimes.  "

"Your parents-in-law sound awful. Not only did they decide to try to take advantage of your money, but apparently they pow wowed with your SIL to talk about how she should take advantage of your money as well? Goodness.

Unfortunately Pandora's box has been opened. You need to say no to any and all requests for money or it will snowball very quickly. And unfortunately, most likely wife's parents and sister will be angry and accuse you of being stingy because you have sooo much money that you can give and in-laws and SIL are sooo in need... wife needs to be prepared for that.

I'm a petty and passive aggressive person. I'd totally leverage your baby and guilt, but that's just me. Example:

OP and wife: 'No, we will not buy you a new car, we need to save for the baby.'

In-laws: 'But you have soooo much money, can't we have a little?'

OP: 'No, it's for baby.'

In-laws: ""Please please please'

OP: 'Every dollar you take from us is food out of our baby's mouth. Would you really do that? Take food from our child? Take money from her college savings, sacrifice her education? Really?' 
"
oh you're just being insecure!   /s
So it’s been 5 years and you still don’t know if you want to marry her or not? Dude....figure this out because you’re literally wasting her life. If you truly don’t know what you want then break up so she can find someone who wants the same life path as her. 
"One of the main problems in my opinion with dating someone with an age gap is that the younger person is less experienced with relationships and doesn’t realize what is normal and acceptable. He might be telling you that you are young and don’t understand something you disagree with, and you’ll believe him, but that might not actually be the case. It seems like the older man often gets away with a lot of things because he paints them as normal in a relationship while his partner doesn’t know any better. "
"She may not have been *trying* to cause drama, but I agree with you that she definitely did. I mean the road to hell is paved with good intentions right?

"Pregnant lady here, who's eating a few of the things on your list (bleu cheese, feta, coffee) and a few no-nos that aren't (bacon). There is no substance in the world that someone, somewhere won't tell you to avoid while pregnant because ""there's a risk."" Well, guess what, everything has a risk. And there's no research on the vast majority of substances (oh no, what if celery is bad for the baby? What if touching daffodils is bad for the baby? What if wearing socks is bad for the baby?) It's infuriating and infantilizing to constantly hear that your every move is harmful, dangerous, irresponsible, when you're just trying to live your damn life while also making a person in your midsection. The whole experience is totally weird and I can't imagine how hard it would be to have OP breathing down my neck for 9 months, especially after having been ambivalent about the pregnancy in the first place. LET HER BE. It'd be great if she took those prenatal vitamins, but if she eats fortified food and meat, she probably has enough folic acid and other nutrients. 

OP, you say ""why does she care about herself more than the baby?"" but why do YOU care about the baby more than your wife? Pressuring her into a pregnancy she didn't want, pressuring her to follow every single little rule, laying on the guilt... Please consider your approach and find ways to support her, not criticize her, during this stressful time. "
"I think it is because of what the above poster said, that Devils advocate is often used as a disingenuous way for people to argue in favor of socially unacceptable things without having to accept the social consequences. 

In my experience, few people truly play Devils Advocate well. For the most part they are either people attempting to be edgy or people who want to play games with peoples beliefs. There are far more productive ways to introduce contrary viewpoints."
"I dated someone who had depression for a while, and from my experience, it is extremely difficult to have a healthy relationship with someone like that. You need clear boundaries and to distance yourself from taking on the therapist role. She wants/needs constant reaffirmation. It is manipulative. from my personal experience, I would not suggest continuing a fairly new relationship with someone like that."
"It seems like he knows you want to be the “cool girlfriend” (i.e. playful, always up for sex, no supposed nagging, etc.) and he’s trying to take advantage of that. 

This just doesn’t sound like a real partnership. You’re doubting your own needs and that’s a huge red flag. "
"OP, as her SO, **you have the duty to tell her this**.  There are various infections and other problems that can cause this **and she needs to know this** so she can seek treatment if she can't fix it herself.

Who the heck else is going to tell her?"
If you can't talk about it with him then you aren't ready to do this with him.
"&gt; I posted about this on r/bipolar and they advised me to leave the relationship because my boyfriend is not comfortable supporting me through my bipolar. My mom says I should try to find a partner who can be there for me in a supportive way.

This likely isn't what you want to hear, but your boyfriend has the right to set boundaries and to not be abused in his own home. I think he's being more understanding than many would be if they had a partner who acted out this way and physically abused them (I would not be understanding of this and it would be a relationship ender for me). Your illness is not your fault, but it doesn't make physical abuse (and emotional cheating, at the very least, it sounds like) OK.  I think your SO is smart to create boundaries that will protect him. Supporting someone with an illness is more than just excusing things/pretending dangerous behavior is OK. That's simply enabling.

That said, if you aren't happy with him and don't feel he's a good partner for you, you should end the relationship. Don't stay with someone you don't want to be with just because you're scared you won't find anyone else.

Re: the financial issue, if he can't afford the condo on his own, he needs to sell it. If he doesn't want to live together anymore, he needs to sell it. You shouldn't be financially responsible for a home you're not living in.

You also left t his out, from your other post:

&gt; My family doesn't like my boyfriend and my mom won't even say ""hi"" to him when bumping into him on the street. This is because of how he acted during a severe mania I had in 2016. 

It sounds like your family is appallingly rude to this man (who, like I said, has every right to make sure he's physically safe) and expects him to simply enable you regardless of your behavior. This sounds like a toxic situation overall and I do think it's best if you end it. Unless he acted abusively (setting boundaries is not abuse) to you, I don't think this is a fair reaction, from you or from them. I find it interesting that you chose to include this info in your post in the other sub but omit the fact that you physically abused him."
"Thank you. My boyfriend has said multiple times it’s easier for him because he never knew her as a functioning adult and only as a lady in diapers who peed on his foot, lol. It does make it easier for him."
"You might be surprised.  My general physical, obgyn, and a specialist all recommended lowering carbs to lose weight.  I'm on the west coast which may help but I was very encouraged and lost 40 pounds, 30 to go.  "
"Except it has the potential to remind OP of the FIL’s attitudes which she clearly does not agree with every time she looks at her child or has a form to fill out.

"Absolutely. As women, we are taught from a young age that we have to be hypervigiliant at all times. 
"
"&gt; situations in which a busty woman wears a skin tight white sting tank top without a bra that barely covers her nipples and is strutting confidently downtown in public...

Problem is busty girls get that kind of attitude for wearing all manner of clothing. I’ve had people use language very similar to yours for wearing a target t-shirt. (Just an fyi, when you have a large surface area up top people often assume that your shirt “barely covers your nipples” regardless of where your nipples are actually located.) People will describe a professionally tailored shirt as “skin tight” because it fits in both the bust and the waist. It’s not skin tight, it just shows more curve because there is more curve. 

If a non busty girl were wearing that same tank top would you be commenting on her “strutting?” Would you feel compelled to hypothesize where her nipples are? You keep tabs on whether the A cup women around you are wearing bras? Are the only large breasted people who deserve to be treated as people, rather than a walking pair of boobs, uncomfortable children?"
"Hey, I'm sure his behavior was way out of line. But you still don't get it. Lies like this can destroy trust for good. He's just lashing out because he's hurt and cannot trust you. I'm sure he's *overdoing it* and going on a paranoid rampage. Those things are *wrong.* but you don't realize that the underlying issue of lack of trust is very reasonable. A better way to engage you would have been to calmly break up with you or calmly step away from the situation after expressing that he cannot trust you. He fucked up by getting emotional and directing those feelings aggressively toward you. But ultimately the underlying issue of the loss of trust is unrelated to his wrong approach, and something you seem to underplay.

Edit: it also seems like he might not have understood himself as well as he thought when he said you could rebuild the trust. He's still clearly too raw and you guys aren't really addressing the underlying issues. I think you should both recognize your faults here--but since I'm talking to you, OP, I think it starts with you. "
Right? All the people saying it's only temporary don't realize that this will forever change OPs girlfriend and their relationship.  
"As they say OP ""It's easier to dump a mama's boy than to divorce a mama's boy, and both of those are easier than trying to change a mama's boy."" "
"&gt; And I told her “Eh fuck it.” And she said “No, dude, that’s bad.”

I know you want nothing to do with him, and I know you want your best friend back. But do you know why she likely had that reaction and isn't talking to you? Because she's now paying the price for that little interaction. 

By no means is it your fault, I am not saying that in the slightest. But abusers will often increase the abuse on their victim when friend's ""step out of line"" in their eyes. So she's potentially taking the emotional/physical beating because of this event.

Time to start offering resources and get out plans. Nothing is too drastic at this point.  "
Maybe that's what to tell an actual BFF? For most friends/family I'd stick with u/Rooibos-tea's vaguer answers. They don't need to know the details of what's going on in OP and his fiancee's relationship.
"Worked retail for almost a decade. My store has 2 options. They'll take down the big things as it happens, like if someone is trying to walk out with over $200 in product. The smaller stuff they get vindictive about. They'll wait, watch, and record until they've totaled up enough merchandise for you to hit felony levels, then they arrest you. People think they've gotten away with it, then they're sitting in prison for several years."
"Just stating the obvious - he is not calling you at 3 am to see if you  are okay. He wants to have control over you, don't even answer these calls. Turn the sound off at night or block his number."
Wtf. Take your dog to the vet. You should be ashamed for not being a responsible pet owner. Think about giving your dog up to someone more responsible if she recovers from this
"&gt;I think about us being parents. He's always part of whatever thoughts I have in mind about this

This fantasy in your head is just that -- you're not picturing the real him. You're picturing an idealized version of him as a parent who wants that role as much as you do. The problem is, when you go down that rabbit hole **its inherently flawed**..

He is childfree. Have a discussion of him, but realize he may be unchanged on his position. Then you know the picture you want in your head is false. It's not him. If you only want kids within your current marriage, that's not going happen without his consent. Even if you fall pregnant unexpectedly that doesn't guarantee a happy outcome either, as a childfree man will want you to abort the pregnancy or consider divorcing you. 

So my point is, understand that you picturing him as a good and involved father **is you projecting how you wish he was**; not accepting actual his stance on his kids. Prepare yourself that your fantasy may never play out."
"Thank you so much, I needed to hear this. My mind is clawing at its self and all I can hear are my emotions taunting me to sympathise with him. Thank you, I see my therapist on Wednesday "
He's never been a small woman and probably never had a legitimate fear of being raped and murdered so he's having touble empathizing. I would forgive him for saying you're overreacting but I wouldn't forgive him for being mad at you about it.
"Its HIS issue. Seriously, there isn't anything that you can do. Some girls/women can dress shabby and still attract male attention. What is he going to ask you to do then?"
"&gt; Although separating my son from his parents and younger brother isn’t healthy either. 

I can't believe you are blaming her for this!!! God you're just as toxic as your husband. "
"&gt;  I'm just wondering if he will stick by his words that he has always said prior...i.e. ""go ahead and leave"".....""I'll help you pack"", etc.

Nope.  That is to say, he might at first because he won't believe you mean it:  remember, this is him calling your bluff.  Abusers don't like to lose their prey, so he will probably get extraordinarily angry and lash out.  So, my advice?

* Visit thehotline or loveisrespect and read up on putting together an escape plan.  Call either or both and get advice on how to do this:  when you leave, it will have to be suddenly and all at once.

* Legal consultation.  A divorce lawyer, for starters.  Your abuser may sue for custody of your underaged child, just to make your life difficult, so be prepared.  Have your financials sorted so he doesn't have access to your income.

* Set up new accounts at a new bank if you possibly can.  Freeze your credit.

* Gather your Team You.  You will need them for logistical as well as emotional support.

* Get your mail forwarded to a P.O. box nowhere near where you live or where you work so he can't easily track you down.

* Start therapy.  Surviving abuse is like surviving a war:  you need to deal with all the damage to your mind.

* Brace for stalking.  Once you are gone, you will have to tell work that your angry, abusive ex may come calling:  they need to know not to let him on the premises.

You sound like you've got this largely in hand, but remember:  **he mustn't know you're going until you are gone.**  Not to scare you, BUT TO SCARE YOU:  ***you will never be closer to death than on the day you leave.***

When you are gone, *stay gone.*  Be somewhere he doesn't know.  

But the domestic abuse hotlines (and your local women's shelters) will have TONS of advice for you."
He thinks he knows better than her what is good for her. That is patronizing.
"Oh, so she would have no problem telling a judge that? ""Sorry, your honor, I was divorcing and that's why I committed car theft. I simply couldn't help it."""
"Right? 

I would personally never date anyone like this in the first place, but I'd like to think that a 20-year-old could acknowledge their flaws and put in the hard work to fixing them so that they can mature into a functional adult. But it's been 5 years and he clearly hasn't done that. "

Calling the cops was the smart and safe thing to do."
Had to bang on my neighbors door because of a gas leak and she was fucking terrified. Single mom of three kids. I didn’t even think to maybe try and talk through the door because she said she was just standing on the other side for like 10 minutes shaking and not sure what to do. 
"Relapsing after 25 years, that is so frightening and horrible..."
Nobody would worry someone was trying to “trap” them if they didn’t want to escape.
"So the real question is what *do* you do then?? Are you supposed to make it known that you’re there and you hear them but you’re not answering and try to sound scary? Say you’ve called the cops I guess? Then if it turns out to be someone you know you’ll figure that out by yelling through the door? I mean all of that sounds fine but.. what a world, ya know?"
He's dating and having sex with a kid and he needs to not be doing that.  He's doing the right thing and apparently attempting to right the wrong of dating an 11/12 year old when he was 16/17.

"This is a tough one. Have you brought up the idea of giving his friends other roles in the wedding? Have him pick the best 3 or 4 (you'd have to expand your search a little more) to be the groomsmen and then have the remaining 5 or 6 have other roles. My cousin did this and had some men be ushers. They still were part of the wedding party sort of. Went to the bachelor party and were in a lot of the photos, but they just didn't stand up near the altar or sat at the table with the bride and groom."
"I would definitely advise asking random people to be in your bridal party. That rarely ever ends well.

Has your FH considered the ramifications of a giant wedding party? There's more plates to pay for at the rehearsal dinner, plus gifts, etc. 

We ran into a similar issue with my wedding because my FH hates the idea of imposing on people and would only have wanted a couple of groomsmen, while I couldn't get away with less than 8. So we decided to nix wedding parties entirely, and frankly it's been a relief to both of us. So much less to worry about, our friends don't have to spend tons of money on special outfits, and we still get to party and take pictures with them at the wedding. "
What happened was 6 years ago-we have all moved on except for her. I would like u to explain why you think this 
"There is a phenomenon called genetic sexual attraction that can occur when people who are related meet after not knowing each other for many years, supposedly. I get that you can't help it, so don't blame yourself for these feelings. They aren't your fault.

Your biological mother is choosing to abuse and exploit you. Your father was right to keep you away from such an evil woman. I urge you to cut off contact and seek therapy."
"Hum he sexually assaulted her while she was sleeping, and then tried to hide under the guise of ""a misunderstanding"". This isn't even really about if the dream was a happy or scary one."
"If you’ve been arguing more lately and are feeling neglected, are you sure you want to plan something together five months out?

I’d plan this trip with a friend. "
"It makes it real hard for them to be taken seriously by people who are looking for reasons not to take them seriously. The rest of us have no problem taking ""real"" sexual abuse victims seriously, even when you introduce gray area cases like this one."
at least youre honest 
"Did we read the same post??? Her asshole of a husband IS demanding a new child, while Refusing to parent his current one. What for? So he can neglect that one and put more burden on the mother? 

They agreed to have children within 2-4 years. It's been fucking 1 year, many women are still suffering after child birth for longer than that. And guess what, the woman is the one who takes the most damages from the birth, so they have 100% say in whether if or when they are willing to try for the next one. 

Anyone who can't bother to take care of one child does NOT deserve another one.

To OP, I also think you should show your husband this post and comments. If he has any sense of decency, love and respect for you, he needs to get his head out of his ass.

Edit: typo"
Ultimatums are fine when you’re dealing with addicts. 
Yes. But past traumas does not mean anyone has a right to harass or violate the privacy of others.
"Have you brought this up with your girlfriend yet? 

If not, calmly present your case and argument about why you think he behaves this way. Also ask questions - while it seems you've made up your mind already, more info is good. Is he always like this? How does he act when they're out with other friends? Etc.

If you're coming across as just jealous your concerns can be easier to dismiss, so make sure you're explaining why you feel the way you do about the guy and back it up. "
"Hey there. Am female. Do (did) this. It's a problem I'm working on managing.

For me, I get aggressive with sex when depressed and anxious because:
1. I feel so shitty and everything hurts so bad that I am desperate to make it stop as fast as possible
2. Almost nothing makes me feel good, and sex remains an exception. It is very distracting, and the more ""intense"" it is (slapping choking etc) the more distracting it is
3. Depression and self hatred make me feel worthless and like a burden, and sex is something I can point to that makes me 'useful"" as a partner - having sex with my partner makes me feel I am not a burden and they will not leave me

Encourage her to share these feelings with a therapist. I think what she needs is twofold: likely medication if her brain chemicals are this out of whalk, but maybe more importantly, *other coping mechanisms.* She, maybe with your help, needs to figure out other things that still feel good while she is depressed. If she's willing to talk this through with you while she's in a good headspace, you can come up with a list of things to try. For me, exercise is the most useful. If it is intense enough, it is very distracting from how bad I feel and usually produces endorphins at the end even if I am very depressed. Are you an active couple? If not, you could take up an activity together. /r/C25k is a great program for beginning runners and was the best thing I ever did when I was getting crushed by depression."
"He recieved a free vacation at a bed and breakfast  and free food for over a month because his card ""declined"". Sounds like you got played. "
I realize that and I definitely won’t from now on. It was just really hard to refuse my own mother that when she was always saying how much she needs them and how terrible she feels without them. 
"Sorry, didn't she say she is disgusted by you flirting with her because she can't imagine your body near hers? The way I see it, she admitted she wants to have sex with your boyfriend. Just friendly sex, I'm sure.

Of course, you should respect her boundaries - and she should respect yours. Asking her not to flirt with your boyfriend should have been enough. Your boyfriend should have shut her down himself as you made him aware how uncomfortable you are, and instead he's chastising you.

You are such a sweet person. I can see you're cutting her slack because she is struggling. Were you saying that you have actually agreed that he can hang out with her without you? But he refused because he just doesn't have time to hang out with someone he only sees every few months separately? Do you think that's the real reason? Don't you think it could be because your presence is the only thing that keeps it from being cheating? There is a word for hanging out with someone who is flirting with you, attracted to you, emotionally invested in you, and physically touching you: dating. It's not even that he won't stop her - he stops you from stopping her! Some people won't stand up for themselves but I've yet to meet someone who scolds their partner for trying to shut down unwanted sexual advances. That's consent. That's participating.

I see that you've said that you've decided to ask him not to hang out with her anymore. I agree. But, he shouldn't have treated you this way."
"What? That doesn't sound right. Are you dangerous to yourself or others? If not, it sounds like they are using fear to control you. 

P.S. At least a ""psych ward"" is run by medical professionals. Right now, you're locked in a house with your parents in charge. A psychiatric facility would be a huge step up actually! (Not to say that I think you would end up there, just that it's a stupid threat and not something you need to be afraid of, especially considering your current circumstances.)"
"Yeah, it doesn't seem like she is intentionally being a predator, but that is what is going on. I don't know of any secure teenagers who would date a 30 year old. Maybe she honestly believes they are in love and perfect for each other... but in reality he was probably very insecure and mirrored her personality while she molded him. Read her comments, now they are trying to have a baby together and she doesn't even want to consider the age difference... this is predatory. "
You. Need. To. Leave.
"It's absolutely a valid point! There's a huge percentage of them that will say stuff life: ""open your eyes sheeple"". They think they're privy to a truth no one else is, and that they're smarter or more open minded, less brainwashed than everyone else.

They feel bad for everyone else because they're not as enlightened as them. It's them thinking they're smarter than others and there's no dissuading them when they think you're a sad brainwashed idiot lol"
"So, your brother is rude, disruptive, and thinks he can do no wrong. He didn't become that way by accident. He became that way because that's how your parents brought him up. Your brother is the way he is, and behaves the way he does, because he was shaped by your parents attitude. Not the other way around. 

The only thing you can do is separate yourself from your family. If you live with them, move out. Until then, grey rock them.

""You should have stopped your brother!""

""Okay.""

""Your brother is a genius, the world just doesn't know it yet!"" 

""Okay.""

""You'll never amount to even half as good as your brother!""

""Okay.""

Keep living your life. Keep being awesome. But know that your parents are never going to wake up and realise how they've wronged you. In ten or twenty years, when you are successful in your life and your brother is still living at home, claiming that the world doesn't understand his genius, your parents will still be insisting it's your duty to help your brilliant brother. They won't ever go, ""Wow, you were right and we should have listened to you."" They will never say they're sorry.

So keep your head down and do what you need to do to get yourself to your best life. Then you will be free of them and their bullshit."
This is why I'm here. This is entertainment money can't buy.
You are throwing everything away for weed.  How is her choice any more unreasonable than yours? 
"People have made comments. Like wow you've never been this defensive. For Halloween (since I'm the youngest) in the office, told everyone to dress up since it's my favorite holiday.

He came in dressed for the first time in 22 years apparently. He said it's because he was thinking about what I said..

Honestly there's a of times where he said I was thinking of you over the weekend..blah blah"
Then why doesn’t he *just sign the papers that means he doesn’t have to pay*? It seems like you’re just trying to fight for an issue that doesn’t exist and looking like an idiot in the process.

"I can’t get past the part about sex being a nightmare, with a 50/50 chance whether you’ll scream in agony from the pain.

Your husband is evidently unfazed by his wife’s sudden screams of agony *about half the time you are having sex with him.*

That alone would make me not want to bring another child into the world with him...even aside from the havoc it has wreaked on your body and life."
"Yup.

Elsewhere? huge pet deposit and or pet rent.

First last and security.

The standard rules renters have to live by in terms of when rent is paid, overnight guests and how long they pay etc.

They expect you to treat them more like family than renters. Mixing family and business is always hit or miss and usually miss. 

I mean hell in no way shape or form should them paying rent have ever been up for debate

"Push the counseling again. Tell him that his earlier reaction is even MORE of a reason you need couples counseling - that when you say ""I want us to get help with X,"" and he hears ""You don't love me,"" that is a HUGE communication problem - that prior interaction WAS you trying to work it out, and for whatever reason, you two don't seem to be speaking the same language, and THAT'S why you need counseling - the counselor can act as a translator, and help you two work together. Right now your husband sees this as ""you vs him,"" and that's why he doesn't want counseling - he thinks it's going to be all about fixing him. You both need the counselor's help so it's ""you and him vs the problem,"" working together to resolve things."
"Why don't you ask your sister what she'd like you to do? Also I'd like to suggest you examine your own attitude to women - you won't stare at them when they're with other men? Why not? Respect for their ""ownership""? To be honest I'd be less creeped out being stared at when I have my brother/dad/bf with me than when I'm out by myself."
i just want to give you a giant hug. 
How the heck are you so nonchalant about your wife wanting to join a group whose whole basis of being is hating people because of the color of their skin. And that has a huge history of murder and other horrible crimes. Would you feel like this if she was getting into some other gang/cult like group?! Like wtf! You can be conservative without being a hateful racist and want to join the fucking KKK. And all you seem to be worried about is how this will look when it gets out? God I hope you’re either in shock and will come to your sense or that you’re a troll. I cannot fathom that this would be a decent human being reaction to this.i need to believe humanity is better than this. 
"You don't do fine in life, otherwise you wouldn't need it to ""chill"". I don't have a problem with weed, *but she does*, and the majority of people in the world don't need weed to relax. If you do, fine, but recognise that comes at a price, so if you can't persuade her otherwise, and you **knew** it was a problem for her, it's on you to either find another way to relax, or choose weed over her and own that decision. If you need it to relax, that's a symptom of an underlying issue (not necessarily a ""problem"" as such) and as such there'll be other solutions apart from weed. Don't let a reluctance to explore alternatives (therapy, mediation, lifestyle changes, other drugs she doesn't have a problem with) or general defensiveness explode your relationship. "
"Hmmm. So do they plan to amend their taxes to show this ""rental income"" or are they planning to cheat the government? "
"Yes, but it's different than presenting your kid with a bill for the 18 years or so you raised them."
"Lies lies lies. She might be hiding it from herself but there's an attraction. I usually try to take a middle ground but you're already nuts for staying with this girl let alone considering this a you issue.

It's so bad that even after reading the title three times I kept thinking you were just her friend. Don't let this girl manipulate you. "
SHE was MARRIED to HIM. Not you. 
"&gt; She's 20. She isn't studying in the medical field. ""Pre-med"" is literally every 18-22 year old. It's not a thing. 

You definitely spoke as if the American experience is the only one."
"2-5 may be an exaggeration, but buff mama is right, it's mostly for anti-doxxing, not because I'm trying to change the story. "
"I had pretty severe prenatal depression, that was ten times the depression I experienced before I was pregnant. It didn't necessarily include not wanting the baby, but I was pretty suicidal, extremely anxious and had obsessive thoughts. My meds were adjusted during my pregnancy and the depression eased up a ton. Prenatal depression isn't discussed enough. It's incredibly, frustratingly common! 

edited to add: during all my pregnancies, my first symptom has always been an increase in depression and anxiety, even before a positive pregnancy test. Hang in there, OP."
"Also, if/when he does insist that he was never interested and you're totally misreading him, you can follow up with ""Oh, that's a relief, I'm so glad we're on the same page! I was serious about the personal space, though."""
"I just read the first paragraph of OP's text and I had the exact same reaction.
If my bf even suggested that had to pay him for him being angry at me I would laugh. What thw actual fuck."
"&gt; and that I need to grow up and figure out what I'm doing with my life.

You're twenty fucking four. You were choosing between law school and dropping your life for some fucking flake, clearly leaning much more towards law school. Guy's just pissed a twenty four year old didn't chose to drop everything for him. 

I don't know if he loved you or not, I'm not him.  While I do this this dude is a dropkick no love is never meaningless. 

Your love was given, felt, and experienced. It's importance has nothing to do with whether or not it was reciprocated. It's still an important, meaningful experience for you.

"Maybe all these people saying this just have horrible water pressure? Because yeah, I've never *not* gotten drenched while washing my car. I just assume/accept it's gonna happen. "
"""Something like this"" being lying about your drug use and breaking a promise on something you knew was important to her."
"It seems like you are conflating two separate issues. Literally no one here is saying this was an illegal act, so the legality isn’t really a concern. But “social norms” and acceptable behavior are two separate things. You can dress in an unusual fashion and therefore not conform to social norms, but that’s not at all unacceptable behavior. 

My point is that the “evidence of power or control manipulation” is simply that a middle aged woman who had children older than the OP personally romantically pursued him. Maybe there are motives behind that that don’t involve hoping to manipulate someone but I can’t see what they would be. There are literally millions of adult men in the world, and she chose to pursue someone who had just finished high school. 

I also don’t think it’s unethical that he didn’t know her age before. That may have involved a small amount of deception on her part, but as you said he didn’t ask, so I don’t see anything wrong with that aspect. What’s wrong is that fact that she almost definitely knew HIS age, which is the problem here. 

I’m younger than this woman and don’t have children but the thought of dating an 18 year old feels creepy to me, because they are at a very very different stage of life than I am. In the best case scenario this woman is in denial about that fact (hard to believe since she has a kid around his age), and most likely she knows exactly what she is doing. "
"Jesus fucking Christ. I have never seen someone get so jerked around by another person and you by him. You know this guy will NEVER be faithful, right? You know that he has never been honest with you and is only telling you what he thinks you want to hear? 

Have some goddam self-respect and end this. Get a lawyer. Block all contact with him and have your lawyer be his only avenue of communication. Get child support. Go to therapy and work on moving on from him.

He doesn’t love you or his wife. The only person he loves is himself."

"Ok...  so, so many red flags.  

So you are supportive of this new business venture, despite the fact he is unlicensed, uninsured, un-skilled/not knowledgeable in the trade, and has entered into business agreements without written contracts to work on/in other people’s homes (i.e.  the largest investment most people own)?

Of all the risks he could be taking, driving without a license is the least of them!

One mistake in that unestablished business of his could ruin you both financially.  You will not be shielded from the consequences should his business fail or if his craftsmanship is shoddy and he’s sued.  If he is performing work without permits or violating other codes, those fines can be quite serious and have lasting repercussions.

Owning a small business is not something you do without at least some research and planning.  Protect yourself and your family’s stability."
"He sounds stubborn for the sake of being stubborn, is he like this with everything? How exhausting."
"Cut him out of your life, but do sue him for child support. Child support is for the kid's sake, not for you. You want your baby to have the best life possible. He will stress both of you out. You are stronger alone, it will be a much more stable upbringing without the drama and lies. "
"Seriously, if someone tried to spread rumors that my husband was sexually abusing children there would be no going back from that. "

"&gt;I single handed have now ruined my family

**No.** Her insane and abusive over-reaction  did. She is appalling and vengeful over a very small thing. This is 90% on her and 10% on you.

Now go get a lawyer to arrange child custody, and get the hell out of this relationship. "
I can't get over how he is 30 and can't cook or plan ahead for meals so he isn't going to restuarants after they close.
