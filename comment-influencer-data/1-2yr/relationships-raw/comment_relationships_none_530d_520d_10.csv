"Please try to stop blaming yourself. This perv you didn’t know STUCK HIS HAND DOWN YOUR PANTS and you defended yourself!! It is NOT your fault. And your husband sees his wife getting assaulted and did what probably a lot of men would do in that situation. 

Try your best to stay calm until you have a better idea of the situation and what kind of consequences, if any, your husband will face."
"I understand where you are coming from, but any children we have together aren't just going to magically appear inside of me without his input, so to speak. His child is always going to be his child, regardless of what surname it may have - with that logic, if we were to have a daughter and she were to get married and change her name, would he have no connection to her?"
"Pardon my ignorance as I have not used Tinder before. If you can see she has updated her profile on Tinder, does that mean you have Tinder on your phone still despite your wishes that she not have it on hers?"
"Why isn't she getting herself independent? She is 26. Is she in therapy? On meds? The more you do for her, the more you enable helplessness.

Not having a job means she is CONSTANTLY at home. It's about more than just money."
"Did you tell her you were planning to buy a ticket, so she could budget or plan, or did you buy the ticket first, THEN tell her? The latter is a bit inconsiderate imo. "
"Some people don't realize what their ""do not cross"" lines are until they encounter them.
"
"&gt; ""put my foot down""/""permission""  

Look at the ages "
have you asked her that? 
Best advice I've read in ages.
"&gt; how can i explain to him he has nothing to worry about 

don’t, you shouldn’t minimize/downplay the issue

to boost his confidence/trust - acknowledge that this is an issue, tell
him you are both on the same page"
"You said that you've talked about it, and that in his mind things will not get better, because they *can't*. So, considering that on his end there will be no effort to change anything, you have two choices: Suck it up and accept that your sex life will always be lackluster, and you will eventually move past boredom into resentment, which will bleed into all aspects of your relationship. Or, leave him and find someone who is sexually adventuresome and interested in novelty and exploration.

You can't solve this by yourself. However he seems to have his mind made up and has no desire to change."
"Their friends probably just call them asexual because theyre not interested in having a partner right now


Its not correct usage of the term, but it is something teens would say"
You think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies?
"You're 15, I get why you're embarrassed, everything is embarrassing at 15. But... I don't see any mention of anyone laughing at you in your story. In fact, you distinctly wrote that everyone helped you, everyone seemed concerned, and everyone agreed that they had felt the bridge was unsafe. It's not like you were doing something idiotic and caused the accident. There is truly nothing to be ashamed of and everyone just wants to make sure you're okay. If it wasn't you, it would have been someone else."
"The main thing that strikes me is that you're focusing a lot on Olivia's behaviour, and not a lot on Justin's. 

Yeah, it sounds like she's sometimes inappropriate with him. She should really knock that shit off. But you're not going out with her. Her behaviour isn't your problem.

And nothing you've said sounds like he behaves inappropriately towards her. Goofing off when she puts her sweater on him isn't inappropriate, it's just fooling around with a friend. Listening to her when he won't listen to anyone else is how a lot of guys are with close long-term friends, male or female. One-to-one conversations are what close friends do.

He's the one you're going out with. I'd give a lot more priority to his actions, and a lot less to hers.

He's agreed not to hang out with her alone, so it's not like she's going to get an opportunity to jump his bones. Beyond that, her behaviour isn't your problem unless you let it be."
"When some dude I've gone on one date with leaves something at my house, I'm throwing it away or putting it in the Goodwill bag after a week. If it was that important to you then you should have changed your schedule a bit to go get it back before winter break. Expecting her to keep track of your watch for that long is ridiculous. She didn't steal it and it's not her responsibility to go out of her way to get it back to you. "
"OP is just excusing their behavior as “that’s just the way they are” but it sounds less or that’s all he knows, I’m hoping he’s reading these responses and opening his eyes. "
^ This is a very insightful comment and I hope OP doesn't miss it. Context is key. This is not laughing-off territory for her.
"OP I live in Ontario, if you do, because of the free tuition for someone whose parents make under x amount, if you live on your own for a year i'm pretty sure you can qualify to have it covered the following year. Talk to your financial aid office at the university you're currently at or the college you applied to. I applied to as many bursaries as I could and was surprised at how much I got. I'm living on my own and paying tuition all by myself so if you need support feel free to pm me!

edit: I just remembered at my university a bunch of kids who live on residence leave a bunch of free or cheap furniture they don't want to lug back.... check your uni's fb groups and ask around."
"""Hey. I like you. Want to go on a date some time?""

And then be chill if he says no."
"It is NOT easy to get a job in Japan as a foreigner from any country, especially if you don’t know the language (unless you plan on teaching English). If I was just starting my career I wouldn’t move without a job either. "
Run!! I dated someone like your bf and it had a really negative effect on my career. Find someone whose goals are on par with yours
"You need to move out. This is a toxic environment for you. Your parents charging you rent is not going to protect you from your alcoholic father or him possibly using your car again. They're doing you a favor by living rent free, but you're doing yourself no favors by living in their house and being surrounded by your Dad and in this unhealthy home."
I can't imagine caring this much about how I look while working out at all.
Literally everything about your comment is gross and wrong. 
"Thank you for this. There's a huge part of me that knows it isn't okay and this other huge part of me that is SO suprised that this is happening, and so confused because of who he's been for most of our 7 year relationship, and how he is with other people, how much empathy he has for others and animals etc. I feel like somehow at some point I fell out of his empathy sphere or something, which also makes me think it must be me who is doing something wrong, you know?

But you're right, I'm allowed to say what hurts me and if he really cared he'd be sure to steer clear of doing things that hurt me! Thank you so much for your comment it's really helpful for me. "
"When you’ve been through what she’s been through, yellow flags default to red until proven otherwise. It seems like a huge overreaction for one lie, and I don’t think she realises it yet, but I get why she’s done it because she doesn’t want to end up in a bad situation again. She might not be as ready for a new relationship as she thinks she is. 

That said...she doesn’t think this is the first time you lied.

&gt;that I lie about stuff all the time bringing up examples where I am more of just avoiding the question, telling her a very short version of the story, or just answering the wrong question.

I think some examples here are necessary, because at the same time it’s possible you were way more out of line than you thought you were. "
"Stop letting the booze justify her horrible actions. There are tons of people that can get drunk and not cheat on their partners, so why exactly does she get a pass. I think you’re just afraid to end something so longformed, but you shouldn’t be. If all it takes is alcohol to get her to forget her commitment to you, then this won’t be the only time it happens. Just break things off and find someone who will value you sober or not. "
"So here's a framing: when she breaks something, regardless of physical injuries, she's feeling a psychological injury: the disappointment/fear/loss of having to deal with the fallout.

You have an opportunity when this happens: you can help her feel better about it, and show her you're on her team, and a pleasant person to have around. Or on the flip side, you can show her that you're punitive and critical, and that breaking something will ruin your whole day.

Story: when I first visited my now-MIL, I was up late with my husband in the evening, and spilled an entire mug onto the white carpet. I was of course embarrassed and upset, but the fact that he was completely relaxed about finding cleaning supplies and helping to clean up, stuck with me - ""here is someone who will make me feel better and help me solve problems."""
"Your wife is cruel. She's using sex as a way to manipulate you. Stand up for yourself, and push back. I bet she'll be really surprised and really apologetic real quick. "
"BREAK UP

You'll feel so much better about yourself if you don't stay with a cheater. There's no excuse for her behavior.

No amount of love will fix the fact that she doesn't respect you and honestly if you stay with her you probably don't respect yourself either.

Learning to love someone new (someone loyal) is not a difficult thing."
"I agree with this comment OP. If you want to do her a kindness, be the bad guy and take responsibility. I was broken up with ""nicely"" by someone I loved at the time who repeatedly told me how great and cute and worthy I was and it was a huge mental burden not knowing why I was STILL not enough for them. If the convo had been focused on him instead of me it could have helped me move on faster and given me a feeling of ""whew, I guess this breakup helped me dodge a big bullet, because we clearly were never on the same page"" instead of making me question myself for months. Good luck."
"I completely understand and have been in your situation, OP. While family is important, it can turn into an unhealthy/toxic environment especially when ""being guilted"" aka manipulated.

Saying no and setting boundaries doesn't make you a bad person. You have to think about your own needs as well and take care of yourself."
"&gt; I think he might leave if I became significantly disabled.

But you know, most people, IF they left, would try really hard first to make it work, because, you know they love their partner and they have empathy for their partner.  This guy sounds like he's seriously lacking in empathy and doesn't want to learn anything about it.  Like if you were left disabled he'd be out the door the next day. 

What's the point of being with someone like this?  You'd have just as much fun by yourself and you'd have an open space in your life for maybe someone who is actually capable of caring about you to move into."
"That's a difficult situation for both you and your mother. I'm sorry to hear about her losses. It seems obvious that the loss of those close to her had an affect on her well being. Often times, people pursue the supernatural as a way to explain or console dramatic changes in their life. She clearly sees some benefit in believing these things, but you're right to be concerned.

What's most concerning is that the things you're describing have a negative, somewhat paranoid vibe to them. I'm not a psychiatric professional, but as someone who has personally dealt with extended periods of isolation and low social contact, I can say that it definitely influences how you think and feel in profound ways.

I think finding a healthy way for her to socialize is probably your best bet. You can try to find a group on meetup.com that she might be interested in, and during the beginning you can go with her so she's willing to do it.  

I would also try and get advice from a trained mental health professional with regards to some of her more dark tangents of supernatural thinking. The losses in her life may have bubbled something to the surface that needs actual treatment. If you can somehow convince her to try therapy, that might be beneficial. 

I hope things get better for both of you. You're a great daughter for supporting her and caring about her. Keep that up. "
"Eh, I can see why you're irked. It kind of speaks badly of his character if he makes 300k a year but can't even think to be generous with the important people in his life.

No one HAS to share their wealth but no one has to respect people who only think of themselves either"
"&gt; He's a strong Libertarian

You should dump him just for that."
This. Just make a sad face and say ‘I don’t really talk about it. We respect each other but there were some issues we couldn’t address. I want to stop thinking about it and move on”
"&gt;  You can cheat on your spouse and lie about it for years if you want, it's not illegal. 

No  one in this sub says this. People come down hard on cheaters here. 

Also, a woman choosing her own clothes to please herself is not and never has been equal to someone cheating. Jesus. "
Oh wow. Me too. Pleased to hear it’s not just me being totally rude.
"You’ve made 7 posts on this thread alone. You seem *really* hung up on this idea of women “advertising” themselves for male attention, and incapable of understanding why a woman might dress herself for any reason beyond a desire to “catch” a man.

You’ve been exceedingly vocal about your own viewpoint, which is fine - but have you actually learned anything from what *actual women* have to say on the matter, or are you convinced that your own view is the only correct one?"
This side didn’t show up till I mentioned my ex
"Although I think it's super creepy what OP's husband is doing, I think saying that the daughter now has to protect herself from a predator is taking it a little far (and that comes from someone who has a history of sexual adult and has worked with rape victims for many years). And personally, when I was 19, I wouldn't want to know if the father of a friend or a family friend was lusting after me in private. It would make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

It's one thing to call the husband's actions creepy and inappropriate, but it's another thing entirely to start acting like he's a rapist and everyone he's lusted after has to be warned about his predatory ways. If the pictures he was saving weren't from social media and were instead ones he had secretly taken, that would also change the story. I don't see anything in the narrative that points to OP's husband as a *predator*, unless we've diluted the definition so significantly that now lusting after someone is predatory. "
Wow. Stand up for your fucking wife dude. Your family are assholes and she has every reason not to want to be near them. If you don’t grow a fucking spine soon you’re gunna be dealing with a divorce. I feel so bad for your wife. Most people would have kicked you to the curb a long time ago.
"You mentioned that he is having trouble maintaining an erection and sex is off the table.  How long has that been going on?  Are you two able to talk about that?  If this has been going on for a while, has he sought any sort of treatment for it? 

Yes, he clearly had a crush on the babysitter and isn’t reacting well.  But that seems like it might be a small piece of the bigger problem which is that your sex life as a couple isn’t in a good place.  Which is super common for couples with small kids.  Anyway, the most productive approach might be to work on improving your sex life together.  Like the saying goes: the grass grows where you water it. 

I know that sex issues can be difficult to work through.  But it just seems like if your sex life together isn’t in a good place, these crushes and insecurities will keep popping up, even if you both try diligently to squelch them.  "
Drunk driving should really be charged as attempted murder. Break up. She thinks her convenience is more important than other people's LIVES. I'm sure driving drunk isn't the only area of her life where this shows. 
Oh well I guess endangering people is ok if you only do it twice a year.  my bad!
"&gt;would only cause the rift between us to grow.

This rift has been there for what seems like your entire life. I think that your desperation in trying to connect and feel validated by your family has led you to accept a lot of abuse from them because at that point they're at least acknowledging you. But now you're asking your wife to do the same thing and now you've become an enabler to her being abused and disrespected by your family.

I think your wife's feelings and decision to create distance from them is valid and justified and she should not be persuaded to ""suck it up"" for you; Your real conflict is your family and you are rationalizing away your responsibility to her and yourself by standing up for yourself.

This situation will never change unless you change and demand the respect for yourself and your wife that you both deserve. "
"It changes the context of you comparing it to college girls, that's all.  It's one thing to say ""I couldn't even imagine"" b/c of their age, but when there's an attractive woman hanging around your house that's the same age as your wife, it's much easier for friendships to develop beyond just a professional level.

You ensured that you kept yours that way because you a good husband, which is clearly what he should have done.

I'm not saying it's appropriate to develop that kind of relationship with your nanny either way."
"You're ~~probably~~ right, thanks. 

edit: definitely right"
"It sounds a lot like she has always been a sugar baby, is actually YOUR sugar baby right now, and will continue to be one once you've cut her loose. Which you should do asap so that you have money again."
"Honestly dude, this sounds like a question a 16 year old would ask. Stop being so petty, immature and jealous. Those are extremely unattractive qualities to have and will not serve you well in healthy adult relationships.  You’re not her dad. Stop acting gross."
"&gt; A standing airplane is a horrible idea, and you shouldn’t bash other people for the way they choose to travel

Lol"
"&gt;Going into a new relationship with blind trust is retarded.

I agree that you shouldn't trust someone blindly. But trust is something that is built up slowly over time, not something you ""test"" someone on.  I don't think people appreciate it when someone fabricates a situation to ""test"" their morality.  "
"I’ve had a very odd relationship with my future MIL since the beginning. Mostly because I became pregnant early on in my relationship with her son, but unfortunately I always have to ask HIM to stick up for me. But as well as OP, they also don’t seem to care about me as a person and are also a well-off family. I went on a vacation to Disney with them and ended up spending over $200 more flying JetBlue than i would’ve flying with Spirit.. because they booked the flight. I’ve also vowed to never go on a vacation with them again due to them being overly controlling. Maybe the best course of action is to just pay the price &amp; maybe not vacation with them again unless you and your SO are in charge of booking. "
"Wow, that last paragraph killed me. Thank you."
"Contrary! 
Thank you for this comment. I recognize this behavior in other relationships I myself, have had but never knew the correct word for it! It’s nice to have a more refined word other than asshole. "
"Look through the content first though. You need to be careful when you're taking possession of someone else's porn, especially if they like them young."

"Exactly this, grow a spine and protect your wife (and yourself) OP."
"I think I’d lose pretty much all respect for any partner of mine who behaved like this. 

You can’t change your wife if she doesn’t want to be changed. But if you have the patience to try, set up a time for you yourself to attend a meeting or workshop for family members of LGBTQ people, and ask her to come with you. Make it a regular thing. Talk to other parents who have struggled with their children’s sexuality, and bring her into the conversation. Let her hear stories of the permanent damage her current behavior can do to the relationship with her child. Let her ask questions and share feelings with people who have also had difficulty accepting their child’s sexuality. 

Hopefully, for your stepson’s sake, she’ll come around. As far as your marriage is concerned...that’s your call to make. This is a pretty big fly in the soup and only you can decide whether or not it’s worth powering through."
"How do you do couple's therapy with someone like this though? I wouldn't be able to trust that anything I said would be confidential, and if you can't speak your mind, how can therapy work?"
"Your boyfriend prioritised some misplaced sense of ""being a man"" or ""protecting you"" with actually doing what you asked, and respecting your decision about how you wanted things to go. Oh, and lied about it. He doesn't have to deal with the potential consequences of his actions - you do. Sadly there's not much you can do now except see what happens, but you're within your rights to tear your BF a new one and make it clear that he doesn't have the right to overrule *your* decision about *your* living circumstances just because he wanted to act tough."
"I don't know if you use dating apps, but just putting a blunt disclaimer of 'I'm looking for something serious' right at the top of your profile helps. You'll still get the idiots who don't even read a profile before messaging and asking for sex, but it should help sort out a number of them. "
"Taco Bell our lord and savior doesn't have apples if I'm remembering correctly. 

**BUT** what if one of the employees handling her food ate an apple for lunch? Then the apple midiclorians could get into her burrito and poison her. 

I joke, but life for people with severe peanut allergies is *hell*, and they have to be hyperaware about things like that (did the person handling my food eat peanuts or touch them? Did the knife used to cut my food also touch peanut oil? etc) so to see this chick ""allergic"" to apples just seems off. "

"The US, especially some parts of it, is actually still a deeply conservative country. Moreso than some parts of Europe to be sure when it comes to things like

He is probably married.. 
"I was a manager, then a director for a  all center for an insurance company.  Obviously with FMLA, I couldn't fire an employee, but having seen many people abuse the periodic FMLA leave, especially in an environment where dependability is key, such as in a call  center, I can pretty much guarantee his chances to move up in the organization are nil and will remain so until he sucks it up and  starts exceeding the requirements for the job.  
Trust me - call center managers have seen it all in terms of work avoidance by employees  and we know when someone is legit, or playing the system "
Sounds like you’re a free meal ticket and some comfort when she’s done partying. Based on what you’ve said I have no doubts that she has cheated on you. Call it off man this woman has zero respect for you.
"I barely had to read through half of this to realize that you're the problem, OP. Stick up for your spouse and really sit down and think about all the crap she's had to endure from your family and you're doing jack shit to protect her from it. "
"Honestly, I would suspect that the fact that OP's drop in sexual interest in her boyfriend + his insecurities about her past + her ""suddenly"" (in his mind) having to work overtime constantly with the same guy is adding up in his mind.

It's definitely a together problem. He needs to work on his insecurities, but it sounds like OP needs to have some balance too."
"I like this advice. She and I have already been to a few jewelry stores so that she could point to things she does and does not like, so we're on that path already."
"Your wife is now your immediate family.  That means she should be your number one priority.

Your *extended* family are assholes and you are spineless.  

Why are you trying to keep the peace with assholes rather than defending your wife?

Go check out /r/justnomil to see the many, many posts from your wife's point of view.  

ETA: ^^^ I know it I probably sound really harsh - but look at all the other posts in this thread with essentially similar views as mine.  I don't think I saw a single post saying your wife was wrong.  This tells me your 'normal' meter is broken"
"Right?! My mouth literally dropped when I read that he wasn’t even *hiding* the fact that he missed her! Couldn’t believe it. If that were my husband, I’d seriously be questioning why an employee had such a hold on him the way OP’s husband has on this babysitter. Obviously there’s something more going on. I was a nanny for a long time and I NEVER once touched my employer’s body. And I was like family to them. "
My husband and I have been married for a few presidential elections and he hasn’t posted anything about his personal life at all since we were dating. Some people just aren’t into social media.
Yeah cause an accidental pregnancy sounds like a good plan for them right now. 
"I failed out of college because of mental illness. Three times, even. I have some self esteem issues there and sometimes I'll make fun of myself for being a dropout, but my husband has never, ever belittled me for it. I can't imagine how it would feel to have my partner look down on my like that for doing the best I possibly can and trying to be happy and healthy.

And there's nothing wrong with being happy with the job and education you have, even if it isn't glamorous or high level. If you have a job you like doing, that gets the bills paid, you're already doing better than a lot of people. "
"Unfortunately, she's always that way when she gets angry. She'll fly off the handle and say just about anything that she knows will push your buttons."
"you bailed at the first sign of trouble. and you made it clear you were bailing, give me the ring back. you're not ready to be married, in a way it's good for the both of you. i think she'll be better off tho."
Our one year will be next month so no time for that and I like the idea of having 4 years to plan it. 
That’s completely dependent on the chain of command...
Does he make money by betting on sporting events?
I don't know who wouldn't be emotionally destroyed by being abandoned this way. 
"My wife had 4 miscarriages in a 3 year time period before our daughter came along 2 months ago.  We mourned differently, but honestly I think what helped us was that we did not have this vastly different conceptualization of our grief.  We never named any of them.  We treated them in a similar way as you.  There was a reason they weren't viable, and with both of us working in social services, we understand the heartache, pain, and work when one that maybe shouldn't be viable becomes viable.  We never wanted that for our child.  I totally get where you are coming from.  Don't let anybody tell you differently.

His way of coping *was* fine, too.  Names and angel babies and whatnot is a perfectly fine way to deal with miscarriage.  I stress the was because it's been 3 years.  Those reminders may come around, but I don't think it's healthy for him to fixate the way he is, and it sounds like this fixation is bringing you down to a place where you are just wanting to heal.  

He needs to process this, and he needs to understand that you have processed it differently, and that is okay.  At the same time, he needs to see that you have moved on and you don't need constant reminders of the things you have mourned and left behind.  He should respect that.  He probably shouldn't get a tattoo as there is no more permanent reminder you can get.

At this point, he needs therapy, and he needs to quit discussing it with you.  Other people may say you need to meet him halfway or whatever, but it sounds to me like you've tried, and you understand where he's coming from, but that pain does not to be yours.  You have to make it clear if you haven't already that you can't live constantly being reminded of this.  You just can't.  

Good luck to you both."
"Can I have her?  *You just need to lay a trail of 75% off coupons to a crate propped up by a stick, then pull the string.  Just make sure to leave air holes for the trip across the Atlantic*

I was her, in any number of arguments with my ex-wife. (don't even get me started on how every member of her family buys brand new cars)   And my son still gets a little mulish when he wants some new shoes and I tell him I'll look for a sale/coupon.

Seriously though, it can become kind of addictive.  When you are buying 14 years worth of toothpaste because you found a sale for $.17/tube, you are taking it too far.  You may have to come to a compromise on it."
"This. ""Pretty little schoolgirl,"" holy shit! "
Tell him to knock off the lying and games and be real with you. He only made things worse for himself here. If anything it honestly gives me reason to believe he actually likes her.
"I think you did the right thing. As rare as it is, sometimes these worst case scenarios DO happen, and you wouldn't want to be the person going ""I had an instinct something was wrong and didn't follow it"". 

You were honest and set a reasonable boundary with her and she reacted badly. She's entitled to have an opinion about that, and entitled to make bad relationship decisions if she wants (unfortunately no matter how toxic it is). 

However, SHE refused to answer texts or calls without letting you know she was going on holiday. If she'd said ""I don't want to talk to you, I'll be out of contact for a week"" that would have been something at least. But with no reason to suddenly ghost that hard, no hint of return and a sudden change in text patterns? I'd be worried too."

"Oh so now it's your duty to put up with his abusive, racist, horrible parents? "
"Your friend asked a dumb question and if she didn't want to know the answer, she shouldn't have asked the question in the first place. Don't apologize because IMO, you did nothing wrong. Just give your ""friends"" some space and hopefully they'll turn their gossip to something else sooner rather than later. In the meantime, just focus on spending time with the friends you didn't piss off because they seem to be relatively reasonable."
He could definitely get an entry level position if he still knows his stuff and can prove it in an interview
"&gt; He's not getting a job as an EE without going back to school. 

Perhaps he could, but not at the six-digit wages he had originally been offered, and he won't be able to for the better part of a decade. "
"OP, this. They’re closer to each other. See if your husband could ask him “hey bro, just curious, why weren’t wife and I invited to these events but we’re invited to the reception?” 

It’s probably better if your husband said this in person rather than over the phone, less chance for the guy to run to his wife and say help. This way he’s confronted head on and need to reply then and there."
That's what really worries me. How long have Op and her been friends? How long has him been planning this? It's disgusting to imagine. 
Right?? 3-year-olds definitely know how refer to and distinguish between their own parents and other kids' parents
"Serious, non-rhetorical question: why on earth are you putting up with this? Your boyfriend should have cut off this “friendship” a long time ago. Friends don’t exclude their friends’ SOs out of jealousy."
Yeah I think I did overreact out of anger. But it also really upsets me that this girl always asks him to hang out and smoke together (my bf often invites people to his house to smoke weed but stoped doing that since we’ve been together) and also texts him to study together even thought they both haven’t been to that shared class in 2 months. I guess I’m just upset that it’s hurt and I’m sure he will have an excuse. 
Say “yo! This is an A and B conversation C yourself out of it understand?” Next time no tip for you!
"I'm so sorry you're going through this.  There is a silver lining to this, though.  You now have the opportunity to find someone who won't spy on you, will respect you and your boundaries, and also respects themselves.  Stay strong, sister!"
"You’ve spent something like at LEAST $60,000 to support someone who you could not even communicate with while you were physically together. You couldn’t have one honest conversation about where you are at in life, your cultural differences... I mean it’s completely obvious that she is using you for money, but why in the world did you continue this when you could not even talk to her in person? She’s from a more conservative country with more separation of men and women. Do you understand attitudes towards gender and sex in Sri Lanka? Are you familiar with her culture beyond tourism? If you want to go enjoy the kind of relationships you expect to be in as a mid-30s man in America, you would have plenty of potential obstacles if this were just a long distance relationship. 


You have spent the equivalent of an entire college degree, a possible house down payment, or two good cars. I want to joke like the other commenters about how you could send that money my way but this is just... not a funny situation. With $60k you could have started a small non profit serving your community. Produced plays. Gotten a masters degree. Traveled the world for a year. Helped people rebuild after floods and fires. Eaten every single meal at a nice restaurant for YEARS. Whether you would do good for the world, improve your own life, or just live it up with that money, you can’t. It’s gone. But if you’re so well off you’re not hurting to lose this much money a month, well, maybe that’s why you continued on for five long years.

You need to stop sending her money immediately and prepare yourself for how immediately her attitude will change towards you. This was never a relationship and you were never actually close to her. Sorry that you needed this wake up call. "
"Your girlfriend is crazy and abusive and you cannot fix her. If you ever have the guts to decide you don't want to spend the rest of your life enslaved by her issues, you will feel so much better once you're free. "
It’s not just a male flight or fight thing. Several guys who have thought it was funny to scare me regretted it especially when my reaction inflicted pain to the genital region! I was grabbed from behind and swung my fist backwards and caught him in a very delicate area. 
"You say she calmed you down not that you forgave her or trust her. I think maybe neither are true due to you even reading the chat logs?

You also misspeak and call the affair a divorce, ""my wife has been great to me since the divorce ""

So divorce is the answer and you know it. You're looking for some argumentive reinforcements so when she starts spinning her web again you can give her a WWE verbal truth smackdown. 

Wise choice, keep copies of all the evidence.

Don't feel bad for snooping if she had been honest you could have left her then instead of snoop at all. She stole a whole 2 years just trying to placate your consistent doubts that she instilled."
"Why doesn't he talk to his boss about leaving the work van at his work over night when he wants to stay with you? If it's ""right across the street"" can't he walk over to your place? Then you still have your vehicle if you want to go to supper someplace or can use a taxi/rideshare and his work van is at work."
"She is the luckiest prostitute in the world, dude. She gets paid 1000 a month from some shmuck who has never even seen her in a bra."
"Not only that, but he himself admitted he wouldn’t be fully honest with you if he’d done something more. Take him at his word and deduce that he went further and is simply hiding it from you, imo. "
It is hard to hold in the secret that I know.
The way you rate her amongst other women you “can be with” and talked about women’s appearance in your original post is extremely disrespectful. It wouldn’t surprise me if you made your girlfriend insecure with comments in this context. You don’t respect your girlfriend and it doesn’t sound like you respect women much outside of their appearance. 
Yes. Christ all mighty. Park the work vehicle at work and drive it from there. 
"I love the being drunk is no excuse... I get as an adult it would be unacceptable but when I was 20 I didnt really know how much alchol was too much. Throw in the fact in some social groups it was bragging rights to have your stomach pumped, I think that the situation does need to be talked about but it isnt breakup worthy."
"OP, ignore these people. You did nothing wrong here. You were worried about your friend in a sketchy relationship. I'd have been doing the same thing."
"&gt; I really don't want to rush things when it comes to moving in and marriage

&gt;I don't see how some ceremony and peice of paper makes our relationship better.

I think this is why people say you're stringing her along.  It's absolutely not rushing into anything after 6 years in a relationship; if you don't know for sure after 6 years, then it's just not meant to be.  You're in the extreme minority that thinks 6 years isn't long.  Also, if you know you don't want to get married and you know she really does, then you should end it.  Neither of you are going to suddenly change your mind.  She wants marriage and you don't, so you should end it so you can both find people that share your values."
Charge your friend with sexual assault or rape or whatever applies here and then maybe your girlfriend will believe you when you say it wasn't consensual.
Three: OP is uncomfortable bringing it up to his husband
She has a history of domestic violence. I would never feel comfortable with this. 
"&gt; Sounded like a bunch of bs.

You're a smart woman. 

&gt; How do I not become bitter?

I had a friend who was in a similar situation. No matter what was said to her, she can't shake her bitterness because ultimately your own personal experience will shape your thoughts much more so than words from someone else. Ultimately, she resolved her situation by just taking the plunge and going on more dates. While it took her a while to find her now-husband, going on a lot of dates with great people helped her reevaluate her outlook. 

&gt; Should I reach out to his wife and tell her what happen?

I would 100% reach out to the wife. Put yourself in the wife's shoes, what would you want to happen?"
"He should get a job, at least part time, and work on his projects in his spare time. What's so difficult about that?"
Don't go back to that house. 
"Dude. You can have whatever preference you want, it has no affect on me. OP wants to *get past this feelings* so I'm trying to help out, he didn't ask to have them reinforced. Trying to say I have such a hard stance on, you know, accepting people and not being judgmental, says more about you. 

This is an unproductive conversation that I am tapping out of."
"OP's friend took it further than believing her husband though. She believed her husband instead of OP, denounced OP's claims, and tried to ruin OPs friendships. Her friend should've taken both sides of the story into consideration instead of immediately siding with her husband. Clearly jumping to the conclusion didn't help. "
"If they're both willing to work toward it, sure. In this case, she's clearly not interested in respecting you and you deserve to be respected."
"But what help does your husband give in raising him now? Because all it sounds like is he's only working against you and making things worse for your brother. He's been openly resentful of your brother since he was a kid, and he's made sure your brother feels unwelcome with you to the point your brother felt he had to leave, and you're still with him. Of course your brother is angry at you and difficult to handle right now. You've done so much for him, but right now it's hard for him to see that because you're tolerating his abuser. "
Don’t marry her. This will never stop.
"He *thought* it was silly, but he *said* he was sorry that it happened. Maybe he didn't hide it well enough, and she knew he thought she was being silly?"
"I think your gf is having a severe case of compare-and-despair, and to top it off, she has no idea how to emotionally handle it. 

I bet your ex is beautiful. Or hot, or both. She's obviously successful and she obviously has great people skills. Throw in her looks and your fiancée is feeling less-than. 

You can reassure your fiancée that she is the only woman to you, the most beautiful woman in the world to you, and that you want to have a life *with her*. But you also need to address the fact that her reaction is completely on her, it's completely uncalled for, inappropriate, immature, and exhausting to deal with. 

Maybe she should see a counselor for self-esteem issues.

Dial it back. There's no need for this. 
"So your boyfriend knows what you actually wanted (which is not a FitBit), doesn’t get it but hypes it up endlessly, and then shows you what you can do with it even before your actual birthday, and then gets upset when you want to exchange it for another style (not another thing!), and then denies you cuddles in the evening.

He makes YOUR birthday about HIMSELF."
When it's his own fucking niece.
"The best predictor of the future is the past. Esp for people. She chose herself over you every time she hit a crossroads. If you stress her life or her marriage, or her kids - I guarantee you she will pack your bags. You are a release from guilt for her, little else. Love is not an emotion, when a parent - it is the act of putting a child's needs above your own. 

Your dad sounds awesome. Keep him close. "
"This is a slightly ridiculous suggestion, but right now the problem is that he's not attracted to you when you're not perfectly groomed. What if, instead of you spending time every day to get completely smooth, he spends that same time to do some work on how he views the female body. Because right now he frames it as a you-problem when it can just as easily be seen as a him-problem. "
"&gt; And because no one my age wanted to go on a date with me.

18 years olds do put up with a lot of nonsense because they don't know better, that's true."
Chances are she IS using you.  I’m guessing you’re probably using her for certain things too?! 
Like I said - if her family is weird and she has never been around kids she may not know how. A little guidance goes a long way. 
"I don't think it's something to be too concerned about. Like another comment said, could have just been a pop-up. 

If you want to talk about it, just be like, ""hey this is awkward.. but I was on your computer and sex-and-flirt.com auto-filled in the search bar. I don't care that you watch porn, but this just made me feel weird. Can you tell me more about it?""

"
"I have several concerns:

- He’s clearly bad with money

- It sounds like he’s pretty clingy

- He’s probably a liar and super lazy

- He’s never getting promoted at this job and is taking no pains to look for a new job at a different company

You need to talk to him about this directly. “Hey, you seem to only not feel well when I’m off of work. Why is that?” and “I’m really worried about our financial situation. If you can’t do this job because of your headaches, is it time for you to look for a different job?” If this relationship is going to work, you need to be able to talk about things, and it sounds like you two haven’t really discussed this at all.

I would also sit down and do the math. Yes, another job might pay less, but with all the unpaid time he’s taking, it might be a wash. And if he likes it more and it doesn’t aggravate his headaches, that would be a huge win. "
"You're not ""dating two people."" You're cheating on your long-term girlfriend. Hilarious that you say she's ""half assing"" working on your relationship and you're literally screwing someone else. Wow."
"Oh that’s too bad, maybe you’ll meet people when you move into student housing?  I totally get telling someone but it would be better friends and no parents.

So, were you parents ok with okcupid?  I would just play along and tell them you are going on okcupid dates if it makes you feel safer."
"You really, really don’t know him. At all. 

And based off this incident, I think you need to accept that this guy is not only a bad relationship investment, he’s an active threat to your own nascent sobriety. You are in no way equipped to care for a relapsing addict while also managing your own recovery. This is a *terrible* idea. 

Find a stable roommate and move out. If you absolutely insist on wasting more time in this relationship, you can just as easily date him from your own separate place. Take a *giant* step back and let him figure his own shit out. You need to worry about yourself. 

"
And giving away his sick daughter's groceries she needs for her recovery.  That'd be divorce grounds by itself
"My ex was helping me move at night from my place into his. Hid in my closet with a black hoodie with a evil look on his face and I screamed so long and loud from terror, the neighbors showed up bc they thought I was hurt. 

For the next two years, he would continue to hide in closets, behind doors, we had a large apartment with two entrances and I never knew if he was in the apartment ever. 

Sometimes he would just stand in doorways and stare at me from the top of his eyes with his head bent down and ask if I was scared. And then shame me for being scared of my own boyfriend. 

He said it was a joke and that I'm too sensitive for jokes and that he's not gonna change who he is because I'm too sensitive for jokes. 

This is abuse. Get out. I had to wait for him to be out of the house in order for me to leave him for good. Other shit happened too to get me to leave him like this. But the scaring was the first part of the abuse I endured. "
"A gentle and caring person wouldn’t cheat. It’s not your fault, it’s his. This isn’t working out. Leave."
"Not deleting and/or blocking his ex after receiving said message? Yes that is being in contact. Keeping a pornagraphic video of an ex? Especially if it was recieved after the breakup and while in an exclusive relationship with someone else? Yes that is absolutely worth getting dumped over. 

You seem very angry and to be taking this personally. I hope you have a lovely day :)"
"I feel like this is a cycle a lot of people get into but for some reason men especially. But it sounds like you wanna acknowledge your own toxic behavior and adjust it and my 100% recommendation for the time being is 1. Find a therapist and start writing down these arguments with your girlfriend and bring them in to talk with a therapist about where you’re thinking might be going wrong and 2. Stop bringing up these hurt feelings with your girlfriend UNTIL you talk them out with your therapist and decide with them.. is this feeling valid or is this me overreacting?? 

Because I guarantee it’s very suffocating for her to be analyzed constantly and that’s why she can’t be herself. You don’t wanna be the person others walk on egg shells around cuz you’re getting mad at completely normal behavior. It sucks to say keep your feelings to yourself but really until you KNOW what your feeling is reasonable that’s the best thing to do. And a therapist is great for working that out with you. 

You sound genuinely receptive to change and I just wanna say as hard as it is to look inward and acknowledge your own toxic behavior, it’s torally possible to grow and learn from this experience and allow it make you a better, healthier person and a good partner. It’s hard to reroute your thoughts especially when it comes to insecurity and jealousy but people grow and change all the time and I really hope you can do so! You’re young, at some point we’re always a worst version of ourselves so try to let this acknowledgement be motivation to move forward vs more shame/insecurity! "
"so.. allow me to indulge my paranoia? i didn't notice anyone else mentioning this kind of thing.

"How dare your mum call you ”stingy” after all the money you have given to your brother?

Writte down all the money you’ve lent, all your possessions that has been sold to give the profit to your brother, and anything else of yours that has been given or taken to give to your brother. Then write down what your brither has given to you (birthday and christmas gifts not included). Subtract it and see how much your brother has earned of of you. Then whenever yoyr mum dares call you ”stingy” you give her that number.

Don’t be afraid that it will be confrontational or accusiary, because to be able tonstand up for yourself you need to be prepared for your parents dissaproving of you doing so and do it anyway. Get mad! Confront your parents about you paying for your unemployed brother! Accuse them of prioritising their sons comfort ocer their cancer-sick daughters health!

And if they dare bring up that they were supportive if you after your diagnosis then shout at them ”That’s what parents are supposed to do! You don’t get extra credit for supporting a sick child! Especially since you’ve done it ten times as much for brother without telling him he needs to also be generous with me.”

Your mum is manipulative, and you can’t see her behaviour as the norm for how people behave nor see her words as an accurate representation of reality. You need to start question her behaviour and persoective, and learn to trust yiyr own feelings and instincts."
"Discussing engagement and marriage before proposing isn’t at all immature, nor is discussing the ring, but this guy is full of BS. "
Thats something a teacher who has lost total control and is being laughed at by students would say. This kid would get bullied like fuck if he said any of that shit lol
"If you’ve done the following:

1) apologized and fully taken responsibility

2) demonstrated that you’ve changed your behavior AND how you’ll keep your commitments in the future

3) communicated the limits and boundaries you’re willing to have with these women

4) asked her what would make her feel comfortable

Then I think you’ve done all you can. Some women are not comfortable dating men with these kinds of friendships, and you might not be compatible."
"He's telling you this so that when he cheats on you, you will automatically assume you're to blame."
"It’s a really, really tough situation when people you love make you choose! I am so sorry, sweetheart!

My suggestion is a hard, yet obvious since you already seem to know this answer.
You’re your own person. You’re not a sheep. You should be confident enough to make your own thoughts, seek out your own view on morality, and live your life. Not your parent’s life.

Does your boyfriend treat you well?
Does he put you first, and love you the way you deserve to be loved?

You said he does. So sit down, have a serious talk with your parents, even though it’ll be hard for them to hear. Don’t choose their path over your own. It will lead to resentment, and you don’t want to submissively follow a plan without question. 

Forcing you to choose a particular way of life, is not an action of love. Always choose love. If your parents cannot come to terms with your choices- then tell them the door is always open for them, but you’re doing what you feel is right.

I understand how you feel to an extent. My whole family is Christian and my boyfriend is not. He’s a wonderful man, and he’s my best friend. But my dad is particularly worried and upset that we want to get married, even though he thinks he’s a good guy.

No matter how you approach this, it unfortunately will not be easy.

But you’ll get through it, and be off happily married with your partner. You’re a team :)"
"Controversial opinion. While legally 18 is adulthood, an 18-22 year old dependent on parents isn’t *actually* a mature adult and it is legitimate to interfere in their lives since they’re a bit ‘late’ developmentally.

 I personally didnt feel like an adult until i turned 25, definetly not at 18 and I think many people can admit that. OPs sister is being a bit childish but is possibly being manipulated by this man."

"I mean she's using her friends as an excuse as to why she took hard drugs. Peer pressure isn't really an excuse as an adult; either she has the self-control to say no, or she doesn't. If she's saying that being around these people made her try drugs, not being around them anymore should, in my opinion, be a condition of you staying with her."
"You need to end this relationship yesterday. I am 99% certain your boyfriend does not have a sleepwalking issue. Look up sleepwalking and you will see how ridiculous his behavior while 'sleepwalking' is. He's making it up to screw with you. He intentionally scares you in order to upset you because it gives him amusement. The fake sleepwalking is yet another way to amuse himself at your expense. He is an immature, mean, and stupid person. Ditch him."
"well she knows that engineering is a typical 9-5 desk job, and secretary is also a 9-5 desk job. Plus secretaries are mostly female and I am female, so therefore me studying engineering is like me studying to become a secretary?




I think that's her thought process"
"Not sure why you are so determined to make this all her fault. The point is, your fiance says something that could provide an opening for you to make a joke about something they are very insecure about. If you love them and aren't a huge asshole, you won't make that joke. You'll let it go. And if, in his drunken state, he spoke without thinking?

HE SHOULD HAVE ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED THE NEXT DAY. "
"Why on earth would you want to be with someone who fetishizes your insecurities. This doesn't make any sense to me. That will not lead you to a healthy relationship (unless you get off on being bullied/demeaned, but it doesn't seem like you have that fetish). 

There are plenty of chubby chasers around who don't treat their partners this way. "
"Your mother is so far out of line I'm not sure she's in our galaxy any more. Your wife is having a COMPLETELY NORMAL reaction to having to deal with your mother without support from you. This isn't a ""conflict"" as in two sides. This is your mother behaving atrociously to the mother of your child.

Grow a spine and stand by your wife. Set FIRM, CLEAR boundaries with your mother. WHEN she crosses them (not if), back it up with consequences such as limiting contact.

You're acting like you're married to your mommy. If you keep this up, that's the ONLY marriage you're going to have."
"I agree with you. I just wanted to add my mom's abusive ex liked to torment her, emotionally drive and incite her to push him or even slap him, then hold that over her for days. It worked great because most outsiders gave him the sympathy and couldn't see his abuse at all. So he got away with it for years. It even took me, her grown up child, 2 years to see the truth of that guy. Just saying that this post sounds similar, and so I do suspect he is an abuser, based on my own experience."
[deleted]
"I think you'd find a lot more support if you'd had this name from the beginning. I'm married and I kept my maiden name, so I'm definitely not one to judge on that. 

The problem is you already took your husband's name and now four years later you want to change it. That's a whole new and much more complicated issue. 

But as I and others have said... if neither of you are willing to compromise, then what is there to say? "
"You should be angry to any person who calls their SO ""baby"" because their SOs aren't babies either."
"There are quite a few current research articles, some published in Nature, that support that having children past 35 has a correlation with higher rates of genetic abnormalities.  In both the age of the females eggs and the males sperm. I don't know if I am allowed to link articles, but most good articles are behind paywalls.  (Another topic) I do suggest Google *scholar research, and not straightforward google. I definitely would not give, The Atlantic, credence. 

I am not disagreeing with you about being able to have children late in life, but I am saying that there IS evidence of an increased risk. Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should.  


Not to mention it is much harder for older women to ""bounce back"" and recover from birth. This is part is anecdotal because I had my first at 32. I do not plan on having another child as it was difficult to recover from and by all accounts I had a easy pregnancy and moderate vaginal birth. "
"Mark sounds great, but he's wrong. There are more good people in this world than you will ever possibly be able to get to know. You don't have to put up with shitty people just because they happened to cross your orbit and stick for a while. You could take the time you spend with her, use it to get to know five good people among your acquaintances, and before long you'll have a new best friend."
"Hi OP, it seems that most people in your comments are on one side or the other. Let me offer a middle ground that you may consider. Long story short, you're well within your rights to not enjoy the attention, but don't be angry at the guy because he's behaving fairly normally. Neither one of you is 'wrong,' but you have wildly different expectations of the relationship. You might just have to break it off by saying you're not suited to each other.

What this guy's doing seems quite normal from the outside. You've been seeing him a while and flowers outside a door doesn't mean anything sinister unless you know it does. If he's been respecting your boundaries up until now I think it's fine. Unless you specifically said 'never come to my house unannounced because it freaks me out,' he probably did it in good faith. He didn't demand to see you which is good. But if he really said ""I'll fuck off"" that seems immature and paints a different picture.

How often do you see him? You seem to feel suffocated by him asking to see you all the time but if you never see each other, he's behaving pretty normally. How many times does he text you?

With the info you've given, it's more that you both have different but both acceptable expectations for dating. Have a talk with him without getting angry and acknowledge it's because you're finding it hard to trust at the moment. If he gets angry and demands you accept his affections then break it off, but equally he is allowed to say ""Sorry that's not what I want in a relationship, this isn't working.""

You may be able to come to a compromise between you. Or you may have to find someone who has similar expectations or is more willing to compromise. Or maybe you need time for youself for a while, to build yourself up again, both for your own health and that of your future relationships. You would carry some trauma from your past, yes? Are you in therapy, because it would be very hard to work through trauma on your own.

Hope my two-sided helped. Good luck"
Nice.... Except he had plenty of time to purge the phone and he didn't really address any of your concerns. Hope everything turns out to not be what I think it is.
"All of those selfies sound like normal goofy stuff that friends share. 

&gt;a selfie of me hiding under a blanket pretending to be a babushka doll

If your bf seriously thinks you sending that to a longtime friend before you even met him is inappropriate, he is nutso. 

&gt;Simon maintains that sending a guy selfies of any kind is flirtatious. He wants to break up because he feels like the fiasco with Chris was partly my fault.

Oh my stars and garters! You dared to show your face to men? You incorrigible hussy, you. "
"Yes, I agree he definitely doesn't want to be the bad guy here. A couple weeks ago he emailed Sarah's mother (I know, he forwarded me the email), who is also a devout baptist. He essentially asked her mother to not tell Sarah and asked if the mother thinks they should get a divorce (after outlining all the things that are wrong).

I really like Greg, a lot. I want to talk boys with him like I do my other gay friends. But I can't stand what he's doing to her. I think rescinding the friendship there, until he comes clean, is a good idea."
I don't really see how their personal relationship details are your business though. You seem really overly involved and judgemental of his relationship.
"Even men who really wanted to be dads find this period of all-consuming maternal love hard to bear - for him it must be intolerable.

By all means be raw and honest, but I *strongly* advise doing it in a safe mediated environment such as a couples therapist. Otherwise one of you will say ANOTHER regrettable-if-true thing, that kills this marriage."

"I agree with you that it is rude, but judging from her responses I think she needs to hear it in a rude way.

She makes $100,000 a year, refuses to elaborate about child support aside from the fact that it allegedly is out of the question, and her SO already subsidizes her lifestyle in terms of housing, why is she continuing to look for validation that he should give more? By her own admission he is a positive role model in their lives, but in the end her only concern is his money being used for her children. 

What if he wasn't around? Would she be struggling? It sounds like her lifestyle isn't as easy as she wishes it was by having a fellow high earner around, which makes it sound like his primary use to her IS his money. For arguments sake the difference in earnings could be explained by him having chosen to focus on his career and her having to split time between working and rearing children, but why does that entitle her to his finances?

She sees that the the general consensus is against her previously understood mindset and has now switched to saying ""now what about if he actually becomes their step father one day?""

I know families that make due on less than $100,000 between two parents, I'm afraid I don't empathize with this situation outside of OP sounding greedy."
"Hats never said he forced her. He said he pressured her and told her she had to do it; both of those things are objectively true. It's very telling that you're equating those two statements with him ""forcing her"", actually. "
It sounds like you're saying you really didn't calculate things through carefully enough and now you're hurting. Is that accurate?

"Hey - I might be way off with this story but I just saw this play out with my best friend and her now ex boyfriend so I want to share:

He was 26 and well employed but living at home with his parents because he likes to mess around with cars. It's a very expensive hobby for him and I don't know the full extent of it, aside from hearing that he paid $35k for a *used* Cadillac sports car that he had to drive 500 miles to pick up. Seems dumb but hey, it's not my thing.

She had to leave him because it got ridiculous that every single decision in his life was ruled by cars. ""Sorry, can't go on a date next Friday because my best friend (who lives 2 miles away) is coming over to work on cars."" Rinse and repeat, every week, for over a year. He was coming over to her apartment whenever he didn't have other plans, the apartment she struggled to afford and pay for (she also has two jobs!), and it never occurred to him that this arrangement might cause her to become bitter after some time.

Basically, he prioritized his time and money on his hobby. My best friend suffered for it, both financially and emotionally. Now the ex is free to find another girl who shares his hobby, I guess."
"No you shouldn't ask her to take the ex's photos down. She should do it on her own because she wants to. She doesn't.

Living together seems convenient at this time but I would not say it means you are ""sort of serious"". If you think this is a BIG red flag, you are correct."
"&gt; He has a history of being manipulative. I think his fear of losing me is overwhelming him

Girl, I am legit kind of scared for you right now. I remember hearing in the comments of this subreddit about a girl who was climbing out of depression after her sister died unexpectedly, and her boyfriend destroyed a handmade candle that was nearly all she had to remember her sister by because he was afraid she would leave him once she was no longer depressed. He tried to shove her back down into depression!

If you're not ready to break up with your boyfriend, I'm really afraid your boyfriend is going to sabotage your medication. A lot of medications take weeks to MONTHS to stabilize, and if he throws out your pills or something and you miss a week, you'll have to start all over again.

Best of luck with the depression (my brother was severely depressed in high school, medication was the kickstart his brain needed to remember what the correct balance of chemicals was supposed to be), and be very careful with the boyfriend!"
"This is going to sound harsh, but -  It sounds like you're being a bit two faced. You shouldn't ignore the fact that Greg is gay and planning to leave her when she's talking about this. It sounds like she's the one that's really going to need support, not Greg. If you want to be Greg's confident then that's ok - but you shouldn't go along gaslighting her on his behalf. Dropping your friendship with her is preferable to lying about the truth of the situation.  "
"Well, yeah, being poly means you want to fuck other people. It's not her definition, it's *the* definition. Obviously polyamory entails a lot more than just that, but you wouldn't be polyamorous if you didn't want to fuck other people."
"Obviously this was the right thing to do. It's the best thing for your feelings, you say so yourself, and he's a cheating asshole who only wants you for sex.  I don't understand how this is even a question.  "
Just curious. Because of your ptsd did you pick a Law Enforcement Officer as a partner because it makes you feel more secure?

"What good is there to come of this? What is your angle/point? I'm having a hard time following why you think as she is grieving the loss of her mother, that telling her how her dad died should be brought up.

Do you have some form off autism, because I mean this in the nicest way- how can you not know social cues? This is highly inappropriate for you to even bring up. "

"Spoken like a true 20 year old...

Be careful, OP. This is a major surgery. It might seem like a dream come true but really consider all the angles here. If your friend hasn't really ever been like this before, she might be walking away from the car crash of your life that she is powerless to stop. Sometimes that's all you can do as a friend. This situation, as a women in my 30's and a mom, is ringing 800 kinds of alarm bells for me. I would be really not okay with my daughter doing something like this and would hope she really thought it through. 
FWIW, I have no issue with breast implants or other body modifications HOWEVER - you're so young and there is no rush for you to make these kinds of decisions, especially when you could do it when you're more established and pay for it entirely on your own rather than have some random guy you've been seeing for 8 weeks pay half.

"That's the most logical explanation because you went into the thought exercise believing OP to be completely innocent and her boyfriend to be guilty.

The most logical explanation, in my opinion, is she's lying.

Yeah you need to tell family to stop telling your mum when you're doing things. Especially your sister
"OP hasn’t given any description of the ring, so I wouldn’t jump to conclusions that it is a diamond solitaire or some other traditional engagement ring looking style. Hop on over to /r/weddingplanning and you’ll see tons of rings that are non traditional that people use as engagement rings. Since OP and his girlfriend have been together for over a year, it’s not that unusual that coworkers who see her wearing a ring they haven’t seen before on that finger may wonder if OP proposed. "

"Speaking as a chronically ill person myself, my partner has often expressed how frustrated and sad he is that there is nothing he can do to ease my pain. It is very hard for him (and for you, I'm betting) to watch the person you love go through a chronic condition and feel so helpless to, well, help. For me personally I feel very guilty that I not only have to go through those things, but that I put him through it too. I constantly wish I was a healthy person so we both wouldn't have to deal with the stress. I feel like a burden, I wish I had more energy to go out at night and have fun but I just can't, and as much as my partner assures me I'm not a burden I still feel that way a lot. I'm sure your girlfriend feels the same way.

My advice is, truly take some time to think if you can handle it or not. By the sounds of your post you really do love her, but no one will fault you if you believe you aren't strong enough to handle it. You both deserve to be happy, whatever that happiness looks like."
"&gt;It may be part of my responsibility to help her figure it out too.

Do you want a partner with agency, who is motivated to successed on their own merit, or do you want someone who you have to push (ie: nag) to get motivated about THEIR life?

&gt;(I've had a number of friends who graduated with major, and later moved to a career which had nothing to do with their degree

I also have friends who graduated with one degree and then got a job that didn't involve their degree at all...but THEY GOT A JOB.  And they didn't need coaxing to do it.  They just wanted to be able to pay their bills.

&gt;I think I'm definitely influenced by my friends/classmates/peers who are successful (doctors, dentists, lawyers, business, etc) so being career oriented is almost a norm for me.

I have a wide variety of friends, from struggling artists to lawyers, and even though some of them aren't career oriented, they still understand that they need an income. 

*I think that's probably what is more off putting to you.  Not that she isn't career oriented, but that she seems to have no motivation to be self-sufficient.*

&gt;As for my GF's shutting down, she hasn't matured yet. She likes to be babied. (She grew up as the youngest daughter in the family).

Come on. You know that's a crock.  I'm the youngest of *six*.  My nickname with in my family is ""Baby-JSLondon"", and I'm a 32 year-old-man! She doesn't like to be ""babied"". She like to have someone else support her. 

I think that if this relationship continues without getting clarification from her on these points, then you're going to get more of a ""dependent"" and less of a ""partner"".

Sure there are times I’m not great at it, but I work hard to make sure that people know and when I don’t tell them ahead of time to be patient when they ask. 

Your gf does none of those things. In my experience, people who say they “aren’t good at communicating” and are “just assholes” say it because they have no interest in making a change and think admitting it somehow makes it better. It doesn’t. Your gf doesn’t care about your feelings. Not only does she refuse to communicate with you, she says things to intentionally hurt your feelings when you get upset about it. Doesn’t exactly sound like a healthy relationship to me..."
"I don't think I can link it in this sub, but if you Google ""bride kidnapping vice,"" you will find a short documentary aimed at a western audience from a few years ago about what sounds like pretty much the exact kind of fake kidnapping you had. Honestly, from the perspective of someone who isn't familiar with this, I could see how they wouldn't be willing  to accept your characterization of the situation because it's so different from their experience. I think the easiest way to abate the suspicions is to direct people to watch the video and thereby confirm that the ""consensual kidnapping"" tradition is actually a thing and is not necessarily something sinister.

"I think she probably sees 2 years or so as something other than ""right off the bat."" It is of course perfectly fine for him not to want to be a stepdad, but I'd say that if what she ultimately wants is a coparent for her son, 2 years in isn't an unreasonable amount of time to begin testing that. It sounds to me like they're just not on the same page with him being a coparent, and maybe they should break up if they can't align. "

"Your bf doesn't sound so committed to a relationship with you. The fact that he was lying to you about how far he went at the strip club and was considering hiring a stripper to cheat on you are huge red flags. The issue here is the lying as much as or more than him actually going to the strip club and you have plenty of reason not to trust this dude anymore. This sort of betrayal definitely is cause for break up IMO and if you two have already been having issues, maybe this is a sign to just move on."
"Don't underestimate internalized homophobia and Catholic guilt combined, too. I think those things combined are about as powerful as a life of being a Southern Baptist. He also probably feels incredibly guilty and wants her to do the dumping so he can be absolved of some blame. Plus, coming out is scary.

It all just really sucks, and is more common than you think. I am sure she knows he wants a divorce and that's why she's so miserable. I would only intervene if he starts cheating on her or something. As of right now, all you can do is support and gently nudge them in the right direction."

"The lying/hiding the full truth is an issue but can be worked through with a bit of effort and full transparency from hereon in.

Don't conflate ""you hid something important from me"" with ""I'm worried about the future"" because they're separate issues, and should be dealt with independently. Deal with the woman you know and the evidence of your own eyes, not random worries you have about other people's experiences."

HAHA, always the victim. Isn't ANY money better than NO money?

&gt;My mother had mentioned to me several times that she is going to be in the delivery room. I didn’t think anything of it as she is my mother and was a L&amp;D nurse

First off, WAS an L&amp;D nurse. Second off, YOUR WIFE is having the baby and ONLY SHE gets to decide who is in the birth room. No one in their right mind would just assume they are going to be there.

&gt;She then went on to tell wife that it is fine, she would not be in the delivery room but expect for her to come over daily until she felt the baby was “safe.” And after that she would have weekly Saturday visits at her home.

OH HELL NO. This is beyond offensive and rude and just down right disgusting, what a horrible person your mother is.

&gt; I had no idea about this and felt it was a little overkill, I mean I love my mom but I don’t think she needs that much time with our baby but whatever. My wife and I are perfectly capable of keeping our son safe, I was really upset by this comment.

Not upset enough, apparently. you should have immediately cut contact with your mother. ""but whatever"" is not an acceptable way to respond to this comment AT ALL.

&gt;Wife flipped out again. Told her that she will not speak to her and that she will not meet her grandchild, she is tired of her controlling our marriage and me, it was ending now. 

Good for her!

&gt;My mother stormed off and sent me a long text about how she is just trying to be friends with my wife but she hopes I see how it is not possible. 

Always the victim, of course.

&gt;My wife is telling me that she is sick of being married to me and my mother. That I need to cut contact and deal with my issues. 

YES!

&gt;But when she married me, she knew how close we were. 

NO NO NO. When YOU married HER, you made her a promise that she was the most important person in your life. YOU are the one breaking your vows.

&gt;She said she is stopping the automatic bank transfers as we should be saving that money for our baby and not giving to my lazy mother. 

Should have done that a long time ago. Yes, your mother is lazy and always the victim.

&gt;She offered me an ultimatum, obviously I want to be with my wife and our son. She is my world. But I don’t think I should have to sacrifice my mother/son relationship for it quite so drastically.

WRONG WRONG WRONG. YOU promised to put your WIFE first when YOU MARRIED HER.

OP, cut contact (for now), get in therapy and deal with this horrible person you have for a mother."
"Your career has to come first at your age and if your gf isn't able to be supportive of it, then maybe you two aren't meant to be for the long term. "
I’d be like...  what the fork is this?
"I'm not even sure this is ""clinger"" behavior, to me it sounds much worse. From her description, it sounds a whole lot more like he has a need to control her."
"Agree about this.

Also, if you haven't ever dealt with abusers or crazy people, when somebody asks you a question - especially if they're somebody you consider family/close to you - you answer that question.  You don't immediately assume they're trying to stop you from going to the bathroom - you assume they have a reason for why they need an answer right now."
"I'm sorry to have to point this out OP but your parents think of you as their walking wallet. I would suggest you stop sharing your bank account and pay a fixed amount as rent. Let them learn to manage on a fixed amount cause when you move out, they can take boarders. Save up and move out. Your mom will do whatever she can to break up your relationships because you being single = you staying at home and that means access to your bank account. Your dad will have good intentions but will enable your mom because he doesn't want to be yelled at. "
"this would be a very logical explanation if he'd used the wrapper as a reason to break up. since they stayed together it seems a bit less likely, but he does seem to use it as leverage in arguments, so... quite convenient, actually. ""[bf], i'm sick of you not cleaning up after yourself, we live in a pigsty!"" ""yeah? well what about that condom wrapper, huh?!""."
"Should she also pat him on the head and give him a gold star when he behaves like a functioning adult? 

If he knows this is an issue and isn't willing to put in a good faith effort to change his ways they have bigger problems. 

We already know he can cook, he can read recipes, he knows the names of the meals he eats for dinner. This isn't him not knowing where to begin or being clueless in the kitchen,  this is him knowing that his wife will cook dinner for him if he just doesn't bother or if he purposely cooks food she doesn't like.

"I guess I'm having trouble figuring out why you're taking care of a friend of a friend's cat for an extra 6 months. Why can't she take care of her own cat? The only thing I can find is that she doesn't have a place to live. So, where is she staying? 

At this point, you've shown you will watch the cat indefinitely, and by accepting a few bucks here and there for food and litter, you're saying you're ""okay with keeping the cat as is."" Have the two of you discussed her plans for the future at all? I think it's time to light a fire under her and get the momentum going.

Finally, it's not your responsibility to pay for the cat if it gets sick or injured. It's not your cat. If the time comes, you should immediately call the friend of a friend, and have her come with you. Don't go alone (unless it's an absolute emergency), because it looks like you'll end up fronting the costs and never get it back. "
"To be honest, I would say it's best to suck it up and go. You've had a different type of lifestyle than her family, and often a blue collar family will have to share rooms just as a matter of necessity. Declining could give them the impression that you're stuck up and think you're better than them. It may be a bit awkward, but it seems very important to your girlfriend and is something you will probably have to get used to if you want your current relationship to get more serious."
"Your boyfriend is kind of a jerk. It's not kind to lead on another person, it's not kind to throw his current girlfriend under the bus to appease this other person. He only apologetic when he had to deal with your rightfully negative feelings towards him.

There's a reason he hasn't shut this down already. His female best friends are even pointing this out, it appears this woman was an issue with a previous relationship. I think he should end his friendship with this woman. I think it's a good step but be on the lookout for him not really ending it."
Okay this is illegal. Just wanted to check you were legally a minor and as you are you should follow other commenters advice. 
"I wouldn't say OP's wife is ruining the family, but rather not protecting it. I'd put the ruining part on the SIL as she's the one actively doing the damage.

But I agree with the rest - a parent's job is to protect their kids and OP's wife is failing here.

I really hope OP shows this post and these comments to his wife and it serves as a wake up call. As a non-favored grandchild, I can say it can really do a number on you."
"I tend to agree... this sounds like some odd grooming behavior leading up to some danger for OP. Besides that, if she's concerned, she needs to call somebody. She knows what she's living with. She knows it feels weird. Her senses are telling her to do something before it gets worse. 

And a 16-year-old girl ought to be able to enforce some boundaries about her personal space in the home. She should not have her mom's ""guests"" roaming through her room uninvited (by her) and/or unannounced."
"She has decided you guys are done. You don't get a say; you can't force her to be in a relationship with you simply because you are now doing better. The damage is done, and I guarantee that if she's divorcing you now after all this time, then she's not going to come back. She most likely checked out of the relationship years ago, and has only just gotten everything together to make the break she's wanted for a while.

Your disorder does not excuse all your past behavior. It provides context and a roadmap to improvement, but some things cannot be fixed. Move on and let her have her divorce. You can still be there for your kids in a meaningful way."
"If this was a case where she was just inexperienced, I'd suggest that you stick with it, be patient, don't push, and she will eventually warm up to you and start rocking your world.

It doesn't sound like that is the case here.  It sounds like she either has major hangups from her upbringing, or past trauma.  I'm guessing hangups but I could be wrong.

In either case, I think you are maybe pushing her faster and farther than she's ready for.  She's going to have to work through her issues before she's able to embrace the type of sex life you're looking for.  I would shift the conversation from asking ""what do you like in bed?"" to ""it seems like you are a little uncomfortable when i ask you things related to sex. is that my imagination, or is it causing discomfort to you?""  if that conversation proves impossible, it absolutely does not make you a douche to break up over it.  Just tell her that you feel there are incompatibilities you can't get past."

Run as fast as you can. I'm being honest. So sorry if it sounds mean. But I was in that same situation once. It ended in 3 years of scary abuse that should've killed me and a personal protection order against him.
"You said these outbursts are not uncommon and that she’s selfish, which your post backs up. I don’t think it’s tied to her being “sick and lost,” I think she’s just an asshole. I know plenty of “sick and lost” people who are still able to treat others with decency despite stress."
"It’s even worse when you look at his age. At first glance, I thought he was 24, and I was all, ‘Jesus, dude, you’re not in high school anymore; get it together...’ But he’s actually _34_, which just takes this to a new level of appalling."
"these comments are ridiculous. she's a cheating abuser? really? being snappy occasionally is not abuse. 

OP, just talk to her, gently, and let her know how her behavior hurts your feelings, and that you're always there to talk if she's stressed. you may need to meet her in the middle and try to ask her fewer questions. TBH, can see how she'd be kind of annoyed by you asking her several questions about getting a glass of water, even though you likely had good intentions. "
"&gt;he’s starting to neglect OP for

"On top of talking to a professional at your school, please recognize that this is wrong, and an emotional minefield. Some professionals may not want to get involved in a conflict like this, and if you encounter resistance move on and try to find someone who can help you. There are people who can help, keep fighting until you find one. 

I agree with others here, get evidence. If you can, back up the chat log from your end in case your mom tries to delete it all, as well as pictures of it on her computer. 

After that, I would tell your friends and their parents. Who knows what other information she has been gathering, or who else might be involved.

After you have established a support person and gave your friends the heads up I would bring the evidence to your mother (with the help of a support person) and tell her what you know. She might try to lie, she might not. You will know if she does.

This is a major invasion on healthy boundaries and relationships, and obviously your mother has a lot of work to do to mend her own issues. You deserve better, I'm so sorry. I hope you have people in your life that you can feel safe talking to, not all of us are like this."
"Went “official” yesterday with the woman I’ve been seeing for almost two months now. She is an amazing human being. We’re so compatible, and have so much fun together.

I can’t believe I met her on Tinder... it’s still very new, but I’m so fucking excited for what the future holds for us :D"

"I've actually experienced this before and it's super frustrating. She was absolutely beautiful but for some reason she just didn't appeal to me sexually very much. She took care of herself, she dressed well and always put in the effort to look good, but I just didn't *want* her and I could never understand why.

My advice? Break up. It's too painful to be with someone who doesn't want you like you want them."
"I had a girlfriend who would constantly write me letters and give me cards etc. At first it was cute but then it got overwhelming for me to get that kind of presents almost on a daily basis but I didn't tell her because she seemed happy doing it. But yeah, I got pretty tired of it and the relationship suffered for it.

Also, I don't think the letters where the only intense thing you did. Were you also constantly talking to her via social media or phone, or also wanting to see her a lot?"
"&gt; She said she had started praying recently and it helps her a little bit

Jesus those intimate scenarios were adorable! 
"There's two things here. It's inconsiderate of you to say ""Hey you guys can't talk about this great thing you have in common or be friends"" but it's also inconsiderate of them, mostly your boyfriend, of not trying to be more inclusive when you're all together. However it doesn't sound malicious, but rather he's probably just getting really caught up in this unexpected and surprising friendship. 

Can you express these feelings to him? Say something like ""Hey I know you and gramps have this great connection and everything but sometimes I feel like you're more excited to see him than me. Would you be alright if we could spend more quality time together and if I could spend some one-on-one quality time with my grandpa?"" then ask the same thing of your grandpa."
Ughhhhh. This makes me so sad. I hope she comes to her senses in time.
"&gt; Am I right to think that’s at least as bad as if he had beaten her, and that she needs to break up with him?

Nope. It is **worse** because that can actually kill a person, this is edging into attempted murder territory. Don't be surprised if she stays with this guy, one day, it comes out on the news that a woman has been murdered by her partner by choking. 

I'm not sure what actions you can take, but research what methods would be the most effective in your country. "
Yes! This is 100% truth. 
You sound like you have a cool gf. This gender roles problem is all in your head. 
"I’m about to be 36 and I’d rather have my loved ones text me during the day. I’m busy, you’re busy.. doesn’t mean I don’t care about you. We can chat later, like when I’m not working/or you’re not working. Sometimes we are all just busy. 

P.s. though... if this is something that bothers you OP, casually just bring it up. My fiancé is a chef, I’m fully aware that if it’s a Friday night at 7 pm, he’s not going to text back immediately. But even then, I hear from him as soon as he can. "
I also find jealousy to be self reinforcing. So make an active effort to move your thoughts away from jealous. Stomp it out with rationality each time it comes up. It’s easier to feed jealousy than it is to manage it. But it’s damaging long term. 
"Glad I’m not the only one the see the difference. Stalking your ex- MAYBE I can agree you’re looking for closure.

"Yep, this. I had an ex that attempted to give me the promise ring his ex wore during their relationship. He was furious that I didn’t want anything to do with it.There’s a reason he’s my ex. Don’t reuse anything. I’m sure she’ll love how much thought you’ve put into her ring, especially thinking of her allergies! If she likes color, I would almost encourage you to consider a sapphire or emerald. They’re amazingly strong and stunning, and you should also look into lab-created stones. I have a background in chemistry; they’re exactly the same, and far more ethical. 
High-priced “natural” stones are a total scam and completely unnecessary. Get a beautiful, strong lab stone and spend the extra money on an amazing honeymoon! 
Just my opinion though; I’d consult your fiancé or her close friends about a ring that’ll really show her personality. "
"If I may interpret: you are maybe ""young at heart,"" but your outsides are probably quite wrinkly and old-looking. There are plenty of women in their 40-50s who are young at heart, but you're obviously turned off by their wrinkly outsides.

To be perfectly frank: the type of young women (20-26 year olds) who are willing to date older men (51) are going to be **strongly motivated** by your generosity. 

It's why sugar baby websites exist."
"If I were you, I'd look for a full time employee job that has a consistent salary and medical benefits (assuming you're in the US, anyway).

Kids are expensive, but there's also a lot of room for how much you need to spend. Hand-me-down clothes from friends saved my wife an I a lot of money. Also got most furniture and carseats and stuff second hand or hand-me-down. The only thing you really need to buy new are diapers and wipes and butt cream."
"as others have said, it sounds like you still don't have the full story.

That being said, if the full story involves even worse things, like her being underage when the ""affair"" started, it may feel messed up to you and it may color the way you see her, but I guarantee no matter how you feel about it, her feelings are WAAAAAY more complicated. This is the kind of stuff that defines a person in ways they can't even see. This is likely incredibly shameful for her, and telling you any of it was probably very hard to do. Chances are she is constantly fearful that people will find out and judge her for it and treat her like a pariah.

These are things you never really get over, and all she wants is for it to not be the only thing you see when you look at her. If you want to continue being in a relationship, you have to internalize this as being entirely her stepfather's fault, which it is. Even if she was 20 when the actual physical relationship began, it probably really started long before then in the form of manipulation and psychological abuse. Basically, he needed to turn her into the kind of person who would sleep with her mom's husband.

So it's up to you if you let it define her for you. But the truth is most people have (at least) one great shame in their life, the thing that's the hardest to tell our SOs because we're certain they will see us as unlovable as soon as they find out. If you don't have one, you're a better man than I. But real love is about choosing partnership, it's about choosing to accept the shame as simply part of the fabric of that person's being. It's not a critical fault, it's a highly formative experience, and she wouldn't be the person she is today if that stuff hadn't happened. All she wants is for someone to tell her it's okay, that she's still deserving of love.

"At the very least, speak up about feeling left out/neglected.  It's rude to consistently speak in a language others don't understand.  Understandable in situations like this, but not excessively to the point where you are constantly excluding ONE person.  It's not unreasonable to want to have dinner with your boyfriend.  She doesn't need to point out it's her grandfather taking up all the time--just that if he is really interested in the relationship, he needs to be an equal partner.

"Locks. On everything you can slap a lock on. Buy boxes with locks on them, buy locks you can put on your drawers, **everything**.

And fuck her passive aggression. Get confrontational. No more sharing. Don't attack her obviously but call her out, make her uncomfortable, make her feel unwelcome. Stop playing defense.

She'll either change her tune or run crying to the RA. And if that doesn't work, steal her shit too."
Why are you looking to get serious with somone with a kid when you don't want kids? What's a possible good result here? 
"Address it as ""this effects your day to day life, I would be much more comfortable if you were managing this with a professional like a psychologist or psychiatrist."" Don't make ""whether or not they have OCD"" the hill to die on. Stick to ""if you have an illness, mental or physical, I need for you to cooperate with a care team to manage it and be comfortable in this relationship.""

You'll find out a lot about why they were so keen on self-diagnosis when you talk about managing it. "
Ummm the guy can still be an ass.
"&gt;he was increasingly friendly, even admitting his attraction to me. I admitted that there was certainly a mutual feeling, but didn't let it progress.

So instead of backing off and saying “that’s inappropriate, you have a girlfriend” you played on into it and escalated. Nice. By nice I mean pretty scummy.

&gt;From then, it's been very flirtatious over texts.

Literally ONE sentence before you try to say you didn’t let it progress, that’s obviously not true. Be honest with us and yourself.

&gt;I assumed/hoped he was maybe going through a rough patch 

More examples of stellar character on your part.

&gt;But they are still very inappropriate on his end, for a man who is recently engaged.

Literally what is the difference? Why did you think it was fine for him to act like a dogshit human being to a girlfriend but now that it’s a fiancée, you think it’s wrong? I think it’s because you hoped he’d cheat and/or leave his girlfriend for you and now you see it as too much trouble to undo something so big. 

&gt;As the single one, I'm still watching myself to make sure not to go too far.

It astounds me to my core that someone in your position could write this without a hint of irony or sarcasm. It is beyond belief. You have been; inappropriate, unethical, unempathetic, self centered, and hypocritical. You absolutely crossed the line when you knew he had a girlfriend and didn’t shut him down. You’ve been crossing the line further and further since. Don’t excuse yourself, you’ve done wrong and been part of an emotional affair. 

&gt;I've learned my lesson so I don't need ""This is why you don't flirt with men in relationships""

Well that’s not true considering throughout the post you imply that you were super ethical and never crossed any lines when that’s absurd. A paragraph before you said you’ve never crossed the line “as a single person,” when it’s just not true. You need to accept your missteps here or you won’t learn anything meaningful from them.

You don’t do anything. Don’t text him anymore. Just let it go. It’s not someone you’re going to continue to have any meaningfully deep and/or positive report with. Now that you know you crossed lines, you need to leave him alone because that’s the appropriate way to behave now. If you wind up working there, be professional and don’t text about anything other than strictly necessary business.

"She broke things off because I was becoming invested in the relationship to an unhealthy degree. I was going through a bout of depression, I had stopped spending time with my friends, wasn't investing in my career, stopped taking care of my body. I was really displeased with a lot of things in my life and tried to fill those holes in my life with the relationship. I sought professional help because I was so sick of being sad. That was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I'm in such a better place now but I still see my counselor a couple times a month.

TL;DR: I stopped taking care of myself and became too invested in the relationship"
"The entire point of the love languages stuff is to help couples realize they have different needs and attempt to mutually meet those needs. It's not meant to be a free pass for one half of the couple to say ""I don't like your needs, so I'm not going to meet them."" "
"I'm really sad for you that you've decided this is the kid of life you want for yourself. Like, legit sad. "

"My whole life is a set of weird comical/tragic things like this. I have an engagement ring worth 20K on my finger (chosen by him and his family), while I'm rocking clothes from Ross and own 4 pairs of shoes. 
See how entitled that sounds? I'm lucky to have the ring. The rest of my life just doesn't match."
"Quick aside: you are child-less, not childfree. Childfree means that you intend to never have children, biological or otherwise."
"So he's willing to participate if you do all the work and planning? How kind.

Girl - read your post, and all your comments back to yourself - I don't care what he makes, or what you make - it's just not worth it. This isn't a partnership. 

I saw he's complaining about wedding costs, and having to cover them, while you feel embarrassed trying to scrounge for a dress appropriate for the type of wedding he wants - this is insanity. 

This isn't a partnership, you're a live in maid &amp; sex trophy that pays him for the honor of being as much. I'm not saying the guy should buy you the moon, but this isn't normal. It's not normal to buy someone a $20k engagement ring, but refuse to lend that same partner the money for necessary medical procedures and dental work. Most normal people - even those with ""regular"" incomes wouldn't just let their soon to be spouse suffer when they can help with the problem. 

I literally cannot imagine a world where my husband, or, frankly, my dog for that matter, needed a medical procedure done and instead of stepping up and helping, I handed them a piggy bank and said good luck. Did that visual feel bad? I'm betting that it did because you know that's what your fiance is doing here. 

This isn't really about the money at all - it's about the selfishness, the unsupportive behavior, and the apparent relentless negging that this guy has done to convince you that it's totally normal and appropriate for him to show you less care and empathy than most people do their pets. Is he going to let you go on the honeymoon, or will you be sitting this one out when he picks a place you can't afford?

I'm sorry for being so harsh, OP, but I am hoping that you see all these outsiders perspectives, and take them to heart, because no one deserves to be treated like a second class citizen by their partner."
"This girl likes to be chased and desired, she asking you to proof you love to her by making you jump though a latency of loops to ""reassure"" her so she feels better about her self, she needs help and is on a self destructive path I had a gf just like this, trust me mate just block her she goes from one extreme to the other, she sounds immature, jealous, has anxiety issues which she uses to try and get her way and make you feel sorry for her shes not ready for a relationship. Its like she seeing how much she can get away with and then trys to play victim when you stand up for yourself. She could be pushing you away because she don't feel she deserves you idk im not her but I do know that you don't need this sort of drama in your life."
"&gt; We've discussed this many times over the years and in the past it's generally come down to attributing it to her anxiety. 

Let me understand this.  You have been with this girl since she was 19 and no one has ever expected anything of her because she has anxiety?   Has she been on medication and/or in therapy to help her assume a normal amount of responsibility like all the others who suffer from the same condition?

Now that you have finished school and expect to embark on a career, exactly what are you expecting from Emily...more of the same?   What's going to happen when she drops out of this demanding program?  Or even if she finishes, what then?.   She's still functioning like a 19-year old while you have taken responsibility for planning for your own future.

"Why should you have to put up with that behaviour? If she really believes it's a problem then she wouldn't drink.

I don't think being drunk is an excuse to dump on the people you love and say horrible things to them. You dont get a ""i was drunk pass"" in the morning.  

I'd tell her that if she wants a relationship with you she needs to stop drinking but honestly, I think you are better off with someone who respects your relationship enough to listen when you tell her something is a problem. 

You and I both know that if the cops were called  it would be your ass on the line unless you had solid proof she was the one who was acting crazy. Protect yourself and either leave or get her to commit to no drinking.

Edit: changed a word"
"I don't think she should apologize. She didn't cause the disturbance, and the idea that she's the problem here needs to be shut down hard. Nornally, sure, apologize just to smooth things over, but in this situation I feel like it's VERY important that the narrative follows reality rather than ""OP's over reacting is the real inconvenience here."" She should be accepting exactly 0% of the blame in this."
"Dude, no. For you it’s one night of wearing a dress you don’t like. For her it’s her wedding and she wants everything to be perfect. You can deal, suck it up."
Yes block her on every social media platform and also block her phone number 
"&gt; Honestly the thought of waking up without her next to me is crushing me and I know she feels the same.  

This is weakness.  

This is a basic biological fear inside of you. It's the fear of change. This weakness is why beaten girlfriends stay with their violent boyfriends. It's why miserable people stay miserable at miserable jobs. It's why sick people continue to slowly die rather than taking care of their illness.  

Don't let the fear of change paralyze you.  

She cheated on you.  
She never told you about it.  
She lied to your face when you found out.  

This wasn't the first time it happened, and this won't be the last time. Your girlfriend has loose morals and the only reason you didn't know about this earlier is because she's bad at making friends. But now you know. She's a liar and a deceiver.  

Dump her ugly ass."
"&gt; She said she can’t tell her therapist because her mom goes into their sessions now

Your girlfriend's mom is actively ruining her therapy sessions. This needs to stop. There are very few good reasons for a parent to be intruding on a personal therapy sessions (there's a lotta red-flag-reasons, though, like a controlling parent).

Your girlfriend needs to kick her mum out of her sessions, and then use the sessions to bring up her teacher crushes. The sessions are supposed to be about her, and this is affecting her life in a negative way so she should be free to talk about it with a professional.

&gt; she doesn’t want an adult to know because she thinks they’ll find it weird.

This is a BS excuse, but honestly it makes a lot of sense with her mom being in the room. Hopefully this excuse will disappear once the mom problem is sorted, but if not, remind her that therapists are bound by confidentiality and hear a lot weirder stuff than this every single day.

Your GF may need to find a new therapist. Having her mom involved may have already ruined her relationship with her current one, so watch out for that. If the trust is gone just find a new one."
"Seriously, I don't know how OP can possibly think she was blackout drunk given her story.

"Like how crazy are we talking here as it can make a difference, because I have a friends and family I will not drive with because of their driving. 

However I think you might be over aware of what's going on in a car, when you are driving with someone. I understand because of your accident you are very sensitive to this, like how fast someone is going or going around corners too fast.

When really, your father doesn't really sound like that crazy of a driver sounds pretty normal at least where I live in rural Canada. 
However that doesn't really make it okay for to ignore your requests because being in a car at all bothers you nevermind going faster than you are comfortable with. 

If you would've said your dad was cutting people off, was on his phone the whole time, and just not pay attention to the road I would say he is an outright crazy and dangerous driver.

From what I've read, you said he sped about 10-20 km/h over the limit, which at least where I live is more or less the actual speed limit. The posted signs say 90, but most everyone drives 100-110, as that is the flow of traffic. 

This your father's normal driving, its likely how he always drives as he probably wasn't driving like that just to scare you. 

However you are looking how to deal with your father regarding this, and honestly that's the hard part. I had a friend that would close her eyes whenever she was in a car because driving at all scared her, but I don't think that's a good solution for you. 

You need you fathers to understand that while your fears about driving are a little irrational, you have them for good reason because of your accident that you are still trying to work through them. 

Also what about taking a bus or a shuttle or something they generally don't speed, and at the very least the suggestion might make your dad understand how serious you are about this.

"I do hope you're having a wake up call here OP. Things need to change in your life with how you handle holidays. You are very, very close to divorce territory, even with giving her this Easter.

"""Leave me alone.""
""I'm not discussing this with you.""

Say it. Repeat it. Practice repeating it in the mirror if you'd like. Don't even get baited into answering any question at all. People accusing you of ""approving"" are just scumbags trying to manipulate you into telling them something interesting. Say those simple phrases as many times as you need too, loudly enough that it attracts attention of others. If you refuse to be embarrassed by their bad behavior, you can shame them into shutting up.

It takes a huge amount of willpower, but it's possible. These people have no business bullying teenagers over their mother's behavior or their parent's marriage. If you are utterly confident in that fact, you can express it clearly and they will back off.

With your father and mother you'll need to have more frank and honest conversations in time, but it sounds like right now both of your parents are avoiding those talks. For now, I'd suggest you wait for them to come to you."
If anything happens to her because of him and she wasn't warned...
"Emphasis on them rejecting the wedding. If they are not actively helping to contain this or at least supportive of OP and her fiance's efforts to do this, OP should seriously consider uninviting them too. I know OP thinks they will choose not to come but I believe they shouldn't get that choice.

This is a line that I think needs to be drawn and they should know that even if OP still invites them to make her day whole for herself, a step towards supporting Ken's behavior is a step away from OP.

"Sex work is “legit” if you’re in the .01% who have it made. Outside of that sex work is often people abusing other people for a ln experience that is very easily attainable from other people without financial transactions. Getting laid is not hard, paying to get laid is fine sure but it’s paying for something that we can all get if we just try.   OPs girlfriend is done trying and just wants to make cash by dong nothing. Sex work for a woman is work yes but it’s not a career like any other. If OPs girl really wanted to be with this guy and be a couple she would be trying to find a legit job. Ex-boyfriend to a chick who used to seek out sugar daddies. Long story short with that chic. She was lazy and unmotivated. Sweet girl but she threw away all her talents at the time for a quick paycheck and she ended up paying for it in a lot of ways. Don’t get in to sex work unless you’re willing to completely change your life."
Do you think she would've admitted to it if you didn't find out? 
I wouldn't want to deserve someone who has a habit of drunk driving. 
Sounds like an emotional affair but it still needs to be addressed.
People don't need to be insecure in order to feel uncomfortable with strangers knowing personal details about them. Some people are just really private and prefer to let people get to know them on their terms.

"You should definitely tell her. It's not easy to do, because he's going to try to claim that you still ""aren't over him"" or that you are jealous and that's why you are saying these things about him. Good luck!"
"Looking at your post history, I think you are getting way ahead of yourself. If all the posts are about your girlfriend, it sounds like you guys either have major compatibility issues or communication problems. 

Things like how you’d like to handle finances, child rearing and cohabitation should be discussed among the partners. If you have to ask strangers, then there’s a problem. I think the pregnancy has sent you into a tailspin of really wanting to make it work. 

If I were you, I’d think long and hard if you want to share your life with this woman. If she keeps the pregnancy, you are tied to her to the foreseeable future, but you are not required or obligated to marry her."
"just want to tell you something: I don't know how your friend would react, everyone is different, but I was living with my best friend a couple years ago and he had a 2 year old and was going through kind of a stressful time, and he started smacking his kid a little to hard (just on the arm but it could have progressed) and a little too often, and just generally blowing up a little too severely for a 2-3 year old. 

there was one particularly bad time where he was pissed about him not eating his dinner and smacked him and kinda threw him into his room and yelled pretty bad at him, and then did this weird overly affectionate ""I love you I love you"" thing, and that night I told him he was going too far and he was going to mentally scar the kid forever with that psycho shit. 

he got pretty sad and we had a good talk, but literally from that day forward he has never once gotten out of control ever. he still disciplines him normally, but he really took it to heart and changed, and I think it was that connection to the weird back and forth mentally scarring his kid that sunk it in.

what I'm saying is your roommates connection to his father is the perfect thing to help him realize what he's doing, how bad it is, how much it can fuck his kid up, and the perfect path for how *not* to behave. he has *lived* the exact wrong path, he *knows* what not to do. I really want to urge you to help your friend and I can only hope he's receptive. you have a perfect way to make him open his eyes. good luck. "
"&gt;most of their jokes are about me




They are being hurtful. If someone punched you in the face and then slapped your wife you wouldn't say that your wife should get over it because you did. She is still allowed to have her own feelings and reactions. Frankly I think you under-react which makes your wife's normal response seem over the top.





Asking her to hang out with your family means asking her to allow people to hurt her a little and watch someone she loves get hurt more. Just because you are ok with that doesn't mean she needs to be."
"He got away with kicking your dog, consequence free, even if it was just a liiiiitle kick. Next time you have a fight, he can look back and remember that hurting your dog hurt you. Next time it might be a broken rib or worse. Take your dog and get out, business be damned, because if you let him hurt your best friend to save your business, it will cost you more than money."
That's... not a great coping mechanism for him to model for your child.
You need to figure out a way to leave this person and move yourself and your children away from this abuser.

"If she says yes only after the relationship is threatened, you're crossing the boundary into coercion. That's definitely a worse approach than the one OP took."
"Personally I'd say confront your mother about it. As a nurse I can say how frustrating is working with patients who aren't all there mentally even though you know they can't help it. Since it's her own relative I'm sure it's easier to cross the line with your frustration. Be understanding and offer to help when she's becoming frustrated or overwhelmed. I'm sure it's very hard watching your mother slowly deteriorate and we all don't handle emotions the same way. If it continues after you bring it up to her, definitely call adult protective services."
"He did put in his two weeks notice. I'm not sure what he told them. Near the end of the two weeks, he realized it was going to be tougher than he thought, and I asked him, ""Maybe you can keep your job?"" but he didn't answer and went through with it anyway. I think he realized it was a mistake then, but just didn't want to admit it. 

That's always been his flaw, honestly, he really doesn't like to admit he's wrong. If I keep at him, and explain logically why he is wrong, he will eventually see and agree, but with this, he gets mad and will stop the conversation before I can get to that point. I think he knows he screwed up, and realizes he made a huge mistake, but doesn't want to say it out loud. "
"I don’t doubt that she has a severe case. I have a friend with an allergy to sesame seeds that’s about as severe as they come. If he ingests a single sesame seed, or if someone is cooking nearby with sesame oil, it can result in full blown anaphylaxis (throat closing, life threatening). He carries an Epi pen with him at all times, and he has to inform friends and anyone who cooks for him about his allergy. Apart from that, he lives a fairly normal life and did live in a dormitory during college. Students in the dorm were notified of the allergy and while I think he did have a couple episodes of anaphylaxis through the years he had his epi pen on him and it never became life threatening. 

I would be very careful suggesting that she is exaggerating her allergy, it probably is a very sensitive subject, but I think you do need to clarify with her where she got this information about apples not being allowed in the same building. There’s a huge difference between an allergy to something in a room, vs being allergic to something multiple rooms away behind closed doors. "
"Of course it matters. That's like saying religion, politics, or views on money and children ""shouldn't matter"" in relationships.

Being at vastly different life stages is a *huge* difference for two people to have. The younger is at a huge disadvantage due to inexperience, and most healthy 35-year-olds wouldn't even be considering being with someone barely removed from being a ""stupid teenager,"" even if they're technically ""legal.""

And yes, *everyone* was stupid when they were a teenager. That's how growing up works."
Be careful with counseling though. He sounds really manipulative and subtly abusive but still abusive. I bet he could have the counselor convinced you're the crazy one. Or that you both have equal problems you need to work on. Counseling with an abuser isn't recommended because it often makes the abuse worse because the counselor is approaching it like you two are both equals when that's clearly not the case.

"I watched Clannad and can agree that it made me more emotional than some important life events. It's designed to make you cry and it's nice once in a while to cry over a good show, while for other things that have more impact on his real life there are other people around and he has to do things and be rational about it so that's maybe why he doesn't cry then. "
"Your wife isn't holding a grudge. She's making a conscious choice to not include toxic people in her life. Everyone has the right to pursue a happy wholesome life and an important facet of this pursuit is the ability to choose the people you want in your life and in turn who you want out of your life. You need to respect that if you want your marriage to work long term.

Your family sucks dude. I mean only the trashiest people have the notion to outshine the bride and groom at a wedding. That isn't some kind of undesirable quirk. Your family is toxic and step #1 is to recognize this. You keep trivializing it like how you laugh about it now. How you laugh them off. I get it, they are your family and maybe you're accustomed to it and think it's normal or acceptable. (it isn't normal.) But that doesn't mean your wife has to endure their consistent toxicity.

What your wife is asking is 100% reasonable. She isn't telling you you have to sever ties with your family. She just wants nothing to do with them. If you want to be a doormat with your family and put up with their bullshit, go on ahead. Your wife doesn't have to be complicit in that.

You should stop reinforcing this notion that your family's shittiness isn't a big deal and your wife ""should laugh it off"". If you keep trivializing her feelings about this, it's eventually going to affect your relationship with her in a negative way."

"It sounds absolutely horrible to me. For me, living together is an integral part of being married, and I would only consider living apart from my spouse if it was a for a short/limited amount of time, and if it was absolutely necessary. If my spouse suggested what it sounds like you are suggesting (We'll buy you a new separate house so I don't have to give up my house or my cats or my alone time or compromise in any other way) I would be out of there as fast as my legs could carry me.

Now, I'm sure this arrangement isn't always bad...if you have two people who find it appealing then I'm sure it would work great for them. But in this case it sounds like your fiancee is not on board and you're looking for ways to convince her. This is not likely to work, and even if you ARE able to convince her I can't imagine her being ok with it for an extended period of time."
"This is an insane fucking request. Either your boyfriend understands that killing innocent animals out of revenge is sick, or he is not so great and level headed as you believed. "
This is very dangerous for you.  This is almost child abuse.  Any of these men could assault you . You have the right to feel safe in your home. If in school please talk to your school counselor. Start to work on an exit plan. If you can you may want to find a job so you can save.  Am I overreacting? Maybe. But this is your safety. Stay safe child. See if you can stay with friends or if there is any outreach in your community.
My guess is that you have to be quite immature to assume that people who aren’t insecure about their partner’s past have quite a history lol. 
"&gt; he seems like he actually wants to change

Nope. If he wanted to change he wouldn't have bailed out of therapy after three sessions denying there was a problem.

You're making the classic blunder of listening to words when you really need to listen to actions.

He won't change because so far this is working for him. He gets to use you for emotional labor, he can berate you when things go wrong, and you don't ever do much about it.

He will continue to be this way until circumstances force him not to be.

"Because it's what's important to her and it's what she needs as proof of your commitment. If you can't meet her (reasonable) needs, then move on and give her a chance to find someone who can. Relationships are about compromise and if you want to spend your life with this woman, I don't see what's the big deal about signing a contract with her to legally bind yourself to her. If it's the wedding that you're worried about, then talk to your gf and find a compromise with her about the wedding that works for you. "
"I'm the same in a lot of regards but I don't have depression and I feel like that is probably a large contributing factor to the advice I'm about to offer since clinical depression will zap energy and willpower like nothing else so take this with a grain of salt.

Whenever I try something new there will be about a week of ""ok this is tolerable"" and then a month or so of ""I hate this, I hate everything about this, I'm terrible at it, what is even the point"" but then if I can make it through that month and keep doing the thing I find my attitude does a complete 180 because now I'm halfway good at the thing or at least basically competent. Newcomers to the thing will start asking me for advice, older people compliment my improvement, and it's about this point I feel like part of the hobby and not this weird worm person flailing with knitting needles or a paintbrush. 

The challenge is of course getting through the month without stabbing something or dropping the hobby. Things that help me: 

- Paying for a class. I hate wasting money more than I hate whatever new hobby I'm trying, so I have incentive not to skip lessons. 

- CBT worksheets for negative or hyper competitive thought spirals. Identifying when you're having one and being able to break it is so so useful and leaves me feeling better about whatever it is I'm trying to do. Reminding myself that no one is perfect, and that sucking at something is the first step to being kind of good at something, and I should be kind to myself and others, is just a good life skill to have. You can find CBT worksheets online for free while you're waiting for your therapist. 

- Going with a buddy. A good friend can make loathsome tasks ok, and ok tasks great. They're also another source of accountability. If people aren't reaching out to you as much then reach out to them and be the one to make invitations. 

- Find things you like and then find tangential interests. You like writing, have you ever considered trying a tabletop game like Dungeons and Dragons with a focus on cooperative storytelling? I like to draw and recently I've been dabbling with animation for example. I suck at it, but my interest in character design helps bolster my interest in making those characters do silly dances. 

- Make sure you're getting enough sleep, enough sun, and enough of the relevant vitamins and minerals. These aren't a replacement for a good antidepressant/therapist, but they definitely can't hurt you and if you're looking for good stopgap measures they're up there at the top. "

&gt;That's all i was worth to them, a thing to keep beside them because there was a possibility of a relationship.

I mean you would probably know better than me but this sounds a bit harsh. I've had friendships where I developed feelings that weren't reciprocated and it can ruin the friendship. It doesn't mean I never considered them a friend, just that my feelings changed and you can't really take that back."
Considering all the people that contacted him including her parents my first thought was someone proposed to her and she said yes and now OP is flipping her world upside down. I know it sounds very Rom-Com but stranger things have happened.
"Haha no, it was a simple diamond necklace that matched her earrings.  Heart would have been corny.  "
"You say you depend on him, but You say that, but you can't depend on him. He's putting you into debt. You've gone hungry because of him. *He's not the breadwinner and you personally might be better off without him*.

Look for  some kind of vocational/training course, childcare certificate-- hell, floristry, or cooking, or anything. 

Also, make sure your birth control is not something he can tamper with."

"There are plenty of people who are depressed and who don't tear apart every life decision and loved one of their friends. Even if there's some way for y'all to bury the hatchet, you're right-- can't unring a bell. She's been thinking those things, and you both now know it.

I'm curious how she expected her tirade to go? That you'd just agree with her and comfort her and still be her maid of honor? Do you frequently rugsweep her outbursts like this? You seem thoughtful, caring, and sweet, OP. You deserve better than to be treated like this."
"Erm yeah sex is exercise unless your just laying still. Sex can be an amazing workout especially for your legs/core. 

Also you say here that you “don’t have all that active of a sex life unfortunately” that end part makes it sound like you would like more.

But then you go on to say “we’re fine with our sex life”. So which is it?

Either way I don’t understand how you can be in a relationship when you have basically nothing in common or share next to no interests. 

Anything can be made to feel like a date if the two of you love each other’s company.

I don’t really understand what advice you want when your refusing to do any exercise because you hate everything. 

Don’t want to eat healthier options when you go out. 

And are fine with the fact that other than a love of food you have nothing else to share with one another....doesn’t leave a lot does it.

Either eat out and save your daily calories for that one meal (which is what I do, I don’t gain weight if I do this no more than twice a week).

Make cooking healthy food at home more of a date together, wear something comfortable but date worthy, light candles, etc. 

Don’t eat your full plate, force yourself to have smaller portion sizes, eventually you get fuller quicker but it takes time. 

In the evening go get ice cream but walk there and back, talk while you walk/take pictures together /people watch etc. 

That’s all I can think of."
"This is the kind of behavior people are referring to when they say teenagers are petulant. You're a part of your dad's life and he wants to include you in things. This is a good thing. I would have killed to have a dad that gave shit about me enough to even care what I thought about who he was dating. One day you might date someone that you want one of your parents to meet, how gutted would you be if they had this reaction to it?
"
Try to get to a doctor/planned Parenthood as soon as possible. They can help. Don't go to a pregnancy crisis center.
"It’s really not, because either way you need to get to the bottom of it. She’s either asking you for permission because she’s into it, because she’s been conditioned to do so, or because she has some really strange ideas about how much control adults should be able to have over other adults and is about to start insinuating you should also be asking her permission for things. "

"You’re focusing on telling this girl and her well-being more than your own here

You need to leave like yesterday, he’s going to keep cheating on you because he can so go find someone who won’t "
I completely understand your perspective. It seems like theirs a lack of communication here in regards to their “dating” status and expectations.
"You ask if you were too frigid, and the answer for this guy is probably yes.  If you find someone less interested in sex then this wouldn’t be a problem, and there’s lots of men who are happy waiting.  This doesn’t make the guy immature at all.  Many adults date because they want to have sex.  That’s not a character flaw, it’s just different value system with different wants, needs and desires than you’re looking for."
"It's difficult to judge because a ""drink"" could really mean anything: the figure I've seen is that you lose about 10mL of alcohol per hour, which would be one shot in the UK (our shots are 25mL compared to the US' 37-44mL). By drink does she mean singles or doubles or strong beers or light beers or what-have-you? I think you'd have to try and judge it by their visible level of intoxication, but given people's apparent tolerances this could vary a lot too.

I think the danger with her telling them to stop and then phoning in a DUI is that it wouldn't necessarily take too long for her coworkers etc. connecting the events together and blaming her.

It's a tricky one, isn't it?"
"Agreed. I’d avoid the stress and drama of these toxic brothers. Forget them. Focus on your husband, kids, inlaws and friends. Build the life you want and you deserve. Leave this mess in your past."
I wish I had more than one upvote to give to get this somewhere near the top. Just talk to him. Tell him how you feel about him and the relationship and see what happens. And don't listen to the countless responses from people projecting their own baggage (and garbage) onto your situation. There are some great replies in this sub but they are often not easy to find.
"No! Don't do it!


I mean, you've wanted this trip for a long time. He hasn't. If he really wanted to go he could borrow the money somewhere else. 


50 months is 4 years! That's just not going to happen. "
"You can disagree if you want to, but it wouldn’t matter if you’d been best friends for 50 years if she’s going to have an irrational reaction. That’s just stubborn thinking. Sure, it *should* count but obviously it didn’t because she’s in hardcore, irrational denial."
"Holy shit I had no idea that was dangerous
 Overheating I guess."
"Bratty little brothers are bratty but sometimes do grow out of it. 

When he says something shitty to you, keep on pointing it out. Ask him why he's saying it. Point out to him that he's doing something you've alreday told him hurts your feelings and he would not like to be treated that way. Do your best to be unemotional about it, just point this stuff out calmly.

Let him know that even if he is better at x, he's being hurtful to you on purpose, which means he is not being a kind person. And people who aren't kind often end up alone. And then walk away from his bratty little butt."
I wouldn’t speak to either one of them again unless they came to me and lead off with a sincere apology (which I can’t say I’d take seriously considering they both got the money they wanted). 
"He's apologizing for hurting/grabbing/yelling at her, and is sorry that their ""harmless fun"" got a bit out of hand to the point that it's not so harmless and not so fun. She was having fun in a way they had both previously been okay with, and it led to a bad result. He had a completely understandably reaction to getting frightened, but reacted in an upsetting manner.

They have a history of scaring each other like this, and she didn't escalate things, so while he's the ""victim"" of her joke, it's not like she's in the wrong here either.

It's not about who owes who an apology, it's about starting a conversation about what happened, addressing the problem, and trying to make them both feel better about what happened.

Taking the high road can be awfully lonely, and often ends up in a location you'd rather not be."
"Thanks. So what should I do, actually this was maybe 5 months ago. I think it's a good example of his personality, I feel he lacks empathy.  I don't think he would ever see my pov if I talked to him about it."
Really he should have reflected on his last relationship before going into a new one but I would not be happy with that either if hes not in a good place then therapy is better than him going to a cabin with his ex when he don't know where his head is.
"I've expressed interest in having sex outdoors, in a place that isn't crowded of course. The fingering thing, no I haven't. But it's the way he describes it being with me dressed this way. He knows that I don't dress like that because I dislike it, I've told him this, so it feels like he's describing what he wants to do to somebody else rather than me, if that makes any sense at all!"
"Seconding this, OP. My mother essentially abandoned myself and my full siblings with my dad so she could do whatever she wanted, and as a result she seemed like the stabler option. Truth is she doesn't care that much. Stay with your dad."
"&gt; I did commit for a future with him

Rofl, no you didn't.  He proposed 3 years ago, and he has been fighting for your relationship ever since.  He has held the door open to your future together in the face of all your parents' efforts to shut it, but he can't force you to walk through.  You haven't committed to anything, ever."
Why should she take care of two children. Shit you are 28 years old. Its time to grow up and make better choices. And it sounds like because she did that now you are in college. So win win. 
"I will, thanks"
"I've heard a lot of great things about this organization, OP. It's a group of people in exactly the same situation as you."
it sounds like he doesn't even like her :( no passion in anything written about her. 
She's trying to be like herself. She wants theses things because it's her lifestyle choice. If you do not like her lifestyle choices that's an incompatiblity 
It sounds like therapy would basically be impossible due to his refusal to talk to anyone who disagrees with his beliefs. This is not a kid who is going to cooperate.
"I'm confused, this supports the idea that it's about the problems inherent to masculinity. Are you guys reading this wrong? You'd be hard pressed to find an analysis of the book that doesn't touch on this."
"I love this comment such a lot. Well-said, and a very interesting insight from your own experience too."
"Not even step-dad, adoptive father."
Sounds like borderline personality disorder to me. Speaking from experience. 
"&gt;  She gets crazy if she feels ignored by him, and may cause problems at work for him

You're already well past the point at which long talks are going to work. She is not thinking clearly if she believes your fiance is ""the only one who understands her""

He should inform the HR at work, block her on all social media and let her do her worst.

"1. Eminent domain, not imminent. Though eminent domain can be imminent, too.

2. They need to properly make an offer before they can claim it (most likely. Depends what state OP is in). OP having valued the land already means that if in 5 or whatever years they do try to acquire the land, then they're forced to pay that sum, if not more due to land viability increasing the cost. Additionally, eminent domain is only used to grant the land to use of the public (which OP's husband seems to want to do eventually, turning it into a wilderness area for the town.)

I think they'll be fine. Plus, the fact that they'll have money from the current lawsuit/buyout means that they can fight the state if it does happen, and not just be forced to fold like most people. The friction might cause some relationship issues though. I don't quite think I've ever seen a post so blatantly showcasing that OP thinks of herself and what the land means to her, instead of what it means to both of them as a team."
Don't waste another 13yrs with somebody that doesn't respect you. Just  let them be together (even if that doesn't work out) and move on. It's not worth it. Have some self respect. 
"Maybe. 

But there have been enough posts here in this sub that disagrees with what you’re theorizing. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if one day your gf is posting here because you do a combo or some of: sitting on each other’s laps, playing with each other’s hair, hand holding, hugs that last just a bit too long, sharing drinks, sharing a bed sometimes (that movie just played too late into the night) or walking around each other in your underwear or less. 

Some of these on their own are ok, but 2 or more and it paints a different picture. 

And the fact that I’m able to pull out a list like this for you to read should be indicative to you that:

a) siblings can cross a line
b) gf/bfs of said siblings **don’t** like it and come here to find a solution 

Just because someone hasn’t complained about it to you, doesn’t mean they’re happy about the situation. "
"He's manipulating you.  If he cared for you, your feelings would come first.  

&gt;All I'd like is an apology, and maybe a hug, but it seems he isn't capable of that.

He is.  He's an intelligent adult.  He just isn't doing it.  He's 30 with the emotional capacity of a young child.  If you're tired of it, leave, because he probably isn't going to change."
"She also lied about one of your sibs lives with dad. Courts don't take away custody from a parent just because they're poorer than the other parent - either she didn't fight at all/blew off court appearances, or the father was just as aware of what a flaming mess she is and was able to show that in court. "
"Don't condone this. When he is home for his headache help him to bed. Turn the light off, turn off his phone and promise to be a quiet as possible. If he is on the computer question it. ""Didn't you have a headache?"" Don't let staying home be fun. Take away any coffee if he drinks it since it could make the headaches worse. Refuse to spend time with him. If he pretends to be sick treat him like he is sick.

I do have chronic migraine attacks and people like him piss me off because they lead to people doubting me. It sounds like he is faking migraines and with a migraine (or other severe headaches) come other symptoms. Nausea. Neurological issues like difficulty to form sentences. Oversensitivity to light, sound and smells. 

After a bad migraine I feel shit for days! I take medications at least twice a day to keep it in check and the medications I take during an attack make me feel worse than the migraine itself, but for about an hour unlike the migraine that can last up to 72 hours.

His work ethic sucks and you should not condone it. You can make this less fun without a confrontation even though he deserves to hear how bad you find his behavior. Don't go out or get any take out when he has been home - because of the lost income . Bring up the money and your worries about them. And like I said before, don't let staying home be fun.

But I do think that QUESTIONING his headaches is not confrontational or accusing since he doesn't seem to suffer from them once he is home. Questions that.

"&gt; I got an STD

You're being unclear here. Did you get herpes? The same kind your boyfriend tested positive for? Or some other STD?

If it's herpes, then obviously you got it from him going down on you. If it's something else, something he *doesn't* have, then you should tell us what, and we might be able to make a better guess as to how you got it."
"I agree. His girlfriend is likely to know it wasn't written by him.  This may not be something she'll realize right away, but eventually she'll find out and she'll be crushed. Even if your brother doesn't write eloquently, it's the sentiment that counts. Ghostwriting a love note defeats the purpose. He might as well just google a cliched love poem."
"He lost his right to privacy when he cheated.

Honestly though, I'm not sure why married couples need privacy from each other on electronics. My husband and I know each other's login information for phones, email, and all social media accounts. I've never felt the need to look though because we have built trust with each other. I've used his pc or phone without needing to ask him though and he has on my devices. We're married. What could we possibly have to hide from each other that isn't inappropriate?"
"You're basically asking how to handle abuse better, because that is what he is doing, and if he refuses to go to therapy it is clear that he is not serious about treating you better. 

But, as long as you're hell bent on staying with a guy who does shit like this to you once a week, stop trying to work things out with him when he is having a fit. ""BF, this is getting out of control. I won't stand here and be screamed at. I am leaving, and we can talk when you've gotten yourself together."" And then disengage, every time.

"
"This is how I explained it to my husband... You may go to work and I may stay home, but I'm not sitting on my ass all day. I'm working too, unpaid work, caring for our infant son and taking care of the house. Especially when no one picks up after themselves, I'm doing double work. When he comes home and thinks he doesnt have to help with the baby that means he's working 8.5 hour days while I work every waking moment (16+ hours). So excuse me if I want you to feed him once or twice when you come home or I'd like to take a half day break. We both work, I just don't go anywhere or get paid.

He gets stressed out after 4 hours of caring for the baby... I remind him try it for 16 hours every day, 7 days a week. Yes, I NEED a break. "
She's been watching waayyyyyyyy to much Downton abby
"First of all it doesn't sound like they're friends. Sounds like OP's delusional or probably had a crush on this guy who barely noticed her.


This isn't even a joke. Who types like that. I'd probably leave them on read, but it's more likely that the guy doesn't even see OP as a friend.


That or the guys version of an April Fools joke is blocking OP, which is probably more funny then whatever this is."
"You should post this in r/JUSTNOMIL. A lot of them have experience with exactly this, but from the son/girlfriend perspective. "
"At no point in any of his thought process has there been the slightest bit of empathy for you.

He went from 'dirty dishes' to 'get mad', without 'my wife has been working hard looking after the kids so this is understandable'. He went from 'get mad' to 'throw away dishes' without circling back round to understanding you, without thinking 'ok I'm mad about this and we can have a talk about it but right now dishes need washing and my wife hasn't had time/energy', without even 'I'm mad and don't understand why my wife hasn't done the dishes but they need washing', without even 'I'm mad so I'm leaving them', but straight to 'throw away dishes'? With no pause for 'this is an abusive and scary move', no pause for 'this will upset my wife' or 'this will *particularly* upset my wife because there's an important cup in there'.

Or maybe there was pause for those last bits, and he either didn't care, or *wanted to make you feel scared and deeply upset* and calculated that.

And even now he has an opportunity to cycle back round and pick up on *any* of these elements of empathy for you and apologise, and he's not doing it.

TL;DR run, tbh. I wouldn't stay with someone with such complete lack of empathy for me."
"Gotcha, yea, I've definitely chickened out a few times before getting the courage to let them know. Also, one other question, do you have frequent outbreaks? Even on acyclovir mine are every few weeks and have been for months. :("
I mean there was just a post here from a guy asking if his adult gf showering with her adult sister was strange and it received a resounding no tons of girls do that so it might be totally platonic on her friends end.
"Now you stop it right now young man! Cut that out! Smarten up and grow up!
-Lol what stfu."
"Edit: fixed some spelling errors

She didn't really brush it off though. She still didn't allow her friend to do it, she just didn't make a scene. If she doesn't spend as much time with that friend or it reached a point she didn't want the company of a friend at all it would not be a big deal. It is a big deal if a SO does something that would cause her to not be around him. What you are calling a double standard is what I would call placing different values on the relationships. Her relationship with her boyfriend is of much higher value, which doesn't sound like a negative to me. Why would she tell a personal story and in depth reasoning to a friend? Those are the sorts of things reserved for people we are intimate with. I don't make a big deal out of things my friends do that annoy me. If necessary I tell them to stop or that it bothers me but I would simply stop spending time with them before I would even think of going in to personal history to change the behavior. Obviously I feel very differently about my husband. I would put in the effort needed to fix a negative situation between us. Your POV is valid. I'm not saying your wrong. If you feel that it is a double standard you aren't really incorrect. I feel like it is expected that a relationship with a SO would have higher standards than friends or acquaintances. OP's girlfriend might feel the same. maybe it would help them to talk about it calmly as he might feel the same way you do. I wish some comments didn't get downvoted to the point they aren't seen easily. I feel it would be helpful for OP to see your input and the reactions to it."
are you referring to a home shower though or a highschool locker room where all the showers are communal?
Thank you. I'm very grateful to have people I can talk to. I just wish I didn't have to be doing this. I want as clean a break as possible. I came here with nothing and I can start again.
I agree with this. Maybe OP can go to her mom's couch and they can just lay together on the couch instead of on OP's bed?

"So he pays all the utilities and you pay all the rent?

The red flags I see about this is that he moved to your city and into your home. But if he's paying his fair share, then maybe not.

As for the comment, I dont think I would be able to forgive my fiance if he said something like that. And I cant ever imagine saying something so hurtful to my fiance bc I love him so much."
"No he pays all the bills, I pay 100% of my money to my credit card debt l (he also helps with this too)."
"So just honestly, what did you expect/want his response to be when carrying you is clearly something that’s physically impossible? Not trying to be mean, I’m just genuinely curious what you thought the response would be."
"They're not in season yet, ya goof. Try again come early may and I think you'll have a better strawb experience"
Don’t you think that would be relevant to the OP? Why do we always have to pry out these sordid details in the comments?
"Yup. This is a ""choose a friendship or your actual relationship"" moment. Because I can be sure anyone who says ""I love him too - platonically"" is gonna change if you know that this guy is sitting there, pining for you. 

Him telling you is *so* completely disrespectful of your relationship. Did he expect you to dump your BF? Cheat on your BF? Did he just do this because he wanted to get it off his chest? It doesn't matter, he made a bad choice and put you in a shit position, seemingly for no gain for anyone. Tell your boyfriend and let his actions run their course."
"If you won't leave him, then nobody can help you.

If you can't see his situation and wonder why they still live together, and realise how fucked up it is, then nobody can help you. Why is he not shutting her down? Why is he not defending you? Why doesnt he MOVE OUT? 

Because he is fucking useless. And because he cares more about keeping his weird cozy little home unchanged than he does about you

He is literlly choosing her over you, daily, by the mere act of continuing to live with her"
"This is gonna be a long, long 10 years :-("
"It could be but 1,5 years seems like an awfully long time to not wise up. I’ve seen some pretty extreme examples of the opposite bring true; my own grandfather had a side chick for around two decades. My grandparents were married but mostly lived separately; he lived in a countryhouse he had inherited, she had some mobility issues so it made sense she lived in an appartment in the city where everything was closeby. They visited each other pretty often though. My grandmother died recently and only then it came out that he’d had a mistress since the 90s. She obviously knew what was up. Thing is, me and my family visited the countryhouse everytime we went to visit my grandparents and all these years, we never met her or saw any of her stuff there. So she had to leave her home and clear her stuff out everytime his “real” life interfered. I don’t know why she was willing to put up with this, especially for some 20 years, but apparently she was okay being the side piece, being kept a secret from the family and being the second priority whenever necessary. Go figure."
"Unfortunately, it's not your decision to make. If your parents are okay with him being there and don't care about the things he does or won't require him to pay rent... that's on them. I know it's annoying and it directly affects you, but you have no say since it's not your house, it's your parents. If you really can't live with it you'll have to move out. "
"After all this time, what's the point?  He will probably be upset that you've kept it from him all this time, but in reality it was a minor incident years ago.  the fact that you still feel guilty is proof that you'd never do something like that again, anyway.

besides, it was only a kiss

how'd it end up like this"
"I definitely agree with the two personal cars. Especially with their combined income. However, an old WRX is hardly a luxury vehicle haha."
"It's not anal that's the issue, it's that he knew she didn't want to do it and he pressured her into it anyway. Never mind the fact that he apparently was able to keep an erection when he KNEW his partner was NOT enjoying herself. He's gross as fuck and he used her like a sex doll. I would never be able to get near him again.

Honestly, the insane obsession some men have with anal comes entirely from porn, and it's fucking stupid. Anal is fine, if BOTH parties are into it, but 95% of men learn about sex through porn, and they're utter crap in bed because of it. "
"&gt; I hate to say it but it sounds like it’s time for an ultimatum.

It was time for an ultimatum 16 years ago. They've not been intimate for *three times* as many years as they spent having sex. An ultimatum is useless at this point, and would only serve to keep OP tethered in this marriage even longer. "
"If you decided to not combine finances, you shouldn’t have paid off his loans!!!!

He is a boy and he is being damn selfish, only thinking about implications of things to himself. Divorce his sorry ass."
"It's fine that you don't care he died. It's not fine that you don't care that she's hurting, and viciously said someone she cared about was asking for death. I agree that he was, but SAYING that to her was awful of you. You should apologize and consider couple's counseling to deal with the rage you obviously still hold inside over their 'emotional affair.' I get that flirting was wrong but my god, it was five years ago and the man is dead, do you really have to be so cruel to her? Grow up."
"Her paying for everything seems to be a caveat of this relationship. If you don't like it, just don't hang out with her. You're not obligated to spend time with someone who infantilizes you and makes you feel bad. It's really weird that you keep ending up in retail situations with someone who you're having this specific conflict with, though. If you still want to hang out with her, just do stuff that's free, like having tea in the park together or doing jigsaw puzzles or something. "
Really the problem isn't just that he's frugal. It's WHY. This guy has some serious baggage and trust issues surrounding dating. He doesn't trust himself and he doesn't trust you. If he deviates from his budget you're going to take advantage of him and once again he's going to be too dumb to notice. I assume that's how he sees dating. It sounds exhausting and demoralizing.
"She’s not going to have another kid so the counseling would be focused on grieving the loss of your child and accepting that your wife is not going to have another child. She did think about it already. She thought about it for a month. You shouldn’t keep asking. If it’s something you can’t be okay with, you should go to counseling and see if you can accept your family as it is with some professional help."
"It is also a way for him to say that he'd rather break up than completely change his behavior. I had an ex who would tell me to break up with him when we had problems. He was unwilling/unable to change what I needed him to change. 

Even if he knows on some level, the fact that he is comfortable doing things that terrify you is very troubling. "
"&gt; I think it is such a horrible thing to do, to leave someone just because they don't meet your needs sexually. 

I think your views of a romantic relationship are tainted somehow. Sex is at least like 25% of a relationship. Sex is like air, if you're getting plenty of good air, you don't think about it. But when the air is bad, or you can't get enough of it, it's all you can think about."
"I don't think she did. But the reality is she got what she wanted at every step of the way, and now she's openly admitting she loves her kid more. "
"Yup - he’ll try and stick her with half his school debt, then “forget” to pay child support (or will have a long sob story every time about how it’s just not possible for him to pay even though he reaaaallllly wants to).  "
The most logical explanation is that it's hers and she's trying to find a way to talk her way out of this. 
"No no, her sulking for 2 days in the hotel and saying a chance, 15 minute encounter with an ex ruined everything is **totally** adult"
"Yep if you say 'at least meet him' it's an easy out. 'i met him and didn't like him'. I'd have gone, you can meet your future son in law and father of your grandkids or you can meet the guy your daughter will elope with and father of the grandkids you will not get to play with. Your call. Also the hotel has good filter coffee."
"Another good point. I suppose I've spent so many years trying to keep things stable, I'm still doing that. And I shouldn't. "
It would be more convincing if you took ownership of your actions and acted remorseful. 
"I'm going to be judgemental for a sec- who would want to be friends with parent couples that do cocaine? They're *parents* with small children ffs. If I was OP I would reconsider my relationship with these people, because this isn't right."
"Then you have your answer. He hasn’t changed all that much, just enough to keep you around. "
"I understand wanting what's best for her and not wanting to see her struggle.  And I understand appreciating what she's done for you to help you.  But in the end, if you know you're not going to be satisfied with the relationship and your partner's aspirations, then the kind thing is to move on, for the both of you.  She will be fine.  She may struggle a bit, but if she needs to at that point, she'll get a job to make ends meet."
"Thank you. No reason to be polite here, OP, she is the rude one! I suggest your H tell her to cut it out but if he refuses, you are totally justified in having a talk with her yourself. She brought YOUR parents into this. "
"&gt; He needs an enforceable court order guaranteeing his time with his kids 

He probably already has this. Whether he does or doesn't, given the judgemental attitudes toward open relationships, his wife could easily find a sympathetic judge to get an enforceable court order taking away his custody and only giving him supervised visits."
"Kids run the gamut between calm and hyper, introspective to rambunctious. Those kids sound mostly normal. 

Yes, it sounds like their parents need to work on nipping the 'fair' thing in the bud, but siblings at that age are learning about how to handle what's theirs and what's others', and how to divide and share and work things out. There can be crying and whining involved until the kids learn to handle their emotions.

Here's the thing for you to consider: if you decide to take the risk and become a parent - you have to be in it for the long haul. 18+ years is a long time, and you can get all sorts of phases in there - crying toddlers, whiny kids, annoyed pre-teens, rebellious teens. Depending on your parenting and the kid's natural disposition, you could get a totally calm, sweet child, or you could get a neurotic fussbag, or a curious but talkative ball of energy. 

Are you willing to accept the possibilities? The good and the bad? The sick and the well? The quiet and the noisy? The loss of your total independence and freedom? 

If you're not, it's good to know that now.

"It's unfair that you say 'thinking with your dick'. It's 4 months in, they are both in their 30's and it doesn't seem like there are any religious or other reasons they aren't engaging in PIV. Unless there is some trauma in her past that she hasn't told him about, I think it's fair to ask for a timeline on when she thinks she'll be ready, and to be honest about wanting it. Wanting intimacy in a relationship is not 'thinking with your dick'"

"&gt;My best friend Nicole and I....

&gt;...of Rachael doing all this work

Got your names screwed up there sport. 

&gt;...that what she did was a big impulsive mistake.

OK, so on the off chance this isn't someone working on really bad speculative fiction, here's the thing:

Groping your wang while you were unconscious and not waking up could be a ""big impulsive mistake""... the *first time*... if you like, half-fell out of bed... and your pants fell down... and she needed to, I dunno, tuck your wang back in and didn't understand how the fly on men's pajamas work. Maybe. 

But every contact **after** that is not ""impulsive"". It's actually the **opposite** of ""impulsive"": it's planned, premeditated, considered and deliberate.

So this person waited until you were helpless and unable to consent. They took advantage of your history, and your *family's trust* to get you into a position where she could take advantage of you. That's horrible! She lied about how she felt, she lied to you about what she did, she obviously has been misleading and lying to your parents. 

I know at 17, love can be confusing and tricky, but love is **not** lying. Love is **not** her taking away your choice to say yes or no. 

It sucks that at 17 having sex seems really important, and yet here you are, having sexual contact but it's not the fun, good thing you wanted. That's really confusing and upsetting, and it's the kind of thing that you *can't* sort out on your own, because you've got no experience or perspective on it. You really do need to get some outside perspective and support, and that means telling your parents what happened, and maybe asking to speak to a therapist or counselor to talk through how love and sex and trust and consent all fit together. Not because you're bad or stupid, but because what happened here is so wrong and out of order and just not right that you can't untangle it on your own. 

Tell your parents. Ask to talk to a counselor a few times to sort all this out. "

"&gt;She blew her chance when she humiliated me in front of everyone she knows constantly for over a year.

If you are satisfied with your decision, then she did not ""humiliate"" you. Grow a spine and accept consequences for your actions. You can snivel winge about how in ""western culture a ring is expected"" all damn day. You *chose* to reject said cultural norm. You get to bear the consequences. Your wife clearly wanted said ring but I am sure also has been asked a thousand times over why she wasn't given one and reflexively offers said information as a result.

Your decision to withhold a ring now as punishment is symptomatic of a deeply disturbed and immature relationship dynamic. She is your *wife,* not a child you deny a cookie for failing to clean her room.

Your responses on this thread only further illustrate said relationship dynamic.

"Thank you! I just looked up Josh and Lolly Weed. That is a wonderful example - and very relevant.

I do wonder if she has the capability to leave him. She is SO religious. I'm not sure if her religion would ""let"" her leave him - regardless of how bad it got. She has ""given herself up to the lord"" and he has told her ""everything will be alright"". In addition she says she got ""married for the sanctity of marriage, not for love"".

That being said, you've also been with him for 9 years. It's OK to want to date other people and OK to decide that he's just not the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. It'll be more fair to both of you if you're just looking for an excuse to end things. Break-ups don't need to be agreements or have any big ""blow outs.""

2. He holds a lot of resentment in his mind about you and your fitness. He's kept it bottled up and this resentment has taken a strange and ugly shape in his head.  

I recommend talking to him about what he's feeling. Is there a part of him that hates you for your lifestyle? Is there a part of him that feels suffocated right now? Etc etc. Really understand what is going on in his head because no healthy happy person randomly bullies their spouse.  

Then work on a plan together to conquer that resentment. Whether it's couples therapy or exercising together etc. "

Date someome who can legally buy a beer...problem solved 
"""I know you don't see it as your fault"" 
It's not his fault. This is not hard to understand. It's not your responsibility to prevent other people from assaulting you. 
Taking preventative steps to protect yourself is a good idea, and it's worth talking about, but if you don't take those steps and you are assaulted you're still not responsible for being assaulted. 
Think of it this way, it's a good idea to have a home alarm system, it could save you from being burglarized. But if you don't have one, and someone breaks into your home, is it your fault? Should the police decide whether to prosecute the person who robbed you based on how well prepared you were to be robbed? 

""you had a choice""
Did he choose whether or not to have sex with the girl? If he did, then it wasn't rape. If he didn't, then it was rape, regardless of any of the other choices he made that day. 

""as long as you blame other people"" 
Blame means assigning responsibility for a fault or wrong - blaming the rapist is the only reasonable response. She consciously committed rape, she is the only person responsible for her own actions, therefore she deserves the blame. Blaming anyone else, or blaming no one, wouldn't make sense. 

""you'll always be the victim""
He is a victim of rape because he was raped, that's a fact and it's not dependent on whether he blames his rapist or himself or anyone else. Taking a drug doesn't negate the fact that if someone rapes you, you are a victim of rape. Again, this is not hard to understand, and these are not new ideas. The very foundation of essentially every legal system in the world depends on the premise that people are responsible for their own actions and not for the actions of everyone else. "
"I was born in Russia, but I've been in the states for almost 20 years so I don't usually have an accent. I personally don't mind people asking, but I do have friends who do. My recommendation is to ask more about the heritage. For example I have a weird last name that's obviously not American, so saying something like, ""Your last name is very pretty, where does it originate from?"" or like ""is your last name German?"" which would lead me to tell them it's Russian. And you could follow up with ""Oh, very cool! Is your family from there?"". Or if they or their family have an accent you could compliment it, and ask where it's from.

It generally depends on the person. If I had to stereotype the races that usually don't like being asked it's Asian &amp; Indian which I think is because they are most often fetishized for their race. But again, that's a crude stereotype, and it really is an individual preference. "

"I'm 22 and still sleep with my childhood teddy bear even though my boyfriend and I live together. It's honestly not that big of a deal... If my boyfriend wakes up before me and notices that the bear has been tossed to the floor he even picks it up and puts it back up next to me. Does your boyfriend wake you up in order to help him find his fabric thing? Because that's the only thing I could think of that would make the situation that annoying. After literal years having a routine or habit (like me sleeping with my teddy bear, or your boyfriend having this fabric thing) it's just a part of their life now. I think it's perfectly ok for adults to still enjoy the things they did when they were younger-adults still like Disney movies and I don't see why keeping their childhood safety blanket is really any different? Maybe your bf has undiagnosed (or diagnosed) sensory processing issues, or has had anxiety for a long time, or maybe ADD issues, there are various fidget toys that were designed for people with those issues to use that work just like it sounds like his fabric thing does. 

I didn't figure out that my 'weird' habits (like sleeping with a teddy bear, using the heaviest blankets possible, needing to repeatedly fidget with my zipper or obsessively rub soft things and being very sensitive to touch) are signs of anxiety and sensory processing disorders until my little brother was diagnosed with his own issues and my mom started researching things and I was already an adult at that point. I could probably go to a therapist of some sort and get medication to help , but honestly, I'm doing pretty good as a fully functioning adult without meds, I still have some issues but not enough for me to feel justified in taking meds. I had to be in another state for a month recently and wasn't able to sleep for more than 4 hours a night most nights because I just couldn't fall asleep without my bear or heavy blankets, but now that I'm back home and have the things I typically do, everything's fine. Why mess with a system that works pretty well? I still have problems with anxiety, but when I'm starting to have an anxiety/panic attack, I know how to calm myself down and what I need to do to help myself-heavy blankets, and something soft to touch. I've been like this ever since I was pretty much a baby, and growing up like that I already knew how to cope with it before I even knew it wasn't 'normal'. "

He wants you to dress up, he needs to help you facilitate (i.e. I second that he should be helping you purchase these clothes if he's so insistent that you wear them).

"Parents at that age are all about looking back and wistfully wishing they had “done it all differently “ and thinking they only have xx years left , put whatever they are fixed on, into high gear.

I recommend detached politeness, until they realize their heavy handed tactics are actually producing the opposite of their desire results.

Mom: “it’s unbelievable to your father and I that you have become this incredibly stubborn and selfish toddler that a simple visit to our church has turned you into a maniac who doesn’t love her parents “

You: “Mom, I love you and Dad, and wish this wedge wasn’t part of our relationship, but you insist on bullying me into your version of being a Christian. I am no longer 10 years old, and have decided I am not going to your church.”

Mom: “but why not? It’s a very simple request, and will only take 2 hours of your time, it’s inconceivable that you have dug in your heels this way, I am ver disappointed in you!”

You:”Mom, from what I understand of the Christian faith, your tactics go against what is acceptable. Please stop now, or I will leave/hang up/walk away. The answer again is no”

Mom:”you are an ungrateful horrible child.....

You walk away. No yelling, no commenting, no obvious answer. And give it 24 hours the first time, and then 36 hours and then 48 hours before you talk again. Eventually they will get the picture and stop it.

Usually the Christian converts last for 2-3 years before they relax.

Wait them out.

Ok? So? Maybe her life didn't require dress clothes before she met her boyfriend. She doesn't have to wear them to work obviously so maybe she didn't have a need for more than whatever she wore twice to those social events. If he EXPECTS her to change that then he should pay for it since she obviously had no need for it before he came along. She also explained that she can dress up when she needs to but doesn't see why getting drinks after work should require fancy clothes. I know i sure as hell don't dress up to grab a few drinks at a bar. If he wants that level of dress he should pay for it.

"I had something similar happen to me once. My flatmate had a group of friends visiting from out of town one weekend and asked if it was cool if they stayed at our place. One of them walked into my room in the middle of the night.

My boyfriend at the time actually woke up first and it was him shouting at them to get out that woke me up. The friend was clearly just drunk and had made a mistake (my door is directly next to my flatmate's) and he disappeared pretty sharpish. I remember the adrenaline and being super annoyed-I couldn't get back to sleep for at least an hour afterwards. I get where you're coming from 100%.

However, in the morning, said friend was so embarrassed and upset at what he'd done that he made sure to be out of the house before I woke up. He apologised profusely (through my flatmate, who was also mortified and apologising) and actually sent me flowers to make up for it. The fact he owned it, and apologised so sincerely, meant I could get over it. Honest mistakes happen, and as much as it was an invasion of privacy, it became no harm no foul for me and never caused issues between my flatmate and I.
 
About a year later, the same group came to visit my flatmate and I told him I was cool if they wanted to stay again, no grudge was held. They chose to get an Air Bnb to avoid the same thing happening, which I appreciated greatly even though I didn't feel it was necessary. 

So what I'm saying here is, you're completely right to be as upset as you are. It is truly terrifying when it happens, as you're asleep, naked and vulnerable. I felt all those thing too. 
What needs to happen for it to start to be ok is for the cousin who did it to own it (this doesn't admit meaning malice, they were probably just lost) and apologise, as well as both things coming from your flatmate as they are responsible for their guests. 

It sounds like what has happened, with them denying it and the other flatmate complaining about the noise YOU made, has made you feel invalidated. It's this you need to address. If they can appreciate these things when they're sober and then also take responsibility the noise you made that disturbed the other flatmate, then you can all begin to move on. 

It's then up to you how you feel about guests staying over in the future, as you still don't need to be ok with that even if this all gets straightened out. "
"This is one of the most insane posts I've read on here. At the age of 20, they barely know THEMSELVES let alone each other (I say this as a 21 y/o... we've all got some growing up to do). This is whack."
"I think you're maybe putting too much focus on forming close, deep friendships that all of us seemed to have when we were younger. Not saying you can't have that or shouldn't want that, but not every friend you meet has to be your closest best friend, ya know? Sometimes it's just nice to have someone to grab a beer with once a month or whatever. I think it would take the pressure off of your friend you're fighting with a little bit and would make you feel better."
"He's shown you where his priorities are. Your expectations of, 'Hang out with me sometimes, maybe prioritize me a little' are not unreasonable AT ALL. You have your own apartment and your own space, so it should be easy to make a clean break financially/physically. 

Focus on school and dance. Now you have more time for dance! Now you can meet new people in your new town. "
You are her sugar daddy and she wants to upgrade to a more generous model
"To me, this would be absolutely unforgiveable. He absolutely does not respect your wishes - he's escalating how personal the information he's sharing about you is. I would leave if I were you."
"No. You didn’t just cheat, you tried to run away. You got caught, and things will never be the same, and that’s completely your fault. If your wife is smart, she’ll be done with you. "
"She says ""us"" when she talks about his parents coming to visit. I wonder if his parents are covering his entire ticket, so he has no opinion..."
"You are not respecting your wife and her feelings right now. It's obvious who should be prioritized here and it's not the people who actively and intentionally bring stress and anxiety into your life. You may have the same blood but that doesn't mean anything if they refuse to act like family. Also OP, why not just tell them to fuck off when they're being rude to you next time ?"
"I think it’s difficult without the context of this conversation. She may have expressed she was worried about the side effects and he had then said this. It may have come from a supportive rather than a restrictive place.

I’m more baffled that she had to show him condoms because he didn’t think they needed them."
"Why is this post made every other month? Same story,  I mean word for word same, just different people. Last time it was the gf that posted, now its the bf. And it all happened ""two nights ago on his birthday"". I mean we all want that sweet, sweet karma but come one


**Edit** And now the post is completely different .... nice mate, very nice

**Edit** lol, whats going on here"
"&gt; I was the one who introduced him to condoms because at first he didn't think it was necessary.

Ehh what did I just read? 

&gt; I told him about BC pills to further lessen the chance of myself getting pregnant, and he didn't want me to take it because of the side effects. We also talked about the shot, and he decided he didn't like the idea of it as well. 

Who cares what *he* wants when it comes to *your* body and *your* protection? You're being responsible (unlike him) so just get any kind of birth control you like, he has no say in that. And even then your partner should still wear condoms if you're really not ready for a child (and, of course, as STD prevention).

But honestly, you probably should stop having sex with this immature guy altogether, sounds like nothing good can come out of it."
"I’d bring it up to your boyfriend, but I think it would be incredibly rude to bring it up to his parents. 

Ps. A standing airplane is a horrible idea, and you shouldn’t bash other people for the way they choose to travel. "
"Here to point out, her ""screaming and doesn't listen"". It is because the choice is so obvious but you can't see it for some reason. 

A decade worth of holiday with your family, one Easter with her family of choice. Really a no brainer here. We all see it, except for you. 

EDIT: it's like explaining to someone 1+1=2. But they insist that it might equals to 3 or possibly 2.5 Really frustrating. "
I don't think he was looking for the bathroom. He tried to *come back in* immediately after being kicked out.
[deleted]
Tell him you feel you can trust him more if he can respect your boundaries. 
"&gt; (which made my vagina retract into my stomach lol)

LOL  This must be the female version of a guy feeling like his balls just retracted.

As to the rest, well, it's pretty much for sure you aren't going to like it if you feel like you've been badgered into it.  At that point, he could have the oral skills of a 20 year veteran lesbian porn star and it's not going to get through the resentment of the pressure he used.

And yeah, the whole ""It will help us trust each other"" is pure manipulation to get what he wants.  If it were me, that line alone would be enough to get him the boot.  

 
*Though I'm admittedly a rabid hater of emotional manipulation.  I even got a little angry when my son would try the wheedle voice as a kid.*"
"He's not going to change.  Douche Baggery is a lifelong trait once you make it past about 20.

What he will do, is make you feel awful until you fit his idea of acceptable.  Then he will be sweet and kind and get you to marry him.  Then you will get pregnant once or more and when your body doesn't bounce back immediately after giving birth, he'll start sleeping around and justify it by blaming you for ""letting yourself go"".

Then eventually, after years of emotional abuse, your kids will be grown or mostly grown and you will have become fed up with his BS and he'll divorce you to go be with a 24 year old physical therapist who is young enough to still be easy to manipulate."
If I were in his shoes I would be working fast food/retail/etc and applying like crazy in all of my free time. Waiting for something at the level he was making is a tremendous luxury that they cannot afford right now.
This exact thing happened to me a couple days ago this whole post by OP is giving me deja vu. Been friends with her for a year and then hooked up with a girl she introduced me to and she got jealous somehow and realized she actually had feelings for me. It can happen i guess 
"Wanted to add: another approach you can take is to ask your boyfriend what it is he wants you to DO. Probably what will happen is your boyfriend's Feelings will tell him ""Leave your job! Move 3000 miles away where Brian is not in our lives! Rawr!"" but his brain will recognize that these things are entirely untenable. If he tries to say that the current status quo (you dropping everything to verbally pledge your love on a regular basis, and having him basically accuse you of lying) is what he wants, you tell him that that solution doesn't work for you (because being accused of lying about fundamental aspects of your relationship by the person you love is really fucking hurtful and you can't live that way).

Possibly your BF thinks these recurring spats are not actually as corrosive and terrible as they actually are."
"If you really want to continue to see them (not sure why you would) play their game. It sounds like they have only been in a relationship for about a year so get a little petty with it. Throw a few ""you will understand once the relationship hits 5 years"" or if they say your not right for each other say ""when you've been together as long as we have you just know. 

Honestly they sound miserable and are just picking on you because their relationship sucks. Don't get mad (that's what they are looking for) just through a little petty shade their way."
Don't minimize drinking and driving...it's not a simple problem.  She already knew the consequences when she did it last time.  It's on you if you uphold them or not.
"&gt;We've had a couple of times when they came very close to cutting us out, and each time devastated my wife. **She really values them**

Why? Honestly you need to disabuse her of her current picture of them. Tell her how nasty they are behind her back."
Gross. I'd keep your toothbrush and other similar items in your room for the time being. 
Is it possible your brother is suffering from depression? Lack of attention to hygiene is pretty common.
Maybe your wife is sick of watching her husband be made the butt of everyone else’s horrible “jokes”? And since you won’t tell them to knock it off she’s putting her foot down. 
"I think he's insecure cause he's 26 almost 27 and going to school with a bunch of 20 yr olds. He's a gym rat and its getting harder for him to keep up. Hes excited about the baby and already has a daughter so I doubt that my pregnancy is the issue but, I mean anything is possible.  

And yeah I mean if he harasses me like this continuously I would absolutely leave him. I just think with it being so sudden and new that just breaking it off without trying to resolve it would be wrong. I also suspect he may be bi polar and that perhaps the stress is triggering him? 

either way he's going to have to communicate with me about it all when I bring it up tomorrow night. "
Right? I actually laughed out loud. Literally fucking impossible. No wonder everyone is annoyed with that bullshit.
"Jesus no, don't show her this. It will be in no way useful. Let her go and begin to move on from you instead of still leading her on when you want to be with others. "
"Uh, just call him? If he's your boyfriend for FIVE years why are you so afraid to just call him and ask what's up? Use your words. ""Hey babe, it feels weird when you don't text to check in like once a day. Can you please do that for me? Thanks!"" "
"I couldn’t have said this better myself. This is the exact sentence I would use. It’s succinct. And leaves her no room for discussion. 

The girl has failed at several jobs. It’s now on her to get her shit together and no one can do it but her. "
"Maybe take it to the bathroom, but otherwise she needs to get past it. People have different sex drives. You shouldn’t go without because she doesn’t want to, and you seem satisfied to handle it yourself. That’s pretty good on you, not pressuring her, willing to have sex with her if she wants to, or you handle it. Just maybe try the bathroom or living room if she’s in bed. But she needs to accept that you have a higher sex drive. Let her know you’ll compromise and not do it in her presence but you are allowed to have that release if you want it. "

"&gt;she was asking my husband about his pornography habits

What the actual fuck?"
"I fully agree. OP made the right choice. 

It's a shame his ex, her friends and parents are trying to shame him for making a mature decision to end it due to incompatibility."
"The only person who gets to decide if it's ""too soon"" is you.

The benefit of breaking up means you don't have to consider that person's feelings when you choose to do things for yourself."
"If someone sent me a pic of myself before I knew them, it would creep me out for sure. I understand that people creep other people on social media, but I feel it is different to assume someone will do something and actually know that they did it. Maybe that is just me but I can totally understand where your friend is coming from. My recommendation would be to apologize and learn from this. It is definitely outside of the social norm."
"""then she unzipped my pants and I thought maybe she just wanted me to be more comfortable. Then she took off her clothes and I thought, maybe she was just hot. Then she climbed in my lap, I thought maybe she could see the TV better from there"". Face palm.  "
Maybe you can start a regular FaceTime date with your mom.
"So you're a successful muscle man with a gorgeous wife, a sweet job, and soon to be two kids. I'm picking up the definite smell of sour grapes.

Also, don't be scared of BDSM if it's something you want to explore. Done properly it is perfectly safe even if you are Vin Disel and she is made of glass. Do a bit of research and see if it's for you."
"Of course not, because then there's no chance of it happening again. If he said ""Wow that was inappropriate!"" you'd never give him another chance. Instead he showers you with compliments, and that he wasn't trying to ""upset"" you (downplaying what he did). He had wanted to do this for a long time, he just seized on this opportunity. People don't just randomly decide they want to bang their DAUGHTER'S FRIENDS! He knows it was inappropriate, but he doesn't care."
Sounds like the daughter is not the only person calling this man daddy when you aren't around.
"I know this is a difficult reality to face and not but you want to be dealing with, but you honestly need to wake the hell up.

Dude - **this guy is trying to solicit children**. You understand the severity of that right? Does not matter if he was successful or not, *he was trying*.

Imagine if you had found him having a conversation with someone he was trying to hired to murder someone else. And the conversation was about as brief as the one you typed out, but the message was as clear.

What would you do? Would you say ""Well he didn't actually hire a guy to kill some one so we can let this slide?"" or would you think ""Holy shit this dude is trying to kill someone the police need to be involved.""

I sincerely hope the answer is #2. You need to realize that this man is **a danger to children**. Period. He may have been in hiding, but his true self is revealed. Currently the only people who know about this are you and him. So if you say nothing, and he successfully preys on another child, **you will have had a role in it**.

&gt;So... I'm not sure I witnessed a crime, per say.

What else could you possibly interpret his statements as?

Wake the hell up OP. This is serious"
I think this is a great comment... I don't really believe the bf tbh
"This is very true. Even if your browser and search history have been completely wiped out, they can definitely still find it."
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed this.

Don't meet up with her. It will achieve nothing.

As for the guy, he's a creepy predator. Don't talk to him again."
I'm 21 and have to remind my parents that I'm an adult who is capable of waking up in the mornings on my own regardless of what time I go to bed. My mom still tells me when to go to bed and that I shouldn't be drinking alcohol with dinner because she doesn't like it. Definitely not a fan of going home.
"oh jesus, it's a sexual assault baby and she kept it.

oh god, this gets worse and worse and worse

she's so fucked if she stays with him"
"If the two of you are happy, it doesn’t matter. Defend your wife. They can fuck off. There is nothing wrong with being a house Wife, especially if you have children."
It's one thing for a single mother to be dating and maybe bring home a man once in while (sometimes people need to get laid and there can be complicated circumstances.. lol). But it's another to be running what sounds like a freaking trap house...
"You may see your father as more of a buddy than a parent, but he is your parent. He's the person who raised you, he was there for your entire life. He is the person who dealt with every issue you've faced for your entire life. Forget buying you nice things, that's really not what matters - he picked you up when you fell down, he cared for you when you were sick, he's done everything that's made you the person you are today.

You did miss out on a childhood relationship with your mother, because she left you. Going to live with her now is not going to make up for that. I don't mean that in a mean way, it's just literally impossible to rewrite what already happened.

I think you are making a huge jump here by thinking you want to go live with your mom. I also have to tell you, your father will be INCREDIBLY HURT to hear that you are thinking of living with your mom instead of your dad. I also have to tell you - *it is extremely irresponsible of your mother to discuss you living with her, without your father being aware and involved in the conversation*. It's irresponsible to get your hopes up like that and to cut him out of a huge decision like this. Maybe you just didn't mention it, but her first move when you brought this up should have been saying, *""hold up, your father needs to be a part of this decision, and it's not that I don't want you to live with me, but he's your parent and we won't discuss this until he and I are on the same page""*. He is your primary caretaker. He knows you, far better than your mother knows you right now. Again, that's not being mean to your mother, it's simply the reality of your relationship with your father.

You also underestimate how difficult it can be to move to a new city, new school system, leave all of your friends and start over. Your daily life will not be spent with your mother and sister, you will primarily be involved in your school. You won't get fun vacation time family, you will be dealing with your mother and stepfather in day-to-day parent mode. You are an only child, so you have no idea what being the oldest sibling is like, or what it's like to split your parent's attention with another child. Your sister will likely be their primary concern, because she's younger and needs more help and attention.

You have *no* idea what your father has gone through to be a stable single parent for you. You can't know, until you live on your own and realize how much work it is just to be an adult, and even then you won't get the full picture unless you have children of your own. You really need to think about this decision more. You are really jumping ahead of yourself - you also have no idea what the world was like before internet communication. You have so many ways to keep in touch with your mother on a daily basis. That is what you should be doing right now if you want to feel close to her. You can text her at any time, call or video chat with her daily, and build a relationship this way. You can tell her about your life and ask her questions that you don't feel you can ask your father in this way. Not living with her does not mean no relationship or communication."
"&gt; we love each other and negotiate very well

Real compatibility is being able to communicate well and navigate your problems together.  "
"He probably just isn't keen. Maybe you didn't ruin anything because there was nothing there to begin with!

Please don't stress, because being forward is something you should be doing. Fucking 10/10 for not playing games and just going for what you want. Hopefully the next dude loves it!"
This is true and I know you mean well but anyone who's reading this should know that no matter how old you are you can still have a full life if you want/need to leave your partner
Just an FYI the man your mom remarried is 11 years older than your mom. That would be like your dad dating an 18 year old. I think you are giving your dad too little credit here and your mom too much. 
"I would be cautious on assuming it's not serious. I'm just speaking from my own experiences, but I was the super duper high achiever in high school, and when I hit college, I just fell apart. That was eight years ago, and I'm only now feeling like I'm totally back on my two feet (and going to a top law school with a full ride!!!). It wasn't because college was hard-- it was actually easier than my high school. It was because I was isolated.

Does he live at home with you? If not, is he isolated? What does he spend his time doing, if not studying? Are his poor grades due to partying or are they due to avoidance? If he's lying to you during the semester, it sounds like he's got some shame. That might be something to talk to him about in an empathetic manner, as opposed to scolding way."
"Also, this is assuming you're not changing the characters - Metal Gear is a story with a lot of compelling material about sex. Everything is highly tragic and emotionally charged, love and violence are deeply intertwined, and there's loads of heavily objectified hot men in tight suits. You might do well to have a chat with her about what about MGS, and which scenes in it, she finds so attractive, and maybe discuss trying out some new things based on what you hear. Maybe she just likes having the emotional permission to lust after the male body. Maybe the heightened melodrama is a turn-on, and you should be looking at music and mood lighting (maybe don't quote speeches about being the lightning through that rain...). Maybe she just really likes the idea of repeatedly tying men up and torturing them until they push the Select button. You really don't know. She wants to share her fantasies with you, so listen to them."
"&gt;I worry a lot about how valid my feelings are on this topic

Another internet stranger saying I think your feelings are completely valid.

That said, I will also suggest that perhaps you could consider that you deserve a relationship with someone who doesn't string you along this way. There's something really off in what he's doing, to my eyes. The way he phrased the marriage thing after living with you for a year. The fact that he wants you to give the baby his last name but not marry you. Something isn't on the up and up here with this person, IMO. "
"Yes actually. Honestly, living together carries a lot of the risks of marriage with no legal framework for what happens when you break up. So that piece of paper is pretty important.

I don’t think your boyfriend is going to marry you. He doesn’t want to. He doesn’t think you are the right person. Feel that in your bones.

You are going to coparent with him but he doesn’t want to marry you. You really do have to accept that.
"
"&gt;I would say that your fiance can express concerns about ACTUAL HEALTH CHANGES (you seem out of breath a lot lately/you've been having persistent migraines/you've gone up two clothing sizes in as many months), but he can't try to control behavior. 

This is good, and I'd add that any conversation like this must, at some point **before** actions are taken, include a third-party, trained professional. If his concerns are medical, that means talking to a doctor. If his concerns are about fitness, that means a personal trainer. If his concerns are about nutrition, that's a nutritionist. If his concerns are about discipline or habits, that's a therapist. But **any** conversation like this shouldn't be ""you versus him"" but rather ""team you, with expert input"". "
"You need a new place and a new boyfriend. He'd rather steal from you than spend his own money. Think about that. So he's got no friends - that is 100% on him because if he does this to you, he for damn sure treats his friends the same.

Stop settling and accepting bad behavior.

&gt;He said if we split up and I moved out he would give me the money to buy a new one. 

Yeah you're never gonna see that money."
I don't think I would want a man to watch. If I did he wouldn't be a man close to my heart 
"You’ve got much bigger problems than the one you led with, then. "
"I read this whole mess and the only thing that stood out was that you got your son's hopes up and then cancelled on him. 
**STOP MESSING YOUR CHILD AROUND BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND. 
DON'T DATE SOMEONE YOU'VE BROKEN UP WITH 10 TIMES IN 12 MONTHS.**"
"She lied about the affair. You are realizing that she has been lying to you since it happened, because if you knew the truth, you would have acted differently. You are upset because she stole two years of your life by lying to you. 

Of course you want a divorce.

But sleep on it and make a decision that you know isn't simply emotional. Make the best choice. I don't disagree with the decision to divorce, but doing it for the right reasons makes all the difference. I don't see how you can trust a thing she says though."
"Thats the thing I do not understand. I was NEVER skinny in my life, and he says his ideal women's body shape is the one with FLAT stomach which also I never had as well. The only reason why I am not using that method you said is simply because I don't want to be the same person as he is. I am not sure he can actually gain 50lbs if I ask him so, but him &amp; his whole family is outlook oriented and outlook matters to them. I am pretty sure he will be okay with gaining more muscle from where he at right now."
"He also doesn't see ""complications"" in being a jerk to a coworker just because she's a pretty woman."
"She wanted you to either come begging her to get back with her, this confirming how great she is, or she wanted to have you moping that all these guys wanted to date her, so yeah it’s a power move.


Since things didn’t work out how she pictured them, she’s throwing a tantrum. Just ignore it and realize you dodged a really shitty, manipulative bullet "
"Ok from what you've written, it appears your brother is just lonely. It's plain loneliness, not incest. Try and push him to make his own friends whether it be a new hobby, or extra classes ... And listen to him, loneliness leads to anxiety and depression but please don't turn innocent clingy behavior into something its not."
She is abusing you. Time to stop thinking of her as your best friend. This is not going to get better. 
"People thinking it's not real is a thing. 

I have a massive food allergy that my parents did not believe was true. I had a reaction as a child to shrimp once, my Aunt is extremely allergic to shellfish, so I've just always stayed far away. They didn't think my reaction as a child was that bad or warranted any attention. I don't even remember it, but I remember enough to stay away.

Fast forward to my teens, we went out to eat at a nicer restaurant and they said, ""I don't know why you're so determined to avoid shellfish, people DO grow out of it."" So I ate a shrimp. And that shit was GOOD. So I had another. And then my throat closed, my lips blew up, I started feeling funny all over... And they could literally care less. They were like ""you're fine, just breathe."" I was like ""I CAN'T"" and I had no idea what to do. The fucking restaurant had to tell me to get Benadryl at a Walgreens in the same lot. I was in a panic. I threw up in the way - I could barely breathe, I didn't know what to do. I told the pharmacist what happened, they had me take 2 Benadryl and wanted me to stay but I left because I threw up again. And adult me knows I threw up the pills I just took, but back then I didn't think about it. 

Back at dinner my parents were just laughing and having a gas. I was like I HAVE TO GO, NOW. They were just like, ""no, were not done yet."" I spent most of the time in the lobby bathroom vomiting though my tiny throat and my parents thought I was ""doing this for attention."" Jokes on them, I vomited a shellfish-y bomb in their car. Then I specifically ran to their bathroom and vomited the rest, and I made my mom come in and watch to show this was not a drill. She just sighed. 

Still after that episode, to this DAY, they think I could eat shellfish and be fine. 

**TL;DR:** THE LENGTH OF IGNORANCE STUBBORN PEOPLE WILL GO WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S ALLERGIES IS ENDLESS. They will never, ever be convinced it's real, even when it's right in front of them. "
Are you sure your dad killed himself? Maybe I watch too much Forensic Files but it seems suspicious that he changed his will and then offed himself ... and has a “keeper” who didn’t “keep” him safe.
"Obviously, why would you feel like having sex with someone who treats you like this? This is some serious abuse, do you realise that choking is the number one predictor of an abusive partner eventually killing you? "
"&gt; She just wants to take it slow! Your post is sexist bullshit

I'm not usually slow to call reddit on sexism, it's everywhere on this site. But this isn't one of them. She has every right in the world to want to take it slow, and every right in the world to not want to start a sexual relationship with him yet. But that doesn't mean he's being unreasonable in wanting a sexual relationship with a romantic partner. Based on HER side of the story, which is obviously going to tilt her direction, she's been distant and somewhat dis-interested in a physical sexual relationship with him. That's fine. But it's also fine for him to decide that he wasn't getting what he wanted out of the relationship and move on.

If anything is sexist, it's you. You assuming that she gets to define the relationship for both of them and he has to accept it. He wasn't disrespectful, he wasn't aggressive, he simply distanced himself from a disappointing relationship and is obviously no longer interested in pursuing it anymore.
"
"No sure absolutely.  Because why should you care about the people your parents care about.  They should only care about you and your likes and your interests. You aren't required to return that care and interest.   Relationships are one-directional like that.   Love and family isn't a two way street, love only goes in one direction, from them to you, and not in the reverse.   
"
"Congratulations on planning and saving to achieve a long term goal.  That's a pretty big achievement at your age.

"What a selfish, self-serving load of hooey your BF would like you to accept. Don't do it.

Reminds me of an ex of mine who would constantly cry poverty at every outing, so I would pay for him so he wouldn't miss out. When we broke up I found he had thousands in the bank. People who want to use you make shitty partners."
"Let him have his fake girlfriend, why do you all care so much? He's not only a freshman but also a transfer, he's probably having a hard time. Going so far as to contract people from his old school just makes you guys sound nuts.

"Op got nexted. Can't say I blame the guy, why put in effort if the girl won't reciprocate."

"Dude, it sounds like she's busy and has a life outside of going on a date with you. You're overreacting."
"Again, your girlfriend deserves much better. Not everyone is looking to “upgrade” based on a point system they run. Your girlfriend really needs to get out before you find a 9/10 who mistakenly gives you a chance.

Two months in, if I met someone I connected with better, or if I wasn’t into my person, I realistically might end things. But I wouldn’t sleep with random celebrity because they out ranked my boyfriend by 2 imaginary hotness points. "

You didn't screw up one weekend.  You screwed up 14 years of her life.  You are not the victim in this."
yes! My mom helped me when I was struggling with intrusive thoughts by telling me to imagine a happy instance in my life as detailed as possible. This can help push out the intrusive thought. I would think about playing in a field with my dog in the summer. Worked great for me.
"Yep. My lifelong best friend would ask me to meet her for dinner (her house was on my way home from work) and I would immediately feel stressed like I couldn't breathe because I knew if I texted my ex and told him I was meeting her, he'd have a fit. No matter if he had plans or was at work or if I'd spent the previous 5 days with him, if I spent any amount of time with anybody else, I was an asshole who didn't care about him at all and just wanted to party with my friends (who I almost never saw). I remember crying on my birthday because I would be so stressed knowing there would be a fight later if I invited my friends to hang out with us (he would get mad if my friends went out with us because he'd accuse me of ignoring him to talk to them).

He would even throw fits when I hung out with my mom and sister. Fun times. :( I think he wanted to isolate me because he figured if I had nobody else, I would never leave him (super unhealthy) and so he could treat me like crap and I'd have nobody to tell me it wasn't normal."
Why doesnt she bring her boyfriend and your boyfriend brings you? This is too strange personally 
"Nope, he didn't. But, if he hadn't moved here in the fall, we probably would have broken up. LDR was too hard after 3+ years. I think he was kinda stuck between a rock and hard place. I dunno."
"&gt;  my other colleague [30F] is very empathetic and if she thinks we are going to do this and ruin 22Fs degree then she gets upset

Red-direct her bad feelings to the fact that a poor attitude and bad work ethic are not things that can support a degree, and that no one is responsible for anyone else's failures to be employable.

People have to face consequences for their actions, and while it's admirable to be empathetic, without actual application or action empathy is a chumps game. Active empathy would have been attempting to mentor the young woman, but it sounds like she's too arrogant to take a mentor seriously.

Help your empathetic coworker to see where the fault-lines lie."
"If you're going to use this site for a creative writing exercise, try not to plagiarize lol"
"&gt;What got me mad is not that she doesn't like me or I spent over $100 on dinner. But why did sit for 5 hours having a convo when I asked her politely a few times if she had to go. I don't want to sit with someone and talk about myself like that whose being fake nice.

I kind of hope she doesn't actually talk to you again.

But no, unfortunately, it does sound like she's still interested but can't right now, which she explained to you ahead of time. Jeez. "
"Regardless of what event is the right or wrong one to go to, your wife obviously doesn't truly love you or want to be with you if she's saying 'not to expect her when you get back'."
"This is VERY important information and she should put it it above. Everyone is defending her and I agree that her husband did not need to be so abrasive and cruel with his statements. But if you lose your kids due to ""work ethic,"" something more is clearly wrong."
This makes her husband sound like a selfish twit. 
"How much did you talk about Courtney with him? Because if you talked about her and he held his tongue when it would have changed things, then yeah I think he would be loyal to a fault. But I'm guessing you didn't talk to him about her, for the same reasons he didn't with you?"
Glad you're seriously considering your father's feelings. He loves you more than you know. 
So you just .....haven't been to the bathroom in 3 days?
"This is very true. 

I've always struggled with my weight (even when I was quite thin and athletic). I know ""calories in, calories out"" like the back of my hand. BUT... that doesn't tell you *why* you get so hungry you feel like you're *dying* after not eating for 3 hours. It doesn't tell you how to make it bearable to live with an eating plan that results in weight loss. 

There's so much more to actually executing it than just calories in, calories out. That's the fundamental rule behind it, sure, and it's never going away, but it's so obvious that it's useless when it comes to actually executing a plan. I had to learn which foods triggered that intensely painful, all-consuming, insane hunger drive. If I avoid them I literally never feel that type of pain, ever, even if I don't eat for 20 hours straight. Losing weight doesn't have to be hard or miserable but if you just yell ""calories in calories out!!!"" and refuse to discuss any of the multitude of other factors that make it a million times easier to actually do, you're just setting people up to fail. 

By addressing things like leveraging habits and rote behavior and making the weight-loss-conducive choice the *easy* choice in my home environment, I've been able to lose slowly but steadily without putting much conscious effort into it. And that's by looking at things that aren't intuitively related to CICO (even if they eventually result in a painless, thoughtless calorie deficit) and directly working with my genetics and health conditions (PCOS). "
"Good grief - you were bossy and demanding and clearly encroached on his pre-established boundaries. It doesn’t matter how you or your friend think he should spend his money. If he doesn’t want to waste money, in his mind, on luxury transportation that is his call. Not yours. Your friend is choosing to date him knowing he is frugal. That is her call. 


If I was him I would have been furious or at the very least annoyed you wouldn’t shut the fuck up about the rideshare. "
"Hi, I am a 911 dispatcher. This is something that you should always report the moment you see it happening. **There is no such thing as a justified beating.** You do not need to know or understand the motivation behind the violence to try to stop it.

First and foremost, police exist to maintain order and protect life. All else is secondary. If and when you see violence, you should call 911. Also, most police departments (or sheriff's offices) have non-emergent police phone numbers. If you are too intimidated to call 911, then find the non-emergency number. In our department 911 dispatchers actually answer both emergency and non-emergency lines so your response will likely be similar. It is always a good idea to have  the non-emergency phone number saved in your phone. That way, if you are not sure if it should be reported, you can call and they will let you know."
"But if hypothetically her husband had been telling the truth, then taking OP's side into consideration could have cost her her marriage. If someone posted here with ""My wife's best friend has accused me of sexual assault, I'm not sure my wife believes my version of events and she wants to keep it secret rather than warn mutual friends"" then people would be saying ""she doesn't trust you, this won't work"".

The situation is really sad because based on the information she had, I can totally understand why OP's friend behaved the way she did - she was just being a good wife, unfortunately she picked a horrifically bad husband.

But she was still a bad friend, who betrayed OP and caused her additional distress during a terrible time, and I don't think OP has any obligation to forgive her for any of that. I don't think I could ever get over being treated that way."
Save that voicemail and anything written where they apologise or admit what the father did so you have proof to show to your friend that you're not lying.
"Your fiancé is acting ridiculous. Don’t let her immaturity ruin your vacation. You did nothing wrong. Is this out of character of her? If not, maybe you can forgive her if she apologizes. If she doesn’t apologize, maybe you should put the wedding on hold until you can figure out what is going on with her."
How much conflict have you had regarding/with his ex in the past? Have you ever been introduced to her? Does she know you exist? 
She only let you cum in her because she was worried after she let her ex all those times during his vacation that she was pregnant. She was going to get you to sign the birth certificate on his child. Why are you letting this happen?

"Hey, the reason it feels like that with your mom is because she never actually had to parent you. You can have as many girlfriends as you want—-you only get one mom, and she took a pass on that job and put  it all on your dad. "
"""We go on dates together fairly regularly (at least once, usually twice a month), and it's fun.""

But you want to spend 2 nights/week gaming?

Seems like an odd ratio. Perhaps a date night/week, a game night/week- little more balance?

Personally if your hobby was photography versus video games I'd understand a little more of needing time to do it (plus it offers other benefits as well). "
"Sorry but your mom sounds like a piece of shit. She left you all on your dad and went off and is now playing happy family- without you. Your dad has worked hard to raise you alongside of his own issues and go to college part time. I’m a stay at home mom with two kids and that’s hard enough. I couldn’t imagine having kids, working AND going to school. That is some serious crap. Please don’t leave your dad. That happy life you envision with your mom will NEVER turn out how you imagine it to be. You will feel left out and never feel in place. Please don’t break your dad’s heart by leaving. He has given everything up to raise you. "
"Let’s say you lose the weight and are his ideal size. 

What happens if you gain some weight after you get married?  What if you get pregnant and can’t lose the baby weight fast enough?   Is he going to threaten divorce or start sleeping around?  This guys sounds like an ass. 

You are a healthy size. Don’t waste any more years with this guy. He will only bring you heartache.

"For an American, you drink a lot. If you were in England, nobody would blink an eye.

"I think his mother getting a part-time job and making some of her own income would alleviate some of this stress. It's not ""helping out,""  if you're just giving her money and she's not working. Helping implies she is making money and ran into a hard spot. That happens sometimes and I think a lot of people are understanding of that fact. Not working and just taking money isn't being helped. It's just living off someone else's income. At 59, she should be able to do a variety of things that supply her with her own income."
God that was the worst part. And she was probably so looking forward to her first baby shower...
Yiddish is by far the best language for expressing shame and disgust. 
"She wants to stay at home and do hobbies... 😂😂😂😂

So does pretty much everyone else, but only small children and retired people get to do that. If you're not either of those things, you're either in school, working, or really rich. That's how it is. Sounds like your wife wants to opt out of adulthood. Too fuckin' bad.

Real talk though, she sounds bored and/or depressed. ~~Get her out of the house once a week to do something not parenting related.~~ Encourage her to see a therapist even if it's just until the kid goes to kindergarten. Otherwise if she wants a nanny, she can pay for it with the money from her new job. Those are her options. That's adulthood.

**Edit:** Nevermind, I just read your comment about how she goes out to see her friends and go to the gym and stuff. Sounds like she's bored of the actual parenting parts of being a parent. I'd still recommend therapy to help her cope with the way her life is because I doubt it's going to change in the near future. Even when the kid goes off to school, I imagine she's still going to be the point parent to do things like pick up and drop off, scheduling and attending appointments, field trips, extra curiculars, addressing emergencies, etc. because your job takes you too far to be readily available for that stuff. Yeah, unless your family dynamic drastically changes, she needs to be ready for all that."
"I just want you to know this is going to end badly for you, and it is entirely your fault.

""Hey honey. I cheated on you with a new girl multiple times and I am interested in her not just physically but emotionally. As a result of this affair, I have discovered you alone are not enough to satisfy me and I need to pursue an open relationship with the woman I cheated on you with while keeping you around as a backup, because I want to have my cake and eat it too. I know this is completely out of nowhere and I have already proven that I do not give a fuck about your opinion because I cheated on you before even talking to you about this, but hey, I've only wasted multiple years of your life, right? Whaddya say sweetie?""

Try that."
"&gt; until he finally tried one on the Colbert show.

So even Tom Brady has tried one. OP's friend still...has...not."
You neglected a very important fact in your story: the fact that she's from another culture where having a live-in-nany who does all the childcare work is the norm.
"&gt;She wants a live-in nanny, like 24hrs 7 days a week 

That’s not how live-in nannies work. They work 40hrs/wk with overtime, and typically don’t cook for the family, or clean up after the parents. The ones that do are usually $45k/yr starting. 

&gt;She enjoys being at home, but doesn’t want to be 100% responsible for all childcare 

She isn’t. The kid goes the preschool for half days, and you watch them 3 nights a week. She’s not even doing *most* of the work. 

Your wife wants you to fund her sitting on her ass all day. Tell her she can get a job and pay for the live in nanny, or things can continue as they are. Stay home and take care of the child, or work and pay for full time childcare. You can’t have your cake and eat it too "
"She sounds like she needs a kick in the arse anyway, because having OP just grin and bear shit like this is ridiculous and just shit parenting."
SIL seems culturally unaware and insensitive. Who cares if she calls you an elitist? This actually has nothing to do with you and your decision. Somehow you using this co worker’s mother was helping SIL out in a particular way.  No need to bullied into helping her save face. 
"IMO... unless it is abusive physically or emotionally then there is nothing you should do. Not your circus, not your monkeys."
"The dude sounds immature. If you feel like someone isn't treating you right in a relationship, you act like a grown up and end the relationship, THEN you go looking for your next girlfriend/boyfriend. It's a pretty bad sign that he says he's cheated on EVERY girl he dated. You're probably walking into a trap, but them love goggles are probably securely fastened to your head."
"Yea, so it's hard to tell, but I'm not sure we (or OP) can tell for sure what the ""ex""'s position actually is. Is the ""fake breakup"" only fake in the sister's head, or was the ""ex"" actually onboard with this idea? Contacting the ""ex"" could easily backfire on OP, so I don't recommend it."
Wouldn't it have been a whole lot easier to say that you were engaged? Make an announcement. Don't sit around waiting for people to ask you. 
"I feel like a good ""Fuck off, asshole"" is in order here."

"Wow.  All of those demands because of having one child.  I have 3 kids and do the cooking, cleaning, shopping, laundry and helping with homework.  I don't see why your wife can't manage with only one child.  "
"Yeah, thats the plan tonight"
"As an honest answer as a young man I personally would act the same way exclusively if I was hiding something my partner would not want to see. 

For something as meaningless/artificial as a social media account, why would he possibly need to protect it from you? "

"She could send out a group text to all her close friends in the area:

Agreed this isn't a revenge/petty thing. It is legitimately dangerous to have a nurse stumble through earning a degree on false pretenses and potentially injure someone in the future.
"Hi, I’m actually the girlfriend.
I’ve been open with Origin about wanting to start a life, our life, throughout the majority of our relationship and he’s never returned the ambition or desire to. I broke up with him once after I moved out and explained that I wanted to be with someone who’s on the same page in life as me. He came before the break of dawn the day after and out of emotions and the heartbreak I took him back. Even after this he didn’t really consider the reasons I broke up with him at all but offered to help part of the bills if I needed it. I broke up with him again after thinking that after 3.5 years he didn’t feel that he could have done anything to be more progressed in our relationship. It wasn’t until after we broke up that he told me he has wanted to eventually marry and have a family with me and that he had dreams for us/about us, which he seldom (if ever) mentioned throughout our relationship. He now wants to take the responsibilities to move in with me and I like to hear that but I had to give him an ultimatum. I had to pay to move into my own place and I bought most appliances/furniture (parents helped some). He now is offering to come in and split the payments when before the breakup he offered moving in with covering a portion of the rent. I want to be with him and I want all of this, but I am terrified of false promises out of desperation. I don’t want to have to break up again. I asked to cut contact 5 days prior to this post and he messaged me the night of, not the day after, but everyday after that. I wanted to give my side to this as well. I just wanted both of us to have time so we aren’t making desperate choices.
Also, I don’t care if there is grammar issues.

Tl;dr: I had to move out on my own and break up with him twice for him to want to start a life with me. I’m scared he’s making false promises."
"You’re almost 40, what are you doing? "
I think engineers and doctors are on similar level as well. I don’t know how anyone could equate it with being a secretary.
"I’ve been on Facebook since it first started, back when it was only open to college students, and I have somewhere between 300-400 friends. 2000 is insane. "
Thank you! I was starting to feel like I was crazy or something 
"She broke up with you because she wants that guy and had an excuse that gave her the ""high road"" so she felt like she was justified and not cheating on you and breaking up with you for the affair partner.

That was cheating. You were cheated on."
"God forbid someone be territorial about their own bed in their own bedroom in their own apartment.

"&gt; our relationship was more than that. 

If it came down to you or his wife you do realize he is picking his wife every single time. 

Also since he is your boss when he chooses his wife do you think he will keep you on as an employee? 

He is most likely using you for a few things. 

You arent the love of his life, you arent the mother of his children. You are a side piece he met at work and there is no way this wont end poorly for you. "
I guarantee you are not doing anything flirty. This co-worker is just jealous of you.
"But is that sustainable for a long term relationship? Because it seems like the confidence you claim to have is a bit flimsy. He basically catfished you, now he's with you and making fun of your body. Can you live with this?"
"From the post, it sounds like OP’s boyfriend *does* actually sleepwalk, but occasionally he will pretend that he’s having a sleepwalking episode and then scare her. So he’s using her knowledge of his sleep issues against her because he knows her guard will be lowered if she thinks he’s actually sleepwalking. It’s fucked up."
"Really just try and put yourself in his shoes and think about how you would react if the situation was reversed. How would you react if he told you one of his female friends confessed their love for him, if he told you that she did? What about if you found out another way than him telling you, how would you react then?"

Thank you.  The responses have been really helpful and illuminating.  It’s weird that this behavior crept in over years and I’m only seeing it now at such an extreme point.  I am feeling ready to let go of this.  It gives me a sense of peace thinking about it.  
"It just gave me time to step back, honestly.  The responses to this post really helped me see that I’m not wrong for reacting the way I did and that breakup is the best option.  I feel much better about it, now TBH."

"I'm still married to him, live with him, am committed to having a family with him. I tried several years with his last name and it doesn't fit me. He hasn't changed anything about his name for me. I don't see why I'm the one being stubborn and insensitive here."

"Have you ever worked in the corporate world? Attorneys could be present for a firing for something as simple as, an employee hasn't been meeting their productivity goals but it is a person of color and they want to make sure that this person of color doesn't accuse the organization of firing them because of their race, age, gender, or religion.

Seriously, comments like this and the one I responded to where someone says ""They escorted him off the premises its gotta be something terrible!"" are comments that really confirm just how young and clueless  a lot of the people here are. 

Do you know what HR is essentially? HR is a team of people who know how to navigate labor laws to make sure they protect your employer from being sued for handling employee related issues such as discipline and being fired. I have *never* worked somewhere that was larger than 100 employees that didn't have a member of HR present for every firing that happened. Most of them don't have law degrees but in a lot of facilities I have worked for I've seen the members of HR responsible for termination having a JD and specializing in labor laws. The lawyers being present doesn't mean that what he did was egregious either. It means they had lawyers present to either make him sign a legally binding contract after he was fired saying he won't pursue unemployment and if he quits now everything he did will disappear. 

She's better off just asking him and heavily implying that if she has to find out because he gets deposed what exactly he did she's going to assume the worst and just leave anyways. 

*Not defending what he did.*

But in a lot of situations where there is a lawyer present and security esorting off the premises its not always the ZOMG worst thing an employee could do. I'm going to say he probably did something so obviously against sexual harassment or harassment laws that there's no way he can argue it. 

But float on over to r/legaladvice and you'll see that companies will have lawyers on hand for even false harassment accusations. https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/7knnng/final_update_terminated_company_says_i_cant_sue_ny/

Maybe, amazingly, before the court of Internet Posters passes judgment, OP should talk to her husband. Maybe he made absolutely no comments at all to this girl about anything sexual harassment related but she didn't like him and wanted him to get fired and he didn't manage to cover his ass and not ever meet with her with his door open and witnesses around so she accused him of sexual harassment. Maybe the company had lawyers present to intimidate him into not fighting these false accusations just like the example I posted above.

Please, think before you respond. OP needs to talk to her husband and ask him to tell her what happened. Maybe he's falsely accused and lawyers were present and he doesn't want to fight back because he doesn't think he could win. We don't know. We weren't there when he did or did not do whatever got him fired."
"""Slut shaming"" is not holding you accountable for your terrible behavior. It's not like you're being promiscuous as a single woman, you're screwing around with another guy while engaged. You can't just write that off with gentle language like ""don't judge my sexual choices"" because unless your fiance knows and is cool with it, what you are doing is objectively awful.

Your sex drive has plumeted but not enough to keep you from sexting this other guy. You already have an open relationship, your partner just doesn't know it yet. You aren't asking him if he'd be willing, you're asking him to forgive your behavior and share you with the guy you've been fucking around with behind his back. You have wasted five years of his life because you lack the maturity to commit to one person or stay single until you figure out what you want. That is the definition of selfishness.

Here is your serious advice. Tell your fiance the truth and think about someone other than yourself for once, if you truly loved him that is what you would do. You have a self-admitted history of fucking other people over to meet your own needs. Act your age and stay out of relationships until you are mature enough to be in one."

"Your boyfriend is emotionally selfish and doesn't want to change. There's no way to force him to. It's not normal, and I'm sorry, but I would consider someone having no concern for my interests or feelings (since you said he ignores anything that doesn't directly interest him, not that he just can't handle negative emotions) as someone who is treating me as toy, not a partner. He understands, he just doesn't *care*, and has repeatedly told you he doesn't care.

When someone tells you they're an asshole, believe them. 

You're unhappy. You've tried to fix it. You're allowed to break up with him even if he doesn't do something ""big"" like cheat. "
"Yeah this prank makes no sense. OP, can you elaborate what the prank was supposed to be? Im so lost. "
" &gt;From her POV it was out of nowhere but I've been pretty clear about not being happy for a while now so I don't know where that's coming from.

I've been there.  I'm sure my ex thought he was clear.  He was not. This may apply to you too, but I don't know for sure. 

&gt;I let her have as much time as needed to move out of my apartment. She took an entire month despite just going to stay with a friend. 

Also been there. That suggests that, because she had no clue, maybe her finances were not as in order as they could have been. Most of the time, people don't want to stay any longer than they need to, especially when it sounds like she's as upset as she is. Living with you during the break up must have been hell. 

&gt; She's called me drunk and crying like 5 times now, begging me to talk to her and comfort her.

I didn't do that... but I would say, after a certain hour... say 10pm or so, maybe just don't pick up the call for now. 

&gt;I know the most obvious solution is to just cut all contact but I really do not feel that is the best solution here. Mainly because I know if that happens all of our friends with side with me and she'll be left with absolutely no social group.

Are these really mutual friends then? It sounds like they're just your friends if they'd automatically side with you. If they're mutual friends, and decent people, they'd make the effort to be friendly to both of you, regardless of the situation. 

&gt; Last night things sorta escalated, though. I've been seeing this new girl and my ex found her on social media and sent her a private message asking if we had cheated. 
 
How does she even know? Why isn't your stuff more private?
That's out of bounds. You really need to tell her that's not okay.  You don't have to be in contact with her. You can avoid social situations that involve mutual friends for a while.

"You’re wrong, it’s is 100% abusive. 

There are three things that are super concerning here. The first is the age gap - it’s not healthy, you’re not the exception and it won’t work. The second is his abuse - it is NEVER ok to grab anyone forcefully or threaten them with violence. The third - you don’t even think he is abusive! 

This is very early days considering how little you see each other. Imagine how badly things could escalate the longer this goes on.

Get home earlier if you can change your ticket, and if not please take every precautionary step to stay safe until you can get home to your family. 

Don’t be one of the people that ignore the advice on leaving an abusive relationship and end up regretting it later, please. You are so young and you have the chance at an amazing life, don’t let anyone (least of all this monster) take that from you. Value yourself. "
"I don’t want you to think you did anything wrong in this situation. If he never expressly stated that he had an issue with you touching his face then don’t feel bad. It sounds like you did nothing malicious and didn’t even touch him that hard so don’t be apologetic. He has his own issues that shouldn’t have escalated to him acting like that. 

Take the time to focus on yourself and people who positively impact your life "

"I wish I had told him to his face but he was at work and I asked him about it over text. He said that it could be from his mom or sister as they were at our house over the weekend, but our door was locked since we weren’t home. Also his mom is a brunette and his sister is a dirty blonde, maybe I’ll text his mom and ask her if either of them were in our room. "
"Yes of course you should tell her, and also tell her WHY you did it. Better to have her know that you are susceptible to peer pressure and tell stupid stories than for her to think you're an academic cheat."
"Different areas I guess. In my hometown it was common for the bus to just drop kids off at the stop, no parents necessary. Many of us were “latchkey kids.”  Pretty common. "
"It doesn’t matter how paranoid or how trusting you are. If someone wants to cheat, they will. But you know what? Chances are you’ll find out. Trust your gut and listen to your instincts. Focus on yourself and doing the things that make you happy and build your self confidence. Taking some attention off of your wife and obsessing over her having the potential to cheat and put it back where it belongs: on yourself. "
There is no you. It is his land. You crossed a line.

"Seemingly, you broke up in October over a similar issue. She needed more space and you needed more affection/appreciation. This time, it's possible she felt it was a repeat and she was done trying.

My fiance says his dad's heart stopped suddenly. Most people interpret it as a heart attack or something.
"&gt;  How do you guys try to talk sense to your parents

You don't.

Repeat after me.  You don't.

One more time, because I'm sure you don't want to believe it.  YOU DON'T.  I have never, ever heard of a story where someone's parents were acting irrational, about relationships or anything else, and then some sort of conversation had them magically see the light and they cut it out.

We all know this type of parent, and if you frequent this sub, you should know this type of parent, too.  They are overly controlling with their children, and that might never stop, regardless of how old they get.  You cannot talk sense into them, but what you CAN do is realize that you have the power in this relationship.

You are legally an adult, but someone else put this very aptly (don't remember who).  Adulthood is not given, it is taken.  You can wait around for your parents to just suddenly recognize that you're an adult, and you will be waiting forever.  Or, you take it.  You make them realize that the relationship is different now, and that if they act badly (as they are now), you won't be putting up with it.

Doing this is essentially impossible as long as you are dependent on them, and it's clear you still live with them.  They could, at any time, change the rules on you, and threaten to kick you out if you don't comply.  Remove that power.  Move out.  I saw in another comment that you had plans to, and they tried to say it would ruin your relationship with them.  GOOD.  Your current relationship with them needs to be ruined, because it's them in a position of power, treating you like a child.  Move out, let them whine and complain about it, and ignore them when they act badly.  This will force them to make a decision.  Either they get to interact with their adult daughter like reasonable people, or they don't.

Do you have a job?  Are they supporting you financially?  If so, that needs to be changed.  If you are unable, or unwilling, to change it, then you need to recognize that continuing to receive their support most likely means you will be abiding by any and all ridiculous rules that they have.  For some people that's worth it.  For many, it is not.

Parents of adults only have as much power as they are allowed to have.  And yes, initially, they WILL raise hell.  They will call you every name they can think of, act like you're the worst daughter ever, threaten to disown you, etc etc.  Some parents will never get past that, and good riddance.  But a lot will eventually recognize that you are an adult, and if they want to interact with you, they need to treat you as such.

Take control of the relationship, set your terms, and then stick to your guns.  When they act badly (and they will, a lot, at the start), end the conversation.  Tell them you won't put up with it, hang up the phone, walk out the door, go to your house, and ignore them until they apologize.  Eventually they will get the message, unless they are among the parents who are never able to get over their pride and adapt to an adult relationship.  Which, again, if they are, good riddance, you do not need such people in your life."
"I think this would be a reasonable request. Plus you get the added benefit of there being ""proof"" that you had the conversation. "
"Oh yikes.

Yeah that sounds horrible. You just reminded him how he is disposable in your eyes.

This must have been a real struggle for him, he was prepared to give up the baby and you unilaterally decided that he has to raise this baby if he wants to stay with you.

And this whole time you've been having a blast, while I assume he's struggling to even bond with his child. I think your husband needs some attention and reassurance that he's just as important as he was before that child was here. And maybe consider a therapy session with you and him to make sure he's doing alright since the baby."
I am not sure why stopping all sex would be necessary to deal with your problem. It seems like it would put a lot less stressful on the relationship to just stop using any toys and agree not to worry if you aren't able to finish for a while. 
"You think your need to tell her you don't care her friend died a violent death trumps her need to share that someone she was once close to died a horrible death?

Wow, dude. You're obviously not over the betrayal and I get it, but you need to just break up if this is how you're going to act about it. Who cares if you had a stressful day at work? She had a stressful day finding out her friend plummeted to his fucking death."
"Are you familiar with American healthcare? That medication is EXPENSIVE, and if you lose your insurance it results in a disease that fucks you up. My good friend is a nurse, and the number of young diabetics with amputated legs because they can't afford to maintain a treatment...

It's a big deal. It's noble to not want AIDS to have a stigma, but I don't think it's right to minimize what happened here."
Please explain why it's bad for the boyfriend to have female friends and hang out with them...
"&gt; The more I type the more this doesn't look good.

Well at least you're self-aware. 

Look, it's certainly not guaranteed that your wife is going to cheat on you, but you do know that she has been consistently willing to betray her past partners based entirely on how she feels at the moment, rather than addressing her concerns with an open and honest dialogue. 

&gt; She claims the reasons she cheated are, alternately, that she just didn't care, and that she didn't feel her boyfriends actually wanted her.

*Unless she has gone through a complete personality transformation,* this is telling you that you have zero control over whether she cheats. She can arbitrarily decide ""u/clodsofhurt doesn't want me enough,"" and that's enough justification for her.

I'm not going to suggest that you divorce her because it's clear you want to make this relationship work, but if you want to be with her you are going to have to take a leap of faith that she's become a fundamentally different person since her previous relationships. Save your money on the counseling, because there are really no deeper psychological layers you can uncover here. You know the odds, now you just have to decide if you're going to take the gamble."
"That's because he's already at 50/50 even though you and your kids cost a lot more than he does by himself. He's already paying proportionally more than you, asking for more would be unfair. "

"Tell her that you love her and ask her what one thing she thinks would make your marriage better.  Be sure you emphasize that you are serious, that you want the truth because you are afraid that you aren't as close as you were and you will do *whatever* it takes to get  back on track.   

When she says that she wishes Jess were out of your life, tell her DONE!  Then tell her about your dinner with Mark.

EDIT: when you tell her you will shut down your ""friendship"" -- do not talk about how hard it will be, or how you really don't want to do it, etc  Just tell her that your marriage comes first and you will do it.  Don't look to your wife for comfort over breaking up with your girlfriend."
"From an immigration perspective, usually, no. It will usually still be a new visa process. It may be easier to *get* a job through local networks, but you will probably have to get a new work permit and visa, and probably have to leave the country in between. You may even find the process harder because once you've lived there, you will need local police clearances as well as ones from your home country, and that is not always easy to achieve if you haven't been there long. Do not assume that going and switching is easier - it's often best to come on the visa you intend to use from the beginning."
"Has she ever expressed any concern for what you went through in being assaulted?

I mean, she's hurting now, so she wants a friend. She's thinking about herself. Did she ever think about the hurt that you went through?  I would confront her with that directly. 

 If she wants a friend, she should be a friend, too, and that means showing some concern and compassion towards not only what you went through in the aftermath of the ordeal, but during those moments of the assault as well."
Yep that she did. I found that strange too. If I'm visiting my cousin and her ex invites me to hang out without her or something.. like no..? I'm not all about picking sides or anything but.. I'm part of my cousin's package.
"Right, it's both highly unusual AND he's being immature about it."
"You need to get the idea of a woman being physically aroused meaning the same as attraction and being mentally aroused out of your head.

Lube is your friend. Use it. No it doesn't mean she doesn't want to have sex. It means her body didn't get the memo on time AND THAT'S NORMAL. 

You need to get over that. 

If you can't maybe see a counselor and get some advice there. "
"NO worthy therapist would perform couples counselling in this instance. HE needs therapy to work out why he’s an abusive boyfriend and to help him take ownership of his actions and she needs therapy to work out she can do better than wait around to get punched again. 

At the minute, this is not salvageable, OP is minimising his actions and it’s all about how HE feels. HE felt awful seeing the bruise? Doesn’t compare to how she felt being smashed in the face by someone who says he loves her. 

People CAN change, but it’s hard work and I don’t know the OP is willing to do it when it comes down to it. 

OP, Domestic abuse isn’t about anger, it’s about power and control. You don’t need anger management if you can keep your temper with everyone else, you need intensive therapy to work out why you are so insecure, you resort to physical violence. "
"Move out.

Until you can, don’t let him stop you going to the bathroom. Walk past him and slam the door in his face if you need to."
He hasn't hit for years... but he used to. 
"I get where you're both coming from, but yeah, it's not fair to ask him to put your relationship on hold while you decide whether or not you want to stay with him. 

I recommend doing a lot of journaling and introspection while you work through your doubts. Therapy was also really helpful to me in deciding whether or not to leave a long relationship. "
"I would suggest exploring this topic with a therapist. I think it's awesome that you used your 5 free sessions for therapy before, but it sounds like now is the time to do some extended therapy to get to the bottom of why you feel drained when it comes time to be sexual with a woman you're interested in.

For the record, yes, I have known a few men who have experienced this. They never admitted why they felt pressured by sex, but I've seen the pattern of ""ghosting"" when it comes down to ""doing the deed."" What you're experiencing isn't unheard of, and I'm sure there's a very logical explanation for what's causing it - it would just be difficult (if not impossible) for anonymous reddit users to help you find the root cause. I think seeing a therapist would be very beneficial, especially one who is male and has a background in healing trauma."
"Him having strong bonds to his family is perfectly acceptable.

This is no different than any other life plan really. He has this life plan that is very important to him. And has been mostly up front with you about it. He obviously wants to find a partner that is accepting of this life plan. And either that is you or it isn't you. "
"The petty thing would be to have your parents email back, ""Oh, we didn't see it like that at all. Not that it's our business, but as her parents we've always been supportive of her priorities since I'm sure she's thinking for her and her husbands' best interests (as she should) instead of ours!""

The correct thing to do though would be to have your husband deal with his mom by gently reminding her that your life does not revolve around her illness' timeline.  DO NOT bring up your career as a reason. There doesn't need to be a reason for why you don't want kids now. You just don't. Don't give her excuses to latch on to because they distract from the main message, which is that you don't want kids now and it's your wants which matter, not your MIL's. "
What she did is unforgivable. You were raped and her response was to call you names and shit-talk you to friends. She’s a terrible person. 
"I'm with you.

The cam stuff - sure. That only has to come up because there is evidence of it out there and it is best to hear it from her instead of discovering it later.

But the abortion? That is absolutely no ones business at all. She can tell him if she wants but is absolutely not required to."
"Came here to say this. OP gave him a very clear boundary, and told him what she would do if the affair continued, and he had a choice whether he wanted to lose his marriage or not. How cowardly to now say, “You wanted me to do this, how dare you, I have a RIGHT to be upset.” And blame this all on her when it was his dumb ass that had an affair and put their marriage in jeopardy in the first place. "
"So, that IS admittedly a Rick and Morty reference buuuuuut it's totally not acceptable. I'm in a healthy relationship and unless it was a mutual friend my gf would not be thrilled seeing that.

After two months, you totally should have been invited. Was this trip planned before you two started dating? If so, that sucks but a similar situation happened to me. If not, that's total bs."
How long have you known your bf? Two months? Or are you just dating the past two months and you've known each other longer than that?
"The only thing you can do is be completely upfront, honest and open, and avoid anything that could be remotely considered shady and do that forever."

"We also pay because it engenders independence. American kids are independent a lot earlier and become adults a lot earlier. Many Indian kids are tied to their parents until they’re married. If someone’s supporting you financially, they have a lot more say over how you live.

We might have to pay for college, but we also get to choose who we want to marry and how we want to live. Worthwhile trade off IMO."
"If you could have walked home, he could have walked there. He could have driven there. He could have used another phone to call your workplace, he could have told you if he was sick, or really needed to sleep, he could have left a note on the door.

He could have been honest with his parents, he could have paid for the damage himself. He's blaming you for his discomfort when you are reasonably upset. At 23, this sort of behavior is unacceptable. If you want to have a considerate partner, you'll need to find a different one."

"Well yeah. For a start nobody would ever throw out a railcard, it's something that you absolutely have to have with you if you're travelling (I had one for years) because the fines if you don't have it are hefty. 

So if anything it's much less likely that you'll end up with a friend's railcard than the edge of a condom wrapper. "
"He told you to “just deal with your emotions??”

He wants to bury it but you have to face this together if you want to move past it. If you can’t work on this together, counseling is the way to go. "
That’s actually a great question because she actually really liked my present because I’m spending basely all weekend in the water with her up and down the California coast teaching her how to surf and she loves it. So to me she’s been incredibly grateful and appreciative which is a huge contrast to what but showed her parents.
"Your girlfriend doesn't dislike your family because they've done anything wrong, she dislikes them because they prevent you from giving her attention 24/7.

If it wasn't your family, it would be your friends, or your job, or anything else that gets in the way of her getting what she wants. "
Stop being so condescending and pushing your religion please
"Hey OP! I've dealt with people who think scaring people is fun or just a silly thing to do. Even when you cry, it can be difficult for people who think scaring is fun is actually a distressing thing to some people.

I hate jump scares. Like, I don't own a toaster because the anticipation of toast popping out makes me a bit tense. I had a SO who thought they were hilarious. He did a jump scare once with me, and I flat out said, ""Realize if you do jump scares with me, it causes me a lot of anxiety. I will not be able to date you because I will have too much anxiety anticipating jump scares. I don't find it fun, silly or whatever. It makes me feel anxious and very angry. Being able to feel protected and safe with my partner is important for me, and we can't achieve that if you purposely scare me. This is your first warning. If you jump scare me again, I will break up with you because I will never be able to relax around you.""

Guess what? He never jump scared me again. Use your words, and emphasize how much distress these scares cause you. If your SO continues his scaring, then your SO is being a jerk and you'll have to do some soul searching."

"Are you serious? OP got STD tests. She tested clean. Presumably they both agreed they were safe enough to stop using condoms - she didn't decide that unilaterally. It was just as much his responsibility as hers to understand what a clean test means and doesn't mean, and decide what he's willing to risk."
"So, you're a bit insecure. What is she insecure about? Would you tease her about that? Teasing about an insecurity is only ok if both of you think it's ok. You could try talking to her again, emphasizing how it makes you feel, like you're being disrespected and put down. Use ""I feel"" statements. 

Are you planning on premarital counseling? I'd recommend it for any couple, and this might be something you can bring up."
She should have mourned in silence. The fact she expected an emotional suppport from OP in this particular situation is quite ridiculous in the first place.

"Sorry my original comment wasn’t clear. Wasn’t saying age discrimination doesn’t exist in general, because it does, just that it’s clearly being used as an excuse in this instance to sponge off her son. "
"Exactly.  It is crazy to think about but I smoked Meth and even snorted it back in the day.  I just never saw what a lot of other people did in it and uppers are not my thing, so no addiction happened.  I dodged a big bullet, but back when I tried it no one really talked about how horrible it was, back then it was called crank or crystal meth. 

I knew enough to stay away from heroin or cocaine, but you'd be surprised how many people actually have tried hard drugs.  They are just ashamed to bring it up or don't want to face judgement. 

The fact that the friend is sneaking away is troubling, and also if you feel like your friend is going down a bad path don't be afraid to speak up.  My ex said a friend of his punched him in the face when he told him he had tried cocaine.  Not the best way to make a point, but he never did it again. "
"1) Girlfriend was jealous of your relationship with him, asked/made him cut you out of his life to continue relationship.

2) Most friends he has now are likely mutual friends with his SO, word getting back to her (of a positive interaction between the two of you) would probably get him in trouble w/ her.

3) He already chose her over you.  It sucks, but you really shouldn't expect much else from him at this point.  Here's a similar story:

I was friends with a guy for a couple of years.  He got a new SO, we all hung out, it was great.  He and I were buddies, she and I were buddies, etc.  One day, she decides I am now ""a negative influence"", and that both her and her SO (my friend), should cut me out of their lives.  He immediately goes along with this, only saying hi to me if there was NO chance it could get back to her.

After about 6 months of ghosting, she went on a trip for a few months and he asked me to grab lunch.  I was still (obviously) hurt and upset by his actions, but I went to see where he stood.  He didn't even apologize for how he treated me for six months!!! It was just ""She wanted me to stop, what was I supposed to do?

Some people can't stand up to SO's, be it due to fear or power dynamics or what-have-you.  Your ex-friend is one of those people.  Let him live under her thumb for as long as he is willing to be trodden upon.  You owe him nothing anymore."

"I think it's possible that this brush with his own mortality has him in a really vulnerable place and he doesn't know how to express it. Also, if this is the first major issue you two have had you are also seeing how he really deals with the hard times. You guys need to get into therapy immediately, together and separate. You've both undergone and are still going through a traumatic event and need help sorting through those emotions. I hope you are able to get a break from all the stress on you. "

"This is totally true, but I also think you need to take into account who your partner is. He's made it clear that cooking is totally not this thing, so why would OP focus on the one specific thing he doesn't like or want to do?


It may be that this is a general pattern with him, in which case, I'm definitely on the wrong track here. Women overwhelmingly are expected to do more labor, emotional and domestic, than men and I don't at all want to come across as being too easy on him if that's the case.


But just from the OP, she doesn't say he doesn't help her in other areas. For all we know, he's doing a lot of the cleaning or laundry or otherwise contributing in other ways, so I don't think it's quite fair to say he's not thinking of her needs and doing his share of the work yet. 


If he is in general a supportive partner doing his share of the work, but who just hates to cook, then I don't see anything wrong with him fending for himself and her fending for herself. If he's not generally doing his fair share, then of course I see where OP is coming from. "
"&gt;  ""something will click, don't worry about it""

I hate this outlook so much. I would honestly tell him you can't keep working overtime and double so he can figure out what he wants to do with his life. I would say you're burnt out and can't be the only one keeping the family afloat. Tell him when you married him, you thought it was going to be a partnership and that the status quo is not sustainable for you.

If he still says the blah blah stuff will work out, I'd tell him its time for couple's counselling. It is sad that he can watch you work your ass off to keep you guys afloat and refuse to even discuss getting a job with you. "

"Think about it as if you and your brother were girls and she was a man. A 40-something year old dude sleeps with a 16 year old girl then tries to sleep with her 19-year old sister and then goes back to the 16-year old after being rejected. sounds super creepy right?

I understand that the dynamic is different given your genders. If you really wanted to stop her advances i'm sure you could overpower her; which is the main difference between the scenario I described above.  however you're still dealing with someone mentally unstable or at the very least a sexual deviant and what she did wasn't right. For now you seem to be pretty cool with everything and you most likely feel good about yourself. You haven't given much detail about how she's acting attached or ""addicted"" . if her actions really concern you then you should tell your mother."

I think she does do things like this to her future husband. When I told him what happened and said I didn't know she had this side to her, he replied ""oh yeah, she knows exactly what to say to push buttons/be hurtful."" That was really alarming to me.

I'm really not trying to make her sound like a terrible person, I just think she's very sick and lost. But thinking about anyone making my husband feel the way I did that night - especially ME - causes me physical pain."
"Often, the kind of person who thinks they have the right to violate your boundaries also tries to place the blame on the victim, claiming they were leading them on or ""asking for it."" 

This kind of person is trying to place the blame on someone else for their behavior. 

Telling someone to back off as you did, multiple times with a clearly stated consequence, is exactly the opposite of leading him on. 

Leading someone on requires the intention to do so. One cannot accidently lead someone on. You know better than anyone else in the world whether you need someone on. 

In fact, let's go ahead and generalize this rule. Anybody who claims you were feeling X is either projecting their crap onto you or trying to dominate you by blaming you for something false. In other words, they are gaslighting you. 

You are in control of your mind. Only you know for sure what is going on in there. Furthermore, every person is responsible for his or her own actions. Unless you put a gun to his head and ordered him to kiss you, that was 100% his choice. 

The next time someone tries to tell you that you led them on, remember that regardless of how they want to frame it, their actions are all on them. You never need to validate that kind of person by apologizing (unless of course is is a matter of personal safety). 

&gt; He then asked me not to tell anyone that this had happened.  

Now why should you stay silent about this? You in him nothing. Do not think you have to protect him. 

In fact, this statement is proof that he has pulled this stunt before. It is up to you, but I think that you should tell people exactly what went down.

"Yeah. Very hurtful. In my last long term relationship my ex told me he wasn't the marrying type, thought weddings were a sham, and after seeing his parents' messy divorce he wasn't up for the legal part of it. Totally acceptable answer! My current boyfriend and I have talked about how we want to get married, we've even discussed what our ideal wedding would look like. We're almost a year in, so *of course* the unspoken understanding is that we're not going to get married tomorrow. Or even in five years, perhaps. Who knows? Logically we might break up in two. But for us to say ""I'd get married, but only if I met the right person"" to someone you're seriously dating seems excessive, almost like a warning, like you're putting your current SO in the compartment of ""Good for now, find someone better later."""
"It says she worked part time, so it must not be something she sees as a career. Either way, I’d have to win a lifetime’s worth of money, like $1M or more, to quit my job. "
"&gt;He needs to learn to get past this or divorce his wife.

Yeah, it boils down to these two options:

1) Accept that this is the partner he's chosen and learn to redirect the obsessive thoughts. CBT will help with this.

2) Accept that he can't live this way and end it. "
"&gt; He said he thought it’d be worse.

He knew this was going to happen and he let it and he took you there for it. He's an expletive deleted.

It's 4 months. Let him go. His family are awful and he is awful. Don't serve yourself up for more of this - it won't get better."
I’m so sad now. 
"I hadn't even thought of that. Ironically, my fiancé has a family surname from his mother's side that he wishes to pass on to our children since his brother has shown no interest, which I had already agreed to use as a middle name for a future child.

My main worry is that if our children have the same name as him but not me, then we will become the 'Fiancé's Surnames' family by default. I understand that I am opting out of such a bracket by choice by not taking my fiancé's name, however I would be worried of the distance between myself and the rest of my future family if they too had his name."
"Yeah, I’d be made uncomfortable by this too. Why were you so far down his insta feed? Did you really scroll back purely to find an old picture of his to make fun of?"

"&gt;if I truly loved her I would do ...

This is a very   red flag indeed. Anyone who uses that line is by definition manipulative and to be avoided.

Perhaps going alone on a super trip she cant afford is selfish (IMHO it is inconsiderate - why not wait till she can afford to come too, on her own money?), perhaps it isn't. But her *expecting* you to use *your* hard-earned money for a holiday? wow, nope. 

And the whole ""cheating"" spiel is just bitter, childish, disrespectful, and IMHO dumpworthy.  Imagine the demands for facetiming on the hour every hour.Just imagine the de-briefing inquisition she's gonna put you through.

Just tell her to go fuck herself"
"Some other comments basically say ""I don't know why you'd be bothered"", ""Just accept it!"", or ""lol get his own makeup!"" as if there's somehow an automatic expectation that people have to be okay with this sort of thing. The lying about it is swept under the rug because ""oh he might have been scared to tell you!"" yet if that were about anything else in a relationship, its a redflag."
"""On some occasions, he also said that i lower his social status by looking not nice enough.""

This really sums it up. Your boyfriend is a cruel, superficial, status-obsessed jerk who uses you and doesn't care about your feelings. HE calls you stupid and autistic because HE WANTS TO HURT YOU. He tells you other women look better because HE WANTS YOU TO FEEL BAD ABOUT YOURSELF. He shoves you and threatens to hit you because HE WANTS YOU TO BE AFRAID OF HIM. 

He wants to tear you down, and convince you that you are bad at everything, so you won't feel like you could make it on your own, but you 100% can. You can and you will. "
"Bleah, what a pain in the butt situation. As weird as this will feel, write the latest (or the next) rando back and say ""Hi! Someone has been giving out my number and I am not the girl you met. My husband saw this message and it is causing a bit of a fuss for us. Can you please write back and confirm where and when you got the number and a little about the girl (name, description) who gave it to you so he can be assured it was not me?""

If the guy has an ounce of humanity hopefully he would cooperate. 

Though it's a pity your husband isn't more ready to believe you, considering that you were very forthcoming."
Agreed. I would definitely change my business or personal number if I started getting random texts from people that didn't stop.
"Your daughter is 26 years old! It’s nice you like spending time with her, but it’s long past time for your baby bird to leave the nest. You’re not doing her any favors here. What about when she’s 36? Will she still be living at home? What will happen when you and your wife pass?"
"I can already imagine her attempts to over-explain herself if I say something like that, but I like it! Thank you."
"It seems like part of the problem here is you keep adding fuel to the fire by attempting to correct her when she's wrong. You got a job offer with a salary of $98K, in which she had ZERO input. What does it matter if she thinks Ken's experience is superior to yours? What does it matter if she gets wrong the amount of experience you have?

It sounds to me like if you would essentially smile and nod at her comments she would move on to talking about something else. The fact that you are correcting her in what sounds like a bid to gain respect from her based on your years of experience and qualifications is just dragging out the negative interactions. She doesn't respect you as a professional...so what? You're not going to convince her otherwise, no matter what you say, so I believe you're better off cutting your losses and not extending the conversation longer than absolutely necessary.
"
this is the worst advice ever. She needs to get permission before cutting off TWO INCHES OF HAIR???

Also maybe because she doesn't have a significant other.

"I don't mean any offense, but judging from your post and your comments, you seem a lot younger than 28. Do you perhaps not have much relationship experience?"
"To be clear: you had been working 76 hours a week normally, and for the past month have been working 96 hours a week. You're now down to 40 hours, as of two weeks ago. Right?



1) You need a vacation. Like, NEED a vacation. That is an insane amount of work week in and week out, and good for you for making a vacation a priority!




2) When on Earth did you have time to see your girlfriend? Was she okay with you working almost 100 hours a week? Do you live together? When was the last time you took a vacation together? It's possible she's been feeling really neglected for the past 6 months, and so you taking a vacation without her now is just rubbing salt in those wounds.




3) You're right, from this post she is being completely irrational and a bit selfish expecting you to pay for her too. I imagine it's from anxiety about not seeing you much the last 7 months, and anger that you're still not making her/your relationship a priority, but it is still irrational. You have to talk to her, about how you need to do this for yourself, but it's going to be really difficult (as you are experiencing) when she's probably been feeling neglected and now rejected.




4) This is a side note, but how are you affording a trip to one of the most expensive countries in the world on 2 grand? That's crazy savings! Hopefully you can actually afford to do everything you want to do, from a quick calculation flights alone are half your budget."
"&gt; Well that would be on her for speaking in code and expecting me to read her mind.

Yes that is what I'm saying, that she misrepresented her intentions.  It obvious that she wasn't saying what she actually meant.  That's an issue you need to address with her."
"Honestly if she’s complaining about every entry level worker she is probably the one that’s wrong in these situations/made a mistake. I can’t begin to express how many customers I help in customer service who are 100% wrong but I fix their stupid mistakes anyway while they gloat about how the other person that helped them was “stupid” “wrong” “rude” etc. Even if I point out that they misread the sign or something they just say “Well it’s not my fault the print is so tiny! That’s stupid!” So your GF is probably wrong most of these times and using the stories as something to complain about because she’s just soooo much smarter than someone who’s making minimum wage, isn’t it obvious. I find it hard to believe she has that many stories of workers wronging her."
"That's great, I'm glad you were able to make that change, but this isn't a pissing contest. "
"Some relationships that start that young DO last.

That said, the first 6-12 months are a blur of a WHOLE bunch of chemicals released in your brain when you fall in love with someone. That's going to back off a bit over time. Enjoy it while it lasts, just don't make LIFE ALTERING DECISIONS just yet:

1) Please do not get pregnant or married just yet. 

2) Please do not make decisions that will affect the REST of your life, such as whether or where to go to college, solely on the basis of this relationship.

If the relationship is as solid as you think it is, it will be just fine following the two items above."
"I would not be interested in dating someone who intentionally cultivated friendships with women who behaved inappropriately with him.

I don't necessarily think that there's much going on here, but I do disagree that he doesn't have responsibility to make sure his friendships are respectful of his relationship.

"I agree that the age inequality is surely playing a part - controlling, condescending, judgemental - PARENTAL..."
"what, specifically, is he worried about? 

that you will cheat? that the ex will see you undressed? (different from everyone else who sees the photos?) that ex might make inappropriate comments that upset you? 

if he's just upset about his ownership of your body, or if he doesn't trust you, then there's not much you can do. if he has a specific concern, then perhaps you can give him some concrete idea of how you will act and avoid any questionable situations. if he's insecure, then maybe you can reassure him of the things you like about him and value more than any ex.

"Came here to post this. Please do this. It can be hard for us to separate our own anger, frustration and hurt from wanting to do what's right for our kids. An impartial professional is a crucial resource for getting decisions like this right."

I think there is a possibly that she drugged me. But I think I’m refusing to believe it as she’s been my best friend for so long. "

She did though. She talked to one of the cops. 
"It seems like you are making a lot of effort to be a family man, but do you guys ever take time to do anything alone together? Have you tried scheduling a special date night where the two of you can get romantic as a couple as opposed to just peacefully co-existing as parents? It could be that she's just fallen into the rut of being a team member and you two might benefit from having some exciting outside-of-the-house alone time together. "
"I dont see this going anywhere good, in a ldr trust is everything, and she broke that.
Now youll be stressed everytime she goes out to party, or makes a new male friend . And she'll feel suffocated because  you'll restrict her and keep bringing this up (ex. ""I dont want you to talk more to him than to me, remember last time"")

"there’s a really simple fix to this, and it’s to send them to a psych for evaluation. If they do have OCD then they can get advice on meds/talking therapy to help them manage their obsessions and compulsions. If they don’t then it will have much more weight coming from a professional. Best of luck"
"I don’t know if she cheated on you or not, but you are not overreacting. 

As a female, I’d never go skinny dipping alone with a man that’s not my partner, if I was married or in a relationship. It doesn’t make sense to me. 

The fact that she’s lying to you about it is a red flag imo. I’d be curious as to why she is lying and would be suspicious. "
"It's true about people loving tall women. I'm above average height but nowhere near 6ft and any time I see really tall women,  I think it's awesome. A friend of mine is like 6'4 and she's married to the love of her life, has a family, and is always in demand by women and men in our dance community. Own being tall, Op!


As a side note, I'd recommend getting into partner dancing (blues, swing, etc). You'll be seeked out left and right as a follow and lead!"
"Honestly, while it would be tragic if she went back to her ex, I don't think it would be the best thing for her to date you either right now. 

I have also survived an abusive relationship and it takes *years* to heal from that shit. The best thing for me was to be single for a while. I wouldn't have been able to function in a healthy relationship because I had been so far detached from what that is, and from my own sense of self, for so long.

If you can, please direct her to a source of support. But don't try to be that support and don't try to date her. You would be doing her no favours."
"Yeah, you're right, he did do something wrong.
He should never have allowed his wife to dictate whether he can or cannot masturbate in the first place.

We speak of women's body autonomy all the freaking time. The same principle should be applied to men.

He never should have agreed to it. That's where he went wrong.

&gt;and didn't communicate that he was unhappy with their sex life

Really?:

&gt;She makes it seem like a chore. I have discussed this with her countless times. When I try to initiate sex, there is usually an excuse or she makes me feel bad about wanting it.

&gt;I attempted to talk to here here and there and tell her how it was purely just to release and I didn't want to get into it with her if I asked for sex, like what always happens. She just basically tossed any sort of reasoning aside. 

----

&gt;it's kinda understandable that the wife would be feeling upset and betrayed right now

Not really. I get that they made an agreement, but consideration needs to be given to whether this agreement is at all reasonable."
"&gt;It’s just the idea that the girl he picked to be his FWB is not what I expected at all.

... Are you sure that you’re not jealous? You’re really saying that you dislike her this much just because she’s not what you expected (and then contrast her physical appearance to your own)?"
"This is because you've taught her that her temper tantrums work. She's an adult. You need to set and *hold* clear boundaries. You are not responsible for her.

I think grey rocking may be in order. Don't argue with her. Repeat yourself (""I've said no, you need to figure something else out"") and then remove yourself from the conversation if she continues (""I can see that you aren't understanding me clearly. I've said no. That's my answer. Goodbye"") then walk out or hang up."
"It's very confusing to be honest, I messaged them and asked about it but just got the auto response, none of which applied to my post.

This is what I originally wrote back in December:

*It's all in the title really. About two weeks ago I found out that the person I've been seeing since September has been relying on a mixture of friends, shelters and various all-night type spaces to keep a roof over his head at night since the spring, and when he hasn't been able to find that, he's just not had one. I genuinely had no idea. He's always been clean and tidy for our dates and very well put-together, and even had me pick him up from outside a specific house on a couple of occasions (I had noticed he never invited me in, but I assumed it was a house share and he just preferred not to and/or he wanted to keep a bit of distance between us). Then a couple of weeks ago I stumbled on him completely by accident as he was trying to sleep in a sheltered corner outside some shops.

I didn't really know what to do and I admit I got a bit upset (shocked and worried). We had a bit of an argument, he tried to deny it but it was pretty obvious so then he got angry and said he was 'fine', which I vehemently disagreed with (apart from anything else it was bloody freezing!) and told him in no uncertain terms that I'd pay for a hotel room or he could come home with me, but he was not staying outside on the ground (they were predicting snow FFS!). At that point he sort of deflated and agreed to come with me.

Anyway, got him home and he's been here ever since (that was the Monday before last). For the first few days, he was very sluggish (I get the feeling he pretty much just slept while I was at work and only got up and dressed just before I got home), but after that he perked up considerably. I've given him key and been leaving him cash, and been coming home to three course meals (he's a brilliant cook), fresh flowers on the table and a flat that's been cleaned to within an inch of its life. I've told him he doesn't need to do those things but he says he finds it 'therapeutic', so I haven't pressed it. I've found out a bit about how he ended up the way he was, it seems like your classic case of 'slipping through the cracks': Fled an abusive living situation with very little, lost his minimum wage job shortly afterwards and failed to find another so got kicked out of the room he was renting, has no contact with family and friends were sympathetic but not doing too much better themselves and not in a position to help much beyond letting him shower and wash his clothes sometimes. He's been getting by doing odd bits of work under the table, selling small crafts he makes with found items (he's very creative) and that sort of thing, which give him enough for the basic necessities 'most days'.

The thing is, I'm still not sure what happens now? Neither of us have brought up the situation since he came home with me, but I feel like it needs to be discussed. Part of my reluctance is that I'm finding I really like us like this. I like him being around, I like sharing space with him, and I think I'm probably in love with him. I would be happy if he wanted to keep living here and continue as we are. However, I'm also conscious that him being here is not entirely a choice. We were seeing each other regularly for a good couple of months before this and after the sluggishness of the first few days, he's seemed quite happy and chirpy, but it's still not the same as having the conversation and freely making the decision. If he wanted to move out somewhere I'd be prepared to help him with that too, I could lend/give him some money for a deposit on a room or something.

If he did decide to stay, we'd also have to figure something out regarding the money situation. He's been looking for work since he lost his last job but has so far had no luck, and he has been very reluctant to take any money for himself while he's been here. I've been leaving him cash and he's been spending it on groceries to feed us both, but he won't buy anything at all for himself, even really basic stuff, unless I'm there and buy it for him. That's really uncomfortable for me, and not the kind of dynamic I want with my partner. I'm in the fortunate position that I earn a good salary doing a job I enjoy and can comfortably support us both, which I'd happy to do for him/us, but I would need him to see it as a partnership situation, where we're both playing our strengths to support each other and the relationship and my strength just happens to bring in the green, rather than a situation where I'm in control of everything and generously bestowing basic necessities on him (like a toothpaste that he's not allergic to). I'm struggling to see how such a conversation can reasonably be had when he has so few practical options at the moment.

TL;DR: I found out the man I've been seeing for a couple of months was hopeless and more or less made him move in with me on an emergency basis two weeks ago. We haven't talked about it since and I think we need to, I'd like to make things more permanent but mostly I'd like to help him do whatever it is he wants. I don't know how to go about having that conversation in a way which doesn't feel like I hold all the cards.*"
She has probably been that way all of her life. Accept it or leave. Don't put her down for it. That ain't cool.
"Your girlfriend is aware that  she is not dexterous.  She's probably been scolded or made fun of in various situations.  Apologize and talk to her about it.   It may be worthwhile to consult a doctor about fine motor control and see if there is a treatable condition there.

This is not and issue of her not being aware or careful,  she can't help it.  You have to recognize and accept that this is  part of her.    Instead of trying to change her, be mindful of her surroundings."
I agree it's a valid reason. 
"You absolutely should qualify for intake at a domestic violence shelter. I do feel for you, but you have got to get out. You cannot expect us to tell you to work on a relationship like this or that you can change his behavior by doing or saying X thing because the truth is *you cannot.* Your best option is to go to a shelter and sit down with their career resources person. You already have a job, which is a lot more than some people at the center can say when they arrive. It won’t be permenant, it’s a jumping off point to freedom and independence. I know that you can get out. When I was in an abusive relationship I was twice as deluded and probably ten times as in denial as you are, and I managed. You will do it, please do it soon. "

"At this point, I'm the one putting off the wedding. I have cold feet and this is one big reason.

"I don't know that there is any silver bullet to make a teenager not feel like an awkward weirdo. Everyone has to grow into themselves as part of becoming an adult. Maybe check out Aly Stosz instagram, she is HUGE and absolutely owning it.

I gotta be honest, you'll probably always get a lot of attention for this because... well, being really tall is VERY COOL. However, as the people around you age, too, they will (hopefully?) mostly learn better manners around commenting on other peoples' bodies. I'm almost 30 and of very average height, and I still get very excited when I meet someone who is 6'5""+, but at some point you learn not to alienate people by making them feel as though they're being examined and graded or objectified and marveled over. So just stick it out and eventually it'll get easier."
"thanks for posting this, i hadn't heard of 'the mental load' before! i left my ex-husband 3+ years ago for similar reasons and everyone thought i was being a bit rash, but it had been building for a long time. it's really reassuring to find out that it's 'a thing' "
"Same. My ex partner would always forget things, be late, do stuff badly or forget to do it at all and eventually I realised that being at home felt no different to being at work where I have a moderately stressful job and manage a bunch of projects. That was a tipping point for me."
She apparently saw the incident with his child and still wants him in their lives. 
"Oh dear. Calling the cops will only escalate the tensions between you. Do you dislike these girls enough that you think they deserve a criminal record?

Additionally, for me personally  I would continue attempting to resolve the conflict and move out ASAP rather than expose myself to the backlash that will come from calling the cops. The cops have more important calls to deal with than mediating your (perhaps understandable) desire to see your roommates get in trouble. "
Clear doesn't equal reasonable. And it's stupid to break off an engagement over something that's likely to be resolvable with discussion and perhaps counselling. 
This is a fantastic and compassionate idea.
Get on birth control.
"But if he's already not doing these things as an adult, it becomes HER responsibility to monitor the chore chart, remind him of the chore chart, update the chore chart, 'nag' him about the chore chart, etc.

"I'm not sure you're actually dating to be honest. You never spend any time alone and you're not being intimate. Do you at least make out?

Do you do lots of stuff for her/maybe pay for things a lot? Does she hang out with other people alone?"
That's not the same situation at all....
"So when are you moving out and what is your plan to dissolve your business relationship?

"That's how abusers roll. They wait until you're immersed in the relationship and then start bringing in the cruelty when they think you won't leave. Best move here is to not try and make him change, just break up before he gets worse. Because they DO get worse."
"Just a guess, but I'm betting the dirt is about sex, or at least relationships. Maybe OP had sex and it will be bad for her if her mom finds out. Or she's questioning her sexuality, or something like that.

"Yeah I got the ""easy"" rumor. Apparently I was having sex with guys in public parks during lunch. Was literally a virgin until my senior year and lost it to my LT boyfriend.

During HS felt very angry and isolating. Now? Kinda just feel sad for the people who started it. 


II agree, don't feed the fire. She'll burn her own kingdom down. "
"Yes! Do not let him talk you out of being bothered by this, OP. "
"The fact that he won't tell you what the messages said is very concerning. You should tell him how shattered your trust is in him, ask again about the messages, and go to counseling. If he's resistant to any of this you should consider ending things.  "
"Well, this is what it comes down to in a relationship: figuring out what you agree and disagree on. She doesn't fancy the idea of FFM and you do. You both agree on MMF. So do the MMF.

2. Your brain doesn't stop developing until 25. In 5 years you won't recognise yourself. 

3. You're in the honeymoon period right now. You say you have no experience - the first 6months to 1year of a relationship are pretty lovey dovey flowers and rainbows. Then shit gets real and you settle into a long term relationship. 

4. Never ever marry someone without living with them. Not just staying together - living. You need to see how they handle finances. Emergencies. Responsibilities. Stress. Grief. 

5. This may be an over reaction but I say this as someone who has gone through this exact scenario with someone abusive; make sure there's no way he can sabotage your birth control. It seems (to me) like he really wants to pin you down. No better way to do that than with a child. "
"&gt; especially if it has something to do with him not feeling comfortable around me? 

its not about you

You never knew the mother, let him have one day a year"
You never have to perform any sexual act you’re not comfortable with. If this is a serious boundary for you he needs to respect that. Don’t feel bad for saying no about this. You might be incompatible in this instance. 
Yeah! I didn’t think that through. I HATE confrontation. I should have just talked to him about how I’m feeling.
"Comment above OP said ‘if you’re that concerned either ask to meet his friends or date someone at your level’

OP ignored that advice, didn’t thank them for it and said ‘I guess I need to wait and see what he says about the FB posts...’ - why ask in the first place if she’s just gonna do whatever she planned to do before posting here?

There are people who come to this sub who are just solely looking for validation of their crazy theories or whatever - not saying OP is doing this at all, in fact that’s why I asked her in the first place - but that’s most likely why you’re seeing people post similar comments in this sub."

"Quitting his job was very idiotic and irresponsible, he could have at least put in his 2 weeks and did some job searching. I'm betting he would have retracted his 2 week notice once he realized how difficult it would be.

 I dont understand why he was so confident in easily finding new employment when he's never had to find a job the old fashioned why before. 

For a 35 year old (really his behavior and actions would be shitty at any age), his immaturity is alarming, Id show him this post so he can read these comments. I'd also reevaluate what kind of man I'm planning to raise a child with. "

It's also helpful that it's a drive for us to see each other.  He lives about 45 minutes from me.  On the one hand it's not far, but on the other hand neither one of us is going to randomly go hang out, hence we see each other a few times a year at best.

And I've definitely been including Jane in EVERY social invitation.  We had a party at my parent's house last fall and she came along.  

Maybe I need to state directly she is invited to every event from here on out.  And I should invite her directly rather than relay to Bob."
"What do you expect anyone to say? You can’t change him and you won’t. You will always be exactly as miserable with him as you are right now. Leave or don’t, but you don’t get to get snappy with me for suggesting literally the only thing you can do to change your circumstances."
"Ah. Got it. That was unclear.

However, you seem to have a problem with lying. If you lie/embellish about small stuff, then it will make people worry you're lying about the big stuff."
"Can you not do it in the shower or some other time when she is not around? 

Maybe she values sharing a bed as a time for (non-sexual) intimacy, but when you engage in sexual activity it is like you are rejecting the intimacy she is offering as inadequate. "
"Depends on the reason. If you want me to stop hanging out with my friend because her favorite color is blue then no. If it's a legitimate reason, like OP thinking the friemd wanted to be more than a friend, then yes"
Rehab for weed? Lol you're silly dude. Or ignorant. 
I'd love to read this one....
The lightened the home comment is really fucking rude. Like now he doesn't have as much of a reason to look forward to being home now that his crush isn't there is pretty messed up. 
"Not really, my boss has a file on her and her infractions. I am going to call HR in the morning as they operate out of state. I was planning on saying that very thing to the HR department. I have the picture, and several nurses have spoken to me about her need to be fired, some even went and talked to my boss on my behalf yesterday."
"What does your fiance want? Does she want to live with you? Have you even communicated this idea with her?

This isn't only your decision because you like your alone time/independence. If you're marrying this woman you also have to take into consideration what she wants. Relationships are 50/50.

If she does want to live together, and you don't - this isn't going to work out. It means your fundamentally different. Do not get married until you resolve this with your fiance - whether it be breaking up or you compromising."
"I’m pretty sure once someone is living in a place for a certain period of time they have tenant rights. You can’t just call the police and have them removed. It’s not quite that easy and usually involves a long process. 

Plus - HE could get into trouble with the landlord if he has been allowing someone who wasn’t in the lease to live there"
"Can I ask the name of the book you're reading? My sister just lost her baby girl in her 3rd trimester, and I am of course focused on her grief but my support system is all kinds of screwed up, exactly like you said."
"I always find that people who say things like ""Funny how you have to have the last word"" themselves are incapable of not trying to get the last word."
"100%!!

Here's what I'd need if I were you, OP. He reaches out to Jane one last time and says something like ""I need to fess up. The truth is that I was ignoring your texts because they made me uncomfortable. When you confronted me I panicked and blamed my girlfriend. The way that you express your feelings of friendship toward me is disrespectful to my relationship with (OP). She's not jealous or insecure, in fact she's completely comfortable with all of my other female friends. The issue here is between you and I, and I should have done the adult thing and been honest. I valued our friendship while we were close, but I think we've grown apart and don't have much in common anymore. I wish you the best!""

Then you both remove her from social media and, if she throws a fit or tries to cause drama, block her everywhere as well. "
"Oh my. I have a feeling I know what you're talking about. 

Survivors guilt is a real, venerable problem to acknowledge. I'm fairly certain your firm will have grief counselors and individuals available to speak to at work. Talk with a professional regarding your emotions, and do not feel guilty for feeling this way. Nobody in the world could've predicted you were/weren't there. "
"I'm not an expert, but afaik transitioning alone wouldn't have necessarily precluded becoming pregnant. 

The thing is, being born male would normally mean a person is fertile by being able to get someone else pregnant. Demanding that a transitioning person gets sterilized makes them infertile. It's not about being able to carry a baby I think - OP isn't able to have a biological child of his own at all, for reasons that were avoidable and caused by government policy."
"The thing is though, I don't want to change for my friends, or even my husband for that matter. I admire how they manage to get the most out of life. I have a tendency to just let days go by as I wait for the next exciting thing to happen. Every other day just feels like filler. I don't really like living that way, I want to learn how other people manage to have fun and be happy."
Honestly it sounds like he needs to change majors. He seems to be sticking to a field that he dislikes and isn't good at because he feels obligated. He should switch majors to a subject he enjoys/is good at. 
"Maybe Allan has an even bigger penis.

Geez, leave it alone. That she made some colorful remarks about her ex says exactly zero about her relationship with your friend."
"I only found her parents contact information when I was worried that she wasn't with them. Her father works for a university so I called his office and he initiated the contact with her mom. 

She talks to me about her finances regularly and complains how she never has any money. That was not me prying into anything. She actually just tells me things about her life, like normal friends do. And sometimes I ask how things are going, like normal friends do. 

I care if she lied about where she was and when she's coming home because she's always told me these sorts of things. A vague timeline of being away with a  potentially abusive guy could point to deeper problems, and he could hurt her and I'd never know because I don't know when she means to come home. "
"I'm not discounting the possibility that OP's male friend is totally okay with his girlfriend fawning over her ex's dick. In which case, OP letting him know this happened shouldn't have any effect on the relationship. Right?  

But notice how so many comments here follow along the lines of:  
&gt; This is totally normal, nothing inappropriate, completely fine, SO DON'T TELL THE BOYFRIEND  "
"&gt;THANK YOU. I go crazy on this sub sometimes as it feels like everyone who comments jumps the fucking gun and tells OP to dump his/her ass. 

&gt;Drunk 20 year old kids, shit happens work it out

Could be the best comment right here. It's a party, you walk into the room, and a girl that is known to be fast and loose with her body is sitting on your boyfriend's lap for an unknown period of time.

OP said others were coming and kissing him on the cheek and hugging him, for a girl like that this isn't much different than that. Certainly worth talking about boundaries but it doesn't sound like he's cheated quite yet, some drunk girl came and sat on his drunk lap and he didn't get a chance or think to push her off before you saw them. Suspicious of course, but dumping over that without having some more conversation or doing some more investigation by talking to those who were in the room watching what was going on between them seems a bit harsh.
"
"While your point has merit in general, op probably wouldn’t be making this post if it was normal"
Do you think this is why she's petrified of pregnancy? Your gf should see her GP and hopefully will be referred to a psychiatrist or therapist.
"As I’m sure you know weight loss is all about calories. So you can eat pretty much whatever you want as long as you only eat a little. 

So have your dinner dates to try new food. But order one thing and share it. Or get something and reserve half / two-thirds to bring home and have for lunch the next day. 

"
No she did not friendzone him. That’s a fake term. She broke up with him. :)
"I agree it's not the best idea in the world but neither of us want to abort it, and she wants to keep it. Her body her choice and I'm in all the way. "
My mom’s first husband tried this on her/with her boss. Yeaaa the two of them quickly got divorced.
However is this guy going to handle an ACTUAL problem?
"What...you're kidding, right?  You're not that out of touch that you think her boyfriend using her computer and her taking it in, is equivalent to taking a pile of drugs to the police?  God...some people on here..."
"Ok. He gave her a picture of him. And the girl, was like, ""Are you like 40 or something? "" and then she said she had to go. That was all I saw (which was enough). Luckily, she had enough sense to end that conversation. It's awful that he didn't have the sense to not start it in the first place. 

I'm confused right now, and I do still care deeply about him. I don't really want to go the police. I just want him to go away. "
"&gt; not shock, not surprise

oh christ, you are right

he is AT LEAST a serial adulterer, maybe often with teens"
"You need to talk to her and figure out if it was her waiting for you to make decisions or her not wanting you to feel pressured into proposing. 

I'm betting it was the latter. "
"You’re only basing this off of what OP is saying but she’s admittedly not very experienced. It’s been two months of no progress. I’d just as easily assume that the guy interpreted her rejection as letting him down easily, and he’s doing the mature thing of distancing himself so they can be friends or move on."

"It sounds like you do likely have mental health issues that need evaluation and treatment. In your locale, is any of this available through your school system?

Your biggest challenge in this is obviously that you're currently only 13. You could try doing the leg work yourself to find a professional to help you. Your mother might be willing to sign off on it and pay if all of the other work is done for her. If you can't get enough help from other people, seek out healthy coping strategies that can help you make it to age 18 (or whatever age of majority is where you are), at which point you can decide these things for yourself.

Given the type of stuff you've been through and the fact you get scared by physical contact sometimes, I suggest avoiding dating until you have more of this figured out. Otherwise, you might be too prone to get very attached to one person, who will likely not be very good for you (as many are not ready to be at around your age).

You probably won't go back to being the person you were before. But that's the same for all of us, as we cease to be who we were before as we grow. Don't expend too much effort trying to make yourself into what you wanted to be before; aspirations are pretty variable in the teen years anyway and even without a major interruption your goals likely would have changed. Just guide yourself to grow into someone who you can love. This will be enough.

If you were 18, I probably would have offered to talk/listen in chat or PM. But this would legally be very risky for me given that you're only 13. But feel free to reply here if you want to talk about something that can be said publicly.

Best of luck!"
*her. OP says she's female.
Exactly that.
"Quite frankly, taking on debt to get an art degree is probably no less stupid than pursuing a YouTube career, especially one that is actually already making her money."
"&gt; I don't understand how this continuously comes as a surprise to women.
&gt; 
&gt; 

If they've been trading scares for however long they've been together (long enough to have bought a house together), and this is the first time he reacted with anything besides ""Woah, good one, babe!"" then of course she's surprised. "
"No, our parents weren't all that wealthy. After our father died we just sold the house and split the net."
"&gt;but I do feel like the third wheel when they’re together and it sucks. 

Tell him that!   Emphasize that their relationship is so close that you don't feel there is any room for his relationship with you to grow and develop.

That's the problem here.  It's not that you don't trust him, it's that he doesn't seem interested in cultivating a strong relationship with you because he has a ready made source of affirmation.

Grammar edit"
"For me (31m) two months with no sex and I'm out. I have a moderate to high libido so if someone I'm dating doesn't have an open attitude towards sex I know that further down the line my needs wont be met. I'm just not the type to think sex is shameful/special/precious/what-have-you. For me and any potential partner it needs to be fun. It's not a judgement, just an observation of incompatibility.

/u/spottycatspottycat 's guy may be whining about being rejected, or he may be moving on. If he's a good guy, she should pursue what she's interested in, and maybe even *have an open conversation* about why he went short with her.

IMO his reaction to her asking him why he's gone low-contact is probably a lot more telling about him as a person than this reaction she's asking about. If he stays mopey then yes he's immature, but he might just come back and say ""i just thought you weren't interested, sorry i read the signals wrong"""
"&gt;  I only now feel like maybe it has been all a bit mistake.

I do think the relationship with her was a mistake, and that may be hard for you to fully accept and then not beat yourself up over... but you'd only be compounding that mistake by not doing everything you can now to: A) end this relationship; B) stop sending her money; C) move on with your life and build better relationships with good people. 

Just don't waste any further time lamenting the past, both the time and money you've spent on her. Embrace this next part of your life with enthusiasm and gusto! Make it awesome. You deserve it."
"That would be the proper way to approach it.  Pay off any high interest rate debts, then invest the rest and set an amount per year.

Almost nobody actually does that though.  Usually when someone comes into a lot of money suddenly, either through inheritance or things like lottery, they tend to blast through it really quickly.  The worse off you were before you came into the money, the more likely it is that it will be gone before you can even blink.  This happens to sports stars a lot, too.  It's not infrequent for big NFL or NBA players to be dead broke just a couple of years after they retire from the game.

I'm not defending her mom, she screwed up.  I'm just saying that screwing up in this fashion is actually way more common than being responsible with a large sum of money that you come into suddenly."
"That's pretty much the only option. I also have some nasty experiences with therapists, but it's a bitter pill some of us have to take if we want to be successful in life. Highly, highly suggest checking out the reviews of a place to make sure you're not going to a quack. And as with all doctors, there's some shopping involved. But ultimately, it's not your problem, because he's an ex, right?"
Lots of people don’t like the “game” part of courtship.
"I have a VERY hard time believing that it went down like this. If she's the one who initiated, wouldn't drunk-him have told you that as his primary defence? Maybe I'm a pessimist, but it seems to me that he took some time to come up with a story that paints him as just a passive member of the exchange in an attempt to seem less guilty."
"That's a great suggestion if OP wanted to go from being on the fringe of this friend group to being completely excluded. They've only been hanging out a semester, that's just a few months. To expect them to always to invite him along and then to bring it up is just clingy. 

Honestly, not everyone wants to hang out with *all* their friends at once. I have a few friends that I enjoy seeing in a group sometimes, but not as often as the rest of the gang. It's a group of friends, not a cult.

OP should just find more friends to hang out with, and just hang with this group less often. It's a difference in personalities, not a rejection."
"Nobody ""initiates"" abuse except the abuser.  There is never an excuse to resort to violence.  Sure, she made a joke that might've been unnecessary or frustrating for him, but ""stealing from him and taunting him"" is a far cry from what happened, and even if it was, that's still no reason for him to have done what he did. "
"OP, definitely take this approach. It sounds like he's going to want to fight. Don't make it an argument. State how you feel, what you value in a relationship and partner, and move on. 

Setting a time limit is also incredibly important. Have something scheduled afterward, preferably with someone meeting you wherever this conversation is taking place. Have a clearly defined out. 

Also, don't expect this to give him closure or for him to move on after this. He won't. "
"&gt;Am I in the wrong for fighting with her about willingly being uninformed?

Yes, you're wrong.

It's your mother's decision whether she wants to watch the news or not.  If she's more comfortable getting information from the people around her, that's her right.  Continuing to badger her over this isn't going to help matters.  If she's shocked by an event that she has no knowledge of, then that's on her."
"I don't see it as a masculinity thing.  It would be wrong if SHE were the leech, also.


It's a good partner/shitty partner thing."
"Youve done nothing wrong, OP, that commenter is being a giant hostile weirdo."
"Honestly, ultimatum time.  He gets professional help or you leave.  You can’t stay in this situation. He is abusive and volatile.  You are putting yourself at risk.  You say you know he won’t hurt you but you don’t know that.  He could snap and physically harm you without intending to hurt you. "
"Bring a friend with you and go have lunch or something, it really isn't that big of deal. I think it's a good idea. Like other commenters said she probably just wants to meet you first to make sure you are who you say you are. Go say hi, and get that initial first awkward meeting out of the way, and then maybe you won't be as nervous for your first date. Don't over think it and just go, maybe she will hook you up with some food too."
Do you think a month is a reasonable time frame to give her? 
[removed]
"Serious question: why is this on you to help him fix this situation? He’s the one who had an affair, he’s the one who should be dealing with this problem and writing advice posts and worrying about how to keep you. This is still very fresh if he’s still trying to “get rid of her” but you seem very emotionally removed and seem to have gone into fix it mode. This problem won’t be solved by getting rid of her. I think you’re asking the wrong question here and should instead be letting him take care of the logistics and you need to be focusing on your relationship with him and how to rebuild that and if you still want to get married. I know that’s harder than the fantasy of getting rid of her and everything going back to normal but at this point there is no going back to normal."
You sound like you think she's an airheaded little girl who doesn't know what she wants and is being led around by everyone else. You sound like you don't actually give a fuck about her or her heart. 
"Honey, GET OUT. You are in an abusive relationship with a bad guy that is blaming you for all of his dysfunction. He's made it clear he has no real interest in improving himself or changing. Why are you condemning yourself to this life?"
"This answer is a bit harsh, but his performance may be pretty much expected.  If your son didn't go to a competitive high school then graduating 7th in his class may not mean all that much in terms of college preparedness.  Did a high proportion of graduates from his high school go on to college?  Did he score very high on the SATs?  Did he get 5s on several AP exams?  Did he even take several AP exams?

The reality is that good universities are filled with students who finished in the top 5 or 10% of their high school class and many of these students will ultimately end up as average or slightly above/below average in their graduating class simply because someone has to be.  In particular it's not because they are lazy or unmotivated but because that reflects their level of preparation for postsecondary education and ability."

"You're completely right; in situations like this, continuing to push won't help. All you can do is be there for them as long as it's healthy for you and make sure they're aware that they'll get support when the gu come to their senses. People don't like admitting they're wrong at the best of times so you need to make it easy for them."
"Can't speak for others, but I can't think of any reason to listen to the reasonings and trying to the take seriously the opinions of a Holocaust-denying, anti-Semitic racist who thinks feminists are out to get him. "
"Not really.  It could be a boy's handprint.  Maybe a younger brother or cousin.  Or heck, it could be on the outside and it might just be a kid walking past somewhere who lost their balance and used the window to stay upright."
"You're right that it is a little weird that she managed to be there a few months and never figured it out. (Especially since you say the other staff know you pretty well...you'd think they would have said something to him about you, asked about your job since they don't see you as often etc in front of her.)

But I wouldn't read into it. I don't preface my conversations with coworkers with ""I'm taken but thank you."" It's a professional setting, it genuinely might never have come up. (Especially if her hours don't overlap with his a lot etc etc etc.) I can't even think of a plausible scenario where there is anything to be worried about.

Edit: It may actually say something about how observant and tuned in with the rest of the team she is. Perhaps she's a self centered air head who thinks every guy who is nice and has a bubbly personality is trying to get with her and every other girl she sees him interact with. (I have met men and women like this. They seem to think that being an outgoing human being=promiscuous. I don't understand how they go through life believing that....but there it is.)"
FUCK HIM. he knows you recovered from an ED and still pulls this shit? Get yourself a bo po boy!!!
If you've talked to her maybe it's time to straight up let her know that you don't think she cares about her grandson because she won't take the time to learn about something that's vital to his well-being. Then you support your daughter when she states her mom won't get the child unsupervised and stick to it.
"This is hilarious.  As a chief surgery resident, NO.  Absolutely not.  The MCAT does not even remotely compare to the step exams, clinical rotations, shelf exams, residency matching process, board exams, and fellowship interview process.  

Not to be rude, but if a student finds MCAT prep difficult, they won't survive medical school, residency, or fellowship."
"Expose him to the very things he hates.

Take him to holocaust museums, to the concentration camps (depending on where you are), make him volunteer in places where he can meet different people. Have him sit with holocaust survivors, WWII veterans if you can find any willing to talk to him. Make it more real to him than any words on the Internet ever could be. Show him how different people are in real life, make him hang out with them and begin to humanize him.

Take him to therapy and find out where all the anger comes from. Talk to him about current events, about art, philosophy, history. Broaden his world view from the narrow horizons he fixates on.

Most importantly, tell him that he is allowed to feel anyway he wants about different things - but you are allowed to feel anyway you want about the kind of person he is turning out to be. Ask him if he, or his younger self, is proud of that. He will say yes, just to spite you, because he is an angry teenager that thinks he knows better than you. But real life isn’t like a meme on the internet, and he’ll learn that - in one year or twenty.

It might take some time, and you might need to take some time, but punishing him won’t do anything.

See if you can get him to volunteer somewhere over his suspension, though you might have to incentivize him at first.

Edit: On the WiFi thing, I’ll ask my dad because he knows that stuff really well and has an internet curfew for my sisters who are actually really good with computers. It’s probably something really simple, but there at programs you can use to restrict internet access to certain devices in your house as well as certain websites and key words. I’ll get back to you on that"
"Holy shit, I laughed reading this but it wasn’t a happy laugh it was pure shock! How.Fucking.RUDE! 

I’d take up MMA fighting just to punch in the throat so he could feel the wind get knocked out of him like you did. 

This is NOT okay, the way he spoke to you both times was disgusting. My partner has said that I’ve put on weight before but he’s never been horrible about it! And he wouldn’t want to either.

I’m actually so mad for you. I want to punch your husband and give you a hug! You don’t deserve to be spoken to like that. "
"&gt; Then, he totally backed down. Said it was actually just a problem that I had with her due to my own jealousy, problems from my last relationship, and wariness due to his lack of being completely honest with me 

After reading this I feel your reaction was totally appropriate, I'm surprised you have remained so cool for this long! She sounds like she loves attention and it is not ok for her to use your boyfriend to fuel her need for attention. He should not resent you if he sees that she was using him and that this wasn't a healthy friendship at all. "
She is too immature to marry. Newsflash! You’ve dated other people and you don’t hate them!
"Yep, this is exactly where my mind went too. It could also be that he's feeling jealous of the baby taking up time that used to be his too. Either way it's a pretty gross accusation. Also cold sores/herpes don't really look the same as pimples imo. "
Jesus Christ that's the stupidist thing I've read in a while.
"Unfortunately, OP, some boys never grow up. He seems to be a bit of a narcissistic person. It’s going to be frustrating, but don’t let him get to you. When you join the club (_please_ don’t let him get under your skin to the point you drop out of your club), just treat it like you were going to. If he starts anything, just laugh it off and draw attention back to what you were doing. Soon enough, it’ll become apparent that he’s the one with issues, if others haven’t suspected it already."
"Christ, it’s like the “locker room talk” thing all over again. Can we not hold men to a higher standard than this?"
"&gt;since I find them quite degrading

It's one thing to not enjoy them, but it's another to think of them as *degrading.*  They're not degrading -- a woman who enjoys giving head isn't degrading herself.  

That sort of thinking isn't OK in my book.  

PS, most everyone enjoys giving head.  Yes, that includes women.  "
"Then go and break his heart while staying with the woman who choose her dreams before you. The one who raises another child and never did that to you. The one who isn't brave enough to talk to his ex about thier common daughter.

I must really emphasise this, already said by many others. SHE'S VERY SUCCESSFUL AND HAPPY BECAUSE SHE LEFT YOU TO HAVE HER OWN LIFE, and then after she graduated instead of stay to raise you, she moved half the country away. "

"It was a letter confirmed the drop of 1 class. Anyone with any clue how college works knows that dropping of one class isn't a cause for alarm. Hell anyone with a clue of how college works knows they send out mail for any number of reasons. She got nosy and then upon reading the letter decided to try to micromanage her son. 

You can try to justify and excuse this behavior of OPs mom all you want- it doesn't matter. This was an invasion of privacy without any valid reason.

Again if OPs mom is concerned about her **ADULT CHILD** she can do the **ADULT** thing and reach out and have a conversation with him without invading his privacy be it his mail or he leaves his lap top open at her house (which I wouldn't put past her)."
"There are circumstances under which stuff does get found by people who shouldn't find it (for OP's job to stay safe). People have been exposed in a number of ways.

Example #1: If she has a medical event, they may well test for it in her system. Since it's not legal in her state, it's likely, probable even, that it gets reported. That means he's affected since they're married in community of property. 

Example #2: Their house gets broken into. When the police come to investigate the report, it could be found (and bearing in mind that if he didn't know it was there, he couldn't hide it for her, and she might not be on the ball enough to hide it under those circumstances, and wouldn't be able to then hide it without him becoming aware of it; if he DID know, he'd be in the position of tampering with evidence or admitting to knowing it's there). Back to same results as before.

There are other conditions under which it could be found, but these two should be enough to give an idea of how it could go down. It's not that impossible. No matter anyone's views on weed, he's right to be concerned about this coming back to bite him in the rear."
"If you wanted sex at some time and your partner didnt, would you beg, cajole, manipulate, and guilt trip until he gave in? Would that give you pleasure? 

Sex is a *want*, not a *need*. People can go their entire lives without fucking even one single time. Despite any folklore to the contrary, ""blue balls"" is not a medical condition. 

Not having sex when you want it can be frustrating. Guess what, modern life is full of frustrations. We have to go to work, classes are confusing, we can't subsist on a diet of pizza and beer, our boss might be a jerk, and we are not owed sex on demand and any moment. Wanting sexual services does not give us the right to trample our partners' dignity and boundaries. Our partners have an absolute right to refuse sex at any moment. 

Biology does not compel anyone to be a pushy, controlling, manipulative asshole. That is a choice. There are plenty of men who respect their partners as complete humans, not simply disobedient vaginas who need to be manipulated into submission. "
"Great advice re: having her babysit while they’re at home. Maybe next time they have a big project they want to tackle like spring cleaning or something.

Also want to reinforce that there is absolutely nothing abnormal about asking if you can babysit. Not sure why OP thinks that. It’s great SIL wants to get involved and it honestly sounds like OP might favor her sister a little unfairly. But it’s in her daughter’s interest to foster a relationship with both her aunts. 

Right now she’s kind of icing SIL out, and I’m sure SIL can tell."
He is the *worst*. Just go. 
I'm on board with most of your advice **except** the lying about drinking beer with lunch. What happens when he inevitably finds out? Then it becomes about her drinking AND lying about it. That just furthers the impression she's an alcoholic...
"&gt; You have to be more open with your new girl friend and less open with your friend. You can't automatically seek emotional support from outside your relationship you have to give your girl friend the chance to provide that and share your innermost thoughts.

Yes! One of the worst errors a person in this situation could make is to confide in their friend about their romantic relationship. Especially about any ""problems"" in the relationship. You should only be talking to your partner about those things so you can work through them together. You should not be giving your friend a negative view of your private relationship."
"You drink *a lot*. Your perspective is skewed because you're surrounded by people who own breweries and bars so they drink way more than you do.

Even if you cut out the evening drinking, having a daily drink is functional alcoholic territory.. your body gets used to the alcohol and cutting back is something you rationalize isn't necessary because your addicted to it. Someone who drinks a ton of coffee can develop headaches when they skip their morning cup of joe. Caffeine and alcohol are drugs. Legal ones but the body does crave them after sustained high amounts of usage.

You hate ultimatums, okay. But if you really think your guy's request is silly and baseless, how about you test it out -- try going one week without your daily drinks (lunch and after work) and see if you feel or behave any differently at the end of the work week. Compare notes."
Mutually abusive relationships also exist.
"You don’t trust HER?! She’s not the person you should be worried about trusting, your husband is. Let’s say they are having some kind of affair — sure, that would be a shitty thing for her to do, BUT it’s not her job to keep your husband faithful to you, thats HIS responsibility. HE is the one you shouldn’t be trusting here. "
Definitely. Cut your losses now And go find someone who wants the same thing as you do in life.
The fact that you allow your wife to dictate whether or not you watch porn and that you sit idly by while she exchanges nudes with guys makes it abundantly clear that you have no self-respect. 
"&gt; Don't fall into the trap of thinking ""I've upset my mother"" as meaning ""I've done something wrong"".

This, so much. Made it into adulthood with a broken normal meter myself.

I knew I had fixed it when my partner and I eloped in Vegas, my mother didn't speak to my for four months -- and I thought it was funny! I didn't stress about it at all. I just laughed."
"You're at a loss because there *is* no way to handle behavior like this. 

I know you want advice other than to break up with him, but there is no other advice to give."
"This is an example of her being more real and more herself with you than with her friend, not the other way around. She’s more comfortable with you to share serious things and is able to let you know that instead of just being uncomfortable and having to take it because she doesn’t want to get too serious with her friend about this personal thing (I don’t know what the story she gave was, but it sounds like it’s something she’s comfortable sharing with you but not other people)"
"&gt;Well, just change the locks while he's at work and let him deal with that

As much as that hits my justice spot. It's probably illegal. Even if he pays no rent and has now ownership the the house you can't just toss out someone immediately. There's an eviction period.

I've been over-weight and I've been at a healthy weight and I agree with you.  People treat you differently and a bump in confidence does not explain it.  It sucks that people were judging you based on your weight before but they were.  It's important that you find a way past the anger and bitterness you feel about this.   If you have counseling at school I think you should take advantage of it.
"in my personal experience as a lesbian, telling a friend you have feelings for them more often than not doesn't really negatively impact that friendship. It definitely *can*, but its not a forgone conclusion like you seem to think and has been the exception rather than the rule. If you tell your friend your feelings and she doesn't reciprocate them, its entirely likely that from her perspective not much will change and you'll have a concrete answer which will make it easier to start moving on romantically."
"No is a complete sentence OP. Is there anyway that you could move into a friends home or a relative's home?

"Also, a guest shouldn't be doing laundry without everyone in the house agreeing to it and the guest contributing to the water bill. (And that contribution has to be counted ""against"" everyone's share of the bill, not just the roomate they're closest to.)"

"I’m about an hour and a half outside Houston, so depending on where you are, I might also be close. Like everyone else, I would love to help in anyway I can. "
"She's a stay at home mom. Her job is to handle the bulk of childrearing and household work. She doesn't get to quit doing that any more than you get to quit your job. Shoot her down. She's being selfish as fuck and she needs a reality check. Your daughter will be in school soon enough and that'll give her some time during the day to do other things. 

If there's any compromise you want to offer, offer her this: If she wants a full-time nanny, then she has to get a full-time job and it is her sole responsibility to pay for that nanny. If she is unwilling or unable to do this, too bad for her. She doesn't get to live a life of leisure while you're working/commuting 12 hours a day."
"You need to make friends you actually enjoy spending time with. If you feel you cannot be yourself with your friends, try becoming closer to some of your friends. It is not healthy to depend on only one person for all you social/emotional needs. It's best to develop a strong support system of multiple people you can go to when life kicks you down so you can much easier bounce back. Also the possibility that your boyfriend may eventually feel overwhelmed/drained by being your only support system is strong. Look out for yourself and look out for him: make stronger connections."
"You're acting like you're afraid to lose their friendship, but you may be forgetting that it must go both ways. If you're afraid you're being irrational, you're not. If you are afraid that they are gonna ""freak out"" over this, then know that their response will inform you of the true nature of this ""friendship."" Don't be afraid to lose something that is not worth keeping. Just keep a cool head when you approach them. "
"I have chronic pain. I'm going to answer this with that in mind. 

To me it sounds like his pain is probably a more manageable type, ie painkillers work (in my case they don't, whatever way the brains deformed my shits just fucked) so I think while yes, its a problem, its at least a problem with a peak of light at the end. 

I think he needs to look at his life realistically. How can he pursue music if he is in pain? music requires a lot of travelling, which at least for me feeling every fibre of my skin is being put through a blender for hours a day... it would be impossible. He needs to realise that music can be a hobby, not everyone is fortunate enough to get to do their hobby and also get paid. 

I know myself when pain is bad, it can be very hard to do anything, but you have to push hard, because it is the life you got. If you melt in your bed, you will die, and you will not have even seen anything interesting on your way out. In terms of his job, is there any sort of disability payment plans he qualifies for? I do, its a huge help. On my payments, I can work 10 hours a week, and recieve 25 hours worth of pay, as well as medical benefits... I imagine you are in america, which will not be as good as here, but its always worth looking and fighting for these things if it will be a long term problem.

I also wonder, is there other ways he can incorporate his music interest into a more stable career? can he offer private lessons etc (really if you can get a foot in this, the pay's good!)

I think he needs a serious dose of reality. Having chronic pain, well, it just fucking sucks, everyday. Thats why you have to fight hard too, and be tough. Because if you don't fight it, well, you may as well be dead.

I'm sorry if I was a bit uh, word salady. Basically, I can understand how hard this is for him, but this is his life, its not 'a hard time' its a hard life. He's gotta be tougher.

"Time to leave, don’t stress about the separation of all the intricacies, you are not the first to go through this, it will all work out, but you should end it. "
"Do you know what ""standards"" does she mean? 

I feel like we're not gettting even half of the information about the problem here. In what way she isn't herself with you anymore, what changed? Why do you feel like you need to see everything the same way? Can't you just accept that you have different opinions and move on?"
"Maybe you can get a loan to buy him out? Another good lesson learned there. I'd be having a look at that man-cave he hangs out in when you get home, too, OP. If he can trash 1 room in 1 weekend, I'm sure it's destroy Ed."
You've never lived with Dave.
"&gt; ""clean enough to be healthy, dirty enough to be happy""

I've never heard this motto, but now it's my favorite thing.  It's a healthy perspective to have about life in general.

"
He has family members added so won’t be “single” he just won’t have a relationship status chosen at all. 
"Same here. Even if the SIL doesn’t understand the difference in regional Chinese accents, surely she’d understand not wanting someone who only have elementary education tutor a child in ANYTHING???"
He's probably friends with 2000 bots that want to sell him Ray Bans
