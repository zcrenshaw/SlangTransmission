Your fiance is not allowed to be mad at you for choosing not to divulge highly personal information to a pair of complete strangers.
"Oh man. Poor dude has probably been worrying about this since your first date. At least he's honest I guess!
I wouldn't see it as a red flag, just a sign that he has a terrible memory and maybe isn't a brain surgeon.  The fact that he brought it up tells me that he does want to keep dating you- otherwise he would have just cut his losses and ghosted you. 
Maybe lightly make fun of him next time you see him (I like the name tag idea someone else had) and move on. Doesn't seem like a big deal to me, just a funny story!"
1 year ago she quit her job to plan her dream wedding????????
"Whoa, those are both a bit more serious than stubbing your toe! So honestly, I don't think taking the afternoon off work for either of those is that crazy. What's wrong is the way he does it - why doesn't he talk to his superiors like a normal person, say his partner is having an emergency and can he leave early or whatever? Instead of literally walking off and getting fired. Maybe you can speak to him about that - not that he can't be there for you, but that he has to be there for you in a more responsible way. "
"Anyone invalidating your feelings is wrong. Of course there's nothing wrong with him being gay - he can't change that - you're not mad he's gay. There's something wrong with him being an asshole, lying to you &amp; wasting almost a decade of your life, and treating you like some sort of human incubator.

I don't understand why his struggle somehow invalidate yours. That's fucked up. His right to be his true self isn't more important than yours. He could hance lived his true life without stringing you along, getting you pregnant, crushing and blindsiding you, but he didn't out of his selfish desire for children. 

Think about that. He let YOU live a lie (that close friends and family knew about) so that HE could fulfill his selfish desire to have children. That's fucked up on a million levels, and anyone who tells you otherwise is trash. "
Tell your husband what happened. Sounds like you both need new friends
"I just 180'd my opinion of this guy. The way she described it, he was overreacting. After getting context, I'd have done the same thing.

Context. Context makes or breaks."
Not only do you not need to tell them the truth but it's ABSURD that they asked in the first place.
"It doesn't necessary mean anything bad. 

I can understand him going on a first date with a girl and not getting her name. Going on future dates being embarassed to ask and trying to get it out of you in really bad, funny ways and then just giving up and asking you.

It might even be a good thing. he might think this is starting to be serious so he better ask it now as it will only get more awkward.

EDIT: if he has a sense of humor, go to the next date with a name card and ask him how he tried getting out of you in the past date. It'll be fun

EDIT: hey, my second gold. thank you anonymous gold-giver"
"""I'm sorry Steve, I know I should have said something sooner bit this is just a trip for me, my husband, and a few close friends."" I know it's easier said than done but that's pretty much the only option. If you tick him off then congratulations, no more self-invites."
"Congratulations; you are all more mature than a man one year your senior.

Your friend is a dumbass, both for being too fragile and insecure to buy a common disposable household product and for expecting you to pretend to be equally insecure so that he could win a fight with his girlfriend.

Either he will grow up and get over it, or he won't and you will have lost little of value."
It sounds like she is wanting more out of the relationship and can't handle a FWB situation. I would personally break it off if you aren't wanting anything more than a hook up. 
"&gt;My husband was well aware of the fact that if he is to marry me, he is to sign a prenup by which he is to receive a million dollars if we divorce but nothing more (no house sharing) but in the event there is proof of cheating, he will not be eligible to the money. He had his own lawyer explain it to him and signed it. My husband is an engineer who is currently jobless and has no interest in looking for one because I literally provide for everything.

Oh lord my justice boner is throbbing. So basically your unemployed leech husband has completely lost his meal ticket so he can shack up with...a stay at home mother with no income. I know you are dealing with immense pain right now, but be comforted by the fact your fool husband has completely screwed himself. All he had to do was NOT CHEAT and he would become a millionaire through divorce and he couldn't even keep it in his pants for that. Good riddance."
"&gt;Then I said, ""This isn't healthy. I'm done.""

Absolutely what we'd have advised you to say and do.

"
"It was your space. They changed everything around and got rid of your things. I would feel violated too. Maybe they meant well, but you have every right to be upset about it when they never asked you for your opinion or how you felt about getting a room makeover. Maybe now that you're home you can make some changes so it'll feel like your room again."

"Twice in a year of dating your boyfriend has gone ballistic and called you horrible things, blocked you, tormented you, etc.  Exactly how many times would it take for you to consider it abuse?

Three? Four?  Yes, your boyfriend is an abusive asshole. You say you don't want to throw it away over a few days of roughness when ""he wasn't himself"" ...except he WAS HIMSELF. That's himself when he gets angry at you, which seems to happen fairly regularly, if you've only been dating a year and it's happened twice.  Patterns don't decrease in frequency they only increase.  

Look forward to more of this, more often.  "
Can you go live with your dad full-time? You guys are old enough to not be bound by a custody agreement.
"&gt;I think it's his not so subtle way of telling me things aren't ever going to change.

I agree. He's 36. This is him. He has no INTEREST in changing. Even your excellent idea to ignore his ""I'm hungry"" calls didn't work. 

Move on. "
"Absolutely buy your own ticket. Tell him you understand that he's still deciding and that's fine. You're getting anxious and don't want to miss out, so you're going to take care of yourself and just buy your own ticket, he can take as long as he needs to decide. "
"Kick him out. He has no respect or gratitude for you giving him a place to live. 

Also, Floppy is a fucking **adorable** name for a beagle, and a dog isn't an accesory - there is no such thing as a girly dog. 

You sound like a great mom despite some shitty circumstances. Be a good model for your son and don't let someone who doesn't respect you take advantage of you. "
"I would quite literally run. for. the. hills. This is 100% twisted as fk, she's got some serious issues if she can in any way consider that a logical argument  &amp; is basically grouping you with a pedophile. What happens when you work with an attractive woman that's your age and has a crush, but you don't buy into it? She's going to always assume you're going to have ill intentions with ANYBODY if she thinks a 10 year old is a threat. I would be seriously creeped out, and would cut communication with this girl. "
"get your locks changed. he could have already made copies of the key he has. 

btw: it is really odd that some woman would not only leave her purse there and not realize it, but also have no wallet or ID inside."
"If your sister is so worried about BIL being around scantily-clad women, she shouldn't be going to the beach. Wear what you want to. "
"That's a ridiculous thing to end a friendship over, on his part. If he's willing to walk away over it, let him."
"If your boyfriend thinks you're so bad for his life, he shouldn't mind when you dump his ass.

The only way I would NOT dump this asshole is if he apologizes profusely, he acknowledges why that was a horrible thing to say, you two sort out the original issue calmly, and this doesn't happen again."
"Plus there's this little gem.

&gt;For the inscription fee, she used all the wedding family/friends gifts

This chick took a year off work to plan a wedding, took all of the wedding gifts to pay for her fee, and still experts a dude with leukemia to sell his life, get rid of his pet, move home, and financially support her. I can almost guarantee that her MBA would coincide with him getting served with divorce papers."
"Stop thinking of this as a ""prize"", don't say ""it isnt really my money""

This was *Employee of the Year* - it is a BONUS, its a performance-related part of your salary. 

Sorry but your parents deserve nothing. It was nice of you to offer anything. Also, any help they gave in the past was a gift: they are asking for part of that gift back then they are mean spirited petty assholes. And whatever happened to ""never look a gift horse in the mouth""? They are plain rude

""I'm sorry you didnt like my gift, I'll take it back""

TLDR: People pleaser: the next person you please had better be you"
"I wonder....have you ever thought ""Well, at least he doesn't hit me""?

If he acted badly the whole time he would never get you to stay.  So, he's nice and loving just long enough for you to forget about his 'episode' and then he has another one.  But, he apologizes, and he means it, right?  I mean, no one would tell their partner such awful things and mean it, right?  I'm sure he just had a bad day at work, or someone cut him off on the road and he got angry.  And you just happened to be there and he lost his temper.....except, you know that's not it.  

&gt; they've noticed where they said he makes small ultimatums to me to make me do the things he want. Like he threatens to break up with me if we don't go somewhere for vacation, or see certain friends, or do certain things. I don't really remember these instances well, but my friends apparently do and they are livid about it. 

This is really heartbreaking that you just kind of threw this in there.  You're not noticing it because you're becoming used to it.  Your new 'normal' of a relationship is someone threatening to break up unless you do something, and this other something, and this other thing, etc.   I'm sure you're just giving in to his demands without even thinking about it.  Are you subconsciously trying to keep him happy so he doesn't have another anger fit?   Really step back and look at how you're reacting to him.

You sound like you have awesome friends that are really trying to look out for you.  Please consider their concerns."
"Your boyfriend is throwing the foreign culture card at you because it's an easy way to make you lose an argument.  My family and friends would be mortified if one of us brought up race to a stranger.  College kids have a reputation for letting loose, but only to the extent of having an older friend sneaking them liquor because they're underage.  Make some connections with people outside your boyfriend's circle and you'll see for yourself how rude they are."

"Saying ""No thank you I'm not interested"" is not rude. If you had said this to the first guy you would not have been rude. If people push you again after the first no thank you, I think you are entitled to walk away. No one has the right to cross your boundaries. 

Saying ""I prefer not to discuss my religious beliefs"" is not rude. Really that sort of discussion ought to be avoided in a workplace environment and your coworker shouldn't really have said those things. 

Sticking to your boundaries is never rude, and it can be done politely. "
"Oh my god, the culprit is definitely your 9 y/o."
"Call the police the next time it happens.

Cal the police every time it happens.

Her mental issues are less important than her not *killing someone*."
Ask to meet at a park....for the kids.
"&gt; one of her friends was going without glasses too and not making a big deal of it like me

Does she realize that not everyone who has glasses has the same prescription?

You're already doing her a favor by being a bridesmaid. Wear your glasses."
Right?? What kind of cirque de soliel stuff went down at this event that required an apparently college educated adult to dedicate an entire year to it? 
"I got nothing. That's weird as hell.

and the obvious question: was there a page for you?"
"So, taking all the advice I've gotten here so far (that I'm eternally thankful for), this is what I'm thinking...

I was originally going to wait and see if she ""drew a line in the sand"" probably because no one likes to be the one broken up with. I've told her that I would be willing to support this but not be involved, but I've now seen that's not really supporting and I can't support this. If I continue to tell her I will support it, that is a lie.

I am going to tell her tonight that if this opportunity and these people are more important to her than me, than I understand and we should probably part ways and not drag out the inevitable. 

Am I on the right track?"
"He doesn't get it both ways. You're not like, burning the shit out of stuff. Either he lets you do it, OR he doesn't complain about him doing it."
"Actually, that kinda sounds like something a hooker would do. "
"Adorable! You're not going to hit a home run your first time at bat. 

Real life isn't like the movies. There's no orchestra waiting in the wings to serenade you and the camera isn't going to spin wildly around. Shit like this is more awkward than romantic at first."
"There's something in relationships that sounds like a dynamic you might have - it's overfunctioning/underfunctioning. In this dynamic, the overfunctioning partner takes on more of the responsibility and stress, and the other person chronically responds by functioning less and less. It sounds like you're sick of this. You can't change the other person's behavior, but you can refuse to handle things that are their responsibility - like the tickets. If you choose to stop taking responsibility for his behavior, he will either fail and learn, or figure out he needs to step up because it's his responsibility and succeed, or just not function at all. At that point, you have either fixed your problem in the relationship or you can see what it will be much more clearly.

Good luck."
"This is the most epic problem I have ever read on this sub; it's straight out of a movie.

Personally, I would tell him before she does.  Explain your side of the story and apologize for the lies becoming out of control.  I'm sure he'll understand and you can both laugh it off.

Sure, he may not be able to tell the same story about how you two met, but the new story he's got is frankly just as memorable."
"She's lying to you, for whatever reason. Who is ""unemployment""? If you're in the U.S., there is no requirement to give or finish out 2 weeks of notice. It's a professional courtesy, nothing more.


The only resolution here is that she's loony tunes. "
"How terryfying for you. Call the doctors again. He needs to be admitted. Call his family. 

you cant possibly deal with this yourself, he needs trained mental health professionals 24/7.


good luck"
Sounds like the boss's boss is either into you or just an asshole.
"Ok, on one hand she's being unreasonable here. Even people into names or who had names picked out ahead of time compromise with their partners, because that's what good spouses do. On the other hand, she's telling you that this name is really, really important to her. So try to take that into account. What's most upsetting to you here,  not feeling heard and listened to, or disliking the name? Think about what you really want. 

I'd go to her, saying ""I know you love this name, but I'm feeling shut out of the baby naming process. This is *our* baby, and I feel like we should both help pick the name. Can you tell me why this name is so important? Help me understand."" Then listen. 

Look for possible compromises: you pick the middle name, or you use this as middle and together choose a different first, or consider similar names or names that mean the same. Or give her this name, and you get to pick the name for the next baby regardless of gender. 

I will also say that if you do go with the name, as long as you don't hold onto resentment over the process of choosing the name you're likely to like the name a lot more when it becomes ""my baby's name"" in your mind."
Sometimes the universe does you a favor.
"Via email:

""Hi StepMom'sName, I wanted to address something that Sister'sName shared with me; specifically that you have told StepDaughter'sName that I will be paying for her education. I have been saving money for Sister'sName's education, and only Sister'sName. I apologize if anything I did or said lead you to believe that I would be paying for both girls' educations, but I want to be clear that I only have the means to pay for Sister'sName. I am sure that you and NewHusband'sName will be able to provide for StepDaughter's education since Sister'sName's will be covered by me. I hope all is well, and have a great weekend.""

Hopefully she'll be embarrassed at her assumption, but be prepared for her to kick and scream. Don't argue or defend if she gets angry or asks you split it between them. Simply respond with ""I am sorry that you feel that way, but as I said, I only have the means to pay for Sister'sName, and I won't be discussing this further."""
"I'm sorry - I have no experience with infertility. That sounds like a real struggle.

What I do have experience with is the regular receipt of bad news.

What's happening here is that your partner's needs are conflicting with your needs. He needs space. He's struggling to handle the ongoing stress of the situation, and he feels that he needs to distance himself from it.

What you're feeling is the inverse reaction, to reach out, and seek support from him. While you need to reach out and share and discuss, he needs to step back and take his mind off it.

Neither of you are selfish for feeling this way - you're both going through a hard time, and trying to deal with it in your own ways, as best you can. The two of you need to understand that both of you have differing needs here, and that in order to support each other, you should probably find some way to meet in the middle and help each other out.

I would recommend the following steps:

- I think it would help for you to find other people to reach out to and share your struggles. If you have a counsellor, perhaps you could approach this with them. If not, I'd recommend that you seek someone who can be a listening ear. Friends and family may also be able to support you here, and help you get things off your chest when he can't.

- That said, I think he needs to understand that sometimes you will need him. He needs to respect that both of you have needs, and that as your partner, he needs to play a part of your support structure. You can respect his need for a little distance, and share the burden so it doesn't fall on him all the time, but he also needs to reach back, and support you when he can.

- I think it would probably help both of you to make sure that you are also celebrating other milestones and achievements, to take focus and pressure off this one specific area. I really recommend that you take a look for the other things that you've achieved so far, and see if you can't bring a little bit of levity back, to reduce the stress?


Good luck for the future! I sincerely wish you all the best :)"
"You need to talk to your mom and step dad about this.
You know what happend and you know who did it.
When will he learn the consequences of his actions?"
"Are you in counseling? It sounds like you need to work through your childhood. Through a counselor, you could also find tips on how to talk to you son. Also, not only would you benefit, it would show Adam that you're trying. 

And I just wanted to tell you that times are vastly different since your childhood. I'm not saying he will never get picked on because kids are assholes, but I think that it won't be as bad as you think. "
"Your sister's excuses make no sense. She needs total silence, but she has a 9 month old at home? She needs to go to the gym/soccer/whatever, but what does that have to do with your parents? 

However, you can't *make* your parents babysit your kids. The best you can do is talk to them, one on one, and explain that while you know your sister is in need, you are too. You have a newborn and two young boys and you and your wife are finding it difficult to complete all of your work without help. Plus, the kids want to see their grandparents.

If they say yes, stop texting your sister for permission! Just text your mom and dad and let them know the kids are on their way.

If they say no, ask if they'd be willing to come over to your house instead. If they say no again, you'll have to look into hiring a babysitter. "

Well do so then."
"Your pets could die if left outside in the heat for too long and she doesn't seem to care. 

If you want to spare her feelings just tell her since she said they were annoying you'll find another pet sitter. If she fights you and seems to want to watch them (for the money) tell her your saw on your camera that she barely came over and your animals need more care than that.

**Personally I wouldn't want someone who did that to my pet to be my friend because they don't respect me or my animals.** The sunk cost fallacy shouldn't rule your friendship. I've watched my friend's dog and treat her like my own even though she can be annoying sometimes. I do this because I care about her dog as a living thing and I care about her as my friend. "
"OP if you can you should go visit your brother see if your mom would take the kids for the night and just hang out with him on his turf.  He is going through a hard time right now and it probably was hard seeing how well your life is going.

"This is not American culture.

"&gt;Would it be okay to ask my girlfriend if Jess could go instead?

No, that is weird and inappropriate.

If Jess wants to go to the wedding, she can contact the hosts and let them know she'd like to come without a plus one if there's still time to add her back to the guest list.

She doesn't get to muscle out your GF because she changed her plans. "
"Three things. 

1. If your boyfriend is mindblown at how quickly you crafted a lie &amp; wants to talk about whether you've ever lied to him, fine, that's a relationship issue to discuss. 

2. If you boyfriend thinks an absolute stranger is for any reason entitled to your very personal information just because they asked a rude question, he can fuck right off. 

3. This will not be the only time in your life that you're asked this question. There are other rude people out there, &amp; you're bound to encounter some of them. Practice saying, ""Well, that's a very personal question"" &amp; then just staring the other person down. Or find something similar that works for you. "
I can't understand what his issue is. People lie in situations like that all the time. I routinely tell JWs and mormons that I'm Jewish because for whatever reason that gets them to leave faster than telling them that I'm just not religious. What he have preferred you say? 
"""Tell me what the fuck is bothering you or I'm packing a bag and calling a divorce attorney. I'm done with this unacceptable bullshit behavior."""
"I'm a 39F now married but lots of dating experience before married so here's my take on it:

It sounds like she thought (at first) that she'd be good with the FWB situation. But, then you mentioned you saw a movie with her. I can almost guarantee that was the turning point and that she thought you 2 shifted into dating. Some women just don't know what they want yet at that age. My hunch is she was lonely. You were the one available at that time to soothe loneliness. In the short term, she accepted FWB, and was able to ignore what she really wants which is a relationship. She didn't intentionally lie to you. She wants more whether she's aware or not. 

Crying and being emotional, ok sure, but telling your neighbors that you treated her like a fuck toy is NOT right!  

Be brief but cut it off.  A straightforward, ""I sincerely apologize for hurting you. That wasn't my intention. We need to end this now."" Or something to that nature.

"Your boyfriend is an idiot.  He's insecure and he is dumb if he thinks a vibrator stretched you out or made you ""less stimulating"".  He is also trying to control your sexual satisfaction.  Are you sure you want to be with someone who is that ignorant and immature?"
"This is basically screaming ""traumatic experience"" to me - even if it doesn't necessarily meet the clinical criteria for PTSD, the deflection, downplaying, and boxing up of memorabilia are all completely characteristic of someone who would simply rather not relive that part of their life.

It's important that you make it known to him that you are there to listen to him if he wants to talk about his experiences, but I honestly think that pressing him to reveal this part of his life to you could be harmful. Best case scenario, you satisfy your curiosity, worst case scenario he winds up re-traumatized.  In my eyes that's not a risk worth taking."
"&gt; I think he should either knock it off when I'm at home or on my way home, or grow a sense of humor and accept that when two people live in a two-room apartment, you might get caught.

Tell him that."
"&gt;Is that childish?

Nnnnnnope. In fact, you are the only one here being mature. Don't change your mindset, you are totally in the right here.

Also, for the record, even if he was also 17 it'd still be 100% fine to turn down a date if you aren't really interested in him. Don't ever let anyone act like you have some sort of obligation to go on at least one date before saying no.

"It does sound to me like her gf is jealous of the relationship you have with your sister. I disagree with the other commenter saying you should talk to the gf.

I think you need to talk to your sister. Tell her how her gf treats you hurts your feelings and feels off and that unless your sister is willing to discuss the behavior with her gf, you're just going to keep your distance from them. Acknowledge that you love your sister and will always be available to her, but right now, this is what is best for you."

"Grab your passport and stuff as soon as you can and what you can easily carry and walk. Leave. Get to the Embassy or an airport if you can afford to leave that way.

Do not stick around. You've seen the writing on the wall. This will escalate and he already doesn't trust you. His controlling and abusive behaviour will increase and get worse. For your safety get out."
What's in this for you? 
"Yes, he is abusing you.

He was doing so well in his message until this: ""*But be reminded it's a two way street* ... .""

He's an abuser, and the moment you called him out on it he (a) tried to make it look like he's sorry and gonna stop, while (b) simultaneously making it look like your fault (*Why say and respond to things negatively immediately when all it causes is a negative reaction?*).

""See what you made me do? You MADE me hurt you by your actions"" is classic textbook abuser stuff. You make a simple comment and his ""reaction"" is to physically control and hurt you. Nope. Nothing you could ever say would justify that ""reaction"".

Nothing in life is ever wasted. Your horrible experiences of domestic violence as a child have sensitized you to the clues. That stuff you witnessed as a kid, this is the payoff: YOU get to walk away from an abuser before it is too late."
"&gt;my neighbors go to help her and she then tells everyone that I am just her ""fuck toy"" that I just her for sex. 

This part makes her seem really unstable to me. Almost all adults would be able to at least wait until later to discuss the issue without making a humiliating scene. 

From what you've written I don't think you've done anything wrong.  I know it's the cliche advice on this subreddit, but it's probably time to part ways with her. Like I said before, outright announcing that she's your ""fucktoy"" to a bunch of strangers makes all the crazy alarms go off for me. "

Make sure you **do not** pose it as a threat, that would be extortion. Just state your intention to call the police and if that doesn't work, actually call the police because this is a crime."
"Sounds like you should take some distance from your sister til she grows up a bit. Be there for the important days, maybe reach out and meet her in public in a few weeks.

"I'm also a shopping addict.

There is growing recognition and support for this condition, even a shopping addiction subreddit. Personally, I've found a lot of excellent support and advice on the hoarding subreddit, since a lot of my desire to acquire and keep is what those people experience as well.

But the first step is your wife has to admit she has the problem and then want to change. Change for something like this, if it's truly an addiction or compulsion, is slow. She may need a professional's help, a support group (online or in person), she may backslide in her treatment.

Imagine you came to us and said ""my wife can't stop drinking to the point of blacking out."" Would you expect just pouring out the beer in the fridge would cure her? If this is a true addiction, it must be treated as such.

There's a lot of methods to help us combat the desire to buy - there's something called a ""no buy card"" (I have one in my purse at all times). What it is is the addict writes on an index card the steps to determine if they can/should buy something. It sounds childish, but when you're in the rush of the high from shopping, it's actually super helpful. It's like ""is it on the shopping list? Do you already have something that can do the same job? Will you use it right now (not, oh this will be great for aunt Marsha for Christmas, or next summer I could use this to...)? Do you have the money to pay for it right now?

But, again, that's only going to work with her on board.

Without judgement, sit down with her and examine bills and income. Show her the debt. Show her what amount is free for fun money every month. Does she agree that's the amount you guys have after expenses to play with? Hopefully so. Give her that amount only on a pre paid credit card. Lock the rest in a safe or cancel them or whatever you need to do. 

Get her the Amazon wishlist browser extension. When she sees something on any website she wants, it goes on the wishlist. When she sees something in a store, she takes a photo of it. End of the month, she can look through it all and pick what she wants. This is what has helped me the most. 

I'm sorry this is so long, but I hope any of it can help."
"He's ridiculous, manipulative and controlling. Dump him. Keep the sex toys.

This has nothing to do with you valuing plastic over him and everything to do with you valuing being in a relationship where there is love and respect."
"Do you realize what else you are modeling for your son?  Hiding from your fears.  Being ashamed of who you are.  Hurting the ones you love (Adam) because of what others think of you.

It may not be the same express lesson that your Dad taught you about hating gays, but things like that have a way of coming to light eventually and kids pick up on more than you know.

I know you grew up in a homophobic environment, and plenty of people still carry those prejudices with them every day.  But, this isn't the 1960s.  This isn't even the 1990s.  We are a progressive society and more and more kids have two fathers or two mothers.

Your son will love you regardless of your sexual preference.  To him, you won't be ""gay"", you will just be ""Dad"".  I'm sure you have instilled in him the importance of truth telling.  So, now it's your turn."
"If it were me, I'd tell Bonnie and I'd cut your sister out entirely. 


Your sister is a nasty, trashy piece of shit. And you know what's gonna happen? Shes gonna keep sleeping with married men, keep taking drugs, keep being fired and demoted and falling behind on rent. 

And its all gonna reflect on YOU. You're helping her get jobs, so you're gonna look bad when she inevitably fails. 

You're not telling your friends about her sleeping with their husbands, and they're gonna really, really dislike you for bringing your sister into the equation at all, when she's wormed her way into their marriages. 

Everything shes doing is going to reflect on you, badly."
"&gt;he blew up and called me names and told me really hurtful things like I'm a ""worthless partner"" and this is why he'll ""never love me"" and things like that.

This is abuse

&gt;They also read all the texts my bf sent me, the really bad ones, and were shocked at how incredibly cruel they were

This should not happen. There is a line that you don't cross if you love and respect someone. This is abuse.

&gt;he blocked me on all social media for 48 hours.

This is bizarre, and it's not how a mature person handles conflict.

&gt;said a lot of hurtful things like how our entire relationship meant nothing to him and that he was sorry he ever met me

This is abuse

&gt;Like he threatens to break up with me if we don't go somewhere for vacation, or see certain friends, or do certain things. 

This is abuse.

But this sounds ridiculously co dependent. Why can't you spend days doing anything else? He just goes downstairs to have beer and you sit at home cooking and waiting for him?

"Yup. I'm a boring, non-romantic, non-white knight married lady. If my husband went through any of the three crisises described, I would be by his side. 

I wonder if OPs issue isn't so much the White Knight behavior but guilt about BF losing his job twice? Also, maybe BF needs to learn to not leave his torch with a co-worker but to communicate properly with his supervisor?

EDIT: And maybe BF needs to learn to not panic when OP is in trouble. I totally understand panicking, but I wonder if there isn't a more adaptive response he could have instead."
"I had a girlfriend like this. She carried a lot of Catholic guilt. There are a couple options for you.

1) Don't have sex with her. It's your decision too and if the drama is too much you can stop giving in.

2) Do everything in your power to make sex a positive experence. There should be lots of cuddling afterwards. Introduce her to the sex positivity movement.

Whatever you decide on, make sure you communicate your concerns with her. As another commenter said, it doesn't sound like your girlfriend is mature enough to have sex, so you should keep that in mind. Her sexual hangups aren't going to disappear in a couple weeks."
"&gt;I like a 1:1 on everything. If I do something for him, I hope to recieve something in return and if it's not, I'll kind of ask for him to do something here and there because I feel like it's ""earned"" otherwise, I feel a greater sense of imbalance and it makes me not want to do anything for him again until I get that 1:1 back

Stop keeping score, this is suicidal in a relationship. You don't need to keep score to know when a major imbalance happens, but calling your SO out on minor imbalances whenever the scales tip *at all* is going to make it seem like you're more interested in a business transaction than a relationship where both sides aim to help each other."
"""You have the same name as my daughter"" is possibly the worst come on I've ever heard. "
"&gt;He accused me of pressuring him into the adoption, that adopting this baby is a horrible idea, and we have no idea what kind of child it'll turn out to be since we don't really know where ""it"" came from. He demanded we stop the adoption process because he thinks it's bullshit (verbatim word he used).

This is going to hurt but you know it in your heart of hearts: your husband is not okay with adopting a baby. 

He was *never* okay with adopting. 

He hid his true feelings from you for an unimaginably long time (THREE YEARS) but they finally came out, and honestly, don't even think about how you need his salary to raise a baby comfortably: do you really want to bring an innocent child into a home with a grudging dad who not-so-secretly dislikes it?

That would be a recipe for disaster. "

"&gt;When I told her I was breaking the lease she called me selfish for making an infant and a pregnant woman homeless.

You didn't make a pregnant woman and an infant homeless. She did with her reckless choices.

"This feels like a power play to me, disguised as a favor.  Really messed up.  It's like mom (and maybe sister?) didn't like some things and had the excuse of the makeover to get rid of stuff and push what she wants her daughter to be like.

Sorry, OP.  I'm not sure how I'd react but I certainly wouldn't just thank them.  I'd make it clear that I wasn't ok with what happened and you feel like your personal space was violated.  I'd be firm but not too over the top so as not to elicit a strongly emotional defense from them."
"I am so sorry you are going through this.  Seeing your parents divorce sucks so much, and having to deal with it when you were 8 years old wasn't fair to you.

You need to speak with your dad about the extent of how it has affected you. Tell him you need him to act like a father and intervene.  This is such an unhealthy dynamic to be a part of and he has to know it.  I would recommend stop reaching out to your step mother, don't be mean, but just don't engage with her.  You need to distance yourself from her or else you'll just set yourself up to be hurt more.

Your father needs to stand up for you, end of story.  Your step mother is so immature it's unbelievable."

You need to have a conversation about this with him, and if nothing changes consider couples therapy. You guys sound more like friends sharing a space than a married couple who are comfortable around each other."

Maintain no contact, move on with your life. 

However, I would suggest letting go of the $5k she owes you. Don't keep torturing yourself by keeping this saga going. She is $30k in debt with no job and no prospects. You will be hassling her for that money for years. Don't do that to yourself. Don't maintain contact with such a poisonous person for money you'll never get back. Just let it go, make peace with the loss (you'll make it back), and move on with your life. "
"Not that booking this many sporting events would be acceptable otherwise, but I think everyone would agree that these are not ""premiere"" events and definitely not ones worth planning a vacation around.

"That made me cringe.  I'm guessing she's taken a self-esteem hit due to the breakup and is saying things to make it seem like she is desirable, maybe hoping some of them will buy it and chime in?

Interracial marriage and people are not some weird, exotic thing. I'm a very mixed person. My check mark is 'black' but I learned recently I'm about fifty precent another ethnicity.

This is not about you learning American culture. This is about him believing you have no right to an opinion. He doesn't respect you and frankly they are looking down at you.

My husband is British and we may speak the same language but fourteen years in and I still have to ask him what things mean or are. He starts giggling randomly when slang terms meet such as 'tossed'. Our cultures are different as are our ethnicities but he respects me and I him."
"The fact that she took proactive action to make you feel safe and earn back your trust, without needing to be prompted, is HUGE.  It's one of the main indications of genuine remorse and commitment, and there are so many betrayed spouses that would give anything short of selling their soul to the devil to have their partner exhibit that level of initiative and responsibility even once.  It's definitely an indicator that this new relationship you've built might be much more than smoke and mirrors.

Thanks for the update, and good luck."
"&gt;why dont you do the master first and then we get married? her reply was no, you come first... 

I guess you have the honest answer now. She had to marry you first because that was her plan to pay for it. 

I would tell her she's free to leave, and if you still want to be with her, accept the long distance relationship. Military people do that all the time. But tell her the truth - you've gone through your budget and you won't be able to sustain two households, and you won't risk compromising your health over her travel dreams.  If she wants, she can try hitting up her family for money, otherwise she'll need to reapply to MBA programs close to home.

The most amazing thing to me is that the degree she wants is an MBA. If she didn't have a financial plan for it ahead of time ... maybe it's not the right field for her?

"&gt;I did have to talk him into it

&gt;He accused me of pressuring him into the adoption

It sounds like he's never wanted to adopt, but felt ok humouring you as long as it wasn't a possibility. Now the child is nearly here and he's just had a massive shock of clarity about what the situation is."

"&gt;He invited me out to a restaurant last week, and I felt really uncomfortable about it. Something about a 26F and a 48M out to dinner doesn't tickle my fancy. Luckily, I was shanghaied into dog sitting for my parents that week, and had a viable excuse for not going.

It seem you don't know how to set boundaries. You don't need a 'viable excuse' to say no. Just say no, end of story

&gt;Lately, however, he's getting pushy, and is not taking ""no"" for an answer. 

He not taking no, because you are not saying no. You are saying 'maybe' and 'later' and 'I might' and 'Not right now' so on. Just say no. NO.

&gt;I don't know how to let him know that while I enjoy his friendship, I also enjoy my few nights off work to myself. I have tried expressing that I am too tired to hang out, but he doesn't seem to understand. 

Say this: Tom, you are a good neighbor and I enjoy your friendship but I am tired and not hanging out tonight. and then don't respond to calls, texts anymore from him that night. If he comes to your door, say it through the door also.

&gt;Also, how do I let him know I'm creeped out about a dinner date without sounding rude?

Say this: Tom, I am not interested in dating you. You are a cool neighbor so let's keep things neighborly and friendly.

Be firm and no-nonsense and consider in the future minimizing time spent with him and no hanging out with him alone. In my experience, once guys realize you have no interest in them they will either completely leave you alone or double-down on getting your attention, so be prepared for him to escalate. 

&gt;But at the same time, on nights I don't feel so tired, it's nice to be able to go hang out with him instead of spending money and going out on the town with other friends.

You have to be aware that some men consider that a willingness to hang out with them as 'friends' and saying things like 'maybe' and 'later' and 'might be able to hang out after work' and so on are signals/signs that you do actually like them just are playing the 'good-girl' role or whatever. So don't say or do anything that might be misconstrued as a 'mixed signal', just say NO off the rip and don't spend one-on-one time with him."
"In the short-term, empower your brother by giving him something he can control.  Does he have his own room?  It needs to be cleaned top to bottom and then it needs to be kept that way.  Clutter he doesn't need should be removed.  Essentially, you're going to have him make his bedroom the least interesting place for a centipede to be.  Nothing to eat and few places to hide.  

Reassure him that his masculinity has nothing to do with his fears.  Everyone has things they are afraid of, regardless of their age or gender.

"It's impossible to say what (if anything) you are doing wrong because you've given almost no information on your post.

Beyond giving us a lot more info, with 40 failed dates I would just *ask* the next failed date (or the most recent one) straight up what's wrong. It might be awkward but it's worth it if it gives you insight into why you've scared off over 40 women in such a short time frame.

""Hey I don't mean to put you on the spot, but I would really appreciate it if you could give me a brutally honest answer about why you're not interested in a second date. I keep getting these responses from women and I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong. Any insight you are comfortable giving me would really be appreciated."""
"Like, he could have a friend (male or female) that's in an emotionally abusive relationship.

However, the fact that your reaction is so dramatic as for you to say

and 

&gt; I just don't want to be around him at all

and to blame him for being ""sensitive"", rather than questioning your own behavior, and to criticise yourself only for ""liking a 1:1 on everything"", which is clearly compliment bait...

...yeah, it's probably about you. And chances are, it's at least somewhat justified.

If I were to accidentally come across the same thing when looking up something on my girlfriend's phone, I wouldn't assume it was about me, I'd ask her about it. Because I don't have any reason to think it would be to do with me. You're assuming it is about you, you haven't even considered any other possibilities. I suspect that reflects the fact that you know that you are emotionally abusive towards him.

I mean *hell*, girl, you think he feels abused and the one thing you jump to is how **you** feel about that? A good partner who knew that their SO was feeling abused would be concerned for their SO's feelings."

Obviously not for him since his friends are supporting him.  He is a shittt person, he even told friends who have known for a while and know he was married to you. 

It is ok to be angry at him because what he did was wrong to you.   You are not angry he is gay, you are angry because he made your marriage a lie.  

Just move on, demand your half of the marriage and try to keep the house.  In the end he was the one at fault for breaking up your marriage.   You need to find your own support group and if they brush it off like he is brave tell them he is not!   He decided to ruin your life because of his secret.  Your life is just as valid as his is. "

Up until thia point i had assumed her first name was her profile name on the dating website. I googled it and it was a traditional female name for the part of the world her family comes from. 

After the date i started to panick. I really liked this girl but didn't know her real name. Then i got lucky. I googled her phone number and previous she had posted her number to a facebook post as a friend had lost her phone. Boom! I know knew her real name. 

It took me 6 months to confess this all to her. Her response... laughter! We will have been married three years this November :)

In other words give the guy a break on this one. Some people are just rubbish with names but that doesn't make them bad people. "
"If the examples you have given (car crash, someone violent on your property and being hospitalised) are the situations we're talking about, what on earth world do you live in when someone isn't expected to leave work to take care of their partner in such situations?

I've been married 12 years, and my wife is my priority number one, I've always made that clear to employers and they have always respected it. I take days of work for WAY less vital things for those. 

Now, should he be respectfully letting his employer know he has to leave because of a personal matter? Absolutely. But they should be respecting that as well, and if not, he is completely justified in leaving and frankly in finding another job.

People, especially people we love, family, are more important than anything we could be doing at our jobs (short perhaps emergency services). Companies should have backup staff anyway."

"This needs to be higher.

What he did was not only fucked up but *cruel*. Almost everyone but his WIFE knew - and I wouldn't be surprised if he's lied to them in the past and said she knows, which may account for their reactions to her understandably shocked and incredibly hurt response.

OP, your friends aren't worth dirt. Whether they knew you were unaware and purposefully let you live this lie for his sake, or if they didn't know that you weren't aware and are now punishing you for being understandably hurt that you've been *lied to* for EIGHT YEARS... their responses are completely bullshit and out of line.

I won't even get into what I think of your husband because I'm sure there's several lines I'd cross (and heck, will cross in the paragraphs to come) - we'll settle on him being a selfish, cruel, lying asshole, who claims he needs to get out of the closet but for all intents and purposes wasn't even in it since EVERYONE KNOWS. He had one foot in there for convenience around his parents and you - and that was it. 

This was calculated, and executed purposefully to get what he wanted with absolutely no regard for how you feel. I am so sorry about the miscarriage, but be thankful there aren't children involved - from the sound of it once there were he would have likely made this surprise leap out of the closet and sued for full custody since that was the only reason he was keeping you around - as a brood mare.

"I know right, all the both of them had to do was walk away from the marriage and they would have ended up millionaires. They never expected to get caught it seems."
"Just got a pm saying ""Tell him that you'll let him fuck you one time to let it out of his system and promise to not do creepy shit anymore""

Thanks to that person for the laugh, and thanks to everyone else who's given suggestions. I've been looking around more for the other camera and still can't find it. Brother isn't in the house unless he's hiding somewhere. I'm going to go wake up my parents now and tell them everything, and tomorrow will look into getting my devices checked for anything he could have installed to spy on me."

"You're right, I am mostly angry over the fact that she has completely shut me out over this. I also really don't like the name; it sounds dumb and the poor kid is going to stick out like a sore thumb. 

I just feel that it is an important decision we should make together, but she just won't budge. And now, we can barely talk about it because she starts crying and having a fit and I don't want to upset her."
"Yeah, your spouse should care about you when you're sandwiched between two surgeries. The real question is why you're even wondering if you're allowed to be upset by this. Is this normal in your relationship? "
"Yes, it is reasonable to expect support from a spouse.   
Yes, it is reasonable to be upset that he apparently doesn't give a flying fuck about you.

How long have you been together? How long have you been married? How do things normally go between you?  "
Add your description of him in the journal and put it back. 
A little bit of discomfort in the instant of delivering the dis-invite will be rewarded by the massive and lasting relief of knowing he won't be messing up your good time. 
"The weird thing about relationship advice is that no one really listens.  In all these scenarios, you tell people what is going to happen and it ends up playing out the way you expected.  Note, it plays out regardless of what you have to say.  It doesn't seem like any of them actually changed their behaviour based on your advice.  I wouldn't take the roll so seriously.

Also, it's kind of funny...because you're posting in a relationship forum that is filled with people who like to give relationship advice...asking how to get out of people asking you for advice : P

"
"Yeah, he's pretty out of line losing it like that. 

You had a (reasonable) expectation that he wouldn't frequently bail after 2 months of seeing each other and he reacted badly.

Consider that bullet dodged."
You should check the phone number of the stepbrother contact saved in your BF's phone. It's possible that your BF saved a girl's number using your stepbrother's name. 
"&gt;How do I proceed without ruining the surprise, losing the $4k+ that I've spent, or upsetting him?

"&gt;What can I do to make them treat me like an adult who can make these decisions for myself?

Your friend is an ass. Nothing of value was lost. 
"&gt; Ugh, I feel so bad about this. What do I do? I'm honestly the most concerned about her not telling him the truth, but some lies about me to get him to leave me. She has become openly hostile in the last few weeks.

It's going to come out. You have the choice of either controlling the narrative by telling the truth, something that should have been done years ago, or running the risk of exactly what you fear above. 

He already knows something fishy is up, even if he can't quite put his finger on it, and he deserves to know that he isn't crazy.

Plus he simply deserves the truth. This isn't some high-level betrayal here, but it's a suspect scenario given the amount of time it's been kept from him and the lie you told when he asked about your friend compounds things a lot. 

Prepare to field a response of ""Why didn't you tell me then?"" Also, consider your response when he asks what else you've hidden from him all this time, because that question will be coming. 

Just tell him. Get it over with. Be truthful about how you never saw it as a big deal until your friend started losing it. She didn't make or want the date, it was always you from the messages to the meeting all the way into your relationship, and finish by apologizing for not telling hm sooner and definitely for lying to him - for which there is no excuse. 

You'll feel so much better when it's out in the open. "
"There are 3 people that come here.

She is grieving right now. Tell her not to make any move on Mike and to maybe get some distance from him for right now. Tell her to keep seeing a therapist. 
"You need to change the locks on your house and not give your parents keys. Then when they come over, don't let them in. 

Your parents have shown that they are unable to treat you and your wife as adults and will continue to overstep boundaries to the point where your mother started a fight over nothing that involves her. 

If your parents say that they helped you buy the house... Sell the house, pay them back and buy a different house. 

The ONLY way that you will be able to ""fix"" this is by setting strong boundaries and implementing consequences for your parents when (not if) they cross those boundaries. For example, your mother caused a fight which ended with your wife in hospital. An appropriate consequence would be that your mother is not allowed to step foot in your house and you will only see your mother in public. Obviously you should support your wife to set her own boundaries about whether or not she wants to see your parents at all! "
"&gt;Therapy hasn't worked, whether individual or couples. Chore charts don't work, me adjusting the way I communicate to be extremely clear is not working either. What can I do?

"Lying to your parents is a bad idea. As you're finding you. You may need to come clean at some point.

"Oh fuck, 36! I totally forgot the ages and was thinking early 20s...jeez! Some people's relationship with food is just fucked. I guess, some kids just aren't taught kitchen skills, it's a real shame."

"I think you need to tell your mother that you need her to still be your mother.  You are a minor, and all this uncertainty and moving around is bad for you.  Also, at 15 you don't need a babysitter.  You can entertain and feed yourself and monitor your asthma. She doesn't need to be actively watching you all the time.    

If you can't have a conversation with your mother, pick your most concerned, reasonable sibling and explain that you can't live like this. Ask your sibling to get the adults to figure out a place you can stay every night. "
"This is just awful. Leave her now, don't waste another minute in this relationship. She is using you. "
They do not. I pay for it through my job and student loans. 
"I hope you'll forgive my making assumptions, but it sounds like you have some defense mechanisms built up from your past. Probably, you've been in situations where your best defense was a good offense. If someone wasn't going to listen to a polite ""Please don't touch me,"" it would save you time and trouble to go DEFCON 1 immediately, yes? 

It's understandable that you would behave this way if that's what your background is. You need to start realizing though that your present is entirely different, and what served you well in the past isn't necessarily the correct or useful reaction now, as it wasn't here. I hope your parents are helping you through this process, both by understanding what you've gone through and being patient as you adjust, and maybe finding a counselor who can also help. Not because anything is wrong with you, but because the tools that worked for you before may be harming you now, and you need to develop new ones.

One thing to learn is that an apology is not a sign of weakness; it's a sign of strength. It shows that you are strong enough to acknowledge you did wrong, without being diminished by it. For the ""how"" part of it, look up the 4-part apology. For you, in this circumstance, it might look something like this: ""I apologize; I realize I overreacted and shouldn't have cursed at you. I will work harder not to lose my temper in the future.""

Good luck!"
"If your BIL is a straight-up guy, then she is insulting him by asking this in his name. If your BIL is an inappropriate creepazoid, then she shouldn't have married him, and that's not your responsibility. If she has issues with her body, that's not your responsibility either. 

This is all on her, she's completely out of line and being some kind of weirdo control freak.  

This isn't fair to you on any level, does she even care that this could mess with your self-image and confidence?  

And besides, what's she going to do, bring skirted swimsuits for every freakin girl on the beach?  This is ridiculous. Tell her to get a grip."
I'm solidly in the #3 category. It's kind of a guilty pleasure 😐
"Former vet tech here with raccoon experience: risk of rabies is lower than you think, but it's not actually about that.  These animals will likely become increasingly bold and could eventually start harassing your family, house, property, or other pets for the food.  They are intelligent, easily startled, and can be aggressive in groups, so an attack is very possible especially at night.  If they get aggressive with you or neighbors, they will be trapped and put down.  If your husband cares about them he should leave them alone.  "
"That's a power play. My dad pulls the same shit.

  Don't worry too much about hurting this guy's feelings. He needs it. "
"It's pretty clear what he used your bed for. 

If I were you, I would put him on blast right now. 

Your dad has no fucking boundaries and your mom deserves better. "
"You set parameters, which I don't think most people would ever be comfortable with, and she broke them.

I'd find someone who doesn't have any interest in sexual acts with someone else and doesn't lie to their partner about it. Would she have told you if you didn't see those messages?"
"As someone will anxiety, I severely doubt this is anxiety and anxiety alone. Yes, anxiety can make you an asshole (I can't count the times I've snapped at my mom or dad because I was feeling overwhelmed) but sneaking things into your SO's food and verbally abusing their father for no reason is on a whole different level. 

Whatever treatment he's getting clearly isn't working. He clearly isn't in any kind of place to handle a relationship right now. I think you should break up. He needs serious help, and there's no reason for you to be his punching bag in the meantime. "
She's feeling insecure because she feels like she's let you down. Talk to her about it. But I hope you do appreciate the attention... if you reject her affection she will be hurt.
"This is a huge red flag. This is not carelessness, it's bullying. Even if you don't want to say to yourself it rises to the level of abuse, it's most certainly a bullying tactic. 

If it was carelessness, it wouldn't need to be paired with the silent treatment. His reaction is what gives away the game: This is deliberate. 

Yes, this kind of shit can esclate to more serious abuse. 

Even if you'd never been previously abuse, this would be an unacceptable way for him to behave. The fact you're understandably sensitive to the physicality of this bullying, only makes what he is doing that much worse. 

If he won't listens, take yourself to therapy—alone—to have a safe place to handle your own thoughts clearly, and explore your next steps."
"There seem to be two components to this.

The first one is emotional. He wants to eat with you, and your eating habits largely preclude that. It seems like, with a little compromise and planning you two could come to an agreement on this.

The second one is health related...is what you're doing healthy. By and large it seems fine, but I do find it kind of concerning how rigid you are with your 7 pm rule. Trying not to eat after 7 is reasonable. No junk food after 7 is definitely reasonable. But absolutely never ever eating after 7, to the point where you're going to bed because you're so hungry and still refusing to eat, is not reasonable to me. This would make me worry about you, in his shoes. There is nothing wrong with a small snack if you are hungry, and depriving yourself based on an arbitrary rule does not sound healthy to me."
"""You don't want to upset her.""

Sorry, but this is a hard conversation to have. Even if she's crying, you have to talk about it. The child will have this name for the rest of their life and if this turns into a source of resentment for you, then your marriage is on the line."
"&gt; He kept saying that he was joking.

He's not, he's an asshole. While you've stayed the same his fitness/body shape has deteriorated so maybe he's projecting about his insecurities and changes? Has he always made these comments over the last 3 years or is this a new thing?

You need to talk to him and tell him this hurts your feelings and if you two can't have a rational adult conversation then you should re-evaluate your relationship with this person."
"It sounds like you, Sam, and Jesse have made your decision.  Roger might be a good guy, but his personal circumstances make him a bad band member.  I don't know what this girl's game is, but it doesn't matter.  It's not your problem.  Time to find a new drummer and a new place to rehearse.  "
"You guys may want to sit down with a registered dietitian who has experience working with people recovering from eating disorders and talk through your issues together. Getting some insight from a professional may help you both figure out the best way to approach your situation. Also, if your boyfriend habitually makes large servings, can you separate them into portions and refrigerate or freeze them and eat them over time?"
"&gt;I keep coming to the same conclusion, that he doesn't like me very much.

I think that's what you need to tell him. Not in an attacking way, but, if you think you can, in a vulnerable and honest way, in the hopes of breaking through his defenses and getting him to see what it's actually like for you. Maybe something like, ""The reason I'm so hurt here is that I really wanted to spend time and reconnect with you, and I'm starting to feel like you don't want to spend time with me, or that you don't like me or my company anymore. I'm not saying this to fight. I'm saying it because I'm sad and I miss hanging out with you, and I'm scared something is really broken in our relationship. Can you tell me what's going on on your end here? What has this been like for you? Why did you want to spend most of our vacation nights at football games? Does just hanging out with me not feel fun? etc""

Like, I want to be clear: what he did was unbelievably shitty, and part of me just wants to tell you to tell him to take his tickets and shove them. It's just that I think that some combination of vulnerability and making it clear to him that your relationship is in danger - because it sounds like it is - is more likely to break through whatever stupid rationalizations he's made for his behavior and get him to see the deeper problem."
"No doubt. And no ID. 

I'm guessing it's a street corner type, not an escort type. "
"&gt;She said she is just sick of not having time to herself, and she is jealous that I get to go to work

Bam, there's your answer. If she is stuck at home with the kids and that's not something that gives her the most fulfilment in her life, you two need to work on changing that. I know I would go absolutely crazy if I was stuck at home with kids, and your wife is too, and that doesn't mean she is a bad parent for that. She just needs a bit more in life, and it's entirely possible. 

Make plans for her to go back to work, or get her PhD degree. I really think she should go for a PhD if she wants it, or she will regret it forever and grow more resentful if she's blaming it on kids. We have a lot of mature students in our department who have children and they are making it work. These students are typically a pleasure to work with as well, because they tend to be much more focused and productive as their kids force them to organise their time a lot more efficiently. Getting a PhD will also much widen her employment prospects later on. She needs to start feeling like her own person again and instead of lamenting over ""undoing"" children, start making concrete plans for her to go back to developing career. It's more possible than ever for women to do that when having kids as well, so with your support she can go and be whoever she wants to be. Good luck. "
Yeah I'd feel pretty shitty if my 3 older siblings had permanent tattoos on my dad and he thought it was too stupid to get one for me. 
"You  have tried being polite. So I think it's worth having another talk where you're a little more harsh.  ""[Friend], I know a little teasing and raunchiness is normal, but this has reached the point where it's not fun for me anymore.  Your jokes about the wedding toast could do real damage to the relationship between me and my parents. I am already stressing about a million things with the wedding, and as my best friend, I really need you to be supportive and not to add to that. Can you do that?""

If your friend tries the ""oh it's just some jokes, it's not a big deal,"" then the response is, ""then it shouldn't be a big deal for you to stop."" 

And if your friend *still* can't get with the program, I think at that point you need to consider whether you're willing to kick her out of the maid of honor role (or the wedding as a whole).  I know that's pretty nuclear but like... if you're telling her with 100% seriousness that something is awful and stressful for you and she refuses to stop, then I wouldn't trust her not to screw up the day somehow.  Because she's demonstrating plainly that she considers boundaries beneath her."
"It might have been a dumb specific argument that led to this, but it sounds like your codependency reached its limit, which is hardly a dumb reason to break up. It sounds like you usually wake up at about the same time, but does he expect you to just wait in bed until he's ready to wake up if you happen to wake up earlier than him? How big is this apartment that he couldn't get a view of the balcony when he presumably looked around the place for you? You'd think if somebody's partner were missing and they were concerned, they wouldn't react with annoyance or anger when they found them safe. If I were in his shoes in this situation and I woke up to my girlfriend gone from the bed or apartment, sure, I'd be worried, but when she got back I would be relieved and tell her to leave a note or send me a text letting me know where she was before rolling out - not getting sassy and giving her lip."
"&gt;She told me that this kid ruined her family and she doesn't want to hear/see him, like ever.

Her precious fucking sister is the one who ruined the family by lying and cheating, but your wife doesn't want to hear that. I'd make it a point of blaming your SIL for these problems, not Matt, and refusing to blame him for his mother's sins.

But to admit that would be to admit that her sister is a scumbag, and that would be admitting that she defended and sided with a scumbag, and that she herself is also a scumbag for doing so."
"He's a psycho, holy crap. 

No sane person freaks out -repeatedly- because their partner got out of bed before them. 

He's literally so controlling that he thinks he can tell you when to get out of bed and guilt trip you if you dare to get up. 

You are right, this is not healthy. "
If you're attracted to him but grossed out by sex with him this is probably above reddit's paygrade. Religious baggage can hang around long after the beliefs have faded. Worth your while to see a therapist.
"I'm not very impressed by your dad. He somehow let you as an 8 year old find out some pretty upsetting details about your parents' marriage (unless that came from your mom), and now he's picked a woman who doesn't value your place in your own family, and he's not standing up to defend it. "
"More than anything, the fact that your journals are gone is a major red flag.  They may have not planned the ""room makeover"" just to snoop, but I feel confident they certainly used the opportunity.  Even if they didn't, that is your personal thoughts and feelings in there, your creativity, and they just did what they wanted with them.

If you paid for the concert t-shirts, or they just had sentimental value, then you have every right to be annoyed about it.

You should talk to them about one of the concerts.  Maybe the most sentimental.  Not necessarily your favorite, but something with a meaningful story.  I saw X group, and I feel like dad and I had a really good bonding experience, or Y was the last time I was with Aunt Helen before she passed from cancer.  They think they tossed some old t-shirts, but to you they tossed away memories, and they need to understand that.

Also, remember, you **don't** have to forgive anyone just because you are blood related to them."
"I think there's a real possibility here.  Boys simply aren't that careless after a certain age.   
Can you see the the search terms in the history?  If it's something like ""naked girls boys virginias"", then you might have to have the talk a few years earlier than you thought."
It is hella sketchy that he describes her as his best friend but doesn't want her to meet his girlfriend. And that she doesn't like you even though you've barely met. To me it's hard to believe that there isn't something inappropriate lingering between these two.
"i would definitely feel uncomfortable in that situation but it's compleley fine to go for a casual stroll with your boyfriend and pick up some snacks! You could even get a bit more than normal and offer it around to his family. If they don't accept then more for you! If they claim it's rude, just say something about feeling faint unless you eat regularly throughout the day "
"He fucked a prostitute in your bed.

Put him on blast. And get a new bed, for god's sake. Well, make him pay for it."
"Your friends sound ridiculous. I guess they also assume that since their husbands have a high sex drive, they are constantly trying to lure away other women."
"Friend is immature. Sorry.

While helping a friend move, a bunch of us were helping her move. We were 18-21 year olds. Some girl needed tampons. I was married, so the girls decided it would be funny to get my husband to get them. I'm all ""he's not going to care"", they're all like ""OMG he'll freak.""...

So they ask him ""Ok, sure, what brand and size do you want?""."
"Now that you know who the neighbor is, can you put a copy of the vet's note on their door along with a letter basically saying everything you wrote here? (They're supposed to be of this weight, here is the vet's letter and phone #, don't feed our dog it has allergies.) Then you may or may not throw your own threat in there about reporting her for harassment. Personally I would not at this time but instead document everything, including your letter that you leave at her door, and report her if she doesn't stop. "
"I don't think this can be repaired.

They are asking you to not be around their husbands and uninviting you from previously planned trips because they all think you are going to try and fuck their men.

Think about that.

Your friends, the people you seem to really care about, think you are the kind of person that would actively try to fuck their husbands.

Why the ever loving fuck would you want to be friends with people like that?"

My dad also had someone on my bed and she left her bra under my pillow. My mom is doing even better on her own without him now. 
Sounds like he thought it would be fun/sexy and now that he's sober he's embarassed
"Youre his maid with benefits. He doesnt want to do more than he has to, because youve always done everything without complaint before this. When you allow this behavior, he doesnt feel the need to change. You essentially teach him that the way he treats you is acceptable. He doesnt want to change, so hes not going to. You either leave him (please leave him), or accept this as your life. "
"I am a mental health professional. He's at the right age to be developing his first psychotic/schizophrenic break. He's probably going to need a mid-term hospitalization. From there, a social worker can help you plan for his care- treatment, housing, case worker....

As for you, man this sucks. You are clearly in over your head. When he gets strange, like described above, call emergency services. Do not drive him. This is above and beyond the expectations of a partner supporting him in a healthy relationship way.  Take the distance, take the time, to take care of yourself. Once you get him linked up, you can leave. Honestly, if this is his first major break, an at the age he's at.....there's a good chance he's not going to be stable for years. like 5-10 years.

"To be honest, I think I would feel pretty sh*tty if my dad had my 3 siblings tattooed and not me. 

Your wife is also quite hormonal right now.

It just doesn't seem fair.

But you can stick with your plan to not get a tattoo. No one is going to force you. The only issue is that you're hurting feelings."

"This was painful to read. Your wife is taking advantage of you in every way possible and cares so little about your wellbeing that she wants you to risk relapsing in order to achieve her dream. 

I get wanting to be supportive, but this is going way too far. Since she's far too selfish to recognise that being in a marriage requires consideration of your partner's needs as well as your own, I think you need to decide whether you're ok with being legally tied to someone who is not only uncaring, but also extremely manipulative.

[Edit] a word"
"While in general I support the idea of therapists who specialize in the specific issues certain demographics face in society, I have a deep, *deep* problem with any so called ""therapist"" who encourages infidelity as a means of ""testing the waters"".  

And, for what it's worth, I think you do need to be told something.  It is ok, it is *absolutely, utterly, 100% ok* for you not to be ok with this.

ONLY you can decide what level of sexual intimacy, if ***any*** your wife has with another person is acceptable to you.  And ""0"" is a fine answer.  You have the right to set personal limits in your marriage, you have the right to have the idea that no, your wife doesn't get to have sex with someone just because that someone happens to have a vagina and you're going to be ok with it.

Only you can decide what's ok with you, but you don't have to be ok with this and ""I will proceed with a divorce if you have sex with another person"" is a perfectly reasonable response.  

edit:  oh, and one final thought. Is *she* willing to let *you* sleep with other people?  And not in the ""well I want to sleep with other women, so it's ok if you sleep with other *men* (and it's only ok because I know you're straight and don't actually want to, so I'll make it look like I'm compromising by saying that if you let me do what I want to do, I'll let you do something I know you'll never do and therefore never actually have to personally confront the ramifications of you doing it"" way we've seen on this sub so often)?

Ask the friend what your wife was wearing. Does the outfit exist? Is it in the laundry?
"Gonna hop on here to agree. I had the exact same thing happen with my ex partner. I studied abroad in his county and got GOOD at his language, which is a little-spoken South Asian language. He *promised* explicitly many many times that he'd help me practice when I came home. He didn't because it was ""weird"" because I'm white. 

I learn about 294848 times better by having conversations than by listening to music or movies. People would brush off my anger and tell me to watch movies, but that is NOT a conversation or interactive and it did not fix the fact that my partner, who also spoke this language exclusively with his family, was not at all interested in helping me integrate into his family (for me it matters because he straight up lied to me about it, but for all intents and purposes the baseline is the same). This matters, and it is infuriating and insulting. 

Some people don't learn languages well in school, and if my partner had told me from the start that he was uninterested, I may not have taken the language because why bother? (I actually am pretty good st learning in school, but for the sake of argument maybe OP isn't.) Reddit loves to make the argument that you are responsible for you and nobody else is held accountable, but for fuck's sake, the BF is point-blank refusing to let her in more than he absolutely has to, will not help with something that comes more naturally than the language he uses, and won't speak English in front of her, which is basic courtesy. She could go and learn Spanish secretly and work her ass off for something he's made clear he won't appreciate or help her with......but why would you do that?

For the record, I broke up with that boyfriend. I couldn't handle how fucking selfish he was, in those and other ways. "
"If she's going to be that much of a zealot, then yes. But prepare for her to take it as you not supporting or believing in her or her dreams or something, because they won't allow her to see it in any other terms than a personal attack.

If you want to try to work through it, you could try putting down some ground rules. Like, she doesn't involve you, family and friends are off limits unless *they* approach her about it, etc. But she likely won't accept those terms. Sunk cost fallacy and all that."
"""Now you won't be able to tell your next boyfriend that *all* of your exes paid for your meals."""
"You talk about your pregnancy like it's just the size of your body and weight, but pregnancy is so much more than that. He could be afraid of hurting the baby. He could be worried the baby can feel him inside you. He might be a little squicked out by knowing there's a baby right there while he's inside of you. Maybe he's struggling with seeing you more as a maternal being than sex goddess right now. Maybe he's just overly stressed worrying about becoming a dad and the impending life changes (lots of pressure to be a provider, role model, etc) maybe he's scared to tell you or doesn't know how to articulate it or not even really sure how to sort out his feelings himself. "
"OP, there's nothing wrong with wanting your partner to actually be excited about being around you. I'm really surprised I'm literally the first commenter to take this stance. It's valid to want to feel wanted by the person you're in a relationship with. 

You should really tell him how you feel. Don't blame him for anything, but communicate your needs and your feelings to him. Maybe he's apprehensive about the trip for reasons he hasn't let on to you, and maybe you need to get his input and compromise your plans a little to make it more agreeable to him. Don't just accept unhappiness, though. Stand up for yourself. If you try to talk it out and it still feels like you're dragging him every step of the way, go on a trip with one of your friends instead. Life is too short for that shit. "
"&gt;  I can almost guarantee that her MBA would coincide with him getting served with divorce papers.

Well crap. Yup. "
"Uhhhhhhhh, I think your therapist needs a therapist"
My eyebrows about jumped off my head when I read this. OP threw her under the bus because he wants to avoid an uncomfortable conversation with his dad. 
"You're underage and he was literally babysitting you. This is rape. You are not responsible for ""ruining his marriage"" -- he did that himself, as you said, he even had a condom in his pocket because he was planning on doing this. It isn't your fault at all and I'm so sorry it happened.

You don't really say what your relationship with your parents is. If you and your mom have a good, trusting relationship, I would recommend telling her what happened. Otherwise, please tell another trusted adult like a doctor, school counselor or clergy member. It's unfair for you to have to carry this burden alone."
"She's 14. It's probably normal. Her body is changing, hormones are changing. Even if you were female, you aren't going to know the intricacies of her body.

She's 14. She probably has to get annual physicals. Tell her to ask her doctor. "
"If your mom was depressed and you didn't know about it yet your siblings did, that makes me feel that you weren't very close to her. Your dad did something pretty shitty to your mom. For civility's sake, he shouldn't have brought her to your wedding and you should have stuck up for your mom. Frankly, you seem more focused on the money you're missing out on, and less the pain your mother has suffered and her death. You can't really fight this, but you could try. Be prepared for the backlash though, your sisters and other family members will not take this well. "
"Be a better role model to your son than your father was, he deserves that. "
"If these are infrared cameras, or you suspect other cameras may be hidden which are infrared (i.e. they're designed to see in the dark), the way most of those work is by shining a light in the infrared spectrum and using that as the light source. Sort of the way TV remotes work.

That can't be seen with the naked eye, but they *can* be seen with something simple: your phone in camera mode.

So if you have your phone in camera mode and use it to look around on places you suspect there might be a camera, you should be able to see the light from them on your phone's screen.

Good luck. 

Edit: spelling"
"Okay so this happened to me - I caught feelings, but instead of crying and causing a scene I just told my FWB how I felt, he confirmed like you, that he didn't see me that way, and we agreed that we couldn't continue. I told him I didn't want him in my life as it would be too hard for me. 

But he keeps trying to get back in with me, messages me for sex, and tells me that I'm still his friend and won't really let me go. 

Please, whatever you do here, just walk away and leave her be. Don't try to be her friend, because she will either think you do want her, but you're just not ready, and it will encourage her to ""wait"" for you, or you will hurt her even more every time you pretend to care.

That's just my two cents. Tell her you're done, apologize if you feel inclined that you didn't see her beginning to fall and cut it off earlier, and leave her alone. You haven't done anything wrong but it would be kind of you to leave this as clean as possible for both of you."
"
&gt;He believes that ""what's mine is yours &amp; what's yours is mine"". 

You got that wrong. He believes that what's yours is his and what's his is his. This guy is using you. Your fears are well grounded. You will pay for the ""privilege"" of babysitting his parents. Personally, this is so far past acceptable that we'd already be done. Tell him to stick his parents in a condo or to buy his own house. 
"
"Assuming you're in the United States. She's making shit up. Besides, you don't claim unemployment if you resign from a position. You can resign from your position at anytime for any reason (assuming you don't have a work contract).

 The whole ""2 week"" notice is a courtesy that employees give and is by no means a requirement. This is useful when you don't want to burn bridges with your previous boss. This doesn't seem like the case in your position."
Then it's time to end things.
"Your soon to be ex husband used you, very understandable to be hurt by that.  I can understand someone coming to grips with who they are can be difficult but that man knew for *years* that he's gay, his friend knew he was gay, and stayed with you to have a child.  That is incredibly shitty behavior. Drop him, drop your shit friends,  get a laywer."
"I recommend this too. In my years of online dating I had a guy call me out. He said that I only talked about myself and hadn't even asked him a question about him. After several dates he asked if I even knew what his job was. I didn't... then he said I came across like I just liked to hear myself talk. 

It hurt. But he was right. And I'm grateful for that feedback. He probably put himself out there to be so honest. But it was the right thing and the best thing he could have done. I now make an effort to ask more questions about someone instead of just talking about me. And it's had a positive effect on all my relationships. Platonic and romantic. I now make an effort to follow all statements about me with a question about them. And follow up their answers with more questions than statements about myself. 

I might have eventually come to that realization later. But I was able to make changes way earlier because of this guy. We didn't last, which is fine. But I was more successful dating after that. "
"Genetics debate aside, maybe he/his mom was afraid that if your parents pass, you would have to take care of them? I think it's amazing that you do so much for your siblings, but I know some people can't handle a burden like that. They feel their freedoms and finances will forever be restricted (ex: can't go on vacation, need to spend money to look after, etc)"
Do your parents pay for your college?
"Do you want to end the friendship? If yes, end it. You don't need our permission. You don't need a huge, grand show of a reason to end it. If it's just not a friendship you're enjoying anymore, then you're within your right as a human with autonomy to step away."
Your boss sounds really great and it seems like he's creating a supportive and collaborative work environment that keeps everyone learning. He's right to tell you to look at things like this presentation as practice and a learning experience! You will get better each time and you'll learn a lot from discussing the topics with your coworkers.
"&gt; I could talk to my aunt and uncle and just leave it at ""cousin takes too long to get ready in the morning so if he's not ready by 8:45 I am leaving for work and he doesn't go to camp that day""?

Pretty much this."
"This would make me livid.  That would be the end of the friendship for me.

I watch my daughters bearded dragon (it lives at her dads house) every time her dad goes out of town....and while I'm not particularly fond of lizards...I treat that lizard as if it were mine.  She gets baths every day when she's shedding, I feed her the gross worms she loves, and make her fresh salads everyday (that she usually ignores lol)...and I tuck her in every night by warming up a blanket I sewed for (that's the size of a facecloth) and rubbing her back until she falls asleep....I mean, my daughter says that the lizard is treated better here than at home...and that's how it should be.  It's stressful for an animal when their human is gone.  I hope whenever we need someone to check in on our cats that they hang out with them and give them extra attention...our pets are our babies.  

I don't even know how I'd approach your friend....I'd be so mad.  In my mind, there's no excuse for not stopping by...especially because this could have been a life or death situation...she's so lucky they survived. "
"What's your relationship with her like? Are you close at all? If it were my sister, I would immediately be asking if things are ok with her and her husband. If she's insecure that he's going to be ogling you or comparing the two of you - that doesn't sound like she's in a good or healthy place.

(And you obviously should wear whatever you want to the beach)."
"Call the step-grandparents. Say ""while step-brother stole the money and threw the card away, I do very much appreciate the card and the gift."" "
"&gt;But my mom was deeply depressed and hadn't yet sought treatment for it, and she often took her sadness and anger out on me. She wanted me to be perfect and punished me whenever I was not. When I was 13, she hit me for spending too much time on the computer, and my dad had to intervene. I later overheard her telling my dad that she would have ripped my legs out of my ass if she'd gotten the chance, and that I ""wasn't her child."" When I was 15, my parents sent me to a mental hospital (which was more like a jail) because I tried to run away to be with my then-girlfriend after they disapproved and wouldn't let me see her.

Uh, this isn't ""borderline abuse."" It's just abuse. And based on the contents of your parents' shopping cart, it sounds like they've failed to connect their treatment of you to your strained relationship. None of those titles say, ""I recognize that I was a shitty parent and I'll do whatever it takes to heal my relationship with my child."" They say, ""How can I make my daughter be less difficult and stop hurting me needlessly?"" And maybe I'm just paranoid, but given that you share an Amazon account I wonder if they left those titles in the cart deliberately so you would see them.

As for what to do, what sort of outcome are you hoping for? What kind of relationship do *you* want with your parents?"
"Oh god. His apology is not an apology, it's a ""you deserved it"" pile of bullshit. Make the break indefinite and stay away from him. "
"In addition to telling Steve that you can't accommodate Steve, tell your friend that she should not give him any details of the trip (address of the cottage, for instance) and that she had better not bring Steve along.  If she protests, tell her that you would hate to tell her and her family that they can't stay if they showed up with Steve in tow.

Steve may invite himself along but the only way he knows the details is if someone gives him the information or a ride."
"I'm going to call you out on your bs since no one else seems to be. 


First you cut her off without a proper discussion or finding out what happened. 



When you found out that you basically accused your gf of something she didnt do, caused severe damage and that she had relapsed. your first instinct is - 


""Hmm I wonder if her addiction is going to be too much of a hassle for ME, I mean I care about her but not enough to put up with this problem thats clearly not MY problem"" 



You dont ask her friend how your girlfriend is going and how you guys can help her - instead you ask how BIG of a problem she was in the past to see how much it will hassle YOU! 


Youre so focused on yourself and how everything is/will affect you that you really dont sound like you care about her at all. It seems youre just feeling guilty but not love or care for her in the same way.



You should leave the poor girl alone so that she can find someone who at least cares for HER wellbeing a little. "

Do not imply that you are fine with it before talking to your wife, because it paints her as a the bad guy. You should be a unit, and she shouldn't be the only one thinking about the well-being of your children and eating all of the blame for being the 'bad guy'. "
"No, if he gets upset, you can tell him that next time he can come back at 1PM for lunch and go out for beers afterwards."
"This whole situation seems like a bunch of bad decisions...

* You should generally turn in your final paper before the last 15 minutes until the deadline, precisely to avoid situations like this
* You should respect someone's wishes, even if you think they're being dramatic, rather than try to interpret and act based on that. If you think they aren't being straight with you, communicate.
* I guess this is a modern issue so there isn't etiquette around it, but if somebody is minutes away from turning in a copy of a doc, don't fuck with it remotely?!? She has no way of knowing if you are in the middle of reordering a section or something else that would completely screw it up
* If she wanted you to edit her doc, she probably should have told you that and maybe you wait for the next day to go to City Hall or something? This part is just baffling to me. Like, I wouldn't just surprise my wife with ""you need to look this thing over that's due in less than an hour!"" and if I told her ahead of time, we would certainly workout some expectations of when I'll have it ready for her to look over, and then she'd tell me when she's done. And hopefully this happens at least an hour before it's due...
* This isn't even how Google docs works. There's no such thing as locking out so I have no idea what's going on, unless you skipped over some parts. But also this factors into the theme if planning/preparedness -- if you're relying on a tool to do your final paper, you should try to understand it
* For the record, actually updating her papers yourself is a terrible way to help her in the long run, and probably counts as cheating as well. You should be leaving comments to help her understand what to do and have her fix it herself...

So in this particular situation I don't really know what you should do. Wait and see what the *actual* fallout is...

But in general, it sounds like this situation could have been easily avoided by some planning and judgment on both of your parts.   "
"I once dated a man like this for 6 years. He was 26 when we started dating and he was 32 when we finally broke up. I tried EVERYTHING to get him to adult properly - begging, pleading, anger, separation, threats, crying, therapy, and many more. He never learned.



When I met my now husband, I realized how abnormal and immature my ex acted. One day, my husband texted me to tell me the washing machine was broken and had flooded the downstairs of our apartment. I was a nervous wreck all day at work, thinking about all the water I would have to mop up when I got home 4 hours later, and how much water damage there would be for me to clean up. I walked in the door after work to sparkling floors and a brand new washing machine already installed and running a load of laundry.  



I broke down in tears sobbing on the floor. I was just so happy and relieved. I had lived for 6 years with someone who would have left water soaking into the floor for 4 hours until I got home and then done a half ass job ""helping"" me clean it up while complaining after I nagged him about it.



You need to move on, OP. He will not change. There is someone out there waiting for you who will share life's burdens instead of making you carry two people's burdens by yourself. "
"Don't go on dates with people you don't want to go on dates with. You're right, a 27 year old dating a 17 year old is weird as fuck. Just stop talking to him and move on. "
"I might try to keep it light in the moment, ala, ""Dude, you're going a little Jurassic Park on that steak - maybe slow it down a bit before I have to give you the Heimlich maneuver?"" Ultimately, I think he'll take it better if you're straight about it, instead of trying to find the most delicate way to phrase it. 

He's probably completely unaware of what he's doing - I know I was, until my now-spouse told me I chew with my mouth open. Which initially I was all ""Whaaaa? No I don't!"" And then the next time we ate together, I was like ""OH MY GOD I TOTALLY DO I AM A MONSTER."" Suffice to say, I don't anymore."
"So you're dating someone who thinks what you do is useless because it's not math/science oriented? He's so condescending to you that you feel stupid? The things you have quoted him saying are disrespectful, like he feels superior to you for no real reason. 

Just because you don't understand his work at the same level he does doesn't make you stupid. He sounds immature. You can level with him and simply tell him that not being a scientist doesn't make you stupid and he can knock of with the passive-agressive comments or he should find someone ""smarter""."
"Your parents holding the down payment from almost a decade ago over your head is manipulating your opinion on other issues, not fair. Pay them back and put some distance there.

He is my partner that I chose, my parents will always be treated with respect but if I have to chose, it will be him. "

"He's gone. We had this big argument. Dad came and got him, he's staying with our parents. Dad said he'll pick my brothers stuff up in the morning. "
Yes. Mostly because your brother might try to pull this shit with her. 
"I think that the graduation story is actually a nice parrallell to this incident.  It's about being entitled.

Your sister does not care about you or your brother or the *substance* of your reconciliation.  She just sees you and your brother as happy and loving and so now she wants that too.  She feels like she should get to have it even though she hasn't earned it.

So what she's doing is this: she sees what she wants, and she knows vaguely about how you guys achieved it.  So now she's trying to imitate it in order to fool you into giving her the reconciliation you have your brother.  She's aping what she thinks your brother did.

I think the real catch here is that by the way you describe your sister, it doesn't sound like she especially wants what comes with reconciliation.  It doesn't appear that she is desperate for a closer relationship with you or even a warmer one.  I think it's just a case of her seeing you and your brother being happy, so she feels like she should get whatever you got to make youh happy.  It's like a kid that sees another kid playing with a toy and instantly wanting it.

The other important thing is that you can't take reconciliation, it absolutely has to be earned.  It's abundantly clear that that's what you'd be doing if you humor your sister's demands.  If you cave to her, it'll just be 2 people pretending to have reconciled, what good is that?

I can see no benefit in forcing yourself to further engage with this bullshit reconciliation attempt."
"You didn't ruin your marriage.  Your husband and your friend's wife chose their actions, while at the same time, accusing the two of you of being ""too close.""  You even stopped hanging out with this person who you consider like a brother in order to placate them.  Forget them both.  

Have you contacted a lawyer yet?  If not, do that immediately.  Also, specifically bring up that you ""threw"" your husband out of the house because that may not have been legal (since he's a resident, he does still have rights).  You don't want to compromise your position in the divorce.  

I hope that prenup is iron-clad and your cheating POS ex doesn't get one thin dime from your hard work.  However, don't put all your energy into screwing him over and end up paying a ton in legal fees.  Sometimes just settling is worth it to get someone out of your life.  

Best of luck to both you and James.  You're both young with a successful business.  You two will be fine.  Just give it time.  At least you have each other for support.  "

Those are the words of someone who is not happy.

Unlike most of the other comments right now, I don't think you can ""trick"" her out of it by suggesting active activities, buying healthy food, complimenting her, or showing how sexy you find her.  If she's depressed she needs to start working on that with someone as soon as possible."

"That is totally unfair to label someone selfish for not potentially wanting to be a caretaker in the future to 2 special needs adults. The reality of the situation is your parents will eventually pass away, and you will assume some type of responsibility for your siblings. It could be emotional, physical, or financial. 

I am sure you will meet a lovely person that also loves your siblings. That person will act SELFLESSLY, but the opposite of that is not the rest of the world being selfish. "
"I would just suggest rewording it where it says you ""do not have the means for both girls"" and specifically state that the money you've been able to set aside is for your *sister alone* (maybe ""in light of our father being gone most of her life"" or something).  

I just don't want Stepmom to twist around the statement and start working on your sister that this means she had to pick a different goal/school so she can share the money.  


The way she originally worded what she was telling the other girl just seems really concerning (""*we're* adding you as a *beneficiary*""...either she *thinks* the money was from your dad, or they're already trying to take control/credit of the savings).

Giving someone drugs without their knowledge is both reprehensible and a crime under any circumstances. To sneak drugs to a person who has repeatedly declined them for health reasons so that you can try to emotionally manipulate her is beyond atrocious. He should not be shielded from the consequences of his actions.

"Okay, let me be your substitute mother for a minute. 

Dear /u/1963_whatsthatsound, I am so proud of everything you have done to become an independent adult. I look around and feel sorry for those parents who have to push their adult children to do something with their lives. I know it's tough out there, much tougher than when I was your age. You are an amazing, hardworking woman. Buying this car is a scary step but you're right, sadly, in this day and age you cannot get the job you have been preparing for without reliable transportation. 

It took guts and discipline to work and finish school and still save money for a car! You really have what it takes to achieve all kinds of goals and dreams, and I can't wait to see your life unfold. 

Ever since you were a baby, I have dreamed of the day when you would be an adult so we could enjoy each other more as equals. In fact, I am humbled by how mature you are compared to myself at your age, not gonna lie. 

Great job, dear. Your substitute father and I couldn't be prouder of you. 

P.S. Don't listen to anyone who tries to put you down. They don't deserve your time and attention, even if they claim to be family. Don't waste your time and mental health worrying about what the negative Nancys and Danny Downers think. You are way too busy for people like that!

"I'm giving my two cents here even though I've never been married or have lost someone yet .  First off, you might need to seek professional help (if you haven't) for your mental state at the moment.  I get that you're going through a lot of pain, shock,depression  and extremely jealousy and that it seems to be hurting how you live your life.  Now onto the issue of seeing the mother or not, I think since you had such a close relationship with her, it would be nice to go.  Say your goodbyes to her and just give standard comforting words to your ex wife.  These are the moments where you have to set aside everything else and focus on more important things which in this case is a loved one dying.  You may also be asked to attend the funeral and you can decide whether or not you'd like to do that too."

Steve is a weird dude, he'll come sit outside of her house and light a cigarette and say ""Hey can you go get me a drink"" and expects my BFF to go in to her house and get her a drink when Steve's house is RIGHT FUCKING NEXT DOOR. Like WTF? I was flabbergasted when I heard this story. My friend DID tell Steve to shove it when he asked her to do this but it just shows you how absolutely out of touch this guy is.

"
"It's time to face facts.

Therapy doesn't seem to have done much. An awareness of it does nothing. He's either incapable of change or has such an innate resistance to it - either way, change is not happening. Your options seem to boil down to these:

* Continue as is. Throw your hands up in the air and accept the state of things.

* Mother him. Double check everything he does. Stressful and not ideal when you want to be a partner, not a parent.

* Enough is enough. Be done with this situation. Love carries people a long way but isn't a cure all.

None of these are particularly great. All these come with their own hardships. Which comes back to the question, is there another way to change his behavior? Other comments may have more insight, but if there's no change, where does that leave you?

"
"Look, it's not your job to assure this grown man that he's capable at his job and won't be fired. Especially not one who is treating you like a total jackass.

I think you're being way too nice here and you should no longer communicate with him much at all. Bare minimum. If he asks to see your work just say no because nothing good comes out of it.

He is not your friend and it's time you stop treating him like one. "
"I don't understand why these other people are normalizing your reaction. I can't wrap my head around this, to be honest.
Look. You might not like to be touched, that's okay. And it's not okay for people to touch you without your permission. 
However, this was a social gathering and I did not read anywhere about you telling the guy to cut it out with the name calling (note that I do think it's not well behaved of him to call you Cat Eyes).
Your reaction was extreme. It is incredibly rude to call people ""fat fucking ogres"". You did not tell him that he was stepping out of line with the name calling. I assume he did not know you don't want to be touched. To add to that, your parents must've been embarrassed due to the social setting.
I think you should apologize for your extreme choice of words and set your boundaries so everyone in the family knows. As for the apology itself, you've gotten good advice from other users here.
Talk to your parents, listen to their reasoning and tell them how you felt. I'm sure they'll understand :)"
"The thing that strikes as additionally crazy about this is that the Padres are one of the worst team in baseball, and it's the second half of the season, so you're not even going to watch competitive play.  Also, (though I'm not a football fan) preseason football doesn't seem like much of a high stakes endeavor either.  It certainly strains imagination as to why he would want to drive 5 hours to see it when most people wouldn't feel a real need to watch it on tv.

This is all pertinent because it adds a layer of craziness to an already bizarre situation.  It'snot like these are can't miss moments in sports history.  Even if it was some once in a lifetime sporting event, 6 out of 8 days of vacation with your wife is completely outrageous (especially given the travel time prohibits prettyt much anything else on those days).  But to do it for essentially meaningless play is just mind boggling.  I just don't understand why he would *want* to do this for himself.

This is not normal.  I can't even wrap my head around the reasoning behind it.  I know a lot of sports maniacs, but I don't know a single person who would even think it was ok to ask their wife to do this.  It'sso brazenly selfish that I don't know if he's like space alien oblivious to your feelings or he just simply couldn't give less of a shit about them.

To me, it seems like something else is going on here.  I have no idea what it is.  Is he the type of person who purposely sabatoges shit? Did he not want to go on this vacation in the first place? You should just sit down and press him on this shit, because it is completely ridiculous"
"Chiming in here to say...don't forget to TELL YOUR WIFE.  Either this delusional nutter is trying to seem interesting to her friends, or is building a dream world in which you are after her.

"It's only been 6 months since the second child, and you say below her weight gain is baby related.  You need to give your head a shake.. she is still using for an infant AND a toddler AND working in the weekends!  She's tired, hormonal, distracted and more.  You've felt this way for only a few months and you are ready to call it quits?  You need perspective, and fast.  Get yourself to a counselor on your own so they can help you see reality. And then get couples counseling.  You can only get out of your marriage what you put in, and it doesn't sound like you're putting much in."
"Say that you kind of feel like a third wheel and the vacation isn't turning out to be what you were expecting, so you would be more comfortable not coming along on this trip. Suggest an alternative plan for just the two of you to make up for it, like a spa day."

If you have not, do so.  If you have, and she's still pulling this crap, well...your options really are to 1) put up with it, 2) call her on it every time she does it, or 3) break contact with her."
"Yep. Insecurity. They're unhappy with their marriages and probably wondering if their husbands will be tempted to stray if they don't get their sexual desires fulfilled. 

It sounds like they buy into some pretty gendered stereotypes...which makes you, the Woman with High Sex Drive, an anomaly and a threat in their world views. Right now, that idea is outweighing the benefits of your friendship in their eyes. "
"No, this is not how ""American culture"" exists. Those are some shitty people and I would consider selling weed dealing drugs and stealing liquor is ridiculously stupid. You do not need to get better at accepting fellow citizens I'd myself consider bottom of the barrel. These people are rude, condescending and trash. Sounds like you're in a very conservative area of the country, or maybe not, because trash is all over this country. "

"As you grow up you will start to realize that the people you used to admire and see as role models can sometimes be awful, awful people. I used to admire my grandpa so much, but now that I'm an adult he doesn't use a filter around me anymore and I've come to learn that he's extremely racist, homophobic, and has enabled my abusive mother my whole life. It's hard to let go of that pristine image I once had of him, but my personal values and morals trump any sort of relationship I could have with him, if that makes sense.

You have a choice now whether to go no contact with your mother, or just limited contact. I strongly advice against just ignoring what she said about your father and continuing life as normal. You don't have to have a relationship with her, you can just finish out school and then move out when you're 18 or move in with your father now. Also, if you decide to confront her about what she said, prepare yourself for her excuses and lies that she will use to deflect guilt off of herself. Stand your ground. 

I know it sucks so, so much. But this is a part of growing up, some people are liars and cheaters and awful in general and sometimes those people are the ones you thought would never be like that. You will get through this though and you will end up okay. Good luck :)"
"&gt;Whenever he interacts with other people, he's cold, rude, and even violent sometimes. He's a big guy, and he's shoved people to the ground just for cutting in front of him in line. I know he's sent more than one person to the hospital when he's gotten angry enough.

I mean, setting aside the fact that he's almost certainly going to start treating you this way (because he will), **why on earth would you want to date someone who treats other people this way?**

He assaults people who *cut in line in front of him?* He puts people in the hospital when he's gotten angry?

Do you ask him about this behavior? Express concern that he acts this way? If I saw my SO treating a stranger poorly for no reason I'd be embarrassed and upset. If I saw my SO treating someone the way *this guy* does I'd be running. That's just unacceptable. He sounds like a bully.

Obviously my advice is break up. How can you respect someone who treats other human beings that way?"

"I actually think the compromise is going too far!  Asking a person to  not wear their glasses is totally unreasonable.  I'm near sighted and there's no way I'd walk down a church aisle, especially if there's steps anywhere that I may have to navigate, without my glasses on!  I'd trip and fall and ruin the whole thing anyway.

I'd just tell the SIL if she doesn't want me to trip while walking down the aisle or fall over during the pictures and get my dress dirty then I'm wearing my glasses.  Or really, either I wear the glasses as a bridesmaid or I wear them as a guest, her choice."
"Uh.... when he said ""no"" to your question, you should've said, ""Oh, really? Because the other day I grabbed your phone thinking it was mine and saw he messaged you. What was that about?""

I'm not sure why you didn't. And no, you aren't overthinking. He clearly is doing something (probably cheating) and hiding it from you. You need to actually confront him, as in tell him what you know."
"&gt; And it sucks, because my lack of smiles is what pushed him to do that, and him having done that makes it so much harder to act smiley.

This is such a crock. He didn't take creepshots of your underage sister because you don't smile enough. He took them *because he's a fucking creep.*

&gt;How can I forgive him and move on? Should I?

No, you absolutely should not forgive a guy who thinks it's acceptable to take upskirt photos of a minor without her consent, which is disgusting if not illegal. You should dump him."
"I see people who seem to find fault w the brother here and asking why anyone would need to leave the wedding reception area and I'd like to mention that receptions are loud. Family is stressful.

"So what's your question?

Do you need me to confirm that your bf is a lazy good for nothing piece of shit who treats you worse than his own mother?  There you go.  Done.

Now what?

Everyone reads this bloody love languages book like it's supposed to solve everything in a shithouse relationship.  Did you read ""He's Just Not That Into You?""  Because honestly, this red flag would have become abundantly clear way before you moved in with him.  Before anyone starts spruiking the love languages like you can expect to retrain a man, you should be *weeding them out in the first place*.

Here's an example from my own life - I met a really nice, funny, seemingly sweet guy.  We got along great!  One time, he sent me a picture of his shopping bag with cereal, milk - and plastic spoons.  I jokingly asked did they not have metal spoons in his county?  He replied that the spoons were all dirty at home, so he bought plastic ones *instead of washing the ones in the sink*.

Now you tell me - if he's lazy on something so small as washing a spoon, what else is he lazy with?  Guess what?  I didn't stick around to find out."
"It's definitely not even going to be a fair open marriage. He will be out dating, actively looking for someone to have kids with, while you aren't allowed to even hang out with a male best friend.

"Yeah she's worried about OP (who is engaged) being on the beach in a bikini with her husband. What the fuck? There will be tons of other women in bikinis at the beach, and if it's a more personal issue about her husband ""wanting"" OP (creepy) then they shouldn't be staying with OP and her fiancé. "
"Noooope. Any one who feels that threatened by sex toys is not ready for a relationship. 

&gt;He told me that i'm practically cheating on him because a foreign object that isn't him is going inside of me. 

Does he masturbate? By his logic, any getting off with his hand or another device is cheating. "
"&gt;Marcy even pulled me aside saying that she didn't want me to 'lure him away'. 

""Marcy, I'm happily married. I'm not interested in having sex with your husband. I'm also not interested in having sex with Betty's husband OR Lauren's husband. I'm interested in having sex with MY HUSBAND. Get over yourselves"".

Jesus, maybe if they were more focused on their own marriages they wouldn't be having these issues. Time to get new friends. These woman sound like insufferable gossips and are clearly shit-talking you behind your back. God knows what they're saying about you. "
"Over the years I bought tampons for my mom, sister, girlfriend... so, where is his problem? I really doubt that the tampons itself were a problem but rather that he didn't feel like helping his girlfriend. Which says a lot about his character.

I'd say, just talk inside your friends group and agree not to let him back in until he apologised to you guys. If you even want to stay friends with a person with his character"
"I have a 15 year old daughter. She would be devestated if I went through all her stuff, completely and radically redesigned her room, and *got rid of her stuff*!  I'm floored your own mother/sister would betray you like that expect you to be happy about it.

Where did your journals go?  

Edit. Sorry,  I didn't really leave advice. If your mom is generally reasonable (though she doesn't sound like she is) and you can talk to her I suggest approaching her about it gently. Maybe something like;

&gt;I appreciate the hard work and effort you put into redesigning my room. I feel as though my personal space has been violated in my absence and I especially feel betrayed and hurt that you got rid of some of my stuff. 

If she is a complete selfish loon (based on her actions and reactions this seems more likely), then I'm so sorry. Look for something positive to hold onto mentally while quietly planning how you can move out on your 18th birthday. It's only 3 years from now."
"At least you figured out that she's a sucker with no common sense before you married her, or she would have dumped your money into that shithole along with hers. Those things are total scams that will bleed you dry."

"Does it show times in the history you can match up? 

You know you don't even consider your nine year old...

My friend was having me do something on her computer when I had to go to the history because I closed a tab I needed. I found lots of porn... her ten year old and the ten year olds friend were watching and being curious. Your son is adamant even with you saying it's not a big deal... yet you keep pegging him. But his sister is a real possibility!"
"Yikes, I'd be super annoyed too.  Maybe your boyfriend could have a delicate heart to heart with his mother clearing stating that you both are looking to spread your wings and are excited at the new beginning, new city by yourselves."
"This is a tough situation; he could just be an older, lonely guy with a poor sense of boundaries/social etiquette. He could also be a creep who is interested in you and sees his chance to move in on you now that your bf is out of the picture.

We'll start by assuming it's the former, but preparing for the latter.

The next time he's insistent/inappropriate (knocks on your door, pushes you to make plans, etc) I would tell him something like this, be it in person or via text/phone:

""Tom, I've enjoyed spending time with you as a neighbor and a friend. That being said, I am very busy, and I'm at a difficult point in my life right now. I need you to understand that when you do things like (insert behaviors here/text me constantly/knock on my door/approach me when you know I'm home/become insistent or pushy about hanging out/etc) it makes me feel uncomfortable, and it is causing me stress. I don't mean to be rude, but this is my home, and my sanctuary. I like having control over who I see and when, and that goes for everyone in my life: all my friends, family and acquaintances. Just because we are neighbors and you see that I am home does mean that you should knock on my door, call me, or try to hang out with me. This behavior is making me uncomfortable and I think that we need to establish that, moving forward, I will reach out to you if I would like to socialize. Please do not contact me every time you see me coming home: my presence in my home is not an invitation to socialize, and again, it is making me uncomfortable. Most of the time I want to relax and take care of the things on my plate when I come home. I feel pressured by you to spend more time with you than I am comfortable with at this point. Again, I mean no hard feelings, but I simply need more space.""

If he's a reasonable person who just lacks awareness, he'll likely be a bit surprised, slightly hurt, and really ashamed, and that should be the end of it.

If he gets angry, really upset, or continues the behavior despite you expressly telling him your feelings on the matter, then he's officially a creep and you need to start protecting yourself and taking measures for safety (start documenting his attempts to reach out to you via text/phone/email, consider a security system/cameras, call someone immediately if you see him approaching you/he comes to your door so you can ask for help, etc) and then contact the police to begin a paperwork trail if the stalking behavior (ie showing up at your door) continues, and tell him that your friendship is not working since he cannot respect boundaries and you no longer want him to contact you."
"I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

"I wanna know who's in a relationship with this guy, you or your friend? Did you consider that maybe she's jealous or liked the guy before and can't accept that you're together? She's working so hard to jeopardize what you have going with this guy and honestly I wouldn't feel comfortable if my friend keeps intervening in my life like this. You're an adult and you know what's good for you. You seem to enjoy your relationship so why care about her opinion. I say you politely ask this friend so un-stick her nose in your business."
"Tell your friend no and then don't discuss it again. If she pushes the issue then spend less time with this friend. Call her out on her crappy behaviour. 

If you don't want to go nuclear saying something like : wow, that came out as really selfish. What you just said was that i should send my bf who needs surgery and bedrest to your kids birthday party. Lol. "
"How nice of her to remind you to block her texts, too."
"Here is how I explained it to family when my oldest (MTF) came out as trans. ""We have some news about Jack. He has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. That means his body is male and his brain is female. In layman terms, he is transgender. If you are interested in the science of it, there is a difference in the sexually dimorphic nucleus in the brain; it is not just a feeling. From now on we will be using ""she/her"" and ""daughter/sister"". She has chosen the name Jane. This is not bad news, we are not sad or ashamed. In fact, we are very happy and excited for this next part of Jane's life to get started.""

It felt like I gave a little speech, and some people were really shocked and speechless. But I kept talking, probably repeated myself, and they caught up. Personally, I like using the phrase ""medical diagnosis"" because it is not just about feelings, but I know that is a controversial statement. I think that feelings can be changed or maybe made to go away, whereas your fundamental identity can't. There is also some controversy about saying she had a male body, but it was the best we could do at the time. I don't think our family was into the nuance of transgender issues enough to know that ""some boys have penises and some boys have vaginas."" 

My youngest was 12 when my oldest came out, and he was fine. The cousins were 7 and 13, and they were fine. I think your brother will get it faster than the adults. Just keep it simple. Then tell him he can ask you questions, even if they are weird or embarrassing. But don't be afraid to say, ""I am not comfortable answering that right now.""

Good luck! I wish you the best. And hug your sister extra tight. "
I mean it's either his home too or it isn't.   If he cant have any say or contribution to the place perhaps it's better the two of you don't live together.
"""I am sorry I used bad language"" should be enough. That dude was out of line. It's bad enough to put you in an uncomfortable situation where you don't know anyone let alone around drunk assholes."
"This is sketchy as fuck.  She obviously still has feelings for him or wants to keep him on the side in case nothing better comes along.  The fact that he is willing to go along with this is bad news.  If they were just friends it wouldn't be an issue.  Hell, she should *want* to meet you. "
"I lost my husband to a drunk driver. He was stationary at a red light and the drunk rear ended him at such a speed it flipped my husband's car and killed him. The drunk walked away with some bruises. The drunk was only 22, he has now killed someone, will spend 10 years in jail, and did not have any kind of record before this. 

Call the cops! Every single time. A DUI is much less than vehicular homicide or death. You are being a truer friend by putting a stop to this. You don't have to tell her it is you. Actually, I wouldn't so that you can keep calling the cops if she doesn't learn. "

"Did this and they've got his phone and laptop now. Haven't looked at them, waiting for advice when the cops get here."
"Wow I am definitely new to this, the comments are pretty unanimous and I feel ridiculous for not realizing the obvious thing is to call the cops. Thank you and to everyone else for commenting so quickly. 

Okay, so I just have to make sure that when this happens I have to keep it a secret for ever, right? I don't think she would ever see it any other way than true and utter betrayal from her closest friend. "
"Even if you did say ""as many sports as you want"" (lol come on), it would *atill* be super selfish to actually book the majority of the trip up with sports events. You both knew it was meant to be a romantic trip. You're not as into sports. He's being super selfish. This vacation is *not* just for him. 

He needs to refund/ sell the majority of those tickets. What he did was thoughtless and ridiculous. He can return most tickets and native you can agree he can go alone to another sports event in addition to the game you'll both attend. Then you both have a day or evening alone, but the trip still focuses on your marriage. "
"Not to be rude, but this post made me want to facepalm myself. This is why FWB is risky. You catch feelings and your particular feeling was that of jealousy. Did you and Brad ever have the conversation of being exclusive FWB for a set period of time? I'm thinking not. Maybe it's time to stop the FWB with him from now on. "
"&gt;It never even crossed his mind that I would ever be frustrated enough to go. He said that several times. That he always thought there was ""always tomorrow"" to make things better.

UGH. Basically ""I fully recognized my behavior was causing you to be  unhappy, but I didn't think it was so bad for me to need to do anything about it and that you'd stick around anyway!""

The fact that he admits this to you is mind-boggling, and shows how selfish he really was. 

Good on you for being one hundred percent on top of this situation, and realizing how much better you can do. Have a great rest of your vacation!"
"&gt; I feel like I wouldn't be dealing with this if I weren't with such a sensitive guy. 

I feel like this is all we need to see."
"Yes, it sounds like he cheated. 


If someone told my boyfriend I had nudes on my phone, I'd honestly hand him my phone immediately to search it, and we have a ""don't go near each other's phone"" policy. But I'd offer immediately to prove my innocence! 

Cheating aside, you drew a boundary with this other girl and he's repeatedly broken it. That's betraying you at the very least, if not cheating.

"I don't understand how people are saying it's your fault because your wife has always been into baby naming, so you need to suck it up with a crap name. It's your daughter as much as it is hers, it's not fair what she is doing. If she wanted to take unilateral decisions regarding her future kids she had better stay single and use a donor honestly.

I think your wife is 100% in the wrong. It's not her baby, it's her baby AND yours. I am afraid this is the first of many unilateral decisions she will take regarding your daughter. And I am afraid there isn't much you can do here but brace yourself for being a passive spectator, now and potentially in the future. This type of entitlement seldom goes away."
"And when you tell your father, *do not* throw your wife under the bus. It isn't 'My wife thinks it's a bad idea.', it's 'I don't think it's a good idea.' or maybe '*We* don't think it's a good idea.'

It would probably be best if it was just you, though, since you're his son. It is far too easy for the in-laws to latch all blame onto the spouse."

After nearly 30 years in the professional workforce rest assured you will run into plenty more prior to your retirement. Heck, when I worked on Wall Street these assholes were a dime-a-dozen!    

Bottom line: don't let him bother you and avoid, avoid, avoid. If it gets to be too much look for another job and quit."
Can you just say your on medication for something to try and help you get pregnant and therefore can't drink? It's not saying you are pregnant. I get not wanting to tell peeps. I'm 12 weeks and still scared. Makes it too real and what if something goes wrong. Fertility is rough.  Good luck!

She's telling him to be more confident, be more assertive in his cheating, because she is. She's helping him think of ways to lie to his fiancee in order to see her, which is what she's used to doing with you. Lying, ""wearing the pants"", bucking it up and making up stories and playing on your good faith in order to have her affair. She's proud of her can-do attitude when it comes to making this affair happen. She knows she can stay out until 8, or ""work late"" whenever she needs to, because you're reliable, you're trustworthy, you'll be there with your kid taking care of things. 

Of course she's sorry. Liars are always sorry when they get caught. She's embarrassed and proud and doesn't want anyone to know what she's done, so she hasn't told her family either. No doubt she's relying on your good will, steadfastness, and general reliability, hoping you'll forgive and forget.

There's absolutely no chance they didn't sleep together - ""I'm dying for you right now"". Seems like the boss is the more reticent one in this situation, which is saying something since you don't speak highly of his character. Them sleeping together isn't your biggest problem here - your biggest issue is that this woman is a manipulator and this was very, very premeditated. 

You're making your life happen on your own already - you're a great dad and run the home in large part and have a great job (nice of her to remind you your job isn't as ""mentally challenging"" as hers, by the way). I'd say this is a good opportunity for you to ""wear the pants"" and get on with your life. I hope you'll someday meet an honest, decent person to share it with. "
"""Sorry, I can't afford to pay for that. I'm in a committed relationship and part of that is sometimes splitting family time. This year we're going to be with her family for the holiday. I'll be out to see you at [Easter or insert holiday here]."" "
"Plus - OP didn't file for unemployment, so there's no reason for them to reach out.

Also - when you press someone for information and they give you bullshit answers (""Oh I wasn't even supposed to tell you!"") it's a good indication they are lying."
You guys need to get into couples therapy ASAP
you're in a crazy amount of denial. good luck.
"&gt;My wife is a drug addict ...My wife went to jail a couple times. Maybe this has something to do with it. You can't imagine how awful it is to see the mother of your children ruin herself with drugs and even threaten your own daughter's lives! I should have gotten a divorce, but I knew that the kids needed a mother and I thought the right thing would be to stick to my vows like my father before me. 

So, in other words, you taught your oldest daughter that:

a) certain behaviors, like drug abuse, verbal abuse, emotional abuse, are completely acceptable in a partner,

b) that once you decide to stay with someone, you never leave them no matter how bad it gets,

c) that loved ones and family members are allowed to abuse you and treat you terribly, without consequence, 

d) that ""sticking to your vows/promises"" is more important that your safety or the safety and happiness of your loved ones....

Your daughter is following the relationship model you set out for her.  Your relationship with her mother, and her relationship with her mother, is the guide she is using for *her* relationships.

She needs therapy.  Badly.  "
"Can I suggest PFLAG, and maybe some family counselling. This isn't fair to you, or your kid, or your partner. "
"The moment she's old enough to understand that the tattoo is of her sibling's names, the first question out of her mouth will be ""Where's my name?"""
"Because then see, everything worked out fine, just relax, and her point will be moot. 

She'd be reinforcing his lazy behavior."
"You're the first person I've ever ""met"" who has a worse prescription than me. -8.5 R, -9.5 L.  Congratulations!

Like legit one of my biggest fears is having the house catch on fire at night when my contacts are out, and subsequently knocking my glasses off the nightstand.  I'd just have to tuck myself back into bed and be like ""welp, that's over.""
"
"Does your wife have a support network of friends or other family nearby, or a counselor she can go to on short notice?  If there is a friend/family member you would feel comfortable contacting to go check on her, you might even do that.  I realize those options may not be available to you/her, but if they are, now is the time to use them. If they aren't, then maybe that is what you two need to look into shoring up going forward. "
"I think that's really disgusting too, I'm shocked that he didn't even attempt to clean it up before having you in his car. The fact that he's okay with that level of filth leads me to believe he keeps his house the same way."
"Agreed. Don't fight for this. It's not worth it. 

Also if a dude wants to experience the fun parts of my vagina, he's better be ready to acknowledge the less fun parts. We don't control our periods, they suck but it happens so deal. "
"All hope is not lost. The last paragraph shows the foundation of love and a healthy relationship is there. You aren't dealing with a malicious, careless, bad partner. It just sounds like the responsibilities and pressure of raising a child has distracted you from one another.

Marriage counseling may be a good idea, and so would a vacation with just you two. "
[removed]
"I get what you're saying. It's just that OP describes them as ""terrible burn marks up and down my arm."" If people aren't aware of self-harming, then they would have to imagine the burns were a result of OP being in a fire or something, right? Like do they expect OP to regale them with her tale of benign on fire at some point in her life?"
"&gt; I even made up some clear lies, like they'd ask how long we'd been together, and I'd be like ""I'm not sure, maybe a year""  

Buddy... what?"
"It's super inappropriate for a cashier to ask that about you to begin with. There was absolutely no need for you to share your dark past, and I totally understand why you just made up a story. Why on earth would your fiance think that perfect strangers are entitled to know about your self-harming past? "
"Now that you know the situation, just bring food to share. Pack your bag and then bring a big grocery sack full of chips and brownies or whatever you want. Smuggle a package of oreos in your suitcase. Bring a cooler full of whatever. Hell, don't even hide it. Say something to the effect of ""You guys were so nice to invite me with you, I thought I'd chip in by bringing some food to share!"""
"I might be a little late to this, but I think my story is important. 


January 12th, 2017, my only biological sister was killed on her 21st birthday. She was partying because it was her birthday! The big 21. And she trusted her driver to be responsible and not drive under the influence. Well he wasn't. He was drunk and decided to drive my sister. He ended up speeding, and crashing his truck. The truck caught fire. The bastard didn't even try to help her out of it because he was so fucked up. My sister and another person, a guy who had his own family, even a baby on the way, were killed in the accident. 

She was my older sister, only by 18 months. We just hit the six month mark two days ago and it still hurts as much as it did the first day. My mom is terrified of driving now, I'm scared of being in the car. My birthday is tomorrow and I'm not celebrating it because why should I? She couldn't celebrate hers because this asshole killed her in the process. People keep asking me what I want for my birthday, and all I want is to talk to her again. 

Chelsea was this incredibly kind, funny, and beautiful girl. She had issues with drugs, but wanted to get clean so she could help others get better. She loved animals so instead of flowers for her, we had people donate to the SPCA. 

I miss her every fucking day. I miss her so much that it hurts to breathe. I just want my big sister back. I just want her alive. 


I am begging your friend to not drive drunk because as much as I dislike people in general, I would never, ever, wish this pain on anyone. It's a stupid, reckless choice that will cause so much hurt. 


Please don't drive drunk. Don't take a sister away from someone else, don't take someone's daughter from them. Pleas. "
"In my culture of the mid-Atlantic US, and probably others, a 27-year-old sweet on a 17-year-old is thought to be an emotionally immature creeper who wants someone naïve to use for sex, and to treat worse than women his own age would tolerate. 

You don't have to give your parents or anyone a detailed reason. ""I'm not interested,"" ""thanks, you're a nice guy but not my type"" is plenty "
"Does your organization have a policy about how many discount tickets you can pick up? It seems off that something like that isn't in place. If you're uncomfortable with it in general, I 'd just tell him that and if you don't feel good doing the number then tell him that. You're not obligated to do people favors just because they ask."
"Nice going dude. I torpedoed my mom's affair the same way, never felt too bad about it. That was some creative thinking, though."
"Roger continues to stick with this volatile, controlling, unhealthy relationship.  That's his choice, so he must accept the consequences.  "
"Honestly, this is above Reddit paygrade. You need to see a therapist.  Go to a free, low cost, or sliding scale one.  You are dealing with a lot here. But you are also focusing only on the negative and that is a really difficult cognitive habit to break by yourself.  You need professional help to refocus - but the good news is that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) offers effective strategies that don't take too long to work.  

You have built yourself a very fine mousetrap.  There are a lot of moving pieces and making a drastic decision is likely to hurt you or people you love more than is worth it.  You need help sorting out all the moving parts, being able to see how they work, and figuring out which to address first. Go get help to get yourself out of it.

"I found out when I was around your age the real reason my parents got divorced and it was the same reason. I had this big dramatic anger of like ""my dad isn't the real enemy; it's my mom!"" And I stopped hating my dad and started hating my mom. But my dad is not a saint and wasn't the easiest person to be married to. So I realized that they're both awful people, one isn't better than the other, and there's no point in putting energy into hating them. 

That being said, I understand how big of a shock this is to you. I don't think it necessarily changes the game because she's been the same player the whole time. But feel free to change your stance. Either keep living with her the same but with a new found disrespect, or leave and stay with your dad. 

Right now, for me, my parents' lives are their own lives and are discounted from mine and it's felt that way since I was 14. I just go about it.  

You still don't really know the full story. And you will probably never get it. If it's important to you, confront her and your dad (separately) about it. And if not, just keep going. 

Everything will be okay =)"
"I read this in another post earlier today but I think the sentiment is pretty spot on here, and you should say this to him: ""When I have to do everything around the house and take care of you I feel like your mom and guess what, your mom doesn't want to fuck you."""
"I don't think you're insane here.  He's not gonna give her up though, so I guess the next move is yours. What do you want to do?"
"I would ask them what happened to your personal stuff - your journals.... They don't take up space, what happened to them, why were they moved?   

Where did the clothes go to?  Were they thrown out?  Are they in a thrift store somewhere.

I would be tactful and say that while you appreciate the effort and good intentions, you are concerned about your journal and clothing which does not take up much space..."

"I think exactly as others have said, tell your brother everything. Your intention to inherit and then give him his fair share is honorable. You can support your brother's marriage (separate from the wedding!) in a host of ways which your father will be unaware of, and maintain a healthy relationship with your brother and his new husband. But spell this all out to him. "
"This is like, super cheating."
My boyfriend said he has terrible vision with his -1.something prescription. But then there's me with my -3.5 prescription trying not to trip and die on the way to the bathroom to put my contacts in every morning. Asking me to not wear corrective lenses would make me instantly give up the bridesmaid position. 
"You've proven again and again that you can't control your drinking. You continue to make promises to him, that you do not keep. And you drive under the influence. You do have a problem with alcohol. You can't not get drunk when you drink. Don't you think that's a problem? 

I mean, YOU DO have a history of driving drunk. You have proven you make bad decisions and can't hold your liquor. Add that to the fact that you have a young toddler, and I'd be worried, too. 
You married this man knowing how he felt about your drinking. 
Why haven't you gone to couples counseling? Try that. 

"
"To give context to what you're saying, for people who didn't read carefully, everything sounds like wholesome sitcom territory until it suddenly goes off the rails halfway through the second paragraph:

&gt; …My journals are gone. Clothes my mom didn't like (she hates spaghetti straps and concert t-shirts) are gone. I asked my mom where they were and she said ""we had to get rid of some stuff to make room!"".

&gt; They are mad I'm not excited and happy…
"
"In future, say no. You don't need the abuse and their kid needs professional help. "
"You go to the police right now. I think it goes without saying that this girl is toxic and not your friend, cease all contact with her. Why would you want to try to fix things with someone who is actively trying to ruin your life because you hurt her pride? She is not your best friend, she is your worst nightmare.

Get this stuff on record, now. As your previous employer for documents regarding your dismissal. Go to the police and write a statement about her harassing and slandering you. Go to a lawyer and have him send her a cease and desist. Pull out the guns, and do not let this crazy person bring you down without a fight. Good luck."
"First, you need to tell her parents what happened. Something is very, very wrong with this kid and she needs to get into therapy or medication. Second, I'd suggest you begin at some form of defenseclass. Karate, jitzu whatever - something! Flat out refuse any form of communication with this brat."
Man I hope she doesn't read that you think she is dumber and fatter uglier and lamer than you. 
"Seems to me you've done everything right and have a very clear handle on this, despite the emotional trauma you've been through at your parents' hands.
I salute you for attempting to have a relationship with them and for your little girl to have grandparents, but do either of you really need this toxicity in your lives?  You've tried your best, but they're never going to change.  Perhaps its best to just let them go, and I'm pretty sure your daughter will thank you for it once she's old enough to understand.
Keep up the great parenting.

"
"I moved in with somebody who pulled that same shit of wanting to soak up the last of his freedom--only he did it for a month before move-in date, not a whole damned year. I can't even imagine how frustrating that was for you to experience. What kills me is that he probably doesn't even understand how selfish and hurtful that excuse is. ""Sorry I didn't mean anything by it. I just wanted to enjoy every possible second I could away from you before I go to jail...I mean get married.""

Good riddance. "
"""Sir, I care deeply for your daughter, and I respect you and what you are trying to do for your son. And, while I wish him no ill-will, I cannot be a part of his recovery here. Your son went to great lengths to intentionally hurt me. And, while I can forgive him for doing that, I am not in a place mentally where I can offer him the help and support he needs in his life right now. Being with him will just make me angry, and likely make me say some hurtful things that might be damaging to his recovery."""
"There's been a lot of great suggestions here already, so I'm just going to pop in and say this: I truly believe that with young children in the house, and with an age of mother who knows what being an adult with a disposable income is like, your wife is thinking the same things that women all over think. The difference is that she managed to open up to you about it. And I think, as painful as it was to hear it, you should take that as some kind of silver lining. Parents aren't supposed to say they regret having children, especially moms. It's got so much shame and stigma attached to it - but she opened up to you, her husband, about it, and I think that actually speaks volumes about your relationship, in a positive way. 

Just remember that a person can have a feeling that they feel right now - but it doesn't mean they will feel that way forever. "
"Am I the only one that's gonna say it? Ok, Lily doesn't seem to clean to me either. She either has 0 social intelligence or doesn't care about you. A good friend will notice this, a good friend will notice you getting angry and talk to you or stop doing whatever he's doing."
"&gt;What should I make of this?

Ask him.

"
My guess is that part of her is worried that you'll leave her now that you can't have biological kids with her any more. I'd suggest solo counseling for her to process this difficult news and couples counseling to work through it together. Have you guys talked at all about alternatives like a surrogate or adoption?
I apologize in advance because I'm going to address something you did not address. I strongly encourage you to set up you own account and link it to your parents' account. Your purchases would still go to their place but it would give all of you a layer of privacy you don't currently posses. I think this is especially important as you indicated they sometimes blame you for things erroneously. 
"It's ridiculous for your fiancee to want this split. It's totally unfair and entitled. The idea that she can have fun money and also benefit from your money is not acceptable. 

I would not be able to marry someone who thinks this way. "
"Keep looking to move.

You are 100% correct that you have been pigeonholed. Your young age, unfortunately, is contributing to the problem as well as sexism. Rather than just applying blindly, find some women who are doing the job you want next or women who are in the position to hire for the job you want next, call them up and ask to take them for lunch. Smaller orgs especially may find your experience attractive even in a non-admin role. Ask them what your resume or application is missing, and how to get off the 'admin track'. Ask them if they'd keep you in the loop if they saw appropriate openings. 

It's going to be a long process, but your primary job now is finding your next job. Make sure to in your spare time. Pitch. Stop giving your job 100%. They can get by just fine with 80%. Give the rest to yourself."
So what you just described is definitely you enabling her anxiety.
"If he has her e-mail password, you should consider that they both message each other back and forth with that e-mail address to avoid creating evidence of their relationship through the use of SMS/Facebook Messenger/etc. That was what Petraeus did.

From everything you described here it certainly sounds like cheating to me."
"All these commenters are really hating on you for not knowing Spanish, but what I find your boyfriend to be doing is very rude. My family speak another language at home but my parents would speak English if a friend came over, because we are considerate people. My mom's accent is still super thick and she messes up words from time to time but she at least makes the attempt. The fact that your boyfriend won't speak Spanish with you (for whatever reason) also makes me think he doesn't want to make you a part of his life or take the effort to help you become a part of his life, either of which is shitty. Then on top of that you said he would never attempt to learn your language. This guy doesn't seem to care about you as much as you care about him. I've had boyfriends who loved trying to learn my first language, and I've had some who couldn't give a shit. The ones that didn't give a shit I found to be selfish people in general. You're young, don't put up with this if you don't have to. You want someone to respect your culture as much as they respect yours otherwise you will start to resent it in the long run. "
"You can either confront her on the issue or just don't use her as a pet sitter next time. If she asks why then tell her. 

Personally, I would just phase the friendship out because I don't have the energy to deal with other people's issues and you said she lies/gets defensive. 

Edit: even if you do baby your pets that is your right. I think my sister is insane with how she treats her dog... However, it's her dog and i follow all her rules when i petsit. "
" &gt; I felt sick, and again I know I shouldn't but I looked through his facebook messages to V. Nothing too unusual, though a lot of 'i love you's' and 'you're beautiful' which makes me uncomfortable but could be platonic. But he has also been video chatting with her for HOURS everyday, which only stopped about three or four months after we were dating. I'm talking 4-7 hours A DAY. I can barely get him to talk to me on the phone for 10 minutes with out him getting bored. I don't know if I'm over reacting but that makes me so uncomfortable.

It isn't platonic. He has screenshots of her in her underwear. He didn't stop when you started dating.

He cheated on you, OP, at least emotionally and quite possibly physically, too. How you deal with that is up to you but that's the fact of the matter."
"Take documentation and go file a restraining order. It doesn't cost you anything to do. And I would also look into a different job. They aren't protecting you. Sure, what he did wasn't on the clock but it's affecting work. "
"As a tenant, you are entitled to a certain amount of privacy within your residence.  This means you have the right to live your life - this entitles the noises, smells, sounds, and sights that come with living in an apartment.  Apartment smelling like onions from cooking? A-okay.  Apartment smelling like cigarettes? Not so much.  You're definitely not doing anything wrong.

Document every single contact you have with M.  Document every single time they come onto your property - putting notes on your door, touching any of your things, etc.   Alert the authorities every time they trespass onto your personal property.

If she's not going to respect you, you don't have to respect her.  Protect yourselves.  Live your best life."
Your friend is being ridiculous.  
"Your parents are going above and beyond in taking care of both of your families.  I think they have earned some guilt-free leeway here. 

&gt;I'd take my ass somewhere else to do my work if I needed silence.

I'm sure your parents are thinking that if you need someone to watch your kids so bad, you'll hire a sitter.  Your sister is pretty ballsy in commandeering the whole house, and you're kind of coming close to ballsy by expecting free babysitting twice a week.  The most loving grandparents in the world wouldn't be thrilled about caring for that many kids.
"
"You may have to kick her out and consider that money lost. It's an expensive lesson, but at least it won't break your bank or anything - you already don't have the money now. Kicking her out is tricky though if you really got the apartment as a couple.

If she refuses to move out, and you can't legally make her, you may have to move yourself and then just not take her with you."
"Tell him to buy one of those freezable lunch bags that have the cold packs built in.  You freeze it overnight and it keeps your lunch cold all morning.  He can lock it in his desk drawer so the guy can't get to it.  Sure, this should be solved by management but if they aren't doing anything, the easy answer is just to keep the lunch away from him.  That shit would last about 2 minutes where I work, and we have 3 refrigerators and 2 freezers."
Metronidazole is a decently common antibiotic that will make you so violently ill if you drink on it that youll possibly end up in the emergency room. If you need a scapegoat. 
"&gt;what you're probably thinking; ""why can't you just say no to him?"" 

No, actually I'm thinking ""Why the fuck are you with him at all?""


Owes money you since April, is an addict, lies about his paychecks,  you do all the  upkeep...  Add to that the emotional blackmail/failure to take responsability for his own actions (""Look what you made me do: I overdosed!""). Any one of those would be a break-up issue for a normal person. 

 I'm seeing a woman who needs to kick someone out, and then get herself therapy to work out why she puts up with this appalling treatment from an uttter worthless parasitic asshole loser.

"Yeah your waffling back and forth is not supporting your position at all. 

&gt; I've explained that I'm constantly back and forth between wanting a second cat and not wanting a second cat

Even though you've said you don't want to discuss it, saying this is waving a giant red sign in front of her that says TRY REAL HARD TO CONVINCE ME THO. You need to make a decision and be firm and make it plain that pet ownership in a couple has to be a united front - you can't compromise and get half a cat."
"So here's the thing. Nearly all FPS are exaggerated and super fake. It's more likely she used you as the model for her story, but doesn't really mean any of the things she said.

THAT BEING SAID, fuck that. It's still rude, cruel, and incredibly hurtful. Plus, who even wants to be friends with someone who spends time writing mean, angry stories about other people? It's petty. It's bullying. If I were you I would tell her I saw her dumb story, brush off whatever bullshit justifications she has, and end the friendship. You don't need people like that in your life. I know it's really difficult to end a friendship but you will be happier in the long run. 

Personally, I would leave the vacation immediately, but it's up to you whether you want to wait it out or not. Either way, I don't think this is reparable."

"They're mad at you? What did they expect? You're a teenager. Your room is like a sanctuary. And they demolished it without your permission. Your mom hijacked this as an opportunity to get rid of the parts of your wardrobe that she didn't like. Your journals are gone, even. Of all the people in the world, one would hope their parent and sibling wouldn't be the people to violate both their privacy and trust. This is a betrayal.

They chose to take on a huge project with no idea if you would like it or not. They didn't have your consent, you didn't ask them to do this - IMO they have absolutely no grounds to be upset with you. They should be apologizing profusely. I can understand that they wanted to surprise you and they thought you would love this - but they made a huge gamble and fucked up more than they could imagine. Frankly, I'm surprised the lack of consent or even interest here wasn't something they were mindful of.

I once visited my grandparents for a month in the summer, and I came home to some changes that my parents made to the kitchen. It took me months to get uses to it. I can't imagine the struggle and difficulty of the change being your room. Like a total makeover too, nothing to really hold on to from before. What a mind fuck. Your mother and sister have achieved beyond the opposite of what they intended. I'm sorry this has been done to you."
"Sports obsession aside, it's so strange that he thought it was okay to book up every night of your vacation without asking you about it, no matter whether the tickets are for sporting events or theater shows or whatever else...maybe approach it from that angle?

Go to the Police. What he is doing is hugely illegal. Tell the Police that there is no way your parents can find out. They WILL have dealt with this sort of thing before. Good luck. But do make plans for leaving home in a hurry just in case

"&gt; a hotel booking in the name of his female coworker for the town where we live

Girl

&gt; I asked him to stop and he said he had but turns out he lied because ""he didn't want to get nagged about it.""

*Girl*

&gt; he has her email passwords and that the password is a combination of my husband's name and her DOB

*GIIIIIIIRL*

Come **on**, you know this is all bull. She is close enough to him that HIS NAME IS HER PASSWORD! Who does that! I've never been more convinced that an affair is going on, and I'm so sorry.

If you really need the clarification, and I get it because I've been cheated on before and I had to *know for sure*, I would call up the hotel and pretend to be her. Make up a story that can confirm that your husband was in the room. Maybe say that you think he left a shirt there, and hope that one of the staff remembers seeing him and confirms it? 

Honestly though, you've got all the confirmation you need in my opinion."
"Sorry if this is harsh but you shouldn't adopt with someone who is "" enthusiastic at times"" about adoption. You shouldn't have pushed him into this. You should only adopt with someone else who is 100% on board with adopting.

"WHOA.  Yes, she's being manipulative.  Saying she's going to go back to drugs if you don't acquiesce to her demands is ridiculous.   But she's an addict.  Addicts can be very manipulative.  That's why it's a bad idea to get involved with them unless they are further in the recovery process.  She isn't.  She's not healthy enough to be in a relationship.    "
"Since he's a senior partner, I would choose the path of least friction. Act as though everything he says is harmless. Next time he makes a crack about how little your boyfriend makes, smile and say ""Then it's a good thing I'm not dating him for his money!"" or when he just says something rude about your boyfriend in general, ""Do you think so? I think he's just the best. He makes me really happy.""

Basically, combat his asshole attitude with positive responses about your boyfriend and act like you don't notice his saltiness at all."
"I agree with this one. That way you're explaining your thought process, not pushing him into anything, not leaving him out to fail and then coming back later with an ""I told you so,"" and you're actually providing a good opportunity to role model how to work through a problem. Maybe he'll get his ticket or maybe he won't, but it's possible he could see that, when you were worried about missing out, you chose the time to act. "
"Just make up a bunch of generic things about how intelligent and thoughtful she is and how she was there for you through the tough times, then tell 2 funny stories, 1 slightly embarrassing story that makes her sound cute or naïve (not like an asshole), then sit down, pat yourself on the back for being a good person, and get suuuuuper drunk."

The religion goes out of its way to create adults who are emotionally children. Read the posts about spouses here before you decide that you want to stick with her. You likely don't know just how wacky their beliefs and thoughts about this stuff are."
"No. Absolutely not. You do not need to give him a chance. Be with someone your age and stage in life.

If it's not too invasive, may I ask if that age difference is common in your culture. I'm from the US, and that age difference would be bizarre (and possibly statutory rape) where I grew up.

"OK if this problem is to be reduced, you are correct, the basement has to be cleared of clutter. Once that is done, putting dehumidifiers in the basement will really help. I grew up in an old brick farmhouse with a fieldstone foundation (basement walls made of huge, unshaped, not very well-mortared boulders) and we had so many house centipedes as well, and like your brother I knew they weren't harmful to me but they *completely* creeped me out. Getting the basement really dry, in our case, really seemed to reduce our centipede issues. 

Obviously, of course, the real problem is that your parents just don't give a shit. And the problem with hoarders is that they won't even let other people clean things or get rid of useless things because they have an abnormal attachment to their junk. Sigh. i don't know, offer to help your brother clean out the basement again and see what they say, but having quasi-hoarders in my own family, I'm not hopeful.  :("
"He's not genuinely sorry, otherwise he would have apologized profusely and immediately. "
"Please call the cops. My hardworking, young cousin was killed by a driver that was intoxicated. His life was taken by some jackass that just couldn't prevent himself from driving. And nobody stopped him. He served almost no time. My family has a lifetime of no cousin. If she has to go to jail to make a point, so be it. You might save a life."

"I would be careful about bringing up the fact that your sister told you, because it kind of makes it sound like your sister was ""tattling.""  Not that she was, but you don't want her mom to get mad at her.  Fortunately it's totally reasonable to talk about long-term financial planning when someone gets remarried.

I would say something like ""With your recent marriage, I'm sure you're reorganizing your finances and doing some long-term planning.  I wanted to say that I am still committed to paying for Sister'sName's college, so you and your husband can direct your saving efforts toward his daughter's education. I'm happy to be able to do this for my sister and I hope it's helpful for your family as a whole.""  

When it comes time to actually send her money, I would make sure you're paying tuition directly to the school rather than giving the money to the parents.  Fortunately, again, you have an easy out for doing this, since tuition paid directly to the school won't count against the annual tax free gift exemption.

And yeah, you must be a really good older brother because long-term planning for a surprise younger sibling's college education is pretty far out of the range of most 20 year olds.  

"
"The fact that they would both dump a child that they raised from birth is disgusting.  If my sister did something like that, I'd take the child in, never speak to her again, and sue her ass for child support.  "
"Yeah, but after you move out and mature the ""my parents didn't teach me so I don't know, honest!!!"" card can't be pulled - ESPECIALLY not if he's 36!!!"
You're not overreacting. It's not your brother's place to tell you how to parent your son.  Tell him you respect how he is choosing to raise his kids and you would appreciate it if he would do the same for you instead of criticizing you for doing things differently. 
"I'm so sorry that happened to you. How scary! 

I think it makes total sense that you feel this way, but be careful not to let your anger and negative emotions about the robbery and the burglars get transferred all onto him. He didn't break in and rob you guys -- he just didn't act like a hero when burglars broke in and robbed you guys. Now the burglars are long gone but he's still around, so now you might be projecting your negative feelings onto him. 

Yes, I'd be hurt and disappointed too, but only a little bit. Realistically what could he have done? He was terrified too, and he's not a trained burglar stopper. People, men and women, experience ""fight, flight or freeze."" He experienced flight and freeze, not fight. You also experienced freeze, not fight. (Which is good, btw, because fighting here probably would have gotten one or both of you hurt.) 

You really can't blame him. Truly, you can't. He was in the heat of a scary moment and saved his own skin instead of yours. You can and it makes sense that you would be disappointed and hurt by that, but only a little bit. Not to the point of blaming him or getting mad at him. And be sure that you aren't projecting your feelings from the burglary onto him. It wasn't his fault. "
"Creeps depend on women not wanting to sound rude. They intentionally create situations in which the only way to extract yourself is to be rude. It's either, do what they say, or be rude. So - be rude. He's being rude. He started it. Ignoring your polite rebuffs is rude. He's being rude to you. So be rude back. ""I don't want to be your friend - stop texting me."" Then ignore him. You owe him jack shit. It's not your job to coddle his feelings. You only have so much life. Don't waste your mental energy on him."
"&gt; Should I contact a lawyer as my sister's definitely influenced this decision? What to do now?

Honestly, if you fight for your mother's money, your sisters are probably going to look down on you even more. Not only were you unaware of your mother's depression and absent during her struggle against cancer, you are considering lawyering up to take her money. I'm glad your mother had her daughters to support her during her times of emotional turmoil. 

&gt;They told me that my dad took them out of his will, so she wanted to make it fair since I would get everything from him.

Assuming this is the truth, what was your dad's reason for taking them out of the will? Because your sisters took your mom's side in the divorce? You say the act of cutting you out of the will is out of character for your mom, what about your dad?

"That's silly. If they wanted this so bad it could have been planned for. 

When you have young kids, your life revolves around them for a few years. If you need a break from them, plan ahead! Not every young aunt is gonna automatically know how to take care of a 2 year old or a special needs kid. It's super weird for them to assume without a conversation."

"The easiest option is to tell him. You could even say ""darling I have to level with you. There is a surprise reason that we cant change the plans now - I've planned something special for the trip and you have to trust me"". That way you can hold on to the Hawaii thing if it mean that much to you? 

Or you could say you want to spend time with just him, at the original location, not a family trip for your anniversary. He may sulk about this and be difficult though, so perhaps you could combine it with the ""there is a surprise but you don't know what it is"" from above? Good luck :)

"About a year and a half ago, I broke up with a guy because he was verbally abusive, manipulative, and controlling. When I broke up with him, he continued the manipulation and deliberate attempts to hurt me in his anger. One of the ways he tried to hurt me was by showing me screenshots of a conversation he had with my best friend. 

The screenshots showed the two of them bashing me like I was worse than Hitler. I was a horrible, heinous person in their eyes simply because I drew a line and didn't let it be crossed. They said ""that's just the way she is,"" in their discussion of why I was so terrible. 

It hurt. A lot. These were two people who I cared for, albeit, one more than the other. My ex I was no longer in love with, but my best friend was a source of happiness and help for me in a time when I needed those things. But clearly she didn't feel the same way about me. 

I thanked him. I told him he did me a favor and made it all that easier to rid my life of the people who were not worthy to be in it. 

After that, I messaged her and told her exactly what I knew. I sent her the screenshots I had and I told her that I didn't have room in my life for people who don't respect me and that our friendship was at an end. Then, I wished her a nice life and removed her from mine. 

It was hard. It sucked. I cried and got angry. But in the end, I am a better, stronger, and more resilient person because of it. Use what your ""friend"" as an armor. Shield yourself with it and make it a part of you. 

What your ""friend"" did was not okay and you are well within your rights to ask her to leave your family vacation. I would sit down with your family or at least your parents and explain what happened. From there, I strongly recommend that you tell your friend that she is no longer welcome there and she needs to leave immediately. She's an adult and can find her own way home. 

"
"Sadly I don't think you're being realistic. You're gonna need to come to terms with the real possibility that he is going to move on and meet someone else.

I'm sure you can see that the relationship was not even, that you cared about him much more than he cares about you, meaning that it's unlikely he'll stay single and celibate.

I think you should try and move on before this happens or it will hurt much more.

Have you looked into therapy? It's very useful for getting you through difficult times."
"""It's a long story"". This is code for ""I am not going to discuss it with you"", and I have yet to meet the person who doesn't understand this."
"&gt;Basically, she said that she didn't really want to make the illusion that she was seeing anyone right now. So, she didn't feel comfortable introducing me to her friend and former classmate. This continued onto her saying that she doesn't really like running into people she knows when her and I are out in public together. This kind of hurt, to be honest..

Don't date people who are embarrassed to be seen in public with you - I don't care what their reasoning is.  You deserve better than to be someone's dirty little secret."
"Friends like these are one in a million. In real life and through this sub, I've seen how much people decide to detach from someone who's in an abusive relationship. Because that shit hurts to see. I've done it myself. 

God, what I would fucking do to have a group of people to care about me that much. I mean, I of course have my family, but I don't think I've ever had such support from friends and I really hope she doesn't throw it all away for an abusive asshole. "
"No, you don't have to stop saying you're bi because you married a man. That's silly. Do single straight women have to stop saying they're heterosexual if they're not fucking anyone? Do single gay women have to stop saying they're gay? Your friend is being a jerk."

When do you think she will see you as an adult and not tell what you are doing in your life and home? Want to paint? Cant do that. Want to change the carpet? She dosent like the carpet type or colour so heres this one she likes. Where does it end? How much longer will you be a child and not an adult?"
"...

This is one of the crazier things I've read on this subreddit. 

If I were you, I'd be completely insulted and disgusted by your girlfriend's suggestion that you somehow enjoy the attention of a 10 y/o girl.  Does she secretly harbor the fear that you are a pedophile? The idea that you will someday fall in love with her is even crazier...

Does she think that every girl that has a crush on you, even age appropriate ones, is going to steal you away? If so, she has crazy low self esteem. "
"I know you aren't in a good place now and I feel desperately sorry for you.

You started by asking whether you're being paranoid and Hell, no, you're not. 

I don't know whether this way of looking at things will help you, but it's a framing that helps me, so I'm going to share it on the off chance. Suppose you think ""What would Hercule Poirot do?"" (or Columbo or some other TV detective who goes about things quietly, and logically and by asking questions rather than by bashing doors in.)

The first question Poirot would ask was, ""Was the drink definitely spiked?"" The answer to that is, almost certainly: you were tripping out and your ""friend"" claimed to be hallucinating. The drink was almost certainly where the acid came from, because if it had been in a drink or other substance only you touched the ""friend"" wouldn't have had either real or fake symptoms from it.

However, if the acid came from somewhere else, then it looks worse for your ""friend"", because suddenly he's claiming to have symptoms when by all logic he shouldn't have.

""Aha!"" Poirot says next, ""Could your friend have possessed acid?""

Well, clearly both him and anyone else in the club could have had acid on them, but he (a) has used acid in the past, quite often if his trying to get you to try it has anything to do with it so clearly can readily get hold of it; (b) knew both that he was coming to see you and going clubbing, so getting sorted in advance would be easy for him. Therefore he's doubly the only person who could have planned to give *you* acid, because he's the only person who knew you'd be at the club and who was in a position to spike your drink.

I think Poirot might be interested next in the energy drink. Did he buy it himself? Was it poured from a can into a glass? Your ""friend""'s story is that the drink must have been spiked while he was drinking it and before he handed it to you. Therefore, if he didn't spike it, he was the intended victim of the spiking, not you, because no-one except your friend knew he would offer you some. Is there any specific reason why the group you were with might have wanted to target him? 

You don't seem very convinced he actually was hallucinating, and it certainly seems that he was very together for someone who had, allegedly, taken a powerful drug which he wasn't expecting to take.

Finally, who benefits? Well, the group you were with seem to have vanished into the light of morning, so no-one seems to have been hanging around to get the benefit of spiking his drink, so isn't it a bit pointless to waste acid on spiking a bloke's drink and then do nothing about it? But looking at your ""friend"" -- was that really the moment to start confessing his feelings and loading you up with emotional burdens you were in no position to handle at the time? Even if he hadn't spiked your drink, doesn't the fact that you were vulnerable and he'd been able to play white knight and get you home safely look like a bit of a lucky break for his (self-confessed) agenda?

Anyone who would deliberately and secretly slip a dangerous drug to someone who has repeatedly explained they have a specific sensitivity to drugs of that type doesn't care if they kill someone. That is not a friend. So, given it seems more likely than not that he is exactly that sort of person, what are you going to do?

I would be minded to tell this bloke that the reaction is now so severely that you're having expensive medical treatment and considering a lawsuit against the club for providing an unsafe environment and, if possible, tracing the people he thought did it, ask him if he'll provide a detailed statement of when he thought the drink was spiked, who was near him when he bought and poured it, etc and see what he does.

But I'd certainly never be alone with him again for the rest of my life."
"You can obviously set up the money so it goes directly to your sister once she is 18, or you can just directly pay her tuition. I worry if your sister has access to the funds that her mother will pressure her to transfer it to a joint account where some of it can be used for the step-sister as well. Also, if your sister continues to live with the parents throughout college, it may cause a lot of resentment issues. I know those aren't answers to the question you've asked, but I do think it's important stuff to think through. I would consult with a financial planner or whomever about the most secure way to handle this money to ensure it goes only to your sister. Once that's taken care of, I would reach out to her mother to say that you've set up the funds to be used solely for your sister's education. "
"Wow. Okay, this is way above reddit's paygrade.

Does he have a psychiatrist? Not a therapist or a psychologist but an actual MD head shrinker? If not, he needs one.

As to whether or not you should break up, well, only you can answer that, but OP, there is no real coming back from what he did to your dad. The only way would be for him to get legit help, and for it to work. Even then, maybe it's too little too late.

If *I* were you? I'd break up because he's not stable or healthy and needs to get a handle on his shit so he can't/doesn't inflict it on anyone else.

He hasn't physically hurt you yet, OP, but I think it's just a matter of time. "
"I think your mom has the weird, but still common, notion that any girl who isn't traditionally feminine or is ""a bit of a tomboy"" must be gay. ""Oh, well, she just *looks* like a lesbian!"" is how I usually hear it phrased. The movie *But I'm a Cheerleader* actually has a great running joke about this: one girl gets sent to a straight camp because she has short hair, doesn't wear makeup, and plays sports, but it quickly becomes clear that she's actually heterosexual. Nobody believes her, though, because of how she looks.

Have you ever directly asked her *why* she thinks you're gay? Because that might be a great starting point. Is it too much focus on gender norms? Is it anxiety--is she worried about you in case you are gay and wants to show she's there for you? Is she trying to be relateable? Heck, is it like what /u/Nyctanolis said and she's projecting? It'll be easier to figure this out once you know. Then you can tell her you'd like to sit down for a serious talk (obviously on a day when nothing else is happening). You can make it clear that you have nothing wrong with people being gay, but you are heterosexual, and you do not appreciate her continuously heckling you.

(ETA: forgot a couple of words)"

Let's get one thing out if the way first, though. A vacation with kids IS NOT a vacation. It sucks. It's terrible. I say this as someone who just got home from ""vacation"" with kids. I described bit to someone else as ""Taking care of my kids in a different place. A place that doesn't have all of their stuff that they need."" 

It sounds like you have a much bigger problem than Reddit can handle, but solely on the vacation front, would it be possible to send her away to a spa by herself for a long weekend or even a week? Could you use your vacation to stay home with the kids or get Grandma to come? I know that it wouldn't be ""fair"", but she is the one that sounds like she really needs it right now.

As for some of the other stuff, if she hates kid stuff why not do something else? Kids don't HAVE to watch cartoons and play with Play-Doh. Personally, with my kids we watch talent/dancing/singing shows and do crafts, gardening, and coloring instead. Maybe your wife could do more outside stuff with them? Walks, take book to the park, let the kids play on the deck while she uses her iPad?

Kids don't need to be entertained every moment. Once they figure out how to amuse themselves for 30, 45, 60 min at a time life gets a lot easier.

Good luck."

However, if you actually want to help put all relationship ideas out of your mind. It's selfish to think you've earned that right back just by apologising and it will do nothing but hinder her recovery. Help as a friend.

You being around is only going to aggravate the situation. So, let her go for now."
"Get out now. It is needed. There is no *if*.

If he is the emotionally abusive narcissist you believe he is—and I'm sure you're right—he's not going to you allow to get distance and heal. That's not the arrangement your abuser wants. He will escalate, and not allow it.

It's laudable that you want to improve yourself, but you can't learn to swim while someone is holding you under water. You can't learn to play hockey while someone is beating you with the stick. You can't get better at relationships and more emotionally healthy, when someone is abusing you and wants you unhealthy and feeling trapped in a terrible relationship.

This is not your fault. You don't have to be perfect to deserve not to be abused. It's okay to have faults and flaws. That doesn't mean you deserve to be abused. 

There may be no 'best outcome' for him—but if there is, you can rest assured that you are not part it. He'll need to go do that work on his own. You cannot save someone who is trying to drown you. He wants to drown you. You need to let go of the person who wants to harm you, and save yourself."

"Ugh I FEEL YOUR PAIN! My in-laws house functions this way. My MIL eats like a bird, I don't know how she keeps herself alive. 

Anyway, they're almost 3 hours away from us so whenever we go visit, it's usually for at least a weekend (more often 3-4 days). The first time this happened, I was very surprised. Surprised and irritable, haha. These people didn't eat breakfast (just a cup of coffee) and often only had a snack for lunch. Dinner is usually just a chicken breast &amp; some sort of side. Last time, she didn't get enough chicken, so we had to cut them all in half.. obviously no seconds. They aren't dessert eaters either. Cooking and eating is like an inconvenience in their day. Even at our own home, my husband forgets to eat. He once went a whole day (I wasn't home to remind him to eat that weekend) without remembering to eat until it was late in the evening, and he inexplicably felt like garbage. I don't understand people like this... I personally spend my lunch meal fantasizing about what kind of cheeses I'm going to include in my dinner.

I used to make up excuses to get out of the house and hit the local burrito place, and I'd stock up on protein bars to keep in my bag. By the 4th or 5th extended stay, I'd just learned to accept it. Now, I always pack bananas &amp; stuff for a peanut butter sandwich. It's not like I'm ""hiding food,"" I'm just making sure I have enough. 
When I first started doing this and felt the need to explain my additional ""meals,"" I'd just chalk it up to the amount of exercise I'd been doing lately (they know I'm a distance runner) and say that I needed the extra calories. Now, I don't even care to give any reasons, lol. And I have no shame in being like ""Peace out, I'm hitting Burrito Bandito! Text if you want anything.""

As you get to know them more, these things won't be such a big deal or an embarrassing issue. For now, learn to do what you have to do to get by. Lie about excessive exercise! Pretend to REALLY LOVE a local restaurant that you can only eat at when you visit them! Hopefully in time you'll grow more comfortable around them, enough to be totally honest that you're a girl who needs to eat ;)"

Nobody else has suggested this yet, but it's a possibility that your boss or someone else may be attempting to steal your identity to file for unemployment under your name. As your employer, she's likely have access to info such as a copy of your ID, SSN number, and tax info. 

It's concerning to me that she's trying to make sure that you're following the requirements to receive unemployment and with her personal financial issues (garnishment), your boss possibly has motive to do something like this. 

This might seem a little out there, but something similar happened to me where someone used my info to file for benefits under my name. 

At the very least, if I were you, I would contact your state's unemployment department and tell them that you believe someone may be attempting to file benefits under your name and that any applications made to them are fraudulent. I'd also keep an eye on your credit since your employer sounds kinda sketchy.

I think those friends minimizing your feelings are not your friends as much as they are his. Do you have your own group of friends who you can confide in? Or even better. How about you find a therapist to help you with your grief and to unravel and process all the complex emotions you are feeling. This might help you move on with your life. You survived a traumatic even and you are still pushing forward. Remember that. Once you have taken care of yourself mentally and emotionally you will be able to consider finding a new partner. But you come first. Get some professional help. 
"Look, OP, I get your frustration. Your boyfriend's psychological aversion to ""leftovers"" (an arbitrary category of foods which have been prepared some undefined period of time in the past) is completely irrational, and it would drive me up the wall to have to put up with someone with an apparent food phobia which is this extreme.

*However*, trying to trick someone into eating something that they don't want to eat by sneaking it into their food is not OK, no matter how irrational you think they are in avoiding that food.

I have a friend who avoids gluten. He has not been diagnosed with a gluten intolerance by any kind of medical professional. It's entirely possible that his intolerance is all in his head. But I am sure as fuck not going to perform secret medical experiments on him by sneaking wheat flour into the food that I make when he is visiting. So when I am cooking for a group that includes him, I don't use a certain range of ingredients -- I don't consider this an onerous limitation, since it only happens about once a week.

The leftover thing is not entirely analogous -- you can't have an allergy or intolerance to leftovers, because leftovers are not a chemically definable thing. Your boyfriend can, however, be absolutely convinced that food preservation is unsafe and eating food which has been in the fridge overnight is 75% likely to make him sick, and he can absolutely make himself sick just by believing this. The placebo effect is a powerful thing.

Your situation is also different because this is someone you live with and share meals with all the time. Your eating habits are clearly completely incompatible. So you have two choices here -- either start cooking separately for good, by mutual agreement, with each of you taking care of your own needs, or (if you're unwilling to live like this, or it's not financially feasible) break up with him.

You can't *make him* eat things that he finds repulsive because it's more convenient for you, and conversely he shouldn't try to make you eat in a more wasteful and expensive way because it's more convenient for him.

Apologise for trying to trick him; then figure out what you want to do next."
"Matt is not hiding lunches in honor of his dead dad. He does this because he's a jerk. That doesn't need compassion. Maybe Matt needs a week of hungry too. What an annoying brat.

He is not only a sex addict but also a pedophile.  Break up now and you need to notify the parents before it goes to more than just pictures of a child. If it hasn't already.

Ask him to support you and to make sure both of you (regardless of if he eats them or not) have snacks for next time. Its a team effort. Don't involve dad, i bet if he saw extra snacks he'd just complain. Keep them in your room/to yourselves. Baggies of nuts or seeds, dried fruit, meal bars, hell even a few chocolate bars or chips or something."

Make it clear through body language, eye contact and tone that you have no interest in communicating with her socially. I feel like this will help others who may wonder if you have a relationship doubt her account. 

You could also talk positively about your wife to others in a natural (and honest) way. Pretty much anything you can do to _demonstrate_ the exact opposite of what she's purporting in her email will make her lose credibility. "

"First of all, you really should not care what others think of your spending. It sounds like you are being responsible with your money. A couple of nice vacations is not really extravagant when you consider what you had to go through due to the accident.  

Second, you must ensure that you keep precise records of how you handle the money you are giving to your siblings.  You must record every single expenditure (use a spreadsheet) and make comments or notes as to why that expenditure was made.  You have to have all your records in order in order you explain to your siblings where the money came from and where it went, and you need to cover your a** in the event one of your siblings gets a lawyer and challenges your handling of the estate.  You need to be bullet proof if and when they come looking for an accounting of the money distribution.  It sounds like everything you have done so far with their money is above board and fair.

"&gt;I wouldn't go to rehab I don't need that.

DC social worker checking in here. As someone who has helped send dozens of people to rehab, **you absolutely do need rehab. ESPECIALLY with opiates.** That shit will kill you. And you need to be DAMN SURE that you do it right, because the #1 cause of overdose deaths for opiate users occurs when those who quit and then relapse by taking the same amount they were used to taking, not realizing their tolerance has gone to shit while they've been clean.

Bottom line: get professional help for rehabbing yourself. It doesn't have to be inpatient, but you need professional help. And be fucking careful once you're clean, if you relapse do NOT take anywhere near the same dose/amount of opiates as before or you could easily kill yourself.

Unfortunately, this is my experience as well. I ran into old high school people from a different MLM (Usana). After I wouldn't buy some chlorophyll pills to prevent cancer or something, they (having never gone to college) accused me (former cancer research associate) of being a Big Pharma shill trying to suppress small business owners for my own profits.

Most people don't feel a need to assure their families they're not sexually active, and I can only think of BAD reasons why she'd need to do that.

He joined the military when he was 18, so based on his age now that would have been about 2001.  Think about what major event happened in 2001.  Think about the fact that America then got into two overseas wars, during which time it was pretty common knowledge that they were struggling to find enough soldiers to send overseas (extending tours, doubling up, etc.).  It should not come as a surprise to you that someone who enlisted in 2001 or shortly thereafter served overseas.

Likewise, you've got a guy who is generally very open but never talks about his time as a police officer, gives the vaguest possible answers when you ask, or tries to get out of questions by acting like he's already told you about it.  From that, you should be able to figure out on your own that he was probably not a desk clerk or in animal control, and that there is probably some trauma there.

As for why he doesn't talk about even basic details, I would guess it's some combination of (a) he doesn't want to talk or think about it *at all*, because even a general discussion of it does bring up bad experiences or cause him to relive things, and (b) he thinks that providing basic information will just lead to more and more questions.  Which is a fair assumption on his part, since after getting a bit more information from that box DID cause you to immediately ask him and now the internet at large a bunch more questions.

What you should do:  stop asking.  If he brings it up, listen without asking for more details.  Maybe over time he'll talk about it more.  Maybe he never will.  Either way, respect the signals he's clearly giving off and let him decide when and how much (if anything) he wants to share."

Even if it seems silly, respect when someone asks you not to do something. If you can't respect her seemingly silly requests, what bigger requests would you brush off? 

I would wait to see what happens - she could try to speak with an academic adviser, explain the situation, and see if there's *any* way to salvage her diploma. Or at the least, if she might need another semester to retake that course or a similar one. I'm sure this situation has happened to some degree in the past, so they might be able to make a suggestion."

Your Niece thinks she's getting your old phone because your sister probably told her she could have it.  That doesn't mean you have to (or should) hand it over.

First, clear off your old phone before your Niece or Sister can try to take it from you so you have less chance of losing your pics and contacts and stuff.  Then, set a password on your old phone so it's of little use if Niece does get it.  Then, run a search online to see what the value of your old phone would be if you sold it to one of the online places.  You could either sell it to one of the online places, sell it to a friend or acquaintance, or offer to sell it to your sister.

"Having dealt with infertility myself, I can understand where she's coming from - and the other posters are right, this is textbook relationship insecurity.

When a woman finds out she can't have kids and both partners want them she can feel broken. She can feel like she can't give you something that you want - something incredibly important - something that other women can. Now she has to fear that she is not only losing the future family that she imagined, but her life partner that she loves too, and she can feel helpless because it's not something she can necessarily fix. She might realize you are her entire future now and that affects her affection levels, or she might be so afraid of losing you that she goes overboard with showing affection. I don't know if this is what your wife is feeling - but it is something that women faced with infertility can feel.

You absolutely 100% need to talk to her. Even if you wanted to have kids 5-10 years down the line, talk about your plan of action now.

Is this a 100% infertility issue or is it something that can be improved with medical intervention? It took me 10 years of treatment to conceive, but we did get there in the end. In the meantime, we had a plan for alternatives, including at what point we would look into adoption or whether we would simply decide to be child free. My husband made it very clear early on that even if ultimately we could not conceive OR adopt, he was not leaving me, and that he would be happy if in 50 years it ended up we never had any other family. Maybe you haven't thought about that in such distance yourself yet, but I do think it's something you should have a discussion about. This affects you and your life too so don't focus completely on her - make sure you spend the time evaluating your mental health and feelings.

If you do decide to adopt, it's a long process and knowing all the costs and hoops you have to jump through now can help give you both a feeling of security about the future. You'll know what you need to do and decide when to start looking at it.

She and you may also benefit from therapy either individually or together. A woman who wants kids being told she is infertile is a grieving process - she has lost her ability to create life and this will drastically change her self-identity. But you are suffering this loss too - It's a massively emotional situation for both of you. "
"Stop trying to play the blame game and put some damn restrictions on the iPad already. You're too focused on finding someone to punish instead of actually fixing the problem.

Kids are interested in sex. It's probably the youngest to be honest. The fact that you continued to accuse the oldest of something he didn't do and get angry with him is a surefire way to keep things from you in the future.

Stop finding someone to blame and fix it."
"I don't think you need to respond.  I have no context in my own life for your situation, so I may be off base, but IMO, you made the best choice you could in a situation where you were completely out of your depth.  The failings of the foster system are not your fault, and I doubt it would've been any better for that woman if she's been married off to a (probably much older) cult member as a young teen, probably forced to have many children, probably forced to see her children be abused and then married off themselves, etc.  She's still idealizing her past life, which I get, but the reality of it sounded awful.  You did the best that you could and it's not your fault how things turned out.

I want to suggest therapy to help you work through this stuff, if you aren't already seeing someone.  I can't imagine how tough it would be to have the weight of this situation on just yourself.  Good luck!"
Yeah I control the money. I'll pay her tuitions directly and give her only monthly stipends into an account that's only hers. 
"lol, you exchange working EVERY weekend for camping and the occasional meal? I'd say these owners have a fantastic business plan and the volunteers are getting mugged off.

Go volunteer for a charity. Not someone elses business."
"&gt;I knew they were unhappy for a long time

Divorcing is the right thing to do.

&gt;My poor mom, she's pretty distraught over how to get the house ready to sell. She doesn't even want to move, she loves that house. But she can't stay in it by herself &amp; carry the mortgage.

She needs to speak to a lawyer.  He doesn't get to dump the house / mortgage on her or demand she move out in 2 months.  She has rights in the divorce process and she needs legal advice on how to proceed."
"OH. MY. GOSH. Talk about burying the lede! Hey, if he's carted off by the IRS it'll save you the trouble of breaking up with him.

I'm sorry, but you have absolutely no future with this man. Want kids? You'll never be able to get approved for a house or invest for retirement together. Of course he wants you to avoid banks -- instead you're in the bank of BF, where he can steal from you whenever he wants!

I think everyone here agrees you need to cut and run (after depositing your savings so he doesn't get mad and ""punish"" you). You've worked really hard to get off welfare and get financially secure, which is admirable, and you're risking years of hard work by listening to his financial demands and giving him the power to wipe you out in a second.

Good luck. And if you do move on, please remember that in your next relationship you should feel comfortable making your own decisions about finances (and how you want to be treated romantically)."
"You paid for the flights? Cancel his ticket then. Doesn't matter if you lose money, let his new girlfriend pay for his flight back. I bet he'll find out real quick how devoted she is. And it'll buy you some time to get back home and sort shit out so you can leave him. What an asshole he is."
"**Meaning &amp; History**

*Derived from Semitic roots meaning ""serpent lady"". This was the name of the Phoenician goddess of love, fertility, the moon and the stars.*

 Well okay then. "
"Stop telling them things. Stop trying to make this work. They are (a) inflexible and (b) insane. Literally insane. You are never, ever going to get the relationship with them the way you want it, so stop trying. Live YOUR life. Let them worry as much as they like but dont change a thing

Just reduce contact. Change your number so only you can call her, not she call you. Every time they go unreasonable put them in time out of no contact  for a few days/weeks. And so on."
"Honestly he's been doing it for so long it's probably ingrained as his first response. Unless he's actually thinking about it, the first thing that pops into his head is likely going to be a lie to avoid confrontation.

At some level he doesn't grasp the idea that telling the truth, particularly for something harmless, will not cause confrontation, and the lying is actually making things worse than just telling the truth would be.

I suspect (but of course I have no training in this regard and recommend you seek a professional) that he had a troubled home life when he was younger and may have been constantly interrogated by a parent about all the minutae of his life. Kids quickly figure out it's easier to give the person the answer their questioner wants in order to avoid ""trouble"" when that authority hears something they don't like. It was a survival mechanism.

If this is the case, it's a long-ingrained behaviour, and since it's something he adopted to actually help him -- although he may not consciously realize it -- he doesn't see the behaviour as a problem that needs fixing. Or at least, not any sort of major problem that's actually endangering your relationship."
"Yeah... speaking as a former Mormon, there are other very important conversations you should be having with her too. If her religion is this important to her, it's very likely that being married in a Mormon Temple will also be very important. (Mormons believe that this is the only way for marriages and families to stay together in the next life).

In order to be married with her in a Mormon Temple someday, you would first need to convert to the religion, obey it's rules (including the no premarital sex one), and pay 10% of your income as tithing to the church. You would have to do this during a full year's delay before the marriage itself. And when you do get married, none of your family or non-mormon friends would be able to attend the ceremony.

And that is just the tip of the iceberg, friend. "
She definitely cheated and had sex with him. Her reluctance to admit this is a red flag. You can either try and work it out (preferably with Ralph out of the picture) or you can start filing for divorce. The former? Marriage counseling might help. The latter? Good divorce lawyer. Best of luck. This friendship and this marriage might not be worth it.
"She's not going to get the consequences of having an out-of-control child unless there are consequences to begin with. 

Doesn't it bother you that you don't want to hurt her feelings yet she's completely okay allowing her child to disrupt everything and make you and your children uncomfortable? You might not want to phase her out of the group, but there are times that your personal integrity and comfort and that of your children call for doing such things. If it happens enough and she is informed every time that it is because her son is disruptive and she refuses to do anything about it, there might be a chance that she starts parenting him instead of making you all do it for her."
"That's ultra weird. Like, why is this guy so fixated on your private relationship? Why does he even care? I personally think that public teaching is a very hard job and should be repected. Try to keep your own pride and opinions in mind and talk to your boyfriend about it. "
Yup. You're a pro OP. You did just the right thing.
"I'd also add that they've probably spent a lot of time, money, sweat &amp; tears looking after a terminally ill family member where you did little to nothing to help with the burden. Coming looking for money after this is not going to go down well. Accept that in your sisters minds (and a fair few people probably) you've been a shit. Stop looking for a handout &amp; work on your relationship with the pair of them. "
"&gt; If your friend tries the ""oh it's just some jokes, it's not a big deal,"" then the response is, ""then it shouldn't be a big deal for you to stop.""

This is genius. Really great line."
"&gt;This is something that I find really important and he won't share.

He's likely has some combination of PTSD and/or survivor's guilt. *This is 100% not about you*. Do not make this about you.

If you want to be supportive, tell him that you wish he would see a therapist so he can talk to SOMEONE about this, even if that person isn't you. Make it clear that while you want to know everything about him, you aren't selfish enough to assume that he has to tell you things that pain him.

He may never tell you about what happened or what he saw.  He may have done things that he regrets; he may see dead children when he closes his eyes. You will never be able to understand that, so don't try. "
"She'll absolutely notice. But if you hate the tattoos now, the other equitable option is to have the others removed. "
"If it's almost full and started in March of this year, that's probably just the most current notebook. I wonder how long he's been doing this, and if there are boxes full of notebooks from over the years stored somewhere. 

Doesn't matter if it's the first notebook and this is recent behaviour, or he's been doing it his whole life. It's weird and kind of creepy either way.

Otherwise, I have no advice. I'm puzzled as to what that may imply about him and what to do about it."
"Bro, you've only been dating 7 months. At least give it two years, shit. And yeah I mean, you must be really loaded if your parents think she's a gold digger. But as long as you get a lawyer to make a prenup your Financials should be safe and if she doesn't accept then I guess she was never th one. "
"That was my first thought when she said what was in the purse. 

OP I'm sorry but your dad DEFINITELY fucked a hooker in your bed. Give your mom all the details, burn the sheets, change the locks, and don't pick up your dad's calls or read his texts for awhile because holy fuck this is such a disgusting violation. "
"First this is classic ""trickle truthing"" where they slowly ease into the truth. Well we hung out and he tried to kiss me but I stopped him. Well we kissed but it was like 5 seconds and I stopped him. Well we almost had sex and I stopped him. Well we had oral but not PIV sex...
She knows she messed up and is affraid to tell you the full truth. So she's slowly feeding it to you and trying to convince you that what she did was okay so she can convince herself that it's okay before telling you more. 

You feel that your wife crossed the boundries of what is okay in regards to cheating and I would agree that I would consider this cheating in my relationship as well. I think she knows it also but just doesnt want to admit she cheated. It really doesn't matter though if she thinks she cheated right now though. What matters for your marriage is the fact that you feel cheated on. She broke your trust. How you are going to get to the bottom of that is difficult. Don't let her blame you saying are you going to throw are relationship and friendship away over this. No. That's on her, she crossed the line. She made that decision. You need to talk to your wife about what happened and what happens next. You need to figure out what you need her to fix this situation and if that situation is resolvable at all."
"I agree with this. If the grandparents wanted to make this work, they would. /u/Tw373217 is your sister the ""golden child"" in your family whom is always favored? If so, hurtful as it is this dynamic is playing out once again. 

Objective advice: 
Does your wife have family nearby that could assist with child care? If in-laws aren't any option your best bet is to seek an affordable baby sitter twice a week.

Now onto the petty option -- applicable if your wife's parents are nearby: 
I would start spending more time with them and praising them as grandparents. When you talk to your parents, work in mentions of recent visits your in-laws have had with your kids . Knowing the sun doesn't rise and set on them *may* motivate your parents step up their involvement..
"
"It just is what it is, I think you've analyzed the situation and come to a good understanding of how things are turning out this way.  

As someone who comes from a poor background and lives a good live w/ 6 figures in the city, this is sensitive territory.  Personally, I feel a bit awkward even inviting friends/family who don't have much to come hang out in my loft.  It just feels like I'm showing off (even though I'm not) or making them feel weird.

The only real adjustment I've been able to make is simply going to visit them, typically.  We go out and do stuff they can afford (head to the bar, get some cheap seats to a game, have a backyard bonfire, drink cheap beer).  That seems to keep the relationship on a more equal level.

I think even though you aren't shoving it in his face, just being able to see the luxury you live in and things you have are probably tough for him to handle mentally.

My only advice for you is to visit home more often and keep things at his level rather than showing him a good time at your personal mountain cabin etc."
"I was in a sorority in college and I agree with u/freethis to report it both to her school's Greek life director and her sorority's national chapter. I think there's a very real chance they will shut that shit down hard. 

'Top ranking' probably means she holds a position in the house and in fact is held to a higher standard of behavior than other sisters (aka, keep a higher GPA, *be respectful*, etc). It's a very real possibility her specific house is toxic or she's part of a nasty group within it. Maybe it needs to be set straight by nationals or even just her school's panhellenic counsel.
"
"To me this seems less like a misunderstanding about culture and more about communication. It sounds like your boyfriend is taking every criticism of America and his particular version of it's culture as a personal affront. And honestly, some of what he's claiming is ""culture"" seems to just be a defensive shield because there are plenty of people in America that recognize selling weed as selling drugs and stealing liquor as being a thief. The idea of ""culture"" seems like it's just something that's being used to shut out differing opinions as if ""Americans"" all agree with him.

So you should take two steps...

1. Sit down and think about how this is all making you feel and touching on the relationship.

2. Talk to your partner and figure out some ways where you can more honestly communicate and where he can learn to disassociate himself from the ""culture""."
"I'm also a bit shocked and slightly appalled that they don't consider it a vacation if they have to spend the entire time with their own children! I say this as a parent of a one year old, so I understand completely the need for some child-free time; it really is good for yourself and for your relationship. However, to consider something to be a vacation only when you spend time away from your children really doesn't sit well with me. 

Also, if parents do want some child-free time, it's entirely up to them to arrange it. 
"
"AWWWW

First kisses are weird. You'll get into it, don't worry lad."

"I don't think it's wise to address this until the mother comes to you to try to make this happen.  After all, right now it's just hearsay through your sister.  If you make an issue out of it based on that, your sister will be the focus of any fallout, as it will be obvious she overheard and told you.  Even if it's not, drama over your letter will definitely swirl around your sister.

Assuming the mother doesn't have any legal access to the funds anyways, I suggest you tell your sister that you're supporting only her but she needs to keep it to herself and not engage in any discussion about it with anyone."
"Well I don't know either of you, or the dynamic of your relationship, but I'm familiar with that type of trauma. Trying to imagine myself in her shoes, hearing something like this might be nice:

""Hey, I just wanted to say... I'm really proud of you. You are so strong, you've come such a long way, and I love you so much. I feel selfish for how I acted last week, and wanted to apologize. I hope you know how much I care about you. I'm always here if you need me."""
Thank you I like this a lot.
"Relationships are built on a foundation of trust.  If she knows you're sensitive about this information and KNOWS that you don't want anyone to know about it, that's a pretty serious betrayal of trust.

That said, I've had issues in my marriage before in which I've needed a close friend in order to confide in when things were tough, some things which can be easier to parse through with a friend that knows you and you can confide in without judgement or guilt.

Have you both been struggling with other relationship issues as of late?  I suspect there might be some other issues you and your girlfriend need to talk about, if I'm starting with the base assumption that your girlfriend isn't just a gossipy jerk."
"I could stretch my imagination to kind of understand most of it but the part that freaks me out the most is that you've never met her. He describes this person as someone he would die for, and incredibly important part of his life. If you where truly his partner he would share all of the important people in his life with you. If it's gone on this long an you haven't met her he's had to have actively tried to keep her away from you. The only reason he would do that is if his feelings for her conflict with his feelings for you and in that case, it's at the very least an emotional affair. Probably worse though. "
"Mail carrier here,

You can also call you're local PO and report her for opening your mailbox. Unless you are the box holder, are acting on behalf of the box holder or a USPS employee, it is against the law to access someone else's mailbox.

That's assuming you're in the US of course."

"If someone doesn't like what you're offering them, then take it back and let them do it themselves. Tell her, ""Mom, it's a free vacation. This is what I'm offering you; take it or leave it. Let me know what you'd like to do by the end of the week. If I don't hear from you by the end of the week, I'll consider that to be a rejection of my offer of a free vacation.""

Also, nip this line of thinking in the bud right now:

&gt; The prize isn't really my money I guess so should I be more generous with them?

It IS your money. You earned this bonus (not prize--BONUS) by being a kickass employee two years in a row. It's 100% your money. And even if it was just a prize that you were lucky enough to stumble upon, it would *still* be your money, because *you* won it. "
"OP's sister is blowing out candles in a house fire. 

And unfortunately this happens a lot in life. Her own demons and (possibly?) creeper husband are things she cannot yet face for some reason. 

OP's phrasing could be supportive while also drawing her own clear lines. 

She could tell her that she understands how their shitty Childhood  was damaging, how therapy was helpful and how she deserves a trustful husband while stating that she will wear what she wants and there will be no more discussion on that end. But she's more than happy to support her through starting therapy."
"Ohhhhhhh my god.... I'm so sorry what the fuck, this is awful :("
"&gt; Her idea of a break and mine is that while you're only on a break, if you do stuff with other people you cheat.  

It's a 7-month relationship. Dump her and move on. I promise you there are tons of decent people out there. She's not one of them.  

But according to your post, *you're in a rush to forgive her and continue the relationship*. Best thing you can do is accept the fact that your girlfriend was *so attracted* to your friend that she was willing to completely betray and disrespect you just to get with him. That attraction doesn't just disappear. She's very much into him. "
"When I was in college, I was randomly matched to a roommate. 

We became ""friends"" very quickly, and although there were multiple breakups, the ""friendship"" lasted for a total of 12 years. 

She called me her best friend. Possessively. She insisted we get portraits made together a few times. We spent all the major holidays with each others' families. 

One of the ""breakups"" - I wish I could say the last one but I did allow her to weasel her way back into my life one more time after this - was particularly difficult. 

I had gotten involved with her brother. It wasn't on purpose. We had met briefly years prior, and then he came to town while she was working and I was on summer break. I entertained him, and we bonded. We were about 2 weeks into conversations about ""what the fuck are we gonna do?"" and ""how are we going to tell her?"" when she found out. 

She was over at my house and I was making dinner for us. He texted me while I was elbow deep in raw meat, so she picked up my phone to read it to me and type my reply for me - a totally normal occurrence - when she discovered that it was her brother texting and that the message was intimate and affectionate. 

She lost her fucking mind and hurled unimaginable abuse at me for weeks until I finally just said ""fuck it, I don't want anything to do with you OR him!"" and severed ties. She pursued me aggressively for many months, and I stonewalled her. She ended up moving out of state. 

Once she got settled in in her new place, she posted a note on Facebook about how nice it was to be somewhere new and not held back by having a fat best friend. There was a whole bunch of stuff about how she could go skating on a whim, guys would approach her now, she could dress cute and not have someone sloppy sitting next to her, etc. She detailed a few specific incidents where having me - a fat person - around had been a detriment. 

Several mutual friends recognized it all as being about me and screen capped it and sent it to me. (They thought they were doing me a favor. They weren't.)  I didn't say or do anything about the horrible Facebook note and a year passed. 

I had a death in the family and she exploited it to regain entry to my life. I made the mistake of letting her back in, and it only got worse from there. 

Do yourself a favor and sever ties with this person who is unequivocally not your friend. "
"They weren't on speaking terms when we got married. 

And I'm typing that thinking ""of COURSE they weren't. She was probably upset he was getting married"""
Thanks. I think I'm going to find a job and then seek emancipation. I'd be working at my parents' restaurant but they don't like a hijabi waiting tables :\ ironic. I'll update you or post an update thread whenever something significant happens
"He is a fucking idiot. And not a nice man. When you wrote ""I know that tone."" my heart sank and I felt nauseous: I know that *type*. Controlling, unreasonable, inflexible, and it's all your fault for not doing everything in your whole life exactly the way he likes it.

You are well off without him."
How hard is it to say he has to go because of a family emergency? Seriously. I can't imagine almost any place firing you for needing to leave.
"Maybe she's used to doing the work of adulting while he acts like a kid.

1) Girlfriend is loading up the car with cat, dog and bags. He's ""bored"" because she's taking a while, so instead of helping her, he goes to play outside with an indoor cat. 

2) When asked why the cat was out of the crate, he laughed instead of listening to her legitimate concerns.

3) When cat ran off and girlfriend said to not chase, dude chases. When girlfriend asks him to put litter box outside, he questions her. 

4) As girlfriend is upset and crying about something he caused, he's trying to make it about him and wants her to comfort him. Instead of doing things to make the situation right, like looking harder, knocking on neighbors doors, splitting up so they cover more ground, etc. it's more about his feelings, and he won't leave her alone after she repeatedly tells him to lay off.

This guy is 32 and needs to grow up. "
"Agree.  They should have just asked for help.

If they want to adopt the 'we're a village' mentality to child rearing, then they need to make sure the rest of their assumed village is agreeing to the idea.  In other words, ask for help, don't assume people will offer.

And the flip side: don't assume people should be offering.  "
"Yup. He's assigning meaning to your innocent behavior, and rather than check in with you (good communication) and take you at face value when you say that your behavior wasn't promoted by any kind of problem between you (good communication), he *chose the meaning of your behavior for you* (bad communication, also kind of abusive). 

Don't let him do this. Better to stay broken up."
Plus it feels so... High school edgy. 
She punched you in the face and fucked another guy. There is no making this work you need to divorce her. I hope you took pictures of the evidence. 
"You two have no long term future. If you don't want to be with someone who's already planning his break up with you, then move on. "
"There's a free app called NextDoor - it's like a neighborhood chat/craigslist/neighborhood watch thing.  See if your neighborhood has an active or semi active community.  If so, try posting pics of Ghost with a little general note:  Hey, I've had some very well meaning people ask about Ghost.  His breed is uncommon, so he's not what you are used to seeing.  He is actually at a very good weight for his size, as confirmed by his vet and animal control.  He needs special food because of his breed and allergies, but he has a great vet and doting 'parents'.  If you see us out and about, say hi!

It might reach your neighborhood crank, but what it will mostly do is educate her neighbors and make you that friendly person with the gorgeous Ghost doggie.  A little peer pressure is gonna help where direct confrontation may not."
"She's 29.  Getting divorced now will not ruin her life.

Devastate her, sure.  It's rare that breaking up a marriage isn't hurtful.  But it's not going to ruin her life.

But, if I may - and I speak this as a childfree woman - get over the ""I'M RATIONAL and LOGICAL and she's just giving in to STUPID EMOTIONS.  If she could just GET OVER these EMOTIONS life would be PERFECT"" attitude.  It's shitty and entitled and contributing to the problem.

&gt;You see, my approach here is based on reason and pragmatism. My wife on the other hand is 100% emotions driven. 

I kinda wanted to punch you at this point.  

If this is the attitude you're presenting to her - which I'm sure you are because you're not smart or clever enough not to - then it's no wonder you two can't have a productive discussion about this.

And really, you're missing option 4:  You divorce, she finds another man to love in a lovely country and goes on to have children in her mid-thirties.     You're not in some backwater part of Ethiopia, you're in *Australia*, a fucking first-world nation.  She's young and has a good career - what narcissism makes you think she wouldn't be able to land a second guy to date?

You have to divorce.  You've hit the ultimate dealbreaker, the uncompromisable issue.  And yeah - you've done her a disservice by not sitting down and figuring this shit out earlier in your life.  But it's done.  You're here, at this point, and you can't go backwards.  What's important now is to stop with the over dramatization of this and make the decision to stop wasting time."
"I don't think you're on a reporter career path there. I think you are an admin assistant and as long as you stay there you will always be an admin assistant.

"Coming from a VERY insecure female who has insane, made-up jealous issues that I have tried to work on for years with little signs of improvement:

This chick is crazy. 

You need to have a serious conversation with her about this. It's not okay to think that. It's not okay for her to suggest that. Does she have a history of sexual abuse? I could see something twisted like this being a result of past trauma, but otherwise... I'd just not stand for it."
"As others have said, you just can't adopt a baby and tell him to live with it at this point; it isn't fair to anyone. But frankly, I'd be evaluating whether I wanted to stay in this relationship. Are you completely unable to have children? If so, are you okay with never having a child? If you can, are you okay with the risk that it may be or later become disabled, knowing that your husband doesn't want a disabled child? Are you okay with being married to someone who thinks children are unworthy if they didn't come straight from his genetics? Would you still want to adopt a child if you left him? 

It's up to you, but these are some questions you should be brutally honest in asking yourself before you give up on this entirely."

"If its as platonic as he wants you to believe, he wouldnt have a problem with you meeting her."
"&gt;On one hand, I do want him to feel like its ""our"" apartment, and not just him staying in mine. On the other hand, if I'm paying for everything, I think its fair I have most of the buying &amp; design decisions. 

Pick one.  Either it's shared, in which case his opinions are just as valid as your opinions, or it's yours, in which case you shouldn't expect him to treat this place like his home.

&gt;I want to make it pretty nice and I have a lot of ideas about the design/aesthetic I want.

If you want exclusive control over the appearance of your apartment, live alone."
"&gt; I feel really hurt that he didn't attempt to help me 

How? Anything he could have possibly done would have resulted in an immediate escalation of force and violence. He's not 2 people and he wasn't armed.

&gt;at least try to find my cell-phone 

Was your cell phone locked in his room? Do you think he could have found your cell phone in the split second he had to react? 


This is an extremely traumatizing and shitty situation and I am so sorry it happened to you. But at the end of the day, you need to realize that if ANYBODY had done ANYTHING differently, you both might not be here right now."
"Welp, *now* , he has plenty of bachelor time.

The pornography addiction may also explain why he didn't want to go on the trips with your parents too. Hard to hide that addiction in a cabin full of family for days.

Also, he probably did make the biggest mistake of his life. Sucks for him but you have a bright future. 

You sound really mature and level headed. I hope you find a new man who appreciates you 100%!"
"Dude how are you even asking this? I'm baffled!

Even if you only had plans to take your GF to a movie, and Jess asked for a ride somewhere that conflicts, the answer to Jess is no. But a wedding is an even bigger deal.

Relationship 101:

1) Don't take girls other than your GF on dates. (Taking a girl to a wedding as your +1 is a really datey date.)

2) Honor commitments you've made. (If you plan a date with your GF, keep it!)

3) If a female ""friend"" knows you have plans with your GF and asks you to do something with/for her at the same time, she's pushing boundaries. (GF should win.)

"My father has cancer, most likely terminal at this point.

Your boyfriend is an asshole, he said it knowing it would hurt you, wanting to hurt you. Wanting to hurt you is not a good trait in a SO. You deserve better, especially while dealing with your dad."
"This is textbook manipulation. Using her sobriety to guilt you into taking a damn week end getaway? Knowing that you can't afford it? Yea that's immature and hurtful. Does he often go this low or fight dirty when she doesn't get her way? 

If you were friend I'd tell you not to accept this behavior. Respond with something like ""I know you're disappointed about the destination of this trip but using your sobriety as a bargaining chip is not okay with me. I care about you and your health and take your sobriety seriously, You using that against me is unfair. I want to travel the world too but I have to do it in a responsible way. I simply cannot afford the trip you want to take right now. If you have opportunities to travel abroad without me, I encourage you to take them! I'm not trying to hold you back, I'm just doing my best to be honest about my finances and do the responsible thing.""

And if she continues being unreasonable or manipulative or you notice similar situations in the future I'd suggest you leave. This isn't healthy behavior.

"First off: congrats on finding a great guy; you seem to complement each other well :)

This world has recently become much more accepting towards gay and lesbian people. Friends' families I thought were too homophobic for my friends to consider coming out, have instead rallied in support around their kids. Depending on where you live, your son likely has a very accepting worldview that would be totally fine with your relationship with Adam.

I'd argue that you *must* tell your son, and sooner rather than later. From a social development perspective, he should be normalized to the idea that two men can be in love. Additionally, keeping huge secrets from your kid can only lead to a rift. Don't you want Adam to know your son not as a roommate of his dad, but as his daddy's boyfriend? Or maybe, someday, stepdad? I know it can be very difficult to face potentially intolerant family and friends, but I think living a lie is worse, don't you?"
"I disagree with some of the people posting. You told him for 5 months how important this was to you, and he couldn't even spare an hour out of his day to do something you wanted to do. 

When you're in a relationship, there a compromises. Do I like going to car shows and look at car parts and tires for hours? Hell no. But I do it because I care about my s/o. And he would go with me to the mall or to a museum any day, even if he hated it. Because it shows HE CARES. 

you have every right to be mad OP. "
"It's not selfish. They didn't sign up for taking care of your special needs siblings for the rest of their life after your parents pass, and it seems very obvious that you're already taking care of them partially as it is. That is a really big deal and really stressful. It's not selfish of someone to say that they don't want a future like that, and it's not selfish to want to ensure that they don't purposely bring in special needs children into this world. We all have choices. Your boyfriend and his mother clearly accepted that's not the future they want for your bf, and you've clearly accepted that you will probably take on a caretaker role for your siblings in the future. You just have to accept that not everyone is willing to take on that role and it doesn't make them selfish if they don't want to. Just like it wouldn't be selfish of you to opt to not take in and take care of your siblings whenever your parents pass. Best of luck to you, I truly think your candidness will help you find someone that will love you and stick with you."
"&gt;I just find it mind blowing that this has not occurred to her

Yeah, that's culture shock. I understand that you're frustrated, but you need to accept that she's not doing anything wrong. Feel free to talk to her about it so you guys can get on the same page, but don't come at her with this attitude. She's not an inconsiderate idiot, this is just how dating works in her country. There's no ""cultural differences or not"" here. It's all about the cultural differences."

"Do not fall into the trap of relying on this doctor for your only advice. I was with a bad therapist for 2 years and I actually had to UNDO some of the things they said, while I was paying for their professional consult. If you're uneasy about what you're saying then it's time to move on. I understand it can be hard because finding someone who is really willing to work with people with autism can be a long process and it may be hard to wade through the crap of insurance and other doctors, but DO IT. She should not be blaming you at all. Blame is not a healthy coping mechanism."
"Oh God. Hell, no. If I am not mistaken, I would say she is a very calculated person. It is as if she has planned all this. You are in a remission. Stress is bad for immune system. What if you relapse because of stress?

"This system you have manages to sound both rigid and chaotic. You have to eat lunch together. You have to alternate cooking lunch. You have to call this meal at 6 pm lunch, instead of just saying if he wants to be out at lunchtime, you can fix your own meal (of course you're hungry at lunchtime! That sandwich isn't a snack to tide you over until lunch, it IS your lunch) and when you dine together at 6 pm, that will be dinner because a meal at 6 pm is dinner. 

It sounds like he demands you live by this system (since you say he'd get upset if you changed) and then he wrenches and contorts the system as he feels like and you just have to contort yourself to keep up. No matter what YOU feel like doing, like eating at lunchtime. It sounds awful. "

"Honestly, stop being quite so 'supportive' and tell him you're his girlfriend, not his therapist. When he comes back, tell him this has gone beyond an acceptable level of insecurity to a point where what he is doing to you both is unkind, and he is beginning to disrespect you. He needs to speak to a sex-positive therapist about it. 

To be honest, I even wonder a bit if he's acting out a sexual interest or kink with you. If that's the case, he needs to be aware of it and honest about it, not use it like a baseball bat he occasionally beats one or both of you with."
"Depression doesn't always look the way you think it does. I have depression and will go for weeks feeling good (just nice and level, not manic or high) about life and then BAM I'm down for about a week or two and nothing I do matters and I have to fight like hell to get back to level.

She might be like that. "
"Ohhh man, I did not catch that line about jealousy.

"For a parent to tell their adult child that the child is being ungrateful by not sharing a bonus from work is selfish and terrible parenting.  The way my mom has always looked at it and explained to me:  Kids have never asked to be brought into this world.  You didn't ask for everything your parents gave you - they decided to have you, so they decided to commit to that.

I think you're a very generous soul to do this for your parents, but I think it's time you gently remind them the morals they raised you with.    You're not being the ungrateful one, they are.  Who looks at a gift they've received and says ""This isn't nice enough, find something better?""

I suggest telling them that the hotel you picked is what you're offering, and if they don't like that then rescind the offer.  ""I'm sorry this doesn't work for you.  This is what I can do, so if you don't want this trip, I'm going to take it."""

"Disclaimer: no one on Reddit will have the context of what your relationships with both women are like, or what your girlfriend and mother's relationship is like. I think that context will matter, so you might not be getting advice appropriate for the situation.

Given that, I can see both sides. While it's a gift and you have to assume it's well-intentioned, I can see the imposition of having to store an entire dish set in addition to the one you already own. I can also see becoming miffed at the critique and assumption your mother made (who are you throwing dinner parties for that require more than six plates?). 

Look honestly at the intentions of both women in your life. If you don't know, ask them. Always keep in mind that your [future] wife should take a priority over your mother in most cases.    "
Seriously!  The kid didn't ask to be born.  None of this was his choice at all.  
The guy is 36 years old and doesn't even know how to grocery shop? What'd happen if you guys had kids and you were too tired to cook? Or needed him to run errands? How does this guy survive in nature? I (at 31) STILL make fun of my friends who couldn't cook/do laundry at 18 when we went to university. Dude is THIRTY SIX?! At 36 he's made his life choice I'd say.

"Everyone commenting so far seems to have missed the part where the BF says he thought he was free of this game after moving out of his parents house. Sounds like he had serious trust and boundary issues with his own parents that he might need to work through. This might explain the extent of his issues. Rather than recognise this OP just behaved in the same way, manipulating him and refusing to recognise his autonomy. Completely understand why he is now cooking all his own food. "
"&gt;I am heartbroken and my question is am I overreacting and is this salvageable?

I am so sorry this is happening to you, but if anything you are **under**reacting and no, this is not salvagable.

For starters, he cheated on you. Emotional cheating and sexting *are* cheating, make no mistake about that. How can you marry someone who cheated?

He cheated *with a vulnerable 19 year old.* That is predatory. He's 16 years older than her.

He cheated *with his subordinate at work.* That is **also predatory** and incredibly unethical, not to mention a massive abuse of power.

He did not come clean or admit this on his own. He **never** would have told you had you not found out first.

He *humiliated you* because as you said, everyone else knew. He wasn't even bothering to be discreet (not that it would matter if he was, but still). This just showcases the lack of respect he has for you.

This sucks, but you have to leave this scummy guy."
It's not a thing (yet). It's meant to scare you about the potential death of net neutrality.
"Just be prepared for that conversation to either go poorly, or for him to try to convince you that you're wrong. Everyone thinks they are doing the right thing. He's not going to react well about being called out on his shit. He's going to try to defend his point of view. In the end, his point of view isn't the one that matters the most, yours is."
"&gt;He's great at getting at the heart of something and helping me get past it - he has no formal training in therapy but is incredibly comforting.

Look, you cannot put Rob in the position of being your primary mental health support person. It's not fair to him, it's murder on relationships, and it keeps you from diversifying your support systems, which is 100% necessary for everyone. 

Even if you don't feel the need right now, find some other support. I'm guessing that means a therapist but a support *group* could be just as helpful, I'm guessing. "

&gt; I cannot stand living under the same roof with someone who burned me so bad while I am in such a vulnerable position (pregnant!), but at the same time If I kick him out he has no where else to go.

He should have thought of that before cheating on you.
I mean come on, you don't bite the hand that feeds you. That's rule #1 in the book.


&gt; Is there the possibility of him trying to get full custody to spite me for leaving?

That's going to be pretty difficult for him to pull off legally if he is demonstrably unable to afford to live on his own, let alone pay for the upkeep and needs of children.



&gt; When I told him that I wanted him to find another place and he took the keyboard and mouse that bought for me and said ""this is mine, if you want nothing to do with me you cant use it.""

Let him take his keyboard and mouse to the homeless shelter. They might have a PC lying around he can plug them into?



I've never been in your situation with the kids and all, but I have been cheated on. And I've given people second chances, which never, ever worked out for the best.
Know that your feelings are valid, and if he is going over to this woman's house to cheat on you then he is doing something wrong not you.

Regardless of whether or not you are having kids, if you feel that you can no longer love him, forgive him, or accept him as your partner then it is OK for you to separate and expect him to get out of your parents' house.


If he didn't have enough money prepared in case he got caught, then he shouldn't have jeopardized that. Hand that feeds. Don't bite it.


I have to ask though, what's the difference between an ""emotional affair"" and a regular affair?"

"My ex husband did this. 

It started with just running out a few days before I should have. Odd, but I figured I had just gotten confused and counted wrong. 

Then I was calling for refills a week or so ahead of schedule. 

My ex accused my friends of stealing them. Even claimed he saw one of them do it. 

Then he started asking if he could have one or two every once in a while, but I was running out in two weeks. This is 60 damn pills we're talking about. 

Then he got pretty open about it. He was taking ten a DAY. Since he was abusive on top of this, I was afraid to hide them or refuse to give them to him. The massive amounts of adderall made him even more abusive and he got extremely violent. 

When I left him, he went into an absolute panic because that meant his adderall supply was gone. 

And now he's on meth. 

So that's a SUPER extreme story and probably not typical. But just be aware that it can escalate into a huge problem for some people. "

"Ha, no, no counseling! Your husband was comfy and he had no reason to take action. You're the golden goose. He could sit back, bang the wife whenever you were working and profit from you keeping James busy; all the while keeping you on your toes for being inappropriate. All he had to do was not be caught. Counseling would've just given him more chances to lie to you and tell you why it's your fault that he's been cheating for at least a year. No use for that.

Sometimes there is no good answer why someone throws everything away. There's nothing that would be a comfort. Some people just aren't really nice people on the inside. Perhaps get some counseling to work through emotions regarding this.

Good job, OP on protecting yourself and having foresight despite the love blinders. Hopefully James has similar protections. "

I wouldn't worry too much about being outgoing and assertive, like with any date it's better to just be yourself and see if it clicks. If he's looking for someone outgoing and assertive, and that's not who you are, then it's just not meant to be, y'know? So be yourself, make conversation when the opportunity arises, and when he's talking to another girl, just chat with the other girls that are there.

The way he gives you ultimatums and controls you is not ok.  The way he screams at you is not ok.  Your body is telling you that this relationship is destructive to your physical and mental health.  Some therapy might help you break away and figure out a more healthy way of choosing partners.  Please don't delay.  "
"Wow, I really could have written this post. I have, literally, the exact same problem with my SO with the only difference being that he also gets angry when he's stressed; so I was not only being pushed away/given silent treatment, but when he did talk to me, it was negative and angry and usually starting a fight.


I communicated until I was blue in the face; told him how much it hurt me when he did that, told him that's not how you treat someone you love, asked him to go to therapy, everything. Didn't matter. He would either ignore me, literally not responding to what I said, or turn it around like I was the bad guy.


Finally, after one blow-out, I told him that if there had been a child in the house to witness his behavior, I would have left him and never come back. 


In the end, here's what I suggest for you:


Sit him down sometime calm. Tell him that you have something really important to say, and that he doesn't have to respond, but he needs to listen and really hear you. Do not soften this with your tone of voice; use your body language and voice to impress on him that this is a Big Fucking Deal and Serious Talk.


Say exactly what you said here: ""Husband, I just feel like every time you do this behavior, which I don't think is meant to hurt me, you push me away a little more and how I see you changes. It's like I lose a certain amount of emotional intimacy with you each time and I see you a little less as a husband because I feel like that's not how husbands are towards their wives. 


I can't trust you to support me during times of stress. I can't trust you not to hurt me when you feel stressed. 


This is me, telling you, that every single time this happens, without exception, I lose trust in you. I lose a sense of intimacy with you. I do not feel I can be vulnerable with you. Without exception, every time, you hurt our relationship a little more.


I'm asking you now to do whatever you need to do to change this. I am asking you to see a therapist, or do whatever work needs to be done.


If you chose not to make changes, and if you chose not to hear what I'm saying now, you need to understand that at some point you will damage our relationship so badly that I will never be able to recover. This can, and will, end our marriage if you choose not to work on fixing it.


I love you and I will support whatever method you prefer for dealing with this. My preference is therapy of some kind, either individual or couple's, but if you want to go another route then I will support that too.


I need you to acknowledge that you've heard me. Do you understand that I am saying you're hurting me, and damaging our relationship doing this?""


You need to really, really push here until he says ""yes"". He doesn't need to say anything else, but he needs to verbally acknowledge to you he has heard what you've said. He doesn't need to agree with you - he just needs to have heard you. As in, you need to literally not move on in any way until he acknowledges that. If that means you two spend the rest of the day not talking, then that's what it means. 


After that, use the same wording: ""Do you understand that I am telling you this issue will destroy our marriage if it doesn't get fixed?"" 


Again, he needs to acknowledge that he's heard you.


After that, it's a waiting game. If he cares about you, and he cares about the marriage, you'll see progress. If he doesn't, you won't.


If you don't see any progress, then at that point you need to accept that you can't change him, only yourself. And I would suggest starting the process of leaving the marriage as soon as you're sure he's not willing to step up.

"He's not forgetting, he's just selfish.

From a biological standpoint, women need 20 minutes of foreplay for the vagina to be fully expanded for healthy and comfortable penetrative sex.

Between the lack of foreplay and not making sure you finish, he's really just into sex for his benefit - especially since it's pretty common knowledge that girls have a shorter refractory period than guys which makes it easier for girls to get off more than once a session, but not so simple for guys.  You can talk to him about it: ""Hey, I really feel like our sex life is one sided.  We jump right to penetrative sex, which can actually hurt for me if I haven't had enough foreplay.  Also, you don't seem to care if I finish or not, and that doesn't make me feel desirable.""

If he's any sort of a man at all, he will take your comments to heart, and you two **together** can start working on new things in the bedroom that satisfy the both of you.

He may not give a fuck after you talk to him, and that's your sign to drop him and pick up a man who has no problem satisfying his woman.  They exist, I promise."
No reason to be frustrated with this one. Just let it go. I find nothing wrong with calling him out on cancelling 4 times in a row. He needs to know that its inappropriate even at the level of just being friends. I bet you he makes to the gym on time and regularly. He's either a flake or is juggling other women or he has no sense of what respectful behaviors are. 
Well he's 28. Take it up with the thief himself.
"Hi, thank you very much for the reply. I feel the same way, that he uses the culture card so I am on the losing side, before reading here tho I was trying to at least not stirred up something every time they something like that. 

The Americans I met outside his friend are not like that. I look a little bit exotic I will give that and they not always ask me things about my background country or anything, they usually wait to be more than acquaintance lol.

"When I first read this I thought this might have been an accident. To be honest, I've been there and those birds generally have no qualms about personal space. If he'd been startled, it would have been one thing.

But he deliberately beckoned pigeons over with food, then slapped one of them away as it was already starting to leave. There was literally no reason for it. I'm not going to say it's a dealbreaker, but I would talk to him about it anyway. Since he hunts he may see them as ""just birds"", but they're animals that feel pain too. Even if he thinks that's overly sympathetic, if he respects your feelings he won't do that again. "

"""I'm not asking you to be sad when I tell you I've gotten my period. I'm asking you to support me because I'm sad.""

Come visit at /r/infertility. There's a daily thread on how relationships are affected by this mess and I think you'll get some help there. You'll find that your husband's reaction is all too common. I suspect that guys don't understand our point of view as well because it's not happening to them. They don't get the period every month so they don't have that cyclical sadness and sense of failure. Their emotions are more steady. That's not to say they still don't hurt, they just don't hurt at specific intervals like we do.

I think letting him know that you understand and recognize his feelings but want him to understand and recognize yours in return might help.

For the record, I'm not reading ""is that a bad thing"" as him not wanting a kid. I'm reading it as him not seeing a change from the previous day so doesn't see how this is a negative rather than just more of the same."
"I'm surprised that he was not admitted, what did they say when discharging him? He needs to be in 24/7 care and medicated until his condition stabilises. It's not safe for him or anyone else to be on his own at the moment. Take him back to the doctors and insist they give him some treatment immediately. If he (and you) have any family contact them for support. You are not the person who should be primarily in charge of this, a medical professional is. "
"OP did. 

It gets really bad. I feel sick.

I'd do this but I'd tell him what you are doing after you buy the ticket but before the show. Tell him you bought a ticket for yourself and he can get his on his own. Tell him why. Then let him make his mistake if he wants. 
"Rape doesn't have to be violent or forceful. He followed you into your private bedroom and it seems like he just kept slowly pushing you until he got what he wanted. He didn't care *at all* if you wanted it too. Honestly, you were probably a bit paralyzed with the shock of what was happening. I bet you'd never seen him in a sexual light before. It's very common to freeze up in situations like this, especially when you're young and inexperienced. This was not your fault. "

You need to confront her about what she did and tell her how she has broken your trust. She can cut contact with her ex and work on rebuilding the trust, or she can continue to fight and blame you, in which case you know where her priorities are. "

"Your fiance is not upset that you lied to a cashier.  He is upset that he isn't able to tell when you are lying - basically that your lie came off naturally.  He's either worried that you have lied in the past or will lie in the future, and he would have no way of knowing the truth.  You just need to reassure him that you have been honest with him and will continue being honest, but that he also needs to trust you.  You should also point out that telling a white lie to a stranger is a bit easier than telling a serious lie to someone you care about."
"So, your BF is an emotionally abusive jerk who is taking advantage of you financially? He sounds *lovely*.

"Yeah, I feel so sorry for her. Poor woman has a baby, a toddler, AND a mean, judgmental, condescending husband."
"Ugh the comment about her vagina feeling ""stretched out"" because she used a dildo made my skin crawl. How gross and manipulative.

"Dont blame yoyrself, and also dont overly blame her. There are other powers at work here (NOT the Angel Moroni!) These religions are very psychologically controlling, so I sympathize with the craziness. Nonetheless, it is time for her to sort this out. 

I think you should take sex off the table for now but kind of force some introspection on her part. There are many more Mormon v. Real Life conflicts in your future, so figure out a strategy now. This relationship might not survive. Still give it a shot though!"
"It's just before I start going out with some one, one of the first things I say is ""I'm asexual, so if you want sex, that's not going to happen."" I'll say that I'll hold hands and cuddle, and kiss sometimes, but that's about it. That's my boundary, and some people are comfortable with that, but a lot of people aren't. And that's fine. It's sad that I can't date them, but they have boundaries too. Sometimes we stay friends, sometimes we don't.

What would upset me most is if someone said that the were okay with my boundaries but then hung around me waiting for me to drop them because ""my first explanation wasn't detailed enough"" or they didn't have closure, or really any explanation, tbh. If I found out a friend of mine felt that way, I'd be gutted because that would mean I'd have to lose a friend.

But that doesn't really have much to do with asexuality. That has to more to do with breaking boundaries, which is the issue here. Replace ""asexual"" with ""gay"" to see what I mean.

If you want to learn more about asexuality, google ""An Introduction to asexuality"" by Julie sondra decker or check out asexuality (.org) (I'd link to the sites, but you can't link here)."

"Yep. I was once housesitting and had a bunch of people over. One of them, and I don't know who to this day, broke a figurine that belonged to the owners. Since it was one of my friends that did it, and I couldn't identify who it was to get the money, the onus was on me to replace it. "
How his friend talked to you is bizarre. Also if they are so close why have you never met her? Why was she not at your wedding or are you not included on visits? All of that is very strange.

"He knew it was you. He probably wasn't planning anything, just saw you looking hot at the bar and felt flirty. Now he feels super awkward because it backfired majorly. 

My husband does this to me sometimes at bars, when he's feeling frisky. It's never discussed beforehand or anything, just fun in the moment. It means he's still genuinely attracted to me."
"If your IT friend will get in shit for showing it to you, maybe he could be the one to bring it to HR. Like, ""I saw this employee email and I know this guy &amp; I don't believe it's true.

"You agreed to stay home and then you didn't. You ended up being fine, but it was a day with an extra high potential for danger. I mean, it was the anniversary of the failed coup last year.

Made me wonder if it could be some type of OCD.
"&gt;he was really surprised that I didn't just tell them they were self harm scars.

I'm confused as to why he thinks you should tell complete strangers about something incredibly personal to you when you obviously don't want to. I agree with others that the issue is with the lie and you should work on setting the boundary of 'none of your business' instead of resorting to a lie but I don't understand his logic that you should have told them the details.

You just need to practise on knowing you don't need to answer their questions. Just remind yourself it isn't being rude to say no (because you're basically saying 'no, I'm not telling you')."
"I had a similar issue when my now-wife (then-girlfriend) moved in with me.  I'd been living in the house for over five years, so naturally it was furnished with my stuff, my design choices, my furniture layout, etc.  I made more money, too, which imbalanced things even more.  I, of course, didn't see a problem.

But for her, it didn't feel like *our* house.  It felt like she was living in my house, which sucked for her.  After a few fights/discussions about it, we made some compromises.  We rearranged the kitchen to suit her better.  We did some redecorating, picking out new stuff together.  And I got rid of some of my older stuff.

Ultimately, I don't see how a relationship can work with such an unequal relationship.  Your boyfriend probably feels like my then-girlfriend did - that he's moving into *your* house, rather than creating a home together with you."
"I know how you feel so much, OP. My mom used to have annual ""cleaning binges"" in my room and in my siblings' rooms. It started when I was really little; I'd come home and my room would be totally different and most of my stuff had been given to the salvation army; I had no say in the process. As a teenager it was especially upsetting because family life was really bad and it was my retreat. I'd come home from school and my room would be different, clothes and personal items gone. I'm a writer but I can't even keep a journal because I've hated them since they'd go ""missing"" because there was ""so much garbage that it was tough to tell"" (my room was not messy).

Unfortunately she'd never see what she did as controlling or inappropriate and would stomp around for days because i was ungrateful while my dad sort of ignored it so he didn't have to pick a side. As adults, my sister and I have both confronted her about how traumatic it was with no real results.

You don't need to feign gratitude here. Depending upon how your relationship is with them in general, I'd simply be candid when the issue comes up: it was your space, things you cared about were thrown away, and you feel like it was more about curating your belongings than it was about being ""nice."""
"Honestly, I might get downvoted, but you shouldn't have said anything. If she tastes good 95% of the time, it's not a chronical health issue so you could have let it go. Now she's going to think she tastes awful all of the time."
"Saw your edit. Just ignore inappropriate or weird texts like these. If she nags you saying you never responded, make a sympathetic face and tell her it was such a rude thing to say that you assumed she had sent it while drunk again and she was surely embarrassed, so you were pretending it hadn't happened to spare her feelings.

"As a bisexual woman who's married to a man (and has never been with a woman sexually), I have to say that you can ABSOLUTELY know your sexuality without cheating on your partner. Your wife's therapist is a total crackpot. Your sexuality honestly has nothing to do with your actions and everything to do with your feelings. It can be a confusing thing that takes a long time to come to terms with, but your wife should not have to have sex with anyone else to figure out how she feels (ESPECIALLY since she's seeing a therapist who's trained to help her work through those feelings!!!! How shitty of a therapist do you have to be to openly say ""I can't help you figure out what I'm supposed to help you figure out. Maybe try infidelity?"" JFC)"

"&gt;It ended up taking an hour because he spoke for so long and **he also kept poking his finger super close to my chest** and **did make contact a few times**.

I don't know why you're so worried about being polite when this guy seems to have no problem violating boundaries repeatedly and being extremely rude to others.  Violating personal space (with a fairly aggressive gesture I may add) is crossing a big line and your own personal safety and comfort should be your top priorities over any considerations of politeness in these cases. 

Self confidence and being forward don't come naturally to everyone, but can be practiced and perfected like any other skills.  I think if you work on this, you would feel more comfortable and able in firmly telling these people to leave you alone.  I think there are various methods for working on self confidence, a competent therapist could probably point you in a good direction, or maybe even just a google search :-P.

Additionally, in my experience these people tend to use similar phrases, rhetorical strategies, and even body language.  So, the more it happens, the more you'll be able to recognize the signs that somebody is about to ""witness"" to you and be able to stop the whole thing before it starts, which is the best way to deal with these people, I've found.  That would involve things like changing the subject if it's in a situation you can't leave, or not responding if they're harassing you on the street, or leaving if it's an employee at a store doing it, etc."
"Same, tbh I can kind of see why some parents *would* want to sweep this under the rug, because holy shit this is going to mess this family up big time.

But I'm so glad OPs parents are supporting her with this. I can't imagine how much worse this would be for her if they didn't have her back. "
"Oh dear. This was horrible to read. I feel for you so much. Your boyfriend is purposely hurting you when he can't get his own way. Squeezing your jaw to get you to shut up is a really distressing mental image. I'm so sorry.  This is abuse, pure and simple. There is no excuse for it, no ""well, if you hadn't done X I wouldn't have done Y"". He is trying to manipulate you into feeling responsible for his actions. Which is emotional abuse and means he can't even recognise he has a problem, much less try to do anything about it. 
I agree with the other responses. Please end this, firmly and without second chances. You are a good person for trying to get him to understand how he makes you feel, but I feel he is a lost cause presently. I really don't think you are safe in this relationship right now, get as far away from him as you can. Don't let him wheedle his way back into your affections with empty promises. Good luck, stay strong. "
Whoa ho- his mom did you a huge favor.  You don't want to introduce the dreaded asshole gene into your excellent lineage. 
"&gt;The problem with confronting Matt is the fact that about a month ago his father passed away. So now confronting him directly may feel harsh and hurt his feelings.

Who cares?  Matt is a moron who doesn't care about anyone else's feelings, why should you consider his?  Sometimes assholes need to be told they're assholes.  I want to punch this guy and I've never even met him. 

Your BF should tell Matt that he is NEVER to touch his lunch again, and demand that his boss take this seriously. Pranks are for idiots."

They probably talk about what a sucker he is behind his back. He needs to go no contact with these users!
"You are not selfish!

Feeding and clothing are the bare necessities that a parent can provide and if he is making you feel like you owe him for those things, sorry, but your dad is a piece of shit. 

I also feel like 1500 euros would be a lot of money and I would not hesitate to spend it on myself. And knowing my parents- my mum would be happy for me and my dad would probably come up with solid investment advice. 

You owe your parents absolutely nothing!

Do not set yourself on fire just to keep someone else warm!"
"Change the conversation. Instead of showing where she has to cut back, suggest you both get an allowance for whatever you want to spend it on. The other money is put towards bills/food/date night. 

So for example:
$1000 for bills
$200 for food
$200 for incidentals like toilet paper and the like
$100 for date nights
$100 for allowance per adult 

That way she sees you guys get the same amount of fun money and she has to budget appropriately. Then she has a limit on what she can spend instead of feeling like she has to get things approved by you.

"You really need to look at this from your mom's perspective. I think the money is clouding your judgement.

You don't seem to regret how you treated your mother. I know you mention the lack of contact as the motive behind your dad cutting your sisters out. It doesn't sound like you made any increased effort to help your mother in her times of need. 

She accepted that you were an adult and allowed to make their own decisions. You are an adult and need to realize your actions have consequences. Honestly if your mom had brought up about how you chose your dad bothering her - would you have done anything?  

Edit to add - did you help her when she was sick? How about the funeral planning? Because that sounds like you let your sisters take care of that while you waited for the will to hand you money and a house. Maybe your sisters wouldn't have even let you buy them out - would you try to force a sale to get your way? I know you didn't get a part of it - that could be why."
"Their gesture didn't cause a fight, the step-brother stealing it did."
"So your boyfriend claimed he saw a video of you, doesn't believe you when you say you didn't know about it, and can't show you the video because he randomly decided to delete his browser history? Honestly, sounds kind of fishy to me.

"I'm on your husband's side. You have a long record of continuously getting behind the wheel and driving. You have a history of getting black out drunk. To top it all off, you're a lightweight and you are getting smashed off of only 3-4 glasses (which means that you aren't the type of person who can have a drink or two and still function as an adult)."
"Look, relationships are about supporting each other through the tough times. It's not always going to be sunshine and rainbows. It's probably a good time now for you to work on yourself and then find someone who will be there for you and support you.

"Ugh I'm sorry. I would feel so gross if I were in your situation. 

Makeup, no ID, and a screwdriver... I don't know a lot about prostitutes but common sense tells me it sounds like that's who he brought there.

"Hi.   I used to be just like your husband.   It drove my partner crazy but we worked together to put a small set of rules in place to help me out because its a delicate situation. 

For obligitory liars like us its not on purpose,  its a verbal flinch if you will,  like a sneeze almost.   It usually pops out imidiatly followed by a confused or embarassed look by us especially when we realize weve said something stupid and obviously untrue.   It really effected not just my romance but my other relationships too. 

The most helpful thing to me to recover from and get by behavior under my control -and this might be very hard to hear:  let your husband off the hook.    Now dont just let him lie all the time but watch how you word things.   Instead of a ""I know youre lying"" treat it like an accident and Give Him a Way Out.  Examples for us includ

Me  (holding an apple)

Partner:  ""are you holding an apple?"" 

Me: ""no""

Partner:   ""oh,  did you mean to say that?"" 

Me:  ""no I didnt,  I just answered before I could think."" 

------- 

This sort of thing is a question and not an accusation which makes us want to double down hard on a lie because now we are upset and we will get worse at lying and more desperate the more we are (rightfully) accused and questioned. 

Treat it like an addiction of sorts.   This is one that with a little love and support can be overcome.   There will be behavioral relapses and little ticks on the way.   He wont be able to get past this if he doesnt want to,  and he wont want to unless he feels safe and supported...  thats really obnoxious isnt it? 

 I also like having something that is a verbal safety blanket for me where  thats my freezone of lies.   Give him a safeword where he can lie as much as he can about umbrellas and if he gets tripped up in public or with you he can use a line about umbrellas just to take a deep breath and start over.  this way theres a safe outlet and escape if needed with this mental retraining. 

As for the sunscreen trap...  he probably deserved it sure.   But he has a mental block and I think you knew he would lie because you know he lies and wanted a ""gotcha!""  moment.   these moments can feel prettt satisfying sure but they shouldnt ever be desired with a spouse.   if you'd rather try to trick or catch a spouse in the act of something then you're kind of fanning thr flames rather than stamping them out.   Next time just lead that you feel hurt because you KNOW he isnt doing the sunscreen.   This is a statement and doesnt allow for him to answer with a lie.   He could try...  but it wont work. 
Try to use a lot of personally identifying statements.   I feel.   I want.   I need.   Not  yOU Did or You didnt.   these are upsetting statements to hear. 

If he doesnt want to get beter then you know what to do girl.   but chances are like me whenever someones realized he has a problem theyve gotten mad and taken it personally instead of recognizing it as a mental block he needs help with.   I think a soft convo will help.   get some snacks or a nice quiet moment and ask him about this stuff. 

i want you two to succeed.   It sounds like youve come a long way together and are a good match.   It sounds like you both love your little one and want each other to be happy which is probably why he lies.  So many people told me I would always be just a liar and a one upper and the words stung.   but my husband and I got through this with a communication overhaul and I think you two can do this too."
"As a SAHM I can relate so much to this. 

My husband gets to go out and work. He gets to interact with adults and have adult conversations and all he has to worry about is himself. 
I'm at home with two kids under three, watching Blippi, minions movies, playing with cars and wrestlers, counting to ten 1000 times a day, doing flash cards of animals and working out which animal makes which noise. Mentally, it's draining that I'm doing this basic, elementary day to day. Yes, it's helping our kids develop and learn, but my brain is fried. 

My husband gets home from work and he's tired. He wants to eat, have a shower, spend time with the kids and either have sex or watch an episode of GoT with me. I want to talk. I want to talk about anything and everything. About how I love and hate blippi at the same time. How our kids are developing and what areas they need to improve in. 

I ask my husband to help me and I get the ""I've been at work all day"" card played. I hate that card. I'm not on holidays. I'm not out shopping. I'm in the house, with our kids, cleaning up shitty nappies and making 400 snacks a day. Don't tell me you've been at work all day. So have I. 

My body is no longer firm. My hips are so damn wide and no amount of exercise will change that. I have not felt pretty or even remotely attractive in months. My eyebrows were last done in January. 

When I eventually go back to work, I'll most likely have to start from the bottom and work my way up again. Something I did prior to kids but I've now been out of the game for so long, I'll be at the bottom of the barrel. 

I cook, clean, educate, entertain, care for and love these kids with everything I have. But I have thought about my life prior to being a mum. My lunch break at work I could and often would, go and buy a brand new handbag over $200. I could go to the movies or out with friends or out to lunch whenever I wanted. All my time was just that - MY time. 

At night, once the kids are asleep, the husbands lunch is packed for the next day and the house is clean, that's my down time. I stay up until 11.30pm-1am most nights because it's the only time I have to myself. I don't have a kid climbing on me. I don't have a load of washing to fold. I don't have a meal to cook. I can just be me, the woman I was BEFORE I was ""mummy"". 

Personally, for me it's something I've come to just accept. This is who I am. This is my life. I am mummy. I am the kids safe place. I am the one who loves them more than anyone or anything. I am the one who is always around. 

In three weeks I'll be having my hair, eyebrows and nails done. I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am for that. Maybe your wife needs that. Something to look forward too that focuses on her. A little pamper day. It's not much, but it's more than what she's having at the moment. 

Underneath it all, she loves those kids and wouldn't change having them for the world. She's overwhelmed. She's a mum and it's totally normal. Just remind her that she's doing a great job and do what you can to ease her load. "
"This, OP. You are being coerced into sex by this blackmailing criminal. It's rape.

"Can I tell you how crazy impressed I am with you? Most people wouldn't be able to react as maturely as you did, especially at 19 with their first girlfriend. You did absolutely the right thing. Taking her back would tell her that she can keep you on the backburner in the future too. You deserve way better.

Yes, you *can* get over this. Look how much your girlfriend wants you back; she realizes you're a catch. Other girls do too. It'll take some time, but you'll be over her soon enough."
"I say stand up to her and confront her plain and simple. Passive aggressive people need this, it puts them on the spot and makes them uncomfortable and face their behavior head on. Ask to speak with her, mention the email you sent when you were 8, tell her the way she is acting is immature and not helpful to the family, and leave the ball in her court. Then you can know you've tried, if she still acts the same way it's just going to make her look like a fool."

"&gt;So I decided to try adding leftover to dinner gradually over time.

He tells you he doesn't want to eat leftovers, so you decide to lie to him and sneak it in.  That is incredibly dishonest and wrong.  You are betraying his trust and this will destroy the relationship.

A relationship is nothing without trust.

&gt;Ever since then, he have been cooking for himself and refuse to eat anything I made for him! It is costing us a lot more and it is getting even more stressful and frustrating!

That's a consequence to your actions.  Live with it.

&gt;Is there anything I can do?

How about you listen to him and stop doing things he hates...?

If this is a dealbreaker, then leave."
"Date night!!

You choose this weekend.  He chooses next.  Repeat.  The rules are you have to stay out past 11pm."
"To be honest I don't know why they are so uptight about it.  They could have joked it off. 

""Yeah I'm a drug dealer but only for pot so I'm a pot dealer.""  I feel like his friends are oddly hyper sensitive.

Yeah they never paid for the alcohol, they did steal it.  At least *own up to it*.  Gosh.  They were in *college*.  They even mentioned they did 'stupid things.'  "
"Why are you letting him tell you when to eat?  Like, feed yourself and if he misses a meal and gets hungry, surely as a grown man that is a problem he can solve for himself, right?"
"You've done a real disservice to your marriage by allowing yourself to think (and share with us!) that your wife has to ""practically beg for sex"" because you're ""not even attracted to her anymore."" You got THAT far without discussing this with her?! You think to yourself ""she has to practically beg for it"" about a real human person you love?

Man, that's cold blooded, straight up. You need to knock that off. If you're so cold you make her beg for it, I promise she's noticed something and likely feels really shitty about it. No one likes begging for sex. No one.

You need to rewind your mindset, because you're saying pretty disrespectful shit about your wife. I appreciate you're dissatisfied, but that's not an excuse for the flinty, callous perspective you're doubling down on in this post. You need to soften your heart, see her positive qualities, and try opening your mouth to talk with her about this stuff before this resentful condescension eats you alive.

Given how you articulated your concerns to us, I'd say you should confess this shit to her in the context of a mediated conversation with a couples' counselor. If I bore and raised two of your babies in two years and you had the nerve to lay this kind of headdtrip on me before we were out of the new-baby woods, I'd go absolutely bananas on your ass."
"You have known her 9 months. She's 38. If she hasn't traveled yet, that's on her, and I'm sure, on her Cocaine habit. 

She is definitely being intentionally manipulative. A nice hike and spa weekend sounds fantastic to me."

"Well.. this does not bode well for your future.  He's ignoring you while you are carting around his children? That's ... really not a good sign.  You really need to lay a reality smack-down on him. You should not be begging for his help. It' snot ""Help"". It's him meeting the bare minimum responsible duties as a husband and father.  Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do to make him care.  The fact that he doesn't is ... really not good."
"&gt;  and introducing political sentiments here when there are thousands of other subreddits for it is quite ridiculous IMO.

And when it's ignored by people who don't go to those subs, the people who instead come here for advice might find their access limited.

It's a reality everyone needs to face, and this is a perfect way to do it without disrupting the sub."
"&gt;I said something like ""don't make this about you"" and left.

Good for you!  Him repeatedly apologizing, ignoring your requests for space, and breaking down were all because he wanted to make himself feel better, not you.  He wanted to alleviate his own guilt but didn't care if you actually felt better or not.  When we want to make our partners feel better, we do what they ask for, not ignore what they ask for and do what we want.

&gt;I'm not sure how I can proceed or make it better.

Honestly, I wouldn't do anything.  Your boyfriend acted incredibly selfish during the whole ordeal; do not enable his selfishness by apologizing.  He needs to realize that.

"
"Five bucks and a bottle of Angel's Envy says he wouldn't act like this with another guy.

(obvious bet is obvious)"
That's pretty sexist. Any kid is going to want/need validation and affirmation from their parents. A boy will internalize this just as easily as a girl. 
"This is a good option if you want to put a bit of distance between yourself and this guy quickly, and prevent him from easily following you to wherever you're staying before you can catch a flight back home. As long as you have your US passport, you don't need any other special documents to get into Hong Kong, while Chinese mainland residents will."
"Thank you for putting a name to this dynamic for me! I've been pushed into the role of ""overfunctioner"" and I'm not sure what to do about it - at some point, if I don't play the enabler it has dramatic effect on my *own* life - but at least this gives me a way to approach the conversation with my spouse."
I think counselling would really help. If you think about it at the moment you're in a room full of strangers talking about your feelings.
"* He's lied about her in the past
* He booked a hotel for her the night he was supposedly out of town working
* He knows her email password
* He's deleted messages between them

The answer is staring you right in the face. I'm sorry that you have to deal with this."
"Haha, on our first year of dating ""anniversary"" my now wife wrote me a touching card that included the sentence ""I don't think I could ever be mad at you."".  That phrase has become a bit of a punchline after 3 years together and a handful of serious disagreements.  You've dated for 6 months, you're still in the honeymoon phase.  Give it a little longer."
I can't wrap my head around it either and I just keep coming back to the idea he doesn't like me very much and doesn't want to spend time with me.
I think being a bit thrown is understandable. Have you been in touch with her much lately? Maybe she didn't know how to bring the subject up?
This sounds like a small problem laying on a heap of other problems. Does he usually diminish your efforts around the house? Or with other things?
"the level of their hypocricy here is staggering

This is probably not the moment for smart ass remarks about that though (""The Prophet fucked Aisha when she was 9 and you were Ok with THAT"")"
"Are you sure he is getting fired, cause sounds like he is quitting. I just have a hard time believing you would get fired for rushing off to the hospital where your GF might be dying of meningitis. Most people seem understanding of that."
"Wow. No, absolutely not normal.

Has she ever acted like this before or is this an escalation of previous behavior? Like, maybe she's gotten really angry before but you brushed it off or maybe she's gotten physical before but it didn't really hurt so you didn't ""count"" it.

If this is escalation, get out NOW. She's testing your boundaries with how physical she can get. Domestic violence from women is severely underreported because many men feel like they should just be able to ""take it"" or they ignore DV warning signs because the escalation behavior hasn't been drilled into them like it has for women or they dismiss early warning signs because it wasn't damaging.

Make no mistake there is ZERO excuse for her laying hands on you. If she's unstable enough to have had a break with reality and has uncontrollable actions that is WAY above your pay grade and she needs help and to focus inward to resolve those issues before she gets into any relationship.

You're doing her a severe disservice by staying.

Look up loveisrespect "
"When you talk to her about it don't frame it as the group being bad and you don't see why she needs so much social interaction during the week, that's a recipe for trouble because it puts her on the defensive.

Instead focus on how it affects your relationship: I feel like we don't get much quality time together, plans that I want to have with you get cancelled or rescheduled, you don't feel like a priority in her life anymore, etc. and see how she responds to that. Hopefully you guys can come to a compromise about spending time together and not having everything be about running. It's difficult when your partner's priorities shift or they have a big lifestyle change. Part of a happy relationship is rolling with the punches and being able to communicate and compromise about it. "
"Google ""You Should've Asked.""  By not remembering he's forcing you to manage the chores he's supposed to perform by instructing him to do it while also doing all of the chores you're supposed to perform.  Of course you're resentful - he's not taking responsibility for the trash the way you are taking responsibility for the bathrooms if you have to remind him to do it every time.  He's not doing his part.  It's his job to figure out how to do it without being reminded by you."
"You are not heartless. It seems your issue was with her not communicating and not including you in relationship decisions - financial, emotional (that is, you could have been supportive re: the abortion, had you known about it). 

The consequences of her not communicating to her partner is she no longer has that partner. "
"&gt; she also had affectively stolen my FWB

This is not a thing, you're still possessive of your ex.

Yeah, I think maybe if you guys had tried to have an actual friendship in the aftermath of your relationship, it might be a good and happy and auspicious thing for Brad and Lisa to get together at this point, like everyone's past it and they can explore something together, but continuing having sex with your ex in that time period, even if you guys dated other people (ostensibly strangers) there's still a degree of possessiveness in your closer circle."
"After hearing the context of the other two times he put everything down to get over to your aid quick.... You seriously have to put that into the actual post and not as a reply to other comments for people to dig in for... I got to say I would have done the same. Let's be honest those two things you described in the comment are like life threatening situations.....

I mean... Fuck if I hear something similar is happening to my partner I'll drop whatever I'm doing and get to scene ASAP. Partner &gt; World. 

Yeah I think what you are upset at has nothing to do with this... Spit it out. I don't think it has anything to do with ""saving"" or ""extra stress"". If something much worse was going on, having a great job, house and etc would mean nothing without my partner... I don't see why that's the only reason he would not be perfect for you. Don't know what you are trying to prove here. Seriously do you really love him? Cause it looks like you are trying to find an excuse to blame him for. Why?"
"You just honestly have to tell him to cut it out.  
  
I mean, do so as nice as possible, but that's not very cool. Just next time he says something be like ""When you say stuff like that, no matter if you're joking or not, after a while it starts to upset me babe.""  
  
Something to that effect. "
"&gt;I am very shy and nonconfrontational to a fault

This is an unhealthy and potentially dangerous trait, especially for a woman. 

You need to practice this. A lot. As another poster said, practice in a mirror a few times a day for a few weeks so the words are natural to you. 

Also, listen to My Favorite Murder podcast. Their motto is ""Fuck Politeness"" because in almost all the women in the murders they talk about were polite to a fault."
"Hmm...It appears that you didn't listen to the previous advice given to you when you first posted about this months ago. Oh yes, I remembered your story clearly because I couldn't believe that you still wanted to work things out with a boyfriend who was willing to let you take on such a financial risk on your own. I'm not even going to bring up his parents because there are more important things. 

Serious question- if you do sell your home and buy a new place- will your name be alone on that new property? I mean...technically it was purchased with all the proceeds of *your* initial home so it's only fair.

I'm not going to tell you to break up with him....But you need some serious space to evaluate why you're willing to sacrifice so much financially on someone who appears to be doing well on their own...And who apparently doesn't like to share nor compromise. Your feelings for him are seriously clouding your judgement. Be smart and respect yourself. "
"I would say stay out of it, except that if he is sexually abusing other children, your parents need a heads up so he isn't ever left alone with other kids, not even just in another room for 5 minutes. 

I would tell your brother he needs to tell your parents (the child's grandparents) or you will. 

You can't be so concerned with keeping the family peace that you risk letting neighborhood children be molested while they are watching him."
"&gt; and my reactions definitely were in the wrong and should not be taken lightly. But be reminded it's a two way street, and making unnecessary comments to your loved one when they are doing nothing that inconveniences you in any manner is unwarranted and unfair.

This is a tiny step away from ""I hit you because I love you"""
We live in the digital age. Martyn spent all night at this club and couldn't have bothered to take one picture with his phone for you.
This feels like a good time to start some couples therapy and open up the lines of communication. Clearly he's struggling with something to due with his ex wife. Not talking about it won't solve anything. 
"ok, I'm really confused about how she went about this...*why* did she go behind your back to get the abortion? having done that, why tell you about it at all? What was the point of that? did she explain why?

edit: I mean, the only thing that makes sense is that she was afraid you wouldn't want her to have an abortion. "
"The fact that he's lost both of those jobs because of what you listed below is mind-boggling...even on a day when massively important meetings are taking place, family emergencies like the one's you've mentioned are a completely valid reason to leave."
"So I've read all of your stuff here and would like to break it down in simple language:

&gt;  I am upset because a good friend is being abused by her boyfriend.

You have absolutely no proof of this.

&gt; he was so insecure he wouldn't let her go to a gala with her friend already had plans with.

You have absolutely no proof of this.

&gt; he made her leave from an event that she was really looking forward to, got all dressed up for, and would meet really important people that will help propel her career.

You have absolutely no proof of this.

&gt; he is deciding who she can and can't text after meeting someone for a few fucking minutes.

You have absolutely no proof of this.

Hope this helps."
"People saying ""parents are people too"", seriously?  Yeah they're people, and just like the rest of the population, some of them are worthless turds.  Your mom sounds like somebody who had no business having kids to begin with.  There are just some people who shouldn't get to inflict their special kind of depravity on kids.  From the information you've given us, it sounds like she's one of these people.

Are you and your sister planning on going away to college?  Do either of you work?  Is your dad in a position to take responsibility for you?  You're both very close to adulthood.  I would say any option that gets you out of there is worth looking at, but if school was in your plans, don't compromise your dreams just to get away a few months earlier.  Either way, very soon you will be in a position to leave this woman where she belongs...in YOUR past."
Shes using her anxiety as a way to manipulate and abuse you. Thats not healthy for you or your relationship with her. You need to leave.
"Ignore it - he has access to all your work info, your contacts, etc.  He's in the same field as you, so he could sabotage your future.

Learn this:  his many attempts at contact (coffee, bar, dinner) were too much for a short period of time.  The red flags were there way before he asked you to a hotel.  But that's just wisdom that comes with experience.

I'm all for exposing sexual harassment but you have no idea how vindictive this guy is or if his wife is delusional enough to believe every lie he tells her, no matter how outrageous.  If this was a coworker, client or vendor I think you could have some recourse with your employer's protection or co-workers who know the personalities involved.  At this point it was like an encounter with a sleazy guy in a bar you met somewhere who gave you his business card and then tried to hit on you."
"I don't think its unusual AT ALL. my family has always been close, and the kids have always gone somewhere else to play. My kids go downstairs to play with their cousins all the time when we get together."
"My husband carried something similar in Iraq. Roughly 30 people or so have asked me personally if he ever killed anyone in Iraq. None of them like my answer ""I don't know, I've never asked."" We've been together for almost 10 years, if he wanted to talk about it he would have. That's not my scab to tear."
"If you're not comfortable with direct confrontation, defer a little bit. ""I have a few other obligations on Sunday and while I swapped some plans around to make the party, I won't be arriving until after it starts. So sorry."""
"It's completely reasonable for you not to want to be around a breed that terrifies you. You had traumatic experiences. If this were about any other trauma trigger, people would be saying the boyfriend is in the wrong.
Your ultimatum doesn't stop him from fostering animals. Someone else can take the breed you're uncomfortable with and he can foster a different dog. It's not unreasonable and does not bar him from helping animals at all. If he's unwilling to compromise for your comfort, then fuck him."
[removed]
"That is what worries me. I wish I could say I don't believe it could ever happen, but know that he has the capacity to do it then I can't rule it out. 

I think if he showed remorse for his actions then it might be different, but he told me he doesn't regret anything he did. In his mind his brother got what he deserved. "
She should also probably call the cops and charge him. 
"Funny, the last time you posted this, you had a lot more details which made you look like a creepy, controlling ""nice guy"" who is massively overstepping his professional relationship with a coworker by trying to save her from an imaginary abusive relationship based on your own twisted conclusions. Luckily, it's still in your post history so everyone should take a look. 

She told you to leave her alone. Do that."
"This is a bizarre marriage. He gets turned off by his wife texting him if he's jerking it to porn? What is wrong with him. And what is wrong with her. What is wrong with this marriage? It sounds like they barely know each other and honestly, I'd be fed up by now if I was OP and husband not only does he have to consume porn an excessive amount of time but he also doesn't seem very bright doing the same mistake over and over. Then not being able to laugh about it or shrug it off leads me to think he has a lot of issues regarding himself and his, what seems to be, porn addiction. Seek some help all of y'all. "
"I just had this happen to me!

Someone I've known for years  randomly ended our friendship a few winters back for the same reason your ex-friend gave you: ""that our lives were going in different directions and there was too much rivalry between us."" I was so confused. It was a total bullshit excuse, but okay. I don't need toxic people like that in my life, anyways. It hurt, but I moved on.

Yesterday, she messaged me out of the blue and for some strange, naive reason, I took the bait. I said, ""Hey, how are you?"" Yeah, big mistake. All she wanted to do was brag about how well she was doing and gave 0 shits about me. And after prattling on and on and on about her new job and living arrangements, I said, ""That's great, good for you."" She then cut off the conversation and left. Radio silence so far after that.

What did I learn from this experience? That after years of not talking to each other, this old pal of mine was *still* hung up on the idea we were in ""competition"" with each other. 

My advice is don't take the bait!!!!!!! There's a reason people like that should be your ex-friends. "
"So tell your aunt and uncle that he takes too long to get ready and if he's not ready by a certain time, you can't give him a ride.  

Also, it's fucking nasty that he's leaving semen on the toilet seat.  Someone needs to tell him to clean that shit up."
"&gt; I know this is a mess that someday I'm going to have to deal with as power of attorney.

It's pretty simple. Tell them that if they do this, you have no interest in being power of attorney anymore. That you are going to 100% uninvolve yourself in their legal and financial affairs.

That's all you need to do. Your parents are grown-ups. If they make shitty decisions, *they* get to live with the consequences. That's not your responsibility.

It is fully possible for you to have a relationship with them without being so fully entangled in their financial affairs. Just draw the boundary and say you're not dealing with it and you're not helping and you don't want to hear about it."
"That's a beautiful, beautiful idea! As a gay man, I'd be so happy to have a brother who did something like that for me. 

Instead of going to the wedding, give them a lavish gift if you have the means. Pay for their honeymoon. Or plan to visit after and host a dinner for then and their close friends. Something to show that you care. 

You might also share your secret plan with him. That could help soften the blow. "
"It is not ""understandable"" that he shouted at you and broke your things. You're an adult, and you can stay up as late as you want. Get out of this while you still can, please. "
"Agreed. Frequency will increase now since he has seen there are no repercussions for when he flips out and acts like a wanker. 

OP needs to end this. Think of your mental health. Can you deal with the stress and anxiety everytime he does this? "
"When you keep your life more private then there's more intrigue; people will personally contact you to ask what's going on.

If you overshare your life on social media, people don't feel the need to personally contact you as they probably feel like they already know way too much about your life.

To be honest, most straight-laced sort of people find others oversharing their lives on social media annoying. So they stop appreciating your posts. Cut back on how much you post and I'd bet more people will reach out and contact you or be more responsive to things you send them "
180K at age 33 is killing it. Even in Seattle. Tell your wife to get a job if she wants more money. Also tell her to stop comparing your lifestyles to lifestyles of dual income families if you're not one. Geez.
"You're a sixteen year-old with anxiety. He's twice your age and you describe him being there as babysitting you. He's been babysitting you for a long time. 

He took groomed you and took advantage of you. 

Are you in treatment for your anxiety? Do you have a therapist you could talk to about this? "
"Oh, OP. I am so, so, so, so sorry. That is literally, objectively terrible. *hug*

Since you can't cut your mom out, I would spend as much time away from her as possible. Tell her the bare minimum. Make yourself an uninteresting topic. 

Your body is not ugly or shameful. It's who you are. Your mom is not a happy person if she thinks this way. Remember that. This is someone who has problems trying to bring others down. Misery loves company, and it's pretty damn good at trapping people. "
"""Dear Diary,

Today I came home from camp and discovered my mother and sister had re-arranged my room, decorated it in their style, not mine, and, worst of all, thrown away some of my possessions. I feel betrayed and unloved. I guess I can't trust my mother or sister anymore.""

Then don't hide it - leave it where they can find it."
"&gt; I really don't understand why he doesn't trust me or let me know.  

It has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with his own healing. The best thing you can do is hug the shit out of him, tell him you love him no matter what so you're willing to listen if he ever needs to get it off his mind, and encourage him to talk to somebody who helps retired vets and law enforcement with troubling things on their mind when he feels it's necessary. 

You will make it worse for him if you pry. You are not entitled to the traumas of his past, and forcing it out of him for your own curiosity is not a loving decision on your part."
"I think it's not that weird. Relax. Lots of children experiment with sexuality.

"Anyone can be a good partner when things are going well. What good is a partner who can't function when things don't go perfectly? What happens when you guys have a kid who gets really sick or you get laid off in 8 years? 

There isn't much you can do to change the way he acts but I will give you the comfort of knowing that the way you feel about it is totally justified. I married someone like that, I didn't see it because nothing bad happened while we were dating. Living with a completely disconnected person is so much more lonely than actually living alone is. Issues due to kids make it so much worse too, definitely consider not having kids unless the issue can be addressed. "
You're doing exactly what you should do. Relying on friends and family in a time of need is what helps you get through tough moments. I'm not sure what your boyfriend expects you to do but you're doing the right thing. He needs to be more supportive instead of telling you that you're doing the wrong thing. 
"Asking your GF if she'd be okay with being ditched for another girl as a wedding date is one of the all time bad ideas, even on a sub known for horrible ideas. "
Be sure to include that detail when you tell the wife.
I agree. Second hand smoke kills. They shouldn't have to be exposed to all of your father's nasty trashy behavior just because he's your dad. Your wife knows what she's talking about here. 
"Yeah, she's terrified you're going to dump her and go find someone fertile.

OP, if you're not going to leave her over this, reassure her. Tell her repeatedly that it's okay and you're not going anywhere, you love her."
"As another Hispanic female. I think we all know that Hispanic parents have different rules for their sons than their daughters. 

It's just how it is. I saw it happen in my family all the time. Boys were allowed to do whatever they wanted and should a girl try anything they would lose their minds. 

What they are doing is not okay and you need to stand up for yourself, are you tide to them financially? "
"1)  Split everything 50/50.  Your income is your income, her income is her income, bills get split evenly.

2)  Take your incomes.  If collectively you earn 5,000 a month, and bills are 3,000, then you both devote 60% of your income to expenses.  For the lower income partner, they'll be paying less but still 60%, for the high income parter will be paying more but still 60%.  The other 40% is your ""fun money"".  

3)  Combine everything.  You are a unit.  

Pick one.  Agree on it with SO."
"No, it's not wrong, this is how normal people function in the dating scene."
Do you really think he'd start looking inward at himself? He sounds like a grade-a asshole.
"Agreed! That's the equivalent of ""nice guys"" saying that since a girl slept with a guy with a big dick, they'll never be the same again.

It's a load of horse crap. Vaginal muscles naturally contract back to normal after any sort of sex. Maybe someone needs to teach OP's boyfriend sex ed. He's basically shaming /u/nigeriafaggots over her use of sex toys, when he's the insecure one."
"**Tell him NOW**. Every hour you wait is one Monica can swoop in and tell him her story first.

If you tell him first you can tell him the truth and he should believe you. If Monica tells him first she can mix in whatever lies she wants and you can't correct them since you are a liar who never choose to come clean. You will have zero credibility since you already lied to cover it up and now caught again you are probably lying again. 

Seriously waiting is putting your relationship in danger. Log off and talk to him thus minute.

"Yes, it is absolutely not healthy to put the burden of your happiness and mental and emotional well-being on one person you've known for less than six months (calling it 'nearly half a year' was creative though).

You need therapy. You need coping skills to deal with your anxiety and disappointment about your life situation that don't involve another person. You need to develop a plan, with your therapist, for mental health care so you are able to do things like make friends, make art, and find joy in life. You are setting yourself up to be absolutely devastated by the end of this relationship, and you are also possibly accelerating the end of the relationship by leaning this heavily on her."
"It's weird. I mean, you guys were indeed wandering around the house, but I don't know why they weren't just like 'hey guys this is off limits.' Maybe he thought you were getting high or something. You'd think that doors would be locked if people weren't allowed to be in a certain area. 

If the bride/groom were the ones to set the edict, I'd imagine they expect some kind of apology (though it is unwarranted in my opinion.)  IDK if your brother is the type, but I'd absolutely want to clear the air with them because it's just so bizarre. I would send an email along the lines of 

""Hey bride &amp; groom, I wanted to clear the air after your uncle asked us to leave the wedding. I'm not sure what you thought was going on- we were wandering around the property and didn't know the farmhouse was off limits to wedding guests. We're sorry about that. I didn't expect this to be such a problem, and I apologize for causing any issues at your party. I was a little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, and would like to know more specifically what I did wrong, because I'm left a little hurt and confused. Congratulations on your wedding."""
"Yep. I just want to add, currently, you did absolutely nothing wrong.

But heres where a lot of people make mistakes. She'll come back and say ""no I'm totally fine being FWB"".. because in her mind, if she keeps banging you, one day you'll realize how amazing she is and make her your girlfriend. And then what happened at your party will happen again.

She's basically like a nice guy (tm). Orbiting until one day you just suddenly realize she's the one.

Do NOT take her back. Tell her its over and DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH HER AGAIN."
How would you feel if they went to another country instead? Maybe tell him you really want the trip to France to be a thing for you 2. Would you be ok if he went on vacation elsewhere?
"You can ask him to leave because he broke the rules of your house by interfering with your private work after being asked not to, and he's become an entitled pest.

He isn't your second son, he's an adult who is acting like a child and making you do all the adulting. I hope for his sake his parents lay down ground rules in their home and lay out punishments for breaking them, or he'll never grow up and learn to stand on his own two feet.

He certainly wasn't much else besides a bother!"

"Asexual here, please it's best to break it off.  You guys are sexually incompatible.  If sex is important to you, end it.  And I must say it was pretty shitty of her for holding out this long to tell you all this.  Just because she's asexual, doesn't mean she should withold this crucial information from you.  Even though she never really knew what term to use, her faking every orgasm and not enjoying sex shoulda been something she shoulda brought up beforehand. 

otherwise, you could go to counseling but I'm not sure if you can get over her feelings about sex.  Her feelings won't change from counseling. "

Her emotions are all over the place and Mike's proximity to her dead husband is way too close to be healthy for her right now.  Her ability to make critical distinctions is going to be very poor right in these early weeks.  These are not the right and healthy circumstances to start a brand new romantic relationship, especially with her dead husband's best friend.  She needs to work through her grief with the therapist and get on her own two feet first.  She also has a young child to think of and how damned confusing will this be for the kid.  She can revisit possibilities down the road.

I know you can't make her do anything, but for the love of everything, offer some sound perspective because she sounds like she's flailing and acting out of pure survival instinct (terrified of being alone)."

No is a complete answer. You may ask your mom for help here. Explain to your mom that the phone is yours, you paid for it, and that you have no intention of giving it away for free- to your niece or anyone else. Tell your sister the same. 

Start establishing boundaries with your niece. Heres some handy go-to phrases: 

""You're being very rude. I don't allow people to speak to me that way."" Then disengage. Walk away. 

""Niece, if you're going to speak to me that way, this conversation is over."" Walk away. 

""Niece, you do not get to demand that another person hand over their belongings for no reason. Its rude and entitled."" Walk away. 

Or just ignore her. ""Sister, you daughter is being a turd. Deal with her."" Then walk away. 

Edit: In regards to the phone, I would be frank with your niece. ""Why would I give you anything when you treat me poorly? You call me names, yell at me, and haven't even ASKED me to give you the phone. I don't give favors or MY things to people who treat me terribly."""

When you say something like ""he's been bad twice, but he's great the rest of the time,"" that's like going around with a nail in your head saying, ""I feel great, except for this huge nail in my head.""

"The great things about friends of a boyfriend is that they don't have to be your friend. You don't ever have to see them or interact with them if you don't want to.

And if your boyfriend asks you why you leave every time they come around or why you refuse their visits etc you can explain 


a. His friends are jerks etc 

B. You'd much rather cultivate your own friendships, which is super important in a relationship. separate friends are good! 



You also have to sit your boyfriend down and talk to him about this situation. Jason has a history  of behaving like this and at this point you don't have a ""bf's friend problem"" you have a boyfriend problem. If any of my friends were rude to my boyfriend and my boyfriend didn't like it I wouldn't hesitate to tell my friend their behaviour is not on. Also does your boyfriend speak the same way?

"The only thing that sticks out to me is that sometimes you're ""really hungry"" at night and you don't eat, and sometimes you go to bed early just to help you obey the ""rule.""

To me, this sounds like you might have a slightly unhealthy relationship with food. It's having an impact on your day-to-day life. A small impact, sure, but still an impact. I would say that being so afraid of eating past 7 that you cut hours out of your day is unhealthy. Not like, ""bang the eating-disorder gong"" or anything like that, but it is unusual.

Have you tried experimenting with your dinners? You said a ""huge"" dinner would make you feel bloated in the morning, so now you have a ""very small"" one. What about a medium-sized dinner? Or a normal sized one? What if you play around with what you eat (I know some people feel bloated after carbs and dairy, but what about protein and veggies)? 

I think there's a middle ground you could try and find. Not necessarily for your husband's sake, but for your sake! Think of all those hours you could get back - hours awake instead of asleep, or hours happy instead of ""miserable,"" to use your word, and craving food.

He was tormented by it for years, and he finally broke down and told his brother, who also knew. They thought their sibling was dead and that no one ever spoke of it and they were both pretty troubled as a result. "

"1. Make sure you are using protection and perhaps consider abstaining from sex while you're working this out with her.
2. Find a baby or a toddler from a friend or family member and sign up to babysit for an entire day. Like all day long. Give your wife that experience to help her realize how much work is involved and how life-altering it will be.
3. Make a list of life experiences that you want to have before having kids. ""30"" is so arbitrary. It's more powerful to say ""I want to have traveled here, I want to be at this point in my career, I want to have done X, Y and Z first."" to give her some concrete goals to focus on.

"&gt; The fact that I stop eating at exactly 7pm is what bothers my husband the most. He says it's too restrictive, based on no medical evidence, and it seems miserable to see me so obviously craving ice cream or pasta or potato chips at like 9pm while watching TV together, and restraining myself just because of this ""rule."" Sometimes I go to bed early, just because I get really hungry and it's past 7.

This paragraph really jumps out at me. But... I'm still not sure what to say about it, except that I empathize with your husband? I mean, if your reason for not eating after 7 was almost anything else I can think of, I would say you should stop depriving yourself and eat something. It sounds like your husband can tell that following your rule is making you feel really uncomfortable and unpleasant and he doesn't want you to put yourself through that. But if your reason is that eating will make you feel even worse, then I certainly can't tell you differently.

I guess just really ask yourself if not allowing yourself to eat anything after seven even when you're really hungry is really the optimum solution for your overall happiness, even if it sucks. And it certainly might be. I mean, if you had a severe food allergy to a food you loved, then not allowing yourself to eat it would still be the best solution even though it sucks. Anyway, so if you're sure it really is the best thing for you, be clear about that to your husband, that you're not just depriving yourself for no good reason because you feel like you have to follow this ""rule"".

After weeks of trying to get him to talk about it, I wrote him a letter that basically said ""look, I understand if this is hard for you. It's hard for me too. I can't make you care, and you don't have to be excited, but you have to HELP me."" I think that sort of put it into perspective for him that he was essentially allowed to have his feelings and uncertainties, but he couldn't neglect me (and future baby) because of them. I would try something like that, validating his feelings but making it clear that his actions are hurting you. 

And if it helps, he got way better once the baby was here and it was less scary than he imagined. It's a total 180, and he's a doting husband and father. He knows I have a lot of resentment about how he behaved when I was pregnant, but we've mostly worked through it. "

"If your friend continues to do this despite every effort of you and your friends, then she clearly has no regard for anyone's life. Next time she does, call the police. Even if you only catch her after the fact, the police can/might still press DUI charges. And having an interlock or jail or community service might be the slap in the face that smartens her up. 

And if she finds out it was you who phoned the cops, so what? Do you want your friend alive and pissed at you, or dead (along with an innocent bystanding family of 5) and not ""ruffled""?

Edit: what does the bartenders at this local place say on the matter? In most places, wait staff have an obligation to cut off people and/or take their keys and/or provide cab rides home - if they fail to make precautions, they could be prosecuted or fined as well.

What are you looking for here?  Magic words that will get your narcissistic father to change a lifetime of bullying and disregard for you?  

You can't change other people.  You can only control yourself.  So your options here are to change your reaction to your parents - ie. don't let their bullying and disrespect bother you and take your chances that they won't eventually turn their negativity on your child or that your child won't learn their behaviours.  

Or you can draw a boundary and then stick to it.  In this case, far away from them - withdraw yourself and your child from their toxicity.  

Which seems to be the only sane solution.  You said it yourself: ""Your time is over, old man, and you can either get with the program or gtfo.""  But then you hit the comments here and start vacillating.   Do what's best for yourself and your child and follow your own advice.  "
"Oh my god, what a clusterfuck. Your boyfriend is controlling, has backwards ideas about sexuality, and also has a poor understanding of anatomy. Why are you even with this fool?

""That is not the case and I really just think he's being unreasonable and I don't feel something like that is worth breaking up over.""

Yes, it is definitely worth breaking up over. Not because you are going to die if you can't use sex toys. It's worth breaking up over because he's displaying controlling tendencies that suggest he may be a dangerous person to be with. It starts with this sort of manipulative nonsense, but often progresses to violence. Immediately dump anyone who feels they have a right to control you like this. What the actual fuck."

"&gt; What kind of woman destroys their family rather than simply smile and say “yes, please” when their spouse sends the children to his mother, cooks dinner, does the dishes, and after a long massage, asks to penetrate her gently in whatever way she prefers until she orgasms, the first night in their brand new house?

The kind that was horribly abused early in her relationship. 

This is a completely normal reaction for people in relationships that were previously abusive. Please seek individual counseling and *be honest* about what you went through with your husband. You need to sort out whether or not you even *want* this relationship to fully recover from his abuse, or if it has irreparably damaged your trust in him, and therefore your marriage. I would not blame you either way. There is no right choice here. You never should have been treated the way he treated you, and since it cannot be undone, you only have to decide how you want to move forward in the way that's healthiest for you and your children."
"I'm a STEM PhD student and he's being an idiot. If he ever wants to get any funding he needs to be able to explain his work to laypeople. Sure he can't get into technical details but he should be able to explain the overall point of what he's doing to anyone. If he can't he doesn't understand it well enough. 

I get wanting to explain things you're frustrated about to someone that doesn't know the field, if that's what he wishes he could do with you tell him to simplify the specifics. When I complain about my coworkers to my mom it's normally along the lines of ""So I explained the experiment to coworker and he said he understood it, but then when he did it he looked for protein a instead of protein b! I thought that after my half hour explanation he knew that he needed to do a different kind of experiment to look at protein a, I'm so annoyed because it feels like he doesn't listen to my explanations"". The overall problem (coworker doesn't listen to me even though I'm right) is something anyone could understand.

Also if he actually thinks your work is useless (can't tell if you're projecting or if that's something he's actually said) you should either put him in his place or leave. You're getting your PhD in something because presumably it's important to you. If he doesn't value that and/or he doesn't see the light after you explain to him that what you do has value and that he should ask you about your work at the very least because he cares about you then you probably aren't a good fit."

"What was the inspiration for the blanket part of the ceremony? Are your mothers into quilting or embroidery?

I think you're fine for a few reasons:

1. You can explain the back story independent of any native american influence.

2. The blanket itself isn't mimicking any native design and is completely personal to your two families and unique.

3. Even if the ceremonial part of this is seen as appropriating, it's  symbol of love in a serious context, and not done in any mocking or light sense. Like, this is a completely different situation than some white dude wearing a full headdress to a Redskins football game.

And so on - obviously, as he had literally no fault in any of this mess, she will be forced to sputter out nonsense, in which case you ask her to clarify, explain. What did *he* do. What did he *do*?

Yes.

&gt;but who allows their kid to become like this?

Apparently you do. This was consensual, based on what your daughter said. This is not an instance with an aggressor and a victim. 

Sexual experimentation is normal for 8 year olds. There's a reason we all understand what the phrase ""playing doctor"" means. What this incident means is that you need to have ""the talk"" with your daughter. Given how freaked out you are, you probably also need to do some reading on child development. Your daughter is at an age where same-gender play is common, as is masturbation. She needs to understand several things: exploring your own body is okay, it's okay to say no to things you don't want to do, sex is private and for adults, etc. "
"

So what if you sped up the process? Eventually, at least some of men she slept with would've slipped up or admitted it out of guilt.

"I think it makes sense to address the marriage issue only, particularly because you have such a sensible, understandable reason for not having invited him. You had an extremely small wedding, you simply couldn't include everyone, you were sorry not to have him there, thanks for the best wishes.

That said, although it sounds like you have naturally grown apart, I wonder if some of your expectations for friends are a bit high. It's not right to expect people to donate to your causes; donations are gifts, not the dues you pay for friendship. And I wouldn't be surprised if your friend had *no idea* you expected him to contact you for pride month or LGBT-related events. It sounds a bit like you resent him for being white, affluent, having children... none of which necessarily means he's been a bad friend to you."

You're obviously going to do what you want to do, but I need you to realize how much worse this situation keeps getting the more you say.  He is not a good person.  He does not care about you.  He is selfish, and even if you don't see it or agree with it, you deserve so much better."
He has no need to change because his gf still dates him even though he's a dumbass.
"Youre fun to be with, so he wants to be with you. But, he knows youre not someone hes going to marry or even be with in a year or few. Youre basically exclusive friends with benefits. If you dont like his stance, youre well within your rights to break up with him."
"&gt; but I still love her and don't know whether to hold out hope she'll change her mind or just end it.

If you stay with her, it is because you love her enough to be with her, WITHOUT children.

If you can't do that, break up with her and move on."
"So I would start by talking to your sister about how her gf doesn't seem to be your biggest fan, and ask if she's noticed/if there's anything you've done without realizing. She may legitimately be oblivious to the issue, and it should be on her to figure it out.

That being said, one thing that stood out to me is I wonder whether sis and her gf are getting enough one-on-one time without you around. If you live together, and a lot of the time her gf spends with her is *also* spent with you... well, I'd be pretty resentful too, if I were her. It's nothing to do with jealousy, but your sister should be making an effort to spend quality date time with her gf - and that means no siblings allowed."
"My husband and I got pregnant too early in our relationship (like, 5 months in) and we chose a family to place the baby with for adoption. For a while afterward, I did resent him. I also resented myself for not being stable enough to take care of a baby. 

But it got better with time and with open communication. Now that we're closer to being ready for children, it is opening up some old wounds... but being able to talk about it helps so much.

You can't convince him you won't be upset and resentful afterward, because you can't read the future. What you CAN do is admit that it will probably be difficult for a bit and commit to helping each other through it. Counseling is also a great tool to utilize."
"I see four serious issues here:

-She's willing to have you *give up everything* and put yourself into a *poor standard of living* so she can go out and chase her dreams while you stay home and stagnate?

Uh.... no. You made a mistake by marrying this chick. You're clearly at the bottom of her list of priorities, and it's clear she views you as a doormat. In fact, her level of selfishness here is awe-inspiring. I couldn't *conceive* of putting anyone I purport to love in that kind of situation.

Dude. Imagine what she'd be like if you had kids together. Or if your disease progressed. Or hell, almost anything else serious. If you stay married to her, you're effectively still gonna be alone, just with someone legally bound to you and living under your roof and using your resources."

&gt; I'm not more focused on the money, but it hurts that my mom held me responsible for not cutting off my father like my sisters.

I think this is where you're not getting it. Who knows if your mother actually wanted you to cut off your father unless she explicitly said it. But, did you support her? Really talk to her? Take care of her? Spend time with her doing the things she enjoys? 

You say you thought you were close with her. What made you think that?  "
"OP, when I saw your post, my heart stopped for a few moments and I really sat and thought long and hard as to whether I would comment. At the end of the day though, I think my experience can benefit you, so here I am. The fact that he didn't mention his daughter is a red flag, but given that he was 14 when she was born and it was a tough situation, I can almost understand how he might have compartmentalized everything that has to do with her. He is also likely still seeing the situation with the eyes of a 14-year-old. But I don't really want to focus on him, I want to focus on you. 

A little less than a year ago, I was one of those people posting about a situation very similar to yours on a throwaway. Maybe you read my story. Basically, my husband had been contacted by a one-night stand on Facebook in order to tell him that he had a son. The one-night stand happened a month or two before we started dating. When we found out, I had been married to my husband for a little over three years.

Normally when someone is in a marriage-like relationship, it's important to make all major decisions together as a couple; however, this situation is incredibly personal and nobody, even your partner, can tell you how to feel, react, or what your boundaries are.
 
Before you talk to him, knowing what you already know, you need to decide what you will and will not accept. The future you imagined is gone, and as much as you love him, this will change things. There are a lot of unknowns that can happen, such as the custodial grandparents passing away, a major health issue, or even just the normal stuff like college expenses. Your lifestyle will be different, especially from a financial perspective (ie child support - if he hasn't been paying, count on him eventually being sued for back payments). 

If one day your boyfriend says that his daughter needs to come live with you both, will you be ok with that? What about if she starts coming over every second weekend? If he wants to have a closer relationship with his daughter, will you be ok with having a role in her life?  What about if your role is as a mother-figure? (I know it's unlikely as she is 12, but you never know). There is no wrong answer here, but you need to do some hardcore self-reflection to see what your boundaries are. The worst thing will be for you to say you're fine with things, and then realize in a few years when the situation changes that you actually weren't. Also, don't fall for the sunk-cost fallacy. Just because you moved to be with him doesn't mean you have to stay with him, But also, just because you found out about him having a daughter doesn't mean you have to break up with him. At the end of the day, and I can't stress this enough, **you need to figure out what you can and cannot tolerate independent of your boyfriend.**  This will be hard and take some time. I would recommend going away for awhile (a few days, weekend or however long you can manage )to reflect if you can.

The next thing you do is talk to him. Not in a sneaky way. You are both adults, and this is a serious situation. You just be upfront and say that his grandmother told you about his daughter. Ask him questions so you can understand his perspective. Things like how he feels about his current relationship with his daughter, what he imagines the future to look like, financial obligations toward his daughter, basically all the things you asked yourself first. The point of the conversation is to hear his thoughts, plans, and expectations towards himself, you and his daughter. At this point, I wouldn't really comment too much, just listen. Be supportive as this will be hard on him. At the same time, be mindful that he may be saying what he thinks you want to hear, as he may be scared of losing you. How to proceed is also something he needs to come to on his own. It will make things worse if he agrees to her moving in when his heart is not into it because that's what you say you want. Whatever you both decide to do, you both need to 100% be ok with it. It's ok if you both talk about this a lot. It won't just be one conversation. 

Eventually, open up about your thoughts as well. You may find that the way you both envision the future, or how you deal with certain situations, is compatible. Which is great. You may find that it's not. And that's ok too. It's just important to both be honest with each other, and with yourselves. You'll eventually figure out what is right.

Although this is extremely personal, I'll share my different reactions. I'm not proud of a lot of them, they were pretty selfish and driven by emotion. Throughout the entire process, I tried to be very supportive, as whatever I was feeling was even worse for him, but it was hard. I tried my best to shield him from my feelings, as they weren't fair, but I wasn't always successful.

I reacted very strongly when I found out. At first, I was in denial. I did not believe that anything would change, and I really thought this was not a big deal. I couldn't understand why my best friend was freaking out for me. I couldn't understand why my sister kept telling me it was ok if I wanted to leave my husband since this was not the life I imagined for myself. After, once things started becoming real (DNA tests, interacting with Sarah, meeting Austin) I was angry. I was angry at Chris putting me in this situation and not using a condom. I was angry at the way he was reacting (burying his head in the sand and pretending this situation didn't happen). I was angry at Austin for existing, and I was most angry at Sarah for hiding his existence for five years and pretending another guy was the father. I felt that I would not have gotten into a relationship with Chris if I had known about his son, as I was childfree. Or maybe we would have still gotten together but would have stayed in Northern Ontario. If Chris would have known right away, he would have had a relationship with his son right from the beginning. He would have been present at his birth. That was stolen from him. My point is, our lives would have been very different if we had known right away. I guarantee you I wouldn't be in Montreal, working in IT, away from Chris' family. I skipped the bargaining stage and went right to depression. And anxiety. I was having panic attacks as to what I thought the future was going to be. When Chris had to go through the family court system, I thought I was going to lose my mind since I couldn't picture how things were going to play out. I was anxious about all the money we were spending. Over something that was not my fault. I was anxious about inheriting a five year old I knew nothing about. I was worried if that were to happen, how he would possibly be integrated into our lives, since essentially he was going to be ripped out of the only home he ever knew to a city far away where he knew nobody. It took me awhile to finally be OK, and even longer for us to be OK as a couple. Finally, after individual and couple's therapy though, we made it out on the other side and were stronger for it.

The other stuff is definitely over the top but why are you so worried about someone else's eating habits? You can try to have a non-accusatory conversation just calmly asking if he'll try new foods sometimes and try and minimize waste.
