"Oh, and ditch the freeloading boyfriend. When you are lucky enough to have a 90k/year job you do not just quit so you can loaf around on someone else's dime. He quits and loses his savings, or he quits and finds another chick to pay his way. Don't be dumb OP, you've worked too hard to get what you have plus your siblings need you because your parents are worthless. "
"You are in denial about this relationship.  It is inappropriately close.  Find another running mate and stop with the ""hanging out"" at work.  "
"Breastfeeding is better for the baby than formula - there is an actual reason to keep doing it as opposed to switching. Every doctor I've talked to has said that the new ""standard suggestion"" is to breastfeed for at *least* the first year, due to the benefits. Being a midwife I""m sure you already know this - just wanted to emphasize that what you're doing is better for the baby. (important note: not trying to knock women who have difficulties or cannot breastfeed - you aren't harming your baby and there is no shame there.)

It was a bit awkward for me when I had my firstborn, but mostly only from feeding in public. I had been accustomed to the norm of covering up and whatnot, but I quickly overcame that and realized that there is no shame in feeding wherever you are. The baby needs to eat and as long as you aren't actually trying to show off (for some weird reason) you shouldn't even need to cover up. Babies are usually pretty discrete and often people wouldn't even notice in public.

So overall, your husband needs to lay off. You guys are a team, and he has to respect your ways of growing your child and you both need to work together. Some decisions on how to grow the child can be at your discretion, however in terms of breastfeeding that is actually something that is better for your baby. There is a reason they say *at* ***least*** *a year*. 

The best way to do this is talk with him, maybe schedule a sit-down with you, him, and a doctor to talk about breastfeeding benefits, if it's more of a emotional or ideological reason maybe schedule a meeting with a therapist. Good luck!"
"This gift has way, way too many strings attached. Op, you have no idea how your mom could expect your behavior to change while she is still alive.

If you say yes, you are basically saying, ""Hi Mom, you can manipulate me with your money!"""

"And the thing is, when one *chooses* to have five children, as an adult it's then your responsibility to work to support them in their
 childhood. However, your parents groomed you to be a defacto parent. You are not a parent. Your mum needs to step up, and get a job. I fear once your father passes, you'll be the permenant sole breadwinner.
Oh, and dump your loser boyfriend unless he fills you with joy.  "
"The problem isn’t that he doesn’t understand, it’s that he doesn’t care. "

"To be fair, texting vs calling is more of a personality thing rather than a dating stages thing. Ask her if she prefers calling since you prefer calling to texting. If you've already been on 5 or 6 dates, you are likely at the ""calling stage"" if one exists."
"She can pump and let him do some feedings. If he’s just feeling left out, I would be a lot more understanding. If this is about him viewing breasts as sexual and he’s bothered by the concept of breast feeding, he needs to grow up. I think the reason he wants her to change is key. She needs to do more digging and find out what’s going on. "
"exactly, i could aboslutely not have children with someone like this. 

essential oils can be useful for mild cold symptoms and allergies ( i have a diffuser with eucalyptus oil for when i have a stuffed up nose and its great). chiropractor is totally fine for back or leg pain and imo better option than being on addictive pain meds. 

however the being an anti vaxxer and a whole family of people who dont get vaccinated sounds like a huge health risk to potential children. navigating those waters once the child is born will be a nightmare. you would not want the child to even meet any of these people until they are 2 to 3 yrs of age and had all of their vaccines because you would be putting their life at risk to do so. would your gf be okay with that? plus if your child has a health problem preventing them from getting certain vaccines they could really never meet that side of the family without putting their life at risk. 

and like you said in the op, what if the child is vaccinated and develops a health problem anyway? then in her eyes it will be the vaccines fault and you would be resented forever.

now if you truly plan on never having children it would only be your own health you would be risking. but then again what about the wedding? i would feel the need to warn my whole family that there would be unvaccinated individuals present. someone in your family could be exposed to a deadly illness. so maybe just elope?  

if you really care for this woman, there will be a way to figure all this mess out. but it will be many long and difficult dicussions. good luck op."
"What you are describing sounds like she's potentially emotionally abusive. She'd need to recognize her fault and commit to serious therapy, and you'd also need couple's counseling. You may need an individual therapist yourself. Do you think she'd be willing to do that? Did she recognize the problems in your marriage or recognize any fault on her part?"
How long did you know each other before getting married? Finances should have been discussed before hand. You should try to see a couples counselor and figure out how to set up Financials together
Are you willing to take that chance over a tattoo?  Come on man don't be daft
"I think you are waaaaay overthinking this whole situation. Do you suffer from anxiety? I’m only asking because I have a few friends with anxiety issues, and your post reminded me a bit of some of my conversations with them when they’re worried about something or having a problem. 

Anyway, when starting a new relationship, there’s always going to be a period of adjustment. For example, I was single for 2-3 years before I met my boyfriend, and I was part of a large and very active friend group and social circle. I naturally had to cut back on the amount of time spent with my friends, because I wanted to save most of my free time to spend with my boyfriend. I could no longer go out with my friends multiple nights per week, or spend all day with them on a Saturday during the summer, for example. And that was ok with me, my friends and my boyfriend. I found a compromise that worked for me and my boyfriend, as one needs to do in order to make a relationship work.

Your boyfriend, as you said, has been single for a while. It looks like this other couple has sort of adopted him, for whatever reason, and together the three of them have an established dynamic and routine. His friend’s wife has taken on the role of “social coordinator” for their little group, and is likely just continuing to do/act how she always has, because no one (specifically your boyfriend) has indicated to her that things need to change now that he’s in a relationship. And he hasn’t done that because for 7 months, you’ve been holding in your feelings and outwardly acting like everything is ok and that you’re fine with the status quo. 

Ideally, should he have automatically taken some of the time he spends with them and spent it with you, one on one? Yeah, probably. But if he’s been single for a while, and/or doesn’t have a lot of relationship experience, and has been dependent on this couple for a long time with regards to social life/activities and friendship, he may not know how to pull away from them a bit, or even that he should.  As others have said, just mention to your boyfriend that you’d like more one on one time with him. This doesn’t have to be some serious, emotionally charged discussion. Simply say something like, “I’ve enjoyed getting to know Ken and Barbie, but I’d love to have more time alone with you, where we can do things just as a couple, get to know each other better and build on this great foundation and connection that we have.”  

You said that you’ve already dipped your toes into the water on this front, and your boyfriend was receptive and responded positively to your request, so all signs point to him being receptive to more frequent and perhaps scheduled (like a weekly date night) “Pazu &amp; boyfriend alone time”.  If he’s resistant or gets upset at this very reasonable request, then you’ll have to decide if this is the right relationship for you. But nothing you’ve written indicates that will be the case. 

Given how you’ve described this woman, it’s also possible that your boyfriend wants more one on one time with you, but doesn’t know how to distance himself a bit from his friends or feels guilty about saying “no” to her or declining her invitations and plans. He might be a people pleaser or just not a very assertive person, so he might welcome you giving him a very valid and understandable reason to not spend every free moment with this couple. But you won’t know how he’s feeling unless you *talk to him*, just like right now he doesn’t know how you’re feeling. You’re needlessly causing yourself a lot of frustration and stress because you’re making a lot of assumptions about everyone’s desires and behaviors, when a simple conversation with your boyfriend could clear everything up and put your mind at ease.

You said somewhere (IIRC) that you’re trying to find your place and role in this group. However, this group might not work as a foursome. That’s ok! This is what happens as people get older and start breaking off into couples. It doesn’t mean that your boyfriend can’t be friends with this couple. It just means that if he’s serious about this relationship and wants to have a future with you, he’s going to have to put his relationship with you over his relationship with this couple. That’s also ok! You’re not going to like or mesh well with every person you meet, as is the case with this woman, but I bet if you start getting more alone time with your boyfriend and see less of this couple, her behavior and personality won’t bother you as much and spending time with her will be a lot more tolerable.

Lastly, do not talk to this woman directly about this issue, *especially* if you haven’t spoken to your boyfriend about it. Your boyfriend has to be the one to make time for this relationship and communicate his needs to and set boundaries with his friends. Going over his head and confronting this woman about her behavior would be disrespectful to your boyfriend and a violation of his boundaries and agency as an individual. This is a problem within your relationship, and it’s a issue that your boyfriend needs to take the reins in solving (once you tell him that there is an issue, of course), because they’re *his* friends and *his* relationship with them that needs to be adjusted, not your relationship with them. A third party, in this case his friend’s wife, cannot solve the problems within your relationship, to which she’s not even a party, and if you approach her in an attempt to resolve this issue, it would likely make things worse and make you look controlling. 

I know you were purposely being vague in this post, for the sake of anonymity, so I could be completely off base. But that’s my take on it given the information you’ve provided. 

Tl;dr: TALK TO YOUR BOYFRIEND!!! Good luck!"
"Jesus Christ.

You realize, if your parents and your boyfriend pulled their own weight, with your income potential, you could invest and eventually build real wealth? 

If your Dad stuck it out and supported his family until retirement, *like a parent*, you could go on a ten year investment spree and eventually retire young with self-sustaining income. 

What he and your mother are doing is *wasting your youth and best earning years* just to make their lives a little easier in the short term. At this rate, they're getting less and less hirable by the year, while you're unable to take advantage of work and investment opportunities because of the ongoing drain. 

Your boyfriend is right - it is moronic for your family, as a whole, to lean on you as their primary source of income. Imagine a two engine jet. Just because one is working great doesn't mean it's OK to keep flying with one broken. 

Also, he's likely not abnormally spendy. You are likely abnormally frugal, since your disposable income is all being diverted to necessities for your parents and siblings. 

That said, just being right doesn't make him right for you. It strikes me as lazy and also moronic for two young people with good incomes to *not* work hard to support each other. If he really wants to quit and leach off you, that's a red flag and I suggest you let him go. You'll be happier with someone whose work ethic matches your own. "
My guess? None of it lmao
"You're never obliged to give anyone a second chance. But you did. And she threw it away as carelessly and thoughtlessly as the first time.

It sounds like she already had planned her excuse for why she didn't cease the inappropriate behavior. She was going to let this go on as long and far as you didn't catch her, but when you did, she figured she had her ""get out of jail free"" card and things would be hunky-dory again. So when you questioned her, she gave you her premeditated response, figuring that would be good enough and all would be forgiven given some time. That's pretty vomit-worthy. 

Ditch this girl before she gives you some other man's STD. If she respected you, she would not treat you this way. Check out loveisrespect.org"
"i just want to chime in here, b/c i can totally relate to your experience.

i think it’s an illusion to think you did something wrong by not standing up for yourself. in my experience, standing up for myself in the kind of situation you were in doesn’t result in some sort of hollywood happy ending ... usually the “bully” is unfazed by my assertive reply (doesn’t hear me at all in the way i want to be heard), and in some cases if the bully is crazy enough, me being assertive will ramp up their anger and make them act inappropriately in an even more extreme way (i.e., start shouting at me).

when someone is a full grown adult and still acts like a “mean girl,” that means (in my opinion) that their “mean girl” personality is locked in, and there’s nothing you can do to change or “defeat” them, unless you want to become a mean girl yourself.

i don’t think you went wrong by declining to fight back against your colleague. i think you went wrong by inferring that this colleague’s behavior reflects on your personality somehow. this colleague has nothing to do with you or your identity. i agree that you should ignore her. if she ever does something that crosses a line (violates HR policy), then simply report her, without any drama. treat her like bad weather. bring an umbrella to work, but don’t yell at the clouds or expect them to understand you."

"I agree. And just because he moved across the country doesn’t mean they weren’t sending nudes and having a sexual relationship via FaceTime or Skype. There is no way he moved and they quit talking and shut their sexual relationship down on the spot. 

Also, I would not be able to get over the lying but also the fact he had to deal with all the emotional shit a bf deals with while the other guy got to sit back, relax, not deal with her emotional baggage, didn’t take her on dates, spend money, and got to bang her whenever he wanted. 

When it comes to the wedding and how expensive it has been, I would contact her parents to set up a conversation whether in person or on the phone. I would tell them how thankful you are for all they’ve done and how bad you feel. I would then explain that you’ve just had new relationship ending details revealed to you that have ended the relationship and if they have any further questions about what happened I would refer them to their daughter for answers. I would not give them details. 

Lastly, you can’t postpone the wedding/cancel it and stay together. Hundreds of people that you’re closest to are going to end up knowing one person cheated on the other. There is no other reason a wedding gets postponed when it is a month away. Your fiancé will never forgive you for postponing it. Your family will also resent her for cheating on you and putting you in this situation. 

Good luck man. You know you can’t marry this girl. It’ll take some time to come to terms with but I guarantee that in 5 years you will look back and realize not going through with the marriage was the best decision of your life."
"Well if you truly “don’t want to cause any unnecessary conflict or come off as controlling”  you won’t mention it, because it’s none of your business how she eats. Just don’t be in the room while she is eating. Problem solved.

But the fact that she is locked in to the point that she can't leave her job except by retiring just makes it even more shocking to me that you didn't think about that before fucking her boss. Honestly it almost seems like you calculated what you could do to hurt and trap your wife the MOST, and then did it.  

I think Cathy should leave and retire from this industry and do a different job, personally. Maybe you two should move? What industry is it? "
"Stop making excuses. If political discourse is damaging your relationship with her you need to stop engaging in it. There are plenty of things in the world to talk about. TV shows, interests, activities, vacations, work. Find other topics."

"&gt;I have my answer but don't have the heart to give it to her because I want to spend the summer with her and we have some trips planned that I don't want to be ruined due to my decision.

That is so selfish of you. You've been together three years, at least respect her enough to be honest. Trying to put it off so you can enjoy your summer is completely unfair to her. Maybe she'd prefer to spend her summer moving on if you're not going to be together come next school year. Maybe she doesn't want to start college fresh off a break up. Respect her enough to give her the truth. "
That sounds very doable. Thanks!
"Oh please.

And yet, he absolutely knew he was being an ass with those comments about her father. And he absolutely knew he was treating her wrong by kicking her out before she was even woken up, and then abandoning her in a foreign country...

OP reacted normally to abnormal behavior from him. If he didn't understand how or why what he did was wrong...that is NOT OP's fault. She wasn't asking him to be a mind-reader. He was manipulating her and emotionally abusing her. She doesn't have to communicate every minute detail of her feelings for him to understand she was hurt by his actions. He chose to act like a jerk. He knew exactly what he was doing.

OP, you did good. You were lucky that no one else took advantage of you in that situation! You know what he is like now...please break it off for your own mental health! Can you imagine how this would have felt if you had been pregnant or had children?! (No, she should not drink while pregnant...but her drinking was not the problem here.)"
"Does your current guy know he has no feelings for you? If a girl i recently started seeing had her ex give her a car i would be a bit taken back, a car is a big expensive gift, its even a chunk out of $600k. 

In most relationships an ex giving your current SO a gift is usually a sign he still likes her (not saying this is the case at all), and them accepting is usually a sign that they are interested in the ex. 

Try looking at this from his perspective- an ex you are still on good terms with is spending a large sum of money on a brand new car for you so suddenly, something he probably won't be able to gift you as easily as ex has.

Just keep in mind he has only been with you for 2 months, and this can be seen as baggage he may not want to deal with. 

I will not tell you whether you should accept this gift or not, its up to you which is more valuable. 

Another thought is that it has only been one day, so hopefully he is just busy and is fine with it. "

"This is what ruins otherwise great relationships. You two have built something wonderful and you love her. Why throw it away for randos and one night stands?

Once you have found the one, the single life isn't all its cracked up to be.

If she agrees to this, that means she may meet someone else and fall in love and decide to marry them instead. You want her to stick around while you experiment and just wait for you to come back? Not gonna happen."
"Tell her the truth.  It’s cruel to use her for sex for the summer, which is really what your plan is."

"I think people place too much value on waiting to have sex before in a relationship. If you like this person, and WANT to have sex with them, you should! Not saying you should have sex immediately, but if it feels right to for it. I would tell this person you're a virgin, as well as any expectations you might have (do you want a relationship? Keep it casual? Just go with the flow?) Sex changes relationship dynamics and can elicit strong feelings for someone after sex. If you're not ready, then don't. "

"OP do you have anxiety about other things in your life? It sounds like you’re overly anxious about the pregnancy and it’s manifesting in controlling behavior. Like, really really controlling. 

None of the activities you mentioned should be a problem. 

It’s unfair to expect her to cater to your irrational concerns. It’s not her job to manage YOUR anxiety. Ask her if she would be OK with you talking to the doctor about the stuff your wife’s doing, and trust what he or she tells you. And see a therapist on your own if you continue feeling compelled to treat your spouse like this."

If you truly like/love someone, then exs/other people don't even come on to your radar. From what you've described, it sounds like there's still a thing with the ex, and the fact she's been non-committal (not telling her friends about you, etc) smells to me like this is a ""holding"" relationship for her.

Sounds like you really like this woman, but in the long run this will be a very unhealthy relationship for you where you'll never fully trust her, and she may end up leaving you and hurting you anyway.

Trust is everything, and for you it isn't there."

You have no children, (i'm assuming) no joint businesses. It's been 2 years, your joint assets can easily be separated. This man will not change. His mother will not change. This life is not for you. Get out. "
That is an outright lie. You listed several instances of abuse that you committed in this post alone. You will never have a relationship with your kids until you own your actions for what they were.
He’s cheating on you
"OP, does your mom *know* this is an intentional no-contact decision from Charlie? Charlie made this decision sometime close after her 21st bday, so relatively recently, and basically slow-ghosted mom until no contact was reached. From what you wrote, your mom's made comments that imply she sees this behavior like a lack of caring more than anything else. 

Is she trying to confront what she thinks is uncaring behavior from a daughter who can't be bothered to stay in touch, or does she know there's an intentional hard boundary?

Warn Charlie in any case. But if the former... someone needs to clue her in. "
"""THEY"" dont know how to resolve conflicts. 

I've yet to see you take any real responsibility for either your parenting or your relationship with your wife. 

And 3 of those ""they"" were/are children. It is not their responsibility to fix any of this. It's yours. If you wish it to be so. 

Like another poster, I suggest you seek counseling. Once you are able to reflect on your part of the issues here, you'll be better able to repair your relationships. But that won't happen until you recognize your part. "
I really hope you don't take this person's thoughts seriously. You made it sound like you have a wonderful relationship. We only know this one small incident that you have shared with us. Your story makes it sound like he wasn't prepared to reveal your engagement plans so he made said some shitty fear of commitment cliches to shut it down. It seems like the only thing you need to know is why he's not ready to talk about it to his family. 
"Yeah what he’s done is over the line no question about it. You have expressed a very reasonable desire that your man not pay overtures to another woman. He has refused. It is time to escalate this: discuss breaking up, moving away (with him or without) or therapy. "
"I did that once. A bunch of friends were joining me for a trip to an island with a ferry going back and forth just a couple of times each day. I asked all my friends to be there 1/2 hr early, then I asked him to be there 2.5 hrs early. He surprisingly there in good time! Just 30 minutes late for the ferry 😑 "
"That's not how alimony is decided, and that's why there are courts who do it. Either way letting her being legally free of the man who cheated on her ought to be the minimum he owes her after ruining the rest of her life. 

Technically you are still the side piece, and you absolutely were when you both stepped out on your marriages. Anyways, what you've got is what you've got, I don't think he has any incentive to change his circumstances. "

"Yeah, this. I did this with an ex. It wasn't that he had no fashion sense in his head, he just felt, idk, wasteful? vain? wearing anything other than the t-shirts he'd gotten as swag at his jobs and the jeans that had holes but were technically still jeans. I just gradually bought him a shirt here, a shirt there, and he realized he liked the way he looked in well-fitting, non-holey, not-exclusively-black clothes. I've seen him a few times in recent years and he dresses better than I do now, haha.

Don't do the TV sitcom thing of throwing out the old stuff--that's just wrong IMO--just get him a few things you do like and compliment him when he wears them. He might throw out the old stuff on his own, or he might end up with a box of sentimental t-shirts stashed away somewhere, which is what my ex did."
"So sorry OP, but I think this is spot on."
"I literally had this happen with a guy friend of mine. I did not like him. I thought we could maybe get over it and still be friends since we’d been close for a while, and in my mind, since I had no romantic feelings for him, I assumed it could be mended. It could not. It had nothing to do with liking attention. We aren’t friends now. "
"The point is that you shouldn’t be worrying about the quality of man you will find. You should be worried about supporting your kids.

If you can’t do that without a man, you’ve got some way bigger issues. Pull up your grown up mommy pants and show your kids women in the 2019 are better for something than warming beds in exchange for monetary support. You called tinder for skanks but unless you’ve got something more to offer than your self professed “thin body”, it seems you’re pot calling the kettle black tbh. 


Get a job. Your kids must have friends - have their parents help with babysitting. Build a support network. Do something, anything, that shows your kids you have guts, ability, and can work hard like anyone else.

If your first solution when things go bad is to get a new guy, you are already failing your kids HARD in what you’re teaching them."
"You’ll be okay. Lots of people get crushes on their teachers, it’s not at all unusual, but they do go away. You’re almost done high school, and then you will have an easier time getting over it. Try not to worry. "
"Sorry to say but you don’t know this until you meet someone. I have a friend who would have said the same thing about her boyfriend a few months ago, but because it was an LDR, the jealousy and stress levels were really high, and he quickly became controlling. 

On the other hand, when you spend more time together in person, you’re opinion of him might also change. You don’t really get to see how he treats others, his habits, his mannerisms etc. in an LDR"
"What exactly did she say that was narrow-minded? She said she, herself, isn't a fan of porn and doesn't want it to be a part of her relationships. She didn't really put porn down in general or people who like it. You can have a personal preference and not be judgmental about other people's preferences. It's like having no problem with others being polyamrous but wanting not part of that lifestyle for yourself. Live and let live."
"Of course it’s your money. And you have every right to spend it as you see fit. That’s you decision, but the thing is that decisions have consequences. And a consequence of your decision to treat your daughter in this blatantly unfair manner and to use your money as a form of punishment and control may well be that your relationship with your daughter might be seriously damaged if not completely destroyed. You don’t owe her your money, but she doesn’t owe it to you, as an independant adult, to maintain a relationship with you or to allow you a role in her life and the lives of your future grandkids."
I’m honestly screaming lmao wtf 
"Why should he? He can shack up with his side piece and doesn't have to be responsible for splitting assets or alimony. Doesn't matter to him that she can't move on with her life, he gets his cake and to eat it too."
"Sounds like “it’s okay but when it comes to me needing support her needs come first and she’s too stubborn for that to change.”

Real talk: get someone who would be honored to take part in something you’re honored to be invited to.

Anything else is a dealbreaker, IMO."

"&gt; I feel like he wishes he could hook up with her again, and it's my preference for a monogamous marriage that keeps him from doing it. 

You are definitely reading way too much into what he said during a dream.  We can't control our dreams and sometimes, funky stuff happens.  It sucks that you heard him say that, but you also need to find a way to let it go.  You're insecurity is going to turn this into self\-fulfilling prophecy."
"Shit, I'm a visual artist and that's how it works.  Chronic dissatisfaction is how the real good shit happens."
"Not to be rude, but he sounds like a real cad. He left her, she’s got cancer and he’s letting her struggle financially and doesn’t even talk to her even though he was married to her for a long time. And he’s treating her like this why? Because he fell in love with you (while typing words into a computer)? 
You fell in love with him but are you treating your former husband this badly? "

"Okay. As a 'modern' Indian woman living in India... You're a crappy parent for one thing because you penalise your daughter for being her own person. And you don't hold the keys to what Indian culture is at all. You don't define it. You don't own it. You don't decide if people follow the rules of it. 

You realise that it isn't 'Indian culture' for a girl to have an education at all, right? If you care so much about kulchur why aren't you getting your younger daughter married to someone much older so she can stay at home and have babies. 

And I promise you your other children don't give a shit about your rules or your kulchur. But they realise that they have to suck it up and put up with your narcissism for a while. So they are going to play dutiful son and daughter for a while and probably show their true colours after they make use of your money. No doubt seeing the way Ramya is treated makes it clear you will only do for them to the degree you dance to their tune. 

I don't even think it's the money that bothers Ramya. It's how you treat her as a pet. Does she beg when you say beg? Give her a treat. She probably has great qualities and you merely dismiss them as 'western'. What are you doing living in the West, taking advantage of their culture?

If you give so much of a shit about culture, stay in India and live with that ceiling that keeps us where we are, in part at least. You know you wouldn't have earned nearly as much money here as you did in your western place. 
How nice for you that you used their culture of rewarding ability and hard work with substantial  financial reward and security. Tahts not very  Indian culturish. 

I hope Ramya gets over you and moves out and cuts contact. "
"&gt; I'm happy to be your friend, but I can't be your therapist.

this.  this!!  my friends, my husband...i'm always, always happy to listen to them but i have never hesitated in telling them when it's above my pay grade.  (ESPECIALLY with my husband; he floated that as an alternative and i couldn't nope out of that any harder.  i know therapy is an uncomfortable concept in theory and practice, my dude, but your issues are decades old and my role is not to fix them, it's to stand beside you and support you while *YOU do the work*.)

anyway.  perfect comment, best answer."
"Yea, people need to be more realistic about the term 'used', people use you for meals, people use you for money, people use you for sex, people use you for rides. No one 'uses' you for friendship. 

If she's doing any of the above cut her off and never look back. Otherwise get a hold of yourself, people who value your friendship won't just cut you off like that. "

"""Culture clash"" infuriates me. It's a bullshit excuse, because not even if it was part of the culture would his behaviour be excusable. I think the US has a lot of people trying to be accepting but in the wrong way."
"It is really important that you stand up for your boyfriend because this otherwise might impact his self esteem or sound to him like you agree with your sister and feeding into insecurities.

Just tell her ""I don't care about bf's height, why are you so obsessed?"" or any of the countless other ""calling her out"" things here."
There is quite a clear subtext to his complement though. It's not like she's imagining it.

"First of all, you should stop engaging in these conversations. You're treading in dangerous territory here. Just shut it down.

Second, have you told your wife that the issues in your sex life don't just make you feel unsatisfied, they also make you feel undesired? Her perspective could be that she does find you attractive and she does desire you, but once/week is where her libido is at. But yeah you should tell her how crushing it is for you to feel unwanted by her, and how hurtful it is to you that when you express a serious problem to her, she does nothing to change it. Sorry about all this OP. "
"If it makes you feel any better, I'm tearing up a little because I know that feeling so so well. The feeling of ""if I could just be what he wanted in the first place, he wouldn't say and do these things. I have to do better."" 

It's so easy to fall into that line of thinking. For better or for worse, I've always considered myself to be pretty cocky and self confident, but even that wasn't enough to keep me out of the same sort of self-defeating mental state that you're now in when I was with my ex. Your first big relationships tend to hit the strongest, because in the beginning it feels like you'll never find anything this great again. You don't notice when it starts to get bad, and when you do finally notice, all you can do is think of where you went wrong.  

But after you get out and can reflect on everything without worrying what the consequences to the relationship will be, you'll realize all the subtle ways he chipped away at your self esteem, and how you were in love enough to let it happen. The upside is that relationships like these make excellent learning opportunities, and you leave knowing exactly how you won't tolerate being treated again. It's a hard learning curve, learning how to get that part of your self esteem back. But it's SO absolutely worth it."

"This was a main problem in my marriage with my now ex-husband. I feel your pain, it’s horrible. You try to justify it and reflect on what you can do to make the situation better but you end up hitting a wall if they don’t see an issue with it. My ex ended up seeing a psychiatrist who specialized in sex/porn/love addiction. We had to pay out of pocket as our insurance wouldn’t cover it but it was worth it. This therapist was fantastic and I can say my ex genuinely put in the effort to fix this but in the end, the damage was done and will still divorced. He went from porn to webcams and to me that is akin to cheating because you *interact* with another person. 
Feel free to pm me if you’d like. "
"It sounds like your relationship with her has really increased your quality of life.  Your happiness is obviously very important to her, and I'm sure that not hurting you (again) is her top priority.  Plus she really has her life together and can only make things easier for you.  All your friends and family must love her, and I'm sure you'll be glad she's around if you should ever experience any kind of crisis or tragedy in life.

If you can't read the above paragraph without it sounding sarcastic, then this is not a good, healthy, *beneficial* relationship for you, and you should end it as soon as possible.  I know ending relationships is hard, and it's likely to make you unhappy for a while.  But staying longer isn't going to make it any easier.  This is a bad relationship, and bad relationships almost *never* get better - only worse.

You already know what you need to do."
"No. OP, don't show up with a passive aggressive card to her baby shower. Don't be petty at this woman's shower just because she didn't want to be rude and tell you upfront that she doesn't want your used baby stuff. Her putting it off for a month was her way of letting you know that she wasn't interested. Yes, she should have clearly communicated she didn't want the stuff, but she was more worried about hurting your feelings. And apparently, she was right because you did take it personally. "

"I understand what you’re saying but if it’s bothering her enough to ask Reddit for advice,  it’s going to bother her until she has an answer or explanation from this guy. With that being said, it also sounds like there are a few more topics that need to be addressed in regards to the entire relationship as well. 

Edit: Contradictions like “not official” and “boyfriend” make it confusing to read also"
"&gt;turning it around on me, saying I’ve put up with much worse by other guys and this is very small in comparison

NO. Just...NO. ""Other guys have been cruel to you so that means you should let me be cruel to you, too,"" is basically what he's saying. 

This guy is not worth your time. Neither he nor his friends, apparently, can see you as a person rather than your skin color and nationality. That's not going to bloom into a great relationship. Don't accept this behavior. It's one thing if his friend said something and he didn't realize it bothered you and was apologetic for not standing up for you or something. But he tried to blame YOU for not putting up with his crap. 

Just drop him now and find someone who sees you as a person and not a nationality. Anyone you need to argue into respecting you is just not worth your time and will never truly respect you.

"Marriage isn't decrees, but it also isn't completely ignoring your partner's concerns and feelings???"
"Taking sil at her word, that doesn’t entitle her to move in with OP and hubby. They can help her get set up somewhere but having her move in isn’t much of a solution."
"Were you clear about the terms? They had no reason to know the deposit was that much or that it would be nonrefundable unless you told them. 

And why would you cancel if half the people still wanted to go? If half of it is already sunk, let the other 2 pay their share and go! Or ask if the two who want to go would be willing to split it 4 ways. You could always try to recruit more friends in the meantime. And did you tell your friends $800 was non refundable before you cancelled? They’d probably rather pay more and get something than pay $100/person for nothing. Again, you need to be more clear in your communication."
Right?! I'm getting a distinct whiff of that. I wonder what her relationship with social media is like. Is **everything** a matter for public consumption? 
"I'm not saying I like or agree with their stance, just taking issue with the idea that OP's parents are horrible racists when all evidence points to them being completely fine with their son dating a Mexican girl until her illegal status was revealed. Some people are just extremely legalistic, and that is a problem in and of itself. Calling them racists misidentifies the problem and often complicates the search for a solution."
"You aren't being unreasonable, he is.  This woman occupies too much space in his emotional life.  As long as that's true, you know that he's not 100% committed to you and you can't really feel open to trust him completely.   That's a bad situation.  You can have an okay relationship but never a really great one.

You've been far too cool about this.   Confronting him will just evoke another round of justification on his part with no admission.  He will never agree to stop nurturing their emotional tie. 

For your own self-respect, you need to get out of this relationship.  Do not Justify, Argue, Defend or Explain.  Just tell him that it's not working out and move on."
"There is SO MUCH going on here.

"This person is wrong. Even when you get married, your current name is on the license. Nothing changes unless you do it yourself. I like how they assume it's only the woman's name who would change and not the man's, which we know sometimes men change to their wife's name."
"I mean, it's your house, I'd march straight in there when I heard that and shout ""OI! That is NOT how adults in a respectful relationship behave to each other. Harry you are allowed to leave if she continues that nonsense, Amy you do that again and I cannot TELL you how disappointed I will be in you.""

Brings it into the open, lets Harry knows he has options, will probably humiliate Amy and she'll be angry with you, but she's 16, when is she not. 

The worst thing you could do is enable her. "
"This is going to sound harsh, but ask your mom if she wants to have a relationship with you or your ex.  Your mom may think she's being kind, but really she's enabling your ex and giving her false hope.

I really suggest that you post on /r/justnomil.  You need to set boundaries and give your mom consequences.  She is an adult and can choose her friends, but she doesn't get to have a relationship with you while she's encouraging your unstable ex to keep coming around."

"You are 95% right in what you said but even though he knows how he looks it still hurts like a bitch to hear that.  Just don't lie about anything trying to make him feel better it will only make it worse if he finds out. Just tell him like you said you like him much better over all everybody's different in different ways. And we like what we like too can't help that. I mean maybe buddy is in better shape snd more well endowed but he's also an asshat getting naked at parties trying to show off, he's got his own set of issues. He'll get over it but it just stings right now keep reassuring him he'll be ok. Bigger guy myself so I kinda know."
"Good fucking riddance! Your sexual history (as long as you're STD free) is literally no one's fucking business. He obviously isn't okay with women ""doing whatever they want"" because he was willing to walk away from an almost year long relationship over your past and then result to belittling and insults ....and then ghosts you like a fucking child. 
What he meant by ""Women can do what they want"" is he wants to benefit but then thinks less of them.
In short, you're way better off. Have sex, have fun, be safe, move on to less childish men.

"I believe that you will, at one point, grieve for the lack of affection during your childhood. You and your father will not be able to go back in time to fix this. 

It's highly likely because he did not know how to take care of your emotional needs, but because you mention his consistent routine, he *is* trying to have a relationship with you and it's possible that he could do a little more for you but that would take a lot of time, effort and patience. 

I think you would benefit from looking at some reading materials in the r/raisedbynarcissists subreddit, the people there have also not received adequate affection from their parent(s)

EDIT: I never said that he's a narcissist, OP has been neglected and the raisedbynarcissists subreddit has good reading materials and support for that.

Oh my god that sounds like absolute hell... I’m so sorry for the loss of your hair from all that stress

Your boyfriend would be better off addressing his insecurities than running off to a friends house. I mean, your ex is trashy, so saying current bf has a better personality is like.... well its true.

"If someone really came here and said, “I’m moving across the country and marrying a woman I met a month ago, and her relatives ran a background check on me” not a single person would bat an eye, other than asking why in the world he’s marrying someone he barely knows.

Please contact her parents and the school. She won't thank you but this is definitely and eating issue. 
"Even if your friend has developed ""orthorexia"" or is using veganism to mask an eating disorder, there is not much you can do. Her issues are deeply rooted, whether she has body dysmorphia, self esteem issues, anxiety/depression, or if she is using food as a tool of control for comfort, or any other underlying mental health issue that is manifesting as an ED. The reasons for having an ED are many and she will need professional help. You cannot force her to get that. 


Just let her know ""hey, you don't look well lately and I am worried about you. I'm here if you ever need to talk. I won't judge you, you're my friend and I support/love you unconditionally."" Beyond that, as hard as it is, there's nothing you can do. She has to want to help herself."
I usually see at least one year as the benchmark. 
"So, when my sister and her ex broke up she put a lock on the garage, just the garage due to some bigger items in there that belonged completely to her. No other locks were changed. He could still access the garage and all his items in there were easily retrieve through the door to the house. And if she happened to be there she would be totally fine opening the garage while he was moving stuff out. But he was already holding some of her stuff for ransom, basically (like a vehicle in her name) so she didn't want him to easily move those things while she wasn't home. 

Here's the funny part. He lost his key to the house. And refused to ask for another one from the landlords. He wanted *her* to make one for him. Yeah, no, *she* doesn't have make him one so she didn't. So he couldn't access the house due to his own stubbornness.

He was also like many of the guys described on here. Manipulative and made my sister beg him to stay a bunch. He got flustered like OPs ex when my sister hit her limit and went cold. 

And frankly, I'm ready glad he was too stubborn to ask for a new key because he keeps pulling stunts like parking outside her house for hours while she was at work (no attempt to get in, just texts saying how lonely he was, cry on the driveway. Or a sudden ""why is your side gate open""). Showing up at her house drunk and telling her if she didn't let him in and he got in a crash that it'd be her fault. Took one of her old phones while moving, it was still linked to her Facebook account so he  read *everything* as far back as possible. Started texting her shit about things she had talked to my mom about two years ago. and asking why her and her friend said xyz about random situation not to do with him. Stuff like that. He's still doing it."
Uhh yea. That sounds nice. I donated 13 inches of my hair without telling anyone and my mom was very very upset. I also have kept it short since or at least let it grow out and donate it again. You think she would be okay since it’s to help kids who are self conscious about not having hair but no. She is still held up about it every time I have my hair cut or trimmed to keep short.
"He is not putting his parents out of his life over a girlfriend. They did this to themselves. OP hasn’t changed one thing; his parents started this. 

I can’t imagine doing something like this to my children. They are intentionally causing their child stress for their own selfish reasons. If OP chooses not to engage or expose himself to that it is a perfectly reasonable response. 

I will never understand this mentality that kids owe their parents their time when those same people are causing them harm. It is absurd and cruel. "
"Everyone always thinks the grass  is greener on the other side. Is it fun to sleep around?  Depends on who you ask and when you ask them. I thought it was at the time whenever I slept with someone new. But not so much when I was getting tested for stds.  Also condoms break so even if you're not intentionally being careless you always run the risk of an accident leading to a pregnant girl you really don't care about. Maybe it just costs you money, a ride to the clinic, and some guilty feelings or maybe you get to be a parent with a girl you barely know. At the end of the day everyone tells the good stories about how fun it is. No one tells the I got syphilis story or the I spent my rent money on an abortions story.   But even if you get lucky and nothing bad happens at some point you're going to most likely want to settle down. The perfect girl for that will most likely be the one you dumped to sleep with girls whose names you dont remember. And it's unlikely she'll be available to you. So you get to look for a new girl.  And remember, no girl wants to be lucky 47 on the list of people you slept with which makes finding someone more difficult. The real kicker is out of all those one night stands or girls you're just sleeping with, most of the time the sex will be rather mediocre.  You're not really going to know what each other likes and sometimes it'll be awkward for at least one of you.  You'll find sometimes that you would have better off just taking care of yourself instead of dealing with some new girl. 

Basically if you're happy with the girl you're with than be grateful. You're friends are sleeping around because no one girl has been able to make them happy. You might envy then now but at some point they'll most likely envy what you have. They might even envy you already. "
"""They were discussing inducing me early, which I relayed back to Jack""

So . . . Yeah. She told him. "
Plus those kids might learn from their mother to look down on their own grandparents for not being rich and anyone else who isn't rich. I doubt OP wants that for his parents or wants those prejudices instilled in his future children.

"&gt;I don't get the predatory bit?  

It's not 100% clear from the description, which is why I said *slightly* predatory. 

The OP wrote: 

&gt;&gt;He kept asking me if I wanted to go over to his place, check out the view or something but I was pretty firm in saying no. 

Asking a stranger once would be fine, in the context of a casual encounter. But in the OP's own words, he **kept bringing it up** after she had already said no. 

Combine that sort of insistence with the weirdness of wanting to bring someone you just met to your place against their clear preference -- ostensibly to ""show them the view"" -- well, I get negative vibes. That's all.   "
"Agreed! OP do not let her in your house, even for one night!!"
"Speaking of power imbalances, if he was the one who initiated their first kiss, he did it right after she was crying and vulnerable. I could see that being sweet in a sappy romantic movie kind of way but she even says ""I can't do that"" and he kisses her again? This is real life and not a movie. He acknowledged he bulldozed over a boundary and didn't care at all...."
"Yes— glad to know she has friends and sports— neither are likely to put up with temper tantrums. If she can control it sometimes, and sounds like she must be, that gives a lot of hope."
"I wouldn't do that to my son.  And I'm sorry that your dad thinks it's okay to do it to you.

It seems to me that it would be best to put your energy into creating a new life for you and your girlfriend that doesn't include your dad's cottage.  It may take a while, but it seems that in the long run you'll be better off.  "
"Change the wi-fi password until she pays what she owes. Keep TP in your room, etc. If she complains you're being ""mean"" or ""immature,"" tell her or anyone who mentions it that you've tried repeatedly communicating with her directly, and she straight-up ignores you, and this was the only thing that got her to even acknowledge you.

And obviously don't pay her portion of things ever again. You say it's ""easier that way,"" but it's NOT if one person consistently takes advantage of the system."
You definitely should talk to him. Sounds as if he isn’t quite over her and is getting a tattoo to remind himself of her. 
What else is going on in your life right now? Family stuff aside.
"&gt; I feel like going on maternity leave right after accepting a paid course from my work is a bit rude and unprofessional. But I know I am the sort of person to feel like I owe people more than what I really do.

Nope. It's not ""rude"" to take maternity leave, ever, under any circumstances. It is not unprofessional. There will always be something at work that is important and that maternity leave will affect. That's fine. You and your company/boss can figure it out, when necessary. You do not owe your boss a say in your personal decisions.

I want to say that again for emphasis: You do not owe your boss a say in your personal decisions."
"&gt; As long as you understand the risks and are willing to accept the liability

Well that's a BIG 'as long as'.  The real version of that is 'as long as we are willing to pay for her apartment for the rest of the year as well as any damage she does to it' then sure co-signing is a great option that will help her build credit.  

Based on the situation tho, IMHO they would be foolish to take on that much expense and liability.  "
"At 29, one should be working all the hours they can to be able to afford their own place. At 29, you should be hellbent on moving out from your parents.

This guy has no fire under his ass. He’s perfectly content to let Mommy and Daddy pay all his bills and cook and clean for him.

She’s not jealous. She’s bitter that he isn’t working towards a future with her, which is quite understandable."
"On one hand, if you think your fiance might cheat on you if the circumstances are right, that's a cause for concern regardless of the bachelor party setting. You should be able to say ""I know he will not cheat under any circumstances"" and it seems you can't. 

That being said, you aren't being treated respectfully here by your BIL or fiance. It is *excessively* personal to have found a particular porn star your fiance is into and have that person at a private party in a hotel room especially in light of the history with Brent. This escalates it beyond a typical strip show kind of setting and I understand why you aren't comfortable with it. You know your options - put your foot down and tell him this is over the line and they'll need to cancel the private performance, or let it go. It's unfortunate that they would abuse this situation to take the party so far, and it's especially unfortunate your fiance doesn't have the balls to tell Brent this is clearly not a good idea. My suggestion is to hold your ground. If you're ok with a guys' weekend away and a visit to a strip club, it does not strike me as particularly restrictive. "
"You have to take a step back and think, do you honestly think these type of people would be even a tenth as upset if a bunch of white Europeans stayed in America illegally? I live in a fairly racially... um... not good part of the country, and I honestly can't see people I know having any issue with that. But if it's ""Mexicans""? Get 'em out! These same people drop the n-word casually. Correlation, sure, but with a same root cause."
This needs to be up higher. Them saying they were drunk and didn't really know what was going on is really just a way to make themselves feel better in the long run about it. Having issues in the bedroom doesn't give someone the green light to end up cheating.
"Who would be cool with that? If my gf was like, ""lol won't tell my sister I don't want to hang out w a porn star bc too much trouble"" I would reconsider the relationship and how much she actually cared about me. Why can't he just leave the room and get a drink while the pornstar is there?"
"She might be, but he definitely isn't. :-/"
"I've been in this situation but I was the female friend. I'm single and my best friend, a male,  is also single.  There is absolutely no attraction between us. Every time he dates someone new, I come up because we talk almost night. It's time for you and this girl to talk and spend time together.  If she's a true friend of his, she'll want to put your mind at ease."
"Please stop trying to have a baby.  You and your husband do not currently have a healthy enough relationship to bring a baby into.  You two need to get back on birth control and work on yourselves FIRST.  Your communication style is not effective \(ie \- getting drunk and bringing up difficult subjects\), and I think you could really benefit from bringing a professional counsellor into this.  You're both SO young and I think you have some development to do."
"If possible, I would suggest looking for a new therapist who is not only knowledgeable but also relatable, personable, and helpful.

Your boyfriend's ultimatum was indeed extremely manipulative, a huge red flag.  At the very least he now has another thing to apologize for which is in some ways worse than the first thing."
"&gt; freedom phase

This phrase is the answer to all your questions about what's wrong with you, etc.  The freedom to get with other women is more desirable to you at the moment than escalating this relationship.  But maybe that's changing."
"If your wife is just exhuasted from pregnancy, that is one thing. The abuse is another. You said she has refused to work since basic training? How long ago was this?  I'm from a small town, and married a guy in the military. It is terrible, but a lot of folks marry guys in the military because it's a big social status thing in small town usa, and you can depend on them. Now, I didn't do that, and most people don't do that, but yeah, it totally happens. If you just got into training, she may not be working because she's pregnant, and doesn't want to get into a job hunt only to  leave a few months later. However, if you stay in a place for several years, yes, the spouse should look for work if the family needs it.

There are several good career options for military so's, and she can look into those if she needs some guidance. However, she has to *want* to work. You don't  need to sit in one place, spinning your wheels, trying to get  someone to work who has no intention of going back into the workforce. Now, I don't know if that's your wife, because I don't have eough info on the situation. Just be aware there are some people who you cannot get to hold down a job with all the bribes, threats, and pleas in the world. I would personally not want to be with someone like that, but  I also think you have to know what you are dealing with, if that's the case. If she will never hold down a job again, maybe it's time to say ""No thanks."" If this is a temporary thing because of your job and/or pregnancy, that's a different situation.

  The military does offer family counseling, and so do many local church groups, plus you can pay for it privately. You need to pursue that, if you wish to stay together. I know I'm going to say ""let her"" and that's going to come off in a bad way, but seriously, do not let her get involved with any sort of MLM. No scentsy, no plexus, none of that. She can teach online, go to school for a degree, or trade, start a home childcare center,  all of that. If you two agree on her staying home, she can get into volunteering. Just do not, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, get into MLM. So many spouses get into that crap because if you want to work, it honestly can be quite hard to have to uproot every few years, and these schemes market themselves to people in that situation very well. These things are heavily pushed by a lot of the dependents. DO.NOT.DO.IT.  I suggest family therapy, if you want to make this work, and having a conversation about goals. It may be that you two are ok with her staying home with the baby for a year or two, and then you want a plan of action. What are the expectations if she stays home with the child, as far as housework and all of that goes? Start working on this together. What are the expectations about when she goes back into the work force, or gets job training?

NONE OF THAT is relevant to her abusing you though. Decide if you do want to stay together, and go from there. You *have* to get family counseling if you stay together. She has attacked you numerous times now.

You have outgrown your friendships perhaps, and while you don't need to cut contact and leave them forever necessarily, you do need to put emotional distance between you and your friends who are dragging you down. Go and get involved with groups where you can find other people to be around.

"
"I don't think you should let her move in, but if your husband, who grew up with the same parents, believes his sister's claims of abuse, you should consider taking them seriously. As two people who grew up in that house, they know something you don't."
"Don't marry her. 

When you marry someone you marry their family. If you go ahead with this wedding you're most likely going to be dealing with her treating your family very poorly for the rest of your life."
"So should her boyfriend. Unemployed, won’t take care of his child, bails on every responsibility to play video games - both of them are real catches."
Him being a controlling shithead is not your fault. Dump him. He gave you permission that you didn't need and then blew up when you followed through. Don't waste your time on someone who deliberately hurt you and set out to humiliate you. 
"I understand you need help, but your boyfriend is under no obligation to cancel his already made plan, especially since he made that plan when you said you wouldn't need help. You also need to be considerate of your boyfriend's roommate, who set aside time to hangout when they could have been doing something else. It wasn't wrong to ask, and you can even ask if he could come over when he's free, but you can't be annoyed when he says 'no'."
"As a man, I would want to be there every step of the way for your pregnancy. A lot of people here are saying he doesn't understand, whatever, or that you should be more clear, BUT, men should take initiative in caring and offering sympathy, and asking for a couple of days off when you need to go to the doctor. I'm telling you, if it were me and my girl in your guys' position, I'd feel so bad about going to work and missing her appt to the point where her mom had to come instead of the father of the baby. And even then, asking for more days to work. I wouldn't just laze around and drink while you asked me specifically to do something so I don't have to do it later when you're home and we can just relax TOGETHER, because that's what being a partner is about. But hell maybe he is clueless, and if he is, then you do need to be extremely up front. not just say 'up to you'. Say 'I need you here, please come.' And maybe then he will start to see how much stress you're truly going through all by yourself. "

"I have actually been in your exact situation - I had mild pre-e for the last three weeks of my first baby and then had pre-e for about 12 weeks with my second child, including ten weeks of bed rest and a ton of monitoring and appointments. It’s scary and frightening and hard and I totally get why you need more support. The good news is that your doctor is taking it very seriously and doing exactly what they should be doing  to help you and the baby stay safe and get as far in the pregnancy as you can. My husband is also a bit like Jack in that he sometimes assumes I don’t need emotional support when I do. 

Jack is not being very supportive and helpful and there are definitely a lot of things he could be doing better, but you also need to start communicating more clearly with him if you want your relationship to work. When I married my husband, someone gave me the best relationship advice I’ve ever received: Don’t set your partner up for failure by expecting them to read your mind. You are setting Jack up to fail by not clearly communicating what you need, expect and want from him. Ask him to leave work to come to you. Tell him how you are feeling. Ask for and tell him what you need. When he asks if he’s going home after work, tell him no, he needs to come to the hospital. Send him links about pre-e or ask him to come with you to talk to the specialist so he knows more about what’s happening (a lot of people don’t know much about pre-e and don’t understand what a big deal it is until someone they love has it). 

It would be nice if our partners could intuitively know when and what we need, but it’s not practical. You will be a lot happier if you learn to communicate your needs to him. 

Best of luck to you and your little one - I hope you are able to make it a few more weeks and I’m sending good thoughts for a healthy baby and mom! "
"Your wife is trying to take the place of a trained, licensed therapist. There's a reason why these people go through years of training. They know what they're doing, your wife doesn't. Just because she's imitating their questions and techniques doesn't mean she understands how and why and when to use them. Not to mention the subjective and biased reactions to your responses she will inevitably have. 

Find a third party therapist, alone or together, and work on things from there."

"You are not being a good parent if you don't go after what your child is entitled to.  You are selfish and not giving her what she needs from both parents.  No one cares about your drama or feelings for her father.  Child support isn't a punishment, it is what a responsible parent sets up for the security of their child.  Custody agreements are even more important.  Even if you don't get a dime, your child matters enough to be represented properly.

Child support is also first come, first serve.  If baby mama 2 goes after support, you will get a greatly reduced amount if you ever do the right thing and go after it as well.  I bet she doesn't want to make friends because she thinks you're a sucker.  She'll have him in jail soon for being a deadbeat... Which is what you should have done years ago."
Ding ding ding! And we have a winner! 
"This. There's a lot of people here essentially blaming you for your boyfriend's self-image. But while you can - and tried to! - *support* his self-image, *he needs to be receptive to that support* instead of shutting it down as fake or BS. *He* has work to do. Ideally with a counsellor.

In my experience, one of the more productive questions to ask of person who's been brainwashed by their own insecurity is: ""Is that how *you* see *me?* Do you wish you could leave me for a supermodel? Do you wish I had smaller vagina? Or, do you love and desire me for who and what I am?"" It won't make him feel better, but it may help him clue in that he's thinking in an insecure, distorted way instead of in a sane, grounded way.

Also, the language of convention as it pertains to looks may be helpful. Like, ""Sure, by conventional standards, Jacob is good looking. But convention is racist. Convention is sizeist. Convention is shallow. Convention is stifling. Convention is bullshit. I'm not looking for a convention. I can't love a convention. I'm looking for *you*. I'm loving *you*."""
"Your third paragraph is so true. I quit my job to stay home and turned into a supermom. Perfect house, perfect meals, volunteered for everything at their schools and sports. My drive to organize and run things never went away, I just channeled them into other things. 

Staying at home is a big choice. As some one who’s done it for a long time, I would suggest she keep a foot in the door. Because it’s very hard in some jobs to get back in. But if you guys can financially afford it and she wants to stay home, she should. She can always change her mind. "

"Kaitoy1011 is correct.   This is a classic conditioned response.  She’s being reinforced by the family’s laughter/attention.  Do people pay attention to her at other times or is this her primary method of gaining attention?  
It’s really unfair of your family to do this to you and to the the child.  Likely they don’t realize how detrimental this is to your relationship with your sister.
Can you speak to your parents for support?  If they see that this is upsetting you, they may be willing to help.
It’s likely easily fixed with consistent planned ignoring of the tears.  Try to get the support of your family in this endeavor.  Show them your post, if you’re comfortable with that.

"This whole ""confession"" thing that seems to be in vogue among the kids these days is a terrible approach to dating. Don't vomit up your feelings onto someone and then put the ball in their court to do something about it. Ask them out, spend time together, develop mutual feelings. And when you ask them out, be explicit that it's a date and not as friends; don't try to worm your way into feelings under the guise of friendship. That's kinda creepy.

And don't jump directly to ""in love"" with someone you don't know even *likes* you as more than a friend. You gotta slow your roll."

"I think this is a good idea, but I don't think indulging her (even once) would be that bad either.

Maybe do something really special for her that's very cheap? Make her a nice dinner and give her a handmade gift from you or the kids. Tell her you know she's worried about money, so you wanted to do something nice for her that wasn't expensive. Tell her you care that she's worried, and you're okay with being frugal sometimes. This might lower her defenses, because she could feel like she has to be so cheap all the time, because, well, you're probably not. :P Remind her that you're on her side, and you're okay with saving money sometimes. I really think this would make her more comfortable. Still spend as much money as you want on her on occasion, and if she feels bad, then you can refer to all those other times you saved money.

I think validation, when she is just honestly worried, is very important. She may feel a little steamrolled because she really, really does care about keeping expenses low. Make sure she knows 100% that you're on her side and are okay with being frugal in ways that make her comfortable, but that you still are happy to spend money on her sometimes because 1) you want to, and 2) you can afford this.

... One last thing. Please tell her how much money she's saving you guys in childcare and house care costs. :) Baby sitting/daycare/house cleaning are all fulltime jobs that pay money. Do some calculations and let her know the dollar amount that she is actually contributing. Let her know that you guys are making financially sound decisions, and a lot of it is because she's saving you guys money!"
"Yeah, I know someone who got it and it moved further inside her and became stuck. She had to have it surgically removed and now she’s now being told the damage is the reason she’s having trouble getting pregnant.

Also, there are still plenty of men around your age without said baggage, and even more who might have a little but who definitely aren't abusive assholes like your SO sounds to be. Lots and lots and lots of guys (myself included) only really become ready for a fully serious, long-term relationship by ~ 30 yo after they've finally got their career settled and learned from the mistakes of their 20s.

"If he's offended, it's on him. When a person rejects normal, polite cues and forces another person into atypical bluntness to drive a point home, they own any hurt feelings all by themselves. Most of the time it's not that your message is unclear anyway, it's that your recipient is trying to change your mind or wear you down. 

""Pushy Guy, I need to know we're on the same page and you're acknowledging what I have to say here - I'm not interested in pursuing a dating relationship with you. It's uncomfortable when you keep suggesting it, so unless you stop bringing it up we're going to have to stop spending time together."" 

If he persists, follow through. ""Okay, your decision is to not spend time with me."" And then don't hang out with him further. "
Post history indicated custom made wedding dress... they could just be actually wealthy. Not to mention that she has posts asking for services where people run errands.
"Has he expressed to you what his end goal of this is? Or what he's hoping to get out of it?  ""Autonomy"" in this situation seems a bit vague. "
Your age difference when you got together is likely at the core of this issue. This is what happens when barely-adults get with people 10 years their senior.
"Yep!! Been there done that. If OP wants her money back then there WILL BE criminal charges filed. And you’re  not going to want to let this go. Let your friend answer for her actions in court. If it’s her first offense she can probably work out restitution and probation but she might very well go to jail. She deserves jail quite frankly, ordering 20 grand in take out?!!? She’s a loser and a thief. "
Seriously. I've cut off shitty friends for a lot less than stealing $20K.
"Seriously OP what are you talking about? She deserves a criminal conviction. $20,000 in a year! Call the police oh my god!"
"&gt;When you have unique/objectively non-mainstream opinions I think the onus is on you to make sure your loved ones understand that/are aware.

They've been together for 5 years. If he didn't even consider the possibility that she might have a problem with mined diamonds he's either incredibly dim or straight up doesn't care about her ethical values, neither of those are a good look."

"Right?! This was my thought, too. Why not just help her into the shower at the parents and clean her up (just rinsing off, not even a deep scrub) and borrow some clothes from the mom or maybe sister? I’m sure people would assume she puked and needed fresh clothes if they saw her leave that way, but nothing screams “I SHIT MYSELF” like being carried out of the house with a towel wrapped around your ass. "
"wow, interesting story. I could tell you nearly the same story about my narcissistic ex. I wish I had paid attention sooner because he really did some damage to me. Think about it this way, if she talks to her teammates and peers on the court that way, what's to stop her from treating you that way? Nothing. Nothing but a bit of time. "
"I'm not 100% sure this is all on the girlfriend - I have seen a lot of people get fucked up in a lot of different ways, but what OP described sounds more like an actual illness or food poisoning. The pain, the vomiting and uncontrollable shitting - doesn't sound like your standard ""oops I drank too much and my body tried to get rid of it"". I do know of one guy who shat himself at a party, but it turned out it was because an ex of his spiked his drink with a strong laxative - something unlikely to have happened at a family gathering. This woman could have been genuinely ill and OP just blamed it on her being drunk and high, and treated her terribly callously as a result. "
"I wouldn't bother saying anything. I would also reconsider how much power you give SS over your lives. She's scary- is she going to physically harm you? If not, why are you all hanging out with her if she's a crappy person?"
"I'm guessing that his power play about rent is a ploy to force you to quit school so that you stay underpaid and  underemployed so that it's harder to quit him like a bad habit. 

1. Lock down your birth control if it isn't already. Preferably with something he has zero control over, like an IUD. Getting you pregnant would be another great way to control you. 

2. Create a Plan B for yourself. Figure out who you can stay with-family? Roommate? Rent a bedroom through Craigslist? You don't need to execute NOW, but you need an idea how to support yourself because...

There is no good way to talk through a relationship issue that is, at the base, caused by one partner believing the other is not fundamentally worthy of decency and respect. You can try counseling--maybe he had a toxic childhood and can work through it--but I doubt it. He has it great!!! A fancy apartment and a live-in maid who he treats like garbage. 

If you want to try, do so, but be prepared for this to end. Badly. Get your ducks in a row so you're okay no matter what. "
"Are you okay with him, flirting with that woman?  No? Then tell him that and don't let him dismiss your feelings with the bullcrap that he is like that with all women. Set the boundaries and if he breaks them ask yourself if you want to be with someone who doesn't give a fuck about your feelings."
"If those ages are correct, you need to get out if for no other reason than she is a loser who couldn't cut it in real life with anyone her own age, so she preyed on you. "
"I'm not saying that she's wrong, I'm saying that she ought to define her goals if she's really going to dedicate herself to this lifestyle. 

Maybe she already has and just didn't put it in the post, but her BF didn't know about it for sure."
"Yes, you did actively make this happen. It didn't just happen. You actively put more effort into your friendship with this girl than your relationship with your girlfriend. You actively built an emotional connection with her by sharing intimate details of your life with her and spending so much time with her. You even admit that you are prioritizing time with Clare over time with your girlfriend.

She's your coworker, but it isn't necessary to be anything but professional with her. You should've been 100% professional with her when you realized you had a crush and cut everything else out, instead of indulging in it. You can't have both here, it isn't fair to anyone. "
"You're parents to a fussy and cranky baby who you bring with you to social outtings.  I think it's really as simple as that.  No one is blaming you or the baby, there are obviously good reasons why your daughter is like that right now.  But, come on, it's entirely disruptive and makes conversation 100% more difficult when a child is crying and  fussing through an entire dinner.  

Maybe offer to join them on an outting while you leave the kid and your husband at home.  Your daughter won't care or remember.  No one is insulting either of you - but it's just a fact that a crying child is about the most grating sound in the world."
"I would not call reopening a trauma ""an inconvenience at best."" It is not OP's responsibility. "
I don’t see how it’s compromising. I asked him. It’s not like I went behind his back and did what I wanted. 
So you have time to be in a dance group but not work a part time job? 
"I was waiting for the insane part....but it never happened! Why are you opposed to a part\-time job? All students should have at least some work that pays, if you have time to travel you have time to work. Why are you prioritising travel with friends over a useful internship? Why are you entitled to your parents money when you seemingly have no intention of working in your spare time or over your breaks? Student debt will not ruin your life. Stop being entitled, stop being hysterical and get on with things. "

"OK, so firstly no matter what all the other slut shamers on here tell you. Sleeping with someone on a first date isnt wrong. People can also wait till the third date, sleep with someone and then disappear.  Ive slept with people on a first date and never seen them ever again. My ex I also slept  on the first date and we were together for years.

Second, who cares what the web says. How old are you?

Thirdly. Its only 4 days chilllaaaaax.

Finally. You can choose to contact someone whenever you feel like. Why not drop him a text and just ask him how hes doing. If there is no response, sadly theres your answer. You will be fine. If he answers then great.

Best of luck"
Yes she said she was inviting a good friend over for coffee. Then the kid asked me what my name was and shook my hand. Then we just chatted for a while. It should've been a nice time but I was uncomfortable as fuck the whole hour.
"&gt;the big issue is Trust. How do I trust her any more?

You can't. It would take me a decade of careful trust-building to rehabilitate this level of betrayal.

 She fucking *robbed* you and wasn't even going to *tell you*. If she was willing to just take that much money all in one go, and just act all normal, basically lying to you in the intervening weeks-- I'd be wondering, is she really new to theft? What else has she stolen that nobody missed? What else does she lie about? 

I would be out of this relationship so fast, it would produce a burst of plasma-light like when those supersonic shrimp bash their claws. 

She's going to move her mom in soon, just you wait. Or mom will steamroll over her and you'll be living with *two* untrustworthy jerks. "
"Seems like lies. Keep your guard up. Save all conversations. Screencap incriminating stuff and back it up somewhere. Get a DNA test if she does end up being pregnant again out of nowhere, which wouldn’t surprise me. 


Good luck man. "
"As it's been several months and there wasnt a single dollar put back in that drawer, i think we can assume no."
This isn't about OPs cooking skills
"Its ultimately your life, your money, but I would caution you against being frugal to the point where you are losing out on experiences. When you are old you will have more time to spend but less energy to do all of the things you would want to do like going on adventures. When you look back on your memories you don't want to see a sea of 'netflix and chill' you want to remember things you did that mattered. Now it doesn't mean that you have to go to a fancy restaurant if they make you uncomfortable, but you should be putting some of your money towards things you do like that may cost some money. I would recommend that you should have a dating budget that you agree to spend, which means that you could splurge on a concert on occasion. Its smart to plan for your future but not to the detriment of your present. It sounds like you should balance it better and I can understand your boyfriends frustration."
They sound like horrible friends and you were right to drop them. 
"I did this for my mother.  It was heartbreaking and we'd never seen this behavior before, so we had no idea whether it was temporary (it was).  

It was the only thing we could do.  It was the right thing to do.  There were no half-measures that would have gotten her adequate help.

She hasn't forgiven ""my father"" for having her committed.  We understand how horrible even the best mental health facilities can be, and we understand why she feels that having her committed was the wrong thing to do.  We'll always disagree.  My dad, who divorced her when her affair outlasted her mania, has let her believe he had her committed all this time.  In reality, he was too lost and devastated watching a woman he loved break and twist so badly.  I was the one who made the calls, and I know I would do it again.

Once she was inside, we lost all contact.  I reached out to friends who are lawyers who helped me know what I could do:  I could communicate her symptoms and provide a list of medications to the medical staff, even though they couldn't admit she was in there being treated by them.  Armed with the information I collected and provided, they found the conflicting meds that led to the mania.  They didn't really talk to me about the break with reality, but that calmed down, too.  It took a while to get her off the daunting drugs she hated that got her stable, but she's off of them and can now recognize hypomania when she's overwrought and heading toward it.

tl;dr:  I had my mom committed.  Mom thinks dad did it and never forgave him, but I did it, and would do it again, mostly because she's okay now. Goodness only knows where it would lead if we'd left her paranoid, sleep-deprived, out of touch with reality, and afraid of everyone but me."
"Handle what? Go to the baby shower, give a gift, play the games, and don't think about the items you gave her or the new ones and definitely don't ever bring it up. Or don't go to the shower if you are that upset about it. Don't bring drama. "
There are plenty of women who have nice butts and are functional human beings. Raise your standards dude 
"Do not feel guilty about telling your boyfriend that his inappropriately close friendship with a co-worker is a deal breaker.  He has been dancing around/over lines that should define an exclusive relationship with you.  

There is absolutely no reason for you to be cool with that.   If he can't do without this other woman ""boosting his ego"", there's no point in your remaining with him. "
"What was his response when you told him to cut off the friendship?

Honestly, this would be a deal breaker for me. He has hidden this from you for 2 years now under the guise of ""friendship"" How can you ever trust him again? Any female friend, colleague etc is going to give you pause now. You trusted your bf to act in a way that wouldn't disrespect your relationship &amp; he blew it. Why would you give him another chance? "
"If your grandparents offered to let you move in with them because they were appalled at your mom's treatment, they aren't likely to rescind the offer just because she's confirmed how abusive she is.

You don't have to convince your mom to let you move out, so stop trying and start focusing your efforts on moving."

Thank you for your input! The complaint about breaking up with him on a weeknight did seem a little silly to me. I don't think there's ever a right time to break up anyways! 
"Its not inappropriate if they're concerned for the children's safety. Its not legal either but its WAAAYYY different than painting them as the evil extended family trying to blacken OP's name and poison his children against him.

"I don’t know your fiancés measurements but I too recently started a health kick to feel better about my body and get... abs. Not sure why you view this as a negative things. My gf has the same issues she always calls me “skinny” and says I’m in perfect shape. I just want to be In the best shape I possibly can. 

I am 23m 6’ and 185 currently sitting at 15% body fat. My goal is to get to at least 12% body fat because that’s when your muscle are noticeably defined. I wouldn’t be to concerned he is probably trying to boost his self confidence and self worth. Atleast that is why I’m doing these things in my life. So far my health physical and mental have improved. What is you biggest issue with him changing his health habits?"
"I guess I just don't understand why you choose to go to a religious based university if you don't actually agree with those beliefs.  You are at a university that has a freaking curfew for adults!  I don't see your friends/roommates behavior changing anytime soon since their mentality is kinda par for the couse with this kind of thing.

Transfer.  Get away from this creepy mentality that suffocates young adults, especially young women."
"and maybe OP truly never was violent. but if he was verbally or emotionally abusive, victims get REAL GOOD at managing the aggressor's responses. placating, making him happy, sweeping unpleasantness under the rug, never making anything a problem, avoiding triggers, staying out of his way, being VERY ATTUNED to the moods that precede an outburst and trying desperately to get another outcome. like decorating a room you don't want to move to that your aggressor wants you to be enthusiastic bout? easy: pretend enthusiasm."
"Are you maybe mistaking ""physical attraction"" for a ""romantic connection""?

Like, putting aside the fact that you think you know better than this woman does how she feels, you aren't doing a very careful analysis of her words and her actions.

Actions sound like physical attraction - she touched you, made out with you, seemed to be ""into"" you. But what she *says* is she doesn't feel a romantic connection - that's different than just being hot for someone.

So for whatever reason, she didn't feel like she connected with you on a deeper, more long-term potential level."
"You need therapy too because you refuse to take any responsibility for your behavior, and you brush off her feelings and experiences as either “no big deal, she should have gotten over it in an hour” or “Well, __I__ don’t remember, so it didn’t happen”. 

Maybe YOU think she should have gotten over it, but she’s hurting. The more you invalidate her, the more she will pull away until she’s gone for good, so if you truly love your daughter UNCONDITIONALLY, listen to her without being defensive. Accept her for who she is, warts and all and don’t make her apologize for who she is. 

You posted her because you say you want to fix things. Do you really, or do you just want to sweep everything under the rug? Your move, mom. 

"
"Good lord yes. ""She hated me. She regularly offered coffee and breakfast, which I've always declined."" these two things are, by and large, very opposite sentiments, and that's overlooking that one is what OP *feels* another person thinks about her, and the other is that person's actual actions that are being miffed. 

I have a list of things I'd like to suggest OP reconsider, but this one is on top and it's shortly followed by a daily presence in someone else's shared home. "
"Seriously. Gina's powerplay had absolutely NOTHING to do with Tyler, and everything to do with the chick who is constantly somewhere in her home, preventing her from truly relaxing. Simultaneously, this chick is actively refusing any attempt on Gina's part to reach out, doubling the discomfort.

I've been in Gina's shoes, and I can tell you her thought process is somewhere along the lines of ""I invited this roommate into my home, I welcomed his SO, but it's been made clear to me that she does not respect me while occupying the space I've provided."" "
"This is an abuser grooming. It's horrible to see every time it comes up – OP, please take this seriously, listen to *your gut instinct* telling you things are not okay, and get out. 

You didn't say or do anything wrong. Keep safe &lt;3"
"It’s not about political correctness. It’s about your feelings. And if he can’t see or value that, he’s not a keeper.

(Not to mention he’s emotionally abusive too.)"
"Exactly! The only thing Tyler should need to say to OP is ""I'm so sorry about how she's been behaving. I'm moving out asap and our friendship is over."" "
"I mean, yeah I too would like to see the other side of the situation because I see where you're coming from with a lot of these points. 

  
HOWEVER, I don't think 99&amp;#37; of roommate situations are chill with coming out and shootin' the shit stark naked. Even if everyone was best friends I don't think that specific aspect would be comfortable for a grand majority of people. THAT was, in my opinion, totally inappropriate on her part. "
"&gt;""This is the kind of politically correct bullshit I hate! 

People who say this, say it because they hate having to think about what they say... instead of analyzing themselves and thinking about whether it actually hurts people or not, they can lash out and blame the people they're insulting for being insulted.

=/

Never seen someone complain about ""politically correct bullshit"" that doesn't just want to be able to say whatever they want without repercussion.

&gt;You should be able to handle my jokes, because you shouldn't be so weak

This is disgusting of him and just proof of what I said. What he *really* hated was feeling guilty for doing something rude and uncaring. So he made it your fault, so he didn't have to feel guilty.

That's manipulative and FUCKED UP.

Don't date people who think being uncaring and unempathetic is okay. You need someone whose default is caring! Sure it was nice of him to get you jalapeno poppers. But you said it yourself that it's rare and you're surprised he even did that... get someone whose kindness and thoughtfulness is so normal that when they surprise you, you're still not ""surprised"" because you know how much of a kind person they are.

When someone tells who they are (even if that's by telling you what other people say about them) believe them! Empathy is extremely important, and if someone is incapable of it, you should ditch them immediately."
"Have you thought about trying to find a middle ground between complete off-grid self-sufficient life and city-dwelling office drone? Do you think you'd enjoy farming, or even just working as a farm labourer without owning a farm yourself? You drive a tractor, work the land deal with animals, and get to see the fruits of your labour, but it's not as precarious of a life as trying to be completely self-sufficient with zero income.  I grew up on a farm and I have some of the fondness for it that you seem to have for your life.

But I guess I'll caution you that as a child you were very likely sheltered from the stresses of trying to live that lifestyle because you were relatively free of responsibility (or had child-sized responsibilities). It's quite a different thing when it's all squarely on your shoulders."
"All of this! Yes, her behavior is passive-aggressive, but it sounds like she’s tried to address it with her roommate (which is what she should do), and he didn’t deal with the issue. 

I’d be losing my mind if some random (to me) human was in my house every day. Doesn’t matter if you’re in your bf’s room. You’re still there. 

Also, it sounds like she’s been cordial to OP despite OP’s less-than-stellar behavior. She offered wine and coffee? I’m not sure anyone could offer those things rudely. (I’m kidding somewhat, but I’m just not sure where OP is finding the hate in these gestures.)"
"No, you really didn’t give her a chance, and then on top of that, you’re rude to her *in her own home*, where you seem to be on a regular basis. It would not surprise me to find out Gina had been trying to minimize your visits for a while, and the naked conversation was her power move to get you to leave. You like your space and want people to tell you before they encroach on your personal space, but does Gina ever get a heads up on when you’ll be in her space? Imagine how on edge you would be if you walked into your bedroom and Gina was sitting there. You need to learn some empathy, OP.  Gina’s naked scene was over the line, but it definitely sounds like the actions of someone with nothing to lose, not someone who’s trying to steal your man."
Tell him to save the theatrics for downstairs. ;)
"Considering she's probably gonna fake a miscarriage soon \- tell him. My fiance was him. Minus the shitty partner part. He's not an idiot though and finally caught on between her lack of showing AND a distinct lack of doctor's visits.

If you want to be subtle ask him about her doctor's appointments or if he's showing off the sonogram pic to everyone yet."
"I can't come during normal sex, and I too hate when guys say that. It's supposed to be sexy or something but... yeah no. 

I basically just say to my partners (and what might be good for you) is, ""hey, when you say that it actually puts a lot of pressure on me to come and makes it more difficult and less fun. I'd prefer if you focused on just making me feel good over just trying to make me come and it would be a lot more enjoyable overall.""

For me, what makes me come isn't even what necessarily feels the best, so it's not something I want to focus on during sex. Idk if it's the same for you, but if it is that might also be a good thing to bring up. Communication is always important! Good luck!"
"Oddly enough I remember getting really emotional and feeling betrayed when both my parents cut off their long hair. My dad didn't look like any man I knew and my mom's hair was the epitome of beauty. I don't know how vocal I was about either cut, I was well under 10 tears old lol"
"Well, all I can say is that this is how I taught my kids to treat animals correctly. You also need to perpetually REMIND them about it, unfortunately, because kids forget - and you need to monitor them around animals as well. I do think you need to talk to her parents about it because it does sound like she's pretty defiant."
"What are you looking for with your post? Everyone here is telling you what your friend wouldn't, which is that either she didn't want it, or that she did and then changed her mind or whatever, but instead of taking any answers you just keep reiterating how it bothers you.

"I mean, he plainly explained what his intentions are. If you aren't okay with that then you shouldn't lead yourself into a situation with expectations that something other than what's been made clear could happen.

"Bad news travels fast. A death doesn't get 'leaked', it's very public, very important information. More than just teenagers will be talking about this - parents, family friends, school officials - they will all be discussing it. If you don't reach out soon, someone else with reach out to you. I would call around to mutual friends to get the story. 

Talk to your parents. Have them check their connections. People know people. "

"The translation of ""I don't want to be in a relationship"" is ""I don't want to be in a relationship with you"". Sorry... but you get mad respect for putting yourself out there. And having the guts to say that you don't just want to be friends. But you need to move on now. Find someone who wants to be with you. You deserve that."

"If you really want to bring something, bring a classic that is almost no-fail. Try chocolate chip cookies, coconut macaroons, brownies, or a fruit crumble.  Worry more about texture and flavour than appearance. I find that Pinterest often sacrifices flavour and eatability for looks, which will be hard for a novice cook to achieve anyway. Traditional classics may not feel super exciting for you, but you have to master basics before attempting challenges. "
"Nope. Totally inappropriate. I would be pissed if I walked in on something like that. It sounds like it's time to have a serious discussion to put some boundaries in place. If he wants to be in a relationship with you, he'll respect your feelings. "
"Your bf tried to protect you gently but you kept pushing him to elaborate.  Are you disappointed he didn't lie to you just to protect your ego?  You don't want that in a relationship, you want to trust a partner to tell it like it is.  You're much more likely to always know where you stand with someone that way.  

He knows his family and you don't.  When push came to shove, he was open and honest with you, but his family doesn't know or love you, and they may be a bit more honest in their reactions.  These people might be downright rude, or just unable or unwilling to hide negative reactions.  Even if they themselves try to protect your feelings, he doesn't want to hear negative comments behind your back, or feel like you've unintentionally embarrassed yourself.

Your bf may have hurt your feelings, but that doesn't change the fact that he thinks your cooking could be better, even if it's ok enough for him to eat.  So if you need to feel hurt, feel hurt, but he did nothing wrong.  In fact he was right to tell you the truth since you were insisting on it."

"Yeah, this does sound a bit like manipulative and selfish behavior. Especially the first situation -- she told you she was going to take an Uber. How were you supposed to ""read"" that meant her drunk friend was actually driving her home?

You are not being a piece of crap by breaking up with her. Relationships should be an ""emotional toll"". if she is making you feel bad, then breaking up with her makes sense.

It will hurt her, but she'll get over it. I promise. People break up with each other all the time and live."

It sure seems like that, doesn’t it? I think it’s I’ve always been a people pleaser to the point where people start walking all over me. Now I don’t let them walk all over me and suddenly it’s me being “selfish”. It’s just one drama to the next. At least I have supportive friends though "
"In the UK it's recommended that mother's continue to breastfeed as long as they are comfortable doing so.

"It depends on how her conditions are spelled out in the will. If the will merely states ""take care of his brother"" that is vague and can mean any number of things. Buying him $100 worth of groceries each month would fulfill this stipulation. However if it actually spells out ""paying for brother's auto insurance"" then you are in a much different situation and he could reasonably bring a case to probate court to recover the auto\-insurance payments he is owed if you don't pay. 

You should consider a consultation with a lawyer who specializes in estate and probate laws. They would be able to assist in writing out a clear will."

"It’s just so weird. My mom died 20 years ago, and we got tons of support, an aunt died 6 years ago, and we got lots of support. We’ve gotten lots of phone calls, but the house is kinda silent. People admittedly liked my dad more than my stepmom, and with his age, lots of his closest friends have passed, but I’m just kinda shocked. "
"That's kind of you to say.  I do believe that while it wasn't a malicious mistake, it was still a negligent one, albeit one that I have learned from. 

My step mother is absolutely a wonderful person.  I vividly remember her kindness when she approached me and told me she didn't want this to be a wedge in our relationship. It must have been devastating for her; that was likely her all time favorite cat. However, we still have a strong relationship to this day."
Is he going to have a church funeral? You could ask them for some support. My grandma's church had a group of volunteers to facilitate wakes and whatnot. 
"&gt;After asking my girlfriend what she'd like to do for dinner she starting sending passive aggressive and sporadic texts (i.e. ""I didn't think you'd be out so long, brunch AND dinner?"") I told her we didn't have a set plan but that I wanted the day to be about my mom and was asking what she wanted us to do.

A day long open-ended plan DOES NOT FLY when you have a one year old. You should have set firm plans with your mom and said to your GF, we're leaving at X time and will be home at Y time, is that OK with you?"
"Does it happen monthly and leave you unable to walk? That is far beyond a normal stress response. Nausea, headache, general malaise are all within the realm of normal, but weakness to the point of having difficulty walking sounds a lot more like an autoimmune condition to me."
"If im your boyfriend and this is only a 6 month relationship.  I'd be gone.

No matter how honest your mistake was, it looks terrible from his vuew.

He's probably going to ask advice from people and they'll all rightfully going to tell him you're cheating even though you're not.

"
"Again, maybe you should do it. You want her to understand what she is doing. 

It’s very easy to say that something won’t bother you. Sometimes we have to actually be in the situation to realize we would be uncomfortable. It would be easier for her to see that this is weird if you were scrolling through her messages with a best friend or family member. You could force empathy in this situation. "
"That's terrible advice. Stay out of it until something happens? Sure. He can whisper in her comatose ear on her hospital bed, ""Oh...by the way, my brother can be a bit abusive. Good luck with the reconstructive surgery, sweetie.""  

This is OP's *brother*. Just because he doesn't have ""all the facts"" doesn't mean he doesn't know his brother's tendencies. These are gut feelings and shouldn't be ignored."
"There is a point in a marriage where you need to focus on yourself.  Your entire post is focused on helping her recover from a multitude of issues, some self inflicted some not.

What about you?  You also deserve to be happy and fulfilled in life.  You have gone above and beyond in this marriage and nobody is going to blame you if you walk away so that you can find happiness."
"Your first responsibility is to your husband \(and your marriage\), not your mother. "
"I think your fiance is correct about not wanting to push you towards a decision. These are your parents and ultimately it needs to be your decision. If he says ""they're not invited"" it leaves the door open for you to be resentful in the future. And I think it is wise for your fiance to recognize that. The two of you can discuss it at length and you can discuss it with us. But it is ultimately your call. 

I have a friend who's in laws were uninvited to the wedding. They do not regret that decision. And are happy with it 5 years later. Just as in your case, her husband had to ultimately make the call about HIS parents. "
"Exactly, if he can't keep a small secret, what big ones has he blabbed about? Can he be trusted to keep important information private? OP hasn't mentioned what he did to break her trust, after their son was born. "
It's a babying behavior\- something you would do to a much younger girl and no longer appropriate now that your daughter is a teen. It also has a sexual undertone to it since you're basically stroking her head. 
"2nd gen narcissist, kinda like Pokémon, they are all narcissist but from different generations! 


Except no one wants to catch them or be around them in general.

"She's likely hiding her medication from you because she feels embarrassed. I had an ex who was on antidepressants and I didn't know until I found a bottle while cleaning. I think you should ask her about the medication but it's not a big deal.

As for her interests and hobbies, hey, she sounds like me and some of my friends! My husband even made a joke about it in our wedding vows. It's really not a big deal. I definitely don't want to murder anyone. There is a ton of content about these subjects out there because people find it fascinating. Just because people like learning about things doesn't mean that they want to emulate them. My BFF is obsessed with Grey's Anatomy but she doesn't want to be a doctor. 

The fact that you're trying to change her hobbies is a way bigger red flag than any she's displaying."
"It's not selfish at all. He should be putting the priorities of his marriage before his mom's inconvenience/irresponsibility. You are kind of under\-reacting here if you ask me. He is not being an equal partner to you if he is putting his mom before you. You sacrafice for him, and he sacrafices for mom? Not the waya marriage works at all."
"I've been married for twenty years.  At this point, I wouldn't want to know.  If it was over AND he was sorry AND he was committed to working on our marriage and himself - I'd rather not know.  We have a child, we have a life together, I'm not sure I'd want to have to deal with something that was already over.  Physical affair?  That other people knew about?  Different story.

Two years in with no kids, I'd want to know.  I'd have more options and wouldn't have already spent half my life in this relationship.

I think you should tell her, but you need to have some personal therapy, couple's therapy, and other things lined up to prove you are willing to be IN your marriage and work on it.  I think too many people think they can say sorry and it's over, what more do you want?  And the answer is A LOT."
he is manipulating you 
"Well first of all, having sex in public like that is a CRIME.  I know he’s probably horny but you do not want a sex offender label following you for the rest of your life over a 3 week old relationship. Second, you’re not comfortable with something very intimate potentially being very public, that’s very understandable. I wouldn’t compromise on this, if y’all don’t last you don’t last but it’s such a new relationship and it’s not worth the potential embarrassment/ criminal record. "
"Hell no. He is in the wrong, majorly.

Personally, I wouldn't stay with someone like that. I would have left after the second time he cheated."
"This is a terrifying response. If you don't see how this guy is manipulative, you obviously have a fair few issues of your own to work on. Jesus fucking Christ. He forced her to change into an outfit to his liking and told her she needed to lose weight on their first date. This is mandatory reporting level stuff."
"“While she sat on his lap” 

Lol ya know men pay for that right, and your wife is doing it for free man. 
Why didn’t you stop her?! Why did you LET HER sit on his lap?! Like wtf. 

You keep blaming your wife and yeah she seems like a really horrible person to be married too but dude, you’ve never given any consequences for her behavior and you said so yourself that you would never demand her to stop. And that’s your problem right there. You should have demanded this stop long ago. "
Or him.  You think stringing him along isn't also going to ruin his life?
"Problem is, if you don't expose him, you will probably end up being charged with knowing what you know and losing everything yourself. It'll be easy for him to say that you knew.

 Be safe and don't get into trouble for someone doing fraud."
"It is not normal or healthy to expect you to abandon your friends and family when you get married to spend 100% of your time alone with your spouse. A loving and emotionally healthy spouse would never expect that of their partner.

There is absolutely no reason to think that things will just ""get better"" on their own. If you want to wait to see if that happens, that's your choice, but it's very unlikely.

It sounds like you have tried to talk to her about it, tried to compromise, tried to get her to consider talking about this with a professional, and she has refused to consider any possible alternative other than that you do what she wants and act happy about it. That sounds very oppressive to me. I would not want to be in a marriage where my partner showed such disregard for my feelings and wishes. I'm not going to advise you what to do, but if I were in that position I would insist that my partner respect my right to spend time with other people and otherwise be an autonomous human being rather than a robot; I would make clear that I would be absolutely happy to discuss the matter in couples' therapy; and if my partner was unable to accept that, I would end the relationship. I cannot imagine spending the rest of my life in a situation where I had no freedom. I feel like even when you were voluntarily doing what she wanted, it would be tainted by knowing you had no other choice."

"I don't think it's a quilt, though.  OP said it was a shadowbox cross-stitch . . . which probably means she has a pattern, unless she's a freehander."
"Or maybe a receipt of the materials purchased? I know it sounds excessive but if it’s what’ll show your cousin you made it then so be it. So upset for you, that’s just horrible. "
There's no rabies in the UK.
"&gt; The fact that you said she snooped and you didn’t giver her “permission” is a bit fucked up on your part. You’ve been dating for 3 years it’s only snooping if you have something to hide.

BS.  It's snooping when the other person hasn't given you permission.  A relationship does not require that you abdicate all individuality and privacy.  In fact, that's a pretty quick way to relationship fail.  If you and your SO have agreed on this way forward, awesome, but don't put that on everyone else who hasn't agreed."
Why do people need their clothes removed to sleep off a drunk spell?
"I am a woman from Europe and I'd punch someone in the face for straight up ordering for me. Suggest, yes. Order for me as if I'm a child, no. "
"&gt;But you are not unreasonable here, with the story as you've presented it.

Hate to break it to ya, but her BF isn't unreasonable either. He showed up at her house in the morning and found another dude there unannounced. It's a highly suspicious set of facts. And OP sounds like she does have an innocent explanation. But it is objectively a suspicious situation.

Can you REALLY blame the guy for being suspicious in those circumstances?

I mean, suppose we had a post from the BF saying ""went over to my gf's house in the AM and there was another dude there that she is super close to. she says she was just sick, but didn't tell me that she was sick or ask me for help. what do, reddit?"". At least like 50% of the comments in that post would be ""she's cheating, break up"""
"Early to mid-20s is when you start really figuring out what kind of people you want in your life. It speaks very highly of your girlfriend's character that she defended you when you weren't around to defend yourself, and she may very well be thinking twice about whether or not these are the kinds of people she wants to invest in. Bear in mind that it's not easy to drop an entire friend group, so don't think that because she didn't immediately cut contact it means she approves whatsoever of the things they said."
"&gt; he says he doesn't care that much about himself

This honestly is a huge red flag to me. It signifies underlying problems with his self image that will manifest increasingly throughout his lifetime."
"Yeah....that response combined with the wife's fb page being all about her family really make me think, like you said, that them getting divorced is a bunch of bs. 

Send her the pics and vids of their kids. She def needs to know about that, too, and to know what kind of person she really married. He's got her fooled. "
"Your wife  is wrong, it's not acceptable.  As Shirley Glass says in *Not Just Friends*: ""To look is human, but flirting signals that you are available. You’ve sent out an invitation of receptivity and are ready to see who says yes.""  Sending that invitation is crossing a line and disrespectful of your marriage.

Your friends may be used to it but even they find it awkward and uncomfortable.   

She was probably raised among women who did this (or learned to get what she wanted from male relatives this way) ...and it if you look closely, you'll find a lot of infidelity and/promiscuity on one or both sides of her family.  Your wife doesn't take your concerns seriously because, as she said, you haven't expressed your discomfort about it strongly enough.  

She needs professional help to understand that her behavior is not okay.   She's not being friendly, she's being disrespectful to you, your marriage, and your fiends.   You can start with some couples counseling sessions; which will probably evolve into some long term individual counseling for her.  If as you say, she's worse with alcohol, that needs  to be addressed too.  "
"You’re not being objective. He didn’t like you enough to date you. He liked his wife enough to marry her. He hasn’t contacted you in years. As someone who is in a long term relationship (engaged), he probably never thinks about you. I don’t even remember the names of people I flirted with that never evolved into a relationship. Respectfully, I would bet all my life savings that you couldn’t wreck his marriage even if you tried. Best to just ctrl+z him from your life. Block in everything and get some therapy."
"That sounds incredibly rough, I'm sorry."
"I apologize for being blunt, but just break up with her and find someone mature. That's a stupid excuse and rude to put the blame on you for ""overreacting."" She was obviously shocked that you found out and got damn defensive. the fuck is ""it's no big deal and stop overreacting?"" "
"&gt; How do I still make him feel special while establishing some spending boundaries?

If this guy needs:

* Two brewery parties

* A day at an amusement park

* A concert with big-name artists

* A fancy dinner

* A fancy hotel

* Baseball tickets for a certain game in a certain seating section

* AND a fancy hat

Just to feel special, then I honestly don't know what to tell you.

Any *one* of those things is a great present. Any two of them would definitely make for an all-out birthday blow-out. But all SEVEN big-ticket items? That's just obscene. The fact that he's *asking* for more is really distateful. 

&gt; he also went ahead and planned it all himself before I could do anything

Good, then he can pay for everything. 

Just be honest. ""Babe, I love you, and I want to celebrate how much I love you on your birthday. I can afford to (eg) shout you a fancy dinner at a restaurant, and to buy my own tickets for the concert and amusement park. Anything else is out of my budget.""

&gt; I feel awkward bringing up spending on his birthday after he just saw me spend frankly a whole lot of money on clothes.

Why on earth do you feel guilty for spending your own money on your necessities? 

If my partner made me cupcakes in my favourite flavour for my birthday, I'd feel like the luckiest person on earth. If that isn't good enough for your boyfriend, that's on him."

"OP apart from her being a pain in the ass, you need to talk to your boyfriend about you, because you are involved now, this women sounds crazy and possibly will escalate, I just can’t imagine the mentality that would chase someone like this, it is not heathy.

26f virgin here.  Anyone who judges you for it aren't worth your time.  In fact some women may find it exciting to be able to do things for you that no one else has before and it may take pressure off of them.  Also no need for them to worry about std's.  I myself prefer to date a virgin so we can experience things together.
"I know that there is always the possibility that OP is doing something wrong and she might genuinely not be able to tell what it is exactly (lacks self awareness for instance) but I don't get why everyone here is ignoring the fact that people can really be assholes and exclude you without a legitimate reason. 

From a personal experience I was having an internship in a bank and I worked there for almost 6 months and it was one of the most miserable experiences in my life. My coworkers didn't treat me badly and didn't do anything directly mean to me, but they would generally exclude and ignore me. I spent almost 8 hours each day talking to no one. I know there was an age gap (10 years age gap) and there were no other interns but it still sucks that they didn't even try to get to know me or to make me feel welcome and included.

I ended up not renewing my internship contract (for many reasons) but the main one was because I didn't feel welcome in there. The worst thing was when my manager (he was the nicest of them all btw) asked me why I wouldn't renew my contract and I couldn't say anything. I mean how do you even begin to explain that without being called ""sensitive"" and that it was ""all in your head""? That what sucks about social ostracism, you can never prove it.

I know that we go to work to actually work and we shouldn't count on making friendships there but that's really not my point. We spend half of our day there and I guess at the end we are social creatures and no matter how we try to deny it we can't cope in these kind of situation and even if we do it leaves a long term damage for the person.

My point is there are many work cultures that can exclude new joiners and certain types of people who don't fit with the ""company's culture"" so it doesn't have to be OP's fault.

As for an advice I'm really not sure what to say because it totally depends on you. You can always look for other opportunities or you can suck it up and do your job and be generally nice to them and focus on actually making friendships or meeting your existing friends outside of work. Believe me this can help a bit because you'll at least feel like you are surrounded by people who care about you. "

"He knew. You shouldn't need to defend yourself here. He behaved appallingly even if he didn't know, *but he knew*. Here's the part where my eyes bugged out:

&gt; I told him Dan I need 30 mins to charge my phone and he was like cant you charge it somewhere else, and I just burst out in tears saying its my only way out of here can you not give me that. I couldnt contain my self so just head off in the room and sort of cry he comes in and asks me whats wrong, I tell him about what he said yesterday and he just sorry and left the room.

He wakes you abruptly to throw you out and behaves erratically as fuck (his immediacy about you leaving *is* aggressive behavior, by the way, and absolutely nothing you did warranted that). Then, **he asked you again what was wrong.**

DAN, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK IS WRONG!? Everybody acting like you should have been more communicative needs to sit with this part of your story for a little bit and let it stew. That looks a hell of a lot like Dan may have been trying to gaslight you, and now he's pulling that manipulative ""I hate myself"" garbage over it. He's not a good person trying to make things right, he's dangerous and I'm sorry you had to find out that way, but I'm so glad it didn't turn out worse."

"&gt; I've suggested we go 100% no contact for a while and see if she goes nuclear like I think she might. So what do you guys think? Am I right in this? Should I be doing something different?  

Where is your wife in all this OP. She is the one who needs to stand up to her mom and draw boundaries. Have you ever discussed with her on how toxic her mother is and how it is affecting you and hte relationship. Arent you concerned that it might spill over into your married life.  Cos this is not just a wedding issue, this will contnue t affect your wife and thereby you post marriage too. 

you really need to have a discussion with your wife on this issue and bring up no-contact as a possibel solution. Ask her what she would like to do to stop this BS. And that'll tell you what is likely to happen after the wedding. "

"Any good pediatrician will start asking you to leave the room at some point in the visit (some from the start, some once they’re nearing puberty), because despite what you think kids *do* deserve some level of privacy in their healthcare and it’s essential for us as healthcare providers to give them a safe place.

We’ve had mom’s get pissy about it but it’s just general precautions and care to make sure there’s a chance to say everything they might not want to or even be able to say in front of a parent."

"Yes you are being needy. This is not some casual get-together, he's going out of town. There were arrangements made and money that exchanged hands.

"I’ve always had mixed feelings about my first time, which was casual. In a way, it was good, because it made me feel like I could have sex with people if I wanted to. In a way it was bad, because it definitely affected my self-esteem for a long time - I felt used, and sort of preyed on by an older guy.

If I had it to do over again, I’d have waited for someone I liked a bit more, who was closer to my age. I don’t know if it would have been in a relationship or casual, but I would have avoided the sense of being used for sex, and not being “good enough” to date and take seriously."

""". . .there is no situation EVER where I would drop my BEST FRIEND for a person I was dating if I knew that there was nothing inappropriate about my relationship.""

Totally agree, this is a huge RED flag.  Him dumping her means (a) she is NOT his best friend, and (b) there was something about his relationship with her that he felt threatened his relationship with you.

As for the lying about the tattoo, that is also a RED flag because (a) it indicates some level of conflict in his mind between his relationship with her and his relationship with you, and (b) he thinks it is okay to lie to you.  Whether this is because he thinks you would get mad or because he just didn't want to discuss it with you, the TAKE-AWAY LESSON here is that he is perfectly fine lying to you to cover his own ass i.e. avoid potentially negative consequences.  I suggest seriously considering if this kind of behavior is something you want in your life - because he just showed you another part of who he is, and that's not going to change. "
"Absolutely not. You were a naive 22 year old girl with what was, at best, a crush. 6 years have passed. What is the actual reason you've held on to this infatuation?"
"The whole ""cuddling"" thing is a smokescreen.  I remember someone on this sub before whose boyfriend had a definition of ""hugging"" that meant he would lie down on top of her so she couldn't move or get up.

"He is not being unreasonable, you basically had someone else assume his role. Your excuse of not wanting to bother him is extremely flimsy. If you are sick enough that you need someone there taking care of you then you are probably better off in a hospital, and if that is not a possibility it sure as hell shouldn't be someone other than your boyfriend, specially not without even telling him.

It's quite likely they intended their family to have two/multiple children, and that's why they had another child after your sister died. But that isn't the same as saying literally ""Amy is here to fill the Jessica-shaped hole."" It's more, ""The family isn't the right shape anymore, let's change it.""

I think these feelings you're having probably reflect some unhappiness in yourself, some sort of low self-esteem. My mother had a traumatic late miscarriage before me, and she did talk about it. So when I was struggling with my self-esteem I did think perhaps she had wished I was the one who died. Well, it turns out that while the miscarriage was very traumatic, the ""what ifs"" of the actual baby were not really a thing for them. They certainly weren't dwelling on what life would have been like if that baby had lived. That line of thinking was entirely in my head and a product of my own feelings of not being valid/good enough/whatever. 

Your situation is a little different - I imagine your parents do imagine the young woman your sister would have been if she'd lived. But I very much doubt they're looking at you as a mirror for her (actual or intended). No one knows better than a parent of multiple children that they're all different.

I think you need to get some counselling to work on your self-esteem. I think this history has gotten tangled up in your mind with what you're grappling with, but I don't think one really caused the other."

"Adjust to her social norms???  Whaaaat?!  Let's be clear here. Her social norms are exactly and only that - HER norms. No-one in a decent relationship goes around putting up with their partner snogging other guys.  

You, Mr. 29yo, haven't a snowball's chance in Hell of maintaining a long term satisfactory relationship with this woman.  It a corney cliche but she, my internet friend, is the drug and you are the addict and she is bad for your health.

"My husband never even told his office he was married, let alone engaged. One of his coworkers literally wrote in a card to him ""I'll never forget when you just randomly showed up one day with a wedding ring on!"" He worked there throughout our entire 2 year engagement and took a week off for wedding and never told anyone in his office lol. It bothered me then but I ignored it and now I see this pattern with a lot of other things. 

I wish I had a husband that was more proud of this, so my advice to you would be that if this is bugging you now, it may become a bigger issue in the future."
"Plus she has a history of trickle truthing so it’s likely they did more than kiss.

And on top of that she doesn’t feel guilty at ALL but is making plans to hang out with her ex

And as if that wasn’t enough no one knows OP exists?

All of those things on their own are enough to break up over.

OP, she is not a nice person. There is no way this will end well. Have some self respect and cut her off. "
"Wait, what? Does the 12yo live with you guys? Why does your wife owe child support? To whom? Where is your step daughter’s father? 

Chalk up whatever financial hit you have to take to be the price of freedom and peace in your life, and let the money you’ve already lost to your leech of a wife serve as a lesson for you moving forward. 

"
"Wait... what? How is YOUR life going to change? Your Dad has a partner... how is this any different if he'd gotten a girlfriend? 

And trust me when I say this: your daughter knows what gay people are.

I'm going to cut you some slack here, because you just lost your Mom. And more than anything, thats whats bothering you I bet. It's not that its a dude, it's not that suddenly your Dad is ""Gay"" \(which he's not\) its that it feels too soon. And that, I get, I really really do. When my Mom passed my Dad has new GF 5 months later. It felt so wrong, like such a slap in the face, like he never really loved her, just totally disrespectful to the pain of losing her. But, here we are 20 years later, and he's still with this woman. In fact, he's now been with her longer than he was with my Mom...  also, ""men of a certain age"" just cannot be alone. I've watched this with all my friends Fathers who become widowers. Most barely make it to six months without finding a new squeeze, its amazing how quickly they do it, seriously, this is a thing, older men seem incapable of being alone. 

So try to think of it like this: would your Mom want him to be alone and sad and lonely or would she want him to get on with life and love again? Cuz you know the answer."
"For god's sake, *not at someone else's wedding!*

It's incredibly rude and mean to the people whose big day it is to steal attention from them and put the spotlight on yourself."
"Ding, ding, ding!

I could date someone tomorrow if I lowered my standards. (And I think they’re low. Have a job, be a decent person, not shit talk their ex and not be bitter) And yet that’s hard to find. One guy was too fresh off his break up. Another told me it would be easier if his ex was dead as then there wouldn’t be issues with his kid. 

And then there’s the guys who just want to fuck you. It’s so common. "
"That's not your problem, that's theirs. "
"&gt;It sounds like he definitely still likes you and he TALKS ABOUT IT to his other friends and family

Not saying this isn't the case, but it's also entirely possible that his family/friends are meddlesome and *assume* he still has a crush on her. Far too many people in this world who like to play matchmaker for those who are unwilling."
"That sounds like the best time to have someone love you and look after you. I don't know more about you than you told me, but you sound very tough and brave. I admire your positivity and your hopefulness. I hope you have a beautiful, healthy baby and a house full of love!! "
Yep. Protect yourself and all the other girls he is trying to take advantage of. You were probably the 153rd underage girl he messaged yesterday.
Your grandpa's behavior is disgusting and disturbing. I second going to the police and going no contact with him.
"Like ladyApsalar said, girls being killed by people like him is a very real thing. You can be seriously harmed by this guy.

Another thing, sending nudes to someone is never a good idea. Even someone you really trust may one day betray you and it's even more likely for some guy you don't know. They can end up on the internet and completely ruin your life and social relationships. Once they are out there, you can never get them back no matter how much you may want to."
"Your ex has convinced them of nothing. They are individuals with agency. You're not even willing to accept the possibility that maybe you *have* been abusive but you don't realize it because it's normal for you. 

You aren't going to get a reconciliation until you accept what they're telling you and at least go to therapy to explore it. And maybe not even then. They don't want contact and yet you're trying to force it instead of respecting what they want, and that in itself is abusive.

"
"So you want him to take it easy on the lovey dovey stuff just because you have?  Have you ever thought that if you did those sorts of things for him that would boost his self-esteem in itself?  
"
"Oh hell no.

You do not send a child to fight adult battles.

How the adults he lets into his life treats his child is OP's dad's problem. "
"Leave, you staying in the relationship where you're clearly incompatible is wrong for both of you. It's not working and he will be fine on his own. He's an adult. He doesn't need to be taken care of. You need to move on and start thinking about and researching how to set your own personal boundaries so you don't get caught in relationships where you're being taken advantage of by people who lie to you and make you feel shitty about yourself. It's not healthy for anyone involved. 

"
Yes exactly this and OP's brother is also giving off some sort of insecure or jealous vibes and perpetuating homophobia while being gay himself. WTF. 
He does not sound like a keeper.
"Thank you for saying this. I didn’t even think about it this way. I just thought he changed his mind about us and didn’t know how to tell me, which is what hurt me in the first place."
"Yeah, OP could be swimming in male prostitutes willing to take her money with a little online searching. Is he proud of her every minute of every day for not banging one of them?"
The problem here is the fact that a big majority of redditors are not capable to give advice. I'm almost 100% sure that this was an innocent thing because in private he is acting really nice.
Go and ask to police to accompany you. Then go there and take your stuff. I'm not sure what you are saying about the furniture - did you buy it half and half together? If so then take half of it (in value). You should probably contact your landlord right now and ask for an early inspection (in case you ex trashes the place) . Pay up until the end of the lease but sleep on friends couches until you find a new place. Good luck. 
"At the same time, it's very frustrating to admit romantic feelings for a girl, her to decline, and then for her to make the pretty extreme assumption that nothing has changed in the friendship. Both people are in frustrating, awkward positions. "

The “other people” here on reddit think you’re pretty smart. 
"An accident would be him slipping on a banana peel and striking your face on the way down. 

This was a **decision** he made.

He might have *accidentally* made a poor decision to hit you which he may or may not regret but the act itself was not an accident. "
Just cancel the appointment and don't make another one.
So your BF thinks it's totally acceptable for you to get sexually harassed. What a keeper.
And now I think this is fake...
"Normal people that get frustrated with a video game go ""Fuck this."" and just turn it off and do something else.

If his reaction to losing a game is to BREAK SHIT AND SCREAM he either needs to lose the games, or he's lost his family.

Children shouldn't have to live in fear every time daddy wants to play a video game."
"Even though it's very minimal exposure they're still going to pick up on her undermining your parenting and disrespecting you in your own home. It's definitely up to you and how you feel about that but personally I wouldn't let that fly, especially as the kids get older and understand better. You don't want to set the precedent that it's okay to be disrespected by family."
"Huh. Guess you'd be shocked at the number of people who value personal freedom over financial gain.

I personally would value the ability to pursue the life I want to live far more than taking someone else's money and going down the life path that the attached strings force me towards. "
It's incredibly rude of him to invite himself over.
"I get your point, and I agree that OP's dude is not unlikely to be using the concept to manipulate. 

But you are oversimplifying. Street smarts are definitely a thing. I agree however that it is not it's own form of intelligence. It is more an umbrella term for a lot of different skill sets that are often aquired from life experience and being ""in the streets"". 

Examples of social street smarts: Negotiation, manipulation, manouvering complex or risky social situations such as breaking the law or dealing with potentially malevolent people. 

It's also used for all sorts of non social skills, traits and understandings.... 

People can lack street smarts. And they can learn them. OP's development of street smarts have probably been set back by being with this dude. But at least she will be getting a retrospective crash-course in dealing with malicious people. "
Ooh that's bad. So either he's straight up in denial or he's got no pitch/hearing. 
"I know this is obvious, but basically tell him what you told us \- that you absolutely love .your husband, that you're as hurt and disturbed by this, and that this was completely out of left field. "
"I feel like Anna did us all a favor. Of course she could have handled it better, but I remember what it was like to be 16. I don't expect maturity from her. Had she said nothing, nobody would have thought that Jake needs therapy. I just suggested it to his parents and they're planning on making him going contingent on getting his tuition paid.

I don't know why do many people assume he was going to grow out of it on his own. Looking back, he's been working on this plan for 4 or 5 years. It creeps me out completely. I keep thinking about times I caught him looking at me and when I wore a bathing suit around him. He has stayed in my home so many times over the years. Did he go through my things? Is he the real reason I lose a ridiculous number of thongs in the wash? It's just disgusting."
"According to OP’s update, he confirmed everything the sister said. A 19 year old using his uncle to help him actively pursue his aunt is incredibly concerning, and it is wrong. He’s been basing his entire life on “stealing” his aunt, he need serious therapy."

"This would be a deal breaker for me.
I get attraction is attraction blah blah blah but I wouldn't divorce someone over 30 lbs or even threaten to.
It's shallow.
Shit happens. My SO had a knee injury and put on that much weight until they figured out how to modify their eating patterns.
We both put on around 14 lbs after our first kid but we were still in a healthy range.
Look for a partner who is committed to health not weight. 
Looks will always depreciate over time, you can't help it, but having partner were both your wellbeing comes first, that's what you need.

"I mean the guy did do something incredibly stupid so...I gotta agree with op on this. Who brings home a potentially dangerous untrained animal when you are about to have a baby in less than 2 months without so much as a phone call conversation with their SO, not a smart man."
"&gt; Not to be snarky but I seriously hope you are paying attention, because even cheating aside this is some A+ narcissistic behavior. What redeemable qualities does this guy actually have?

THANK YOU.

I hate to break it to OP like this, but she's the pit stop before he inevitably trades her in for a newer (read: younger) model, with all the textbook cruelty he's shown to his (still current) wife.

There's nothing about this guy that screams anything other than ""narcissistic jerk"", and the sooner OP realizes that, the better off she will be."

Why you think you can behave in a reasonable fashion with unreasonable people is ....kind of baffling.  You can't reason with crazy.    So why are you trying?  

You keep knuckling under and caving so what do you expect to be different?  The only solution is to completely cut them out of your life because they aren't going to change and you can't confront them without buckling. 

No contact is your only option.

He’s not ready for a relationship just walk away quietly
"&gt; she wouldn’t enjoy herself

She sounds extremely selfish and immature. We all do things we don’t want to do and go to places we may not want to to fulfill social obligations, it’s part of being an adult. This event isn’t about enjoying herself or not, it’s about supporting her partner at an important professional event. She can go out to “fun” social events with her friends any other night of the week. Your request was completely reasonable and the fact that she just shut you down is very concerning. This may mean you are incompatible for the long term, you are going to want a partner that supports you in your professional endeavours, and she is apparently unwilling to do that. She won’t put herself out one little bit to do something that is important to you. I don’t want to jump on the inevitable “break up!” train, but you should seriously re-examine this relationship."
"Have you actually told her how you feel? 

She's clearly not planning on cheating. Thats why she has done nothing without your permission. It's okay to feel hurt, but you need to remember that it's neither her fault or responsibility. "
[deleted]
"You say mild disagreements find a way to turn into fights almost daily. Why do you think this escalates? Is it due to her being annoyed at what you do/say or you being annoyed at what she does/says. I (30M auti) have learned that it is almost always best to let the small annoyances fly unless they repeat themselves frequently. The stress and unhappiness you get by focusing on these minor issues can have a huge impact on the general feel of the relationship. And even when I find that I really need to address them I try make a coherent story (on paper) of why I find these annoying and what I suggest we do to improve on them.
However I've also been in the situation where my SO constantly felt the need to blow her annoyances with me up to epic proportions. It is already super stressful for me to fit in try to be as normal as possible. The mere thought that whatever I did could have resulted in a fight was enough for me to become void of initiative to the point where I actively tried to avoid contact and only did things together that were risk free. Which has led to the end of my last relationship."
"This. Even if he could manage dealing with her incredible indecisiveness, parenting with this woman would be a living hell. Parenting between two relatively mentally healthy parents is hard enough. But with a mother who spends 30 minutes in therapy over picking a dinner? No."

Great way to put it, made me laugh! ;)"
"OK. Start by *not* responding to someone telling you something you don't want to hear.

Instead of making it about you, make it about them. Hear what they say, try to get clarity about what they're saying, and then go take it away to think about it.

Can you do that?"
"Eeehh... with y'all's age, sitting on laps is pretty creepy. I can kind of understand holding hands, but sitting on laps..."
This is ridiculous. Your girlfriend may have anxiety and depression but that's no excuse for the way she treats you. You've done absolutely nothing wrong. Does she pull controlling shit like this regularly?
"You need to give her more orgasms.  In two years, coming a few times is just not enough, particularly since you get to come every single time.  If you start giving her orgasms on a more regular basis, she’ll enjoy sexy time with you more.

If she’s fully aroused, she may be more receptive to piv.  If she’s not, it’s going to be uncomfortable and unpleasant for her."
"First of all, you made the right decision.  Being in limbo would have eaten at you and there's someone out there who will be HAPPY to be in a real relationship with you.  

I was in a similar situation except it was the mirror image, 14 years ago.  All we had were official dates and we never progressed to spending unstructured time together.  I wanted unstructured time just bumming around doing daily life so badly I could taste it.  I never got it with him.  And it was the same thing underneath--he didn't really want a real relationship with me.  

Three months later I met the right guy and it was effortless and natural from day one.  YOU WILL TOO but you have to be single in order to be available to meet the right one.  "
"He supplied the alcohol to her, if she's an American."
"I'm really sorry for your loss. That said, I don't think asking his mom for any of his stuff is the right thing to do right now. Stuff is just stuff, and you have a few of his items already. Your memories are yours and will exist forever even without any stuff. I just feel like the request could upset his mom, who is dealing with a lot right now too."
"It's like when you're trying to get rid of something on craigslist, you'll get more reliable people if you say it costs $20 than if you give it away for free.  "
"#**NO!**

You are not at fault here. She cheated, plain and simple. Instead of working with you to address the lack of sex, she cheated.

So, what do you do going forward. Learn from this and apply it to your next relationship. Now you know that sex and intimacy are important. Apply that knowledge."
"1. Please don't use ""sexy times"" , just use "" having sex""  or "" be intimate""....

2. She wasn't communicating her needs, that's not your fault.

3. Cheating is always a d!ck (r/relationships doesn't allow "" bad words"" …..) move, her fault as well.

4. Not manning up is your fault. ""doing things FOR her, like cooking every day, buying groceries, making breakfast, doing a ton of house work etc.""  Those things, and the constant excuses and self-doubting you do, not even mentioning forgiving her for literally cheating on you and then thinking it was your fault, are all signs of a lack of self-respect. Try to work on that.


5. You're still young and obviously (not for you but for the rest) someone better will come along in the future, relax."
You can’t stay. Leave him. Go no contact. Do not look back.
"Wishful thinking there buddy. She'll break up with you before you get any money back. 

End it with your dignity intact at least. "
"People are giving you really deranged, judgmental advice here.

The real problem is that your boyfriend dug deep into every nook and cranny of your phone to spy on you. He doesn't respect you or your boundaries, and that is magnified by the fact that he's 'hurt' that you won't do sex things you aren't comfortable with with him, just because you've done them before.

You can always say no. Even if you did something with the same person and don't want to do it anymore, you can say no. Someone who spies on you and acts like a baby about the fact that you existed as a sexual being before you met him is not worth your time."
"Break up. And for the love of god wait a couple of weeks before you pursue this ""soulmate"". "
"No. We don't think you're stupid at all. Young, yes, but not stupid. These guys always start out super nice and charming. Then they do something like yell at you, or call you a name, and suffer no consequences. Then the next time they say or do something a little worse, again with no consequences. Over the last 1.5 years, he has slowly escalated this kind of behavior to what happened this time. Next time, and there WILL be a next time, it will be worse. He'll be sorry. He'll apologize. He'll tell you that it's only because he loves you so much that he behaves that way. It's all lies. He wants to keep you around so he can have a punching bag. You deserve better. Leave him now, before he starts hitting you, because that IS coming.

"I agree with this.  I personally have my Facebook set so I have to manually approve every post that folks try to put on my timeline.  It's not because I don't care about their lives, but rather because I don't necessarily want everyone I'm Facebook friends with (which includes some coworkers) to see every aspect of my and my friends' lives - it can be nice to keep some things private.  If OP's BF has work people as friends, it makes sense that he may not want them to see very personal parts of his life."

"Girlfriend is that way. We tend to associate with people who have similar values, and can provide a support network from a place of mutual reality. I don't find it hard to believe at all. The world is full of people who are nuttier than squirrel poo. "
"That sounds like a 'you' problem. Not a him problem. You don't want him to show casual, physical affection to a long term best friend? That's weird and inappropriate.

If you don't feel comfortable with it, ask yourself why you need to control the way he shiws affection when it is (based on what you described) completely appropriate"
"You’re absolutely not wrong to feel how you do, he was absolutely trying to manipulate you with that email and this whole situation is beyond bizarre and unhealthy. Why was he so obsessed with naming the baby after his sister who is still alive and also has her own baby with a similar name? What was his reasoning for sending out an email with a name that you had not agreed upon while you were in fucking surgery?! Has he apologised and acknowledged how wrong he was? 

Good for you for standing up for yourself and letting him deal with the fall out from his own idiotic behaviour. If you ever cop any grief from his family about the name or they ask you about it I would be straight up honest and blunt and say “Jeff and I agreed on a list of names before Baby was born, Carolyn Rose was never on it. For some reason while I was still in surgery experiencing complications from the birth, he chose to send out an email to you all stating that we were leaning towards that name. I have no idea why he did that so, you’ll have to ask him!”  You don’t owe it to him to hedge or lie or protect him from embrassament about this utterly asshole and deliberately manipulative move when you were at your most vulnerable. 

If you are still angry and feel you cannot trust him fully (and I’d so I’m not surprised!) I would suggest a few sessions of couples therapy. You need to ensure there won’t be a pattern here of him attempting major life decisions for you and your child unilaterally. Also if the name thing was because of family pressure, he needs to cut the apron strings and establish boundaries stat! "
"I feel like both of the parents are the toxic people in this situation, though."
"All these ""none-of-your-business"" comments never care to explain why exactly not. And what should I have answered her? Ah, the house! The one we sacrificed! The very one no other family member but my father has a single clue about!"

"Did you ever discuss your expectations with her when you started living together? Just because you work more doesn't automatically mean she should be doing all the chores\- that's something you assumed. I work less than my bf and we split chores equally because the way I see it, we'd each be doing all our own chores if we lived alone or with a roommate. If she's not even doing 50&amp;#37; of the work then that's another story "
"&gt; Have you asked her how she feels about you making decisions?

A few times. She likes it when the pressure is off. If I make those decisions, she's happy. She doesn't need to think about dinner or worry about sex, then she's calmer. If I am to put her in a position where she has to make the move, she gets nervous and sweaty and then her getting sweaty makes her more nervous which makes her sweat more. She'll seriously sweat through sheets which ruins it for her. 

This way, she just kind of happily goes along with things. Every time I ask if she likes that I just take charge, she affirms so. "
"&gt;Sometimes I feel like my boyfriend cares more about Aaron than he does me. I know that sounds pathetic and immature 

Please start trusting your instincts and your own powers of observation! You boyfriend absolutely cares more about Aaron than about you.

What was your boyfriend’s romantic history before you came along? My guess: Little experience with women. So he’s intimidated by Aaron’s self-professed sexual prowess. Having a live-in girlfriend is tangible proof that he also has sex on the regular. He keeps you around to reassure his man-crush that he’s a virile, manly man.

I would stop discussing the matter with him and simply start detaching until you can move out."
Could you send him postcards or little trinkets? Just for him? Snail mail is old fashioned but may be something special between the two of you.

"Since there’s a lot of conflicting info in these comments: If a guest has a SO they 1. are living with or 2. have been with seriously for over a year, the SO is invited as well (by name, not just as an anonymous plus one). If you don’t invite the SO, it’s rude. End of story. The only exception would be if there were some SERIOUS reason that SO shouldn’t be at the wedding (raging alcoholic, house arrest, etc.).

OP, your friend was very rude. Especially as you’ve been with your SO for four years. Unless you’ve been super on and off or are in a casual open relationship or something? Or does the bride have an issue with him?

If none of that applies, you are 100 percent justified in not going if you don’t want to without feeling guilty. Especially if it’s already a financial burden for you! If you still want to go, I’d reach out and gently ask “hey, I noticed my invite said +0 and wanted to confirm SO wasn’t supposed to be invited?” 

If she says no and you decide to go anyway, don’t tell her you’re mad. Put that aside, accept she just made a big faux pas, and celebrate anyway. You shouldn’t go to a wedding with a grudge so let it go.

If you decide not to go, which is totally justified, don’t tell her you’re mad when you RSVP no. *BUT* if she asks you why you’re not going, say something gentle but clear like “I was disappointed to see SO wasn’t invited since I have limited vacation time, so we really have to spend those days off together.”

"&gt;am I crazy for wanting to spend more time with him?

No. Of course not. That being said \- 2 hours is a *commitment*. I lived 1.5 hours from my BF for 3.5 years and would only visit maybe every 2\-3 weekends. Both of us were really busy with school and life, so some weekends, we'd both be ""pooped"" and needed to catch up on other commitments. 

I see why you'd be miffed. He's expending energy on another woman, who he has slept with, instead of you *but* it doesn't sound like he's picked doing this over seeing you. It sounds like he wants to chill at his own place without hosting you and reading this thesis is taking up his time while he does that. 

&gt;Long distance relationships are difficult.

Yup. They are. But if you keep the lines of communication open and you are committed to making it work \- it pays off big time. "

Imagine the reverse scenario. You find out an old friend from across the country is in town, and you make last-minute plans to see them.

"I've dated someone so extremely similar that I almost asked you if his name is [name].  But then I realized he'd be a little older than your guys now, and that he'd definitely never been in an eight year relationship.

I'm not exaggerating - from all your small points about being commitment-minded, into social justice, good relations with friends and family, never antagonistic towards me, selfish in bed, not really interested in anything about me.  (Though I will say the ""good relationships"" and ""social justice"" parts about him turned out to be really surface level - very superficially so on both counts).

Anyway, there was one time we were walking back to his place from the grocery store and stopped at a stop light/crosswalk for our turn.  The car that pulled up as the light turned red stopped a couple of inches into the crosswalk area, and hit the hood of their car with his hand and started yelling at him.  Or the time we were walking downtown to the train after grabbing some drinks with friends, and there was a group of a couple of dozen people protesting something across the street.  He wanted to cross the street so he could walk by them and give them a piece of his mind.  Or the time he picked up food at a fast food place, got home, ate half of one of the dollar sandwiches and decided it wasn't made fresh because it wasn't warm, so he drove back and demanded another.  He was just super antagonistic in needless ways, even with some of his ""projects"" (I'd explain that but I think it'd be too identifying).  He loved pushing buttons for the sake of it.

He complained the same way about work shit (basically constantly complaining about how dumb everyone else is and nobody recognizes he's the best, or whatever), so much so that I had to make it a rule that he was not allowed to talk to me about work when I was at work.  The constant complaining and negativity was bringing me down all the time.

He was just incredibly embarrassing to be around.  To the point that I stopped hanging around my friends with him.  I also overheard him say something stereotypically racist once to someone else (he didn't know I heard him), which caused me to be too ashamed of him to go hang out with my best friend doing her yearly visit to the states for fear that he'd say something similar in front of her.  

Shortly after that I had a revelation asking myself wtf I was doing with such a person, let alone someone that is so embarrassing to me.  Broke up with him shortly after.  I couldn't find a way to put up with it, *or* get through to him.  He was set in his ways.  And I dated him for way longer than I should have, in hindsight - probably 9 or 10 months.

Like I said, he never exhibited these behaviors *at me*.  Well, until after we broke up.  Oof.  One of the few exes I've had to block. 

I wouldn't put up with this shit again.  And discussing it never did any good.

(Sorry, that was a lot longer than I intended it to be.)"
"I think it's one of those issues that's right on the red flag line - it's definitely uncomfortable and it sounds like he spends an, um, excessive amount of time on this.  And I'm worried it's crossed lines.  You're not wrong that it's definitely got potential to become a massive issue.  

There is also a massive issue with 14-year-olds being ""possibly"" attractive (that means he does, indeed, find them hot)."
Gotta love the Reddit medical diagnosis
Yeah her dad teaching her to cook would be a good bonding experience.
It's not about you or anything you did wrong. Some people just have low moral standards for themselves and cheat rather than breaking up. 
"You need to go to therapy dude. If you need this desperately to feel bigger and more powerful than people who are in pain, you need psychological help. Sorry, but if people find out they're likely to think you're an asshole because you're an asshole. "
"""Hey honey, I just happened to see you had a text from a Chinese phone number. What is that?""

Doesn't have to automatically mean anything horrible, you're curious and you didn't snoop on his phone from how you describe it. 

&gt; he normally likes eating my food but lately he's been chewing a little and then saying, 'this is gross'

Also, rude. Maybe he can cook his own food. "
"He if agreed to end his tenancy on a set day and you have proof, you change the locks after that day. And get him off the lease with the owner's permission."
"I’m beyond confused. If you both hate kids WHY did you have unprotected sex. Now you have a child in this world with two idiot parents who don’t even care about him/her. This is ridiculous and just stupid. For you to even say you hate a baby is just flat out sick. You deserve to be treated he way they are treating you. You were the dumbass that didn’t wear a condom and now you’re saying you hate the baby and acting like it’s the babies fault your life is ruined. YOU did this! This is a result of your incompetence. Jesus Christ what’s wrong with you?! I mean seriously, repeatedly saying that you hate a baby. I don’t feel bad at all. You deserve this. That baby deserves a loving family who will take care of them, thank god you two idiots aren’t having to do it. "
"I talk about my exes every-so-often, probably more than average. I do it because I’m wholly and fully over them, I don’t feel sad, I don’t wish anything had been any different (even though some of those relationships weren’t happy and/or ended badly). But if I’m telling a story about a time in my past, I don’t shy away from the fact that X-person said whatever, or X-person liked Y thing. 

Maybe she feels the same, that her exes are no more special or significant than any other friends in her past.

Or maybe she’s trying to make you jealous, or trying to prove a point, or is still heartbroken or insecure about past relationships... you know what her motivations are most likely to be."
"Yeah, it's pretty messed up to always tell people who want to have kids that ""you'll see"" hahaha. I get it, if I'm judging you, that is absolutely called for. If I'm saying, ""Oh hey, I'd like to have my kids play an instrument of their choice when they get school age, because I think it helps their brains develop,"" don't laugh at me and say ""OH you'll see!"" Like really? I get it, some people love to be condescending, but really people? Everyone has hopes and dreams for when they parent, and telling people what they will want to do after they have kids is so damned rude and condescening. Maybe they wil change their minds, maybe they won't, but you don't have to spread your misery everywhere. I absolutely get you, u/SausageSandwich87.

"I know all relationships are different but my husband is my best friend and we spend time together joking and laughing and hanging out and our sex life over the years has only gotten better. 

I think seeing a therapist to help you figure out why you feel this way would be beneficial even if you *don’t* stay married to her."

"Depending on how you met \(online?bar?\) tbh this sort of information should be divulged prior to even going on dates. If I was looking for a proper relationship i'd be pretty pissed if i wasted 3 dates on someone who had no intention of ever doing that. 

There are definitely nice ways to do it, I was not looking for anything serious for about 6 years of my dating life, and told everyone as such when they initiated their interest/we met... but yea... early. next time... way earlier IMO. "
"Fuck that. Anyone who is hurting needs someone to talk to other than the person who hurt them, and for a lot of people, that's family. Also, they will be able to offer him a perspective somewhat removed from his complete involvement. Knowing the basic character of the people sharing the lives of your loved ones is a natural desire, and, I think, a beneficial arrangement for close-knit families. P.S. People finding out that you're a cheater is the price you pay for being a cheater. And dealing with the negativity and judgment of your family  (to a reasonable degree) is the price you pay for giving a cheater a second chance. Everything costs something. Do what you want, and pay for it."
Please don't call this a drunken threesome.  You are just masking what it really was.
"This is a good angle that your mother can bring to Jared \- the #metoo spotlight on the Jimmy Williams articles in the Chronicle and the New York Times is causing a lot of talk about other trainers and people are starting to name names. The fact that this guy's behavior was so outrageous means that it is only a matter of time before he does the same to Jared's and your mother's clients. That WILL get out and WILL ruin everyone's reputation. Also, I bet there are already whispers about this guy. There are few secrets in the horse world."
"He knew that his pregnant wife was in the hospital having a consult with doctors about whether they’ll have to deliver the child early or admit her to the hospital for the remainder of the pregnancy. 

What other information does he need, exactly? 

And it’s not like he skipped that meeting to attend some crucial work function. He went home and DRANK A BEER. "
"Yep, the second she starts looking for jobs and can list herself as being bilingual (or more, considering OP said she was also taking French and German in school), her value as an employee is going to be much higher than others without multiple languages. "
"This. Maybe men should grow the fuck up instead of expecting women to always be older, wiser, more caring, more considerate, more independent and more capable than them?"
"I'd do the same.  


If you fee awkward about running into him, if he apologizes or tried to explain just say ""Hey, no worries \- just not my style.  See ya around.""  


No shame at all in telling him that his style is fine \(ehhhh, even if it's not\) but it's just not a match.  Could be other girls out there who like his style."
You’ve only been with her for a year and a half. Her true colors are starting to show now. You might want to reconsider marrying this person. 
Mature adults don't need to be told how to be emotionally supportive. Emotional intelligence is a basic human skill that he should have by age 26. 
At least he didn’t find the video of you doing it!
Do people consider leggings and vans to be dressing up?
"I'm sorry and i know that this is not the  normal situation and im not implying it should be, but as the wife who swings with her husband i do NOT understand this intense,  insane level of jealousy. It's so fucking beyond me. Do you trust your partner at *all*!? You know just because you sleep in the same bed as someone it doesn't mean their penis is just going to slip into their vagina, right!? 

Like i said i don't expect everyone to have my level of understanding but this sub agrees that kicking a house guest out at midnight to get a hotel because the mattress deflated is absolute insanity, right? "
"I was in the same situation as you, but my mum eventually found freedom after 16 years. I was 26 by then. A big part that did it was my mum's mum dying, so the shame of divorce wasn't so shameful, though my mum's dad is still unaware. Another big part was helping my mum get a job and start driving herself again, which broke my mum out of her ""helpless woman"" mindset. Finally, my mum needed some therapy to reflect, which stopped her using me as a counsellor. My mum is well off with her own money (thanks to the divorce -- my dad's mistress was an expensive hobby), goes dancing with other old ladies now, and gets hit on by men 20 years her junior. It's finally OK. I'm finally OK with loads of therapy. "
"That's horrible. He sounds awful. He's lied and cheated (a break just to sleep with someone else is no break.) Then he got back together and didn't tell You? Friend, if there is any time you can lose your shit it's now. Just never listen to him, he doesn't care. He's garbage, and you'll be so much happier alone or with someone who has integrity. So sorry you're going through this. "
"I feel for you. I do agree with everyone here saying that he probably needs to be told you expect him to be there. But I can see why you'd feel resentful that you take the initiative to do things like be there for him when he is sick and he needs to be told to do this. I would feel resentful about this too. I feel like we see this a lot here... the man needs to be actively 'told' what to do before it occurs to him to do it, and while he may then happily do it, that still leaves the woman doing the majority of the emotional labour. "
You’re 30 with a 20 year old girlfriend obsessing over boobs like a teenager..get help
"It wasn't even passive aggressive... reading that answer (I'm female by the way) in a vacuum I just read it as 'really it doesn't matter if you come or not, my moms here anyway so it's fine, but if you decide to go home, please do this chore for me before I get home'."
"That’s what a manipulator does. He sees your weaknesses, knows what you care about and chooses to promise you those things, with no real intentions of doing them. What he gets out of it is sex I’m sorry to say. He found someone who he felt was easy to manipulate because you allowed him to keep coming back into your life even after he treated you so poorly. I’m so sorry that you went through that, but hopefully now you have a better picture and have the strength to just remove this person from your life. "
"The bulge in his pants was relevant because my boyfriend brought that up to me that he saw it, and because he said I was lying later on when I said I didn't like it. I didn't even bring up jacobs penis, marco did. "
"Would that have helped, really? Even if she didn't see it at the party, Marcos still would have brought it up because he's insecure about his own size.

OP, his insecurities are yours to cushion, not fix, and so long as he's insecure, he'll find ways to bring up conversations where nothing you say is the right thing to say."
I just texted him after talking with friends about it. Sent him a screen shot of Tim’s DMs and asked what was up. I’ll keep everyone updated
"Hahahahahahahahaahahhahshahahaahahhaahahahaha

The fuck man. My mom was a teacher. The teachers in my state just went on strike over their pathetic salary (which was significantly lower than the state median income). 

For how many hours teachers really put in they really are paid shit. And a lot of them, especially elementary school, spend boatloads of their own money on decorations (can you imagine a first grade  classroom with  no decorations? It would be so depressing) and supplies and supplementary learning material like books and workbooks and such. 

And beyond that teaching is fucking hard. You have to deal with shitty helicopter parents and entitled football players and teenager drama while being outnumbered 25 to 1 (or more) by a bunch of horny rebellious 17 year olds. And somehow you have to teach them calculus in there somewhere. Or get them to read Hamlet.

Or, even worse, you're wrangling 25 seven year olds who occasionally have bathroom related accidents and are somehow always, ALWAYS, sticky and you have that one little shit who bites the other kids and the other little shit who keeps climbing the monkey bars to jump off because they think they can fly (yeah that one was me) and you've got a third kid that shows up with bruises every other week and despite CPS calls nothing is getting better for them at home. 

And through all of it you know that the future of the world is in these brats' hands and since these brats are in YOUR hands that's a pretty heavy responsibility. 

So yeah. "
"She shouldn't have to tell her husband that she wants him there when she could be hurt, the baby could die, or in general at all when the hospital or especially the baby is concerned. 

Communication important? Yes.
Is that the issue here? No.

If you must be told to do your job, you are not doing well. Whether in work or relationships. And his job is to support and care for his partner and to be concerned when things are even a little wrong, let alone so dangerous and frightening.

 If you have to ask your partner to care for you or be compassionate, or to be PRESENT at all, the standard that falls short is not communication 

And It Is Not Her Fault"
"To answer the question in your header, no you should not let it go. She was outrageously rude and you won't be doing her any favors if there are no consequences for it. Sure, you can ask her why she hates hearing it but she needs to get the message that the world does not revolve around her and she is not entitled to throw a fit like a screaming toddler at the age of 17. "
"This sub is so weird... if it was from his perspective, mid 30s guy pursuing a 22 year old who looks 17, this sub would come down on him like a ton of bricks about how creepy he is and how he should date people his own age, how he is likely only pursuing a younger woman so he can control her, etc, especially if the lady in question is so shy and inexperienced as OP.

Yet here is everyone telling OP to go for it... why? The age difference and experience difference make it more likely than not a really bad idea. OP needs to gain confidence, not to approach this guy but how to navigate the dating world as an adult, set boundaries, not fall for manipulation, etc.

In this case it sounds like he is just being polite and OP has a crush that is getting out of hand."
"They will need this skill when they go to Kindergarten, did they not go to preschool, every preschool teaches kids to clean up, I mean there's a damn song about it, ""clean up, clean up, everybody, everyday!!!!, Google it, show it to the kids, do it together!

I agree, there's a bigger issue at hand, good luck with working in that, it sounds like she's stuck in her way or no way. You need to be the one to work on communicating or suggesting counseling. "
"The way he's reacting, he thinks of other girls himself when he does and he's projecting that on OP."
"It's all about recontextualizing the relationship dynamic. Not knowing you, there are a few ways to do it. Which is easiest/most palatable to you is up to you:

1. They are too good and that's okay. There's a lot of reasons why a guy would ""date down"". Think of it this way, since you're a sci-fi writer: the sharpest sword in the land is useless to the untrained archer. Maybe those guys are bows in search of the arrow that fits them just right. Maybe you don't think you fly the truest, or look the nicest, but if the bowstring fits the nock perfectly, none of that other shit matters.

2. You are better than you think you are. You...seem to have trouble with this one. I'll let your therapist work with you here.

3. They are worse than you think they are. Everybody has flaws. Some flaws are more immediately apparent than others, but they're there. Don't judge these books by their covers. They are trying to present their absolute best version to you, just as you are trying to do to them. Just keep reminding yourself that they are flawed, just like you.

Maybe some of that will help. Maybe it won't. Some may be turned off by your personality. Some may reject you. If you're not okay with being rejected, you may not be ready to date. Rejection happens. It's not the end of the book, it's just a break until the next part is ready to be written."
"Do you realize that if your GF didn't pay for the mobile groomer the dogs would stink and you'd be writing into complain about that and everyone would agree that she's a terrible pet owner? Btw the ""horror stories"" are real, particularly about PetCo? Its groomers are constantly murdering dogs. I'd be afraid to use any of the big box groomers.

If she didn't pay for a dog walker you'd probably be coming home to urine and poop and crazy dogs full of pent-up energy.

Your girlfriend is by and large being a responsible owner. I don't cook for my dogs, but plenty of people do nowadays. As for her not cooking for the two of you -- do you? It sounds like you both work. You don't think it's her job to provide you with hot meals, do you?"
Are you guys in premarital counselling because it sounds like there are a lot of issues that marriage is only going to make worse?
"I'm not saying ""Oh he's gay, so she can fuck him and it's still not cheating!""  Obviously there's a line somewhere, and it kind of depends on the individual relationship where that line is.

If it's too much for OP, it's too much.  Fine.  There's his boundary.  But my point was that many times women are very open with their gay, male bffs and it doesn't mean anything and it's not inappropriate in many situations."
"&gt; The joke was immature. 

To whom? 

I'd feel pretty sick if I thought I was pregnant....because I don't fucking want to be pregnant. "
"&gt; I'm waiting for a job so I can finally move out, but there's nothing really on the market right now unfortunately.

Then while you wait you get a job that's available and pays. You get two part time jobs if needed. Save every penny you can and pick up some frugal tips. Find rooms on craiglist that don't require deposits or first/last. You need to move out. "
"I am wondering if the ""illness"" is that Nicole has a substance or prescription addiction?"
"Whenever people say ""it's just a word"" I challenge them to go up to their boss and call them the C word and then see how little impact words can have. Funnily enough no one takes me up on it, go figure maybe words do have power."
I'm glad you commented. I thought I must have been the only person in the world to react to infidelity like this. Thank you.
The fact that she can and will apologize to OP but not her sisters' is also something that needs to change. 
I don't believe this is real. 
Seems like OP is selfish and enjoys the attention she gets from Instagram and this dude and other dudes. Inflated self worth and narcissistic as heck. The people that she's dated before deserve *so* much better than OP.

"Having the means doesn't mean she should keep the baby.  Having a child isn't about the money.  It's about what you want out of life and if a baby doesn't figure into that then she should terminate or adopt out (and not to her friend).  This is her body and her choice regardless of why.  She is obviously a self supporting, intelligent woman who happened to have an oopsie (which many women do regardless of economics/education/social status) and that oopsie should not adversely effect her (or any woman's) life.  I have no desire to get into a pro choice or anti abortion or adoption discussion and I respect people's beliefs.  Yet, what works for one person doesn't necessarily for another.  In the end, having or not having a baby (keeping, abortion or adoption) has life long repercussions and she needs to weigh those for herself.  

As to your friend, I agree that you should speak to her about your feelings in regards to her wanting to adopt.   She has intense feelings as well and having a baby is super important to her.  I would think regardless of your choice (keeping, terminating or adopting to someone else) that she is going to feel a great deal of negativity and likely more that is going to seriously effect your relationship.  She may see this as a betrayal of a gift that you could have easily given to her and choose not to.  If possible, perhaps suggest therapy to her (and yourself depending on your choice) and perhaps you could help her research adoption centers.

Good luck."
The crucial point though is this woman has the financial means to adopt another baby. She could also foster. She could do ivf. She could choose to stop wasting her time on men who don't want kids. She could have had kids earlier. She isn't infertile and struggling. 
I'm sorry for this but are you sure she aborted YOUR baby?
"Ok well Being Russian in the US right now I'm sure has some tricky parts depending on how stupid your friends are.

She's a teenager, a first generation immigrant, from a country that if you read that sort of thing has a hand in screwing with your government.

My in-laws went through the same thing, Polish and Italian, both dropped their native language asap.

You shouldn't drop it - I'm sure shes being teased or whatever.  You should have a look on some national job boards searching for the criteria that the applicant must be fluent in English and Russian - Show her how much she has to gain by retaining her heritage and adopting her new home as opposed to simply leaving one behind."

"Don't try debating the Bible like this with a very religious person until you've consulted someone who is truly knowledgeable on the subject. 


Finding single verses that agree with you from the Bible are great. It's also a book that is a compilation of a multitude of writers over the span of a thousand years. For every verse telling you one message, you can almost always find another that directly contradicts it. 


So speak to someone (like someone that actually works in the church) that is probably well aware of this dynamic and can foresee any other quotes your brother may go to. Because if you try this method without consulting someone, that's probably what will happen, and it will only make him more sure that his way of living is just."

"Dude, you're the one who sounds crazy. I love animals and work in the pet industry, and I still hate it when other peoples' cats get into my yard and kill the native wildlife. My own cat is only allowed in the yard (she can't jump the fence. She's too old) and I get irrationally pissed off when te neighbors' cats jump the fence and attack her. Why the hell should I have to set up a motion activated sprinkler just to keep *other people's pets* out of MY yard? 

And yes, it is illegal in many places to let your cats roam. And is perfectly legal to catch ten and send them to the pound. If people don't want their cats to end up at the pound, don't let them roam around killing wildlife."
"&gt;My sister wants to go back to school to get a 2-year nursing so that she can support herself and her daughter, as she has never been to college and has only work experience as a vet tec

That ain't going to take 2 years, that's probably going to take her 4-5 years if she's never been to college before. She needs to take *prerequisite classes* in order to even apply to nursing programs, in addition to taking a standardized TEAS test that will test her on chemistry, biology, microbiology, math, English, reading, etc. Those prerequsite classes (which include chemistry, anatomy, physiology, a math class, an English class, psychology, anthropology/sociology, microbiology, and some other stuff I don't remember) can take 2-3 years for her to fulfill depending on how hard she is willing to study. Once she fulfills those course requirements. *then* she can apply to a 2-yr nursing program if she is lucky enough to get into one.

So you're really looking at 4-5 more years of supporting her before she can get a nursing degree.

Nope the fuck out of that.

If she thinks it will only take her 2 years to get a nursing degree then she hasn't done her homework on it and she is moreso daydreaming than actually serious about it. "
"If he is spitting on you, that is physical abise. In many states that is assault.

"I'm just going to throw this out there, but if they are dead set on helping people, and they are coming back to the states, it's not like they can't find poor people in America to help. Seriously, I am super glad they feel the need to do good in this world, and I am glad they are actually skilled physicians helping others, because a lot of these ""mission trips"" are glorified tourism. 

That being said, it grinds my gears that so many people think all the aid outside of America is fine, via charity and all that, but dagdabit, why don't these poor Americans get off their asses and do something for themselves! I'm not saying that's their thought process, but let's be real: A lot of us who grew up in churches and such always saw dentists and doctors going off to Latin America, Africa, SE Asia and so on, to volunteer time and services, but there are plenty of people stateside who have crap care, if any at all. It's not like we're a nation with national health care or anything like that. So what I'm saying is, I'm sure they could find a mission or charity that operates in the US, say in the inner city, a Native American reservation, Appalachia...all places struck by poverty, and help out there in exchange for a small stipend and an apartment.  In fact, there are programs for medical professional to go to certain Native American reservations, and have their housing provided for them, and student loans paid back, all of that good stuff. It's not like there are not plenty of people here that desperately need care.

It's great that they feel this calling to go to Africa and help, I'm not knocking that at all. What I *am* taking issue with is that I have known missionaries who don't expect their families to fund their ""off"" time. Nurses, engineers, and teachers, who figure out how to live for a year or two in another place, and then get back on their feet when they are in the states. 

They want to homeschool their kids? That's fine, but it's their perogative to make that work, not just let mommy and daddy take care of them for months and months at a time.  Otherwise, their kids can go to a public school OR they can even ask some local Christian schools if there is a discout or something. A lot of those schools offer discounts to kids in pastoral families.

These are adults, not kids going off on some feel good mission trip. They are responsible for the ins and outs of the operation, and making it work when they are overseas AND when they are back home in the states. They don't get to just act like teenagers and let mommy and daddy take care of everything while they play teacher downstairs with their kids."

"Might as well just slide that ring onto your own finger because it seems like that's who you bought it for. It is precisely because an engagement ring is so special and important that it's probably the worst time to default to what ""most women"" would want. *Especially* when it involves morals/principles your girlfriend clearly adheres to very strongly. What this says to her is you either don't know her as well as she thought you did, you don't take her and her values seriously, or you just didn't put much thought into what is a pretty big deal (spending a lot of money doesn't necessarily mean putting a lot of thought into it in this case). Or a combination of all three of those things. "
Everything I read in the op was ridiculous and petty.
"When I posted this here I thought it wasn't a common situation at all!!! It's so weird...

Do you feel like you missed out on your brother's wedding by not attending it? (If this isn't an invasive question)"
"I feel like your interpretation of the comment you’re replying to is really uncharitable.

Being asked to “make a meal” could mean that his wife was hungry, it wasn’t near a normal mealtime, and she wasn’t feeling up to cooking for herself.

Being asked to “do chores” doesn’t necessarily mean being asked to do *any chores at all*, it could also mean doing a chore that she normally does, but doesn’t feel well enough to do that day.

And no matter how much they may love someone, not everyone has the emotional intelligence or is perceptive enough to anticipate other people’s emotional needs, which is why communication is so important. It’s awesome that you and your partner are able to work with each other so well without needing much in the way of direct communication, but I don’t think it’s fair to expect everyone to be able to do the same."
"I dealt with some similar issues at that age. Your advice would have alienated my parents from me, probably irreversibly. Every kid is different, so mileage may vary, but I think most of your post is bad advice. While I recognize that you mean well, these actions are more about assuaging the fears of the parent than it is about helping the child. 

&gt;1. Take away any and all computer access. Completely. If she's ever home alone, I would take the computer power supply and the router with me. I think you guys are wildly underreacting with supervised internet access. Not because she should be 'punished,' but because she needs to understand how serious this is.

This is a punishment for a child who loves computers and has difficulty making friends. It doesn't matter how much you insist it isn't. It will make her bitterly unhappy and reinforce the idea that she can't tell mom about her life without mom flipping out. 

&gt;2. Find her some friends she can connect with who are her age. Having no real\-life friends at her age is a HUGE problem with far\-reaching consequences. PERSIST UNTIL YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

Oh my lord, no. You cannot ""find friends"" for a child. Any attempt by the parent is doomed to fail; friendship cannot be forced, and the child will be that weird kid whose parent is overly involved in their social life. Both the child and their peers will resent it. The best you can do is *encourage*, not force, the child to participate in activities that will let them meet kids their own age. 

&gt;4. She is trying to push you away and will continue to try to push you away. She will do this over and over anytime an issue arises that requires her to navigate things that are painful to her. You need to push past it. Don't let her brush you off. She needs to understand that you care too much to let it go. The more she pushes you away, the more she's hurting inside. If you press the issue, she will still be hurting, but she knows she has your support. If you leave her alone, she hurts alone. Be with her even if she refuses to talk or look at you.

I cringed reading this. Children need space and privacy, both to develop and to heal. Becoming a compulsive helicopter parent will stifle her growth and further reinforce the idea that she can't tell parents anything. I can think of few thing that would have hurt me more than this. It's cruel to strip an introverted child of their privacy and solitude. 

&gt;5. She NEEDS to understand the dangers in trusting people online and learn to keep herself safe in life. She needs to learn and hear and be reminded over and over.

This will come across as berating her. 

OP's sister is a little girl who needs a conversation about the perils of the internet, not a permanent parental police state to smother her. She is not at fault for what happened and shouldn't be made a prisoner in her own home. "
"Then a no now is the correct answer. Dont give a reason, it is just not going to work out, sorry. If someone pester me more after that, I say it is personal, if they pester after I say it is personal they are not my friend and this will for sure not be a problem."
"I like to play it as well (I'm 23)! I mostly said that because of his behaviour towards an 8 year old like calling her his GF, I don't want it to sound like I'm calling every adult who plays it a pedophile so I'm sorry if I came across that way!"
"Refusing to use a condom is absolutely a red flag. Your preference doesn't outweigh her safety. And honestly, you should learn to love condoms. They are a cheap anti kid, anti STD anti drama tool.

There are some examples of couples who married at age 16 after knowing each other a week who have had long and happy marriages. That doesn't make it a good idea.
"no one hates adoption. you're not seeing or speaking to the actual problems in their relationship:

- he's a creep who preyed on a teenager,

- is pressuring her to have kids at the age of **21**, which, even if she wasn't a ballerina, *what the fuck*,

- is creepily focused on her retaining her ballerina physique after having ""tons of kids""

So the adoption advice is sort of out of left field and missing the point."
"I don't think I understand what the big deal is here. YOU don't have to call her Grandma, the kid's life isn't going to be made difficult by calling her Grandma. If your Uncle marries a woman that woman is your Aunt, whether or not they've raised nieces and nephews before."
"I don't get why you're so nonchalant about someone being at risk for a disease. It's great she's doing well now, but someone's health is very much at risk.

Fuck the cheating part - this could actually destroy Cat's life and even kill her. That's not cool.

There's low risk routes she can take to let Cat know - she could have a friend do it, she could do it herself then block her. "
But why should she be excited that uninvolved children are being put through hardship? Thats sociopath shit dude
":( sending you good vibes via internet, friend. "
"I really don’t know, honestly. I haven’t actually been looking for a job because I am satisfied with mine. "
"&gt;she said something about being happy he couldn't contribute to his kids college funds and child support

What the hell.  She is a bad person.  GTF away from her."
"You basically just really don’t want to hear actual advice. You keep saying, “But what if...” “But she didn’t really...” etc. So either you’re just here to mess with people by refusing to heed their advice, or you’re in complete denial about the reality of this situation. Either way, you’ve gotten the advice you’re going to get, &amp; no amount of backpedaling on your part is going to change the tone of the advice. It’s your turn whether to decide if you’re proud of this person when she acts like this. "
Does it have with little evil frosting roses?
"This is standard advice in these situations, but make sure you have a back-up plan in case this girl isn't who she says she is or things otherwise go south. You need to arrive with enough money for at least a hostel if you can't stay with her as planned. And be SUPER careful, you really don't know anything about this person.
BUT, you have the tickets, so worst-case scenario you have a solo holiday somewhere you've always wanted to go. Hell, I bet there's even some Redditors in Tokyo you could hit up. Go and have an adventure!"
"Yeah I would break up with OP.

That shit is insane. Yes his GF got way too drunk...

But I wouldn't leave a stranger like that... but someone I supposedly have loved for 2 years?!? Like Christ, OP is a sociopath."

Your bf took advantage of you when you got together and picked you like picking a brood mare for himself. I think you should question a relationship with someone who tries to hookup with teenagers while they are almost 30 to try to convince them to bear his children asap
Even the phrasing of this is horrifying. He 'wants you' to stay a certain way? He already feels in charge of your body and thinks he gets to dictate your appearance. 
"Life is trying new things. 

Find ways of making it less intimidating, go with her perhaps or help her deal with her inital anxiety (positive talk, deep breaths, discussing the reasons why she is scared). It's an important life skill to be able to try new things and to be able to overcome fear. Not to say that she has to love everything on the list but pushing the comfort zone of hobbies is exactly what you can and should do as a kid, it sets you up for being able to do it without parental support one day.

It also sounds like she may need professional help so the counselling suggestion is a good one, there should be resources at her school, if not have a chat with your folks about local resources focusing on kids."
"This is how the ancestry dna tests work. You can opt in to be connected to other relatives who have taken the tests.

In this case, it’s probable that the mother took the test and opted in to connections partially to be connected to OP if she ever took the test.

Did she tell you she had a kid before you got there?
Ha ha ha that's how you know she really loves you.
"Honestly, you don't have to make a big thing out of ending the friendship.  Text her that you heard she had disinvited you and that it's sad you won't be able to share her special day but you understand the woes of having to limit the guest list.  Wish her the best and slow fade.

Be gracious and generous because what she wants is a reaction.

It sounds like she's made some terrible decisions and they're starting to come back to haunt her.  This little drama of hers is to garner attention and reassert her position of dominance and control.  Probably because her life is spinning out of control.

Don't buy into her insecurities.

Actually, if there is a group chat or whatever, you might want to send your so sweet and supportive message through that.  This pretty much stops her from bad mouthing you.  If you want you can keep contact with all of them.  Just ignore the antics."
I’m glad someone else sees this.  None of the other commentators seem to have noticed.  I thought I was taking crazy pills.  
"I'd very much like to be wrong, but I don't think he's in love with her. He married her because she made his life easier. Realizing she's carried a torch for so long introduces feelings that are intimidating and less ""easy"", so he's freaking out."

And it doesn't matter that ""almost every country in earth"" that isn't illegal because she's in America and THIS IS ILLEGAL. You cannot buy or give alcohol to someone under 21 in the United States UNLESS it is your child, in which the majority of states allow you to do so, even if you're a minor.  You can go to jail for doing this in some states and fined in all of them. 



You're arguing with me as if I'm trying to argue that this law has a moral justification. I'm not, I don't agree with it. But it is illegal. Doing something illegal with someone who you're supposed to be a superior to is a thing you should get fired over."

"She doesn't ""make"" you yell (just like she didn't ""make"" you drop your grades). You choose to yell. You control your actions, no matter how shitty or she's behaving. It sounds like you bring out the worst in each other. Something to keep in mind for the next relationship. 

I'm not defending her, she sounds awful. I'm just saying the ""you make me yell/you provoke me"" attitude is bad and you don't want it carrying over to the next relationship. This relationship sounds toxic as hell. I would recommend getting therapy to deal with this anger before dating again so it doesn't seep into your next relationship. Block her, don't engage with her or ague with her; don't even let her get in touch with you. Just get some help and move on."
This is one of the best replies so far. I hope OP reads this.

"&gt;  sexual camel 

made me lol. 

&gt;  I'm really just curious if anyone had experience with this sort of thing. I feel like, if we agree that sex is an important part of a relationship and not just for making babies, there's a chance we won't end up in /r/deadbedrooms . With enough communication, is this a feasible relationship or am I wasting this girl's time?


Here's the thing: It doesn't matter whether you guys are great communicators or not if you're not sexually compatible. The only way to know if you're sexually compatible is to fuck.

Could it possibly work without testing sexual compatibility? Sure, but it's a shot in the dark. Conversely, a lot of the people in /r/deadbedrooms *did* have sex prior to marriage, so obviously by having sex now you're not inoculating yourself against a dead bedroom in any way, because people and their likes/wants/drives change and there is no way to predict how yours and hers will change in the future. 

Personally, I think you're too young to be thinking about marriage *anyway*. So if the no-sex isn't a dealbreaker, go ahead and date her. 

"
"This is falling into the ""It's not that I don't trust you, it's that I don't trust them"" zone.

"OP, she was a date and a potential suitor (not sure of the female version of this word). She was not your girlfriend.

Maybe you need to maintain perspective while internet dating.

"It doesn’t sound all that complicated to me. Plenty of misogynists are at war with themselves when it comes to the women close to them. They want to believe that THEIR women are the exceptions to their beliefs about women as a whole. When that proves untrue (because inevitably you will do something that reminds them they're not the center of the universe), their resentment rears up and you get sulking, foot-stomping, and petty power plays, magnified by their disappointment that “you’re just like the rest of them”. 

Happens all the time. "
Didn’t mean to frighten anyone. In fact I have 2 major surgeries coming up myself in June. I have a rare condition that causes tumors to grow on my nerves. I’ve had over 20 surgeries already. But I would really recommend that someone watch out for you after. My hospital unfortunately didn’t watch out for me it was my family and a visitor to another patient who was a doctor that pushed for my care by then I was already in the grip of sepsis. Now I have someone watch out carefully and I would definitely recommend everyone have someone to watch out for any signs for them. Good luck with your surgery. 
"&gt;I know you cant just “find the one” you make it but at the same time are there fundamental differences/issues that can’t be resolved?

There's space between looking for ""the one"" in some unrealistic idealized way and just settling for your current awful relationship. You seem to have a pretty clear idea of what you want in a partner: a man who is ambitious, honest and loving with decent communication skills. Your current partner sounds like none of these things. So the opportunity cost is pretty much everything you want in exchange for... what, exactly?

It doesn't sound like you two like each other very much and the relationship sounds miserable for you both. Why are you staying?

"I sort of agree, but the weird thing is that it's so specific to the case. We'll go on vacations together, we'll go out to nice restaurants.

"Stop expending energy trying to change them, and recognize that they will either realize you are still the child they have known and loved for your entire life, or you're better off without their negative influence around you. 

The way I see it, you've now got a years worth of time to work on becoming financially independent from your parents. Get a job, if you don't have one already and save every cent you can. Build a strong social support network of friends during this time as well. Find LGBT groups in your area, and try to engage in the community as well. When a year passes, (or earlier if you can manage it) find a way out of their home and to a place of your own. 

Nothing is wrong with you here. Your parents will either realize it, or not. But if they don't, you're better off without them. There's a saying I want you to remember: friends are family that you choose yourself. Work on finding that family that loves and supports you for who you are, not who they think you should be."

"I mean you have to get real about this. You are asking us to help you contort yourself to tiptoe around his very clear anxiety issues. That is pretty much asking how to be a more efficient enabler because the alternative would be to leave given the impasse him refusing help represents. 

Just be careful. You could find the perfect puppet show to put on for him and that might buy you a little time but the reality is that until he changes you are on borrowed time. I know he is probably fine when he is stable but the frequent anger will take a toll. I know your instinct is to avoid conflict but that is not good for either of you."
"she's venting to a new person of the opposite sex about you.  This is probably one of the biggest examples of a emotional affair red flag there is.  Forget that he's her boss.  You don't get that far down the emotional affair without encouraging it.

This age difference is freaking me the fuck out.

He later calls me at 4:30 saying he's sorry he didn't respond because he was in a heated debate about religion. Wth, that doesn't mean you cannot reply so I at least know you are ok. Doesn't mean you ignore me.

If a significant other *repeatedly* called me while I was in the middle of a social event, and then acted upset and accused me not putting effort in the relationship if I didn't respond, I'd consider it clingy and controlling. The boyfriend is taking the blame for something that's not their fault.

I'm going to second that! I have a relationship with someone on the autism spectrum. Can he say something that comes off the wrong way and sounds harsh? Yes. Does he ever mean it in a bad way?

"Nope. Not toxic. Historically that IS exactly what marriage and symbols of marriage meant. Some people simply are not comfortable with keeping those traditions alive. Other people are OK with them, or have put modern meanings to them. Both stances are totally OK.

When I got married I did not take my partner's last name, I also didn't keep my father's last name either, because I fundamentally disagree with the practice of the woman taking the man's name. My partner and I took a new last name. I rarely refer to him as my ""husband"" and prefer to use the term ""partner"" to distance ourselves from traditional gender roles. We don't wear rings, instead we chose to have matching tattoos. There is nothing toxic about our marriage. It is not the right choice for every couple, but we are happy with our choices. "

"&gt; If the friend suggests doing something on your date night a, ""Sounds fun but GF and I have plans, let's do it on X day instead"" should do the trick.

If your boyfriend *doesn't* say the above to her, but instead comes back to you and says ""Hey, we have to change our plans because Bestie's wife made us plans for that day"" *then* you know you have a problem with your boyfriend that you need to talk to him about. 

If he doesn't understand why the plans you made two made earlier should be the plans that are respected, then seriously reconsider this relationship.

Also be on the lookout (once you two start having plans on your own) if suddenly Bestie's wife starts making plans without telling you that involve tickets that weren't refundable or something that attempts to strong-arm you both into going along with her plans. 

The correct response to something like that is ""Why did you purchase tickets on our behalf without making sure we were free? That is a shame for you, but I'm sure you'll be able to get other friends to use them/sell the tickets/get a refund for them. Next time, be sure to ask us first so this doesn't happen again"". 

The INCORRECT response is to say ""Oh, well, ok then, I guess we'll drop our plans to go with you"". That just teaches her how to make sure she always gets her way.

(ps: I hope everything goes well with your BF being less involved with his friends. Personally, my spidey sense is tingling that this woman will NOT be happy to lose 1/2 of her little harem. So I think you should gear up for some mental games and bullshit. Best case scenario is she retreats gracefully, and you don't have to play any games. Worst case scenario is that some seriously passive-aggressive shit hits the fan, you're prepared for it, and can gauge your boyfriend's reaction to see if you'll be a team establishing your boundaries as a couple OR if he's on team Best Friends Wife, and you should exit the relationship.)"

What about this, let’s sign up to xyz financial course (research and find one you trust), they help us make a budget, and whatever figure we come up with for the new car in the budget we make on the course, that’s what we spend... you decide the car, what do you think? 

Then there’s an element of third party verification that you can only spend so much.

Don’t go down the road of telling her what to do, that won’t go over any better than her telling you what to do, you’re both doing that and butting heads as a result. "
You... really need to rethink your birth control plans. Both of you.
"For me personally, I wouldn't be able to be in a relationship with someone who cannot open up to me. When you're dating someone, especially long term, you should be able to open up to them.

Now I know it's not your nature, but the not opening up could be leading to emotional distance. For example, I feel closer to my SO when he tells me how he is feeling or what is on his mind or if something is bothering him. I know him, his fears, his victories, everything and it makes me feel connected to him on a whole other level.

This could be a moment of self reflection. It feels like you're treating her more as someone you just started dating, with the driving 4 hours and the paying for dates or doing her HW. Try opening up to her, little by little. "
"Hey man, if you like her go for it. When you're 17, having a relationship is fun and comforting. Sure when you're 30 you can worry about it ""not being the right time"".  But when you're still maturing and life is confusing, having someone you care about on your side is great. If you're into her I say go for it. I don't know about this ""she can't handle a relationship"" idea. It sounds like she's having trouble handling life but you're one of the positive parts of it. If I were 17 again I'd date pretty much anyone I found interesting and fun because that's the time to figure it all out and enjoy yourself.  Some of this advice won't be as helpful further down the line, but it sounds like you got a nice girl you care about and a relationship could be many things: comfortable, fun, an escape, romantic, etc.  I'm not seeing a lot of downsides here."
"Anyway, just because you make out with someone doesn't mean you are obligated to have sex. You can say no at any point for any reason."
Oh. Wow. That's... gross. 
"This is incredibly common. I've read a couple articles about it. You can google ""My autoimmune disease diagnosis was a lesson in how often doctors dismiss women's pain"" and ""doctor's dismiss women's pain"" for a whole slew of articles on the topic.

I wish you the best in your health..

As for your boyfriend, I can understand why he'd be super freaked out about cheating, I would be too, but I would also listen to you and be relieved to see the texts."
"If you get involved with other people, you run the risk of having someone violate your trust. It's a shame, but it's how the world works. I fail to see how you could possibly have any kind of arrangement like the one you want without extending some level of trust to the person.

ETA: the only difference between what you apparently want and an actual relationship is the fact that ending it couldn't be called a break-up because you staunchly refuse to acknowledge that it's a relationship without the name. So yeah, you do want to remove yourself from the guilt of a break up."
This is the worst advice ever OP. Get the abortion you’ve already decided to have and never speak to this toolbag again.
"I call bullshit OP. No woman in the history of women would believe the dude wasn't cheating if she came home in the morning to another woman in the house who slept over the night before without the wife knowing about it. 

You badly want him to believe you weren't cheating so you say you'd believe him but it isn't true. Also, does this close male friend have a significant other in his life? If so, does that SO know about him staying over?

If not, what does you and your close ""friend"" relationship look like? To you is he a close friend but to him is he stuck in the friendzone and thinks that by putting in enough ""nice coins"" he will eventually get a shot?"
You don’t think introducing a young child to someone you’ve only been dating for two months is way too soon?
I guess I just can’t understand why you two rushed into an engagement when you are both so young and the relationship was in the early stages. Making a huge commitment to someone you have yet to really get to know and fully understand does reek of recklessness and of desperation. 
"&gt; they are BROTHERS are you forgetting how stupid brothers are, and how the closer they are the dumber they also can be?

I always love it when people try to imply that because they are male they are dumb, and thus should be excused from common decency.

Dumb is not a defense.

"&gt; ""If it can't work out, then please just leave me alone because it hurts more.""

This is absolutely okay to say to her and you should do so.  I can't say if she's holding on to old habits or what, but if you are uncomfortable with it then she should respect that."
So text her. She can’t read your mind and she’s probably giving you space.

"I think you should stick to a non sexual friendship. Honestly physical prettiness is one thing but beauty comes from within more than anything. And someone will truly find her beautiful while you may not. Don’t waste her time and yours, don’t use her for sex. She seems nice, you have already expressed she has a lot to offer. So let her offer that to someone else who isn’t unsure about her. In the long run i think your idealize and lack of attractiveness toward her will leave the relationship lack luster anyway. "
"Don't forget the coda: he dates another woman and realizes that *""Whoa! The prior girlfriend wasn't defective! Turns out that NO woman is willing to give me hundreds of orgasms forever when I refuse to stimulate her clitoris in any way!""* Like, he's REALLY spoiled right now -- I'm sure OP is highly skilled at stimulating him after a year of thrice-weekly blowjobs, handjobs, frottage, etc. He's going to have a harder time getting off with someone who hasn't had a thousand hours of experience handling his dick. Hope he ends up with someone as lousy and lazy at sex as he is.

At that point he's going to have a SUDDEN REVELATION that he really *does* want to work on things with OP! Stay strong, OP. This dude is an orgasm thief. He doesn't even know what fingering is! It's not just sticking your finger in and out like a piston. Sheesh. I wonder if he stirs soup by putting his spoon in it, lifting it out, putting the spoon back in, lifting it out, etc. Or gives ""backrubs"" by poking people in the spine with his thumb. "
"Yup, this is receipts, right here.

So when she cuts those phony friends off and they fake the ""I would NEVER!"" she can bring the pics up and go ""Oh you wouldn't?!""

"The California lifestyle is very different. It would be good to spend increasing amounts of time outside, even just walking around the neighborhood. The weather is made for it and the more time you spend in the sun and fresh air the better. Worse case is you are sad outside instead of inside, best case is you get less isolated and physically healthier. In the beginning you have to force it but then it gets easier. Once you find that you enjoy spending time outside, you can join your husband in some of his activities. 

It’s important to try to build an affection for the outdoors on your own first because if you just jump into trying to join his events he will be able to tell that you are miserable out there and then you both will be sad. Step 1 is being happy in SoCal outside by yourself and Step 2 is spending time with your partner outside when you have developed a taste for the outdoors so you both can be happy. "
"Yep.  Female here.  I watched this happen with so many of my girl friends once they hit about 24 - 29 yrs old. They started pretty much foaming at the mouth and NEEDING to get married.  Didn't even matter to who. Most are divorced now.  

A few are still married, but miserable.  One admitted to me the other day that she's still breastfeeding her 2 yr old because it's the only way to keep her husband (who she can't stand) away from her.  She admitted that she never really liked her husband. But, at the time, she had just turned 29, which to her was ""old"", so she latched on to the 1st guy who was around."
"Hey, OP - did you take any photos of the cross stitching while in process of making it? Have you still got leftover material? That would be one way to prove it was your present.


I cannot imagine why anyone would claim to have made a present when they haven’t...I do think it’s unlikely that your cousin is lying though. Maybe she genuinely doesn’t know and just believes what she’s been told? I definitely think it’s worth having a private conversation with her when no one else is around. Some people here have commented that she may be scared of her in laws - make sure you ask her how she’s doing and that she can always call you, no matter what.



Lastly, I’d like to say something to you, OP:

What a wonderful and thoughtful present you made her! Even if she doesn’t know you made it, she’s obviously very touched by it, which means you absolutely nailed it! Maybe that can cheer you up a bit? :)"
"I had a nanny growing up and it was always a thing for her to brush my hair after the shower. She'd take special care to take the little knots out with our special comb. I visit her every couple years and would ask her to brush my hair and let her ask me questions I know she's always dying to ask like who have I been dating and what's he's like etc. 


It's not a need, just a nice way to for a maternal or parental figure to sit down with you and talk for a little bit. It's also a bit of ""doting"" for the daughter I'm guessing. I felt the same way. "
Europeans aren't uniform in culture. European women do not uniformly share opinions any more than the men. 
"Well, that and still wanting her dad to brush her hair at 16. It's great that they have a close relationship, but this is pretty outside the norm for most teenagers."
"I’m not justifying it by any means, but I’ve met a few engineers that are very socially awkward to the point that it’s rude. I just wouldn’t pay attention to her, and if she screams at you again, take it to HR. When I was in school, another guy in my industrial engineering classes acted the same way. He had no sense of humor unless he made a joke- which was usually at your expense, he didn’t know how to respond to very basic questions like “how was your weekend?” without saying something like “it’s none of your business. Why do you care?” 

Just ignore her. I get you have to work alongside her so that could be difficult, but I’d give her no attention whatsoever unless you have to. If she berates you again like that, just go straight to HR. If she acts like that, she’s not going to listen to you saying “stop it!”- it’s going to take someone with authority to tell her to get it through her head.

I hope it gets better for you, and I hope my insight helped some. "
You left a cult. Congrats! You had to know your post would cause a shitstorm. And your father is an abusive ass. Stick to your guns and leave the toxic people behind. Even if it's your whole family. Those people are brainwashed and dangerous.   
"I am a 29F and I have 5 little brothers and 3 younger sisters.

I have the relationship you described with most of them and the ones I dont its only because they arent touchy people. The only difference is this close relationship extends pretty much to the SO's as well. We are hispanic so it is normal to kiss on the cheek for greetings and goodbyes and sleeping in the same bed or spending a ton of time together is very common between us. 

One of my sisters (shes 17) invites me over to nap... she will literally ask me if I want to hang out and when I say yes she says she wants to nap and I go to her house (I moved out she lives at home) and we nap.  

I can imagine it looks super weird to people who dont have siblings but when you have a good relationship with a sibling its like beyond a best friend. They are an extension of you, a person you could have been, they understand you on a level no one else can or will. 

as for her comments. Talk to her about them (with your bf having a heads up) just say ""ïdk if its just regular teenage attitude or you have a problem with me but Id love to hang out with you just the two of us so maybe we can have a better relationship"""
He will change when you and a few more women dump him for the same reason
"Why is being mocked for being infertile any different than being made fun of for being vegan? Please, explain. I'm interested to understand why you think there is a difference.

I personally think that if the mocking is mean-spirited, it does not matter what the subject is. I can mock you for being short, or having a small penis, or for having a weird nose, or for having a high shrieky voice, or for the food you eat, or for the way you walk - they all hurt."
"He does have his own car, right? He is driving his car to see his friends, presumably, so what is his problem? 

Tell him very clearly that you are not getting a new car, you don't want a new car and it is annoying and disrespectful that he won't let it go. Tell him that his attempts to be subtle by pointing out cars he thinks you would like are actually glaringly obvious and he needs to stop. Then see what he does. If he continues to harass you, you have a boyfriend problem. Does he disrespect you in other ways as well?"
It is absolutely a valid excuse. 
"Ok, you say you can't involve the police because that will make it worse, but you are contemplating suicide. It kind of sounds like it has gotten as bad as it can get if you are thinking of suicide. 

You are stronger than you think! You are important, and worth while. This environment has made you think differently of yourself, but your value has not changed. You are valuable and deserving of a loving home. You can do it, you can call police, you can leave, you can get a job and save and make it to 18 and leave, you can see into getting legally emancipated. You can! 

Get help. You are worth the help! If anything tell the guidance counselor you are suicidal, if they can't get you away from mom they can at least suggest medical help. "

It's as reasonable a paragraph as OPs not wanting to talk about the issue and just break up 
"Oh please “you don’t have the heart to tell her?” Yeah right! You’re not thinking about what’s best for her or worried about hurting her, you’re worried about ruining your own summer and causing problems with trips you have planned. You want to selfishly use her and strong her along for the summer and then announce your decision to break up with her just before you leave for college. If you gave a shit about her and how she feels, you would be honest and decent and tell her the truth now, since she is already upset about it and has told you clearly she wants to know what will happen with your relationship. It’s pretty gross and frankly cowardly to dress up your decision to deceive her and selfishly use her for sex and fun as concern for not ruining her summer. It would be different if you hadn’t made a decision yet and needed time to think, but you have made a decision, she’s asking you for an answer and you’re refusing to give it. "
I don’t see how you can possibly think you know better than her what is best for her. She *told you* what is best for her - she wants to know rather than having this hanging over her head for the whole summer. If you are a decent person you will respect her enough to be honest with her. Being deliberately deceitful is rarely if ever best for anyone.
"Cut contact with them all. It's the only thing that is going to make everything ""stop"" and give you some peace. It's super fucked up that they schemed it all up and tried to make you out to be the bad guy in order to trash your relationship. Two wrongs don't make a right. Your girlfriend thinking she can cheat because she was under the assumption you did isn't cool. "
"It’s up to Dawn who she invites. Yes you are being unreasonable to expect that your mom and sister be invited. If any of my husband’s relatives by marriage had thought we were adding their family members to a guest list already bursting at the seams, I’m ashamed to say I might have laughed at them and then been like, “Ohhh...you were serious.”

But it’s up to you how you handle things with your son. You guys are his parents. I don’t have to agree with your decisions or understand your feelings, what matters is that YOU do and you own them. If you don’t think your son can handle being there with both of you standing up, then you get to choose if he goes. Dawn doesn’t get to control that. She can have you guys both in the wedding party, or she can have your son there. 

The key is not to ask her to change anything but to work with what you are given and stand firm in your navigation being the best choice for your nuclear family."
"30 days in rehab changed me.  I was about where this guy is and remember physically going into withdrawals in the ER with my kid who was about that age.  I’ve been sober for a year now and it’s hands down the happiest time in either me or my wife’s lives.

I’m not saying my story is common but treatment can work."
"Social exclusion is a form of bullying. It’s one of the most common ways that adults bully other adults. I am for sure not one to accuse everyone of being a bully, but I have seen this happen and and it was done intentionally to leave someone out and make them feel bad. Humans are social creatures, and rejection from a group is normally a very painful experience. "

"Slightly off topic, but my lovely husband recently got me a coffee mug that says “Please don’t confuse your Google search with my medical degree,” and looking at it every morning is basically anger management therapy."
It’s a relationship destroying strategy is what it is
"How did she react when you spoke to her last? Did she seem upset or like she didn't care much? I think that will influence people's opinion on this a lot. If she seemed fine then yeah, it sounds like she's not being a very good or caring friend. If she seemed really upset then it could be that she's just feeling guilty, assuming that she's the last person that you'd want to talk to right now, etc. "
"The coworker who sat next to me used to smack her lips when she chewed. After months of gritting my teeth, I finally decided to ask her nicely if she could make less noise when she was eating. It wasn’t a “confrontation” and I waited until no one else was around as not to embarrass her. 

We had a very friendly relationship and I figured that as long as I was nice about it, she would be too, and what do you know - she was fine. She had no idea she was that loud, she apologized, and from then on was much better. 

Sometimes it’s ok to let people know what’s up. Most normal, sane people can accept a friendly request. "
She's too far in denial right now I think. When it inevitably gets worse I hope she'll come back here and listen to the advice. This man is not a normal person and he is going to wreak havoc on those children's psyches.
"Also just so people know it’s homemade! I worked really hard on an intricate cut-paper design for Christmas cards and had them printed at Staples, and my friends and family apparently had no idea I’d made them myself and barely mentioned them."
"No, no, no!

The problem here is not that she needs to try different things in order to make sex less painful. Stop telling OP to try and accommodate this crap.

He knows he hurts her, he has acknowledged that it hurts her and he knows it, *and he does it over and over anyway*."
"None of the in-laws were at the shower where I gave her the gift. I contacted Lindsey's sister about a gift list and she said Lindsey's best friend was the one making the list. There's a chance the gift list got misplaced, but everyone I know that was at the shower received a thank you note months ago."
"Yeah I see this being the most logical answer. A mixture of guilt, shame, and wanting to give space. "
"\&gt;  I asked her to please do it for me and she won't

You've asked. You received your answer. Beating a dead horse is pointless and annoying to the people who have already given their answer. So, now it is time to make the decision on if this is something you feel is worth ending a relationship over."
"Yeah, the last ""fat husband"" post I read had the fat husband calling his thin wife fat and blaming the lack of sex on her supposed fat. Context matters. The rest of the story matters."
"The one part that sounds really weird is having people sleep on the floor. 
Your husband is an adult though, he can handle this too. "
It's rude and selfish that he doesn't care enough to make you finish before himself. Or help you after he is finished. 
"That depends on the man, but those aren't universal dealbreakers or anything.  Plenty of people are not into social media, and don't care for PDA, so even if *he* isn't okay with it there would be someone out there who was.  Having to actively hide a relationship puts a strain on it and isn't sustainable, but just not *advertising* it is different and is what some people prefer.  Sounds like it's certainly worth giving it a shot, so go for it! I wish you the best of luck! "
"You have 50k in savings because your father is paying for ALL your life expenses.  Pay for your rent phone, utilities, car, car insurance, groceries, etc.  You should be helping. You are an ADULT. Stop relying on daddy.  He clearly can't afford it. "

"Many years ago I was having lunch with my then boyfriend. I was telling him how a friend of mine had called me, at work, while she was cutting herself. I was upset, understandably so I think!

Then-BF looks up from his sandwich and says “Twoferrets, I’m just not interested.”

I should have gotten up and left him right then and there, but the shock of it was just numbing. You can benefit from the hindsight of people in this thread, OP. Don’t spend anymore time with someone who doesn’t respect you.

(Regarding the friend I was trying to tell him about- she’s in great shape these days, happily married and enjoying the hell out of motherhood. So happy for her!)"
I’ve sat here trying to figure out if one of the cousins dated one girl or all three of the cousins dated the same girl. 
"Yes exactly. Pro gaming isn't something he'll be able to do until he's like 60+. 
I'm sorry but I think if he doesn't realize that his dream isn't realistic, he'll end up dragging you both down. I'm ALL in for gaming, but people need to have their eyes open in the real world as well. Who knows, he might be happy doing general labour with gaming as a hobby. He can also work his way to a better position later. So if he wants to move to where you are and get a job, that's awesome. Make sure he realizes what that entails, or else he might end up resenting you, even though nothing is your fault. "
"Well I'm sure some uber progressive will chime in and tell us how we're all insecure and enablers of toxic masculinity for feeling this way, but allowing a good friend of opposite gender to come into your house and take care of you in your most vulnerable state without your significant other knowing would raise some hairs for the majority of us who still live on planet earth."
"You still really aren't getting it. You have to realize you and your friends have mindsets that differ from most people. You are lacking serious communication skills and anyone other than your group of friends will think so as well. Look at this thred. People from all over are agreeing that you were in the wrong for not communicating and you are still saying your bf is ""policing"" who your friends with. You are doing some crazy mental gymnastics here. "
"Do not do this. Do not make it a competition about who is the most irresponsible. Talk to her and communicate to her about the situation. Decide on a budget. And let her get whatever she wants in that budget. 

You need to put your foot down. And a blank cheque is a ridiculous idea. The last purchase happened because both of you agreed to it. This should happy only when both of you agree to it."
"As their child, you can't make this situation any better. You're probably the last person your parents would listen to, even if they were looking for advice.

Save money. Move out as soon as you can. Until then, spend as much time as possible out of the house. Stop letting them vent to you, because it doesn't help at all. Involving their kid in their marriage problems like this is just another form of abuse."
Ask him to be logical then. What is the benefit of him owing the money to your parents compared to his? Tell him that the only logical explanation is that he is counting on not having to pay your parents back. Ask him if this is truly what he is after.
"what even is this sub. you got strippers at his bachelor party from him saying ""don't give her any ideas"" about marriage. It was clearly a joke.

"Maybe he subconsciously interpreted your ""settl(ing) into a quieter love"" as withdrawing, so he's pushing harder than ever to ""earn"" your love.  
  
You say he's ""strong,"" ""confident,"" etc - I'll bet he usually rises to a challenge; use this to your advantage.  Challenge him: ""you can only give me one sentence of compliments today.""  Or: ""you can only compliment me once after you tell me three things you like about yourself and I have to agree with each one.""  
  
For date night, tell him you want to try something new to you, go somewhere you've never been - but you don't want to waste your time, so you don't want to go somewhere or do something he hasn't already tried once and confirmed is good.  
  
As far as his hobbies, give him no choice - make yourself scarce on nights when his activities are available.  ""I'm going to work on crafting your birthday gift on Tuesday nights, so you need to be out of the apartment while I work you don't spoil the surprise.  Tuesday night is when you usually go rock climbing, right?  I'll text you when you can come home.""  Or ""you need to keep doing Warcraft raids with your friends on Thursdays because I don't want you to lose those friends, they're really great when they come over for parties and I want to set them up with some of my friends.  I need the time to read a book a week for my book club, so you need to stay for the whole raid night.""  
  
Overall, explain to him that you fell in love with the man he is, and you want him to keep being that man (who is still considerate of you), not a man who tries to be what you or anyone else wants him to be.  "

"You know what would make me reconsider if I were Sarah? If your company reached out, apologised and let me know they had fucking fired Bob. Reprimands don’t mean shit and he screwed up colossally. I would not be confident to agree to work at a company that allowed Bob to stay on after such behaviour, and where I might be forced to work with Bob on a daily basis and have him as one of my managers. I sincerely doubt that Bob is a great guy and this is the first time he has pulled inappropriate shit in the workplace. His behaviour indicates someone that’s long ago lost sense of proper boundaries or professionalism. This isn’t a monetary minor screw up. It’s a pattern of crazy and embarrassing behaviour. "
"I am sorry it came down to this because whatever you choose now is going to hurt on one level or another.

1\- If you chose to patch things up and swim with the current, then you're basically remarrying as a slave. You will never be the woman of your household to the man of your household  which tends to crush down relationships faster than anything else. Additionally, your words shine a light on your independent and loving soul, it would be near impossible to live within the confines of such an arrangement.

2\- If you hose to patch things up and swim with the current **but** kept at ""defying"" your MIL maniacal behavior then you're in for a fast railroad to disappointment land because your husband clearly can't or won't stand up for his own marriage's independence. You clearly can't handle this because that's what you've been coping with so far and for so long with no light at the end of the tunnel.

3\-

&gt;  be a quitter and divorcee after two short years with a man I love  

You dread this choice, you hate that your stable life is being intruded upon and crushed by the likes of your MIL. All due respect to all MILs but there are just boundaries that you can never ever cross or you're living the couple's life for them. I don't like this choice either to be fair, it is the last option to consider and the last card to draw if all else fails.

Things have changed permanently and masks were removed but that doesn't always mean its for the worst. Talk to your husband quietly and patiently, show him how great an independent marriage would be \- how he can respect his mother and seek her comfort without stepping allover your relationship together. He needs to make sacrifices for her sake but he also should make some sacrifices for you.

You are **HIS WIFE**. Don't lose your footing in this battle or else the war is lost.

Best of luck to you and my deepest wishes that all ends well."
"Seems pointless for him to have a solo interview with her then, doesn't it? Why would he need to meet with her at all if that's the case? 

For my current job I only had one in person interview, and it was with the executive director, the chief of staff (who is my direct supervisor), and the director of finance (who I support and take direction from daily). Irrelevant people weren't there. I really question why Bob was interviewing her solo to begin with, even before he chose to have it at a brewery on a holiday."

Right?  He should be happy that his brother hasn't had to suffer as much.
"&gt;He’s part of a management team that oversees office decisions but doesn’t really have any say in what goes on

Then why the fuck is he interviewing her?!? Multiple interviews are a total waste of everyone’s time anyway. You all liked her, so why not just hire her?"
You are downplaying what he did. This wasn't just forgetting an interview. This was unprofessional behavior that really hurt the company's image. He is displaying concerning behavior that in any other workplace would have gotten him immediately fired. 
Or maybe he secretly hungers to live life as a sub. /s

"I don’t even like dogs but you are not coming across well at all in these comments. I was 100% on your side based on the post, but now....Jesus, have some decency. It’s still a living creature, and it’s not its fault but hat your husband did. Maybe try to be a human about it.  

Of course you shouldn’t have to live with the dog, of course your husband was entirely wrong, but now you’re just being cruel to something defenseless who didn’t do a single thing to you except exist. I know you’re emotional right now but you need to step back and get some perspective.  And this from someone who’s not even a dog fan. "
"This....very much so.  The best way to deal with your EX moving on is to realize that he is an EX and his life, going forward, is absolutely none of your business.  What is your business is your life.  Have fun, meet new people, take a course, learn a new skill.  Do whatever you want because you broke up to have new experiences.  He’s moved on, obviously, and you should too.
Good luck."

I am not defending his wife at all but we are only getting OPs side of this and it’s still very clear that he majorly fucked up. They are both trash.
Talk to her about the screenshots. It is sad but somepeople can be pure arses sometimes. it wont stop them thinking what they think about you but at least your gf can understand how it has made you feel and you can move on from this together :)
"Absolutely you should be upset.

Your GF is not willing to act like a life partner. This is exactly the sort of thing that SO's do for each other, because it strengthens the pair's future prospects.

If she doesn't get that, she is not investing in a future for both of you.

Basically, if she doesn't change her mind, you should find a new GF. Someone interested in being a partner."
You should absolutely talk to him about this. Especially if you’re going to marry him. I wouldn’t tolerate that type of behavior; it would be a major red flag for me. 
You should have initiated.

I mean OP deserves it just as much as anyone else they put in the leg work and got in.

"&gt; This translates directly to parenthood. 

I really don't know man, I've had pets I really don't click with. I mean a responsibility is a responsibility I agree in most cases but I don't know I don't think this is one of those situations that bad pet owner = bad parent in 10/10 cases."
"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I've read this plot in erotica and Freudian case studies and laughed at it, but it's not funny when it actually happens.

I think you and your husband should take a bit of distance from Jake, as much as possible -- for example,

* Getting Jake placed in a different department, tactfully redirecting him to apply for jobs elsewhere next
* Not attending the same family events (for now)
* Giving up the idea of Jake as surrogate son

In the meantime, work out a plan with your husband - as a team - for how the two of you will help Jake out of his crush. He can probably handle it; I'd prepare for him to experience some transference onto women who resemble you, but that't not the worst thing in the world. This might take the form of a letter reminding Jake of your relationship with him; it might take the form of talking to your SIL (Jake's mom) about therapy. 

Your husband may want to do a couple sessions of therapy also - to help him accept and move past the awful betrayal he must be feeling from Jake. I don't hear any notes of jealousy or suspicion or tension in your marriage, which is awesome (!), but please also talk to him to make sure there isn't something with you that this whole mess shakes up."
"This is definitely abuse as others have mentioned. Intelligence is all in comparison, view point, and opinions. Is a person who has a PHD in an area, but has little to no knowledge in much of any other area intelligent? Depends on the situation you put that person in. We all know what we know and you can make anyone look and feel stupid when you focus on things they have a harder time defending themselves in.

It seems to me that your idea of this guy being wonderful, is based on him having more experience and understanding of life in certain areas of life than you. He chose a young girl that has not truly got to experience as much in life. He was the idiot, not because he chose you, but because he didn't get to know you and find out if you were a good match for him. If you want this marriage to work, the effort needs to be on his part to see your value and be positive and encouraging you to help you get more experienced; not public shaming for mistakes and what you do not know. This is disgraceful on his part. Good marriage partners build each other up; not tear each other down. "

Leave leave. You were in a state of shock and I would be worried you put yourself in that state again. It seems all nice until it isn’t and you wouldn’t want this to reoccur even if it happened again by accident.
"Next time he performs, offer to film it for him. Later, suggest that he posts it to YouTube to get his work out there. The comments will be honest and bring him back down off his high horse. He needs a bit of humbling it seems.
Also, if he does, I hope you post the link on this thread please"
"I would consider her treatment of him really mean (you say its not abusive but it is quite mean). 

Ignoring him in his crate when he hasn't peed a long time, and not giving him proper care/attention may not be hitting him, but it's still quite mean and worrisome when she's actively choosing not to take care of him.

I think I could move past this if she had sucked it up and took care of him, but complained about it then said she wants to sell him. But since her solution was just to ignore him....I wouldn't trust her with children at all."
"Yes, 100% this. I would never be able to live with somebody who not only ran past myself and our infants in a swam of wasps without even SAYING something, and then left us in a hot shed for over an hour. Even IF he had a panic reaction to run for the door, he could've come back immediately."
Keep the dog. Ditch the girlfriend.
"I think you need to sit him down and ask him yourself why he does this and how he feels about you/himself. If you don't know how to explain it to him, just show him this post.

If he's insecure, then you should start making an effort to encourage him to be firmer and less reliant, compliment him, raise up his achievements. Do a little of what he does for you. Ask him what you can do for him, and remind him you that you love him and want to support him.

Bear in mind that if he ignores you and refuses to change or understand his behaviour when you explicitly ask, it's selfish on his part, even if it doesn't seem that way-- he's prioritising what he thinks over how you feel."
Ok...so that's good. So what's your question to r/relationships?
"Just a reminder than many unforeseeable health problems beyond one’s control cause major weight gain.

"You really should put that in the post, OP. It literally sounds like your dad is a serious racist."
"Her husband is demonstrating such bad judgment here, it's easy to imagine he will exercise similar bad judgment when deciding whether or not her nudes could be shared publicly without her consent. In a similar vein, his callous feelings towards his best friends emotional well being tell me that he's probably the type of guy who may want this as a fantasy, but as soon as it actually happens at his request, he will start heavily sex-shaming OP and end up resenting her for sleeping with Carl, or some other guy. I would proceed with extreme caution, and question whether or not he has the emotional maturity to handle any sort of swinging or hot wifing. Based on his lack of communication skills (spring this all on OP at once with a specific party picked out) and his lack of good judgment (trick his best friend into thinking he's engaged in an affair and likely ruin the friendship) I'd say he's not capable of this."
"She probably gets them witha prescription when she's actually sick, but has leftovers from stopping taking them as soon as she feels better. :("

Go to the parents because this kind of behaviour ESCALATES if it isn’t stopped.  Talking to him will do nothing to put it off if his parents aren’t aware of the issue. "
"I’m not autistic but I do have borderline personality disorder and some other psychological problems. I am in a relationship for seven years and I put my partner through hell and back for the first two years. I don’t know if any of this will help you but what we have done is the following. 

-I had trust issues so we made a plan that he would go out without me at least once a month and he would send me three textst at most 1. When he arrived 2. When he was having a good time and 3. When he was about to leave. He would ignore any text from me unless it was an andere from me to his text. For me it was helpful not in the beginning but after a few times.

- he is outgoing and I’m that person at a party that when you ask everybody at the end of it if I was there that nobody knows for sure. I don’t like social interaction at all... so we made plans to do something (100% planned so i would know what I would be doing at any given time) like going to a pub where I could also catch my breath outside. I disliked it at first but seeing him having a good time made it worth it for me. Besides that I got to pick a few locations as well ( think cinema or park) whilst he would pick a concert or pub.

- he loves cuddles and kisses and I just don’t, as of today I’m still trying to love kisses but i still just don’t he knows this and does not bug me about it anymore (I am still trying though) so for me it is easier to write it down, so everyday when he goes to work I put a little note in his lunchbox to tell him i love him and if he is wearing something i love on him that day i will tell him that to. Something like “ hey goodlooking, have a great day at work , have a nice lunch and I will see you tonight. I love you to the moon and back! Xoxo your girl. 
He loves those notes and he even saves some of them.

-I have no problems with being sexual anymore but I did have a problem with it for the second and thirt year due to something that happend to me in the past. He was very understanding but of course after I talked about it. That is a hard thing for me to do, but ever since we talk. That is so important to do, make a Movie night at home, buy something to drink that you both enjoy maybe some chips or other fingerfood that you made yourself to go along with it and just talk. I used to hate laying on his chest with my head but now this is actually how I will end up laying. And what you talk about is not important , could be a funny story from when you where little to a shitty day at work, the conversation will flow naturally after a while.

I don’t know if any of this will be able to help you, I sure do hope so. I wish you and your partner all the best!
And I am very sorry for my English, I am still learning the language! Good luck!"

"Wow how can one person be such a shit parent to not only one, but two of their kids.  I'd hold out hope for the ten month old; but you clearly haven't matured as a parent in over twenty years, so, yeah."
"Your fiancé is telling you and his brother two completely different things, I guarantee. Which means he’s lying to one of you. 

You know him best - what do you think the chances are that his brother is the one he’s bullshitting?"
"Yeah, but she was not a part of any of those memories and it's still pretty insensitive to bring it up as an outsider to someone who may have still had extreme feelings associated with that place. I'm not saying she was being malicious, there's plenty of people who just don't know what boundaries to not cross or when to not bring sensitive topics up, but that's still... strange to bring up."
OP needs to realize how insulting it is to someone he supposedly likes for him to think he knows her own mind better than she does. 
"She may want to get a second opinion from a doctor about her current situation with her anxiety, or at least think about getting a different therapist that specializes in anxiety disorders. It seems like she could be managing it better."
I am guessing OPs GF is insanely hot. The level of crazy is directly related to hotness.
I don't think the daughter is the toxic one on this relationship.

Sex with someone who is incapacitated by alcohol is not legal. It can be considered rape. An older man got his underaged subordinate drunk and could have raped her. What were his intentions?
"This sounds like the case of a guy who wants to have regular sex with you on his terms, when he wants, but doesn’t want any of the real boyfriend responsibilities that come with that. He’s having commitment issues and anxiety  because he’s trying to keep up the facade to you of a relationship in the ways he’s been taught to (have you meet his parents etc.) but isn’t being honest with himself that what he really wants is a FWB scenario. He sounds selfish, immature and not ready for a real relationship."
"Honestly, I much rather have my husband snoop through my phone than find a porno of him online. "
[deleted]
"Wait, so she would rather not have sex at all than have it only once or twice a week? Listen, anyone who you are totally incompatible with sexually, and has broken up with you FIVE TIMES, is someone you should clearly not be seeing. "
"This isn't what you want to hear, but he does have his shit together. He's doing exactly he needs to be doing, which is working on himself and not getting into a relationship he's not ready for. He's trying to respect you by not continuing to spend time with you when you want something he can't give you. You need to respect him by acknowledging his needs as well. 

I think you should probably just cut off contact because any communication is going to make it worse. I think you should send him a text to that affect \(he's already said continued contact will give you the wrong idea so he won't be surprised\) and tell him he knows where to find you if he changes his mind. Don't be passive aggressive or snappy. He sounds like a great guy who just isn't in the same place as you. "
"&gt;What an empty phrase that is.   
&gt;  
&gt;See how things go.

"Ha, report back once this train wreck plays out."
"Under no circumstances is Gina's behavior normal. \(Except that she has been acting like a toddler, and toddlers are known to need help getting dressed.\) If she is treating you like this, she will treat any of his girlfriends like this. She will allow him to be in no healthy relationship, unless it's with her \(and then very likely it will not be healthy\).

She wants you out of the picture and wants him all to herself. She thought she was getting that when he finally moved out of his parents and in with her. You've spoiled things for her. He needs to move out or accept that Gina is his girlfriend.

There is such a thing as healthy boundaries. You are allowed to have your boundaries. A Deal breaker. No woman I know would be ok being with a man who puts up with this kind of shit. Would your mom put up with her guy allowing this? Would his mom? Would any of his or your sisters or cousins? How would Gina react if the shoes were on different feet? You won't come off as controlling to give an ultimatum.

How disrespectful toward you! Don't let him downplay any of it. If he takes her side at all, he's taken her side. You've been seeing each other for over a year. **He should be putting you first.** He should be moving in with you and not another woman who is comfortable completely mortifying you, standing there naked in front of both of you.

If he can't grow a spine, get rid of him. This shit will just continue with Gina, even with clear boundaries and even with him not living with her. Give him a chance to grow his spine, and let him go if he doesn't."
"1. Would you say that if you’d seen two women in the exactly same position?

2. I personally wouldn’t consider someone a close friend unless the relationship could include things that. If I couldn’t count on them for full comfort and they couldn’t count on me, they’d be more 2nd degree friend or acquaintance. "
"okay thank you cause I was getting aallll these vibes but couldn't tell if it was my bias or not. the appeal to the majority thing OP is doing is especially weirding me out. i bet my abusive, BPD mom could have written this exact post about my behavior toward her. "
Damn... this is hard. I think the best course of action is to ask your sister what she's comfortable with your wife knowing. 
"&gt; But man, most guys reading this would kill for a girl like this.

Thanks, just want to point out it evens out, because I got plenty of bad traits like interrupting people an being a terrible procrastinator. 

I am probably too emotional now to figure out the long-term plan. Plan in case if he gets help? Plan in case he doesn't?

Gotta figure out the next 1-2 months first, especially getting myself together."
"This is a huge point that I feel is being overlooked. OP's fiance clearly had no intention to tell her and when she found out he went like ""oh yeah, but it's totally not a big deal at all"", *come on*."
What happens when someone doesn't pay?
"Why did she kick you out?

You will probably have to go through the French authorities to get your documents back, you might be better off posting on a French subreddit for legal help. "
"It is when the person is dumping you. With the end of the relationship comes the end of the commitments made in the relationship. Taking an ex will ruin the trip for everyone. There will definitely be awkwardness and tension. Where as if op and dad go alone, there will most likely be bonding and emotional healing. You could say breaking up with someone is rude too. But life isn’t always polite. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do for your own well being. "
"He may not be your favorite person, but not a reason to unjustly accuse him.  Especially when your husband knows his sister is more than likely the culprit."
"This is incorrect. There is no default name change when you get married. The name on your marriage license is your maiden name. When you go to SS  to change it, you can change it to anything. If you want your maiden name as your middle name, then you do it yourself. I chose to keep my actual middle name. My name at no point defaulted to my maiden name. Getting married changes no one's name, period."
That could potentially just be vaginal discharge.

"As an abuse survivor, your instincts are probably better attuned than those of the average bear.  

If Jen took some basic safety precautions, would that help to allay your fears? 

- Jen goes no contact with this jackwagon. Never again does she argue with him. It goes without saying that she never lets him in the apartment again for any reason. If he shows up again, the protocol is to tell him to leave one time or you call the police, and then immediately following through if he doesn't take the hint. If he leaves before they get there, make another report. 

- Look into what it would take to get a no contact or restraining order against him. 


- You and Jen should make a police report. They may have useful security advice, and this starts a paper trail in case you have to call them. 

- Get renter's insurance. 

- Jen should pay to change the locks 

- Get a security camera that records for any entrances. That way you can see for yourself if he is nosing around. If so, make another police report. 

- Ask your neighbors to keep an eye out for him and not to speak to him. Also Jen should advise her work not to give him any information about her."
"I've been around a lot of old people. I have never, ever seen an instance of an entire family unit or even most of a family unit turn on one member of the unit for no reason. It's really easy to to decide that these people are a bunch of fuckers for not acting the way you think they should, but all you know is what *you* know.

 Being old and/or infirm doesn't mean you get to be automatically forgiven for hurting people when you were younger and more spry. True Story: I worked in an LTC facility and there was a guy in there whose family never called, never came to see him, never did anything for him ever. When someone had to call his designated proxy to make medical decisions for him, messages left went unanswered  or they got hung up on. Eventually the state had to appoint a proxy for him. Then he died, and the state buried him. A lot of my co workers were outraged because he was a pleasant though thoroughly addled old guy, and how dare his family do him this way. One of my colleagues decided to try to find *someone* in his family who would care that he died, so she Googled him. He was a convicted pedophile. I AM NOT SAYING OR EVEN HINTING THAT ANYONE YOU KNOW OR ARE RELATED TO IS LIKE THAT. I'm just saying that you weren't there to see how your grandparents acted before they got old. It's not normal for kids to totally shit can their parents for no reason.  All I'm saying is that there probably IS a reason, and you don't have to agree with it- but your condemnation of your family's actions because of circumstances you can't understand puts you on extremely shaky ground.

"He hadn't mentioned these plans until after she planned out the surprise, that's why she brought it up and why he acted like such a dingus about it"
"Note for you. He can not just 'sign away his rights'. Courts don't allow that, unless there is another person in the picture (usually a new husband) that wants to adopt. The child has rights, and if you were to ever file for social services for the child, the first thing they would do would be to ensure you were receiving child support.

I had an alcoholic partner that would have had a child with me, but wanted no legal or financial responsibility. I consulted a lawyer to draw up the paperwork, and got a big fat 'Uh...nope. Can't do that. Baby has rights, and you as Mother can't sign those rights away"". Just something else for you to consider."

"How many people really ""want"" their significant other's ex at their wedding?  The point isn't what we want.  It's about not teaching your kids dysfunction.  I don't want to drive 55.  But it is what is best for all of us, so that is what I do.  These children need to see that their entire family can get along on the day that is supposed to be pinning them all together for life.  Excluding their mother excludes *them* on some level.  Have a conversation with an adult who was a child of a divorce where strict boundaries were drawn between households.  Children internalize this crap.  If their mom isn't appropriate for inclusion, they feel that in the half of them that is her.  My own wife verbalized this.  Her father was never really welcome at family gatherings after the divorce.  She didn't really know why...she just knew it had to be something bad because no one in her family welcomed him and they were usually nice people.  And then, they would look at her some days and say:  ""Boy, but you are just like your dad.""  And even though they never said it with ugliness, she worried what it meant...because they didn't like the man.  If this woman is unreasonable, the children will discover that.  There is no need to be petty.  Somebody has to behave like an adult here."
"No, I'm sorry but it's ridiculous. 

OP found out last weekend she was pregnant. Her friend asked if she would let her adopt the baby and OP said no. Two days ago friend called and asked if she would reconsider.

I agree that it's one time too many -- but she's not *crazy* and I'm not sure why you keep calling her ""nutty"", like you're implying she's done all these crazy things that OP should be wary of and that's not the case. "

"""How do I do that in a meaningful way that doesn't come across as weird or romantic?""

Don't put anything weird or romantic in the letter. So long as you don't declare your love for her, or comment on her physically etc.. you should be fine.

A thank you letter or card is perfect and really meaningful. I would choose something nice and fairly neutral, because it's not the card, but what's written in it that counts. Keep it short, to the point and essentially write what you've written in your post here, Thank her for helping you when you were "" facing a terrible time at home."", let her know it meant so much to you and that you are grateful she went ""way beyond her responsibilities as a student counselor."". 

Also, tell her you wish her the best as she continues in her life and if you want, comment on her strengths (especially those that she demonstrated helping you), because she might find some tough times in her future and having a letter like yours might be a help to her then."
"The exact same thing happened in our building. It's nasty, disconcerting and also extremely sad. It's okay to feel the way you are; a lot of people can let this kind of thing brush past them, and thus those who are more sensitive \(like yourself and myself\) feel like they're overreacting. You're not; you're just feeling it out in your own way \-\- the key is not to double your worries by thinking that you're overreacting. Don't fall into a pit of despair; just trust that this situation will resolve itself with time, and *only* with time.

The smell is the worst but I swear it will pass and air out. Open all of your windows and leave them open, and run any fans that you might have. It takes about a week. You're going to want to air out your clothes and other permeable items \(hang them outside, on a porch, something like that\) and/or giving them a wash will work as well. I know the smell seems irreparably permeated into all of your objects but it *does* go away! Staying at your boyfriend's parent's place \(same thing I did\) for about a week will help distance yourself from the apartment, the incident, and especially the smell. 

If the smell hasn't sufficiently dissipated over a week or so, I'd look into some kind of crime scene fumigation service. Also, reach out to your parents and friends about what happened; it helps so much to have someone sympathize with you, especially someone other than your bf's parents and your bf himself. I'm guessing they aren't receptive to talking about it much anymore because they think you're overreacting. If you can afford/access therapy, I'm guessing a session or two would help to talk about it as well.

I hope you feel better :\) PM me if you want to talk about it. I swear I went through the exact same thing!"

OP’s wife is literally beating him but because he’s grossed out by her womanchild behavior (ie staying naked all day and doing no chores) he deserves her anger? Nice victim blaming.
"&gt; If your kids can get out of the house, across the neighbor's yard, thru the open gate, and in the pool, all without you noticing them gone, would indicate to me that the gate isn't the issue

I agree. If they can get to the pool they can likely get to the road and traffic."

"An excellent point. The real goal isn't a label, per se, but treatment that works effectively (which is often, but not always, aided by an accurate diagnosis)."
"I tried to explain in the comment above.

My issue is rather... my mother was extremely self\-sacrificing woman, perhaps too much so. There are indeed a lot of people who sell off the family assets to get medical treatment in Israel and the U.S., but she did not want to do such thing... She was standing in all the queues, doing it the route government healthcare way... Every time we suggested she should go get a treatment abroad, she declined. And after all that my father claiming we spent 200k dollars \(price of the house\) on her treatment... That's not fair. That's why it bothers me."
Jesus Christ. Lock the goddamn doors.
"You said you haven't discussed things with him. It's the first thing you need to do. How do you expect him to stop bringing friends over if you always say yes when he asks?

If you can't speak your mind because you fear it will blow up, maybe it's not that great of a relationship.

You need to talk to him ASAP and clear things up, else they won't get better. People can't read your mind."
"girl, RUN. as a former addict to another, get OUT OF THERE!!! sorry, but you shouldn't be working at a bar. you shouldn't be hanging out with a drug addict. you SHOULD NOT BE HANGING OUT WITH AN ABUSIVE MAN. 

what are you doing? how much do you value your sobriety??? better yet, how much do you value your freaking life? this entire mess sounds so dangerous. get your head right and get out."

"Her casually talking to an ex, in public, is in no way disrespectful to you.  You need to grow up, and be less insecure about things.  You are her BF, not her master/owner, and she should be able to talk (for gods sake especially in public / in front of you ) to anyone she chooses.  She's being respectful in saying she won't initiate it.

You really need to reevaluate your behavior and attitude if you think you should leave her over this.

Or better yet, go ahead and leave her now and save her the time it will take for you to reveal your bad attitude upon which she'll probably leave you.

edit:  If I haven't been abundantly clear here, you are absolutely in the wrong for this kind of thinking/attitude."
"Right haha , I hate seeing all these people say their partner used the drunk excuse especially in this one how the fuck does she end up in a 3 some and call it an accident "
"If you’re not attracted to his traits, break up with him. Don’t force him to be something he’s not. "
"Because your past matters, it sucks but your past actions have consequences on how people perceive you. This is the same as someone not wanting to date someone who sold drugs in the past even though they are legit now. "
"Honestly, there is a lot of stigma attached to sex work and I can see why she didn't tell you immediately, but she probably should've told you when you got two got serious. However, personally this wouldn't be an issue for me if it a thing of the past. She can't change that and she did that before she knew you. Honestly it is up for you to decide whether it is a dealbreaker or not. "
"I wouldn't be OK with this. In fact I'd feel gross \- I'm afraid if my partner did something like this to me I'd never be able to see them the same way again.

Am sex\-positive, kinky, etc but everyone has feelings, standards, needs. 

Also agree that your fiance is just claiming that he doesn't want to create a fuss to hide that he really wants this to happen. Which says something else quite important to you about his character. 

I suggest instead of trying so hard not to rock the boat yourself \- be true to who you are and what you feel and need. 

Let him know what you think but above all think. Divorce is far more expensive than a broken engagement. "
"Honestly my dude what you did was way worse.  I work heavily with prostitution and human trafficking research, and have studied massage parlors like that at length.  What your girlfriend did was of her own volition, her own will, and in a situation controlled by her that she could end as she chose (independent of the factors that drove her to it, as those are still valid and shouldn’t be discounted when considering her action).  Alternately, the “happy ending” massage parlors are Very often staffed by women being forced to engage in prostitution to pay off debts incurred trying to move countries for a better life.  Often the women who work there were not told they would be participating in prostitution, and have no ability to leave (through coercion, manipulation, isolation, and sometimes violence or the threat thereof), as well as receiving only a small fraction of the money they “earn”.  And I’m not being dramatic or overstating it, that is the reality of the situation.  Neither are good situations, but what I’m saying is that you have no room to criticize At All.  And you should consider why you have such negative feelings toward her providing a service that you yourself have paid for before- is it because you see prostitutes as inherently dirty or “whores” that you can degrade and immorally exist exclusively to service men without thought, and now that you’ve gotten close to one unintentionally you have to reconcile your preconceptions of prostitutes with what you know to be true about this woman?  And why do you feel that it’s okay for you to engage in prostitution (as a buyer) but not for her to engage in the exact same transaction (just from the other side)?  There are a lot of issues tied up in prostitution, including misogyny, racism, classism, and so many other superiority complexes, and while I’m not accusing you of any of them, I strongly urge you to take some real time to reflect on this because just brushing it off will serve only to hurt you more in the future, and definitely hurt your relationship with this woman and others.  (If you read this and want more info on prostitution pm me)"
"You're so wrong, like holy shit."
"It's a haircut, not OP announcing she's moving out of the house to join the French Foreign Legion. Not really an issue most people are thinking of when they say that families should work together.

It's not even a super in-your-face cut with wacky colors, just regular old bob-length hair. The only thing I'd be worried about is stressing out the sister(which is still kind of silly, but I understand that weddings are stressful and sometimes the couple gets stressed out over stupid things), but OP says elsewhere that she's not bothered by OP's haircut."
"A one and 3 year old cannot \*criminally\* trespass. To criminally trespass you have to intentionally be somewhere you have been told not to be \(warning signs or verbally being told to leave\). Not to mention, they are too young to be criminally anything.  


The neighbor would, indeed, be liable and the homeowner's insurance would be shoving off if the neighbor doesn't have a fence.  Nothing in the OP indicates how large the yards are so we have clue how far it is from their door to the neighbor's pool. Thus, you have no clue how fast that child would need to move.  So, it is unfair of you to approach OP in such a judgmental manner.   
Yes, it is on the parent to watch their kids. But it is also on homeowners to secure their property.  If I have a \(small\) hole in my yard and someone falls and  injures themselves, they can sue! Shit, burglars  have sued and won injury cases in those sorts of situations. :/"
Pfft. What do you want us to do? Help you convince her to let you continue using her for sex? She wants to date other people and she damn well should because you’re clearly not interested. I hope she meets someone nice and mature that is willing to make a proper commitment to her. 
"I chopped off my mid back length hair in my early 20s during a brutally hot and sticky NYC summer to a chin length bob. I needed something manageable and professional for my corporate job. First thing my mother said when she saw me was  ""OMG, you're so ugly now!"" and then she burst into tears and kept going on and on how no man would want me and how all her friends would make fun of her for having such an ugly child. Then she wouldn't speak to me either.

Nevermind a) she had my long hair beautiful hair chopped off against my will to a boy short haircut when I was 8 and made fun of me when I was inconsolable and bawling for weeks. Apparently it was OK for her to do but not for me to to my own hair. b) I went to an amazing high end stylist and got stopped constantly on the streets of NYC with compliments and requests for the stylist's name and salon.  Even one of the C level executives at my company was so impressed with my hair cut she switched to this stylist, after having had flown out to California for YEARS to a celeb stylist out there that she trusted. "
It's actually patronising to men to say they're just clueless about how to behave in this scenario. No. Any normal and decent guy is going to be there at the hospital.
She's an idiot and also classless herself. Is she really that clueless or is she being intentionally hurtful? Think about it.
"*Looks at OP's update. * 

ಠ_ಠ well. Look. You're not the first and you won't be the last girl to have made the mistake. "
"I like my hair so much now that I don't think I'll grow it out anytime soon, but shamelessly taking this opportunity to ask: how to keep thin  hair healthy? There are lots of myths/contradictions ):"
Maybe your subconscious/gut instinct is speaking out? 
that what most people would do 
"Look, this isn't going to sound good but just being 100% honest: You reek of desperation here. And I'm sure he can smell that. It's not attractive in terms of being marriage material -- and it sounds like this isn't a good time for him period. You're disregarding his very intense and real feelings to soothe your desperation and it's not a good look. Honestly, keep going with the pressure -- on a timeline that is, quite frankly, unreasonable -- and he will likely think twice about marrying you in the long-term. I highly advise that you focus on working on yourself OP before worrying so much about getting a ring on your finger. "
"It depends on the nature of the trip... if it just for fun, sure, but family related, serious business, not so sure since you’d want your closest people"
"Thank you. 

“2\) Do you want to spend the rest of your life having virtually no sex with a partner who laughs at your suggestions while refusing to take any steps toward getting your needs met?”

Seeing it worded that way was a big eye opener for me just now. "

"I wonder - if a male friend of his had a panic attack, would OP be as likely to find them cuddled up in bed under a blanket, snuggling and stroking each other’s hair?"
"It's been three years of this. If this isn't how you want to spend your life, it's time to leave."
"Agreed. Crying everyday is a bad feeling. It’s a partnership, so tell him what’s wrong. If he doesn’t understand, then that might be a problem"
"America isn't exactly the safest place on earth to give birth in... Look at the stats, maternal mortality is increasing."
"No, but the usual things you save for as a family (childed or not) are home, retirement, and maybe travel. If she already owns a home in her twenties, I don't think your retirement is at risk. She's already shown herself to be a good steward. That being the case, why are you so opposed to her having something expensive for herself with her own money? She's further ahead contributing to your life together than most people *ever* get, so maybe you can just view this as her very expensive, you-don't-get-it-but-she's-earned-it hobby."
"I must spend too much time here, because that's immediately what I thought too.

Gonna go browse through r/aww to get my humanity back now..."
"Never heard of this before.. So ymmv.

My gut tells me its a boundary issue. If she's getting upset because she doesn't hear your reasoning behind your emotion.. In guessing there's some insecure degree of codependency coming from her.

I couldn't theorize in any depth because right now it looks so unfamiliar.

I'd suggest reading on schema therapy,finding out which maladaptive schemas you've got, especially which ones you have which could explain her wierd need for explanations from you. 

Perhaps your constantly pulling away in your relationship gave her a sense of security (as broken as that security was) and now with her needing to play an emotionally supportive role she feels out of her element and panicky when her rock shows emotions.

Really odd one.. Good luck mate!"
"It sounds like you're feeling neglected and jealous of the dogs and that's the real issue. Which is valid, but you need to talk to her about YOUR relationship, not her relationship to the dogs. That's going to obfuscate the issue when the real problem is that you feel she isn't putting enough work into your relationship."
He needs to be paying child support. Don't let him bounce around in your child's life. He needs to either be there or get out. It's too confusing and painful for your son's father to be there suddenly in his life and then suddenly gone again. 
"Yeah who needs a healthy, happy girlfriend if you have a 2.4 k a year collection of shit? "
"&gt; Even if these aren't your priorities, it's a pretty crappy joke to make.

Yeah, I'm serious. Hang out on this sub for like a day and see how many women write posts about their partners basically treating them like this. You insist the only thing you need is respect, and you make disrespectful jokes about the people you wish respected you."
"So cute. I have this pair of maroon vans and my boyfriend has a pair of high tops that are the same color. A few times I've seen him see me wearing my vans, and then come back a few minutes later, having changed into his own maroon vans to match. Freakin kills me"
"You seem to be a kind and reasonable person, so I don't think you are getting how Nice Guys like this work. Anything not explicitly negative is encouragement... and even explicitly negative stuff can be rationalised away. Hope springs eternal. 

I bet when you said ""love"", even though you literally meant nothing by it, he swooned. If he has not gotten the message after years, then he is somewhere just past denial.

I'm not sure the kindness of a woman can solve his problem, when it revolves around his inability to properly relate to the kindness of women.

Pull the pin. Abort. Eject. Exeunt. Exit stage left.

You aren't helping him. In fact the longer he is doing this kind of thing the less chance he has of fixing himself.

"That is a lot for just one person to take on. You should really talk to him about coming forward and talking to a professional. Tell him you're so worried and care about his life. Don't keep it to yourself, it will cause so much anxiety. "
"My friend went through this, she was the younger new women. The ex will get over it eventually but she will be bitter for awhile, stop telling her details of your plans that you’re going to pearl jam etc. Just ask if she can watch the kid that weekend. If she asks, say work or family crap. Her knowing your adventurous dates will make it worse and she doesn’t need to know . And if your not already make sure it’s only you communicating right now with your ex regarding your son , not the new gf. Eventually she’ll let it go but in the mean time don’t rub it in her face about ur fancy concert dates "
"Which is followed by That Therapist Is Dumb, Let's Go to A New One and repeat until he finds one that agrees with him. Or even worse, stay with one and insist they're wrong every time, and don't participate or give it a fair go, while saying OP's the problem."
"Why would not knowing why she’s sick be a red flag for pregnancy? The only symptoms of pregnancy she had was throwing up.

If someone made a joke about how finding out they were pregnant would make them throw up my first thought would not be that she was hiding a pregnancy from me."
"&gt; He's telling you where you are on his priority list 

This, he cares more about what his mother thinks than he does about this relationship. Period. "
Or possibly look at their social media and see if there are any comments obviously grieving.
"Which doesn’t at all change the fact he is aware you do not want children at all. He does not actually take you seriously or respect you as an equal. He thinks it’s funny you have ideas about what you want, that’s ridiculously patronizing."
"Yeah, there are important differences in what happens AFTER a person gets turned down by a friend. If a man asks his friend out and gets shitty when she says no and stops being her friend, then it can easily seem like he wasn't her friend to begin with and was just pretending. If he doesn't turn on her and still cares for her as a friend and their friendship continues, and not just towards repeated attempts in the future, then no, people generally don't call that creepy or manipulative.

\(But OP doesn't really seem interested in anyone challenging his views, he just wants easy tips on how to meet ladies rather than advice about his kinda toxic outlook.\)"
