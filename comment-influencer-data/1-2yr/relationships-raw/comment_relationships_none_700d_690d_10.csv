"Dump him. Don't give him a chance to apologize, he doesn't deserve it. "
In general yes. I’m way happier than I was when I worked in an office and was on a stable career path (I worked in HR for a year after I graduated college- didn’t include that in my post). I become unhappy when I start overthinking my family’s opinions.
"Even if you feel fine, counseling can help give you tools to move forward.  It's really helpful for processing and preparing for the future."
I think it's also that there's generally a pattern in the *type* of problems that come up when a 29-year-old starts dating a 19-year-old.  
"The sexuality thing is a red herring. If he was gay, this would be harassment. If he's straight, it's still harassment. Don't get sidetracked about the real issue here."
"My family is very important to me. My partner's family is very important to him.

I would never want a proposal to be in front of either of our families. It's a moment for us, not a show for them. 

Your only chance at redemption is to tell your partner that you now realise that you made a huge mistake in not considering his feelings, and ask him what he wants to do going forward. "
"There are threads on 4chan of guys who post pics of their gf sleeping naked. I guess it's somewhat common.

But no, you're not overacting. I'd have a serious discussion with your bf and really consider breaking up depending of his answer."
It doesn't seem surprising you lost him... He wanted your time and affection and you act like that's a bad thing. He deserves better.
"I think /u/watevv isn't advising you to remove it, but that facebook sometimes shuts down profile of deceased folks, or kicks out users who are not the deceased individual. You should archive it now just in case that happens, like for example if her parents or brother tries to contact Facebook to take control of the profile."
"I'm not jumping to ""he's abusive"" here, but this seems like a red flag. Could he be doing it on purpose to lower her self-esteem/make her insecure? Maybe he actually likes it when she's jealous? Super mean either way. "
"Knowing Swedish culture I would almost guarantee this is coming from his sister and not the groom. 

Swedes are very egalitarian and someone coming from another country would generally not be excluded like this. 

If this is a wedding of a very small group in a village church I might overlook it. Something tells me the groom’s side won’t be as limited as I think many Swedes would find it offensive. 

"
100%. She was her backup plan.
"If she goes from model to computer science, she'll be too successful in so many different ways! Gotta stop that. "
Drunk people don't decide to kill people when they drive but they are still held responsible despite their incapacitation and changed mindset. Food for thought   
A lot of people do discuss past sexual experiences and particularly their first time witht heir partner.
Maybe you're just so damn sexy that he can't get enough of you. Good for you. 
"I think what worries me almost moreso is that I think your girlfriend knew something like this might happen and exposed you to it anyway. She didn't act shocked and feel out about where that came from. She cried, so I'm thinking that she knew her son had these views and still chose to subject you to it. 

I'm sorry pal, that is horrible. I don't know what it's like buy I really hope it doesn't deeply harm you and you can move on with your life"
"This is my favorite movie of all time. I suggest you dress as Bill Pullman's character. Then you can be a suave WWII vet who is proud of his wife. Another entertaining guy character is the announcer for the games who got to say fun things because he was mimicking an announcer from that time. Then you can walk around saying, ""whoa docta!"" There's also Ira Lowenstein, who kept the league going. You can wear a three piece suit and get round glasses for that one. Super easy. "
"I was thinking the same thing!  ""It's so sad when families have to deal with the care of a highly disabled family member.""  But no!  She'd probably be better off if she got cut off and had to learn how to take care of herself, honestly."
"Unfortunately, you can't have that.  Honestly, he hasn't been your friend for a long time, he's been in love with you and wanting to be more.  I assume you haven't thought of him that way because you either don't find him attractive, or there is some way you are incompatible.  Mourn the loss of the friendship and start working on leaning on other friends."
"I would 100% be okay with that, we do have an extra room and her mom has expressed how the job she has is only to stay busy. That's going on the docket for tonight. "
"I think your husband is trying to help you as best he knows how. This would be rocky territory for the best of relationships. It seems like you trust him. Rely on that trust and open up to him. Let him know your feelings. He can't know how to help you if he doesn't know what you want and how you feel.

I would think that a counselor could help, for both of you. Maybe just to help air things out and help both of you to be clear about what is wanted and needed."
"You need to break up. Him and his daughter are a package deal. If you stay with him, you'd need to assume the role of a step-mother.

It was wrong of him to keep his daughter a secret, since it's a deal breaker for you."
"&gt;I am a career oriented person. It is what is really important to me.

What about what's important to *him*? "
"*Boy, Bye Boy, Bye*. You're so lucky and you don't even know it! Think of all the time you could've wasted on this jackass! If he treats you like that (I read your comment detailing a bit more on your relationship) at 7 months, think of *2 years*!

Go get your friends and cry it out if you need, or laugh it out even better! His sorry ass doesn't even deserve a tear from you, even though *I get it*, you were invested he was **not**, it hurts like a SOB.

You only ""went wrong"" complying with this asshat's absurd ways. Gurl, stay single for a while and love yoself! *(I sound so cool in my head)*

There's a lot of fucked up people out there, but don't let them fuck you up as well. Be strong, you deserve better and you're gonna *get* better."
"""I wanna see what it feels like on my own"" = ""I really want to fuck someone else but don't want to be labeled a cheater."""
"Yeah I like how the fact that she committed suicide in front of them was casually brushed over as ""passed away,"" just like the cheating was casually brushed over as ""overlapping relationships.""

I get the feeling there is some strong denial in this relationship as well. You both need some heavy-duty therapy"
"Occam's razor.

People do things and swear they haven't all the time.  

If she can't text/call him, how did she set up a coffee meeting?  



"
"I agree, but it would be my attempt to make peace with Jane. "
55 pounds is a lot man. That’s a significant amount of weight to gain in such a short amount of time. You should keep on doing you and maybe start thinking about moving on. 
"I struggle with this because while all your points are valid I hate the whole term of work spouse/wife/husband. Because what you're describing is just...being friends with someone. Bringing the term spouse into just seems so wholly unnecessary. 

The terms husband, wife and spouse imply a certain level of permanence. And it's not like the work ""relationship"" is going to carry or to another company or anything. 

I just don't get the appeal. "
You really went above and beyond allowing him back in your life AT ALL. He ghosted you after he started talking to his ex in the fist place. You are his second choice. Fuck that dude.
"Be prepared to follow through. He will likely try to call your bluff, so don't bluff. "
"&gt; What should I do? I am not sure who was right or who was wrong in this situation, and I really love her.

This is one of those things where it doesn't matter. Is she acting reasonably? Of course not, nobody does in the wake of being a victim of violence.

Just apologize anyway. ""I'm sorry that I was suspicious and less than supportive; I was just trying to understand what had happened. I want you to know that I'm here to support you."""
"Bluntly:  a lot of your GFs life is going to be difficult.  That's something she needs to learn to accommodate.

Sitting around the house feeling like she's in prison and waiting for you to do things for her isn't healthy, even if she's disabled."
"Idk in her text she could’ve at least said “wow we are sorry we never texted you sooner but this is what happened...” 

No apology is crap."
"""Talk dirty to me.""

[breathes in]

""*Feminism is cancer and women have more sexual options, paid-for dates, and expectations of marriage being profitable than compared to men.*"""
"&gt; a few months ago I said if it's not now then I'm never going to do it

So you couldn't wait another 3 months? I'm getting conflicting messages in this post because the quoted text indicates that you changed your mind or went down on the other side of the fence fairly recently but later you say that you've ""gotten used to not having kids"" for the last 5 years? Soooo when exactly did you make this life decision? I can kind of see what she's confused about if you've never really given a clear message up until this point. Maybe she does think you'll change your mind because you have been wishy washy in the past, up until very recently? Just some thoughts where she might be coming from.

Ultimately you should not have kids if you don't want to though. And you should tell her once and for all so if this is a dealbreaker for her she can move on with her own life if she so chooses."
"I wanted to be sure this was addressed. Do NOT set this ""level"" for renewed contact.  Your life will be a future hell if you do. At least 30 days panic attack free before you even CONSIDER contact. 


I would contact her family and tell them her move out date. She needs to move out before or on the date set. No more extra time! 


Stay strong. You are doing the hard thing the right way. May this pass quickly for you. "
"If I was mom in this situation, I'd stop letting dad step foot in my house. Goddamn. He doesn't live there. He can stand on the porch during exchanges if he's going to make an ass of himself. And accusing the mom of alienating the kids is not a conversation that should he happening where the kids can hear it. I hope he can wake up before he does even more damage to his relationship with OP."
"A lot of excuses without much effort. If you want out, leave. But if you want to salvage this, find ways for alone time to see if it alleviates the anxiety. Can you sometimes work from a cafe or something? I work from home and find that helps remove me from the house and it's just me. 

You say it feels like you lost your independent life. Well....yes and no. If you're going to be in a committed adult relationship long-term, it's going to progress. Part of commitment is building a life *together* but you'll go insane (and boring!) if you're not still independent. There is a balance, and if you love her you can still try to find it. It takes some self awareness and emotional maturity but I think you could do it. "
"Personally, I'm of the opinion that breaks aren't necessary - you either want to be with the person (and work on being with them) or you don't. And having those sorts of thoughts about needing a break after just 10 months, when this should still be the honeymoon period? I think you're better off without him, which it sounds like in your post you already know.

Going no contact is hard at first, but so much better in the long run. "
"And what happens if you don't make peace with Jane? You don't really need to get along with her, especially with her ridiculous demand. "
"&gt;He disagreed, told me it was an expression, said as a joke and he isn't going to ""walk on eggshells"" and change how he has always said things. 

Is he generally an insensitive asshole?"
Ps he’s not overwhelmed at all. How can he be when he’s not doing anything. You should stop making excuses for him 
You're thinking waaaaay too hard about this. What you're suggesting is a huge leap to take.
"Lol me too. I would have said 

""You're right. I got my nights mixed up. I'll give my other boyfriend a call later"""
"I don’t care how amazing you think the rest of your relationship is, He is abusing you! You really need to protect yourself. You did the right by removing your money just Incase things really get bad. You have to take care of yourself self first. What ever you do I hope it works for you and you’re safe. 
"
"Introversion isn't an excuse to be an asshole. Anxiety isn't a valid excuse to be a jerk. If I were your parents, I would have kicked him out already. Nobody is going to take full advantage of my generosity and make me uncomfortable in my own home. He's not going to change. Accept it or don't. Your parents much really love you to put up with this. You owe them."
"You ever notice how no one ever, say, goes out and robs a bank totally unexpectedly while drunk or high?  Or, say, suddenly wants to do a bunch of quadratic equations?

Nope, they go screw some good-looking person, and then claim to the wounded SO that ""This was so not me--it was the drugs!""

Odd how those drugs made them do something that was totally fun and felt wonderful.  Odd....almost as if...as if...the drugs or booze was just the excuse to do precisely what they wanted.  FOR HOURS!"
"Don't go into debt for a marriage that hasn't even happened yet.

See if there are any family rings that you could get resized or reset, which tends to be pretty cheap. Or buy her a $30 moissonite ring on Amazon and replace it with a more expensive version when you have the money. Or buy a ring with a coloured stone of some sort, which will be a lot cheaper, especially if you don't go looking for a specifically ""engagement ring"", which tends to bring a markup.

But I guess the bigger question is--do you actually want to marry her? Do you want to get engaged? Do you want to do that now? Because I don't see any indication that you actually want to marry her, just that she expects to get engaged."
It's well beyond harassment. Even without her essentially telling him to fuck right off every single time.
"If anyone ever mentions it you just laugh and say ""lol she is so bitter she got dumped she will say anything"" and then change the topic.

Getting defensive is not the way"
"Widower here. First off, sorry for your loss. 

I was with my wife for 37 years. She passed suddenly. I started dating five months in. Excuse me, but no one sent me a copy of ""Society's Rules on Grief and Moving Forward,""  authored by ""Never Been There."" And if they did, I'd burn it in front of them. See, I love my wife to this day and I honor her memory every day. But I wasn't going to sit at home alone forever watching ""Star Trek"" reruns. As it happened, I met a wonderful woman, also widowed and moved forward with my life. 

The next time anyone gives you grief about dating, ask them the following questions:

1. When did you start dating after YOUR spouse died? Note the dumbfounded looks...
2. Send me a calendar appointment with the date *YOU* think *I* should start dating and living again. More dumb looks...
3. Did my wife tell you she felt disrespected?

You have suffered the greatest loss that a person can endure and at a very young age. You deserve to live life and live it well, without judgement from anyone, more so from those who have not experienced a true slog through hell.  A year? For a widower, you're behind the curve by an average of six months. 

So go for it. You get one shot at this life. Do it. Don't let the self-righteous run your life. 

"
Her mom might be forcing her because her mom is bound by a custody agreement.
Yep. Chuck it in the fuck it bucket.
"&gt; Would my children hate Me for keeping such a secret from them?

This is *your* story, you can tell it whenever you're ready."
"I went through a similar situation 20 years ago and I went to my father with the intention of staying 6 months minimum.

At the end of those 6 months I was emotionally clear of the old relationship altogether, I would encourage you to do the same. 

If you don't change something nothing will change."
"Parenting class. The best you can afford. If she really wants things to change, she'll make time to understand why her kids are doing this and try to meet them where they are, instead of where she wants them to be. A three year old cannot be anything but a three year old. "
"I think 'I left him. It's over,' was probably exactly what he was asking about and wanted to hear? You're fine. Gentle hugs."
"The brother isn't older, they were twins."
Oh I like this. Especially considering she DID get an actual title promotion after our divorce...
"I'm wondering if this is a ""That's just how Sarah is"" situation, which would mean that she's done this kind of thing before only a lot more low-key."
"She isn't ready for an adult relationship if she refuses to work on herself

No adult comes out of childhood completely unscathed emotionally. Of course it's on a spectrum and most issues don't require a professional to sort out. In her case though, those issues are extreme and glaring and she's still not interested in fixing them. 

"
"Don't think of that money as lost. If you'd gone through with the wedding, you'd end up with an even greater depletion when you divorce, so it's the price you're paying to avoid that larger loss."
"My ex started out with pinching from the very beginning of our relationship just like OP. At about a year and a half I finally told him that if he kept fucking pinching me all the time and insisted on behaving like a child who couldn't listen when I told him to stop, that I would break up with him. That was when the pinching stopped and the emotional abuse began. "
"In case this is relevant, /r/exmuslim. 

Some sociology or anthropology classes mught help you contextualize this. Your oarents grew up under certain social structures. Having a hierarchy preserves the social order, even if at a price for those on the lower end of things. In the U.S., for example, some whites actually think that crime is caused by civil rights, by minorities thinking that they are as ""good"" as anybody. 

Also, if somebody has lived their whole life under certain strictures, they don't want to see somebody else suddenly have freedoms that were denied them because that would mean that their own deprivations were pointless. This explains why women from traditionally female oppressing societies visit the same oppression on the next generation. If you had lived your life behind a veil, or not permitted any ambition beyond marriage and childrearing, or with your genitals having been mutilated, and your daughter or granddaughter wants to have ambitions and sexual pleasures, then you are faced with the realization that you didnt have to live that way either, which is a bitter pill to swallow. 

All this does not help you in the short term, though. In the short term, to the extent that you are dependent on your family for housing and an education, you have to learn how to play along. Meanwhile you have to research how you could escape the house, finish your schooling, and live on your own on case you were faced with a life altering crisis, such as being pushed to take a ""vacation"" overseas or being threatened with being pulled out of school. 

I hope you are never forced to make a decision between uour famiky of origen and your fundamental freedom to get educated, earn your own living, marry your choice of partner or not marry at all, and whether or not to have children. 

However, you need to make a plans in case your family pushed you into a life altering choice that was unacceptable to you. "
"This is silly.  Clearly you should alternate Christmas year over year.  Family is only 3 hours from each other, so you can easily spend a few days over the post-Xmas week or NY with the other family.  

He is being an asshole.  The compromise is very clear, this year you both do Xmas with your folks, and NY with his.

The church thing is stupid too.  Refusing to take part in a 1 hour service that is a tradition of your family is unfairly stubborn.  He can sit there and have his own quiet reflection and enjoy the Xmas atmosphere.  But you can fight that battle another time."
"&gt; Even if he loves her, he doesn't know how to love with respect.

This is important. It doesn't have to escalate to abuse to be worth breaking up over. My little brother can be like this. I love him but man am I glad I don't live with him. That's too much emotional labor for a boyfriend, and he's getting too old for that anyways. "
"Buddy, you know you gotta leave."
"Wow... that must be really, really hard for you to see. 

I honestly think you need to say something. You're clearly seeing that this is repeat behavior and I think you're right about wanting attention. 

Unfortunately, while I'm generally good at this I have no idea *what* you should actually say. "
"LDR, wants an open relationship, is still into clubbing, ""you being stressed out by this is stressing me out"" aka she doesn't care about your feelings, and YOU'RE starting to feel like you're the one in the wrong despite everything...

I don't know man, this sounds pretty fucked overall. You sure it's worth salvaging?"
Dude....are you trying to be the bad guy in a Disney movie?
"&gt; if somebody has lived their whole life under certain strictures, they don't want to see somebody else suddenly have freedoms that were denied them because that would mean that their own deprivations were pointless. 

SO SO SO TRUE. Hence the ""hazing"" of the next generation."
I’ve been married 37 years and my husband has never said anything that vile to me. OP needs to cut her losses. 
"I am- for this woman, who fought death and is now being forced to watch as her son is sexually abused by a psychopath ""for her sake"". He made an executive decision about how to pay for his mother's care and seemingly doesn't care one bit about the tremendous psychological damage he is causing her.

"
He was a kid whose sister deliberately tried to hurt him and potentially ruin his college career.  
"I had similar situation go down long ago, and to this day people who never met the woman still ask me if I’ve heard anything from “Skankotron 5000.”

I won’t lie, it still feels good over a decade later."
"At that point I'd give my kid permission to look her right in her face and tell her to fuck right off. 

It's probably for the best I don't have kids 🙃"
"This is just something kids do.  I think everyone can remember calling a teacher, babysitter, or some other family member ""mom"".  It doesn't degrade their mom's position or their love for her.  

Just keep correcting them.  It doesn't have to be a big thing.  You can even turn it into a little game.  (""I'm not mommy, I'm shy shy!  Who are you?  Who is *insert pet, stuffed animal, their brother, some other noun*?!  Who am I?"")"
"I would encourage you to take some time to read about what a woman physically goes through when she's pregnant. It's more than just having a large belly. Literally everything changes to accommodate this tiny human growing inside of her, and more often than not those changes are uncomfortable at best. Once you've gotten an idea of how much discomfort your wife might be in, ask yourself if, under those same circumstances, you'd want to be intimate.

It's also possible your wife might be uncomfortable with her body changing; it's her first child, and understandably some of these changes might be frightening, or might be negatively impacting her self-esteem. If she's feeling down on how she looks, there's a possibility that she might be avoiding intimacy with you not only because she feels unwell, but because she might worry that you've stopped finding her attractive because her body has changed. 

If you haven't already, you might want to have a discussion with your wife - not about sex, but just to check in and see how she's doing. I wouldn't be surprised if she's tried to keep whatever discomfort or concerns she has private. 

It's normal to be bummed because of having less sex than you're used to. Whether or not you're a bad husband is determined by how you respond to this. Will you make this all about *your* hurt feelings, *your* disappointment, and how hard it is for *you*... or consider your wife's reasons for not prioritizing sex during a pregnancy? Keep in mind that you have it easy right now - you're not the one who's pregnant."
"Do it op!  Do it do it

Man wish I was friends with you so I could click the like button.  Lol... make her feel even worse when your post gets 3000 likes "
"Fucking thank you. I feel like I'm going insane reading half this shit. 

""b-but what about how the child sex offender feels!?"" I swear to God this stuff gets more ridiculous by the minute."
I think the u/TKCerbs means how do you know the child is your husband's? That's not clear in your original post.
"So she gave her a kid's shitty makeup palette?  I wouldn't put that kind of thing on my face and would be pissed to get that as a gift from an adult.  I'd rather not get a gift than get a passive aggressive one like that.  Sounds like your sister keeps trying to put your wife in ""her place"" by forcing her into the role of little sister to a mean, controlling older sister.

I think you need to go to counseling, by yourself and with your wife.  You need to start defending your wife, and yourself, and stop normalizing/accepting your sister's behavior.  If you and your wife were united you could deal with your sister, but you're not so your wife has to protect herself from her sister while you're simultaneously letting her down.

Also you belong in r/justnofamily with this shit and truthfully it wouldn't surprise me if your wife was in r/justnoso.  I know you're trying to keep the peace but your sister is a hateful person and you excuse her behavior."
"&gt; Literally his account had 0 pics when he messaged me. I almost didn’t even talk to him because I thought it was so odd.

&gt;So I said to him “okay well then can I have your phone passcode?” And he told me I can’t.

So he had a burner account for trying to pick up Instagram girls, and now you can't see his phone - he *definitely* doesn't still have throw-away Insta accounts that he's hitting on girls with, that would just be *crazy* because he doesn't use these things you know. 
"
Couldn't have put it better than this
"Is she jumpin' around all nimbly bimbly from tree to tree? Drinking milk from a saucer? Eating mice? 

But to be serious meow, that is definitely not normal and would weird me out for sure. But if you think it's kinda hot then hey no harm no foul...

"This is the real question. If it's, say $1000, then that changes things."
"Joining local clubs for shared interests is a great way to make like-minded friends, and they tend to weed out insufferable assholes like your ""friend"" too. People say good things about Bumble BFF too!"
"&gt; He has asked all of us to try to set him up

Cool but that's not really your responsibility. It's nice of you to try and help him out but you shouldn't feel the need to bend over backwards on his account."
"This is totally a valid interpretation if he'd hadn't thrown a tantrum at her and ghosted her when she didn't capitulate. Also if he's whining to his friends that he's sad instead of reflecting on what went wrong, it does not speak of emotional maturity.  I myself have an abundance of feelings and follow poets on social media, so it's not like I'm some no-nonsense type-I'm sympathetic to these things! Your bottom line about OP needing to put him behind her and move on its completely correct though, regardless of whether he's being childish or perfectly normal in his response to the breakup."
"It sounds like your wife has been really unhappy for a long time, and the fact that you didn't notice is even worse. What have you been doing to try and bring romance back into your relationship?"
Congrats on your wonderful husband OP!
"&gt;that I could find one that pays “like just as much money” that’s relating to my career choice

This guy sounds like Lucille Bluth thinking a banana costs $10. I'm a well-paid engineer who has already got a degree, and I don't even gross $500 in a day at the office, much less bring that much home. No way are you going to find part-time work in your field as an intern that pays that much. Not only is he a condescending ass, he's completely out of touch. "
Backbone. You need one.
I'd also warn your friends and family and her
"What a nice dude.

Now go get laid (after a slow and steady courting process) sistah!"
Especially for 2-3 hours after school. The kid is just 2 years from driving... I'm sure he can handle hanging out with his sister at home.
"&gt; It sounds like he purposely looked for an excuse to make that comment. 

This is exactly what it sounds like.  So either he is just a massive shit for brains, OR, he thought it was some weird, super-nice thing to tell this girl.  Like he legit thought how special it was that he could get a prettier girl, but he really loves this average girl so much.  "
"It doesnt work like that. You cant have your friend back.

You have two options: 1) trying a relationship with him or 2) not seeing him anymore."
"I feel you. I’m a ginge and while love my hair I wanted to have that phase in college where I’d dye my hair just to have something different for once. I’ve had salon stylists outright refuse to color it.

Tell her it’s hair and it grows back. If it ends up looking terrible, at least you’ll be able to laugh about it later.  

Btw don’t forget to color your brows to match.

I have noticed ginger guys tend to wear a beard really well, if you do decide to keep it or go back to natural."
"If anyone is to leave then it has to be him.  You did nothing wrong.  If you are going to break up over this, and I recommend that you do, then he has to be the one to leave and find new accommodation until the divorce is finalized. "
"You're getting downvoted for implying that getting groped in your sleep is only considered sexual assault because of bizarre modern fancies, and not because it's actually sexual assault."
"This is actually not true; according to the New York Times, men who fight for primary physical custody in contested divorces get it about 50% of the time.  

I advise the OP to fight like hell, because he will most likely win."
"Why are you with someone who doesn't love you for YOU versus your money? WTF girl?  He is the most shallow of bad boyfriends.  You deserve way better than this guy, and it really wouldn't take much searching to find it..."
"Either he shuts his mouth out you shut your legs. 

His choice. "

That is extremely unprofessional."
"Take screenshots of everything.
Tell your uncle explicitly, ""This is inappropriate and disgusting. I'm your niece. Don't ever speak to me like this again.""
Block him from all social media.

"Right, I am stlll deciding. A lot of people are saying the molly doesn't matter and that she fully decided to cheat, but that isn't really how that works. Of COURSE the molly and alcohol changes your decision making. It is a huge factor here. If she did this sober I would break up with her without any question. 

I've done some shit I seriously regret on molly and don't hold myself to those things. I know it can make you do stuff that you don't even think about the consequences, especially sexual stuff. That doesn't mean I completely forgive her for this, but I know its a big factor here. "
"yup. entertaining comment, but bad advice."
"&gt;I would speak with the teacher directly. 

How would you bring it up? It's kind of an awkward thing to discuss.

&gt;If the teacher is a man it may be safe to assume that he did not think that girls, at the age of 10, would be dressing provocatively. 

I agree that it probably wasn't on his mind. It wasn't on my mind either at first. And I don't know if they will be dressing ""provocatively"" per se, just with more of an emphasis on looks than there otherwise would be. (Of course it's difficult to judge as an adult.)

&gt;Maybe the teacher is assuming that the parents of 10 year olds will have a hand in the purchasing and choosing of the costume and therefore the costumes would all be parent-approved? 

From what I heard from my daughter they were planning on choosing something that was borderline appropriate and then ""altering"" their costumes a bit right before the contest."
"&gt;didn't know he had a child until I was already falling for him. 

Hey! Being in love with somebody is not a good reason to stay with them. I spent years of my life with the wrong guys because ""but I love him"" and it's one of my biggest regrets.

You cannot let your feelings keep you in situations that are ultimately not working. Yes, it's unpleasant and you will hurt for a while. But you will heal and be better off for it in the end.

You have nothing to gain by sticking around any longer. Best to just rip off that plaster and get it over with.

"I was also a swimmer, and wore contacts every day. I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to, but I'll be damned if I'm going to be blind while at practice or anytime I don't have goggles on."
"I don't know if you can recover your relationship from this mess. You were thinking rationally and logically but this is a traumatic event for your gf. You didn't react with enough compassion and tact. I would find this difficult to forgive to be honest. The only thing you can do is apologise. It's not about who is right and who is wrong. Your girlfriend went through somethjng traumatic and your concern is whether she's lying and who's ""right"". I don't think you should get back with her. Stay away and give her space to recover. She deserves someone who will be there to support her through this and you don't seem like you could be that person. "
"&gt; ""You have never made effort in our relationship. With the ring, I wanted you to step up for once for me.""

I mean, no, she shouldn't say that, but it doesn't sound like it's too far off from what's actually going on. He spent several years stringing her along and half-assedly pretending to commit to her while banging other women. They've since settled down and he's apparently struggling with the concept of ""don't eat all the food because your girlfriend is a person who eats too"", and thinks that *helping her mother set the table* is some kind of romantic household contribution worth noting.

He sounds like the epitome of the ""But I did a thing! Why aren't you jumping for joy?!"" guy."
"This guy's behavior isn't because he's an introvert--it's because he's a dick.

I'm definitely introverted.  My husband is eve more so than I am.  He hates people and going out.  But he has never once, in six years, stopped me from going out--he rarely comes along, but he does not stop me or bother me from hanging out with my sister or friends if I ever want to.

It ultimately wouldn't be an issue if he didn't want to participate in outings--but not letting her participate?  That's a problem.  "
"Oh I definitely spoke to the ex-husband and he was even more furious than me - they'd only been married less than a year after being together for like 8 years. He said she just got really quiet around the time Daryl left me, then stopped talking to him entirely, then left him in a LETTER."
"But you see that's having your cake and eating it too.  Either he is socially dumb enough to give a platonic co-worker jewelry or he is socially dumb enough to give a sexual co-worker jewelry in front of his wife and all the office ppl.  If both solutions rely on social daftness then both are equally probable.

How much does he make, that's the real question.  If he makes over 80K a year then its totally possible he said ""Objective - Gift for female co-worker.""  Walked into a mall, saw the clothes stores, said ""Do not know how to pick women's clothes."", saw a jewelry store and said ""Women like jewelry.""  Walked in, saw a mid-lower range necklace for 200 bucks and went ""Mission accomplished.  Next home depot for a new shovel."""
"I think you're being a wee bit crazy, tbh. Who cares what they do? You're not dating them, you're dating your boyfriend. "
"I agree with that. It was a big parenting decision for him to take into his own hands.

That said... It sounds like OP's son's inexperience was becoming a source of anxiety for him. The fact that he lost his virginity to someone patient and kind is a good thing. And now, if he starts talking with a girl he really likes, he won't have to worry so much about figuring out how to disclose his virginity, or how to have sex. 

Obviously this warrants a serious conversation with OP's husband about respect and making big decisions as a team. But I highly doubt the experience harmed OP's son, and it sounds like it might have helped him feel more open about sex and sexuality. 

I'd do two things for OP's son: 1) get him screened for STIs now and in a few months, and 2) tell him he can always talk to you about this kind of thing.

Good luck."
"Hell, just pretend to spank him and teach him how to fake cry.  This is not your job, and it could make your brother dislike you when he grows older.  She can't just sublet her dirty work out to another kid.  What a horrible woman."
"Yeah this has definitely gone beyond minor. It's escalated to the stage where his go to response is to hurt OP to try and get his way, scary and unhealthy.

Plus all the ordering around and undermining her shows a lack of respect. It really comes across as he feels he can lord it over OP and just get her to do what he wants. Plus thinks he just just treat her and her body however he wants. 

Don't put up with it OP! I'd leave as it's getting worse."
Please please please see if there is something HR can do. This situation is so predatory and vomit inducing.

For the record, if my husband went to jail for selling drugs, he'd be getting divorce papers his first day there, and I and the kids would be moved out by the time he got out. And he'd get court-supervised visitation, at best. "
"I had to sign into my throwaway account to post this because my boyfriend knows my main.

I'm going to get downvoted for this because reddit is very anti-cheating, but I am currently dating a guy who has cheated in the past. We have been dating for a year and everything has been wonderful, we have a great relationship.

My boyfriend was very open about his cheating to me. He blamed himself the entire time, he went to therapy (before we met/dated), he answered all my questions, and even told me if I ever want to bring it up again -- that he would answer my questions. In other words, if I ever feel uncomfortable or want to talk about it, he'd be willing to answer everything.

Now, your boyfriend doesn't seem to blame himself or accept responsibility for his actions. He seems to pass it off as a normal thing (my boyfriend thinks cheating is not normal). He seems so nonchalant about his cheating that I guarantee that he has not taken responsibility for it and more or less has not received serious consequences over it.

I am more shocked at how he is lax about his cheating. This is not how he should act. He is a grown man, not taking responsibility for his actions. 

If I were you, I would leave."
"Google the words “Captain Awkward missing stair” and you’ll find a great resource with advice. It’s meant more for social groups, especially among geeky types, but a lot of it is applicable to your family as well. Your family knows that it’s weird. They also know that you’re more reasonable than your brother, so they’re putting it on you to change because he won’t and they don’t want to deal with it."
"Based on all your comments and your post, you don't sound poly - you sound like a monogamous person who's trying to force herself logically to be poly because you think you won't get a man if you don't let him sleep around. You have all these logical reasons, and yet, when it comes down to it, you don't want to sleep with other people, you don't want him to, and he doesn't want you to. This isn't poly - it's a monogamous relationship where he's trying to cheat.

It's 10000% reasonable and normal to be monogamous. You don't have to be the ""cool girl"" and you're very wrong that all men are unsatisfied with one woman. Don't let your boyfriend convince you otherwise, because that's a lie designed to push your boundaries beyond what makes you comfortable.

You don't want your man to sleep around. You don't want to sleep around. Why are you forcing a relationship that you don't want? Just find someone whose values match yours, rather than tearing yourself to shreds forcing yourself to change them for no reason."
"Well your coworker needs to know that his wife his being a sack of dirt. Really? I've been in your kids' position when I was much younger, around 5 or 6, and never told my parents since I was too young to understand just how much I was being taken advantage of. However, I resented it with every fiber of my tiny being and if I had told my parents and they didn't do anything about it, for the sake of being ""nice,"" I probably would have resented them just as much. They're your kids and you should be old enough to just be honest about it and tell him, from one adult to another, that you don't want to be part of this anymore, and why."
"Why is she such a colossal uncompromising arse in your ""best case"" scenario?

Maybe it'll go more like:

Best case: Her: ""Oh, I didn't realise this was so significant to you, babe. I'm sorry. I'll try to figure something else out for my friend BECAUSE WE HAVE LITERALLY TWO MONTHS TO FIGURE THIS OUT, or maybe she can come with, or just stay there without me."""
So you are telling us she does not know how to put an entry in her phone's calendar to remind her of important dates?
"I think some people don't realize that what may seem like a small issue in a relationship, is actually indicative of a larger problem. Those of us who have experienced more, and repeatedly ignored ""small"" issues that kept coming up and ended up destroying the relationship years later, see them for the red flags they are - hence why so often the advice given is to ""break up"". We've been there. 

When you're in love, it's easy to underestimate those ""small"" issues, or think it would be ridiculous to break up over them... when you'd actually both be better off. But when you're in love, you don't want to give up so easily.

Long term you yourself need to create some sort of family/support system for yourself aside from her because when shit hits the fan for you she is not going to be able to help you.  Everyone will have major life events, cancer, hurricane, fire, surgery death of a spouse etc and needs a support system.  You are living dangerously without one. "
"See, that's what OP's ex should be modeling her relationships after. She's trying to claim poly (and disrespecting those who really are) to defend her cheating.

"&gt;  I'll see my bf this weekend and if I'm still feeling this terrible I will talk it through with him.

I don't want to push more responsibility onto you after a horrible ordeal, and your first priority is to do whatever you have to do to take care of yourself.

But I want to double down on encouraging you to tell people: your boyfriend, and your female friends.  Other guys in the group.  There are many reasons for this but the big ones are these:

1) Your female friends *need* to know this guy is dangerous. 

2) You remove fear of this ass-hat telling your boyfriend by telling him yourself. If your boyfriend is a stand-up guy, he'll support you. 

Part of ending rape culture is sending strong messages to guys that this behavior can not be tolerated. He need to realize that crossing boundaries with you has hurt him, socially - other women won't want to be with him - and hopefully your boyfriend will make clear than good men don't tolerate that shit among their friends.  Real social consequences can teach this guy better behavior. 

You don't have to ask people to ostracize him or anything like that, but I think giving your social group a chance to stand up and put a small dent in rape culture is a good thing. 

Obviously, like I said, take care of yourself, first. Ending rape culture isn't your responsibility. But if something like this happened to a friend of mine - even if it was perpetrated *by* another friend of mine - I'd want to know, and I think/hope that some of the men in your social group will be allies, as well.

"He should still get tested and then tested again in 3-6 months. Condom's don't prevent every transmissible STD since they don't cover everything on a man and also if he didn't use one during the lead up to sex. Plus, it's a good idea to get him in the habit of getting them when having sex with a new partner or ONS, because college."
"At this stage it sounds like the only decent option.
If this doesn't work, then he's too disconnected from reality (or too connected?) and this will likely cause many more hardships in the future."
"Thank you! That's the issue! I've told them that *if* I did go back to her it would be purely because I feel sorry for her. Which I do, I do feel bad that she's going through all this since she just did not see it coming for some reason. But, she should have considering that most of our conversations where fights, and I never lied to her. She knew how unhappy I was with her. "
"They ditched you so the guilt you were smeared with wouldn't come off on them, even though as you say, they personally knew the allegations to be false.  In other words, you got dropped because that was the popular thing to do.

The apology isn't for you, it's for them.  I'd send a no contact notice to them, anything further gets a restraining order."

"I suspect your wife is terrified that if she adjusts her schedule she'll face the ""mommy penalty."" I could be wrong, but if that's her fear it's a very real thing that happens to women who try to fit their careers to their parenting duties and not the other way around. If this is the case, I can see why she both refuses to cut back her schedule, and also has trouble emotionally accepting that this comes at the cost of a close bond with her children. She wants it both ways, and that's just not how our society is set up to function right now. "

"Wow. You never should have said that.

And honestly, it's a shitty opinion to have anyhow. You clearly have never known anybody who had to be a lifelong caretaker of someone with severe Downs. My aunt has a 28 year old, 6'4"" son with severe downs who can't care for himself, wears diapers (but he can take them off) and frequently shits all over the place. He's too strong for her to control a lot of the time and he's put her in the hospital several times. 

I wouldn't say wanting to avoid the possibility of that life is selfish. And if you judge people for wanting to avoid it, it reveals a lot about your character."
She isn't willing to put effort into herself or the relationship. She deflects or makes excuses when problems are brought up and most of all She cheated on you and you emotionally cheated on her. Even though this was years ago it sounds like this relationship is pretty far gone. Couples counselling may be a start but as far as the Weight goes the only solution is for her to decide she wants to do it. If she doesn't you are out of luck. You can decide whether you can live with that or not. I know I would have been considering divorce a while ago. If you aren't happy maybe you should too.

"Yeah I'm surprised his initial reaction wasn't just to laugh right into her face and go ""are you shitting me?"" You shouldn't have to be there to *monitor* his interactions and behavior. He shouldn't even be going in the first place IMO, if he had any shred of respect for you. 

I'd tell him that I was strongly against this and list my reasons why, and then follow through and dump him if he actually went to the party. This is just an ultimate sign of disrespect. It sounds like he enjoyed the attention of having girls fight over him. Truly shitty. Everyone likes attention but the fact that he's comfortable hurting you just to get an ego stroke is a massive red flag. 

I could NEVER imagine doing anything like that to my partner. You should really reconsider this relationship if he actually plans on/goes to this party. This is a dump-worthy offense of massive proportions."
Yuck! That just made me feel icky...and I'm not even in the situation.
"Maybe she was in a shitty place emotionally when she decided to tell your then-boyfriend about your infidelity, and later to ask him out?

"Life will always have stresses. A good partner does not take out their stress, fear and worry on the other. 

I'm so sorry you are in this situation, but you're making excuses for his bad behavior. I get it, when people are in this type of situation they are so psychologically twisted that they can't get a good perspective.  

He will not change unless he wants to. He does not want to. Nothing (trust me I've been there) NOTHING you can do will make him not be abusive. In fact, he will most likely ramp up his abuse until you will end up hurt or possibly dead. I'm so sorry to be so harsh but please please try to understand that you didn't cause this and you can't fix it. "
"Except he's not trying to explain anything to her - he's trying to force contact when she's told him exactly what she wants. No means no. Period. He needs to respect her wishes and stay out of her life unless she decides to let him in. 

This is like dealing with an abusive ex - just because someone is a family member does that mean they should get a free pass to be a jerk to someone."

I finished the first paragraph and didn't need to go on, my partner knew exactly what her reaction would be and that this guy is clueless enough to not realize why she's upset. 

Because this is not about Star Wars.

This is about her being excited to share something she loves with her boyfriend and the jackass not giving a shit about her feelings. Just sit through the second half of the game, dude. It means a lot to her.

If this is how he approaches sex I feel super, super bad for this woman.

"Well. He told you it wouldn't work out, and here you are, things not working out. He said it would be a death sentence to your relationship and you convinced him to give it a try. I'm sure he was aware that he would be reacting in a very bad way to all of this and he has. You book a trip with your friends and him for the few days you have together, you leave the country and convinced him to be ok with it. He feels left behind, and you kind of did leave him behind. You're young and you do you, but I'm not surprised things turned out like this from what you're writing. Sometimes you actually got to choose what is more important, your relationship or your career, this is one of those times. Think things through and come to a decision. There's bo right or wrong decision but there will have to be one. "
"I mean yeah she's being completely unreasonable, but it's totally lame for your engaged friends to exclude yours and Linda's partners.

"&gt;He shouts that he f'n hates my mom and then starts repeating loudly, ""Did your mom tell you what you did was wrong?!"" as he chases me through the house. I try to lock myself in a bedroom to get away from him. He grabs the door and tries to block me from shutting the door. (Something he does in every fight.. or if I successfully get the door shut he breaks in..or if I have tried to leave he physically restrains me from leaving the house) 

This is terrifying. This is not normal. Your husband chases you through the house like a predator and routinely breaks down doors to get at you during fights.

This is not acceptable. This is not necessary. You do not need to live like this.

He is beyond controlling, he's far into the territory of abusive and terrifying. Loving, compassionate adults don't treat each other this way in relationships.

I have never had to run from my husband. He has never restrained me physically. I have never had to hid from him behind a closed door or call the police. He has never made me quit working or attempted to take my savings.

Please, please, please get a lawyer and get a divorce and stay safe and never be alone with this person again."

It sounds like his behavior has been pretty normal and he's being browbeaten into thinking that doing anything she doesn't like is a betrayal.

If the cell phone company won't remove the charge (and I'm guessing they will, or at least reduce it), then off to split the charge with your cousin, since there is split fault here."

"You seem like you know your shit. I have a similar problem. My best friend happens to be a girl, and my gf happens to hate her. We’re in a ldr so they never met. I pretty much stopped talking to my friend because my gf wanted me to (her ex fiance of 5 years cheated and she openly admits that she doesn’t fully trust me). An example for what happens if i do talk to her: On my birthday last december i was with my gf, we were at a bar, and I went to the bathroom so i gave her my phone to play with (hers was out of battery). she went through my texts and calls and saw a 1 minute call from said friend one week earlier, that i forgot to tell her about. she caused a big scene and i had to apologize lots. 
this hasnt really been a problem since march since i’m on the other side of the world for work rn, but i will be going back home in 5 weeks and i guess it will start again then. 
is this normal? she has guy friends, if that changes anything. thx "
I like this the best. If I was in OP's position I would take my sweet sweet time finding a new job as well. 
"Thats awful. Did you just cut her directly out or inform her when she was sober? 

I've had to cut out a long time friend this year - it's such a wrench in some ways even if you know it's for the best"
"Think about then...your MIL wants a full bar at a wedding for her family...and she wants your parents to pay for it.  Your MIL wants to throw the party of her choosing and have someone else foot (part of) the bill.  You need to shut this down, it's out of control.  "
"To further avoid human contact at Starbucks, place your order via their app ahead of time so you can walk in, pass the line of shmucks, fetch your order at the pickup/web order counter, and feel the stares of a hundred eyeballs on your ball as you smugly walk out. "
"Jabberwocky is spot on. If this mess is dragging up stuff you have long since dealt with, that is harmful to you, you owe it to yourself to shut that shit down.

They say that blood is thicker than water and that is fine on paper. Toxic family is still toxic. You need to keep that at a distance (like Jabberwocky and I have had to do)."
"&gt; He gets upset in response to all of it, and has told me many times: ""I'm a grown man and I can eat what I want. So what? It's my favorite food, it's cheap, and I don't force you to eat it."" 

Sounds like he gets defensive."
"He’s told you exactly who he is and what he wants but you’re not listening to him. 

I’m not the type of person who can do an open relationship either, so I get where you’re coming from wanting monogamy. But you need to pick your partners better, and it starts with listening to them when they tell you what kind of relationship they want and are willing to have. "
"Hi OP, I am going to respond as someone who’s stepmother died of a brain tumour, so I get how it feels to have a parental figure suffering from cancer and the trauma it leads to.

I am going to say I understand and agree with your sister, and here is why. You and your sister have just experienced probably the first true realisation that your parents are mortal and will die some day. That is a very, very difficult thing to confront and accept. Cancer is a very scary and horrible thing to happen to a family member, and the worry is often that it will return. Your dad is just recovering from it and your sister (and yourself) is probably still dealing with the emotional fallout. It is therefore understandable she wants a family-only vacation where you can sit round and make nice memories and just enjoy your family as it’s healing. Because as much as you might see your girlfriend as your family, she ISN’T your sister’s family, and she is therefore not part of the true experience of your dad having cancer. I understand and appreciate that your gf may have supported you through the terrible time, but it is a different role than one of being actively involved in the trauma and supporting the whole family. She is therefore not an active participant in this healing process for your whole family, even if she is part of YOUR healing process, and I think it’s completely reasonable actually for your sister to not want her to come, especially if they don’t get on well (unless other SOs are attending, in which case that is hypocritical). Another aspect is that your gf is not yet a stable family member i.e. long term wife, and maybe your gf doesn’t want her there because if you break up, she will look back and think, ‘I have this lovely memory of my most beloved nuclear family... oh and random xxxx was there too.’ That doesn’t mean she can never be included in any family memories ever, but your family is going through a really hard time right now and you need to appreciate that you need some real bonding, healing time with them. Your gf being there is just kind of an ‘extra’ which will be uncomfortable if your sister wants to address how hard it has been dealing with your fathers ilness, as even if she says she understands she doesn’t REALLY get it becaue she can’t.

Idk, just my 2 cents but had my stepmother lived longer than 5 months after her cancer diagnosis and we had had the chance to take a vacation to celebrate after as a family, I would not have wanted my sibling’s SOs there either."
"&gt; My girlfriend thinks my best friend is in love with me

Ask her why she feels that way. Come at this with an open mind, rather than defensiveness.

&gt; We used to play a lot on online video games together but now it is like 1 time a week.

Keep track of how often you do ""fun stuff"" with this girl vs. your girlfriend."
"Dating in your 30's is excruciating, but you have to keep trying.  Figure out what exactly is getting you down about it.  Maybe you need to open up on dates sooner, and talk more about yourself, your thoughts on life, etc..  That's typically been my [38m] problem.  I also feel similar when visiting my biological family, as I'm not married and most of my cousins (all younger) are.  But I did find a girlfriend last year, and I'm happy with the relationship.  In the weeks leading up to our first date, I was next-to-hopeless that it would happen.

You write well, you seem polite.. it's surprising you don't have at least one guy clinging to you.  You just have to keep getting out of the house, swiping through the dating profiles when you're home, and doing things on your own that you enjoy.  The more often you get out, the sooner you'll meet the right guy.

Good luck."
"She’s lying. People don’t walk around talking about how they aren’t jealous. And she says those other things to demean you. DO NOT put up with it. She has low self esteem and she is making it your fault. Hey, you’re pretty great, so it’s not a surprise she’s jealous. Maybe tell her the next time it happens that you love her and you want her to be happy, but she isn’t going to be happy by insulting you. You could also tell your dad that he shouldn’t play favorites. That’s bad parenting. "
"Depending on the relationship, I'd handle it this way or with a ""Shit, sorry man, I didn't mean to slight you, just wanted something new. Want to grab coffee this week and talk about that BS call?"" Gives them an apology that doesn't invite them to shame you or be offended further and continues the friendship outside of the home so you can push to stop spending time with the kids."
Dump her and buy that car. 
"Idk if I would say BF sounds douchey. I mean, sure, he has clearly misinterpreted but he hasn’t been controlling himself or anything. He has misunderstood and is trying to stand up for his GF. I think sometime we forget that each person has their own experiences that impact the forming of their opinions and actions. Idk what happened in boyfriends past to take this so seriously but maybe his mom was controlled by his dad or whatever and he is extra sensitive to it. OP needs to talk to her brother, tell him BF has taken it seriously and that brother needs to knock off the hilarious joking and explain it was just a joke. Communication is always the solution when the problem is a miscommunication."
"I have been assaulted mid-relationship. My boyfriends first words out of his mouth ""why were you with him? were you cheating"" 

an instant mental burning occured in my head. I, like your girlfriend, could not believe that he would instead of support me, question me.
I left him. And I am glad I did. 

Because an assault is so incredibly traumatizing, yeah she's going to either have delayed telling you for legitimate, trauma related reasons or fudged the date for legitimate, trauma  related reasons.

Here's what you should do if you wish to continue your relationship: Apologize. Tell her you are so sorry she has gone through this. Do not ask her questions. Do not even insinuate that you do not trust her.

If you are not ready to forgive the minor detail of the lie about the time, stay gone. She deserves someone else. Not you.

I am saying this with direct experience of this exact situation.  

Needing to ""build trust"" is going to heap more anger, resentment and shame on top of somehthing that you not only did not support her through, but doubted her.

And don't mention the STD's. Trust me buddy. Don't do it. Go get tested yourself if you're so worried. 

You cannot approach this from logic and rationality.

She is fucking wrecked in her mind right now from this awful, awful trauma. For you to tell her you want her to get tested (especially if she's already left you, she doesn't want to hear about YOUR SEXUAL concerns. she is more concerned with how much of an ass you are being *in her eyes*). is to indicate ""hey, I know you went through this awful betrayal of violence, fear and shame, and then I doubted you and questioned you instead of supporting you, but I think you are filthy and diseased""


Man, If i was her I would leave you too.


and dude, nobody lies about this type of thing.
Maybe one in a million girls for attention, but those are the type of girls who are so incredibly dramatic and deranged, you would know in an instant it is just more of the usual crazy shit.


That is the WORST POSSIBLE INSULT to someone who has been assaulted or raped, that they are possibly just covering up cheating.

That is FUCKED UP and don't ever say that to her, or you'll lose her forever. it's FUCKED UP."
"God we're weird animals. 

Please induce this negative feedback loop in this other individual to accordingly adjust their behavior to a more desirable state.

I completely see where you're coming from, I just, I'm fascinated by us sometimes."
"Well what are the months like where you don't make enough have you saved the extra money to help support those bad months. 
Are your finances shared? These factors are kinda important info to know."
"&gt; So my advice is even though Jenna didn't do anything wrong, it would be completely understandable if you want to get some distance from her while you process everything

This is what I came to say. Even though its not Jenna's fault, OP shouldn't feel pressured to process this with her or anyone else."
"He definitely will not take it as seriously if you use another person as an excuse and will most likely continue to try to contact you, maybe even outside of work, because in his head he'll see your boyfriend/boss as the only obstacle separating you two, not the actual reason which is him being inappropiate. Don't be afraid to be assertive. Don't be afraid to stand your ground. Don't be afraid not to please everyone, certainly not a man who's willing to cheat on his wife. Someone suggested the grey rock method and that sounds like a good start."
"Does it matter?

They probably went to the JOP earlier and cheaper for some practical reason, like health insurance.

Honestly, it isn't really any of your business, they had their reasons, they're adults, this is their life.

It sounds super narcissistic of you to even think it had anything to do with you or your wife. It doesn't. It literally doesn't matter at all, it was *a decade ago*.

Let it go."
"I wouldn't add details, but I would let them know that she made the decision not to contact them when she knew she was terminal, and that you will uphold and respect her decision to have no contact with them now that she's gone. Ask them to respect her wishes and leave her in peace. And then block them.

These are the instructions I have in place for my NC family, and I would not wish my bereaved chosen family to have to deal with them any further than that after I was gone. "
"&gt; Well I can love her and not be completely straight

Of course, but she told you that she doesn't want to be with someone who's bisexual. It's a dealbreaker to her.

&gt; But I love her and that's kind of dominating my mind right now

If you really loved her, you wouldn't have cheated in the beginning of the honeymoon period."
"Agreed. You didn't even ask for the tickets. Even if he wanted to surprise you with something nice, he shouldn't have felt the need to reveal the cost because he would have known that would make you feel guilty. He wanted you to feel like you owed him something in exchange, exemplified by the fact that he's currently holding this over your head.

My boyfriend never lets me see the check when we go out for dinner, never holds the amount he's paying over my head, or accuses me of using him for money. He pays because he wants to genuinely do something kind for me, not because he expects anything--physical or monetary--in return. 

From my perspective, the guy you're seeing is exhibiting manipulative behaviors and he's either going to ghost you if you don't have sex with him or, if you do, become increasingly more manipulative. "
"You **never** tell them the source of your information.  You simply tell them you know what they did, and that they should make a full confession or you are done on the spot."
"This all sounds awfully suspicious.  There has to be something he's not telling you, and chances are it has nothing to do with you.  Because if you did something wrong he wouldn't have been so happy during the last trip or so excited initially about this trip.  So something unexpected happened and he has a difficult time telling you.

I wouldn't worry about it too much until you actually figure out what the reason is. If he doesn't want you to go, you can't force your way in.  And don't worry so much about the perception of being uninvited.  It's no one else's business and your bigger issue is the why.  

In terms of how to get to the bottom of this, the best way is probably just to ask him.  You've asked him several times by now I'm sure, and he has given you some really retarded reasons.  So call him out on it.  Sit him down and tell him his reasons are silly and that you want an honest answer.  Tell him this is a big deal to you and that the least he could do is tell you why.  See what he says.  But know that if he keeps his mouth shut, there isn't much you can do about it."
"I never really respond to things like this, mostly because some of the things I would say have already been said but I agree 100%. She needs to live with her actions and you (op) need to move on with your life. It's quite unfortunate that your sister is still on her side seemingly (by asking op to reconcile) but honestly her mental issues sound like a personal problem at this point, and as someone else mentioned her friends should be going to her family and not include you in this mess. "
"in all fairness, she probably hasn’t forgotten. totally moved on, yes, but not forgotten.

If i were you, i would phrase an email or facebook message in a way that is zero percent justify/explain and 100 percent apology. you’d probably do well if it is along the lines of

-i hurt you by doing x, y, and z
-my problems with a, b, and c caused you undue burden and there’s no excuse for it
-i know it’s been quite a long time, but i wanted to reach out to you and give you the apology you deserve
-i am not asking or hoping for anything in return from you, i just wanted to say how sorry i am for the way i treated you, and i wish you the best in spite of my actions 4 years ago. 

include NOTHING involving “i’ve fixed a, b, and c and am such a better person today”. don’t make ANY of it about you. that’s how you’ll come across the most sincere."
"Remaining fertile is not the problem. The risk of many different issues is much higher for men over 35. It's basic biology. I'm just saying, I know it's not what your post was about but I was very surprised. "
"Like women, men have other erogenous zones. Woo him. Seduce him. Have a makeout session without making it sexual (unless *he* lead it there). Give him a backrub. Take the man to dinner and focus on the emotional intimacy. Up your game. After a while, the comfort and familiarity people in relationships have often leads to people taking shortcuts, and groping is one of those. Additionally, it's easy to feel objectified, and no one likes that. "
You guys are gonna be miserable if you stay together. Just miserable. 
You're looking for excuses to let her off the hook. Molly doesn't make you cheat. You should know this. 
Susie deserves to be kicked out on her ass. I don't know whether she's en entitled and disrespectful princess or just completely clueless but leaving trash with used sanitary napkins in a shared room is just gross and she was given ample opportunity to do something about it. Deliberately hiding it under the bed was the last straw. Your mother has been accommodating enough.
"You have already planned that your wedding ceremony will be in a Catholic Church though, and you are communicating that to him, so yeah it does sound a little like you are sitting there talking about your ceremony plans. 

Also, of course it is more than fine for you to expect that your wedding will be in the Church or whatever deal breaker you have, but some people can come off rather rigid and demanding when they discuss such things. It's just a matter of approach. I'm kind of picturing him sitting there listening to you talk about this, and in my imagination, he's a more lenient person but at the same time maybe a little floored that such specifics about your wedding are being thrown at him, and then he makes his comment. 

I mean, maybe you should give the guy a break. At any rate, yeah like others are saying if there is so much distance in a relatively simple exchange, maybe you two are incompatible. Don't know for sure. Maybe give us an update on this one. "
"Yup, this happened to me when I went to college too. I am from a very conservative family, and college was like waking up from being brain-washed my whole life. 

It definitely led to tension and fights. I went through a long period of being ashamed of them. Stressed out over how they treated everyone who wasn't them. And how they might treat me. 

In the end I moved away. It was a good excuse to go low contact with them. Their view still embarrass me, and being with them in public is stressful. One of my sisters acts like they do, and I don't have any contact with her at all. Thankfully, my youngest is starting to see through their BS and I feel hopeful about that. 

You can try to get them to come around, but I didn't have any luck. It sounds like you have extended family who also feel this way. It will be even harder because of them. Good luck, but don't be afraid to take a step back to protect yourself. "
Your entire second paragraph is condescending af. Why are you with this woman when you feel so vastly superior to her? 
"&gt;I didn't say anything really

oh for god's sake TELL HER WITH WORDS

This is wholly fixable, dont suffer in silence"
"Tell your mom, ""That condo does not have enough room for two people. If you would like sister to stay in the condo, thats fine. But I will find other living arrangements."" 

Also, point out that if sister is living with you, thats still not living alone. 

Maybe also talk to your sister about her expectations about living with you. Does she expect you to cook, clean, etc? Because you would expect the same from her as any roomate- that she cooks her own foods, cleans up after herself regularly, etc. Give some examples. ""For example, the 30 empty shampoo bottles you currently have in the bathroom would not fly."" Also point out that since she will essentially be in the living room, she will have to keep her space very tidy and clean. "
"&gt; Which, anyone would take silence as a confirmation that ""Haha, I get to jerk off AND you're still here, what a fucking loser you are.""

Or it's ""I'm making a sacrifice by not jerking off to porn for you, and you're still confronting me about it a year later, this doesn't dignify a response in the middle of an argument.""

&gt; I begged him to be honest so I could leave knowing I'm a big, ugly idiot and just move on and be a hermit. 

Okay say that he has a few times. He could a) lie, b) tell you yes he has a few times and have you go full on panic attack about it and have you assume all that negative stuff even though he doesn't hold that opinion or c) stay silent. Not a good position to be stuck in.

You seem to have an incredibly negative view of yourself and seem to be projecting your own opinions of yourself and assuming that your boyfriend holds those same opinions. Also assuming reasons for his behavior which as far as I can tell from what you've written are unconfirmed. "
I was thinking this too.  She’d probably drop off her baby and some dirty laundry with your son.
"Please consider his feelings for a quick second before making this about how you lost your best friend. Yes, it sucks, but imagine if it was you. You've confessed your feelings to them but they don't reciprocate. Be honest. Would you feel comfortable around them? 

He needs this time to be by himself, away from you. He needs to get over you. There's a chance that one day you can regain that friendship again, but following him around because you lost your BFF is not the way to fast forward this process."
"I definitely get the impression that either she really wants an open relationship (or has found a potential candidate for herself), or also perhaps that she's somehow concerned that she's not enough for you (does she have low self esteem/depression/anxiety/etc or anything else that could cause her to view herself negatively?)

I wouldn't break up immediately, but I would hold off the wedding until you get to the bottom of this.

Talk to her. Ask her why she keeps bringing it up, and where this is coming from."
"Not to mention that if a photo of yours is reported, you're notified that it was removed and warned not to do it again. If OP didn't get that notification to his actual account, it was to either a fake account or it never happened (which I think is likely)."
"Respectfully, OP, you aren't insensitive, you're effing clueless. Your wife is now imagining that you've told the entire office extremely graphic stories about face-fucking, anal and threesomes. She's never going to another office Christmas party or function of any kind again. 

Why on earth are you telling everyone about your sex life? No one wants to know. Most men don't talk about their wives like that. Most guys stop sharing intimate details after high school, or college at the latest."
"I think this is it.  She's been married for six years and probably worn her ring every day.  Some people place more value on some symbols than other symbols.  To her, the ring is a symbol of his love for her.  By him spending six years not wearing it 8 / 10 hours a day, that's disrespecting their love. 

She is being unreasonable in a way, but this is a situation where she needs to sit down and analyze it for a hot second, and come to the middle ground.  Also, he should look into a silicone ring as other people have said. 

And he needs to say to her, not ""BUT I COULD DIE"" because that isn't helpful.  What he needs to say is that he understands it is a symbol of their love to her, and he wears it all the rest of the time for that reason, and assure her that if it was safe for him to do, he would wear it. 

It's a communication issue.  Not a ring issue."
"Please all of you block her. I had a girl do similar things to me...she had done it before and is still doing it to others. It is unreal and gets downright terrifying. In my case, this girl escalated into stalking each time she moved to a new obsession with a new person."
"Talk to a family law attorney and have them lay out your options. I don't know how you not being married will affect a custody case, but the lawyer will. They'll also have advice about precisely how to extricate yourself while putting yourself in the best position to get custody of your daughter. 

Also, because you don't mention it but I'm concerned, is your GF's son ever violent? Would he hurt his little sister? If you're even unsure, don't wait for her to be weened to start this process. Honestly, since you know you're done mentally, I'd be making the appointment with the lawyer tomorrow. "
"Got it. I can see where that could be hard for his grandmother and may explain where some of this odd behavior is coming from, but obviously you shouldn't try to force a child to be interested in hearing about his deceased mother. 

Your husband could try telling the grandmother that you are going to make sure that her daughter is remembered. Explain that your stepson isn't fully capable of listening to and grasping stories about her yet and that you don't want to force him before he's ready."
"You're miserable with her, she refuses to change and she cheated.

I say end it. 

Go and be happy dude."
"I would warn against her reporting it until she is lawyered up, because there are many instances of this happening, the university taking the side of the professor and torpedoing the students career. She needs to make sure she has everything she wants from the school before going down this path, because admins are usually not going to try to protect her "
"throughout this post, you mentioned the importance of logic and almost put down the importance of emotions. Try those on for size next time. Realize that this is an emotional experience for her, and you don't necessarily have to agree, but it's important to recognize her emotions of the situation, instead of her lack of ""logic"" in the situation. 

I also just kind of wanted to mention this, as an aside, but as a woman in science, I'm told constantly that women are less ""logical"" than men. If the way you talked to her is the same way you wrote this post, I'd be pretty damn frustrated too. I pride myself on my ability to have emotions and be a real person, while also being able to use logic. It's not binary like that. I just wanted to say that since it came up a couple times in the post. "
It's so creepy that one of your friends posted here 17 minutes ago wondering how best to tell you that IT'S CREEPY.
"Honestly, it’s time to set up a safety net. Find daycare, see if your job will let you come back. You are in a very dangerous position right now. He’s being controlling beyond reason and it’s only a matter of time before he starts controlling money since it’s “his”. "
"Don't make it about getting her ""back on track"", because it comes across as you saying there's something wrong with her.

It won't."
"She has 3 kids by 3 different men and LC has never met her father because he's been in jail some before she was born. She's got a decent job, but she relies on everyone to watch her kids for her and she's constantly in everyone else's business because she's extremely immature. For example, she's taken her 2nd baby daddy to court at least 5 times because of petty things like he got a new girlfriend, he got tax money back, he bought a ""new to him"" truck for $1800... It's insane.

I think she purposely creates drama so she can put the blame on others. And the reason she isn't allowed in the house without my uncle being there is because she beat up his wife a few years ago after the wife suggested my cousin stop sleeping with random men and having kids she doesn't take care of."
"Honestly, if she can’t give you closer. Give it to yourself. Collect the rest of her belongings. Take a picture that you’re leaving it all at her mothers home and every thing. Give yourself time to heal because what she has done is not only unfair to you. It’s childish as fuck. She basically did you a favor and removed herself. 


Good luck in future relationships, OP. You’ll be ok. "
"I was a horse kid too, and the worst thing you could have done to me at that age was to restrict my horse time, cut my lessons, etc...."
"I'd agree with you if the problem wasn't ongoing. I mean, forgiving your dad for something like this is one thing. Having him say, essentially, forgive-me-now-and-on-my-schedule-or-I-won't-pay-for-uni just gouges that wound open again - and then again, with the I'll-cut-you-out-of-my-will spiel. And again and again and again over 8 years, as it seems to be.

The irony is if he'd shut his mouth and kept his head down at the time and given OP time to come to him of her own accord, their relationship might now be better. But he's spent 8 years continuing to dig that hole... I reckon if someone bothered me this way for 8 years I might be angry still too. "
"No 50 year old men dating 20 something year olds are 

"
"Wow. This soared right past grieving son behavior and directly into asshole territory.

Has he always had these anger issues? 

I am speaking as a professional doormat and emotional punching bag (my dad died last year and none of my brothers handled it well. They would snap and say really shitty things, directed at me because they were grieving and I was a safe person to be angry at). THIS IS NOT NORMAL.

This is so concerning that he is not only unwilling to consider your feelings, at all, but is actively trying to hurt you (""riding your ass"", you crying when he's being an asshole is what makes him the asshole not his behavior, etc). I also have a toddler and would absolutely refuse to raise my girl in a situation where she thinks that men treating women like this is normal.

You need to do what is best for you and your daughter. If your husband is absolutely unwilling to go to therapy to work through his grief, you need to leave. It is not safe for you, there.

I'm so sorry."
"This. OP's girlfriend wants out SO badly, without the guilt. This is 100% because of the new guy, but honestly, if they've been together for so long, if it wasn't this guy, it'd be another.
 I agree, if someone wants to go, you let them go. You should never have to **BEG** someone to be in your life. I know most of us who have experienced heartbreak have felt this way; we're all susceptible to it. But when you have to beg someone to be in your life, they really don't want to be in your life."
"I would not bring her flowers or a note. A handwritten note is only providing written documentation of your fuck-up (which you should likely avoid) and flowers are an extravagant display. Others may wonder why you are giving flowers. Again, for the sake of keeping your job, you should fly under the radar as much as possible for this. As it is, it is possible someone else may report this.  

I would sit with her and apologize face to face. Tell her that what you said was absolutely unprofessional and uncalled for and you have no clue where it came from. In all honesty, your relationship may never be the same and that is probably for the best.

And, one last thing, I am a teacher so let me tell you this, no matter how close you are with a co-worker, do NOT carry this over to the students. It is one thing to crack jokes amongst adults, but it should never include students, especially ones that are too young to really understand humor."
"It's not realistic for you to expect that you can make a strong, uncompromising, and highly symbolic statement about your relationship to a family member on one hand, and that you shouldn't be the subject of that same family's negative attention and judgements on the other.  

If you're just looking for someone to tell you you're justified to not like Toby - sure, a stranger on the internet who doesn't really know or care thinks you can do whatever you like.  But if the opinions of extended family are important to you, that should have entered into the calculus when you decided to exclude Toby in the first place."
So he got mad that you didn’t want to have sex? 
Exactly. It wasn't a surprise to anyone that OP and his wife were coming. Why didn't the sister or OP's parent's plan the sleeping arrangements a little bit better?
"Urgh, cone on.  He's old enough to be your Dad and you're surprised he's manipulating you? 

I worry that parents aren't doing their jobs whenI are posts like this. Did your mother not inform you about what a man twice your age wants? 

"
"Sounds like she's trying to pay you back for your generosity. Write her a lovely thank you note expressing how sweet it is, how lucky you are to have her in the family &amp; how lucky the little ones are to have her as an aunt. 

Then put a joke in like next time we'll have spending limits though- or we'll all be declaring bankruptcy by Christmas.

Not a bad problem to have! Enjoy the products &amp; your lovely SIL."
Raise your hand if you hated Joe by the 3rd paragraph. 🙋‍♀️
"That definitely has crossed my mind in the past. Ive been so pissed off before that I told my mom I would call the cops if he did that again. She had to calm me down and tell me we will talk to him, which of course never goes anywhere with him. But next time he brings him home late or takes off without asking, I may just have to use this threat on him instead of just saying it to my mother. "
"I was expecting a Cersei and Jaime joke, so thank goodness it wasn't that -- imagine how he'd read into *that.*"
"My husband is capable of full conversations while still not actually awake, I've actually had to rescue him once as he'd answered the phone to his manager and was talking absolute bollocks. It was after a night shift but he got teased quite a bit on his next work day."
"It seems to me that you could be dealing with a bad case of postpartum depression and that is making you perceive your marriage and overall situation as horrible when it's really just normal issues that go with a new baby entering the mix. 

My advice is to make an appointment with your OBGYN and see if he or she sees your situation that way. "
"When I was that age, I really, really loved sitting with one of my parents and a photo album and going through all of the pictures. It was like reading a picture book, but I got stories about real people and all the cool stuff they did. I think if you took some of your SO's photos and told the kid stories about your and his dad's life while going through them, it would be a nice way to involve his birth mom and any other deceased relatives you feel are a good role model or you have some good memories to tell him about.

He didn't get to know his birth mom so it's unlikely for him to feel like he would if he remembered her dying, but she's his birth mom and if she was a good person, I think he should know stories about her, stuff she liked and stuff she did.

It has nothing to do with you not being able to replace his mom. I totally believe you love this kid as if he was your own and he feels the same about you. This is just something he should know about to understand his background. If you wait until he starts asking about her, then you're risking it will cause all of you some trouble when he'll be going through his puberty if it takes him too long to get curious.

Absolutely don't frame it as something he has to be sad about.

Aside from that, grandma has mental health issues. Hoarding doesn't have to include cocroaches to be a serious problem. It would be nice for her to get some professional help and maybe a grief support group, but she'll have to want to go. Do you have other contacts in grandma's biological family you could ask to help you with getting help for grandma? She'd probably listen more to them, I'm afraid."
And OP was risking her utilities getting cut off and not being able to eat until the end of the month. That’s a concern too.
"I actually *dated* someone with the same first name as my monster. It gets worse: my abuaer was legally my cousin, so he has the same name as I do. When I first started dating my ex and posted something on his Facebook wall, seei g my last name lign up with his first name made me cry. I almost broke up with him over it. So yeah, that collection of sounds can very well harm you, like any trigger can. 

OP, you just have to choose to not *let* it harm you. I don't know if you are religious or believe in the ways of the universe or anything, but it helped me immensely to just see the irony in the situation and treat it like a joke. The *person* who harmed me can no longer harm me, I grew stronger than that. Only my *memory* of him does. So I saw my boyfriend's name as a challenge. A way to redefine that name, to not thonk ""rapist"" but ""partner"" when I heard it.

If therapy is something that works for you, I would definitely go talk to someone about it. They will be able to help you overcome this negative connotation. What helped me personally is Google all the good ""Tom""s there were. And I kept telling myself, a name is just a name. The memories that name dig up, I can replace with better memories. And it's true, when I hear ""Tom"" now, I think of my ex first, no longer my abuser.

If you want to appeal to your granddaughter and tell her the story, go ahead. I wouldn't, personally, because telling her this opens up the wounds again and makes it a new problem for her to deal with rather than an old one I already dealt with. And she may very well keep the name or ise it as his middle name, and you will have to overcome it anyway."
"It's not clear how much communicating you guys are doing. I get the feeling it's zero. 


You *are* being needy, and that's ok! Because one of the reasons we have partners is so our needs can get met. We need companionship and love and cuddles and affection and all that jazz. 


So first thing is don't let her out walls up to conversation by deflecting the issues. She calls you needy as a way of stopping the discussion because you more than likely back down. 


""Yes, I am needy. If that means I want an affectionate relationship and interaction from my wife. When you say things like that I feel like you're trying to deflect and not address what I'm actually saying. """
"How was the professor supposed to know that ""from his experience"" was from an event that traumatized him and was from his tours overseas if your friend didn't say it? 

Sure, she was harsh but this isn't worth going to to the dean over. She has no idea your friend was in Afghanistan and this is where his near death experience is from. He didn't tell her. Her being so harsh about it is for a few reasons.

1) Sure, she might encourage discussion and say there are no wrong answers but its pretty frustrating and annoying as shit when you cite a study in class and people raise their hands, with anecdotal evidence, to dispute what you are teaching with their personal story. Its sorta like saying ""I know you studied this subject for hundreds of hours, and wrote a thesis or a dissertation on it (depending on if they are a Professor or an Instructor) but fuck all your studying and hard work. Fuck all the work of your colleagues who did this study. I have a story to tell to prove your ass wrong."" Whenever I teach classes in my given field and profession and someone wants to chime in with an experience they had that disputes what I'm teaching I always ask them if we can discuss it after the class is over. 

2) The professor isn't a mind reader and isn't going to be able to know that being harsh towards your veteran friend is going to trigger him somehow. Considering the amount of topics that exist these days that can trigger people its a wonder anyone discusses anything. If we lived in this society where you couldn't talk about, be harsh to, or disagree with people without triggering them we would never talk. I'm sure me talking about how awesome it was to be a father when I became one could have triggered someone who lost a child in a tragic incident. Does that mean I never get to talk about becoming a father?

"
"tell your mom *everything* - tell her about the dress. tell your mom and your sister about the theft. tell your school about the cheating and the bullying. don't be afraid to defend yourself should she actually try to hurt you (don't go too far, but enough to stop her from hurting you. you're stronger than she is don't let her harm you just cos she's a girl)

bullies get away with this crap because good people don't speak up. all you need to do is be honest - but if you can get her on camera threatening you all the better"
"My parents would respond with, ""ok we are charging you $200 rent as of now"" "
Does he have a degree? It sounds like he's trying to take credit for your work to make up for his own lameness. 
You should go see a professional to deal with your insecurities because this sort of thinking can have a tendency to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"It honestly doesn't sound like she was that bothered. Adults have sex. You have sex. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. Of your that embarrassed end the relationship, it's ultimately your choice. "
 Every single woman had been demeaned by a man at some point in her life. Whether be him trying to take credit for her work to more serious stuff like assault. It sucks that it is part and parcel of being a woman. That's why it's important to speak out when it happens. 
"This is perfect, OP. It's just apologetic enough to smooth over hurt feelings without making yourself out to be super-guilty, and it clearly explains the problem without assigning blame. It also sounds casual enough that it doesn't come off as cold and weird(considering this is a cousin you have a decent relationship with, some of the other replies sounds a bit too stiff)."
"&gt;  I have called her out on previous shitty behavior before that was much more deliberate to use me or others. 

And yet you're somehow surprised that she pulled another stunt?  Come on.  And just because she didn't write it on the invitation doesn't mean she didn't talk it up differently to people in person.  She promised you a cake and then served it to other people in front of you.  That's pretty malicious.  "
"THIS ^ OP I guarantee the only reason you saw tears was because she was afraid her meal ticket was going to divorce her, and then the world would know what a horrible human being she truly is: a liar and a cheater. Its really not that hard for a woman to break down in tears, sorry.

How are you sure she hasn't been seeing this guy, or other guys for weeks? months or even years? I find it incredibly hard to believe that you were gone for 1 week and in that course of time she got horny enough to download tinder, create a profile, upload pics, create a bio, start swiping, then match, then message the guy(s), then arrange to meet. **What'd she wait a whole 24 hours after you left to download tinder??? Seriously dude! Wake-up!!** What happens when you have to leave for business again? you're constantly going to be stressing. What if you have to leave for two weeks at a time? What is she going to do, get ""horny and lonely again?"" maybe this time she'll have time to bang three randos instead of just one...."
"The implication is that what happened to OP is partially OP’s fault because she picked “shitty friends”. It’s another way of saying “If you hadn’t done X, then Y wouldn’t have happened”. It’s victim blaming. "
"As a guy with a few of these I will offer my 2 cents. Leave it as a one night stand, don't go chasing after him and abandon your trip. That won't end well. Finish what you came to do in India and maybe offer to meet him somewhere in the future without any expectations. If you're over the moon with this guys and thinking about him everyday after a one night stand then your expectations are going to be way higher and he will never meet them. If you cross paths with him in the future and things turn out then great. However you need to be understanding that they could also not work out. Food for thought"
"My dad also died about five months before my wedding. I was crushed. I remember asking my grandma who’d walk me down the aisle, and she burst into tears. “Not again.” Mom has asked the same thing when her dad (and grandmas husband) died shortly before her wedding too. 

It was definitely a big empty hole in our ceremony"
"Aaron doesn't need a key to your home. He doesn't need to be involved in your son's morning routine anymore. I'd wager he's crossing all these boundaries now because he senses / knows that Luke's becoming more independent and you need him less. That's true.

He doesn't need to spend all this time with Luke. It's way too much, more than most any 7 year old spends with any adult. "
"I agree, the fact that she basically lied to hopefully make you feel bad about saying no is very manipulative.  How much more manipulation would be in store for you?  Has she shown the trait before?  

If you decide to say no, I would make it clear the deciding factor was that she lied about it.  "
"He's a 31 year old man who's mooching off of a 21 year old woman. This guy knows exactly what he's doing and if he can't figure his shit out at his age, it isn't your problem. "
"Firstly, I'm sorry for your loss, OP.

Still, what's happened between you and Racheal is something you both engaged in. You're both in somewhat of a vulnerable place at the loss of a loved one and sometimes that causes people to make mistakes.

Telling yourself that you're the scum of the earth and that you'll never forgive yourself for it is a pathway to misery, and misery alone. I think you should try at least having a conversation with Racheal about this, as well as bringing it up with a counselor."
Even the greatest glass of wine is made undrinkable with the tiniest amount of dog shit in it. Your relationship has more than a tiny amount of dog shit.
"Being similar in personality and interests doesn't mean you'd make a good romantic match. A lot of a successful relationship is being complimentary, not being identical. 

If your boyfriend is happy with you, you don't have to worry about introducing him to your friend."
"&gt;(I do knows he works 60-80 hours a week though. so if he has time for that + me + some other girl that’d be impressive). 

I know that you're highly invested in this so I won't bother trying to discuss your relationship itself any more, but seriously - a Lawyer who picks up girls half his age through social media and is both jealous *and* hypocritically demands privacy is basically the ""likely to cheat"" checklist.  "
"When my boyfriend used to grab my boobs, smack my ass, or just randomly go for my crotch as a means of trying to turn me on, it did the opposite; it turned me off and annoyed me. It made me feel like he was saying ""Gimme, gimme, mine, mine!"" instead of taking his time to create a mood, or like he thought the only sexy parts of my body were the...well, the sex parts. Our sex life went way down since he would then get frustrated when grabbing me all over didn't make my clothes magically come off. However, we worked through it and now our sex life is amazing! 

Now, there might be times where you're both just horny and want to go at it without building up the mood first, but it sounds like he would prefer you work slowly up to grabbing his junk. Groping him that way might have seemed exciting and fun at first, but now he just feels like a piece of meat or like you're saying ""Gimme!"" 

Don't grab his crotch or his butt unless you've already warmed up with some making out, a little naughty talk, et cetera, *which he is responding to*. Take the time to make the mood. "
Reimbursement definitely needs to happen. 
"Okay I appreciate that he told you but personally knowing my boyfriend was spending a night hanging out with prostitutes doing hardcore drugs would be 100% unacceptable and I would end the relationship over that if he refuses to stop going.

The being around naked sex workers and touching them is insanely disrespectful. The drugs are illegal - what happens if he goes to jail? What if you have kids?

I think he clearly doesn't realise how awful it is to most people, which is very difficult. 

Please don't be dazzled by the fact that he's successful... so what?

You sound like a decent normal person. Can you stay in this if he insists on going to these gatherings? What matters more to him: hookers and  blow twice a year, or you? He can see his friends another time, or ideally make new ones!!"
"Um, you may have anxiety issues outside of this (me too, not trying to minimize), but if you're having anxiety over your BF doing this to you, that's not mental illness anxiety, that's your brain operating normally and it's telling you that this guy and his actions are completely messed up."
Maybe her own shitty behavior is why she gets barred from people's houses 
"Yeah it sounds like she took your concerned, hears them, and was honest back with you. She comforted you and honestly her logic (this friend being trustworthy) makes sense. Unless you really think you can't deal with this, I think you should just trust her. Find something else to do and just take your mind off it. "
"This. if it was one photo, maybe, but hundreds? This is something deliberate that he planned and repeated over and over, repeatedly violating OP's trust and privacy, and no doubt getting off on both as well as the images themselves. Delete photos, then delete boyfriend."
"Yessssss. ""I know how much you looove animals, so I donated the $1000 I had budgeted for your gift to the save the cows from the leather factory foundation."" "
"Seriously OP, I've worked in several doctors offices and people letting shit like this slide horrifies me. Don't feel bad at all, because you'd feel far worse if what she did got someone sick (or worse). If she wants to do sloppy work she can find another field, because you can't afford to do that here. "
So have bridesmen!  I've seen mixed wedding parties.  It's not that odd.
"You're not overreacting. With that said, if you're so tired that you're absentmindedly grabbing things and taking them with you (and your story is hilarious and harmless), maybe get a good night's sleep before you deep dive into this with him. No point in getting even more aggravated before you've gotten caught up on your rest."
An awful kind of person. One who doesn’t really give a damn about anyone but himself. 
He hates kissing and he hates vaginae. He sounds like a *spectacular* lover.
"Yeah, my husband and I got our rings tattooed too. I'm a chef, he's an electrician. It just makes sense not to wear a ring on our hands and also tattoos are just kinda freaking cool."
Would you believe me if I told you she totaled her first car because she was talking on the phone about the new curtains she got?
"I'm from a similar cultural background to you and I have to say, your parents' objections to his age are less ""strict Arab parent nonsense"" and more ""rational parental concern."" I have to wonder why a man in his mid 30s decided to go for someone so young and sheltered.

You need to experience independence in order to truly have healthy relationships. Your parents (much like mine) stunted your growth by not allowing you to have normal teenage experiences and you need to find yourself now.

&gt; looking after me like a real man would

This part makes it sound like you're still stuck in your parents' ideas of how relationships should work. A ""real man"" is not just someone who finances you. You should look for a relationship where you're both equals, you shouldn't expect a man to look after you."
Thanks. I think I’m just going to tell her no and leave it at that. 
^^ This is why I read the comments.....
"&gt; Also i am a little bit affraid that she will burn the house. (Yes she is capable of everything when she is mad

I wanna know more about her rage"
"Without the context of you being deaf you handing people your phone can be seen as more personal than speaking, but it's not as if you took her phone to do that, so I think you aren't being creepy.

She either doesn't realize you're really deaf, or she's just not worth your attention. If you were being polite and didn't overstep any other boundaries (touching, for example), then just unfriend this woman on facebook and go on as if nothing happened."
"Uh, you don't live there so you *really* don't need to go sticking your nose where it doesn't belong, making things possibly difficult for your boyfriend with his roommate."
"I don't find this bizarre, I used to LOVE going to Grandma's once a week or even more, well into my teens. Granted, it was a lot like a personal heaven with more or less no communication + infinite food + infinite games, and idk what OPs grandparents house is like.

Kids generally aren't left alone just willy-nilly, even at 13. That's honestly prime ""I'm going to do stupid shit and burn the house down"" age, and like everyone else pointed out it seems like this is the parents time to reconnect. He should go hang out with friends or spend the night at a friend's house if it bothers him, but being alone in a house is a privilege that comes with adulthood."
Can you shed some more light on the age difference between you two? I can't imagine having the life experience to get married at 22 and I certainly don't think I'd want to be with someone half my age no matter where in life I am.
It almost seemed to me like he was fishing for ways to stoke his own ego. That alone isn't abuse just a real asshole move. 
"&gt;on another note, I think you are seriously overreacting about the gift.

Could not disagree more. Tom is a manipulative creep, and this ""gift"" is 100% intended to be emotional loan sharking so that he can escape the natural consequences of being obnoxious in his friend group. OP is totally right to not want to accept this gift or the rope-size strings that come attached with it."
Hope he has fun at his dad's 
"&gt; Immediately Alex and I clicked and became friends

Jon fears that this is going to progress until you start cheating on him with Alex. I worry about that too.

Jon sees the future, and that future is ""I dumped my friends for this girl, and this is how she repays me.""

Is Jon uneasy about all male acquaintances, or just Alex?"
Can I ask: what's so great about him that you've put up with this bullshit for three years? When did he start freaking out and being abusive about your romantic history?
"If I'm laughing and touching someone we are likely very intimate. However everyone is different, him touching her knee while he's laughing does sound intimate to me. 
 
Why is this woman even invited to these events if she is so disrespectful as to flirt with her brother in-law?"
"Gotta agree. She basically decided that his dreams mattered less than her comfort, and lied so she could make that happen."
"Of course she feels like what she thinks doesn’t matter. It didn’t matter what she thought of your relationship until YOU decided to put labels on it. It doesn’t matter that she tries to tell you that she needs food too, because YOU’RE hungry and thus eat all of it. Like, it seems like you started putting in effort really recently (and oh boy, you’ve got some ways to go), but you didn’t really communicate, and you don’t really listen to her/know her enough to determine what she wanted (judging from the post, she wanted to be an active participant in picking out a ring and got sad when she realized that she wouldn’t be included in the process). To her, this is probably just another instance of not feeling heard.

I wouldn’t say break up, but I do think you need to work on your communication. Talk to her openly, show genuine interest in her opinions and be honest about your thoughts and feelings. Also, stop eating all the food and realize that your gf is a human who needs sustenance, and maybe apologize for stringing her along for years before comitting."
"This is so far the only advice that seems actionable. I am, again, rather private and this all new territory for me. Thank you for thinking outside the box."
"Wtf? Why would a person do this to their other half? Wtf is wrong with these gross boys? Those poor girlfriends, Jesus Christ "
"Dude, you’re lucky she’s even considering talking to you after your trip is done. You came on too strong way too fast, it would’ve immediately scared off a lot of women. "
"I do think he just misspoke, honestly. keep your ears open for anything else that might be questionable sexism-wise? but I don't think he really thinks you or all women are ""weak"". 

also this is the most hilarious progression of backpedaling in the history of the world:

&gt;Then he backpedaled and said ""I don't mean you're weak. I just mean you wouldn't be able to handle that.""

&gt;Then he said ""Not that you can't handle that, but it's just not appropriate to speak to a woman in that way.""

&gt;Then he said ""Not saying women can't handle tough talking, I just mean, you deserve more respect than that.""

&gt;It kept going. He also said something along the lines of ""you're like a cat, or a kitten."" He also did apologize.

DYING"
"100% this. My boyfriend has the same discomfort with sending nudes and if I pressured him and treated him with half the disrespect and childishness your SO has shown with you, I'd kick *myself* out. "
It sounds to me like you're coming across to Diana as a little *too* involved. I strongly suggest you don't go to the party. It will come across to Diana as disrespectful and probably cause drama in the family. 
Have you talked to her about this?  When did the decline happen?  Was it always this low?  Does she know you are unsatisfied?  Does she care?
"How is it not worth a try?

&gt; That other person is just going to be standing around waiting for the L to happen. 

I told my now wife that I loved her months before she was ready to say it back to me.   We've been happily married 10 years"
"&gt;  I have planned several fun outings. We have gone to Legoland, the mall, state fair, fishing at a park, and went to a fall festival. We all participated in a corn maze, rides, oven-baked pizza, paintballing, pumpkin patch, and a petting zoo. A couple days ago we had a photographer take a bunch of family photos so we could send out Christmas cards in December.

All of this in a week? I'd want to be left the heck alone too tbh. 

However, obviously he acted immaturely and was inconsiderate. He's probably tired from all that ^ plus school. You both had different expectations of what this ~nice dinner would be, neither of you communicated and this happened... that's my guess."
"How do you see this relationship playing out long term, and do you want what he has showed is on offer?   That is really the only question here for you.  Words are easy, but actions are what is really important. "
"Simple: He deletes his okcupid or you walk.

Or, honestly, you walk anyway because he doesn't seem to respect your relationship. "
You are such a moron
"&gt; why was his experience not good enough? 

Is this a class that encourages participation?"
I don't think celebrating the anniversary of your first date indicates he thinks it was exclusive from that point. I mean most people aren't exclusive from the first date on. You may be overthinking this. 
it happens all the time. There are also guys who will actually call to CHECK if the girl gave the right number and will get vocally mad if she gave a fake. There's no way to win in that scenario.
"Stand up for yourself, it doesn't matter why you don't want to do it because you don't owe any of those people an explanation. You don't have to be a dick about it or get anyone in trouble but you can dress however you want, it's not like they can stop you. Making a big deal about wearing a costume won't make you any friends at work though and it sucks if everyone at work hates you. If it becomes too much to handle then I think the culture of that office isn't a good fit for you, and at that point it would be a good idea to try a different company. Take the time now to find a place you can be somewhat happy to work at forever because most companies suck in at least a few ways, and some in a lot of ways."
"&gt; I'm always stressed out and today I plan on telling him to either move out with me in 30 days or I am done with this relationship. 

Which was pretty much advice. And be serious about this. Start collecting housing listings you can afford. At his age he should be more than willing to move the hell out.

That said stop letting her triangulate you two. And the best way to do that is to never be alone with her if you can manage it. She says she wants to talk about something? 

""Oh well SO will be home at X time so we can talk about it then.""

When comes home tell him his mother wants to speak and go find her. She'll get the hint.

""She's avoiding me/Won't talk to me!!!""

You: ""Oh I am trying to avoid another incident like when you said we have to move out."" Smile in that pageant queen way too."
This is excellent advice. Thank you so much!
"OP, for what it’s worth, Reddit gets A LOT of posts from adult children with parents or in laws who are invasive, overbearing, controlling, and/or abusive.

Your post has enough red flags to make people cautious about your motives.

1) You don’t specify whether you have permission to look through their things for old photos, so people assume that you snooped. My dad would never look through my things.

2) You’ve decided that this indicates something about your daughter’s character, and that she’d hide a pregnancy if she could, INSTEAD of revisiting your assumptions about how close you are.

3) You plan to demand an IMMEDIATE explanation, instead of waiting tell you can talk with them face-to-face.

4) You’ve determined that your feelings are more important than any motive they may have had.

IF you decide to confront your daughter, please do it with a genuine sense of curiosity and generosity. Don’t tell her that she SHOULD have told you, but tell her that you want the kind of relationship where she CAN tell you anything. Ask her if there’s anything YOU can do to get closer to that ideal.

Also, know that there might have been some very dark reasons for the marriage. Maybe a serious health scare inspired them to act quickly, to be ready for a medical emergency. Maybe she got pregnant, and they spontaneously decided to get married, but miscarried before sharing the news.

Maybe he applied for a job, and they needed to be married for her to have a chance of staying together. I believe that peace corps folks have to be married to be placed together. There are SO MANY reasons that have nothing to do with you."
"Yeah but it wasn't the brothers fault the parents treated her that way

He might be an ok guy"
"&gt;Logically I know this is something I need to get out of. It's probably unhealthy for her and while I LOVE the sex, and am going to miss it I've started to feel like I've been taking advantage of her this whole time.  
  
BINGO - you're 17 years older and the ONLY good things you can say about her is she's hot and the sex is good. Come on man, don't be that guy.  It's still early, just end it, she will get over you just fine."
"What's with these people in the thread? In my opinion it is understandable that your girlfriend got hurt by your joke. It's not because of you, but because of the situation she was in. Personally if someone gets annoyed with me (specially with my quirks) I would feel very down for days. Your girlfriend might have mentioned the situation passively but you don't know how much it hurt her. Understand her, OP. It's not everyday people can take a joke."
"How the hell is everyone saying you should have known better? I would never have even thought about that. Your cousin should be 100% responsible, IMO. "
"&gt; Finally, having children is no guarantee that you're not going to end up old and alone. I work in long term care...most of our residents have children...and never see them.

"It may not be unreasonable.  Depending on where you live finding vegan only food can be a challenge.  Also depends on what vegan means.  Vegan can mean no animal products whatsoever or it can mean usually eating a plant based diet.  I got hundreds of down votes once for saying people who eat fish occasionally aren't vegetarians. So the definition matters.   If you're really strictly vegan, you don't eat things like honey or apples where the wax is made from bugs or lots of candy because they contain gelatin. "

Contrary to your post I actually don't think this is worth ending a friendship over if they're good friends otherwise. Seems like you could clear it up with a quick conversation."
This happened because of what you did. You are blaming her to avoid accepting this fact.

Hmm, interesting perspective. I am generally a ""glass half empty"" kind of girl so I always assume the worst possible outcome. It is possible that he can accept my boundaries and take a step back which would be perfect.

I'm more focused on the possibility that it blows up in my face and I've created a shit storm of awkward."
"As I was reading this I was thinking, it's like the old saying goes ""you are the company you keep"". Even if he wasn't engaging in sexual acts, he still thinks all of this behaviour is acceptable...why would you want to be with someone who has such low moral standards?  "
"This!!!! 
Disrespect!!!! Talk about helping fuel an insecurity. Honestly there are boys out there for you that wouldn’t talk like this. He sounds like a dh. Girls these days lower their standards cause they think it’s the best they can get/won’t find a guy better/“that’s the way they all are” nah BYE this post has me fired up.

She should play dumb...add in a note later saying it was for a Halloween costume and that she didn't really go bald (or have cancer).  Add lots of XOXOs and shout outs to everyone who asked about her well-being once they saw her bald.
Depends too on the actual ages involved. 40 to 49 is a hell of a lot different than 20 to 29.
"&gt; disrespecting her wishes

Her wishes are about her own contact. She didn't explicitly say that he should never notify them

Except for the fact that she didn't want to risk them trying to make contact. That risk no longer exists"

And her life is over. She will no longer experience any possible pain that comes from simply letting them know the truth"
"&gt;I had a rude awakening to growing older. To stay looking good, you have to put in A LOT of work.

You could have the attention and appearance back if you... say... put in this work.  Like the rest of us.  No, you can't just toss on a t-shirt and look like the mostest beautifulest super model to ever grace this mundane world with her angelic presence, you actually have to do things like:

work out.  
Style your hair.  
Moisturize.  
Wear clothing that's flattering.  
maintain your teeth and nails.  
watch what you eat.

Also, you're not going to look 21 anymore. Ever.  Because you're not.  You have to look your age.

&gt;When I was young, I didn't have to put in any effort into my appearance. I didn't have to go to the gym, spend tons of money on my hair or my skin. I had a natural beauty that took no effort to maintain.

I know you think that you had some kind of specialness that nobody else on the planet ever had ever before, but the truth is is that this is pretty normal for teens and twenty-somethings.  No, it's by no means every girl that has this experience, but it's not something special and unique to only you.

The problem is, for a lot of people, youth and beauty don't just go hand in hand.

For many, Youth *is* Beauty.

You likely haven't lost much of your looks at all... just your youth.  But you can't tell the difference because you fall into that category that conflates one with the other.

As for your relationships with people and your husband... well, when you spend your life focuing on how you look, you attract people who focus on how you look.  Your appearance was the most important part of you and thus you made it an important part of everything you did.  Either you have to change your view and realize that to ... the vast majority of people... being a supermodel isn't actually important, or you have to put in more effort.

Whinge all you want that ""you never paid attention to your looks"" and ""they never meant much to me"" and ""It wasn't the focus of my life"" but... nobody who didn't value their appearance starts off with ""I could have been a model at 12"" or ""I was *prized*, you have no idea*.

&gt;No one prepares you for what it's like when your beauty is gone.

In this modern world?  I doubt it.  Seriously, you're about my age, and my entire life has been lesson after lesson in films, in books, in whatever of ""Be beautiful, but beauty is fleeting"".  What I would believe is that you had a ""It will never happen to ME!"" reaction to most of it.

Therapy is your best bet here.  You have to find validation and self-worth in things that aren't your appearance, and you're about 30 years behind the curve so... you've got a lot of catching up to do.  You also have to change, internally, what you *value* - you're holding on to I'M PRETTY TELL ME I'M PRETTY! as a major value of yours, and so long as you hold that value highly, it's going to be a problem.

You've also got to be really careful not to infect your children with this attitude.  They're going to pick up on the fact that Mommy Only Wants To Be Beautiful and internalize that lesson pretty thoroughly if you don't get this handled soon."
"This is really perfect, actually. Yeah, a little less sarcastic. I was thinking of doing something like that, too, but man everything is just...I'm stunned because I'm still in 'what the hell' mode. "

Sarah deliberately sabotaged your party.
"I got married 3 weeks ago and my hubby is a postman (mailman for you guys in the US) he said he would only wear it when we go out together as his hands would get caught in letterboxes.  

I'm cool with that and I feel OP's wife should read this post to see the responses so she can educate herself a lot more to the dangers at work in a variety of industries. "
"&gt;I'm trying to figure out a way to talk to him again because I know another conversation needs to happen.

No no no no no.  Another conversation does not need to happen.  You need to completely avoid any kind of contact with this guy.

There is nothing to gain from talking to him."
"This so much. The first time it happened it was random, then she started telling you about it. Now it's in your mind and you're worried about it so it happens over and over. Just let it go. Laugh it off.

She should really stop asking you questions when you're asleep! That's super weird, she's looking for a reason to be jealous."
I remember when I was 16 and hanging out with a 28 year old. I thought I was so hot and mature. Now I think back on it and it makes my skin crawl. 
"If a coroner is ever working on my body, I hope that they are like your boss. "
"And, in fact, the mother is actively encouraging her to spend time with and forgive her father.

OP, I say write one letter addressed to mother, stepfather and father and either email it to all three so they can see that they got identical letters, or give each identical copies. Express your version of events calmly and clearly, explain how you are old enough to start making decisions on which parent you stay with. Explain how it has nothing to do with one house being more ""fun"" than another, because the mistress is clearly trying to have a relationship with you (shes just doing it in a selfish, narcissistic way), but that your personality as you are developing into a full human just gets along with your mother's family activities better. You will have to make some sacrifices to go to your dad's occasionally, so start by agreeing to go there for holidays you care less about. Once you turn 18, you can ignore him completely. 2 years seems like forever while living it, but count the months and it goes much faster than you think. Don't put that in the letter, let him think that you'll keep switching around holidays after you're 18. Maybe offer Christmas this year in exchange for your birthday? It really is horrible of your dad to want to ruin your and your stepbrothers plans, but don't attack him in the letter. Instead, phrase it as ""Dad, Josh took off his normal day of work to spend my birthday with me. I have been looking forward to this for a long time, and many people's schedules have been planned around this event for months."" Then ask if he would like to see you the next weekend, and suggest his favorite restaurant to eat at then. It's perfectly reasonable to explain that you are already beginning to have resentment over how the divorce is being handled, that you are feeling like a pawn for them to use against each other, and that you feel like stepfather is the only one who actually listens to you as a person instead of an object. (That's why I said to include him, he will both enjoy the compliment, and it seems like he will be on your side to help convince your mother, even if you don't know that that conversation ever happens.) You might want to say something like ""I don't want to permanently harm our relationship, so Iwant to address this resentment now."" They might see it for the veiledthreat it is, but it might work anyway.

The most important thing in this letter is to feign humbleness and don't include anything that might put them on the defensive. Try to reread it from each of their perspectives and find things that might hurt their feelings. I know you probably want to hurt them right now, because they've hurt you, but that won't get you your treetop adventure. Get what you want now by acting your butt off that you want to work with them to make everyone happy, and get mad again later.. Good luck."
"Wow, how dare she have a close male friend! Nothing in the post makes it seem like this was a one sided friendship so I'm curious as to where you got that info. "
"Here's the other perspective: when your friend has kids, you suddenly become the least important person in their life. You are the one who gets rescheduled in favor of play dates, hung up on because the baby is crying, the one who has to drive farther, make 100% of the effort, compromise, wait alone in a restaurant because your parent friend is late, try to hear the football game or your dungeon master over the crying, etc etc etc. Me personally, I tried so hard to make it work with a couple of people because I understood that their situation was harder than mine, but after a while it actually started to chip away at my self-esteem. I started to feel like nothing about me or my needs or my time mattered when there were other people's kids involved. Call me selfish, ok, but it really hurt, and eventually it hurt less (and was a lot less complicated) to just do things on my own. Every human being needs to feel like they matter and have their needs, time, energy, and feelings taken into account, even if they happen to be over the age of 18."
"80% of the men complimenting teenage-you were not actually validating your looks; they were targeting you because you were visibly young and thus naive. The reason those compliments dropped off around age 25 is because you started to look like a Real Live Adult, not because you spontaneously turned into an old crone. Seriously, OP, I have yet to meet a woman who won't attest to the fact that catcalls, compliments from random strangers, and the like weren't way more common when they were younger. You seem to be taking all this as some value neutral comment on your looks and personality, but it's not. At all.

You seriously do need therapy, because you have some really entrenched and damaging ideas about yourself and what a good life looks like. You have a husband, kids you say you love, the time and money to travel internationally, a college degree, and a million other things, but you're on an anonymous website insisting it's all meaningless because you hit 30. That's objectively pretty crazy, you know?"
"I'm only 35, but I wholeheartedly agree. Even if it's just an emotional affair. Even if it's ""just flirting we haven't even met yet"". If your relationship is monogamous, this shit is not acceptable."
"Thank you. OP and his wife both work long hours away from their kids. They are equally ""outsourcing"" parenting or ""abdicating"" from their role.

If the nanny happened to be a man, then the kids might call him ""Daddy."" They would see him more than their Dad, but they would still understand that their mom is Mommy because she's the only female caregiver they see.

It's a problem that needs to be solved, but a lot of the responses are judgmental without questioning the gender dynamics at play in the world."
"So you snooped through someone's underwear, tried them *on* (fucking EW jesus christ lady), and you ""accidentally"" took them....

What are the kids doing while she's sleeping in until 10?
Pretty sure if she did you’d be the one getting phone calls.  Box up her stuff for when she comes back.  I don’t recommend trying to reconcile.  You deserve better than someone who treats you the way she has.
"Well, she has learned to cope, because she has experienced this all her life. Hell yeah, it still sucks, but there is literally nothing she can do, except hiding herself and that feels like shit either.

Sorry, I do not have any advice, there is literally nothing you can do about it and she can't either and it still sucks."
"Same. It's so goddamn creepy. I'm like ok, not only was I never interested, now I'm freaked out by you because you've given yourself away as a controlling asshole."
"Usually it takes longer than a few months to lose the ""spark"" of a new relationship, especially for people so young. Sometimes things just run their course and sexual chemistry sometimes just dies with it, especially when you go off to college and start meeting new people. Not every relationship is forever. Some last a few months some last for years. 

What is it that she wants now that she's told you this? Does she want to see other people? Break up? Or is she just telling you this? "
"Totally get why she flipped her shit and is PISSED. She has every right to be. Not that you should have had a child with her at that time, but because you guys weren't on the same page.

She feels like you totally wasted her time, and in a way, you did. Then you and your new, 10 years younger, wife get pregnant within a year of marriage. New wife got everything 1st wife wanted and didn't get. I'd be pretty angry too. That's an appropriate reaction.

Appropriate is not trashing your car. I'd install motion activated cameras, and take the trash talking. People you care about know the difference, and people you don't care about's opinions don't matter. 

However, if your current wife is 'terrified of my ex', and you had a 'long and drawn out divorce', I suspect there have been ongoing problems, not just one phone call, some trash talking and car vandalism. I'd be concerned and wary, but not terrified.

I don't think trying to talk to her is going to help. Current wife got the husband and baby, and she didn't. Nothing is going to make that any better. Sorry."
"Its actually rude to ask people out when they are working out. You can strike up conversations before, or after, but not during.  You might have more luck finding sporty hobbies that are more social, like a trail running, bicycle, or hiking club. Or adopt a rescue doggy and take them on walks and to dog parks.  Dog people are mandated by law to swap all of their dogs life history,  habits, and personality everytime they meet another dog owner, so you will always have people to talk to."
"Sexual compatibility (whether it's a lot or a little) is SO important in a relationship.

"&gt;Truth is I'm exhausted because I have barely slept while he's been away. **Ive just been a little scared**. I've also totalled about 12hours since he's been away.

"What does your child's doctor say about the breastfeeding? Did she consult with them before doing it? I'm not a dietitian but I can't really see the nutritional benefit from it, or from antibodies point of view, if your son has all vaccinations. If this is pure attachment from your wife's point of view she needs professional help, the psychology/psychiatry kind. "
I would go around your SIL and talk directly to your niece maybe by text or in person.  Let her know you guys love her very much but this is an adults only trip and that it wasn't fair of her mom to tell her she could go because this trip is only for adults.  Explain that you understand if she is disappointed but kiddos were never going to on this trip and perhaps offer to take her to a movie or kids museum when you come back.  It lets her know she is lived and wanted by you guys but sets a firm boundary that kids won't be allowed at this event.  If you let your SIL do the talking she will likely spew hatred about you guys to her daughter and by know her daughter obviously knows she is a terrible mom and would likely understand that her mom put her in this spot not you guys.

"A few things: 

1. My 7 year old knows not to buy things on phone/tablet games. She can also read. She knows to cancel out if something prompts her to pay for something with the itunes account, etc. An 8 year old who is often allowed to play phone games should have been taught this. ESPECIALLY on someone else’s phone. If she was 4, I would maybe say you’re the idiot who should’ve locked down your phone. But this kid is in second grade, not potty training. 

2. Even if it is an honest mistake on the kid’s part (which would be due to her parents never teaching her rule #1 of phone games), if it were my kid I would have apologized profusely and paid you back for the purchases. Because I’m responsible for my own kid. If I didn’t really have the money, I would still try to cover half of it or try to help figure out ways to try to get the charges reversed, etc. It doesn’t matter that she wasn’t there when her kid did it. If your kid walks into a store while with your sister in law and breaks something expensive, you as the parent are the dummy who didn’t teach your kid not to mess with things in stores and you need to pay for it. It’s a tough lesson for everyone, but hey at least now it’s been learned, right? That’s how parenting goes. 

3. Keep in mind that your cousin is going through something difficult and stressful. She is losing her dad, and can’t bring her daughter to the hospital to see him. Your bills being late may be a huge deal to you, but right now that seems completely petty and irrelevant to her - UNDERSTANDABLY. You need to apologize for being pushy and harsh. She needs to apologize for trying to stick you with the bill for this when you were just trying to help her out. Apologize first, tell her you are just really stressed and don’t know what you’re going to do, have a heart to heart. Then the both of you need to figure out a solution you can both afford or work on. Call google pay. Call the game company. Do whatever you can to get the charges reversed or reduced, and you might be in more luck than you think. "
"Hey say this to him when he acts up. It might work.

""hey why don't you shut the fuck up about this already? I genuinely have no interest in your opinion on this matter. You like something. I like something different. Cool. We got that cleared up. Now shut the fuck up.""

OP, honestly, this is difficult to take seriously. Your roommate is being a pretentious shit head and you're entertaining it. It doesn't matter what the subject matter is. He doesn't have to like what you like and vice versa. Tell him off as such. End of story. "
"My ex-boyfriend was a red-piller and he actually got a lot more extreme in his views while we were dating.  He had some serious internalized misogyny -- the forums were just an outlet that made his core beliefs on women acceptable.  He used them to bolster his own confidence, and started treating me worse.  Their pick-up tactics can be repurposed to in-relationship manipulative techniques; my self-esteem plummeted.  I started doubting my memory of conversations we'd had and my ability to tell right actions from wrong ones.  In reflection, it really felt like he hated me some days.  But he still cried the day I broke up with him, because having a girlfriend meant he was also a man.  The red-pill stuff just gave him the power to think he deserved control of me."
"This would be the biggest turn off to me. I had to wake up every two hours to breastfeed (I have a 6 month old now) and you better believe husband got up with me to change diaper while I got ready to feed. He's always said we're in this together and thank god.. 

the fact that he doesn't really help you at all or has an interest to help is a huge red flag. It seems like he does everything possible to avoid his own child. And you. Couples counseling is needed. What a jerk. "
Especially when it's so obviously transactional.
"Tell him he can stay with you if he gets a job.  I'm not sure if or how long he's been actively looking for a job, but give him a month (or some other definitive deadline that feels appropriate) to start contributing.

If not, he needs to get out of your place and find a way of supporting himself.  He doesn't have to go to his family, but you won't continue to bankroll him. "
"One option you could consider is for Mom to take away your sister's phone. Say something like: ""I spoke with [Sister's friends]'s parents, who said that you have been degrading them over WhatsApp. They showed me the messages, and even when they asked you to stop you kept on harassing them. For now, you've lost the privilege of having a cell phone until you can demonstrate that you will use one responsibly, and maybe this will give you some time to think about you treat your supposed friends."" That sorta thing. 
"
"&gt; she just did not see it coming for some reason. But, she should have considering that most of our conversations where fights, and I never lied to her. She knew how unhappy I was with her. 

Her inability to add 2+2 and get 4 is *not* your responsibility, or your problem. It sucks for her that her parents didn't raise her properly, but she's 28 years old and has had plenty of time to correct her own failings. She's acting like a toddler throwing a tantrum, and her parents just want to buy her the toy to make her stop crying. But you're a person, not a toy, and getting back with her won't actually fix her problems. It will just make you miserable. "
"Your doctor is absolutely WRONG and irresponsibly so. You need to get in contact with a therapist immediately.

If you are concerned you might hurt your child, I would call your local CPS (child protective services). They can evaluate whether you are a danger to your baby and if so, make other arrangements for the baby's care."
"Yup, I get that. Or he's mad because he had this perfect thing planned out for his daughter's birthday and it's ruined, but that doesn't mean he's going to continue to be mad. We can be mad at people irrationally and recognize that and choose to not humor it."
"Yes, Luke didn't do anything but he started laughing. He thinks it's hilarious. It's not. "
You need to end this. There is no other option.
"I hope this guy learns to be upfront about having a child from now on. I kind of get it, I was a single parent and it's scary telling someone you like that you have a kid because you don't know if they'll lose interest or not. But that's not an excuse. It's manipulative and sucks for both the person being lied to and for the kid who might eventually have to live with a situation like this one. And surprisingly, at least in the circles I ran in, nobody who showed interest in me ever lost interest after finding out I have a kid. A few, like my current gf, actually thought of it as a plus because they've always wanted kids. I wish OPs boyfriend was the one making this post so I could talk to him about it. "
This is physical abuse. You need to leave the relationship before it escalates even further.

"&gt; I'd like to file a complaint about his conduct, and let the medical board decide if this was ok or not. She's afraid of ""making a fuss"" because ""it wasn't that bad"", but she's clearly bothered by what happened. We both agreed to see a different endocrinologist. 

You should absolutely file a complaint. If this doctor handles patients regularly like that, he really shouldn't be a doctor. This isn't making a ""fuss"", this is making the board aware of how this patients treat his patients. "

"He doesn't sound like somebody you can expect to have a happy long term relationship with. He keeps putting himself into bad situations where he has little or no control, and is eventually going to overdose, get an STD, or get arrested for any number of crimes.

"Hi there OP. I wanted to write to you from a woman that has been in this situation. As others have pointed out, your wife waited patiently 5 years, then agreed to another 2. And now she is just done waiting.

I was in this position. Met my guy at 26. Started wanting a baby at 30ish. He kept saying he wanted kids, but also kept moving the goalposts. We need: ""Better jobs"" -get better job- ""More money saved up"" -save save save- Baby time? Nope, ""Need better health insurance"" -purchase insurance- Baby time?! ""nope, need to fix the house up for a baby"" ...oh, well then we spent all our savings on fixing the house, need to save again.....

You get where this was going. He wanted to run my clock out. I know that is not what you are doing here. But it may have the same net result. The way you two are going, you may very well never be able to afford children.

How it played out for us? I went off birth control (told him 3 months before I did) and started to refuse to have sex unless it was of the sort that could create a baby. I figured either we'd have a baby or he'd leave me. And I was ANGRY at him, and resentful, of him denying me a child. Our relationship really suffered for it. (Of note, I'm the breadwinner in the relationship. We had enough to have a child, even if we weren't wealthy)

Where we are now? I'm 46. We've been together 20 years. I never got to have children, and we haven't had sex in 16 years over this standoff. Once you go down that road, I'm not sure how you ever go back to a sexual relationship, tbh.

If I had it to do over? I'd go back to when he moved the second set of goalposts and leave. Give myself x months/years to find a partner, and if I didn't, go to a sperm bank. I would 1000% choose having a baby over my partner.

Also, we are in the process of splitting over this issue. I can do fertility treatment and give birth myself or privately adopt an infant until age 51. I have 5 years to make this happen. Or, luckily for me, I'm good with adoption or fostering through foster care, which has no age limit.

This is one of those arguments where no one wins. But at this point, your wife is obsessing, living, breathing, marking the minutes until baby time. I'm not telling you to have a baby you're not ready for. But the choice will have an affect on your marriage. You may well end up divorced regardless. 

Each friend and family member that announces a pregnancy/baby shower/birth/christening/kiddie birthday party is going to be like a knife to the gut for her. I got to the point I couldn't go to them any more. I ended up leaving, sobbing, every single time.

Just wanted you to know how it feels, from the other side. I'm sorry you're going through this. Best wishes."

Reading OPs post I was honestly a bit chocked to see that this behaviour was being excused as ""not proper"". Sweden is really secular, most people are atheist and marriage isn't really something deemed necessary to a relationship. What OPs SIL is doing would be considered hella rude by Swedish standards tho."
"I adored my grandmother with every fiber of my being. No name could ever be so important if it was the name of a man who hurt her. I'd have to know, though. Is there a way to delicately tell her? Perhaps through your child?"
"Time. You get used to it with time. People generally fight change. The shit you said about old vs new money, however, makes you sound like a snob. You might want to check that. "
"Personally, no matter what the lie was about, I don't think I could ever get over being lied to that blatantly for such a long period of time.


I would never be able to regain that trust. If he would lie about something stupid like that, I would always wonder if he was lying about something else. I could understand a single lie, or I could understand maybe a lie sustained for a few months out of embarrassment or something, but not what you've described. "
"Her comment about ""learning how to eat pussy and be a better husband"" tells you a lot. Relationships need a lot more work than a few dates. She seems to feel unappreciated in a domestic as well as sexual way.


Couples counseling would probably be really helpful for you guys to hash out what the real problem is. If you do some research and come to her with a few counselors picked out and a potential schedule for you guys to go, I bet she go with you with open arms."
OP clarified in comments that he apologized extensively when he realized she was bothered. 
"Honestly, there's not really any blame to place here. Some people freak out hearing about any sexual past of their partners, at least early on (or hearing about it ever). It's not crazy that he didn't volunteer that information. It helps in relationships (although this tends to be for more established ones) to hash out what each one would want to know or never know about certain situations/occurrences, etc.

Anyhow, it's perfectly understandable that you feel the way you. If you can't move past it, that's okay. But you need to break it off with him in that case (permanently, most likely). Otherwise, this is about you processing it and moving forward with the relationship."
"Huh. Weirdly enough, something similar happened to me. Welcome to the shitty wedding situation club! I didn't think I'd find another person in this sort of situation! And for what it's worth, the ex and I had been together 9 years.

Well, first up, just know that everyone thinks he's a Grade A asshole, and they want what's best for you. I know when it happened to me, the bride and the other female guests coordinated to make sure that I caught the bouquet. It was embarrassing. (But sidenote: Believe it or not, I actually was the next one to get married (to someone different.))

Look, no one here knows what's going through his head. I could speculate all day long, but I can't give you a definitive answer, sadly. Everyone else here could speculate too, but no one knows what's happening in your boyfriend's mind. 

What I can tell you is that this is 100% NOT OKAY AT ALL. Is he hoping you'll take the initiative and break up with him? Maybe. Is he cheating? Maybe. Is he depressed? Maybe. But neither scenario is okay! You deserve better. If (and this is a big if), if it's ONLY depression driving him, then he needs to work on himself today by booking in an appointment with a psych. And then he owes you a gigantic apology.
"
"Yes, black hole of integrity is a great way to put it."
"I did the same thing, and so did my twin. We honestly would not have been able to see the timer without them. However, I always had my goggles on until the end of the practice. And I definitely didn't do any splashing. At the end of the day, this definitely was not the OP's responsibility."
"&gt;  or paying ~~you~~ a cleaner to do them

I'd add an invoice to have your couch cleaned to this too."
"You poor thing. I don't know what to say. But at least you know what you're up against. Unfortunately I don't think he's going to change until he loses his wife and child. That might bring a reality check and get him to agree to counseling but he'll likely have to hit rock bottom first, which might not happen if he has his mother in his ear telling him how great he is. "
"Do you have a friend you can confide in that you trust? 



Do you feel comfortable going to the authorities? He literally heals your captive. He can go to prison for a long time. He can do this to someone else. 

Just think of all your options. I'm so sorry about this. Don't let it define you. It can destroy you if you allow it. Stay strong and if you ever need someone to talk to I'm here if you wanna PM me "
"I agree with this. I would pack all stuff, bring it to mom or a friend and move on. This is ridiculously cruel to do."
"Lol ""Western women besides your mom"" wow, what a precious gem in the midst of billions of western sluts hahaha. 

OP this degree of racism is so ridiculous it's almost funny. I would start to act as such. The lack of logic is extraordinary. 

Once you're 18 you don't have to do what they say as long as you're willing to pay your own way. Look towards that. In the meantime, either leave when they start up with their racist garbage, or grey-rock. Just shut it out. Go about your day. Tidy up the livingroom like they're not there, la la so busy! 

I'm sorry that your relationship with your girlfriend will be so limited by your parents. It's difficult because you're minors and they can exert control here. It's likely best for you both to decide if you think a relationship where you sneak around if worth the stress and risk here. 

This will pass OP; I know it seems like they're shipping you off (kinda are) but use it to your advantage. Educate yourself on every culture and experience you can and use it to throw their racist BS in their faces. People are equal. Learn your roots...and anything else. Hell I'd start bringing home library books about India...and any other country you can find!! They want you to learn your roots? Learn everyone's and cheerfully point out similarities lol. That's my petty revenge. And it will end up serving you very well in life! 

Turn what you can into a positive even though I know it can seem like you're drowning in their cruel words and ridiculous opinions. You're your own person, and you're 3 years away from independence. "
"She was your family and your best friend and your partner since you were a freshman in high school - 7 years. Dude, that's a long time. You said it hasn't been long, but you want to be your own person again. You have probably never been your own person - you started with her in 9th grade. Take a deep breath and give yourself lots of time. You can't fix this fast - only time will help. And it will help.
"
OP has absolutely no relationship with her half sister.  She hasn’t even met her before.  And this stinks of manipulation from the father as well.  Why couldn’t the girl stay with one of OPs brothers?
"What a nasty, vicious, selfish person. 

OP, you say this is the first time he ever treated you like this and I'm telling you to make sure it's the last. I wish I'd dumped my ex after the first fight where he got this nasty, I would have saved myself *so* much time and pain. Run before you waste another two and a half years like I did. "
"I definitely understand your frustrations. My dad also isn't a faithful character, so I understand the betrayal.

My guess is that your mom is in a bit of a pickle. You know how your dad keeps saying she's ""poisoning [you] against him?"" Those aren't random words. In a divorce with split custody, one parent talking down about the other parent to the child can result in some sort of penalty... Though I'm not sure of the particulars, depending on the state. I doubt your mom is super enthusiastic about you spending time with your dad and his mistress... She's probably just trying to keep the peace so your dad can't claim she's poisoning you against him and get more custody or something. Of course, it's easier for your dad to blame your mom rather than accept the fact that he's a jerk and you genuinely want nothing to do with him.

You should be old enough to decide where you want to spend your time. Talk to your mom about revising the custody agreement with your input. She might still insist you spend time with him. Many mothers feel guilty when their ex husbands are shitty fathers, and still try to keep that father/daughter relationship intact. Father/daughter relationships are very important... They give young girls the standard by which they measure relationships with any other men in their lives. But a shitty one is not better than none. Here's some dialogue you could possibly find useful:

""Mom, I know you want me to have a good relationship with my dad, but you can't make him be a good father. Dad made his choices, and he didn't choose me any more than he chose you. He chose her. Please do not force me to allow someone to mistreat me. You are teaching me that I have absolutely no say in how I allow men to treat me."" 

As far as your dad and the mistress... Absolute grey rock. Google the term. Do not say anything negative to them. (That is giving your dad ammunition against your mom). Do not give your dad any  details about your plans with your step dad. Your father sees you as his property to which your step dad is a challenge. It might be satisfying to see your dad pissed about you spending time with your step dad... But it will only make life harder. He is more likely to leave you alone if  he doesn't see your SD as a threat. When your dad asks about plans with SD, give short, non-committal responses. You aren't sure if you have anything planned... Nothing written in stone yet. Practice being distantly cordial. Keep to yourself... But if they insist you go somewhere, just go along politely and keep to yourself. Be boring. They will lose interest in forcing you to bend to their will. Trust me... Cold civility is usually more irritating that teenage aggression. Letting someone know they are not worth getting upset about is one of the biggest slights you can give. Try your best to see your dad's blustering for what it is: a petty attempt to control you because you are all he legally can control. It's really sad, honestly. Foster your relationship with your step dad, and try not to make it harder for him to be the good father figure he wants to be. When you turn 18, you get to decide who you keep in your life. "
"I totally agree with this. OP really should come clean about her past with Ryan regardless of Adam because if it's not Adam that spills it, it's very possible Ryan could very well find out through other means given his job and I'm sure that he wouldn't appreciate being blindsided by that information. Once she has cleared the air with Ryan over her past then she is in a position to tell Adam to stfu or she'll tell Ryan about him and all of his stoner buddies (not that Ryan would really care anyway as long as they aren't selling). I realize that this may be petty, but it's not like Adam doesn't deserve it after the shit that he's trying to pull."
"After one year with my company (which will be in February) I get a pretty significant pay increase. If we keep spending the way we are now, it should allow us to save a few hundred each month. Which isn't great, but a whole lot better than where we are now. Between that and my wife continuing to work, I really do think we'll be in a much better financial position by the time she's 30. I truly am confident that I'd be comfortable in starting to try then, as long as nothing to set us back happens between then and now.

And we've discussed all of this, we've laid it out, I've showed her the numbers I'm thinking of and how we're going to get there. But apparently she is no longer willing to wait."
"Exactly. I told her at this point, scholarships are what's going to get her there. Not him."
"Communicate better. 

Wow is not a constructive thing to say by any measure. You wanted to communicate your disappointment, so use words like an adult and communicate without shitting on hers.

""Hey there's still time for you to take public transit. Why can't you go?"" 

Having said that your gf needs to do the same by talking through why she's upset when you guys have the chance.

You guys are basically doo doo at communicating and respecting each other in that regard. You're both wrapped up in your own point of view. 

Couples disagree all the time. What makes things work is communicating in order to understand where each of you are coming from. Without understanding each other you can't fully respect each other. You're just focused on your internal sentiment and judging the other person like ""why is this person not agreeing with me"" "
"Do you have a sense of when you could move out? If not, start making logistical plans. Figure out what you can afford, what it would look like to break your lease, and what moving might look like. I want to tell you to break up immediately, for both of your sakes, but this dude sounds like the kind of guy who's going to give you a lot of pushback about wanting to leave, and I don't want you to strand yourself in a post-breakup cohabitation situation with him indefinitely.

Once you have your ducks in a row, tell him that you're not happy and you want to break up. There's no way to do this that won't hurt him, and it's going to hurt to see him hurt, but directness is best. 

In the meantime, start doing things that aren't about him. Join a club or a committee at school. Start attending a meet-up group or a book club. Go places where friendly people are. Notice who you like spending time with and who possible friends might be. You may not get to a point with them soon where you can crash on their couch, but you'll have friendly faces waiting for you on the other side of this breakup. "
"My husband works a full time job and he had a 40min commute when we had our first, he'd always helped me when I needed it. This guy is a lazy asshole. :/ I feel sorry for OP. "
"No cake, I'm hitting the lawyer, deleting the gym and getting Facebook. "
"As many others in the comments have pointed out, silicone bands can still lead to de-gloving. Necklaces and other dangling jewelry are also likely a no-go. Tattoo? That's up to him. I personally have no tattoos and don't plan on getting any, so there's really no way I could be talked into getting one.

Honestly, I just don't think you properly appreciate how dangerous OP's job can be. Which is fine, just maybe don't post in a thread trying to advise him."
"Your boyfriend should shut it down comprehensively and institute some boundaries. If she doesn't like that, too bad.

If he's unwilling to do so, I'd be sceptical of his claims to be over her."
truth is always stranger than fiction
"Agreed. I used to be a flight attendant. On one memorable flight, we had a girl who was extremely hungover. She ended up throwing up all over herself. We had to put her clothes in a trash bag and wrap her in blankets. Then a few minutes later she locked herself in the lav and promptly passed out with her head in the toilet. Nobody got beverage service on that flight, and everyone had to wait to deplane so the EMT’s could board first upon landing.

Nobody was happy, especially the girl with the hangover."
"Wild guess:

Does he have an ex-gf who is from that same hometown who will also be in town during that time?

Because it's obvious he's uninviting you and is AWARE; what's not obvious is WHY.

My bet is that an ex-flame or someone he once pursued is in town and he wants a chance to hang out with her (maybe with a group of people) and not have to worry about protecting OP's feelings.

Just a thought. I hope it's not that...."
"I have asked. He thinks my “bright mind” should be used to help people and not feed into social and financial misogyny and some other bullshit that’s not going to put food on the table. I try to remind him that he’s a damn barista and he got his first job less than a year ago and I’ve been working since I was 16, so our mindsets are different. "
"&gt;then she starts pulling the ""I thought you loved me"" card. We've only been dating for three months, so that wasn't going to work on me.

well thank god for that. yeah, I don't really see this working out - honestly more because she pulled that bullshit manipulation rather than her belief in cryptids. 

all that said, that camping story is the funniest thing I have heard in *days*. "
"Wife here. Only found this because he woke me at 3am to show me it and I'm now insanely angry.

I like the fact that you didn't mention that I told you I was wrong to react negatively to counselling and told you I thought it would be great. You didn't mention that getting married so fast was a mutual decision. You didn't mention that I moved here for your job and gave up mine, which I was in for 2 years and loved more than anything, because you convinced me that it would be more comfortable for both of us. You don't mention that before I moved over here I worked 150 hour weeks to save up money and pay for all of the groceries until I am legally able to work. That's the point where, even though I have heard (from you) that I'll make far less money than you, I have INSISTED that I pay exactly HALF of every bill.

My friend who stayed for 2 weeks did so because he originally was supposed to meet and stay with his boyfriend, had brought barely any money with him, and had nowhere else to go when he found out his boyfriend was cheating on him the whole time. I didn't want to leave him stranded.

You haven't mentioned the reason you are sleeping on the floor. It's because we were watching a movie with MIL and she did not like it and I offered to change it. The second movie we put on was sci-fi and you and my mother both know that I dislike that genre, but I said I would give it a shot. When I was ASKED MY OPINION I explained that I wasn't enjoying the film. I stopped watching it, went for a cigarette and a long shower, and then waited until your movie finished. You walked into the bedroom and i asked you if the movie was any good, and you accused me of being passive aggressive by not finishing it. You called me a 'fucking asshole', told me you couldn t even be in a bed next to me, and made a bed on the floor. You told me that you didn't 'want to be reminded that [I] exist', that I'm the most miserable person in the world, and that you can't believe that someone like you is stuck with a person like me.

You haven't mentioned the fact that we started to argue to begin with after it turned out that you had been sleeping with someone else and hadn't mentioned it, just a few weeks before we became a couple. While you were telling me you were in love with my personality and my soul, you were sleeping with someone else.  The same person who you did not cut out of your life at all, and months later told personal information about my sex life 1 month before we got married. The girl then spoke about her future with you and how it was disgraceful that I didn't send you nudes and that I was only with you for a green card and you didn't have anything to say in my defence.

You haven't mentioned that just a few weeks after I moved here, giving up my family, friends, job and country, you told me that your life has been going downhill since the moment you met me.

You didn't mention anything about how  you call me names, like idiot or retard, you tell me how my job meant nothing (working with abused children means nothing?), you've told me you only have sex with me to pass the time and kill boredom, told me I'm a miserable selfish disrespectful nasty passive aggressive rude childish person, had me crying crazy amounts.  And I have been PUSHING to get you to see how the way you treat me isn't right and that we BOTH need to change. 

And now you've finally come back to the bed, after I yelled at you because I'm so fucking ANGRY about how you always make me out to be a monster, to the point where I almost believe it. You want me to apologise to you for my actions this evening but have no apology for telling me you wish I didn't exist? "
"Well, I didn't actually use the word ""please"", but I find that these sort of awkward conversations go better if the person doesn't feel like they're being attacked. Sure, he is in the wrong, but most people end up being in the wrong at one point or another. If he doesn't shape up, well then OP should reevaluate, like I said."
"It’s relevant because it changes how people would recommend talking to her. 

Clearly this ain’t a woman that your husband had some son-in-law relationship with prior to your son being born. And given the lack of a relationship, grandma could be having issus within herself regarding how to keep her daughter around her grandson after she, the only person in this situation who seems to have any real relationship with the mom, dies. 

I think there’s some great advice regarding how grandma can record her memories of her daughter for the son to have later on."
"My brother and I have a similar age gap to your children. He's seven years older than me, and I'm also a girl (I'm now 23). He was also extremely responsible -- and I'd like to think I was fairly well-behaved -- and he started babysitting me for several hours at a time when he was around 13 or so. I'd actually really suggest this: it was a great opportunity for my brother and me to bond and feel like we were becoming independent. Nothing catastrophic ever happened, unless you count us adding so many add-ins to a box of brownie mix that it didn't all fit in the pan."
"This is illegal and it is also dangerous to cold turkey quit a lot of anti-depressants. 

Tell your mom."
"Did she figure in the cost of actually having the child, meaning OB appointments, OB birth costs, and hospital/birthing center costs? Insurance doesn't cover a whole lot these days and the actual costs are upwards of $15,000-20,000 for a complication-free vaginal birth.

Then you have all the one-time stuff that's is needed....bed, car seat, stroller at the very least. Then there's all the ongoing costs....insurance increases, diapers, possibly formula and bottles, clothes, laundry, electricity, baby-doctor visits, toys.

Did she factor any of that when she figured she could only work part-time AND hire a nanny to fit into your one-bedroom apartment?

Have her do a true cost-analysis...ask over at r/parents for a list of the least amount of stuff you have to have (one-time &amp; ongoing) and have her find average costs for everything involved. Them ask her how to budget it on your current salaries. If that doesn't work, she may be wanting a baby more than actually wanting to parent."
"As an experienced swinger myself, I badly want to say this is a troll, but weve encountered many situations just like this IRL. Ive seen guys force their wives to start doing this so they could chase a girl they like, completely forgetting how easy it is for women to get laid (compared to men). It happens a lot, and it is sad. 

Several others have said it: be careful what you wish for."
"I know, right? It's so hard when they seem like really nice people in every other respect. I had the same thought when I was in your position, because I was 19 and the lecturer was 33 and just seemed a bit clueless but a nice guy overall with good intentions.

There are two ways that I figured out this wasn't the best reading on my situation - maybe it will help you? Feel free to disregard this if it doesn't mesh with your experience, but it might help in some way. I realised that my lecturer behaved in a way that indicated he actually did understand the consequences to some degree, but decided to act on his feelings anyway. I also realised that even if he had good intentions, this was a situation where intentions didn't matter as much as outcome of the actions. 

Applying this to your situation...

The first issue I have with this guy is that if he really were clueless about everything, then he wouldn't have been able to anticipate the consequences of approaching you like that and wouldn't have given it much thought. However, he  said a few things in his email that suggest he actually did give this a lot of thought but decided that any possible consequences were worth it. First, he was careful to frame it as an impulsive act, that he felt safe ""to blurt something out."" This is troubling, because it means he knows for sure that a deliberately planned decision to approach you would be wrong. So he is aware to some degree that what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldn't have mentioned this. He also contradicts this impulsiveness when he says that he had ""spent hours poring over"" your personality. This worries me because it means he gave the situation quite a lot of thought and decided to go ahead with it anyway. He weighed up the consequences on you, and decided that the benefit he would experience from telling you (emotional release? a bit of a thrill? something to reminisce over later?), outweighed the importance he placed on the negative consequences for you. He's right about one thing in the email - it was definitely a ""selfish"" thing for him to do.

I think that the other commenters in this thread are right when they say that someone with his level of experience as a professor means that he knew what he was doing. :(

The second issue I have is with the intentions. There's a legal concept that I came across recently that has helped me understand stuff like this called ""strict liability"". This is a situation in criminal law where it doesn't matter what your intentions are, it only matters whether you did the thing or not. It's usually applied to small time infringements like parking tickets. The ticketing officer isn't interested in your feelings about whether you meant to overstay by two hours - you still have to pay the fine! I feel like in relationships, there are times when it is appropriate to consider another person's feelings and intentions, and there are times when it isn't. For relationships that start on equal footing between two people who care about each other, sure, it's good to put yourself in their shoes and allow a bit of room for intentions. But in professional relationships, especially where there is a power imbalance, it's actually totally okay to ignore someone's explanation of ""intentions"" when their behaviour actually qualifies as sexual harassment and abuse of power. It doesn't matter what his intentions are when he has a responsibility to you as his student to make you feel respected and comfortable. So even if he acts like he didn't mean it, that doesn't have to carry any weight here, if you know what I mean?

So sorry to hear about the death in your family. :(

Maybe for your sanity, you might be better off putting this aside for now? Maybe talk to a counselor if that has helped you in the past? And then revisit what you want to do about it once everything has calmed down a bit? There's no penalty for not responding to a situation like this straight away. I'm sorry you're having to go through this at such a difficult time."
"I'd respond with the salt emoji, but I'm kind of childish lol."
"Dude, do you notice a certain *theme* emerging in the comments?

Get. A. Lawyer.

This is not the moment to be nickel-and-diming about how much equity you might lose. If she plays her cards right she could put you in jail for that bruise and similar. If she loses her mind further you could end up in hospital or dead."
"Your wife is 100% justified in being pissed off at you over this.

Yes, your sister continued her pattern of bad behavior and she was definitely the fulcrum of this issue.

You never asserted yourself to your family, though. You let them put you at the kid's table and you never needed to be there. I can understand her desire to lay low and let you handle it, and you let her down by being a doormat about the issue.

I'm guessing you're the classic ""peacemaker"" type, and people like you are a huge asset to society and interpersonal relationships. There are times when ""peacemaker"" becomes a nice word for ""doormat"" though.

You're concerned about your sister doing a cannon ball into the placid waters of family, but I think your concern is misplaced. What you should be focusing on is: how do I make sure I don't leave my wife high and dry like this again?"
You can unfollow her without blocking her and she won’t know.
"Yeah, but it COULD mean that you just miss your friend, which of course you do! 

It also could very well mean that you have more romantic-adjacent feelings for him than you previously thought. You probably have to sit with it for a while. 

The scary truth is that the best you can do is go with your gut. Listen hard to what you think your gut is telling you, and then go do whatever crazy, scary, idiot thing it tells you. No matter what, you'll be ok. 

PS: All male friends don't fall for all female friends. Someone told you that above and I hope that you don't heed that too much and never try to make male friendships again. That would be a shame. "
Since you're an adult you could tell her that she could either buy it for your sister and let you get a place of your own or that she buys an appartment for you and one for your sister so she has even more bragging rights.
"No, he's her uncle. He doesn't deserve any civility here. She needs to block him now. "
"Jumping on, OP, this is honestly like reading something I've written. My parents are the SAME WAY down to the fact theyre putting me through law school. They are currently (at least my mother is) engaged with doubting everything I do because they want me to live my life a certain way. After a lot of therapy, I have learned to keep them at arms length because otherwise, I might just go off the deep end. Being a ""good"" son/daughter just isn't worth it when the definition of good is controlled by people who are trying to jerk you around and manipulate you, even if they think they're doing whats right."
"This is a partner I definitely wouldn't want, OP. 
You're both young, sure, but I personally couldn't see myself with someone so irresponsible...

This is the kind of person who will make you bankrupt over custom curtains she bought from JCPenny that don't actually fit the window."
"What possible answer can she give to ""why did we break up"" which is going to make you feel better?

The most constructive thing you have done here is to block her on social media. Keep her blocked. She is not the person to comfort you and by trying to do so you are staying emotionally entangled.
"
"Perhaps he's subconsciously more stressed about money than you realise. If he used to have money, maybe being on a tighter budget is stressing him out. When you have 5 euro to spend on a coffee, you don't think about how much that coffee costs, you just buy it, but when you're worried about money it seems like a big deal. You're thinking about how that 5 euro could've bought a loaf of bread and some milk.

You've said that sometimes he has no money left and sometimes he has 200-300 extra. If sometimes he doesn't have any money, then this isn't really extra. It's what he needs to keep himself afloat in the times when there isn't any extra money.

Would it be possible to talk about budgeting with him? Frame it as you being concerned because he always seems stressed out about money and you want to help, and then, if he agrees, see what his finances are like. Together, you can figure out what he has the money for and figure out what activities you guys can do together without breaking the bank and without stressing him out."
"&gt;father/daughter relationship disgusting

yeah not going to lie, huge red bad flags.

you need to break it off with him, no offense but it sounds like if you stay and despise their relationship that much, i foresee nothing but hellish times where the kid will need mental help because the mom nearly hated her and kept her from having a good relationship with dad."
Breaking the skin and continuing after you have seriously told him to stop is unacceptable and abusive. This is a huge red flag that he can’t see the difference between goofing around and causing someone actual pain. Get away from him before he escalates. 
"If he was 3 months old when his mother died, he probably doesn't have any grief about it. "

"No big deal, that's how communication works. If you want a proposal that's not cliched, it's good that he knows. It's actually sweet that he blushed and hinted that he's proposing sometime.

IMO proposals are way overrated. If the couple have communicated about what they want, it's no surprise. If they haven't, it's kind of weird and pushy.

In the end, proposal or not, it's about enjoying yourselves and committing to each other."

For logistics, write everything down. Start a log of all of your assets, back up all of your conversations, emails and texts, and if you can, have it in writing that he acted alone and you had no knowledge of what he did. 

Protect yourself, because you don't know what he is capable of at this point. When you break up with him, have someone with you. Also it is good to help you pack up and take your belongings as you move. 

You are very strong. I'm glad you're getting out of there. Stay safe."
"I completely missed the ""10 months"" part.  Oh, Hell No!  

OP, get out!  Seriously, run!  This guy isn't worth it."
"Jesus Christ, OP I'm so sorry you're in this situation that sounds terrifying and hellish 

This man is an abusive psycho, and your main priority right now needs to be protecting current and future you. You did what you had to do to get out of there, and I'm really proud of you for handling it as well as you did. For now, go full lockdown and document his every move, because chances are you're going to need proof for a court day. If you can't get real security cameras set up in your apt, try jury-rigging a tablet to record your front door and living room. Screenshot and triple-save every threatening text he's sent you. Finally, once you've taken every precaution to make your home safe, send him a final message saying that the relationship is over, he is never to contact you again, and if he harasses you you'll go to the police. 

If this goes to court, you want an obscenely clear paper trail that he is abusive and dangerous. 

Good luck, we here on Reddit are here for you however we can be!"
"That's the thing! The mom is screwing up really badly here trying to be fair.

"Yuck. 

I'm a guy, and yuck. 

Just please don't make your son feel bad about this. Use it as a way to communicate about how to have meaningful and symbiotic friendships with future women. "
"&gt; That I always take things too seriously. That I'm ruining his fun. That he thinks we're close enough for him to feel comfortable to make these jokes ""but I guess not""...

That’s emotional manipulation and abuse. It's covert and hard to see that it is, but it’s a manipulation tactic. He is invalidating your feelings. Abuse doesn’t start out big, it starts small and becomes bigger stuff over time. He is absolutely controlling you with tactics like this."
"Maybe it's not what you meant, but since it's kind of a harmful stereotype, I do think it should be mentioned that some men DO completely lose the urge to have sex with their partner. Especially men who have depression/are medicated for depression.

While I believe that what KrytenKoro said is likely true, and regardless of cheating/not cheating, the OP's ex is despicable, lots of men and women lose their sex drive due to depression or depression meds. Even people who love their partner and want to have sex, it's a struggle."
"""I understand you have some special items for (stepson) and thats special and appreciated. Of course we want to ensure the special items he has are really worth holding onto through the years. We think it would be wonderful if you wanted to choose (3, 4, 5?) special items for him to have. Things like clothing or toys won't age or travel well with him throughout his life, so maybe something he can really keep safe and special is best.""

This way you aren't telling her to stop (for the love of god!), but you are explaining that it can't be anything and everything; she needs to be thoughtful about the items, and that's a nice limit. 

But if this behavior has gotten worse, can your husband reach out to her family?? Could be early signs of dementia. "
"*him/he
Otherwise very true."
So you were separated for 4mths and doing nothing to repair your relationship and you are surprised that he still wants a divorce? A separation is only effective if both parties work on the relationship during this time. 
"You are not being unreasonable, it's your house! Time to set some firm boundaries/rules with Mom. Be firm and clear, let her know that her stuff needs to stay in her room only, and if this continues to be a problem she will have to find another place to stay. "
"I really appreciate your comment. I was 75% done with another rant, making all sorts of explanations as to why I have helped her so much, but decided to not make excuses.

I have been trying to convince myself that this thought is wrong, too critical, or outright mean. But when all is said and done, whether or not she is truly selfish, taking advantage of me, or fooling me; or if she is truly just irresponsible, clumsy, and immature... It really doesn't matter. Because regardless of her intentions or lack there of, I am still the one dealing with it. And both falling for her tricks, or carrying her weight, result in her not growing as a person."
And you've been living with him for about half of that? Why did you move in with him so soon? 
"Are the horses well cared for? You might want to call animal control if they don't have enough space or aren't getting enough to eat. Horses are beautiful but expensive animals, and if your family can't provide for them, then they really should be in a different situation. "
"Her reasons for not wanting to be with you keep changing. That probably means that she's simply lost interest. There doesn't have to be a logical reason for it. She's been with you her entire adult life--this might have more to do with just wanting to experience life as a more independent person, than even she realizes."
"Some STDs can be cured and others can be managed and not spread. Talk to your doctor. 

A lot of people have STDs and still have relationships. I don't know how common it is where you live but it's not the end of everything. Try to establish a connection first, wait for sex, and then be honest about it and what you have done to make sure that it is safe for your partner. "
"Nope, you can't contract away  your child support obligations.  You have to formally be a surrogate, have your parental rights terminated by a court and have the non-bio parent be able to adopt.  All of that depends on the state whether it is possible and how to go about it."
"Do you have kids? You can't have the same kind of sex or even just fun you would if the house is empty. Maybe they want to get drunk, blare music and have loud sex. Would you want to hear that?

And I just read his reply, I wouldn't let my 13 year old spend the night at his girlfriend's either, that how you end up with a teenage pregnancy. And OP admits his friend's parents let them do whatever they want. Those are shitty alternative options."
"Your 30-year-old boyfriend lives with his much-younger girlfriend in her mom's house and doesn't pay rent or work or do housework.  I'm going to guess he also doesn't do much in the way of job-hunting, or you probably would have mentioned how hard he was pounding the pavement.  He bosses you around and makes you responsible for his emotions.  He is threatened by your activities outside of him.  He guilt-trips you and says mean things to you.

Where's the part where he's supportive?  It's not financial support, it's not emotional support and it's not support for you as a healthy, whole individual who exists separately from him.

This does not sound like a healthy relationship."
Yeah I agree with this too. Not great to use your girl friend as your emotional regulation crutch.
"Before your mom deletes the posts and locks everything down, I'd actually have her post a few more about a trip you are taking somewhere else. Find some pictures of the location on Google Image and have her post them as if she took them while there with you. Have her tag you in them. This could buy you a little more time to do all the above with going to the police and getting a RO."
"&gt;She's moving away with my son, leaving me with a massive house that I now need to rent out after I finish it. I'm fucked in the meantime.

I know y'all aren't married, but I'd consider speaking with an attorney. This is *not* okay and I'd be surprised if there was no recourse for someone in your situation.

I'm sorry this has happened to you, OP :("

"I really think you should go the police, he assaulted you and then admitted it in writing. You could also get a restraining order against him so he has to move. Definitely tell your boyfriend."
Distance yourself from her ASAP. You don't want to end up in legal and social trouble for sex crimes just because this person has a tenuous grasp on reality or is wilfully malicious.
"&gt; He tells me every single day how beautiful I am, how much he loves me, and so on but then he says things like that and it just hurts.

Imagine how painful it is for him that all the love he shows you doesn't mean a damn thing, because you'll believe a passing joke over it.

Yes, you're hella sensitive.

&gt; Because I just don't find that funny, and I never will.

Sure. You guys are a bad match and should break up.

You should *also* get therapy, because if you're going to (as you yourself said) obsess over every negative and ignore the positive, then you're not going to be a good match for *anybody*.

&gt; it either comes down to changing 

Yeah, OP, you really owe it to yourself to change.

&gt; But like your husband, I know there are men out there that do not find that kind of joke funny (or, even if they did, would never make it).

There may be men like that. There's going to be way fewer men who are able to tolerate your disbelieving of his constant compliments in favor of insisting there's a ""seed of truth"" in the occasional teasing."
"It's over. Cut contact with your ex and don't bother with him ever again. It's generally a bad idea to sleep with your ex's friend/coworker so avoid that in the future, but in your particular case, getting back with your ex was a huge mistake anyway. Wanna know how I know? My ex broke up with me *four times* with no apparent reason, in order to teach me a lesson. The kind of person who does this once will do it again and again and again. This would've been your life with this dude. You'd be walking on eggshells, trying to avoid the next breakup to no avail. It is a miserable way to exist.  "
"I once woke up while having sex with my husband. When we finished, it turned out that he *also* woke up while having sex.  One of us started in our sleep, we have no idea who, and then the other responded, still in their sleep too.  It was pretty weird."
"Totally agree, most answers are displaying that Star wars is totally fine and she is overreacting to the point OP should end it with her. 
I support your idea, Star wars was just there at the Moment she became enraged and you already pointed out why that happened. 
She obviously wanted to spent time with OP, he himself admitted that she got excited about it! And suddenly he left her alone because he has seen what he wanted to see. 
If he would have communicated something like:""i'll watch the first half with you, okay? There is a New trailer coming out."" I think she would have understood but it seems like OP did not confront her with the real intention until it was over "
"When I was in the military, co-workers would show me naked pics of their wives and girlfriends on their cell phone all the time. I also got naked on Skype once for my ex-husband while he was deployed, someone else apparently watched it too and tried to pretend to be him and told me to get naked again. It was mortifying. Also as soon as your naked pics/vids are stolen or someone else sees them, you don't get any help because everyone says you were dumb for taking naked pics in the first place. 

Anyway good luck with your talk, I hope he comes around! "
"Only you can decide if you do not want to be married to her any longer. It sounds like she didn't want to be the ""50s housewife"" [as per the words you used in your post] but she fully expected you to be the ""50s breadwinner husband."" I don't understand what she was doing with all of her time. As someone who is immigrating to another country for my husband and unable to work during the process, I do almost ALL of the housework. There are days when I slack off because I'm tired and don't feel well, but I make sure he doesn't feel like he needs to do anything. [ex: I'll tell him I'll do the dishes tomorrow] He will occasionally help out wish dishes or take the trash out though. It is very awkward to be in a different country [even though in your situation, US and Canada aren't super different], with no real support system but your spouse. I'm not sure how it was in your situation, but did she have many friends or your family around? It gets very lonely when your SO is out working and you really don't have anything to do or anyone to talk to. Is it possible she may have been [and possibly still] dealing with depression? 

If you want your marriage to work, or are willing to try and make it work, I highly suggest you go to couples counseling together. If you don't want to make it work, then you need to have that conversation with her."
Well thats a whole different story then-you should add this to your OP
"I'm a bit confused by the responses as well.

 So Jane gets invited to their place, then OP proceeds to get hysterical, yell and cry about it, until Jane feels so awkward that she leaves. OPs bf apologizes, not OP, because she feels she doesn't need to? Why should bf apologize in her stead??

Then there are other incidents that have made Jane dislike OP. She mentions in the post that she forgets to mind her manners, I'm curious about what that means exactly.

It seems that it wasnt just the yelling/crying incident that caused this current rift, but compounded incidents, with the hysteria being the most explosive one. If I knew someone who behaved this way, I would not invite them to much either. 

It's really up to OPs bf if he wants to continue to hurt OPs feelings by going to these events without her. I would be upset if my boyfriend for doing that as well, but I'm hesitant to blame it all in Jane here. OP &amp; bf can always look into creating their own parties to invite the group to. "
"This.  I'm a sexual assault survivor, sometimes my boyfriend makes jokes in the moment when we're tired and unfiltered that could be construed as joking about sexual assault.  I look at him, he looks at me, looks down, and profusely apologizes.  I say ""it's okay, I know we're least filtered with each other and stuff comes out"" he says ""I'm so sorry, I wasn't thinking, I should've been thinking, I'm so sorry,"" and we kiss and hold each other and it's all okay.

If he got defensive about it or said ""that's just how I talk""....nope.  Nope nope nope, I couldn't be in that relationship."
"Do over baby. I know of stepparents who were the magical dad to their stepchild, but not much involved with their own kids two decades earlier.

However, it can't hurt to give Luke the tools he would need to understand sexual situations and to talk to you about it. That means that he needs to know the correct words for genitals. He also needs to know that only he is allowed to touch his genitals (exceptions for the doctor or you in case of illness). And that he can come and talk to you about anything and that he is the most important thing in your life. 

Just in case something weird is happening. "

"It's not the question itself. It's that it was the *sole point* used as the deflection, rather than answering the question. It is highly indicative of agreeing with the mindset of those communities.

He didn't say, ""yes [no], I am [not] involved in those communities,"" he simply deflected it by saying ""well, I treat you well, right?"" It shows that he believes he is allowed to think and say whatever he wants as long as he is nice enough to her.

He has a conflict of interest with regards be nice to her. Therefore, that point doesn't really hold up here."
"&gt; ""favor sharking"".

Very appropriate term. He doesn't want money back, he wants other favors, so ""It's okay, I've taken care of it, don't worry about it!"" still means ""You owe me"" later.

&gt; (OP) He says he feels like I'm only dating him because he has a real job, whereas most guys my age are broke.

I'm not surprised he brought this up either, this kind of power difference is why we side-eye age gaps like this in the first place. Now he leaves it up to you to ""prove yourself"" to him that you aren't just with him for his walled (even though that was never in question until you didn't have sex with him like he expected you to)."
"Good point BUT I would actually say the transactional nature of this experience might make him see sex as something someone else does FOR him rather than something that they seek and enjoy in their own right. In this way, the removal of the healthy albeit difficult negotiations around sex might lead to him skipping or avoiding them later. And of course he still hasn't learned them and it sounds like that was what was tripping him up in the first place, not the complex mechanics of penis in vagina hehe

Hey and I'm really sorry this happened to you. And stuffed with such personal and significant issues as sex and love. I'm glad you've worked out where to stand and am strong enough to share that with us!"

"I’d request it from his office (not the surgeon directly) - if you want it to be less obvious, request a copy of ALL your charts and signed forms.

"Man, I was a manager of a video store for years and one of our regular customers was a deaf man about my same age, who just so happened to also check IDs at the door of the dive bar I went to all the time. 

He would usually only come in during the day to rent movies, so there weren't a lot of people, but every now and then he'd come in on a busier evening. At least a quarter of the times that happened, some impatient asshole would start getting vocally upset that we were spending extra time with him. I just started flat out saying to those assholes ""he's deaf"" and they'd shut right the hell up."
"This is completely unrelated, but I've been in Time Square twice for New Year's Eve, and it was totally overrated both times.

The first time I stood in Time Square for 12+ hours. That was fucking terrible.

The second time, I was invited to a party in a hotel that overlooked Time Square. That was decent, but totally not worth the price. 

New Years Eve is about having fun with your friends/family, not focusing on the ball all night long.

The best New Years Eves I've had were at the bar with friends or at family get-togethers. You spend a grand total of 10 min watching the ball drop on TV and spend the rest of your night doing your own thing."
"&gt;But I feel like my dad is really only been a ""part time dad"" whereas my step dad has been there for everything

That's really all that needs to be said. Your dad had the opportunity to be a father, he failed at that. He can be as upset as he wants but that's not going to change the past and it's not going to change your current feelings. If anything, he's probably reinforcing those feelings. 

At the end of the day, this is **your** wedding. Your dad can be upset, but he brought this on himself when he chose to be a shittier father than someone who isn't even biologically related to you. That's not a jab at your step-dad, he's clearly fucking awesome and deserves all the love he's getting. Bio-dad, not so much apparently. His desire to walk you down the aisle is selfish. He doesn't want to walk you down the aisle because of the amazing dad he's been, but because it's a status symbol. Because it might be embarrassing for him that in a public setting, you're saying ""this guy was a better father"". But it's true and you shouldn't shy away from that. 

It's your wedding, do it your way. It's supposed to be the happiest damn day of your life so don't you let him bring you down. "
Funny how he keeps doing the thing he's apologetic about... might almost suggest he's being disingenuous.
"Too bad too sad. Look either you want to deal with this or not. Stop acting like your husband: he doesn't want to make his family feel bad or like he is attacking them, now you don't want to make him feel bad or like you are attacking him. Requiring your husband to financially prioritize his own wife and child is not an attack."
"LOL is that what he told you? Men still produce sperm all their lives, but there are working parts within the testes that rapidly stop working as well after 40. Rates of autism, schizophrenia, retardation, and attention-deficit disorders all increase after that cutoff. It gets worse with time, too, so if you wanted kids ideally it would be in the next couple years."
No one says this shit to young parents. You know what else isn't reversible? Children.
"It depends on what they are. As long as it includes every food group and a small variety of fruits/vegetables, youll probably be okay. 

Ive seen some dieticians suggest you try to get each color of the rainbow every week, which is only 5 or 6 fruits/vegetables and you can get two or three in one meal.

Humans dont need HUGE variety. But you do need SOME variety.

If this guy were eating chicken and broccoli alfredo for every meal, it would be a smaller deal because thats got a protein and vegetable at least and he could make the sauce from scratch to make it healthier. Not ideal still.

 But if this guy is literally eating only kraft mac and cheese, thats no vegetables or fruit at all. The only protein is a neon orange cheese powder.

"Ok, OP, you sound legitimately awesome:

1. Double majoring in two demanding fields. 
2. Empowered enough to break away from your abusive family. 
3. Financially self-sufficient at a very young age, with what sounds like a solid understanding of money and a great work ethic. 
4. Self-aware and thoughtful with appropriate boundaries. 
5. A good communicator. 


Seriously, those qualities are all pretty rare to begin with, so to find them combined in one individual is *beyond impressive*. 

Add to that the fact you are conventionally attractive enough to work in a gentleman’s club, and you’re damn near a Mary Sue in terms of being the ideal catch!

Your boyfriend on the other hand, well I’ve met *a lot* of guys like him: male feminists who have a surprisingly rigid definition of the ‘right’ way for women to behave. Sometimes it manifests as an objection to make-up (“you’re just pandering to the male gaze!”), or belittling non-STEM majors (“You shouldn’t waste your intelligence on liberal arts, you could be a good coder if you tried!”) or *choice of occupation*. 

By refusing to accept your choice, he’s showing that he thinks HIS reasoning trumps YOUR reasoning about **your** life choices. 

Even if your reasoning for working at the club was just “I enjoy the delicious free bar snacks,” he’d have no right to keep haranguing you to quit. The fact you have serious financial reasons to keep this job is just the icing on the cake. 

Next time he brings this up, I’d be VERY clear that he’s disrespecting you. 

&gt; “But OP, I just think you’re some much better than working in a—
&gt;”Stop right there. It is MY choice where I work. By continuing to harass me about that choice—and yes, it’s harassment at this point—you’re being disrespectful. Do you think you know better than me how to run my life? If the answer to that is yes, then this relationship is over. If you agree that I’m an adult capable of making choices in my own best interest, then you will **never** bring up my employment again. If you do, then I’ll know you don’t respect my atonomy, and we’ll be over. **This is not up for discussion, and this is the last warning you’ll get.**

Or just break up with him now, because you’re the whole package and he’s kinda an entitled dumbass. Your choice!

Either way, keep kicking ass. I hope my daughter grows up to be as strong and self-sufficient as you!

"I don't think it's crazy and I don't think you're crazy for doing it. I don't see any harm in what you are doing and I completely understand the need to change things for ease of the telling. The difference with OP is that it was done in front of her when she was part of the conversation and she knows she didn't do those things in her MILs stories. It put her in a really awkward spot. But your son probably doesn't know the difference and wouldn't remember anyway, so it seems pretty harmless to me. I'm very sorry for your loss. "

There is so much wrong with this being his first sexual experience. Poor kid is being set up for a really, really unhealthy sexual life."
Thank you. That was very nice of you and you're right. I was a really good partner to her. I didn't deserve this from her.

"I believe she has established residency at their house, given the amount of time she has been there. Absent a signed leasing agreement between her and the homeowners (your parents), I think many states default to an assumed month-to-month lease.

Your parents can ask her to leave, but realize that she has a right to live there now. Worst case scenario involves your parents notifying her that her lease is up and that she needs to be moved out by a month from now. If she refuses, they will need to start a legal eviction process.

Best of luck."
"And don't tell him you cheated on him. He doesn't need to deal with that extra pain of your betrayal. Telling him now is selfish, just like cheating on him was. "
Wow. Being in a bad mood isn't an excuse to be an abusive asshole. Some of what he said is definite instant dealbreaker category and you shouldn't try to move past it if you don't want to.
"Normally I’d consider issues of consent when someone is intoxicated, but he admitted pressing her against a wall and kissing her. He had intent. If you forgive him, just know he’ll likely cheat again.  

If your four years together weren’t consecutive, how old were you when you first got with him?"
Clearly.  It's the worst thing to be.
"Absolutely this. 

I also think couples counseling makes sense before any marriage, but especially here. Your partner is older, grew up with more traditional gender roles, and previously only dated women. They assumed they'd be the one to propose to the extent they never even discussed it with you. It sounds like their understanding of your relationship might be different to your own - one where they're taking on some traditional male caregiving/protecting/decision-making role. I'd want to be very sure where I stood and that I was being seen as an equal partner before getting married."
And ALL of you need to work on your misogyny and equating women with passivity and submission. 'Feminine role' smh 
"I understand this. There's more to it than just feelings though. If it hasn't begun already, your husband's attitude about this is going to end up negatively affecting the child you already have together, nevermind any you might be considering having in the future. Prioritizing FOO over a spouse, tension at home, and even possibly compromising your ability to pay for things your child needs- these are the things your child will grow up with, and none of them a good example to set."
My fiancé spent $200+ on a necklace for his co-worker. I was that co-worker.

"No he wasn't laughing in a ""haha this is so funny"" way. Sorry I should have made that clearer. It was like an awkward, weird-situation, exasperated laughing. I get that he wasn't laughing at me, but I dunno I was in a weird headspace and it just made me mad."
"Your post history is ... dramatic.  If troll, fun times.  If serious, you have had a rough couple of weeks."
"For everyone telling you your child is a monster, I'm gonna say I was raised a bit differently and had to grow out of thinking hurting animals wasn't a big deal. I just learned that hurting things to hurt them was a terrible thing after seeing an animal actually hurt. My family taught me that animals are below us and pest control is totally okay...even if it might be a pet cat.

I also went to a child therapist a few sessions because a cousin tried to touch me while I slept and I yelled for my mom getting him caught in the acr. My mom wanted to make sure I wasn't permanently scarred from the event. It was very lame. All I remember is coloring pictures and answering yes and no questions and then her ranting that nothing was my fault and I didn't do anything to deserve what happened to me even if u wasn't showing I was affected.

My dad once took me to a prairie dog field for target practice. I thought it would be like a video game. After he shot one, I felt really sick to my stomach and now I catch and release every spider in my home to make up for that prairie dog.

Your son could use an unbiased party to tell him hurting animals isn't okay. I'd tell my husband ""I don't think hurting animals is acceptable, and that's a hard line for me. Son and me has an appointment with the school counselor or a kid therapist just to get another opinion from someone who isn't his parents. Maybe this is normal, maybe he needs to learn it, but I want to have peace of mind about it. It worries me. You can come if you want, I'd prefer you were there.""

I dunno, I'd treat it like another kid doctor appointment to my spouse and he'd probably go ""oh I didn't know you felt so strongly about it"" and ask how it went....because I'd just do it. You don't ask your husband permission to get the kid to the doctor when he's sick..."
"Hate to work, play music and play guitar with my ring.  Wife got me a silicone one and I forget it's there.  It was super cheap too.  Actually it makes me frustrated because I remember when we picked out our rings all I heard was ""you want to have a nice one that will last forever"". $1000 later, it will last forever alright, because it sits in a case.  I wear the $10 one everyday."
"BS. You were being a passive aggressive jack ass, you just now are trying to get your ass out of the dog house. Grow up, even if your wife wasn't there why do that? You make your wife the butt of your jokes so what else have ya said? "
I’m so sorry but I laughed out loud at this comment. 
"From one of OP's other comments:

&gt; They really hate gay people, think they should be killed or inprisoned like back in our home country. They're racist to certain groups and have sexist views (I've been called loose by extended family for going to uni because ""women don't need higher education ""

Her parents aren't reasonable at all. I also suspect their attitudes towards women are part of why they're being so hostile towards her."
This comment has really helped. Thank you.
"I'd say the best way to avoid getting too afraid of something is to expose yourself to it before it gets too difficult. Say, if you're genuinely worried, make a point to eat one food outside of your usual list once a week. Have it be a different one each week. If that feels difficult, start with just changing one ingredient. I doubt it's a problem to just rotate through the same foods if they just cover all the necessary nutrients... But having the *ability* to eat other things too is something you should nurture. If one of the things you eat gets discontinued/you develop an allergy/new research proves it to be unhealthy... you will have more flexibility to adjust your diet. "
"There's a difference between being fastidious and a genuine OCD.

The term is often carelessly bandied about but in this case the OPs wife appears to have an genuine obsessive disorder -- repeatedly cleaning.

An analogy:

Checking the door once or twice to make sure it's locked is being careful.  Checking the door over and over and even coming home to recheck the door is an OCD."
Not making a decision is also a kind of decision. By not choosing to stay with you she's choosing to stay with your sister.
"&gt; I've tried discussing her taking on some bills but it always ends in argument in that she says ""At least you have a place to live"" because I moved in with her.

Interesting. Commonly, living together is an implicit part of marriage! The fact she's leading with this shows where her head is at... and it doesn't seem to be as part of a couple. It does seem you're being used right now, and marriage a convenient cloak over it.

"
"Yeah, if you can't tell Tom that you guys don't want to hang out with him anymore, then maybe make him not want to hang out with you guys. Don't let him get away with stupid shit. Tell him when he's being selfish or rude or ignorant. Tell him he's inconsiderate of other people. Call him the fuck out. Make him feel uncomfortable instead of allowing him to make all of you uncomfortable."
"Yes, but the question is will they *ever* be able to afford one if she's with him.

He committed to being in that place twice already. Yet he's making it clear he's no closer. There's some sympathy to be had there, because life catches you off guard sometimes, but if he doesn't have a concrete plan then ""Is a responsible person"" is not enough reason to stay in a marriage that won't fulfill a major thing.

You can be 100% in the right and still not be the right person for a given relationship."
"Well for starters, for god's sake no, don't report her. Her cousin would likely be deported back to the country he came from, which you didn't specify but said was unsafe/terrible conditions, and that would be an unbelievably shitty thing to do, it's not his fault she didn't tell you. 

However, this is a massive, massive secret she kept from you and you are 100% right to be upset about it. It's certainly a potential deal breaker. If you want to leave her, that's up to you. No one here would blame you for that, I don't think. "
"Also, I want to point out that, forget Sarah, OP's other friends aren't that great, either.  Seriously, once they find out the parties didn't merge, not a single person spoke up and said, ""Hey, we should save some energy and not get wasted so we can help OP celebrate her 21st?"""
"Studies about near death experiences are all self-selecting, self-reporting, anecdote.  It's a little tricky to do RCTs, you know? "
Woo! I love happy endings. 
"Your comment seemed strange and shocking -- that you know 
""many women"" who've made false rape claims because of ""this feminism trend"". Then I glanced at your comment history and saw that you believe that the Las Vegas massacre was faked, and that the Harvey Weinstein story is being blown out of proportion to distract people from the fake massacre, so I feel better about the false allegations of false rape. Cheers. "
"Same first thought. 10 year olds have no idea what the opposite sex finds attractive, they’re too young. Maybe if the age range was 12 or 13+, I could see your assumption being geared towards attracting the opposite sex with their costume. "
She has the right to make that decision. This child has no connection but via a father she despises and she has every right to refuse contact.
"He is asking you politely to smoke further away from the house. He is not ordering you. Your bf can tell him it would be inconvenient to go farther away, so he will need to close his window. No harm in trying to be accommodating if possible, maybe go for a short walk (if its safe) instead of standing next to the house. "
"I think you're extrapolating a lot. Those things *might* be the case, but there is zero indication that any of that is happening from OPs post. 

&gt;I see a one-way relationship here... 

Really? That might be because OP is having a *specific* problem and is asking for advice? He's not here to give us the full details of his relationship, which would be nearly impossible in a Reddit post anyway. 

This sub isn't to make stuff up and tear OP apart without cause. This sub is here to take the information we're given and to give advice based on that information. "
Wear a condom - you really don't want to catch one.

"Most people don't break up over a diet. Sounds like there is a deeper power struggle and this is how it manifests itself. I'm sorry you don't feel understood and accepted by your significant other, OP :("
"Divorced without kids in my 40s here, lots of money and time to do things in the world and not a single soul to do them with. I could fall off the face of the planet tomorrow and nobody would notice except my remote co-workers (might take them a week), and my elderly parents (also might take them a week). Also impossible to make age-appropriate friends in my area (the South) because I don't have a large family and I don't do kid stuff. 

I don't regret not having any, because I know they wouldn't have made me happy, but damn, I wish more other people would have made the decision not to either. And a lot of people with kids seem unhappier than I am, albeit not as lonely. Sometimes I think adulthood just sucks hard no matter what choices you make."
You're skipping over everything you've done that offended her. Here you're making it her fault by referencing her sensitivities. The fact that you're not going into detail makes me think you're hiding something about your behaviour. 
"&gt; we're both afraid not knowing how to start living after breaking...

This has become a relationship of convenience and codependency."
"Also wanted to mention that she may be projecting onto you. You said she has a best friend who is a male? I mean, that's fine I guess, but my SO is my best friend. I confide in her and we work out issues as they arise.

You can bet that she is telling him everything you're doing ""wrong"". And he is agreeing with her. Not to say they have a relationship, but that is approaching emotional cheating. You should be her rock, not some other guy."
"Balkans right...

you've got people telling you this is absolutely not normal in serbia...

but it actually is...sure prostitution is illegal but that doesn't change the fact.

Check out the movie ""Rane"" (wounds) from 98.

It's a war comedy/drama... where this war thug takes three boys to lose their virginities... it's horrible actually... but in the balkans this is comedy.

he was born in 1970's , left for america before the 90's.. so he has that classic 80's yugoslav mindset.

This might not be ""normal"" but it absolutely is not abnormal.

"
Yeah man..she's COMPLETELY unreasonable.
"&gt;  He said yes, but that Liza had practically forced him to do it.

And he has so little self-control that he just couldn't say no!

C'mon, OP. Either this guy is feeding you a pile of bullshit, or he has no moral meter."
"Don't get me wrong ...I 100% believe that he was actually sick and not lying. And I'm very understanding of why they might not eat to reach out day of the wedding, but I waited five days before reaching out myself and that actually bothers me. I feel like they could have sent even just a text congratulations. "
"oh, I really hope he can get over this because the two of you sound like the loveliest couple! Can you talk to him about the fact that you've only been making this money for a small fraction of your partnership and that it changes *nothing*? If you guys are getting married, that's supposed to mean that a win for one of you is a win for *both*. It's a partnership, and that's what they're about. "
"&gt; Ask him about it

She did and he *lied to her face.*"
"My mom, who dated a lot of women in college, once told me that my dad was the only man she liked. It’s ok to be the first! It’s probably pretty confusing for her but just be yourself and ask her what she’s comfortable with as you go forward. Don’t let your fear get in the way of you initiating things. It sounds like you guys work well together and have pretty good open lines of communication, so try not to stress! She must think you’re pretty special if you’re the only man she’s ever wanted. "
You mentioned elsewhere that you are going for engineering.  I worked in one of my professors lab part time as an engineering student. I got to run experiments and help write up some research papers. I got to be second author on a few published paper which looks great on a resume and I got paid better than 99% of other part time jobs. My advice is to make a list of professors who do research that you have an interest in and learn a bit about it and set up appointments to talk to them. Show them you're interested in what they do and not just the money and then ask if they ever higher research assistants. 
"This girl does have nerve - but I'm 23. I have two kids of my own, a husband, a house and a great income. A 14yo is not my peer. "
"&gt;I actually don't understand why you wouldn't tell your partner the truth about your friend situation

I don't understand how he doesn't already know her friend situation. They've been together for *seven years.* He has to have realized she has no friends. "
"If he's a moderately famous person, or represents a moderately famous company, he probably needs to keep an eye out for scandals.

Even if it has nothing to do with him, the hive mind will still fuck up his life because we think it did.

Coming out and denying a scandal too early looks guilty and gives fuel to the fire, and credibility to your accusers. If you ignore it, odds are it will just die out and your accusers will move on. 

However, if it starts to gain traction and you ignore it for too long looks like you're guilty and hiding.  The timing on when to act is tricky and it helps if you've been watching it play out from the beginning."
"I am going to give advise that is against the grain. Go on a date. My wife is my best friend in the world and it makes every single day a delight. I am not saying to marry him. But, go on a date. Kiss him. See if sparks fly. If no sparks, you break his heart and lose a best friend. But that also happens if you do nothing. But if it clicks and it works out you just guaranteed that at least one aspect of your life will be great. What do you have to lose. I am rooting for you two."
"Anddd, done! :)

Luckily, boyfriend is not friends with him on Facebook and he's only said hello to him in passing. He's very friendly, sweet and sensitive though, so I'll be giving him a heads up that this guy might talk to him like crap. Don't want him to be caught off guard."
"You have the right to make your own choices.  So do they.

&gt;What should I do to not look like asshole #1?

Way too late for that.

You're taking a stance over something that had nothing to do with you and you're only hearing the part of the story that you want to.

Accept the fact that by excluding Toby, you will wind up cutting other people out of your life as well.  If you are at peace with that, then act accordingly."
"If she talks about other people behind their backs, she's talking about you behind your back too..."
"Yes my neighbor was very kind. I just can't stop feeling embarrassed. Like this will sound so vain but my hair was crazy, my makeup was smeared everywhere, my face just looked bad. I feel like I was just huge neon sign of ""I'M A HUGE MESS"". He must have been so ... I don't know. Horrified? Disgusted? It was just so bad that day.

I really wish it all just didn't happen but it did, and he was there, and now it's on me to try to make it less horrible."

"That's weird, 28 year olds who get with teens almost never play weird mind games. 


&gt;I know he also has a high sex drive and is always the one to initiate sex or at least foreplay

&gt;I feel shamed for liking sex


He's fucking with your mind, this is some kind of weird gaslighting thing. "
"I mean, he doesn't have to refuse to go because he's taking a stand about her not being invited.  He can just not go because he'd personally prefer to spend Christmas with his partner and keep his commitment to going on a trip with her.

To me, this would be a ""why would he even consider going when he already has plans to go on a trip with his SO and she wouldn't be welcome to join them?"" Not because SOs have to be invited on such things, but because you don't suddenly cancel plans to go on a trip with your SO to do something else instead if the alternate plans would exclude them and leave them alone.

They're 24 and live together, a trip with his family shouldn't be more important than a trip he'd previously discussed with his SO."
This story is already sounding really fictional. This error reinforces that. 
"I've been considering writing a memoir. I have several essays from both before and after the divorce, plus a handful of poems, and I envisioned one as ""An Open Letter To You (You Know Exactly Who You Are)"". I know she'd read it because she's read my prior work."
"I totally understand where you're coming from in not wanting to have a baby when you're basically covering your bills every month &amp; not doing much else. 

But when did you first revisit having kids at 27? Did that conversation get delayed until around her birthday? If so, she probably felt incredibly frustrated that you knew you weren't ready for a baby but waited until the ""deadline"" to mention that. A few years down the line, without any significant progress in the things you want to improve before having kids, she may feel like she's just in the second phase of the stall tactic, where she waits until she's 30 to find out you're still not ready. It's a shitty ultimatum, but what she's expressing to you is that having kids is incredibly important to her &amp; that she doesn't want to spend two more years waiting to find out that you're still not ready. Does that mean she's in a logical place right now? Nope. Does it mean it's a good time &amp; you should have that baby? Nope. But that's the takeaway. 

So how important are kids to you? Is it take-it-or-leave-it? Is it leaning more toward a no? Are you interested in working on the things preventing you from starting a family? You don't come across as overly enthusiastic about kids, so it's hard to ignore the possibility that the financial situation is a convenient excuse. If you're not sold on kids, period, then you owe it to your wife to let her know that ASAP. If you want kids &amp; it's really just the financial thing, then come up with a plan of what you can do to improve that. Start applying for better jobs. Etc. If she's giving this ultimatum out of sheer frustration, seeing real progress should be enough of a start. But if she's really at her breaking point where logical steps won't cut it &amp; her only option is to start trying for a baby, then yeah, it might be best to consider divorcing."
"If you go on you YouTube there is a show called freaky eaters that is pretty much exactly this and shows just how difficult it can be to rid someone of this. Professional help, whether it be psychologist or nutritionist, is a necessity."

"From experience, it takes about 18-24 months to truly get over the death of a parent.  And when I say get over I mean be able to calmly talk about their last days, look at pictures without breaking down.  You haven't reached that point yet, so it's perfectly natural to still feel turmoil.

As for your dad, a lot of older men find that they can't cope along and move on very, very quickly.  Your dad was still quicker than most but that's probably due to already having an ongoing relationship.  While he was happy with your mom, he probably moved on K fast because he had to stabilize the remaining relationship he had left after your mom passed away.  In a weird way, it's not building a new life but preserving what he had.  Also, since you weren't privy to the extent of your parents' private lives, it is possible that your mom gave her blessing for them to be married after she passed, so that removed some of the guilt that might have made them slow down.

I'm not sure going on a cruise is a great idea - you will essentially be trapped for 7 days.  Hopefully, you have other close family going that you can lean on.  But if it's just the three of you, then maybe you can gracefully bow out, wish the bride and groom the best and make plans to have a fancy dinner with them when they get back."
"This is a complete supposition, but I remember going through a very similar thing when I was 6, although it wasn't a pattern of mine. Is it possible some other kids made fun of his new backpack and he now wants to get rid of it as a result?"

"Nobody can tell you how to grieve, when you're ready to try dating again, or any of that but yourself. 

No matter what you do, there will always be someone to criticize:
""Didn't grieve long enough, grieved for too long, didn't grieve the right way"" etc etc.

If you feel that you are ready to try dating again you should try. I highly doubt your late wife would want you to be miserable and alone forever.

Make sure you take good care of yourself."
"My brother dated a girl for a couple of months who was deaf and this is how they communicated. My brother doesn't know sign language so it was what worked best. 

I also used to work at a service counter and I communicated with a few deaf clients who didn't bring an interpreter by passing an actual notepad back and forth, so it's not like OP is the only one doing this. I think the girl was just being a catty bitch tbh."
"Sister needs to go to a hospital and get checked for brain damage, if no brain damage is found that excuse is immediately completely invalid.

Aside from that, tell your fiancé. Tell him his sister is not someone you want to be in contact with unless absolutely necessary and that if his mom passes there is no way you (as in you both, not just you personally) will take care of her. Do not wait it out, just speak up. If he does not see what's going on it just means that he cares about his family more than about you. Does not mean you can't marry him, but does mean that if his sister ever makes him choose between you and him (i.e. she wants to move in with you and starts shit with you personally just to create distance between you and your fiancé) he might not choose you.

Tell him of your concerns, tell him of your opinion of his sister. You're getting married, he deserves to know."
"Someone in another comment mentioned how their mom is probably planning to split her life insurance/assets equally between her kids, which is something she has said she’s doing. They mentioned maybe having his sisters portion put in a separate account with someone to handle for her, like maybe my SO. I’m weighing on this idea but I know it’ll be an extremely hard conversation to have. She likes to think she’s independent and would fight it hard, so I’m also wondering if it’d even be worth the trouble. 

I definitely do not want to be paying for her way through life. I’m willing to help in little ways, but there comes a point where a person needs to be 100% self supportive "
"&gt;So what does a 37 year old man see in a woman 14 years his junior

you really have to ask?"
"Tbh, you seem to be looking for reasons to forgive - which I can understand.  Do you want the drugs and booze to be the defining factor in the cheating, so you can rationalize it and move on?  "
"Okay first off, there are marijuana lawyers out there and people with law school backgrounds who are making a ton off your passion.  So there may be ways to combine your passion and your education into a position that can allow you to pay off your loans if you are willing to get creative.

That said, I'm confused as to why you are so resentful of your mother rather than taking responsibility for your own choices.  You were an adult when you applied to law school, took the lsat, made it through/ didn't drop out, etc. If you want to be resentful at least some of that resentment should go on your younger self for not standing up to your mother, pursuing your own passions, etc. Your mother is from a generation and time where going to law school without complete passion for the law was less of the mistake it is today and no parent likes to hear, ""sorry mom, I'm way more passionate about drugs.""  It was your responsibility to stand up to here and it still is.  Instead of complaining about the choices you've made find ways to pursue a life that makes you happy.  That's your responsibility not heres.  Telling her you want to be a marijuana farmer does nothing.  Building yourself a life doing the thing you want to be is how you convince her.  You did this to yourself and continuing to view it as though you were completely passive is what is leading to this resentment.  The best way you move forward is by realizing that you are and were an adult with agency over your own life and the only way you're going to ever be happy is by growing the spine to do what you want to do."
"Yes, very worried. I would never date a redpiller, that's just asking for trouble."
"The most important relationship to foster is the relationship you have with yourself. I see that you're focusing a lot of attention on the lives of your bullies, hoping for some sort of karmic retribution. But how much energy are you focusing on yourself? You can't control what happens to other people, or what they do, but you *can* control your own actions. I really, really suggest talking to a counselor or a therapist because you seem to have a really negative outlook of yourself, and are constantly being defeatist about your own potential. 

Therapy can be so helpful for things that I didn't even realize was wrong with me. There was a time when I felt a lot of people had wronged me, and I wanted nothing except for them to all burn in a giant fire while I danced around the flames, but obviously that wasn't going to happen. Instead of stressing out about stuff I couldn't control, my therapist told me to focus on the things I could. Low grades? Spend more time studying. Friends suck? Seek out new hobbies and meet new people. 


&gt; I always followed the Revenge of the Nerds formula where the bullied kid would end up with a high paying job, a hot gf/wife and an amazing social life, yet that hasn't happened for me.

Take it from someone who sat passively through life for a long time - the thing about life is, if you want something, you have to go out there and get it. Nothing is going to fall in your lap while you spend time wishing you had someone else's life. OP, I think you have a lot of potential, and you're so young. Please, please talk to a professional, and learn to love yourself and live for no one else but yourself. 

If you're interested, I think the book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck"" would be super helpful for you because you're giving too many fucks about people who don't matter in the grand scheme of things! I believe I have the ebook somewhere, so PM me if you'd like to read it :)"
WAY TO BURY THE LEDE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A DOG. Your bf has to LET YOU visit your dad? He doesn't LET YOU stay out over night including at relatives? He threatens to be violent with you because you're upset that he's being violent? WHAT THE FUCK OP. What are you doing. Take a long hard look at your life and your relationship because this shit is so toxic the fumes are making me light headed. 
"I think you did the right thing. If you've known this guy and joke around with him frequently and his comments/threats didn't sound like previous conversations...then yeah,something is off. You followed your gut. As far as ruining his life: he either meant them or didn't. If he didn't then perhaps he'll learn a lesson re: joking around that you're going to kill someone. "
"This includes, by the way, creepy guys who might want to have sex with a 15 year old guys.  They do not want to ""date"" a 15 year old girl, they want to exploit her.

If you (OP) are wondering if you did the right thing because you are imagining a scenario in which he has feelings for her, it is important to understand that in that scenario his actions reflect a basic failure of sanity.  

I do not believe that this is the case.  Actually, the situation sounds extremely dangerous to me.  However, I thought it would be worth mentioning that the budding relationship was *at best* a catastrophe involving an adult emotional (and probably mental) implosion that your friend would have been completely unequipped to deal with."
"You absolutely need to tell your wife, especially since you still interact with Marie on a daily basis and want to maintain a friendship.  In my opinion, I think we should always tell our partners who we slept with and are still friends with."
"This is very, very sad. I'm sorry to hear this. I suspect the mental hold he has on her is extremely, perhaps irrevocably deep-seated. You're unfortunately getting the blame for their abusive relationship. I suggest you try to see if your wife will meet with you at the therapist's office. But I don't think you are in the wrong and should not be trying to make amends with him. You may want to apologize to your wife for escalating the situation but simply explain you couldn't watch him abuse her right in front of you. 

I'm concerned that if she cannot see this situation with clear eyes, and places the blame for this on you rather than on her abuser, you may not stand a chance in this marriage. She should be going low or no contact with her father if, now that she's an adult, he continues to abuse her or attempt to abuse her. But if she won't do that, you cannot have a relationship with him or watch him hurt her - you just can't sit by and observe. If she can't see reason on this, I think you should separate. "
"Have you thought about talking some of this out with a psychotherapist who practices from an anti-racist framework or who otherwise has some knowledge on the subject.

It's a complicated thing (I'm a biracial child who grew up in the US and I've put a lot of thought and research into how to raise a multiracial child in the States in the hopes of doing the best I can with future children). There is a lot of emerging work and research out there on how multiracial children handle developing their racial and ethnic identities and it makes sense to explore some of these ideas alone, with a professional, and with your partner before making any rash decisions. The truth is there are benefits to being biracial in this country and their are significant challenges.  Talk to your partner and explore how you both feel and how you'll handle hypotheticals.  Talk to biracial adults about their experiences. You can't control for everything but you can learn more about this and really explore the nuances."
"In this case, bringing it up twice in a short time period, it means she found someone she wants to fuck.

"If the brother is abusive, this is the LAST thing SIL needs to do. That shit will get her dead at best."
"Okay weird shit. First: run a virus scanner on your laptop and have it checked by a pro for remote access software. Call me paranoid, but the fact that Tom asked you about a warning you never thought you had and then BOOM all of a sudden you've got it, you're laptop is going crazyballs and he buys you a gaming pc? Nah, not buying this coincidence.

I think you're right refusing the 'gift', because I don't think Tom's intentions are friendly. I think he either likes to keep you in a spot where you owe him, or that he secretly crushes on you and is playing the kindergarten game where you bully the girl you likelike. Either way it's bad news and you don't need this, so good on you for shutting this down. That said, shutting it down should have been your boyfriend's job. It's his friend, he gave him the address, he mentioned your laptop broke down. Not only did boyfriend not do this, he also completely overreacted when you asked him to do this.

Note how I'm calling him boyfriend, because I think you should postpone your marriage to this man. Not saying he's a bad guy, but I think you're having some issues lately, among which your current style of arguing. I also don't think he hates life 'because of you', but I think that statement is one to take very seriously.

How long have you been arguing like this, with you crying and him cussing? Try framing it as a percentage of your total relationship. You two live in a temp apartment, have no room, no money, and are about to leave everything behind to move cross-country... Why is this the current situation, and how long has this been going on? Does boyfriend have a job? Does he like his job? Do you have one, and do you like it? How often have you two been gaming lately, and have you seen a significant increase?

To me, it sounds like your boyfriend may feel fucked up in general right now. There certainly are situational factors you mention that could explain a downer period. He might not even be fully aware of it, but if your apartment is cramped, you're all he sees and you're probably always very close, so he might feel the need to 'break out', from you, because you're the physical representation of his feelings of drowning and being trapped. I'm not saying he's depressed, but I think his statement of hating his life is a serious one that deserves more consideration. 

If he is indeed feeling worse lately, try and talk about how it's not okay for him to take that out on you. Try and figure out ways to make this manageable for him. Maybe just acknowledging it is all he needs right now to get some space to breathe again, maybe he wants to talk to someone (therapy). Try and really sit down for this talk. "
"This, so much. Who gives a fuck if he's family? Sexual harassment is sexual harassment and she shouldn't feel any need to protect this asshole, but instead protect others from what he may do if they're not already aware of how he can act."
"The time to talk about opening a relationship is before, not after (and definitely not with an ultimatum) if you want it to work out. Good luck with the hard decisions ahead. It really is better on the other side of a bad relationship.  Promise. "
"Ok, but it sounds like he's ok losing you.  Essentially, it sounds like you're not as important to him, as he is to you.  Am I reading your post correctly?"
"Break up with your girlfriend. Seriously, these are some huge red flags that she’s throwing your way. She’s pushing hard to get rid of someone who has been your main source of emotional support through some really difficult periods of your life and who you have no romantic feelings towards and couldn’t act on them even if you did considering the distance between you. Imagine the fallout if you dared to have a close friend who you actually saw on a regular basis?

The fact that you’re having to sneak around to talk to your BEST FRIEND is a huge problem and it’s going to blow up hugely if your gf ever finds out. The best way to prevent that is to remove the person who’s causing the problem, and that person is not your best friend, OP, it’s your girlfriend."
"Have you talked to him before about this?

""Boyfriend, I am starting to feel really disrespected in our relationship for X, Y, and Z reasons. It feels really shitty when you make fun of a job that is obviously unideal for me but I need for the bills. I do not want you announcing my salary to everyone and it isn't something to make fun of."" See where this conversation takes you. If your boyfriend deflects or tries to make it seem like not a big deal, then he's an ass and you should really take a step back and think about if you want to stay with someone who is so disrespectful to you."
"Thank you for replying. I doubt they were either, but it's like you said, it hit a sore spot. I want to participate and be part of the group, so I'm going to wear the costume. Sometimes it's just hard to tell when everyone is laughing at you or when they are laughing with you"
"Yea because nerdy girls are never late bloomers..


Also, relationships break up. People get other priorities. People move. People maybe start getting into anime, games and cosplay later?


I know enough women who only became gamers later in life.



Also to be honest these events are way skewed towards women in relationships because single girls get ""saught after"" so much at these events. "
"No one here sounds really ready for marriage. All I'm hearing is fairly petty and immature behavior from both parties. 

You haven't exactly been Mr. Dependable here. You've also rattled off a list of *minimal* chores. And it took a long time to commit, in such a way that likely caused some insecurities in your partner. So she may see the ring as a really important sign of commitment. Might be why she's pushing for a larger ""investment"". 

Meanwhile, she decides that the value of her ring is important. Important enough to become an issue. And she's done it tactlessly. 

Does not sound like marriage material. Either of you. "
"31 here, can confirm, way grosser now."
"You’re only 10 months in. It’s time to have a talk with him - physical intimacy is an important part of a relationship for you, and you can’t be with somebody who won’t respect that. Tell him he’s about to earn the new man benefit of being single."
or you'll end up with a case of Munchausen by proxy. 
"&gt; He says that his family thinks of him as less of a man now and probably thinks he's the girl in the relationship.

"You might she's kind of air-headed and dopey like so many of us were as young people? You're dating someone young enough to be your kid, of course you're going to notice shit like this. She's still young, you're at a completely different place in life. 

You really have no business dating her dude. You're way too old for her. Forget all her other problems for a bit, this isn't going to work."
" &gt;I called the police but he wouldn't tell me which freeway he was on so I gave them his vehicle description and where I thought he might be.

Good for you. You obviously know the pain a drunk driver can cause, and I'm happy that you called the police on this piece of shit.

It sounds very much like he was drunk driving AT you, because he knew it would upset you. jackass. "
"That... Sums it up incredibly well. Thank you so much, I will definitely draw inspiration from this when I talk to her. "
She's manipulating you. Just cancel your next appointment and don't make a new one. You don't owe her anything.

"I’m proud of you, OP. Reading through the comments, you really seem to have understood what everyone is saying. A lot of girls your age would be all, “But... but I can’t be MEAN to him!” You, you’re like, “Naw, fuck this guy. I see that I owe him neither coddling, niceness, or anything whatsoever.” Good for you!!!"
"My understanding is that Japanese custody law automatically gives custody to the mother, perhaps that's why she is assuming the American one would do the same. But that is also why OP is in irreversible deep shit if he doesn't get a lawyer asap."
"There are counselors that I can talk to yes, and I've started myself on that path. 

But I appreciate that advice, very much. You're right, I should be careful of the ""I'm sorry but"" because that would normally have gone right past me as a genuine apology. I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but you have a very good point. "
"&gt;""But you can't know that!"" he told me. ""You never know who you'll meet, or what you'll do! There's no way you can promise me that."" 

I wouldn't be able to be with someone who thinks like this.

Cheating on someone is a choice. And not cheating on someone is a choice. A very easy one. Don't f*cking argue with me on this. I wouldn't be able to have a serious relationship with someone with this little self control."

"My best friend and I have an ongoing joke that we basically date each other in man form. Her current boyfriend and I are essentially the same person. There's a reason you and your best friend like each other so much, and it probably overlaps with why you and your boyfriend get along so well. If you trust both of them, trust that there's nothing to worry about. Bringing it up will just inject weirdness into what should be a fun meeting of two people you really care about."
"Yeah. ""Hey sister, my wife is mad that you made her sleep in the living room,"" is VERY different from, ""hey sister, I'm frustrated that you put niece in the third bedroom when you knew wife and I would be coming up to stay that night"""
"I think you should do this over the phone rather than in person. it gives you some safe distance and he's clearly NOT going to stop unless you say something. 

if you don't feel ready to learn the ways of bitchery, you could just block his number. but that kind of just defers the awkwardness if you eventually will have to see him in person.

finally - I can tell you already know this, but your mom sounds like my mom, who thinks that standing up for oneself ""isn't nice"". I love my mom but that's total bullshit. You can be a 100% nice person and still have boundaries. "
"I stalked through your profile since it seems kind of obvious that this isn't a throwaway name.  Are you being honest that this behavior is 'uncharacteristic' of him? 

&gt;We were both drunk. One time we had an argument bc someone stole my phone and my ID (I didn't have any other forms of ID) and I was crying all night and he couldn't stand the crying so he tried to lock himself in the bathroom and sleep in the tub so, still crying, I forced myself into the bathroom and he kept slamming the door, I wound up hurting my elbow and he hurt is toe, although obviously both were by mistake. Wound up calling my mom at 4 AM saying he was going to divorce me, somehow we made up.
I honestly still don't get why he was that mad over me crying. I know it was annoying, but I didn't blame him for anything or say anything hurtful to him. His reaction was as extreme as if I cheated on him. But whatever, he still thinks i was in the wrong for this one

You also mention he has no patience for your anxiety. Look,  I can see all of your defensive,  anxiety laden replies on here and feel this will fall on deaf ears but. . He needs therapy too. You may even want to consider couples' counseling.  Neither of you seem to be coping well or communicating properly."
"Ehhh.  I think this is a little different than just black and white cultural appropriation.

Alice and Nina are likely to be sisters in the very near future, and it's obvious they're already close.  Telling one daughter that she's not allowed to do the things her sister does isn't fair.

More importantly:  He asked Teresa, who thinks it's cute and an adorable idea.  Teresa's the person with the clearest perspective to judge whether this is appropriate or not, and has given Steve the green light.

Now:  I do think he and Teresa should sit down and have a long talk about different cultures and what ""appropriation"" means.  Alice is old enough to start understanding the complicated history of white culture/people appropriating other cultures as some kind of dress-up party.  I also think that Teresa and Nina should take this opportunity to spend the next year really teaching Alice about Mexican culture and history so that she learns this is more than just a big ""princess-party"".

So: I think if it's handled sensitively, with an emphasis on learning about *specifically* Teresa and Nina and their culture and is approached as a ""shared experience between 'sisters'"", it'll be okay.  Steve should let Teresa and Nina be his advisers/guides on what's going to be appropriate."
"I wouldn't do this unless you want to make this more of a drama bomb than it has to be.

No, you don't *have* to justify it to anyone, but unless they're mooches in other areas of your life, it's not worth burning bridges over. It's a netflix account, loads of people share them.

The light and straightforward approach suggested by /u/marriedtosister is a good one. In general you want to be straightforward about why you're doing this(""I can't afford it"") while trying not to make it a jab at them(so leave out anything about how they're the only ones that used it)."
"I would also add that it was a long time ago. Just so they don't worry about any residual feelings or legal mess. 

By the way you're amazing, well done on getting out in one piece &amp; I'm really sorry about your family. It sounds like you have good people around you now. 

Good luck on your date!"
"When I moved to a new town I just rented  a room in someone's house until I was more stable.   It worked out great for me.  You should  get your ducks in a row.  Open a PO Box so you can redirect all your mail and bills there.  Disentangle any bank accounts you may have together.   Then tell him you're sorry, but you've grown into a different person and this isn't the relationship you want.  He will cry and beg, promise to change, maybe blame you.  But, you're not ASKING to break up. You're TELLING him you're breaking up.  There is nothing to discuss and do not change your mind.  Maybe practice saying it in front of a mirror a few times so you say the words out loud.    Good luck!  You have your whole life ahead of you."
"&gt; Just for some perspective - some people react negatively to crying because crying is sometimes used by manipulative people to avoid taking responsibility for their actions.


Sure, there are some people out there who cry crocodile tears to get out of trouble, but I don't think that's anywhere near the most common reason people cry during arguments. I've had ex boyfriends who would accuse me of being ""manipulative"" any time I cried, and I was never trying to get out of trouble in anyway. It didn't matter if they were being the biggest asshole in the world, as soon as I started crying *I* was the bad guy because due to their own emotional hang ups some men see crying as manipulative 100% of the time.  

I think crying being viewed as a manipulation tactic when the vast majority of the time it's a genuine expression of how the person if feeling is a big problem. "
"At this point I don't think there are many rape victims who don't understand that if they go to the police, it could help someone else. 

The thing is, the onus isn't on the victim to potentially hurt themselves even further because of what the rapist may or may not do again. 

Personally, I haven't been raped before. But my best friend was a few weeks ago. We live together. I've basically had to play gatekeeper because everyone wants to tell her what she needs to do about it, and she's just trying to keep her head above water. Does she understand that going to the police *might* prevent it from happening to someone else? Of course. But she also understands that she can only handle so much scrutiny and pain right now. She's barely holding it together and it's been all I can do to pummel into her brain that it's not her fault, nor is it her responsibility to keep a rapist from raping. "

"You should talk to him about splitting the rent based on your respective salaries. That's how a ton of couples with income disparity do it. For example, if you make $15/hour and he makes $10/hour, you'll pay 60% of the rent and he'll pay 40%."

Why, he doesn't care about your birthday or hurting your feelings?

"
You are terribly naive.
"If you do that, does it stop Facebook from notifying you on their birthday? Because I really don't need the reminder that my mom would have been a year older every fucking year. "
"People are underestimating how effective this is. It's really hard to make a teenager do something he or she really didn't want to do. Also, crucially, the daughter isn't responsible for enforcing the custody agreement. Her parents are responsible for complying. There's a difference. "
"I get it. Our friend group used to do several year parties, thanksgiving, solstice, etc. Now it's just a kid party and I'm trying to GTFO as soon as possible. My SO doesn't seem to mind as much but the noises kids make really get to me, like the back of my neck gets tight and I feel like I'm getting an unpleasant adrenaline rush.

Anyhow, the last few years were okay, as babies are pretty chill, little flesh beans that sleep a lot. But now we got like 4 toddlers. Holy hell. Shits insane. This year for our halloween event the two mom's invited their parenting groups. So it's a kids party now, and besides my 2 non kid friends in the group, it's all parents. 

The 3 of us are trying to figure out how to get out of events this year as we met the parent group friends and they are a little (a lot) weird and unfriendly. Apparently people with kids don't like people without... or are suspicious.

It got to the point where I just said, ""Hey __(person putting on event with 2 kids)__, SO and I can't make the party this year. Thanks for much for the invite. Let's get together ___ and I'll bring some goodies for the kids halloween.""

They are so busy no one cares. No one cares. They are way too busy to care. And they know that child free people aren't really into large swaths of kids for holidays. And I'll be reusing that excuse text for thanksgiving, new years, January skiing trip (last two years were nightmares. Fucking horrid), easter, and whatever else. They will, however, be invited to our events or events at bars where I know they can't bring their kids and they will know.

Times change. Their feelings are more robust than you think. They know. It's okay."

"There is also an eating disorder called ARFID that was diagnosed only recently—common in people with autism, OCD, and anxiety. My daughter has two out of three of those, and suffers from ARFID. Basically it’s extremely limited food intake based on aversion to texture, smell, color, brand, or other sensory issues. Take a look at the DSM criteria and see if it sounds like your husband."
My honest thought is that the relationship is over.  There just hasnt been a significant structural event to cause it to end.  Attraction cant be negotiated and if shes not feeling it whats the point.
Absolutely. She clearly needs her license taken away or in the very least driving safety courses.

"This argument is one of the stupidest ones on reddit and I'm so tired of seeing it.  OF COURSE divorce is offered as advice here often.  Most people don't come here because their relationship is great.  They come here when they know everything is FUBAR and they want random stranger to confirm what they already suspect or validate what they're already going to do.  

You don't resort to begging strangers for emotional help when things are just a little bumpy.  People end up here for a reason a lot of the time.  

If you come here and tells us dozens of ways your relationship is toxic, it's pretty logical to offer the idea of not being in that toxic environment as an option.  I think a lot of people come here for some kind of perceived permission to end something they know has been over for a while."

"i agree..This isn't a ""boyfriend"" 

this is your master (32-19 age difference?)

"So one thing that (some!) people don't get when they bring up these subjects is that while it's a chance to have an interesting debate for them, to play devil's advocate, etc., for you it can be part of your lived experience, and a very draining one like that. For instance, if you're talking about the gender pay gap, the way it is often conceptualised (by those who believe in it or not) as something which negatively affects women means that for your boyfriend, it is only relevant to his life when he chooses to have a debate about it. However, for you, it might be something that you are deeply concerned about, are affected by, campaign against- it's a lot more personal because it is a part of your life which you cannot choose to be affected by. This makes rehashing conversations about it more exhausting for you than for him because for him that might be the only time in which he engages with it - and voluntarily so - but for you it might be a day-to-day part of your lived experience which you can't escape and don't want to engage with unnecessarily.


The problem here isn't strictly that he wants to discuss the gender pay gap but the fact that he doesn't respect that you don't want to talk about it! I was having similar problems ""debating"" my bf (I am a woman) about gender issues. It became pretty exhausting for me because I work in an area which deals with gendered issues on a day-to-day basis and it gets tiring having to deal with, and justify the fact I'm trying to deal with, them. So I explained to him that this is something that I encounter too often that it just becomes fatiguing and I'd rather not talk about it in my free time. I don't know if you've tried this already and it might not work, but it might help him understand a little why you're less enthusiastic about the conversation.


Of course, gender dynamics don't have to be something you engage with at work and you shouldn't have to explain your reasons for not engaging any more than you are willing to; this is just a suggestion about how to frame why you might not want to talk about it in a way he might hopefully be sympathetic to. The other thing is that there's a lot of material online where people do engage with the topic if he does want to engage in an argument. He'd benefit from charitably searching for material which argues that it does exist, and how it operates, if he *truly* wants a sincere debate on the subject.


Regardless of all of this, he should really be respecting the fact you've said no and should not violate your boundaries. I do think this is a potential red flag but it might be something that you can bring him round about (if that's what you want to do of course- it's not your responsiblity).


Best of luck!"
"You've left out some key information in your post that can only be found in your comments. 
1) your sister received NO property in the will- it seems pretty reasonable that she would be very upset about this. I'm not sure the value of what you received but if it was significant I can definitely understand why she's upset. You also say you sold it all and didn't share the proceeds- was it in any way sentimental to your sister and would it be reasonable that she'd be upset that you got it all and just sold it if perhaps she would have wanted to hold onto it for sentimental reasons? 

This isn't necessarily relevant to the current situation but there are a lot of people saying she's definitely in the wrong and I really feel like we don't have enough information to make this call. 

2) you sister has a genuine relationship with her niece and sees her at least once a week when you are not present. This is not just her using your daughter as a pawn in your argument- it seems it would definitely be reasonable that she genuinely wants her to be there because of the relationship she has. 

At the end of the day I still wouldn't send my daughter to the wedding if I wasn't present. However I do not think your sister is necessarily as bad as people are making her out to be and I do think she deserves a response. Even if it's just to say you're not comfortable with your daughter being there without you. "
"Stop texting her. You're texting her for purely selfish reasons just to make yourself feel better. You're not a bad person for breaking up with her, but if you keep trying to ""explain yourself' or whatever, then you'll just end up hurting her more for your own benefit."

"&gt; I got frustrated because he was ALWAYS trying to have sex with me and that meant I couldn't be spontaneous or instigate sex as he ALWAYS got there first and if he wasn't trying to instigate sex then he was making sexual innuendo jokes. It was fucking tiresome. It also heaps this constant pressure to perform for you which will lead to him becoming resentful of this constant demand which will lead to him wanting less sex.

Thank you _so_ much for writing this out. I am currently in a similar situation and have been finding it hard to put my feelings into words without making my partner feel attacked on a personal level. I hate that I’ve been conditioned into _knowing_ that a single touch is going to turn into an expectation of sex. And when I’m turned off by that, and I decline, the evening is ruined before I even get the chance to initiate.

"Hey OP, I had an ex who pulled similar shit and breaking up with him is the best decision I’ve ever made in my life. If he honestly thought that getting wasted and driving drunk (KNOWING your brother was killed by a drunk driver even?!) was going to make you say “oh no baby I’m sorry, I’ll rearrange my life for you!” Then he’s completely delusional.

He made the choices that led to him getting fired, not you. He made the choice to act like a child and put his life and job in jeopardy and now he has to face the consequences, one of which is maybe losing his relationship too. 

Drop this waste of space and watch your life get better for it. "
I don't want to ever divorce my husband but I don't know how I can get him to see that limits need to be placed. It hurts. 
"Hey- can't tell if you're serious or no, but I would like to add that casually taking antidepressants to lower your libido is a terrible idea. There are a number of side effects associated with many antidepressants beyond decreased sex drive including serious mood effects. It is an all around terrible idea to mess with the way your brain manages chemicals related to mood without having a serious clinical need.

"You don't have to dramatically cut her out and make a big thing, just distance yourself.  You don't have to answer when she calls, you don't have to go on walks with her all the time, just get a little space at least.  Maybe after the hormones are done her stress over screwing up her body and bank account with 5 kids will calm down and she'll be ready to act like a normal human, and if not, then you can block her completely."
She really does not need to tell them her first-born is his. I don't see what good it could do. Saying she was raped from 13 to 19 by a boy who bore that name and is still very traumatized by it should be more than enough.
"Yeah, seriously. I'm not great at cooking, partly because I never developed the skills and partly because I don't find it to be a particularly great use of my time so I continue to not develop the skills. But I'm still perfectly capable of googling a recipe that meets my dietary needs, tastes, and skill level. I do not understand people with this level of learned helplessness. I understand being bad at being a functional adult, but it should be embarrassing enough to admit that to people that you take basic steps to maintain a basic standard of living."
I'd leave. That level of interest in strip clubs is gross. Do you really want to be with a man who spends time and money on strippers? It's gross and weird.

Men who beat their wives often buy them jewellry too. Abusers dont abuse 100% 
"This. Also, OP, it sounds like you have been putting in a lot of work to fulfill his desires - does he do the same for you? I would encourage you to ask him to try things that you might be a little shy about as well, and this might help him understand your position a bit better."
"I know this isn't exactly the advice you are looking for, but you need to change companies. You've been pigeonholed and your current employer has too many preconceived notions about you. You're almost certainly not be promoted here. You need to get your license and look to make a move if you want to improve your skills and your position. 

I'm sure other people will go over why your actions weren't a good display of leadership, but fundamentally, you should be looking to move one once you graduate. "
"SERIOUSLY. They sound like they need to have their license yanked if they're telling a patient not to seek therapy until they're a danger to someone else, especially a baby."
"The sister sounds petty, I wouldn’t put it past her."
"&gt;they'd wake the baby up

that's a fair point, I didn;t think of that.

I bet if the the sister and husband showed them the size of the bunk bed room, explained the situation and asked *nicely* if they wouldn't mind sleeping in the living room (especially with the dog), then maybe the wife wouldn't be so upset.

But it reads as if the sister just instructed them where to sleep like they were kids and the OP, especially with all the family together, probably defaulted to ""kid brother"" mode and went along with it..."
"OP is so hung up on the possibility of her husband cheating she is neglecting the safety and identity of a baby.. is it even her husbands?? Such a bizarre reaction from OP.

They have nothing going for them.  They have no reason to not give you a reasonable severance, which is why they got personal.  They DO want you to back down.  From here on out, do not meet with them in person without legal counsel.  Leave this to your lawyer -- it's what you're paying him for."
"&gt;maybe she just wanted to have children during her fertile years, man.

While she can't outright blame him *solely*, he *is* a factor in why she currently is not a mother. Her behavior is wrong, but her disappointment and reaction is very natural. "
How the hell does that equate to a woman not shaving her pits?
"This 100%. Dog, then therapy/possibly medication. If you saw such a radical change when you brought home Rex, and she was a responsible pet owner, I can't see why you'd be reluctant to get another dog. You can't force somebody to process their grief. She definitely needs more professional help, but I think dog is the first step towards getting her to a place where she could be receptive to trying therapy again."
"Oh my gosh, thank you. Also, it's not always that easy to ""pump a few bottles"" because of both time and supply."
"What. The. Actual. Fuck?

I cannot believe you are even asking if this is true. First of all: throwing rocks at rabbits is not hunting. Purposely trying to hurt an animal is not hunting. Secondly: Your fiance's views on masculinity are beyond fucked if he thinks intentionally hurting animals is hunting and acceptable for men.

When kids are little (baby/toddler stage), they don't know always know what they're doing is hurting animals (i.e trying to climb on a dog's back or a baby trying to grab a pet's tail) and that's why it's crucial for parents to step in and teach them that those actions are wrong and can lead to animals being hurt. Parents are responsible for teaching their children proper behavior and kindness and that hurting animals is never OK.
 
Your son isn't little. He's 13. He is now a teenager. He knows right from wrong. He knows this isn't hunting. Your son and his friend were throwing rocks at them for amusement. And not only that, but you're brushing off the fact that his sister has come to you saying he has hurt other animals before? You ""weren't totally upset"" because his aim was off **this time?!** Congrats OP. You're going to be the parent of the problem child who denies it. 

There's a reason hurting animals leads to hurting humans. It's not just an implication, there's evidence for it. Your son needs therapy ASAP. You are his mother. Get him therapy and put your foot down on this behavior. Quite frankly your fiance needs help too since his views are being passed on to your son. "
"First, ""the medical field"" is a huge field with many subspecialties, and just because you work in one part doesn't mean you're suddenly experienced in everything. For example I worked with cancer for a while and I have absolutely zero training/experience in dealing with ASD, pediatrics, family medicine, or anything that doesn't involve cancer.

Second, even if he does have experience, that doesn't mean that interacting with your son can be any less uncomfortable or stressful. A lot of things in medicine are just ""shut up and do it"". You'd have a hard time finding people who genuinely enjoy sticking fingers up anuses to get poop out, but it's a routine part of medicine regardless."
"So you have a male cousin, maybe younger maybe more attractive than yourself. This male cousin makes a few passes at your wife and she laughs it off. Later she touches his shoulder or knee ""innocently"" how are you going to feel? You need to see things from your wife's perspective, she's probably very insecure and feels like you WANT her cousin. Reassure your wife not just with words but with actions."
"You need security. 

Best case scenario, your family has enough evidence to get her involuntarily committed so she just can't show up.  And that sounds callous, yeah, *but she needs HELP*. She *NEEDS* full time psychiatric care right now. She is non-functional. *SHE CANNOT HANDLE BASIC TASKS LIKE PACKING OR MAKING A FLIGHT*.  She. Needs. HELP. 

So, anyways, best case scenario is that hse's in inpatient treatment getting the *help she NEEDS*. 

Most likely scenario? She's not. And no matter what you tell her, she might show up. She might not. But guess what? She juts proved herself capable of showing up when she can be bothered. And ruining your time. So you have to assume that she might just fucking show up.

I've heard that off duty police can be gotten for a pretty reasonable cost. If that sounds like a good option, talk to your local police department about hiring them. Show them photos of your sister and make sure they know she is NOT allowed in. Have a *trusted* friend/family member who's assigned to dealing with that drama, so if she does show up *you do not hear about it* on your wedding day and it gets handled without you.

Then enjoy your big day!"

Yeah but your new wife is 10 years younger. There’s a HUGE difference between trying to concieve/having a kid at 28 vs 38. 
"I am carrying my daughter inside of me right now and I have thought so much about raising a daughter in the last months that I think I can share my thoughts here.

I think your husband has no idea what challenges women face in this world and that is a problem. He just sees the often ""easier"" raising of daughters, but doesn't understand that little girls are only easier because good behavior is so much more is expected of them. He doesn't know how it is to be the default blame-taker, to be always expected to be clean, to be sexualized from a very young age and getting told that it's your own fault. He has no idea about the sexual harassment, about being told that something is not ladylike, about all the pressure.
It might be easier to have a girl for him as a parent, especially since he expects girls to be a certain way, it is sure as hell not easier for the kid.

I would have a frank talk with him about it all, about how children become who they are, about what society expects of a child and about what really makes the difference between nice and terrible children. A ""meh"" is not a full answer, when it comes to discussing a future child."
"If you just compare the mortgage payments to rent, you'd think you're saving money.  But there are closing costs associated with both buying and later selling the property, property taxes, mortgage insurance (if you don't put 20% down), condo association fees, homeowners insurance, and the opportunity cost of the down payment (if you didn't spend that money on a down payment, it could be invested and making a profit).  

All of this would add up to be at least the cost of renting if you're only planning on living somewhere for 5 years or less."

"I certainly don't attribute all of our problems to an age gap, but I think it added to our issues.  

He was an incredibly responsible 34 year old - very advanced in his career, a ton of self-discipline. Not that you can't have those things at 34 of course. I think he expected a lot from me. 25 is not a kid by any means, but if I think about myself now at 30, I'm definitely more mature now than I was at 25, and I imagine in 4 years it'll be even more.  

There wasn't a lot of tolerance for making mistakes that don't seem like a big deal to 25-year-olds. In lots of arguments, my opinion was dismissed because he was older and knew better, he paid for all of our trips but then he'd want me to pay for things that most 25yos couldn't afford, etc. There were a few times it felt more like I was dating my dad than a peer, and I'm sure he felt like I was a child more often than anyone I dated close to my age ever did.   

I absolutely think that a ton of age 25/34 relationships work, and wouldn't ever tell someone that age not to date someone that much older/younger, but when I read stories of people like OP, the stories seem to be similar to what I experienced. It would have been *much* worse had I been younger and more impressionable. I think our personalities made the age difference worse. My SO now is 31, and it's unbelievably refreshing to be with someone at the same life stage. "
"It is not accurate enough, since douchebag was staying in our city."
"First off, this is normal. Studies show the most stressful part of your life is right now, where you're a provider and have young children. And one of the normal ways to cope with stress is to fantasize about grass-is-greener situations.

If you were in that grass-is-greener situation, in an apartment all alone, you'd probably be stressed out about feeling lonely and not having anybody to share your life with and obsessing about that. :)

&gt;I feel as if I don't live for myself at all 

And it sounds as if that is true right now. So here's what you need to do: carve out time to live for yourself. 

Your child is not going to benefit from having a parent who is not fully self-realized and who is unhappy. It's much better to model somebody who practices self-care and has interests and hobbies.

Start with once a week. Figure out one evening a week that you can go off and do...whatever it is you want to do. Sit in a library and be silent and read. Go play board games. Go develop a hobby and an identity outside of your family.

Allow your wife the same luxury. I guarantee that she has similar feelings.

Then also make time for a date night so that your marriage has an identity outside of being parents as well.

You can't afford a babysitter? Develop relationships with other local parents that are willing to trade off with you. You watch their kid once a week and they'll do the same for you. Believe me, LOTS of parents are looking for an arrangement like this.

This is a solvable problem. But it requires you to put in some effort to prioritize *yourself*."
"Run away as fast as you can. If he won’t even admit to lying when confronted with evidence, then you cannot and should not trust him in any significant way. "
"Why are you so obsessed with money and appearances, and why do you think you should have some kind of sway here? You don't get a say, period. You just get used to it. "
Please disregard anyone telling you to wear jewelry to work to coddle and enable your wife's exceptionally uncompromising insecurity. She is 100% wrongheaded about this and you shouldn't be trying to find a way to wear a ring to appease her.
"Yeah I read enough r/relationship to now that DTMF is a common advice, sometimes abused, but other times really needed, so sometimes you don't want to be the one to say it. In this case, honestly, unless he's extremely apologetic and prepared for a lot of couple's therapy (and even then...), it's definitely a DTMF case. As you said, he's a fucking asshole."
"&gt; I don't see why the son should be required to do so. That's ridiculous.

That's not an uncommon or unreasonable thing to ask in a relationship. Past history is important to a lot of people and a lot of people will be curious, if nothing else."
"This is an understandable way to think, but it doesn't reflect reality. 

Think about it this way - if you'd suddenly felt that she wasn't enough for you, what would you have done? I bet the answer isn't ""fuck around on her for a year"". 

The reasons why people do these things are complicated, but generally not about their partner - I think it can be about thrill seeking, about missing that ""butterflies"" feeling. It can be about something missing in the cheater themselves. It isn't about their partner. "
"That sister (and yes, I suppose legally she is a sister of sorts) is merely the child of a scumbag and the woman he fucked. That sister has NO MEANINGFUL CONNECTION with OP. Just a little DNA from a common sperm donor, that's all. No shared culture, no shared history, no shared anything. 

I don't think you should guilt OP about not wanting a ""relationship"" that does not exist.

"&gt; My anxiety, my infertility and lack of children, my lack of having my own land to put my house on without living on family land, my lack of driving, my skin condition, and body pain.

Whoa dude. This isn't about the car, it's more about not having choices and autonomy in your life. The car is just something tangible to point to because your opinion wasn't taken in to consideration.

If we heard this from your husband's perspective, what would he say? "
"I don't see what the toys have anything to do with the situation or the fact she didn't tell you about them....I mean she didn't have to tell you about them. A woman can have toys and like to use them alone. That's really not something she owes you to use with you just because she owns them. 

However, if she can't even talk about sex and you two aren't really having much, that's a huge issue. Open communication about preferences, fantasies are all an important part of a relationship. I'd suggest sitting her down and explaining all the feelings you are having about your sex life and your dissatisfaction with the level of communication. "
"While true, the OP mentions they had difficulty conceiving and don't want to take any risks. I think it's reasonable to be wary of a 3 week long trip in a foreign country at 5 months pregnant - I wouldn't take that risk, myself. "
"I'm a guy. I had way to much respect for my girlfriend (now my wife) to go anywhere near a party like that. Unfortunately, the change in his behavior should come from him, you telling him he can't go would not work out well. 

I could see this being a deal breaker. Not just that he attends, but that he thinks you should accept it. "
"If he was though, surely he wouldn't be dumb enough to do it in front of his girlfriend,the woman's boyfriend and all their coworkers?"
"Speaking from experience, there is nothing worse than telling your partner NO, and then having them constantly touch you or hint towards sex. Begging and pawing for sex is the most unsexy thing ever. I fucking hate it, and it makes me feel violated. Because I've had sexual assault in the past, it makes it even worse. Pack up and leave, or work on the issue, but pushing yourself on to the person you apparently love is a sure ticket to make them resent you.

This post touched a nerve with me, so I'm sorry for my harsh tone. But this is probably how he feels too."
"It sounds like you are helping a lot but she is feeling overwhelmed.  Try to get him on bottles so you can take night feedings on weekends.  When he wakes up on weeknights, go get him and deliver him to your wife in bed to fees, then you diaper and return him to bed.  Look in to getting a house cleaner in a couple times a month for the big cleaning.  It should cost too much and will relieve a lot of burden from your wife.

Do you take him out on weekends for an hour or two, so your wife can have alone time, sleep, or go out with a friend?  Do you guys have family time whenever possible?"
"That's awesome, most doctors end up refusing people until they are in their 30's, if not later.

She clearly is trying to get you to move out and doesn’t care how you feel
"Of course it's both. The boys in our class lived in the same society we did - they weren't the first to introduce us to the notion that skinny girls with straight blonde hair and no leg hair were attractive, but they most definitely reaffirmed it by asking such girls to ""be their girlfriend"" and telling people they ""liked"" them much, much more frequently that the other girls."
"I can understand that mentally speaking he is at the level of the newborn and therefore the mother/son relationship remains at that level too.

On a nutritional level there is no reason that your son needs this. He is not a growing baby. I think your biggest concern should be that he will be going through puberty soon (if he hasn't already) and that there is potential for him to act out in inappropriate ways as a result of this that could be upsetting to both him and your wife. This is compounded by the fact that the doctor has told you that he could possibly develop his mental capabilities as time goes on - the breastfeeding could become very confusing for him. 

I think your wife is the main person benefiting from it. She is getting the intimate connection with her son that perhaps she's never had before. But I think you should talk to her about this and nip it in the bud now before it causes issues down the line. "
This is the most realistic advice one I've read

"With your edited update that it was HIS birthday dinner, this gets weirder. 

It's not *as* weird if he went to a dinner without you with other couples. A little strange, but ok. 

But why wouldn't he want you to be there for a birthday celebration of his? That's weird. The couples dinner that you keep mentioning is not the weird part. "
"This is all kinds of messed up. 10 jobs in 3 years?! Does your wife have any goals at all as a professional? 

I know tracking sounds super shitty, but, honestly, there are clearly communication issues and she lies to you. I would track her. Find out where she's going everyday. See what she's up to for a week and look at the info.

And if you guys are that financially strained, she cannot be quitting and getting fired. She needs to maintain employment and you need to stress that the burden of supporting her financially is doing damage to your relationship. 

Once you find out where she is, you'll have a better idea as to how you can approach it. If it's harmless stuff, like going to shops or seeing girlfriends or whatever, that's one thing. If she's spending the day at someone's house all day, that's a major concern. 

And if she's deliberately screwing you both financially, you need to start keeping track right now and when you call her on it, you need to pull all accessible funds from your accounts, immediately, if she has joint access."
"I second this. The emotional labor thing is huge. Offer to stock diapers/wipes/vitamin D/medicines/how she likes the diaper bag to be packed. Consider what toys your baby might like (like a scooter in the future, and research the helmets, etc.), the books you might like to read him. If your baby is having trouble with teething, sleeping, crawling, or whatever, research the problem to troubleshoot what to do about it. My husband would just watch TV with our son all the time. He also looked to me as though I was the boss of our son, and I was annoyed because it was my first time being a parent, too! I get it, he was tired, but I was too, and I felt like I had to do everything for our son because my husband didn't take the initiative. While I am also in school. That's great that you cook dinner and clean up. My husband never cooks or cleans (and leaves his dishes/food out), and it's very tiring. So big kudos to you."
Absolutely a dealbreaker. What if we had a daughter?
"Absolutely do not get him the toy he whined about. Tell your husband to make his mother put a sock in it or else you will.

 But maybe do something else nice for him if he is feeling grouchy about his hand - favorite dinner, treat, extra bedtime story, whatever his thing is.. There's nothing wrong with a bit of TLC when a child is sad/sick/injured as long as you're not rewarding the negative behavior. That way you not only get your MiL out of your hair, you show her what good Attention (as opposed to bad Attention) looks like."
"I’ve told that to her in the past. It’s the shelter’s job to decide if a person is good enough to adopt someone. We just have to help them find people interested in a cat, which is difficult especially one with stomach issues. She thinks if we share a Facebook post with them for them to share then he’ll find a home that way. But they’re so busy with other animals in the shelter. And I doubt someone on Facebook will be interested in a cat with a listed stomach problem."
"No, the ceremony is the most important part. The reception is the most *fun* part, but the ceremony is the most important. "
Please get away from this situation and go get yourself tested. 
"This sounds like a very reasonable thing to do! No point in being shitty just because someone else is, take the moral high ground! :)  
Also, OP, some people are just cunts, don't let that influence you, how you're communicating is perfectly valid and clever and I think this thread alone shows more than enough how most sane people feel about this! Don't worry about someone's shitty reaction, if that's the only way this pathetic person can validate themselves or get attention that's their problem ultimately..."
"It sounds like your parents responded in the right way. He’s being an ass and he needs to grow up. Posting on Facebook is beyond inappropriate, and I would block him right now if I were you. Also, talk to your parents about what he’s posting online. It’s inappropriate on many levels, including the fact that Facebook is public and you and your younger brother are both minors. I would assume that most people would have the same reaction your parents did (seriously, grow up, 20M), so I wouldn’t sweat that too much, but do talk to your parents about how much this is bothering you. If he brings it up when you’re around, ignore him, as hard as that is. He wants to get a rise out of you because he’s an immature asshole, but hopefully ignoring him and discussing your concerns with your parents will help."
I'm confused does he wear dirty clothes? Stop. Just stop doing his laundry.

Apart from that, your friendship with Andrea. If you're still ignoring her at the moment, it's time to stop with that. Because it sounds like she's a friend you definitely don't want to lose, which is exactly where you're headed right now"
"Let her go. She's made the problem out of it for herself. Continue to be true to yourself, and find someone that can accept you as you are. Giving an ultimatum over your personal diet is ridiculous. Bye Felicia"
"Your life choices are not your mother's failt.  At 27, you would have been old enough to research where there law school would be a wise investment.

"OP, it's been THREE YEARS and you were 25 when you met. Your BF is nuts."
"Uhm...You're dad wouldn't need a condom at a strip club. Since you found the wrapper in the car, it's likely he has met up with prostitutes/strangers, as I doubt a ~60-year-old man would normally have sex in a car unless he A) didn't have a regular mistress with her own place where they could have sex and B) couldn't get a hotel room without his wife noticing the charge or cash withdrawal from their joint account.

Here's the thing, if your dad is doing the nasty with prostitutes (or really anyone for that matter), he's putting your mom's health at risk, assuming *they* still have sex together. I get that you don't seem very keen on getting involved because their relationship seems doomed regardless of what you do or don't say, but imagine you were in your mom's position and someone was withholding information that could impact your health."

"This was my immediate thought too. My friend's ex-husband did this at the start, every time she was due to leave to house to hang out with me or other friends or her family, about 5 minutes before he walked out the door he was suddenly 'intensely nauseous' or had a 'sudden onset migraine' or 'severe panic attack'. He was, in the end, a horrific physically and mentally abusive asshole who did things like lock her alone in her home for a weekend while taking all her electronics/communication methods away, and buying a present on their honeymoon for his affair partner."
"If he had come to you and said: ""this change in you is making me anxious. Can we come up with things we can do together to make me feel safer and you can still have fun"" then yeah, you could work with him. 

But he hasn't done that. He's been verbally abusive, and even when you've given him what he wants, he's told you he doesn't trust you to keep to your word. 

It's also worth noting - he thinks that if you have the opportunity to cheat, you will. That doesn't tell us anything about you, but it does tell us something about how he behaves. "

What else do I know?  He's completely aware he thrashes and talks in his sleep.  He's always known.  People have razzed him about it since was a kid.

Something here isn't right... I think you're being manipulated, OP.

"My husband has several close friends that are women. They have all gone out of their way to get to know me and have also become my friends. They are now “close” with both of us. If I read this right, you are his sister’s friend, who has been showing her husband more attention than you’ve shown her. I see why she maybe felt disrespected and sees your behavior as inappropriate and rude. She definitely didn’t need to embarrass you but add in the recent new baby  hormones I can understand why she lashed out. If you’re close with a married man it’s important to be close with who he’s married too. It’s kind of an unspoken rule, especially if you’re close to the family. "
This guy is a loser. Read OP's comment history. She totally buried the lede.
Oh come off it. If you think you can have a normal family with this man then forget it.
"OP doesn’t even need to go into full details if she doesn’t want to. “When I was a kid, a boy/man with that name treated me horribly. I still correlate NAME with him and his abuse, so that’s why I reacted poorly at first. I’m sorry about that, and I hope we can move past this.”"
Hahahahahaha is this real 
"He just broke up with a long term partner and started seeing you not long after that, making it clear he wanted things to be casual. 

It seems like you two want different things. "
"As a former 18 year old that dated a 28 year old, can confirm that abuse, cheating, and being taken advantage of was the norm (and I didn't know any better). I learned a hard lesson. Now that I'm in my 30s, I try to imagine dating someone fresh out of high school and it boggles my mind."
"Well, it wasn't just one thought, it was a few, and I'm not sure why you would think your 'observation' would discount the comment in any way.

The rest of your post is simply repulsive."
"You said you live there right? You also said you trust your bf. It seems to me like this is your insecurity and not really him being crazy. That being said if this is really something you can't put up with for a week then you have no choice but to stick to your position. Just remember that this could create problems within the relationship, possible resentments for your lack of understanding. I'd suggest really thinking through why you don't want your bf to help out his friend."
"As someone who also grew up poor, I [38m] don't think you'll ever respect him as a man.  I've dated girls who were the same way, and they don't change.. at least not before they're 35 or so.

He refuses to communicate about it because he knows you're right, and he doesn't want to deal with the fact that he hasn't grown up yet."
"Honestly I feel like OP still feels something more than platonic love, and he's taking advantage of that (knowingly or unknowingly). 


Being casual about really serious stuff is how friendships get destroyed. Think of all the stories of people who consign on a car or a student loan and then break up or the recipient stops paying, then multiply that horror by 1000 times. "
"The problem is you have no control over your own life. You are depending on your husband for everything. I think the car thing drove this point home to you, and brought your justifiable anxiety about this to the surface. "
"The fact that you aren't able to be happy for your friends, and only care about yourself is pretty concerning. "
Please don't show him this thread. 
"He feels guilty so he texts his fiancée to get her to bail too? Sorry, not buying it. 

Jesus people on this sub will bend over backwards to defend shitty behavior in the name of mental illness. You know what this also is? Textbook abuser manipulation - isolating her from family and friends. I agree that OP needs to approach this with a soft touch but there’s no reason to attempt to justify his shitty behavior."
"That's all well and good, but I think you're missing the idea that apparently your boyfriend feels like *you* are the woman in the relationship, because you take on most of the traditionally female roles. Except that he apparently sees your role as lesser than his, as somehow shameful and unworthy. Otherwise, he wouldn't have reacted so strongly to the prospect of his own family seeing him that way.

That's a big problem, OP. I'm not sure your boyfriend 100% respects you. He comes across as somewhat sexist *and* homophobic. "
Dude...learn to cook from your grandma while you are visiting. You in 5 years will be so happy you did. 
"If my husband ever behaved the way your boyfriend did, I would leave.  I would never be with someone that would treat me so bad as to gang up with his mother to scream at me."
Are you ready to deal with her crying about everything....all the time?
"She likes it? She's going to be spending years and tens of thousands on her education. It's ridiculous to think that making her spend those resources on something she doesn't want to spend them on is at all a fair compromise. 

Furthermore, about all your qualms with the degree:

1. She's not going to have to pay a lot for engineering textbooks. I still have ebook copies of every math and engineering textbook from all my classes, along with several from classes I never took. Ask any upper div student and they'll show her how to get her hands on them. Furthermore, a lot of upper divs use books from long ago that are still relevant. Ask anyone that took a compilers class about their Dragon Book. It's the standard compilers textbook and you can get it for less than $5 because it's from the 80s. If you're paying hundreds for a computer science textbook, then you're doing it wrong.

2. People change careers all the time. I've seen studies cite that people change careers 3-7 times throughout their lifetime. Just because she chose a certain path early on in her life doesn't mean she's enslaved to it until the day she retires.

3. You can be a programmer and work from home. Freelance and remote jobs are a thing. I currently do a lot of my work out of coffee shops.

4. CS still offers financial stability. Even if it pays less than her current job, you'd need a serious spending issue if you go broke on a software dev salary. Beyond that, just because it pays less than her job now doesn't mean that she'd be happier in her current job over software dev.

5. When is timing good? When your kids are in elementary school and you want to enroll them in after school activities? In high school and taking AP classes while doing sports? When your kids are in college and you're both in your 50s? 

6. Why does she have to give up a career she'd like but you don't? Your post drips with selfishness. Everywhere in there is ""I don't want to have a nanny, but I also don't want to give up my career aspirations so she should."" "
"Ask for the studies in question,potentially after class or in an email.

There isnt a reason to escalate an in the moment dispute. Its easy to fall into the mentality of defensing your experience,but a) its extremely difficult to win a debate in conversation because you dont have access to sources at your finger tips and b) even if you ""win"",theres nothing to be won.

It can be really unsatisfying to not get the last word,but if youve made your point,at some point you ""agree to disagree"" so the lesson can move on"
"Another silver lining, though a bittersweet one, is that the cats are in a good home. It's not like OP had to drop them off at a shelter, or give them to a family she doesn't know. They are being cared for by someone who really wanted them.

OP, I know you're miserable, but take some comfort in the fact that your cats are not. They are happy. 

Take a little bit of time to yourself to grieve for the relationship, then go find a new furry companion to love. "
Sounds like he just wants to he dominant in all aspects if his life including your relationship. Mug him off and then find a new job. 
Just gonna skip over the violence?
This really scares me. I am nowhere near OPs husbands level but 90% of the time I eat the same 4-5 items/ meals. I rarely eat much outside those items and sometimes I can’t figure out why. I’m scared that I have this and I don’t know what to do. What is the line? I’m sure many people eat the same meals on rotation but is 4-5 enough for variety 
"It's interesting, I had jaw surgery done about 5-6 years or so ago too. Both upper and lower, and had some nose stuff done at the same time. All for health reasons, not cosmetic. MOST people noticed a change in my appearance after I recovered, but I really never did. 

If I'm totally honest, the recovery process was very difficult and miserable (got food poisoning shortly after surgery, it was a bad time), but I'm glad I did it, and would probably do it again knowing what I know now. "
"He sounds like this job is perfect for him. Personally, the thought of him cradling a baby is very sweet. I know that if my baby was sent to the morgue, I'd hope their body was treated in such a respectful and loving manner. "

"Ok I don't normally condone subtweeting in any form, but there is something hilariously innocent about calling your ""friend"" a Hufflepuff as an innocent after she ran off with your husband"
I have friends that hire a babysitter for their 5 kids when they host game nights. I have never seen the kids around during game nights. It's definitely possible for this to work. 
Haha! That's basically how my fiancé proposed. Except replace waffles with a cheese platter. 
"Right, because he'd behaved so maturely up until that point..."
"&gt; Talk to your wife. Move out. Talk to a divorce lawyer. 

But not in that order. Lawyer first. Then, depending on what the lawyer advises, either move out first or talk first."
"This is the only explanation I can fathom for this kind of behavior -- that there's something going on between mom and dad that OP doesn't know about. Unless mom has always been a little cray and OP isn't mentioning it. Regardless, even if there's a history of dead bedroom, cheating, questionable texts, etc., mom needs to figure out a way to keep it from becoming her child's problem. 

Having mom meet this woman could be helpful -- to develop trust -- or at least having her handle all of the transport for OP. "
"Sure, and it isn't about that he went to a hooker. It is between OP and her husband, sething he shouldn't have done without consulting her.

Her adult son can br old enough to take a loan from his parents, but OP's husband should consult her about it before providing said loan."
"It isn't your fault. She cheated because of her own issues. If she had a problem with your relationship, she had the chance a year ago to be an adult and tell you. The cheating is all on her. It hurts, I know because I have been there, but cut her out like a cancerous tumor so you can be healthy again."
"Right. That was what I meant. It's framed in movies as this wonderful quirkiness that brings wonder back into the lives of men, when really what it is in real life is pretty awful. Turns out there's no MPDG, just foolish, selfish, responsibility avoiding women ok with stringing someone along until they're sick of them. "
"Your boyfriend is insane. This is not a healthy relationship. You are not in the wrong.

It's commonly said here that the reason someone over thirty would date someone who's barely 20 is because women his age don't put up with his shit.

Your boyfriend's tirades are emotionally abusive. He's trying to make you responsible for his own oppressive, unhealthy clinginess. His demand for attention is controlling.

You are not a bad person. Please reevaluate this relationship. Sending you flowers does not make up for trying to tear you down for not being at his beck and call a few nights a week."
"Some men genuinely have no respect for women. I knew a guy who decided to dump his girlfriend, and the day of she called and asked about getting a tattoo of his stage name. He told her to do it, and then broke up with her afterwards ""because it would be a funny story"". "
"Why didn’t you sleep the next get before? If you just had insomnia it is different than if you were out with friends or playing video games all night. 

There probably isn’t a parent of a young child who hasn’t dozed off while watching the child, especially if the kid is doing something quiet. But you fell so deeply asleep that your son couldn’t wake you up. That is a major fuck up. Your wife is right to be angry. You need to take affirmative steps to make sure that you are able to remain conscious while watching your kid. "
"Good point. Some people accept external ""family"" at different times for different reasons. It's good to respect their boundaries (not implying you are not). And hopefully they will respect yours. "
"Let me make sure I have the timeline right:

* Early morning: friend says she's going to sneak out to meet her predator.  You decide you have to report this to the guidance counselor (side note: GOOD FOR YOU.  You know this already, it seems, but I know hearing it can sometimes help.)
* 2nd class period: you meet your guidance counselor and explain the situation.  Guidance counselor calls in friend immediately after your one-on-one talk to discuss it with the both of you, you leave early.
* 2nd class period through lunch: friend sends repeated cruel and biting texts about how you ruined her life.
* Lunch: you see your friend's Snapchat history, stating her intent to beat you to a pulp if she sees you.
* Mid-afternoon-ish: you see your friend.  She texts you that she is sorry for what she said and that she had been angry.

If the above is correct, this entire trajectory is actually to be expected from a preyed-upon minor whose predator was reported, and it's actually quite possible that she truly regrets her earlier outburst and wants to apologize sincerely.  Realizing you've been abused and manipulated is a rude and EXTREMELY uncomfortable awakening (remember: he manipulated her into believing that he was trustworthy; it's *hard* to break out of that programming), and lashing out seems to be the instinctive reaction to that kind of situation even if you realize seconds later that was a bad idea.

I recommend sleeping on the problem and letting her approach you tomorrow about it.  If she repeats the fact that she's sorry she did that, I would recommend giving her another chance.  She's going to go through a lot to recover from this, and supportive friends will mean the world to her."

"The fact that you see literally any mention of race issues as “polarizing” and “controversial “ makes me wonder if you’re projecting insecurity on this situation. TBH you don’t sound like a bigot, and it doesn’t sound like he has explicitly called you that, but you do sound obnoxiously color blind and insensitive.

Now, whether heavy topics are ok in a non-human services related workplace... ehh that could be up for debate.

But maybe try chilling out and doing your own thing. Those things he brings up aren’t really political, they’re issues that objectively affect a lot of people, but I get how you might not feel comfortable chiming in. Relax. Don’t be so defensive and he will probably pick up on that."

"This right here OP.  I know a woman who is desperate for a family in her 30s, and she will tell anyone without hesitation that when she finds 'the one' she is going to quit her job and be a homemaker.  There is nothing wrong with being a homemaker, but most men get scared off when a woman announces on the first date that she wants to be financially dependent on them, and has no career aspirations.

A bit of therapy might show OP if she is messing up something fundamental like this, and maybe help her get out of the sad/hopeless headspace she has landed in."
"I mean...to be fair, if a straight guy on here claimed he slept in the same bed with his female BFF while in a relationship I think a lot of people would call bullshit and accuse him of cheating. That said, that imaginary scenario is not at all the same as OPs, and the boyfriend is being a COLOSSAL douchebag. I think OP should tell him where to stick something uncomfortable and leave him."
"I know I'm ridiculously late to this thread, but I just wanted to bounce some ideas off you. To me, it sounds like this merperson has life figured out. She's got money, she's found something she loves doing (water things), and seems like all-around ok person. It's just weird to hear that an apparently content individual can be written off just because she isn't trying to become the fastest rat in the race."
"That's the language of someone who's not happy but just comfortable in a relationship. You should be talking about whether you're happy or not in your relationship. When you start comparing it to others like that, it's likely because you aren't happy but think it would be worse to go elsewhere."
"&gt; If it were me I would end the relationship. However I'm also not a mother so can't imagine how hard it would be to do that right now

I get that a lot of women, especially women with new babies, think this.  But the fact is, it wouldn't be any harder for OP than it is right now, and probably easier.  The guy is literally doing nothing to help with the baby, is not present at all as a partner, and is obviously causing OP great stress with how much of an asshole he's being.  Ditching him would probably make life quite a bit easier."

"I appreciate the insight. I think I'll mention my concerns to my mom, even if things may not go in my favor. I'm not exactly interested in getting a part-time job as others have mentioned. I don't qualify for work-study/most campus jobs due to my mom's finances. However, I'll look into getting an internship in summer 2018 to pay for a cheap room near campus.

Worst case, I deal with one bad semester or move out whenever my sister moves in."

That first paragraph.. wow. That's some hard truth summed up nicely. I would encourage OP to use similar wording.

"I’m usually the first to speak up about age gap relationships and how they’re almost always unhealthy with a bad power dynamic. But I also want to point out that of course we see age gap problems on here because that’s what /r/relationships is all about! We don’t get to see any of the rare examples of healthy age gap relationships because they’re not having problems and posting on this subreddit. But if you’ve got an age gap *and* a problem that you want advice on, it’s pretty bloody likely that they’re related issues. "
"Yes, you eventually do get over it. However the depth and length of the relationship, as well as the cause for your split, will play a role in getting over it. You're in a state of grief at the moment, so allow it to go through the motions. Take this time to self improve on yourself and use that grief as motivation. Hit the gym, get some new clothes, read some self improvement literature, etc. Having some drinks is ok, but don't allow alcohol to become an emotional crutch.


As for her harassing you, merely block her. If she finds other means, clearly and concisely tell her to stop contacting you and block her again. Document it all (screenshots, for example). If it continues, go to the police department and show them the evidence and that you want to file charges or get a restraining order (if possible)."

I mean...exactly.  Maybe you aren't as affectionate with your current bf, but you admit that your current guy is your ""great love"".  This isn't the case for OP. It seems to me that OP's wife has kind of admit that the last guy was *the love of her life* and not OP and that's different.  She also implied that there is a part of her that will always love him.  Wtf??  At one point I had gotten comfortable with the idea of marrying the last guy I dated before my current bf...but alas we broke up and I got over it in a healthy way and I can confirm there is no part of me that still loves him...because I love my current bf with my whole heart."
"In a lecture setting, professors normally want to move the conversation forward.  Raising your hand and saying 'Me, too"" is not adding to the discussion and the professor was trying to elicit a further response.

Reading your response below about her question on murdering, etc., that is absolutely way over the line for any teacher - at best tactless, at worst callous.  Your friend's best bet is to talk to her in private during office hours and say that it crossed a line, remind her that he has PTSD, and (if he wants) talk to her about his experiences so she has a better understanding of what he went through.  (He doesn't have to mention specifically what he did, but maybe how many tours he did, where he was stationed, what he saw to give her a better idea of what he experienced.)  If she still continues to be hostile or dismissive towards him, then go to the dean of students.

It might be hard for him to talk and she might be clumsily trying to encourage him because the perspective of veterans can be very valuable.  Building a personal relationship between them outside of the classroom setting would help tremendously managing discussions during class.  "

"You're not going to get much sympathy from this subreddit.  You're going to get a lot of ""just because your husband cheated doesn't mean you cheating is the right thing to do, blah blah"".  But to answer your question,

1) you need to tell him asap.  The longer you wait, the harder this conversation will be and the more hurt/angry your boyfriend will be when the conversation actually happens, 

2) how you tell him doesn't really matter.  He won't take it well, no matter how much you try to sugar coat it.  Just go ahead and tell him.  Be sincere.  Be honest.  Be completely open and answer his questions patiently.  Don't be defensive - you may have been the victim in your marriage when your husband cheated, but in your relationship with your boyfriend, he is the victim,

and more importantly,

3) tell him what your plans are (leaving your husband?  If so, when?  Or not planning on divorcing him at all?) and respect his decision to walk away if he chooses to do so."

"I'm on your side here. They probably weren't lying. However to not even think to send a simple text apologising is incredibly rude. At the very least, because you probably wouldn't have looked at your phone on the day they should have text or called the day after to apologise. It is so so rude to just not show up and hope nobody noticed.

EDIT: to add to that, i'm not suggesting you hold a huge grudge against them forever. However it would be acceptable to talk to them about it i feel. Just say that it's ok that he was sick and you understand but it would have been nice to have heard from them before you had to reach out 5 days later."
"Just... get over it.

If people “snigger” at you, so what? They’re not the ones who get to take her home at the end of the night. A lot of the looks/laughter you’d get when out and about with a taller woman are jealousy. Not jealous because they wish they were short, but jealous because you’ve got some banging chick *in spite of it*.

If she doesn’t care then being insecure about it will just be a huge turn off.

Normally I'd agree, but...she did lie. just not in the way you said. And as horrible as it is, people do lie about this thing.Not often, but it does happen.

"As a concerned neighbor, ""I dumped him, its over"" is what I would most want to hear, despite you being embarrassed that you blurted it out.

"So when you say your family expects you to repair the relationship they... What, expect you to somehow make your sister act like she is ok with it?

"&gt;Is he going to avoid his co-worker? Change jobs if she is a problem?

All other issues aside, I just wanted to focus in on the fact that he cheated with a coworker. What's been going on between the two of them that the first time they have some drinks, they're fucking around in a bedroom? That's quite the escalation without there having been some emotional cheating in the in-between... Never mind how risky it is to join a group of *co-workers* at an after party and engage in such behavior. I would be surprised if it doesn't circulate around the office how awful these two people are. So embarrassing for everyone involved."
"It doesn't matter if he's grieving. That is no excuse for emotional abuse. He is being abusive to both you and your daughter, and especially for your daughter that will have long-term psychological consequences for her.

Your best bet right now is to pack a bag for you and your child and to go stay with your parents or somebody else for a while. Stop trying to be understanding. Abuse is not acceptable and you should not subjected to it.

Tell him that you will not return until he has signed up for a grief counselor and makes a commitment to stop the abuse. Period.

I realize this seems hardcore given that he just lost his father, but grief is not an excuse for behavior like this and you should not tolerate it for one second. "

"I understand it's his mom. He needs to understand that his mom and sister have to take some responsibility for their lives. I think it would be beneficial to sit down and discuss a hard limit to the amount of money per month you can give to them. Find a decent compromise. Then start working on how to reduce your costs to meet that budget. (What's in that storage unit? Can it's contents be sold? If so, do it and rid yourself of the bill. Is it junk? Toss it and rid yourself of the bill. Whatever electronics they currently have will not be replaced by you any longer. They can work to save up for a new phone, laptop, etc. It might take years, but welcome to fucking life.) 

There just HAS to be some compromise between you and your husband. I don't know how to get him there, but set yourself up to be in an environment that will help you not argue about it. Bring a detailed budget with all of your expenses, all the regular monthly expenses for his family, and then any savings plans or whatever else money is spent on each month. Add the amount of money that has been spent on them for extra stuff (furniture, new phones, loans) spent on his family. Let him see those totals, where you are spending your money each month, and how much of it is going to his family. (In addition to dollar amounts, a breakdown with percentages would work really well here to illustrate where money is going.) Explain that you understand he wants to help his family, but there has to be practical limit because you're not wealthy and not able to support his sister, her children, and his mom. If he refuses to set a monetary limit and compromise with you on what you're paying for them, then suggest adjusting what you guys spend money on for yourselves. For instance, cut out cable, trade in a car with a high payment and get something cheaper, reduce your cell phone plan, etc. (I have no clue what you spend money on, obviously.) Not that I think you should cut what you're spending on yourselves, but that this part of the discussion might help him come to the realization that your budget in GENERAL needs to be reduced period. That can happen one of two ways. I would hope he would put the limit on his family and not you guys.

"How's *your* relationship with the kids? If you're working the same amount of hours, and seeing them as little as your wife is, are the little ones ditching you for Macy as well?

If they're not, if they're still excited to spend the odd hour with daddy, that may be why your wife is dragging her feet on cutting back her work time. If you're keeping up a good relationship with the kids despite minimal contact, part of her may be thinking ""It works for him, why isn't it working for me, it's clearly not the hours."" Do you and your wife do different things with the kids when you're with them, maybe? If so try switching it around every so often - say, if you usually do baths and she does bedtime stories, let her squirt them with water for a bit while you do the funny voices of Spot the Dog or whatever the hell picture books kids have nowadays. 

If, on the other hand, the kids are as indifferent to dad as they are to mum, well, no wonder they're so attached to the nanny, she can hardly be surprised! In that case, though, the two of you have to take into account that Macy is on a two year contract only, and that eventually she'll leave. Maybe that will allow your wife (and you, to be honest) more of the kids' affection, but you have to be realistic as parents. If it weren't Macy - if it were Sally or David who were the nanny - the kids would still love them more, because they're the ones who would be *there*. If parents are more interested in career than kids, the kids are going to pick up on that - and that's something that will apply to both of you, though clearly your wife is feeling the truth of that more right now.

I mean, you've got a deadline here. In two years, when Macy leaves, are the two of you planning to have more reasonable hours for parenting, or is she going to be replaced by another nanny? I realise there are points in a career when long hours are necessary, but is this your long-term plan as a couple? Is it possible for you *both* to cut down on work a bit, for instance?  

My point is this isn't a *wife and kids* problem. This is a *family* problem. The adults involved all enjoy their careers and that's great, but two of those adults chose to have children, so there are times when, for both of you, the career is going to have to be put on that back burner. "
"My guess is he dated someone younger than him when he was 18. May not of been 13. I am with you, I had several 14 year old (when I was 13/14, I am almost 30 now) friends dating 18-19 year olds and even had a friend get pregnant at 14.... at 14 years old you are no where mentally ready for that kind of a relationship. 16 dating 18.. maybe. But even then, Idk. "
"That's a hasty conclusion to jump to. I think that *sometimes* when a person​ accuses a partner of cheating they may be projecting because they're the one who's actually cheating, but not *usually*. If there's actual legitimate fishy behaviour, a person should be able to suspect their SO without people jumping to the idea that they're just accusing their SO because they're cheating, themselves.

In this case, OP is literally getting emails that indicate he's actively matching with people on a well known dating site. It's not ridiculous for his gf to be put off by that, even if OP is telling the truth about no longer being active on Match. 

Ideally if your partner tells you ""no I promise I'm not actually cheating, I don't know why I'm getting these emails"", you would trust them and move on. But a lot of people would need proof that their SO isn't cheating, when faced with emails suggesting otherwise. 
"
"It sounds like both you and your wife have unhealthy diets - you don't eat frequently enough, and she eats too frequently. 

I think you can attack both these problems at once by meal prepping together. Cook together at night when you're both home at the same time. Prepare several days worth of lunches and dinners and portion them out (really measure) them into tupperware in advance. For you - force yourself to eat, don't skip. Make lots of very tiny portions for yourself if that helps. For your wife - she can separate her dinner into two tupperware, one for when she gets home from work, and a second for when you get home. That way she doesn't miss out on sharing a meal with you but it doesn't increase her calorie intake. 

Meal prepping together gives you a common hobby and quality time together which will motivate both of you to do better in all areas of your life. And it will also help with both your diets. Even when you can't share a meal together, at least you can spend time together and commit to being healthy."

The skills to get a job are very different from the skills needed to keep a job.

Seriously? If he's already 43, you have very little to no time. I mean you could, but that's a big risk. Then he will be grandparent age to your kids. He won't get to see them grow up. I'm shocked you haven't seen to have even thought about it."
"I think this is 100% it. He assumes that lesbians see women the way he does, so she’s suddenly a threat, whether or not OP is attracted to Nina.

"&gt; everyone is harping on the wife's schedule and all but demanding she sacrifice her career, yet saying nothing about how the OP has quite clearly stated that he refuses to do the same.

"I’d also say, more broadly, that if your boyfriend expected to go to this wedding in the first place, he has a lot to learn about Indian family expectations.  He should be taking some initiative to learn about your cultural background rather than just assuming that he already understands. You also need to educate him about what the family expectations are going to be.  You also need to do some more thinking about what boundaries you’re going to set for yourself - where you’re going to follow family expectations and where you’ll go against them.  Your relationship with this guy is still young, but if you are anywhere near as serious as you say you are, you need to start at least talking about this stuff and thinking it through."

"She has not been saying the vitamin thing for five years, that's an assumption of yours (that you even admit to in another comment.)"
"Neither one of you is wrong.

She--assuming she is telling the truth--was assaulted, and likely suffered some degree of mental trauma. It's understandable that she would, even irrationally, try to soften the blow. If she--again, even irrationally--got it into her head that if she told you it was last week, she'd be assaulted *and* you'd break up with her, well, who can blame her for changing her story?

But, on the other hand--she did lie, and about something easily proven false. It's totally natural for you to distrust her now because of it... and if she lied about one thing, what else is she lying about? That's a perfectly normal reaction to being lied to. And her reaction can be taken one of two ways with equal probability: either she's upset that the person she trusted to tell didn't believe her and she's taking all her frustration and insecurities out on you (again, normal reaction after being assaulted), or she's projecting in an effort to make you back down (which is a typical reaction to being caught in a lie).

So neither one of you are wrong. She needs space right now, though... and frankly, whether she comes around or not is probably not up to you. If she's telling the truth, there's a good chance she's just going to funnel her feelings and end up blaming you--finding a scapegoat is a natural reaction to trauma, too. If she's lying, there's a good chance she'll break it off to avoid being sucked further into a lie.

Just be there for her. Tell her that you know things are messed up right now, but that you want to talk about it and try to work things out. Working things out doesn't mean admitting undeserved fault, just that you want to get past this."
"Yeah it's weird that you say you don't want a woman staying over at your bf's place. You live together! What are they going to do? Make out on the couch while you sit in an armchair?

"I'll use an old but true cliche (also a verse in a song by one of my favorite bands when I was your age) ""The first one is the worst one, when it comes to a broken heart"". I'll be honest, I don't have any spectacular advice on how to get over a break up, because there really isn't one right way to do so. Yes, it will hurt, and that is a completely normal feeling to have at a time like this. The most important thing I can stress is that this is not the end for you! 

Here's my own experience: I had gotten my first serious boyfriend at 14. I lost my virginity to him and all that jazz. About 9 months into our relationship, my mom passed away. The week after her funeral, he made a pretty horrible joke about her death. But, I was so desperate to feel something other than depression and loneliness, I stuck with the jackass for another year. And would you believe it still broke my heart when I dumped him? To make it worse, he showed up at my house soon afterwards unannounced, crying and begging to get me back (which I almost stupidly accepted because heartbreak sucks). It took some time, but I am  engaged to the love of my life and have an even more amazing relationship than the one I thought was perfect when I was 15.

TL;DR
Sweetie, you're gonna be more than okay &lt;3 I'm not the same person I was 6 months ago, let alone the person I was 6 YEARS ago. You have so much time to find yourself and the person that will fit with you perfectly!"

"You're feeding her, reading to her, playing with her, getting her to nap, keeping her alive. **You're not phoning it in!**

As to how you're feeling, you may with to talk to your doctor about a different antidepressant. They don't all work the same. 

You might try to get a sitter, have a date with your husband, and try some ""no stress"" sex. Tell him that it may or may not happen, so there should be no expectations. You aren't going to feel like sex until you feel human again and that can take time. 

Hang in there, mama.

"I'm seeing a lot of red flags in your relationship.

You never say no to sex. Control

He tells you went to get ready for bed. Control

He gets upset if you take a shower, morning or night. Control

You can't walk upstairs alone. Codependency

Themes of control, emotional manipulation/abuse and codependency are all common in a toxic relationship.

"I don't think it is a shitty ultimatum. I bet OP's wife would be presenting a very different picture of their finances, focusing on how they've both increased teir incomes and decreased their expenses so they have more coming in and are more comfortable, and the resounding response would be ""He doesn't want kids, he's just stringing you along"". 

And that's how she feels. They've both gotten pay increases, and he's in line for another increase in february, made big steps to decrease their expenses, and he's still saying ""We can't afford it"". Of course she thinks he'll never be ready and always have an excuse.

The bottom line is that his wife really wants kids and is willing to do whatever it takes to get them. It sounds like OP may not be."
"Leave. Please leave. You're so young and you don't deserve this. Leave as soon as possible. He's manipulating you to feel guilty and continue to stay with him.

"If you'd tell Luke that you are not comfortable with James in your life anymore because of this, and he plays it down to nothing, I think that would mean that it's Luke's test.

"I think marriage counseling is the way to go, not just to get everything on the table, but to see if indeed I can move on from this knowing the truth.  

Also, its not that I think I can't ever find love this strong again, I would just hate to have what's happening to me right now wind up happening to someone else that I date. It's not fair to whoever that might be in the future if I can't return they level of love."

"I lost money to a cheating ex (security deposit and a month of rent on an apartment I never lived in, plus hundreds of dollars I loaned him through the course of our relationship). My mom called it “the cost of a life lesson.” I didn’t like the feeling of absolute unfairness of it all - why should the lesson cost me when I did nothing wrong? - but she was ultimately right. 

In a while, you will look back on all of this and feel so grateful for the bullet you dodged and the life you’ll be living without her. But for a while, you’re gonna be feeling a lot of things. Pissed, hurt, inadequate, enraged, blindsided, humiliated, sad. Those are all okay feelings and they are valid. You can’t suppress them or just get over it; these are not things you want to permanently internalize. Work through it. Therapy is a great idea. A therapist can help you develop healthy coping mechanisms and work through those emotions in a way that is beneficial rather than hurtful. 

In the meantime, make yourself as busy as possible. See every movie you can. Go to the gym or take up a new sport. Indulge hobbies you’ve been curious about. Call friends and relatives just to chat about their lives. Just keep your mind as busy as possible.

You will get through this and come out of it stronger than ever, and sooner than you think. Hell, when my parents met, my dad was two weeks out from his divorce and my mom had just broken off an engagement to someone else. They’ve been married for 33 years. You will be fine.

"Uhhh im a woman and I think encouraging your partner to get an STD test is a-okay. In fact, you SHOULD do it no matter how upsetting it is to her because regardless of the psychological difficulties the physical difficulties of having an STD and not knowing is something that needs to be dealt with asap. It's not even just about him, I'd worry about her health too? She could fuck up her fertility for the rest of her life out of a temporary fear of going to the doctor. I believe in treating victims with a caring, gentle hand but that does not include shelving every single legitimate concern and STDs are a legit one. You CAN approach this from logic and rationality and in fact you SHOULD. not ever emotional problem needs to be treated emotionally. Even if she cant be rational, he needs to be right now. "

How do you know? And since we are talking about the dangers of her future, how does that matter if there is also the incident or violent drug use?

"This kinda reminds me of the guy who would only eat beans but in OP's case, it's dangerous stuff.

"I'm not saying they're right or wrong, but I think I see the origin of the bad dynamic that developed between you and your soon to be two exes.  They both thought they were competing for your time with your friend, with whom you would be spending about half of your free time if you had your way.  

Here is how misunderstandings can develop.  Let us suppose there was a night when a woman you were seeing could not make a date.  Fine you say to yourself, you'll just go off and either online game or even see in person your friend.  To you this seems innocent.  To the woman you are dating, this seems punishment for her not giving you her time.  And from this comes jealousy.

I don't have a good answer.  From your perspective, if you have free time and are otherwise not occupied being with the one you are dating, why not go online and game with your friend?  But I just don't think gaming 3 nights a week with your friend **and** seeing her as often as you can is going to fly with many women you might date."

"She's in the process of applying to college, and in her senior year. I'm not sure she'd be able to transfer schools without it throwing off all of her academics. If it were easy, I'd find a way in a heartbeat. She only has to live there till she graduates high school. I don't know much about how that would look on an academic transcript, or if my mother would let her do that (although I suppose it's fair game once she turns 18 in January, in which case I'd find a way to try and get her into a school here). 

My sister doesn't want them to divorce ""during the most important year of her life (applying to college)"" so I'm not sure she'd be... amicable to uprooting her life to live with me. I keep telling her that there will be no future to her life if something happens. Just today she told me that he tried to beat her but ""how will I go to college if he's arrested.""

On a more serious note, try not to get deeply involved with people who speak in riddles and decline to clarify wtf they mean."
and needs to step up when he kid fucks up. thats a parent's job. 
"Well that's indicative the problem, isn't it? You shouldn't have to have your own small female that belongs to you in order to see that girls and women are human beings who don't belong to anyone. Respect shouldn't be accorded to a woman only due to her relationship with a man. "
Being reallly hammered or stoned can also make this happen to some people. 
"He also volunteered the information, so I don't think she should necessarily have known that he didn't want to talk about it. OP mentions that the teacher knew from some time in the past that the friend was a veteran (from him telling stories about it?) but college professors can see thousands of students a year. It seems a bit OTT to assume that she absolutely remembered.


I think this is a case of the intense valor that many people give to veteran's experiences getting in the way - e.g. he's allowed to say what happened to him in what is presumably a critical discussion, but no one else is allowed to ask questions or respond critically to it. 


If the friend would like to speak to the prof about it after next class, send an email, or have OP express his discomfort to the prof I think that would be appropriate. However, I think it would be a bit mad to get mad about this. Prof shouldn't have to accept anecdotal evidence from a student just because she may know or assume that he's a veteran/has PTSD. He volunteered the info in what sounds like a critical discussion of some research. "
"&gt;What’s the difference between this and a fwb type relationship? 

That you literally pay someone to have sex with you. And it isn't even legal where they're from.


&gt;If your son is 18 and has never spoken or held hands with a girl this probably will allow him to be comfortable around the opposite sex.

Even if it helps, the way the husband did it was _so_ wrong. Springing on him suddenly with this?


&gt;What’s worse, waiting until 23-24 to figure out what sex is or this. 

**What's bad about that?!**


&gt;Plus the son is 18, I’m sure if didn’t want to go forth he could’ve said no. 

It seems the dad was quite pushy about it, has tried to normalize it and suddenly sprang on him with this. 


I think we found the husband, haha."
"Maybe in general, but I cannot imagine most people are ok with walking in cat poop all day."
"Yes, but this is a 5 year old child who the OP has never met. Why couldn't her brothers look after her for one afternoon? I suspect the dad is a sexist creep and believes that women are supposed to do things like emergency babysitting. "
"Real talk, but I guess I needed to hear it. This seems to be the consensus so I'm just going to drop the issue unless she brings it up herself."
"Yep, I lost my dad and stepmom to the ever so wonderful herbalife cult for two years. Thank God they snapped out of it."
"&gt; Huge rex flag. 

Tyrannosaur huge! "
"Obviously cut Mark off. But here's the thing. Instead of giving Mark money, you should have given the money to your Fiance instead. To someone going through money troubles who is kinda sleazy, giving them 200 dollars will lead to them just pocketing it. Your fiance could have at least spent the money on having a good time, even if by himself!

That said, a lot of this is also on Steve. He didn't have to stay in the hotel, he could have just gone out and enjoyed it, he chose to stay with his friends. "
I think /r/raisedbynarcissists would make more sense.
"OP said he was an uncle. Presumably, he has siblings and other relatives. Every parent has to think of who will care for their kids in the event of a tragedy. Most of my family is estranged, but I still have a close couple friend who has offered to step up should anything happen to me. 

Also, life insurance and mortgage insurance. If I die an untimely death, my kids get a fully paid off house in a very expensive city, with rental income to supplement their benefits, so my friends (who are perfectly self supporting) will have the resources to pay for anything they might need.

You don't need a spouse to have a kid, you need a support system."
"Can I date your brother? Dude sounds hilarious. 

On a more serious note: just text your brother, tell him the situation and have him explain he was joking to your boyfriend. Kind of awkward, but gets the job done "
You are both being abused. I'm sorry. Your mother has strange parenting ideas. Seek help at school. 
then he has NO excuse for not getting it 
"Honestly I wouldn't listen to the people that are romanticizing this with ""free spirit"" talk. Your girlfriend(ex-girlfriend?) sounds mentally unstable. Imagine what she must have told her mom to make it so she is ignoring your calls. You were together a year and she's ghosting you, abandoning most of her stuff, and making it so you can't get any info about her whereabouts. That's crazy stuff. I know this is hard, but the reason you can't wrap your head around it is because you're not crazy. What she's doing isn't logical, it makes no sense. At best, she is mentally ill, and at worst she's a complete asshole."
"She used to work as an educator, but she quit her job to stay at home and raise the child. Right now, she is essentially a housewife. We sometimes go out on the weekends to the mall or other places to shop and have fun. She has friends and family in China that she does video calls with, and we do occasionally invite friends over.

As for therapy, they don't really do therapy in China. She hasn't seen anyone since she came over, if that's what you're thinking. She did briefly talk to my mother about anxiety medication, but she is skeptical about it."
"But her answer was pretty intense. (""I almost yelled 'are you insane?' as soon as I heard that if she can stay here for a week in the living room from my boyfriend. It's beyond imaginable for me to have someone of opposite gender stay over at my boyfriend's place."")

She clearly has very strong views on male/female friendships. I think it's pretty important for them to hash this out further, because those views are an element of compatibility."
"I have had to have what I call the Get A Grip Talk with two of my siblings. It goes something like ""I love you unconditionally. I want you to think about that for a minute, think about how many people you have that would say that. It's you and me, there is nothing you can do that will make me stop loving you... so don't even bother lying to me, there's no reason for it. If you don't know you're lying to me, then that's because you're lying to yourself. I'll be here when you're ready to tell the truth...to both of us"".

Varying degrees of success, but reasonably effective against weapons-grade stupidity.

"
"If she can’t comprehend, tell her that her father marrying your mother doesn’t make her anything to you. She is the adult child of our mom’s husband. That’s it. My mother remarried when I was in my early twenties. Her new husband has kids around 10 and 12 years younger than me. They are just my mother’s husband’s kids. That’s it. For that matter my mother’s third husband isn’t even remotely a step-father. Just my mother’s husband. "
"Two comments to add:

1.  He seems to be too old for you.  The age difference is substantial and I can understand your parent's concern.

2. You should definitely move out and be on your own.  You are old enough and you will never grow and mature as an individual while you still live under your parent's roof. Living with your parents may be part of their culture, but it is a culture they left behind when they moved here.  "
"Just deal with it. She's not your property.

It sucks being objectified all the time but it also sucks dealing with an SO who feels like he has ownership over your image."
"""All of this time is unpaid."" 

whhhhaaaattttt? NO. IT. IS. NOT!

if you believe that, he certainly will too! and it is not AT ALL the right way to look at it. 

if you worked for a larger company doing exactly that same work, looking for clients, maintaining existing client relationships, planning later work, etc... you would be paid by the boss for that time. either a salary or hourly, but it would certainly count as ""work hours"".

in that case, you personally would be paid regularly, the company would smooth out the lighter and heavier months for you, but they would also take a cut for having done so. 

you ARE the company. so you experience that fluctuation yourself. but you also don't loose the cut. 

after all, if your business expanded to the point that *you* needed an assistant, they would certainly expect to get paid regularly for handling your correspondence and admin. you sure wouldn't get away with only paying them for work that directly led to immediate $!

at the moment you are your own assistant.

so try framing it like that to him. 

i'm self employed too. 

i keep two bank accounts, business and personal. every month i write myself a check from the business to the personal account and pay personal bills from that. makes it easier to track business expenses this way. but also, if i had a SO who didn't trust what i was up to, it would sure look like a smoother income. ;)





"
"Yes! And even without kids, you don't know these people. She doesn't even know them very well. She's known them less than a year. 

When I was in my early 20s, parent's house got robbed. It got robbed because friends of acquaintances of mine overheard my acquaintances talking about how nice it was inside and the expensive stuff my parents have. Even if these friends of your sisters are okayish, if they hang out with other less okayish people and talk about your home, you could be targeted. "
That is what they should have done in the first place.
"No matter how he intended it, he still said his ex is prettier. That's like saying they were better in bed. Even if it's true, even if the intent is good, it really never needs to be said."
"You guys need counseling to work on your communication, and he should look into anger management. You should not be bottling up your frustration about his lack of helping around the house, and he should not be resorting to name-calling and physical violence. 

Please let the counselor know that he threw something at you while you were holding the baby.

Also, why agree to do the grocery shopping during baby's naptime? Why not just plan to meet later, since you expected to be late anyway?"
She's doing this on purpose. Time to find a new tenant for the guest room so you can move out.
"Sucking it up for another 3 years (If you can't persuade them not to go) isn't the same as being trapped for the rest of your life. 

Tell them that you're against them moving and then let it go.  If they choose to ruin their lives , that's on them. You don't owe them anything - they had you for their own selfish reasons. 

Save as much money as you can while studying, then move away when you're done. 

"
"Awesome. And just as a gentle piece of advice, ask around town about this attorney. S/he may be awesome, and if so, great! But you need the best family law attorney, and that doesn't always correlate with the most prominent men's rights attorney. It could! I'm not saying it can't! But keep in mind that whoever you don't hire will be available to represent your gf. "
"It's always a judgment call, and sometimes you make the wrong call. But it's really hard to understand the circumstances from the outside.

What matters is what your girlfriend wants. Keeping in mind, realistically, that there's not likely to be any legal recourse, what would make your girlfriend feel SAFEST? She could really want to yell at the guy but feel too timid, and that's something you can work through with her. Or she could really want to avoid confrontation, in which case you can talk to her about modifying her routine, etc. Your job as her partner is to help her do what SHE will find empowering."
I just want to reiterate that you're not asking for too much here! You are an official resident of this apartment now and you are entitled to input on who comes over and when. Just because she's family and has always been welcome to use this as her personal space doesn't mean it gets to continue now that you live there too.
"And maybe get some new friends, too."
"If you've already told the horse about water, it's kind of a waste to give it new facts about mineral water.

Just let the horse make it's own stupid decisions."
"Isolating you from your friends and family is a typical abusive pattern. It's something abusers do to control their partners before they unleash the real abuse so that they have nowhere to go.

I would be extremely, extremely concerned. This is one of the reddest of red flags."
Why are you still with him? He sounds awful. 
"""If I see any of your decorations outside of your room, you'll next find it in the bin.""  "
"&gt; This is also the first year she's made me a REALLY expensive birthday present. She's never even made me one before. 

Well, you gave her a fairly large gift as well.  One that seems to have had enough impact to shake her out of whatever was making her so awkward around you. 

More than just saving money on rent, she has security in her living situation and has seen you are willing to really step up and help when she is in need.

&gt; And this year she gives me a bunch of these expensive skin care products. SIL is really into skincare and makeup and I very much am not. But all the products were really thoughtful! Aimed at insecurities I've definitely complained about in her presesence. But I didn't realize how expensive they were until I went to look up how to use them.

It is very possible that some of these were impulse purchases she had accumulated over time but never ended up using.  If she did get them on impulse it means they were also probably on sale for a good price.

&gt;  I appreciate the gift, the products are actually changing my mind about skincare

The best thing you can do to 'repay' her for the gift is to tell her this.  I promise it will mean the world to her.

I don't think you need to have a conversation about this not becoming a habit until you see clear signs of that happening.  Trust her to deal with her own financial situation for now."
"Because he knows it’s important to her and doesn’t seem to care, and only brings up getting married when she’s on the edges. It’s not about the “government getting involved”. This is like the definition of flaky. 
And let’s stop with the whole *poor men* thing, women get screwed just as much in divorces. "
"Making it into a joke maybe? Like, he calls you an annoying b*tch, you counter with ""yeah well you're a silly wanker aren't you"" in an affectionate way. For your own sake - like, if I heard something like that, even knowing it was totally unimportant and unconscious and random, and it just hung in the air, I might be more meh-feeling about it than if I play it off to myself as the joke that it is out loud."
"This is a very hot button issue for a lot of folks. I'm guessing you feel uncomfortable subjugating your son's to a (largely unnecessary) procedure. 

The compromise here is to tell your boyfriend that you cannot condone having the procedure done on someone when they are too young to consent on their own. If your son decides that he'd prefer to be circumcised at a reasonable age (16?),  you will be happy to facilitate that."
It is an extremely common topic with couples. And if his future gf/wife asks how he lost it and he avoids the topic or tells them the true story there is a decent chance she'd be freaked out.
"&gt; I am open to the idea but am not sure how valuable it would be for us, especially because I already know that I'm the one who f'ed up.

Knowing this is great, but it's only step one. You and your wife have a lot of accumulated feelings to work through, and you could use some outside help as they come to the surface. Things may get worse before they get better, as your wife may realize how much anger and resentment and sadness your emotional absence has caused. You yourself may unearth some surprising feelings as you try to inject some life back into your marriage. 

A counselor will have the sort of tools you both need to express yourselves and try to get back on track. Keep in mind, they're not miracle workers - both of you have to really make an effort to see any results. And you may do everything ""right"" and still arrive at the conclusion that you'd be better off apart. 

I hope you can repair this. I really do. But you're extremely unlikely to be able to do it alone. Do the research and shop around for a counselor that feels like a good fit for you both, and prepare for some discomfort as you unpack the damage of the last few years. If you really want to try and salvage a loving marriage, it'll be worth it."
"Poor kids. You sexed a guy once, and is now in love? "
"So they want to be able to travel, but they don't care if their ""secret"" wedding screws up *your* travel plans? I would stick to your plans and not even worry about it. They are completely unreasonable and if they want you there for the whole thing so much, let them change *their* plans."
"I am pretty proud to have solidly achieved ""mom-level"" cooking.  I don't do much that's fancy, but I can reliably, night after night, pump out solid, healthy, tasty options to feed the family.

My husband does the fancier stuff but it just takes so much effort he only has the energy to do it occasionally. I, on the other hand, bust out most meals in 30-45 minutes including prep and cleaning, and do it 5-6 days a week.  

When we went to Cracker Barrel and grumbled a little about how it's just regular food, and if I'm going out to dinner I want something better than regular food.  A family friend narrowed her eyes at me and said:  ""Dude.  This is nostalgic for most of us because this tastes like what mom made.  You are now mom."""
"Also, if you're feeling catty when they pull the ""she didn't choose to be born"" line, you can also say ""I didn't choose to have my dad commit adultery."" :)"
So is she on birth control? If not the first thing you do is discuss it with her and hopefully she agrees to take the morning after pill that you will purchase for her. All else is secondary to that. 
"""Is there ANYTHING I could say to her, even something remotely polite, that would let her know how much she hurt me?""

If that had any effect at all, wouldn't that be at least as likely to give her the warm feel of victorious superiority as even (an easily forgotten) twinge of guilt?  Why give her anything at all?  I do hope you managed to get a very favorable property settlement."
"I'm not sure why you would bother to send him anything anymore. You are mere *weeks* into dating - not even a couple - and he's already proving to be stubborn, disrespectful, overbearing, judgmental, ridiculous, and basically an asshole. What do you see in him that makes this worth pursuing when it's already such a shitfest? Where do you see this going? Do you think it gets better from here? I doubt that it does, I *highly* doubt it.

I agree that this sounds like ""negging"", and that's abusive behavior."
"I think that was probably the intent, but not how OP took it. I probably wouldn't have taken it that way either until after I got upset and then later on reflected on it and then gotten the intent."
"&gt; Trying to ""sleep off"" a concussion could've ended up with your friend's death

Not to split hairs because this is all spot on - you can sleep with a concussion. The only reason that you're often instructed to get up every few hours is for monitoring purposes because if your condition suddenly changes (i.e. can't see out of one eye, ear ringing, sudden pain) you can't tell anyone because you're asleep. A lot of people think you can't sleep at all, but it's actually better if you do. You just are instructed to not sleep for longer than 2-3 hours at a time with 5-10 minute 'awake' periods to note symptoms. 

Anyway, I agree with your points. This likely isn't the one-and-done situation OP's friend may believe it to be. This is likely years of culminating issues and this was the straw (more like a brick) that broke the camel's back. "
"OP, the way you feel reading this ... a joke at your expense, when you are reaching out for advice and help ... this is akin to how your girlfriend felt. Except the joke at her expense wasn't made by an internet stranger, it was made by her romantic partner, who is supposed to have her back. "
"Man you did nothing wrong... it sounds like she was searching for this and its kind of a red flag.

If she is upset at you for an old profile that's another red flag!

2 red flags in one go! Not good brother..."
"I guess she does have a ""life of the party"" personality. People love spending time with her and she's very at ease in crowds. Sometimes she achieves that by bad mouthing others and spreading gossip to get plus points with people. We've been friends for years, it's something I've learned to just ignore but recently she's been spiraling a bit out of control on occasion, being unnecessarily mean. "
"&gt;when a guy finds that friend more attractive then their partner.

To be fair he didn't say that at all. He said his friend is pretty (and there is nothing at all wrong with acknowledge that a person, even if you are not attracted to them, is pretty or not) and that his gf can be insecure about her looks (which is a totally different thing, hell some of the most attractive people I Know are the ones most insecure about their looks!)."
"But Luke didn't warn you about James's test, either. He basically knows that his brother is likely to assault his girlfriends but gives none of them a heads up--why else would this have happened repeatedly?

This is a win-win situation for him. He gets to do nothing and have the excuse of having done nothing while letting his brother play this stupid game that he benefits from."
"Whether she's innocent or hunting is irrelevant. My takeaway was your BFs go to move was to show you the screenshot. Clearly he knows how you feel about exes and respects it. Nice!

She could have a shrine to him and pray to The Elder Gods to get back together with him, but it doesn't matter if your boyfriends not interested in her. "
"Is MIL moving closer to you an option?  Staying in your guest room for a *previously agreed upon* period of time? (That's important, make sure you set a time limit on that along with household boundaries.)"
"Go ahead and get a mattress cover.

This happened with my boyfriend when I was around your age. We were both under a lot of stress, and he had a couple of accidents (one of which was unfortunately at a friend's house.) I did my best not to make a big deal out of it, and the issue went away after a couple of weeks.

With that being said, it sounds like this is an ongoing issue for your bf, and something he should talk to a doctor about. Start by asking him when the last time he went in for a check up."
You said it. I’m definitely running. I think I just grew up today. 
"Don't do it. Not because she's a ""9.5"" and you're a ""6"" but because this is weird, and inappropriate. You don't know her. You have no reason to gift this to her. Please reconsider. "
"Dang, we all need a Gavin. Sorry that wasn't enough for you :("
"Yeah, I was never around my parents when they sold drugs, but I still noticed how they acted like drug addicted assholes. Now I'm never around them at all, full no contact for 7 years. But good luck. "
I'm a senior in a high school and the idea of dating a sophomore/15 year old is icky to me.
