It’s not a neutral environment.  You’re meeting with him and HIS therapist.  There is NOTHING neutral about that.
"Just going to second /u/hellyhock.  Trust/estate lawyer right f-ing now.  You want to understand the inheritance mechanism and anything you can do to protect it. 

Do not do **anything** to co-mingle the inherited funds with community property accounts/assets/whatever.  For example, don't even pay the estate lawyer with community funds.

 If you ultimately want to share that's up to you, but man not under the current circumstances."
"This should be the top comment. There's a reason she's the only person he does this to. He cares about the impression she makes on others more than he cares about her. And she's not even making a bad impression, he's just aiming his anxious, controlling nature at her because she's easier to ""control"" than other friends/strangers.

Kinda sad TBH, but can probably be overcome if he goes to therapy."
"Calling breasts ""baby feeders"" is gross."
"Yeah!!! I've had this happen to me too, they called me out on it ... Not fun. There's gotta be a way for us to give out a number?? Not a scam number or something. We shouldn't have to give out our personal details, make fake accounts, etc etc because fuckers can't handle a ""no."""
"&gt; do you want to stay with someone who lied by omission

I don’t think this is just about information though. He decided to keep this woman in his life. He made active decisions to have his wife socialize with a woman who had an affair with him.

It isn’t just information about his past that he didn’t reveal. It’s actions that he took during his marriage."
"I completely agree with every last bit of this. 

Do you have the contact information for his doctor? I would call and say he is having a manic episode and is losing touch with reality - the hope in doing this is they can put him on a temporary psychiatric hold while you focus on your children's safety and possible legal action in the interim."
Your siblings lives isn’t a direct correlation on your life and how well it’s going. 
She has been gone for seven years and who know what has happened. I totally agree with this and she is going to need a lot of professional help that they can't offer and they will need a plan to guide her along before even thinking about letting her in
"“Greater heights in life” unless you are Shelly miscavige’s grandkid and you get money free and clear from Scientology, it’s not worth the money or the relationship. 

You know your grandma and you know she would put your education first. Grief makes people act weird so act as graciously as possible while not spending a grand on the saddest occasion when your gramma wouldn’t want you to "
"I don't think it's that he thinks your son is ugly, or he doesn't like that he looks like you. Its that he doesn't like that he ONLY looks like you, especially if people (including you) are bringing it up all the time. It probably feels like he's being pushed out. 

You two need to have a really honest conversation. Tell him it upsets you when he says things like that. Use a lot of sentances that start with I feel. And hopefully he'll reciprocate. Hopefully you two can come to a compromise, maybe something like he doesnt say hurtful things about how he doesn't like that your child looks like you, and you won't say things about how your child looks like only you, and if someone brings it up with you, you'll deflect by bringing up what does come from your husband. "
Exactly. Until a couple of hours ago Op had no idea he kept a 15 year old affair which involves kids. She doesn't know a thing about her husband other than he is a liar. 
"You didn't answer my question. If she's willing to sit in a hot car, she's willing to sit in a hot car."
"From what you've wrote, I feel like you should focus less on the coworker and more on your needs in a relationship. She doesn't want sex? Thats cool, whatever, respect her boundaries. But the fact that she seems repulsed by your touch and brushes you off when speaking about your feelings is a huge red flag. I think you might need to reflect a little, think about your own emotional needs in the relationship, are you giving her all the emotional/financial/physical needs for her to be happy but accepting neglect of those same needs for yourself?"
"Seems like you are treating men as some kind of different species. That's probably part of your problem. 

Also, what are we talking about here? Guys don't like you? So you are saying not enough guys approach you?"
Yes. Society has decided balls are more comparable to female breasts than female breasts are to male breasts. Sorry. That’s just centuries of culture that isn’t going to change instantly just because you don’t agree. 
I guess you need to ask yourself was each of these persons that rejected you someone you’d want to be with long term? Because if you meet 7 people in a year and know that you’d like a relationship with each and every one of them you’re either very very lucky or not very picky. Chances are they weren’t all LTR relationship material and they just called it before you did. 
"just some examples: co-ed sports leagues, hobby classes (cooking, dance, pottery), hiking groups, city/community events, ask friends to set you up with on a blind date



...and as much as a lot of people groan at the idea: online dating 

sometimes its just a matter of getting some experience under your belt and putting yourself out there."
"Only in a paradise, a dang utopia, Shangri-La should he respond to your texts for a date. 

You were a nasty bully and only when you saw how good looking and how much money he makes (ooohhh 250k) do you want to start dating him. You deserve to be humbled. It sounds like you haven’t changed at all. 

I agree with deepmind_is_skynet. He might say yes, just to burn you later. Leave him alone to find someone less shallow and who doesn’t rank people according to looks."
"Please understand that it doesn't matter HOW you say something, it matters WHAT is said. Just because your bf is not running around screaming slurs at people doesn't mean that he isn't racist: he believes white people are superior to others based on race: that is literally the definition of racism and it is not ok. Yes, you are going down a slippery slope of becoming racist yourself and being brainwashed. Please dump him and stop associating with racists. "
Once in my first adult relationship and a 15 year affair with a married person are apples and oranges.
Ask for his phone make sure he deleted it and didn't back it up anywhere. Tell him if you ever find the video online you will press charges. Also remind him that filming someone without their consent is super fucking illegal and it can get him registered on the sex offender list. Or you can take his phone and go straight to the police.
"So my wife's best friend is a neurologist.  She's cute and fun, but perpetually single.  My wife and I have brainstormed why but can t really come up with a reason, at least not one that I would feel comfortable telling her.  

I used to think that it was just a stats game and that the number of men (even other well educated professionals) who don t find her intimidating is just too low.  

But lately iv e come to realize that some of the characteristics that have driven her to achieve also  make some interactions with her come across as offputting.  It's very subtle, but if I had to try to put it in words i would say that she teeters on the border of attractive confidence and dismissive elitism.  

I've known her for years, so this wouldn t bother me one bit.  But, as you said, in today's dating world where you can just swipe left, people just might not be giving her the chance she deserves."
"Thank you both.

Indeed, I feel a bit overly forgiving. The way you framed/rephrased it is quite helpful."
"I have a serious problem with the “baby cousin” line. She’s an adult. She can join the military. Buy cigarettes. She’s not a baby. Infantilising her isn’t helping at all, it’s hurting."
"He's Male. He doesn't HAVE a biological clock.

I'm not dismissing his desire to get started on kids, but  nobody can blame it on  biology. He can wait 3 frigging years. 

Year 1: enjoy being newly-weds. 

Year 2: deal with Graves' and recover from surgery. 

Year 3: Go off birth control. 

See if he finds that a reasonable compromise."
"That's a seven year age difference which is a huge chunk of OP's lifespan to date. If my older brother had brought home a 25 year old when he was 18, I would be alarmed as hell too, never mind what my parents would have to say. It's creepy"
"While she's going at it the wrong way, I generally understand her feeling this way. 25 and 18 is creepy.

I would wait till she's ready and then try to talk about it. Tell her you understand what you did wrong. Ask her about reasonable boundaries. "
"I’ve seen this on reddit a few times but it’s definitely not an actual tradition. Emily Post calls it a “modern myth” that the hosts’ expenses should dictate the price of the gift, and has this to say on traditional etiquette: “The amount you spend is strictly a matter of your budget, how close you are to the bride and groom, and what you think they would like. While it would be tempting to assign dollar values, everyone’s financial circumstances and relationships are different.”"
HAHA glad I could brighten your Sunday 
You honestly cannot fathom how it would make someone uncomfortable to see someone’s nipples constantly? It’s great that it doesn’t bother you but it is absolutely silly to say you “can’t imagine” who it would bother. If that were the case no women under a C cup would ever wear bras. 
"I don't really think walking around the streets topless with DD breasts flying about and having 'fuck my ass' written on your face is the same as wearing a t-shirt without a bra. (And I don't take selfies ever, I don't use social media anymore) "
[deleted]
"""It's a private matter and no one else's business"" is the cliché standard rationalization for all forms of child abuse! Where do you draw the line?"
"&gt; I am sympathetic of her struggles

Are you? In what way?"
Also here if you need a listener. You’re tough and acknowledgement of an issue is the first step to correcting it.
I wanted to be blunt and straight to the point. I hate writing and reading threads that are very long and rambly.
"Providing for your son is what's expected. It's not a ""killer deal."" How about you add a loving environemt where his choices are respected?  

But don't worry. Once you get divorced, I'm sure your husband will offer your son those things and he'll gladly accept... Since it's such an awesome deal.  Then you can boss around anyone else living in your house. "
"Violence by strangers happens disproportionately to men, at least according to the United Nations. 

If you are going to just apply your agenda (no matter how much I agree with you) please do it with facts. When people make things up about how women have things worse than men it takes validity away from real claims."
"&gt;Ok. You know that there are many many men out in this world who have zero problem with circumcision?

That may be true, but then doesn't it make more sense to allow them to make that choice for themselves once they reach the age of majority? In all other areas, people would not *dream* of performing an unnecessary cosmetic surgery on an infant who cannot consent. Yet routine infant circumcision seems to get a weird pass on that general philosophy. It's not logical."
"that was most likely about David Reimer, yes. Now obviously this happening is quite rare, but it begs the question: *why perform routine infant circumcision at all, if it has no medical benefit and this is a possible outcome?*"
"He shouldn't get a say, but it would be pretty hard for me to be around someone who chose to do this in 2018. "
"I agree, but it sounds like some of this is non-verbal. I sometimes think people who are silent when a person normally would be friendly come across as super rude too :/ the body language and silence put together can just be really awkward. 

If the only other option is outright SAYING something rude, then silence is definitely better, but silence + grappling with internal emotions has its own effect if there’s not a nicer person there to say something in the silence. Strangers aren’t comparing you to yourself and thinking, “Hey, at least she’s thinking before she speaks now!” They’re comparing you to other people they meet who would normally be friendly and polite. 

No advice here but just offering a different perspective based on my experience with people that I think grapple with this same problem. I think your “say it nicely” advice is spot on. "
This is the absolute best problem I’ve ever seen on this sub. Your gf is fucking adorable. 
"I think OP wants to think it's a deal-breaker, because who wants to admit ""I'm okay with someone violating my privacy?"" If she can make excuses or convince herself that she's crazy, she can keep the ""good"" parts of the relationship while overlooking the rest of it that is utter and complete garbage. "
"Religion, pain, and hope are hugely popular themes in fiction, as is the story set up you're describing. There's actually a point in a fiction narrative called the dark night of the soul to describe when a character has lost everything. it's comes right before the character becomes a hero. 

i think it's totally normal to project your experiences onto the page you saw, but that doesn't make it real. You need to talk about this with your wife. "
So it's not okay to drink but it's okay to get divorced? Is he just picking the rules he wants to follow?
"Yeah I agree completely, this is just weird as hell. Like, one ""girl's night"" sleepover once a year or something? Sure, sounds like fun. Multiple nights a month, wtf? "
"Gas lighting is emotional abuse, they’ve manipulated your emotions which is why you feel torn. It also warps your sense of reality so you believe them when they tell you you’re too sensitive, unreasonable, etc. Seriously, talk about this stuff in therapy. I promise it will give you tremendous insight."
"She'll figure it out sooner or later, because I guarantee this is going to keep coming up in their relationship."
"Listen very hard to the fact that he doesn’t trust himself. At 6 months, I would let him loose so he can go take her up on her opportunity. (She probably would not have fucked him. Lol)

Sad day when he has to smoke weed, masturbate, forget instead of paying attention to what he actually has. Find a better guy, hon. "
Work on myself. I think the relationship will either be fine cuz I'm more confident or I'll find someone more suited to me. 
You’ve been together six months. You don’t need to be helping him with buying a house. This is something he needs to do himself. 
"Yeah but they shouldn't completely lose their minds, scream at their partner, call their friends horrible names, and threaten divorce in an ""or else"" way that makes their partner feel controlled. You can state your boundaries without screaming, and even saying ""I don't want to be in a marriage where my partner drinks"" has a completely different tone than a threat. Especially when you speak it instead of yell it!

But yes, people are allowed to have whatever boundaries they want. It doesn't mean some of them aren't insane, however. This is insane. The way he reacted is horrible and must have been terrifying for OP. 

Someone saying ""no female friends!"" and screaming at their partner when they look at another woman is technically a boundary, but still controlling. Sure OP is technically free to just leave if she wants to drink, but I doubt she really feels that way. It's still extremely controlling of him to flip out over something that is really just a normal part of most people's lives. He got scary with her and you're telling me it's a-okay? No way."
She was probably just really sad and surprised. Now if it continues ... Yeah that would be manipulative because then she's using the crying to try to guilt him into changing his behavior.
"Exactly. Its disrespectful and doesn’t deserve to be excused on the basis of being male. 

My little anecdote that good men exist: I once accidentally stumbled across this before I was even technically exclusive with my SO. (We were on our third date and he was showing me something/ I accidentally tapped on a message notification or something like that.)

Friend: Want to go try to meet girls tonight?
SO: No, I’m a one woman man and I really like this girl 🤩
Friend: Cool man! Happy for you. 

This is not “a guy thing” and you don’t have to accept it, OP! "
"Please reread what you wrote with a critical eye.

You are setting the bar of your ""ideal man"" at the height of ""lying, cheating scumbag who I can't talk to about my past"". Do you not see how  terrible that is?

There are people out there who will love you and make you feel amazing while also being loyal and thoughtful. I don't know what has happened in your life to make you settle for a guy that is the equivalent of gum in your shoe, but know that you are much better than that. **You deserve better.**"
"I agree with the other commenter. 

Theyre 24&amp;23, and only been dating for 6 months. Give them some space and time to figure things out and figure out what they are and were they stand with each other. Some differences that look bad on paper could really click well in practice, if they balance each other out. But its not gonna happen overnight or without some hiccups. 

You and your bf aren't much older than them either, it's really not your place to be giving talks on what constitutes great relationships, or having private talks with about the relationship with either of them. Ted needs to stop running back and forth between his brother and his gf about ""he said she said"" nonsense. 

Also, 6 months is a little soon to meet the family, maybe slowing things down a smudge might be good for them. You seem to be trying too hard to click and get to know her. It's been 6 months, and you're her boyfriend's brother's girlfriend. She doesn't really need to get to know you that well just yet. She probably has her own social life, as well as whatever work/study going on, and a new relationship to ease into. 

Just keep your opinions between you and your bf and give this new couple space and time. "
"My parents are aware of what happened with the intimidation and how he wouldn't let me leave the car, I told my mom right away even though it was late at night and my mom talked to my dad about it in the morning and my dad asked me if he had to intervene, but I told him no. They've given me advice about what to say and how to handle the situation but I still feel lost. I just don't understand how everything flipped so unexpectedly. My boyfriend gotten really angry twice before, but nothing close to how it was this time. "
"You acted like a douche before your illness, and your illness clearly didn't change that. Stop blaming other factors take responsibility for doing something shitty, move on and leave the poor girl alone. "
"&gt;He’s now been yelling, cussing, 

No matter what, he should NOT be doing this. "
"Went thru something similar and the best thing I heard was when you can no longer take care of yourself (she can’t) you can no longer make all the decisions.  While sad for her, she cannot use her 13 year old like this any more.  Get him out of that house. If she then wants to be alone with daily nurse visits and they find her broken on the floor the next day then that was her choice.  As stated, the current situation is child abuse."
Im sorry but that’s the most idiotic thing I’ve heard all year. This is what toxic masculinity has come to? Freakin strawberries?
We had a prank war in an office I worked in. People did stuff like change each others' computer background to a Justin Bieber wallpaper or put a sticky note on the bottom of someone's mouse so they'd think it wasn't working. It was honestly a fun distraction from a very boring job.
"It sounds like the relationship started because it was a convenient situation, but now that it's not convenient for him he doesn't want to put the effort in. There's nothing you can do to convince him to give up his free time to visit you. I'd break up with him and find someone who can make time for you."
"I guess I still don't understand why you are so adamant about going to this session. Most of the responses here are telling you the reasons why participating in therapy with abusers is not recommended. And there are alternatives offered too: email the counselor to give the information you think they need to know re: the abuse. Or go to a session with the counselor without your husband present, to discuss whatever you need to. You can't fix him. You can't save him. You can't even get him to seek proper treatment. Because if he wanted to, he would do that. And the fact that you need to press him means he's only doing the bare minimum possible to keep you hanging on. He doesn't care that he's hurt you. He just doesn't want to suffer any consequences or hurt himself. "
"To be completely honest you’re being really rational and he’s just using emotion on this one, you’re 100% right you don’t know her and pretty  much neither does it since you two will truly never know what happened with her in those 7 years. Although it is a 50/50 chance she’s actually good or not, I would say you should give in for a bit but at the same time if you give in and she stays there is basically no way out especially is she starts acting a little crazy he will be the first one to defend her. What if you guys make a compromise and pay for an apartment or something in the meantime while she’s tries to get back on her feet."
Filing under “wholesome pranks ideas.” 😄
I’m also a little worried about him sending pornography to a different female cousin. Is it a stretch to think someone might be grooming him?
You can't remove yourself from every undesirable situation. That's not how life works. That isn't coping with things.
"Your husband may not be a neglectful father, but nor is he a good one. Even if your daughter doesn't have great grades or doesn't brush her hair for dinner that is zero reason for him to dislike her or not love her. 

Your husband should see a therapist about his feelings towards his daughter, because it's not normal. Your daughter deserves to have a loving father, but at the very least a father figure who accepts her. A father who doesn't show affection and views her as a failure will definitely have a long term detrimental impact on her development and psyche.

Uou need to focus on the best mum you can be, and I think you already realise that this situation really isn't right. You may have to make some difficult decisions soon to make sure your daughter has the support she deserves (...I honestly don't think I could stay with a man who felt that way about his child). For now, stand by your daughter and encourage your husband towards therapy. "
"Telling you he was coming, delaying for three hours, ignoring your texts, and then bailing...is not cool. Had he alerted you that he wouldn't be leaving for three hours and then bailed due to traffic, fine. But he basically told you with his actions that he doesn't respect your time or find it valuable.

The silent treatment is not a way to handle relationship problems. It's equally as bad as what he did. You need to address this in a mature, adult way directly.

""What you did on Sunday, telling me you were coming, then waiting a long time to tell me you weren't actually coming, wasted my time and made me feel as if you do not respect my time."""
Why have you never initiated sex in your entire relationship? Both people should play a part and it becomes exhausting always being that one. 
Call your local internet companies and ask.
"I'm not sure I could call that abuse so much as a forgetful/lack of respect person. We have multiple cats and there's only so many people I trust to enter and exit the house without my family present. I could care less about my stuff, but my cats will start looking outside if the door is left open even a second and they're fast little PIAs. I'd be concerned OP's niece wouldn't follow the rules of the house, and thus also the rules of the door. "
But he's using all his money that he earns for fun things while she's using the money she earns to support them. It's totally justified that she's still upset at this. 
"OP, those are bad reasons to stay with someone. The question you need to answer for yourself is, do you want a chance to spend the rest of your life with this woman? If the answer is yes, accept that you may never get a chance to explore (which really isn't that great tbh, the single life can really suck at times). Otherwise, if your priority is to live the single life, then accept that you aren't going to have this woman in your life and end things. "
"Yeah, it’s not legal anywhere in the western world for an adult to send a child sexually explicit pictures. The age of consent may be legal, but that doesn’t cover sexual pictures. 


This guy is a predator. Regardless of whether or not you can legally consent, you are not emotionally mature enough to have a relationship with this dumpster fire of a man. "
"I was also wondering this. It may not be directly related to the OPs question, but members of a minority group are always going to notice when someone is potentially being derogatory towards us and it is always relevant to correct that if/when it happens."
When people say that only women eat “rabbit food” and “real men” need to eat meat... I don’t understand how people are sexist about being healthy and eating your fruits and veggies. 
"&gt; Your clothing is causing an issue with your peers.  They haven't complained, but I have noticed a negative change in their productivity.

This is unacceptable. Dude cannot, and should not, hold this woman responsible for the actions of men. If individual men are being unproductive that is their own performance issue and he should be speaking to them."
You have to disclose to her to get a checkup and tell her you did not know before treatment and roll with the punches. Hopefully she will understand.
Your boyfriend raped you. You shouldn't get over it. You should dump him and you should report him to the police for rape.
"I mean, neither are ideal outcomes but one is a lot easier to deal with that the other."
"What's the big deal about being hungover? It just makes you a little sluggish in the morning. I'm usually feeling better by noon. 

Unless your anniversary plans are to run a marathon I don't think it'll be an issue. Also I'd recommend not making a big deal out of your gf going out drinking with her friends. My ex doing the same when I was 19-21 made me feel smothered and like I'd be better off doing my own thing."
"I second this 100%. I'm 23m, I where clinical depressed and lived at my parents for some time then. It sure kept me alive they could cook me food, otherwise I would have straved to death 100%.
You need to get her to see a therapist and doctor on a weekly basis.
Everything else you do will be highly appriciated  and make a huge diffrence in her well being. 
Good luck!"

"Yeah but for all we know the daughter was decent at a sport but since she wasn’t great the father destroyed her interest in continuing. 

I mean I agree. I sucked at soccer but still played for 10 years as it was fun.  It I was encouraged by my parents because they saw I liked it. My dad even became a coach to help out. "
You are part of the problem. 
"I find it odd that you're asking people ""how to persuade her."" She's a person, she has the right to weigh her options and the costs and benefits of moving in the same way that you do. There isn't a magic sequence of words you can say that will override the things that are important in her life.

You have told her that you want her to move with you. If you haven't already, it might be a good idea to tell her where you see the relationship going. You've been together for a few years (sounds like you likely got together in college?) - is marriage on the table, or is that still a long way off for you? If her reason for not moving is that she doesn't want to uproot her life for an uncertain relationship, maybe you need to talk about where your relationship is.

If she doesn't move, you do and neither of you is ready to break up, long-distance relationships are a thing, but when you're a plane ride away and you don't have a timeline on any plans to move back to the same city, that just seems like dragging out the inevitable IMO. Maybe it's time for you both to move on."
"So your wife is aware that you used to be FWBs with her sister? That just affects how I view this. Assuming that she does know about your past with her sister, then she should be a good source of advice. Just be careful, you don't want to pit the sister against each other. Obviously Christine has some issues to work though, and you probably can't help her deal with those. Whether this means that she needs therapy, or time away from you, she needs to deal with this. If all of my assumption have been correct, then I'm going to assume that your wife trusts you a lot. That is good. Make sure you communicate all of this with her. You do NOT want to get caught in-between them."
[deleted]
Could be just regular orgies who knows whom else they invite once he's gone
"Take this as permission to snoop through his computer/phone and delete any photos or videos of yourself. He is not in the least trustworthy. Maybe even reach out to his exs and see if they really did. If they didn't, do them a solid and delete those as well."
"You made the right choice, he was ghosting you and your friends suck on the advice giving. "
"Yes, her mom's side of the family is very wealthy and her mom is a successful businesswoman and pays for all her college tuition. She told me she has had problems with her mom her whole life (she was very critical of her, verbally abusive and caused her to have low self-esteem). Her mom used to criticize her for her weight, her tan skin, and not being ""smart enough."" But now that she made it to the school we are at and lost weight, she is closer with her mom and doesn't want to ruin the relationship since she has sought out her mother's approval her whole life. She only has one brother but isn't close with her father and has no other family, so having that sense of family is important to her. She is in a tough predicament. 

Thank you for your advice though. I will have a heart-to-heart conversation with her, because if we continue to hookup I will fall deeper and deeper into my feelings for her and it will hurt me to go our separate ways. "
"This is the sort of thing that you share with your boss.

Joanne should know better than to tell people she is thinking of leaving. The repercussions for doing so are on her."
"I'm so sorry that this happened to you, and I hope there's a silver lining in being outcast from a family with such abhorrent moral standards, although I'm sure it's painful!"
"That looks absolutely terrible.  I'm sorry OP.

My brother regularly wears a ""normal"" mohawk and when it was time for my wedding he offered on his own to shave it for the pictures.  I hope your husband comes to his senses."
"I think people would be a little more sympathetic if OP’s husband had a haircut that he genuinely thought looked good and was done purely out of self expression. But this style is the result of a bet and it’s intention is to be ridiculous and embarrassing. Wearing it to a wedding would be distracting and draw focus away from the couple and their family. 

It’s almost like showing up to a wedding in a Chuck E Cheese suit. Maybe you’re just trying to make others laugh but it’s not an appropriate venue to draw a ton of attention to yourself. "
"Thanks for the clarification.  Honestly, it sounds like she has nothing to do except read stupid celebrity gossip (because that's what the internet is becoming).  After 2 months of maternity leave, I couldn't wait to go back to work.  It gave me something to do, something I was good at, and something I enjoy.

I'm sorry for her, and for you, for it reaching this point.  I hope she can find something that inspires her again."
"Get a dildo. Don't blow your best friend.

Chances are, you already have feelings, and you're just not admitting to them right now out of fear that he would reject you. You don't just randomly decide you want to blow your best friend, and trust me when I say that this (edit: by ""this"" I mean ""approaching your best friend for sexytimes but not romance"") will not end well."
"Why would she be dead in a ditch somewhere? 

This is a ridiculous conclusion you’ve jumped to because you’re negative and judgmental. 

Mind your own business. "
"Not for nothign your husband is a jerk in the situation as well.  If my college friend acted in that manner, I would say ""dude you need to calm down with the talking""  Second night, ""dude uber is on the way to take you to a hotel, good to see you"""
"This is the problem.  They've had discussions about prioritizing the mortgage and saving for kids, but he doesn't seem to be contributing to those goals - she has to sacrifice her money for things they both apparently want to prioritize.  Now all of a sudden he's picking up extra gigs to save for his fun activities - I get why she feels resentful.  In her mind, why wasn't he going the extra mile to help them meet their goals before?

It feels like he's only giving her lipservice about prioritizing mortgage and family but won't put his own money where his mouth is.  He's saying one thing and clearly doing another by prioritizing fun money.  "
"She didn't just cheat, she moved in with the new guy. Grass wasn't greener and now she realises she fucked up big time. Don't take her back, work on yourself and find someone who appreciates you without needing to cheat to confirm it."
That’s not passive aggressive. That’s documenting a direction. 
"Honestly I think it was a mistake and super awkward that you did this on a vacation with your parents. Especially since you said your parents are somewhat conservative, it makes it really uncomfortable to them and to you. Fuck I get uncomfortable around my conservative parents when people kiss during movies, I can't imagine why you would think this was a good idea. To add to that, going on a date with a local while you're on vacation is always slightly dangerous, and your parents were probably also worried about your decision-making abilities and possibly even your safety. Keep the casual dates/sex to when you're with friends, and always make sure someone knows where you are."
"Oh nooooo, 100 is way too many girls to ask out in 1 university, seriously a LOT of those girls probably know each other.  When you said this:

&gt;the entire spectrum of girls I'm interested in (really just any girl who takes care of herself)

I feel pretty certain these girls perceive you go for ""anyone with trait X"" and that they are so interchangeable, like any of them would do. That is sooooooo so so so not attractive. I feel pretty certain that the majority of girls you've hit on have seen you hit on plenty of others just the same way, as if it doesn't matter who they are, just that they are fit. NOOOOO.

100 is too many in one university, small town, social group, or industry. It just is. I saw you said below how you broke down how it really isn't too many BUT IT REALLY IS, within one environment like that.

Your entire post comes off as DESPERATION. And, trust me, I get it. I have felt absolutely desperate to find a relationship MANY a time. And I truly feel for you in how you feel suicidal. I've been there as well. But the desperation is not doing you any favors.

I think you need to just chill for a while and stop blazing through all the girls you meet. I know you are worried about taking advantage of your ""biological prime"" but honestly 21 is very far from the peak age of attractiveness to women. I don't think most women would say 21 is the most attractive age. You should have at least a decade's worth of very attractive years ahead.

I honestly think you should fish in a different pond if you feel you must keep asking girls out, but DO NOT do it at this rate, and try not to give off the vibe of, ""anyone fit will do.""

You mentioned a racial aspect going on here, that you are Southeast Asian. Are the girls you are asking out also Southeast Asian because there might be some racism in play here unfortunately. 

I know you've done a lot to improve yourself and I don't want to pile something else on because I really don't think the problem is other people are more ""developed"" than you. I don't think that's it. But if I were to suggest something.... I noticed you put a lot of effort into self-development, making sure your own self is improved, etc. etc. But there is really not a lot about forming genuine connections with other people. Even though that is actually what you are looking for. Like you can be the funny guy at the party, but  honestly I'm not sure how much romantic attention that will draw because I don't see that leading to a mutual connection with someone else. Other people want to be seen and noticed and appreciated and seen as special and individual. And that's not something I really think you should ""practice"" or power-level at and read inspirational books about. Because it really has to be organic, special, genuine. It's not something that can be done properly with 100 people in a short time. 

Edit: I just saw how you shot this down when somebody else said it above. I understand that you tried forming connections with people and those didn't lead to a romantic relationship. But I don't think that means it's wrong. I think it's just going to take some time, and I do NOT think power-leveling through it will pan out regardless of what's claimed online. That's because IRL, with basically everyone I know, it took time for them. There's a perception that this stuff should happen quickly for us if we do the right stuff, but I think it takes time for the majority of people no matter what we do."
Seriously. Your husband's friend sucks but you couldn't go three days without making a huge scene because of some annoying conversations?
"Maybe chat about what your care taking expectations are with specific behaviors (I.e getting me soup, staying when I’m sick etc). 

I have chronic conditions and my partner was total shit at care taking when we first moved in. After a chat we realized it was because he had no idea what to do for someone who is sick because he was never in that situation, so it became a blind spot. We talked about what my needs are and what I do when he is sick- and honestly he’s been amazing since. It wasn’t a lack of care just him not really getting what being in my body was like and that he could help. That took a lot of me figuring out how to communicate my needs esp when sick (when it’s extra hard!). Talking about it and making plans when not sick helps 

I feel like people here might say he’s just a jerk but maybe not? It sounds like he’s worth the benefit of the doubt based on how you feel about him "
It is over between you. The time to have fixed it was when you brought her to meet the family. All of you should have shut grandma down. Instead you all passively accepted her racist views. If your girlfriend had not understood there would not be a problem. I can't say I blame her. Lesson you should learn.
"This doesn't make sense.......they dated 3 months, 12 years ago, when they were 16 and she's still carrying a huge amount of venom towards your BF?   She is either completely bat shit crazy or something happened with BF that is causing this hatred so long after the relationship.  It makes no sense that the couple getting married would let her influence who the best man is going to be.  I'd be tempted to try to get her, BF and you to hash this out sometime.  Not at the wedding!   But something doesn't add up. "
Let your boyfriend go! Let him find love and be with someone who respects him. Staying with him while you harbor feelings for another person is incredibly selfish... possibly even more hurtful than the initial cheating 
"I don't know about you, but when I'm in the zone I significantly prefer emailing over conversations. 1: I can remember I've done it. 2: I can see exactly what was said. 3: I don't get distracted and forget what else I was doing. "
Y’all are absolutely not dating. Why do you keep saying that?? 
"Pay attention to this OP, because this is how normal people act. If I were sitting around a fire chatting with people and my girlfriend said she was going to bed, I'd get up and kiss her goodnight but wouldn't assume she expected me to call it a night just because she was. If she wanted you to come to bed with her then she should've asked, and also been prepared for you to say that you were going to stay up and talk a while longer. "
"If your thoughts and actions don’t make you creepy, what does? "
"""He's doing all this gig economy stuff to help offset the cost of his fun trips. I do think he'll be able to make enough this summer to offset those costs"" That's what he is doing..."

"My husband spent 8 years in grad school and went into industry, not academia, after getting his PhD. He also made a decent stipend, especially because we live in an area with low CoL.

He recent passed his 1-year anniversary at the company and got a raise. The *raise* is a full two thirds of what his *annual stipend* was his last year of grad school. We've been able to knock out most student loan debt and start a family. It feels amazing.

I don't know what field your SO is in, but you should look into salaries for others in his position. (It doesn't even have to be in the same field; my husband studied physics but now he works in data analytics.) He may not realize how much $ he's giving up. A six-figure salary looks pretty great after having driven for Lyft, even if he puts his other plans on hold for a few years. They will always be there.

Edit, maybe most important thing of all: **you supported him during grad school.** Maybe his stipend was decent, but would he have been able to keep that standard of living if you had not had a good job? You worked to support him so that you guys could be financially responsible and now it's time for him to do the same for a while."
"It seems good on the surface of things, but make sure you re-examine this agreement a short ways down the road.  The whole arrangement is predicated on the assumption that your wife will want to be around the family more once she gets to do a few of ""her"" things.  That may not be the case, so stay vigilant. "
"Emily seems the type of person to deny she's done any wrong even if she's told outright what she did, though. I doubt a note will impact her any more.

Edit: misinterpreted your comment lol. Completely changed what I said."
"But...if the kids take his name and he keeps his name, what does SHE get? Right?

""His masculinity"" is a terrible reason for pretty much anything, IMO.

If she and the kids have her name, and he has his, he's still kept more of his own identity than 95%+ of women throughout history. 

(Sorry, I seem to have stumbled onto a soapbox here)"
Leave. Find help and leave immediately. 
"This. At the very least he should be working for a company in his field and gaining the contacts/building a portfolio there. If he's that fresh out of grad school, I'm sure he's got a lot to learn about the practical application of all the stuff he studied. No need to spend $1000 to meet some people when he could do that at work if he worked at an established job - and get paid for it too. "
The fact that you have kept in touch and messaging with M while knowing how strong your feelings are for her and also while being in a relationship with K is horrible. 
"We realise that. The suggestion is that you ADD kid friendly local activities to your lineup. Of course they aren't the ones you would do if you were going out without her FFS. You don't have to leave town to have family time with her, just take her to the damn park together or something."
"I should've stated she works with these people about 70-80 hours a week (hospital work), so they're practically family. I felt I'd be seeing them often and would slowly build up some type of friendship/familiarity with them, not go all out on questions the first time we meet."
"&gt;I mean have you ever noticed how you feel when you've done nothing for a while and you have no schedule? 

I get that way after a long, stay-at-home weekend, so I can't even imagine how nuts it would be if it lasted indefinitely!

That's why, as great as ""we don't have to work ever"" sounds to me, I know even if I suddenly became extravagantly wealthy (\*snort\* unlikely) I would still need to keep *some* kind of job, even if it was a regular volunteer position, or part time work.. jus*t somethi*ng to keep from getting mired in the ""nothing matters, I don'*t ha*ve to do anything, what is my purpose"" that crops up."
Then you should know better.
How is it immature to want her kids to have her last name?
Its most likely since he was just speaking hypothetically and hasn't asked you to marry him yet. I don't think it reflects anything on the state of your relationship or if his desire to marry you. He is clearly in to you from what you described. 
You should. You have poor judgement. 
A suggestion: Email those pictures to the landlord immediately. That way she can’t claim OMG Photoshop! 
"Parenting classes might be more helpful honestly. You guys are focused on what you need. Where do your daughter's needs come in? She isn't even 2 yet, a camping trip once a month isn't what she needs. When you have kids, you have to give up a lot of the things you want, because this tiny little person needs you."
"Why are they sleeping over at your house at all?   And why are you married to this woman?   Why is she married at all?

You've let this go on for 2 years, which is 24 months too long.  Tell your wife that if they are not comfortable at *your* house, they can go somewhere else.  If she's afraid of disagreement, be disagreeable with her.  Tell you are no longer going to leave.  Do not Justify, Argue, Defend, or Explain your position.  Just tell her no and let her stress out all she has to about telling them that the rules have changed.

You might also consider why you are even married to this pre-teen in a woman's body.   Is this what the rest of your marriage is like too?"
There’s a secondary phone app you can install and get a second phone number. The second phone number can be changed anytime. Tell her to do that and never give out her own phone number for safety. 
He was not attracted to her on their wedding day.  HE should not have married her at all.
Women have been literally murdered for refusing to give out their number. 
"I can see that, possibly.

Maybe they're afraid to catch cooties?"
"Get some therapy my friend, your trust issues will really cripple your future happiness. It doesn't negate the hurt you've gone through, or make what the person who betrayed you did any less wrong, but don't let their infidelity poison the rest of your personal life like this."
"I think that's exactly what this guy is worried about. She's his first relationship and they met when he was 27/28, which is a lot later than most people. He's scared that he won't find someone after her."
"This is pretty clearly articulated, but may not be received well by your mom."
"My point of view is that she can't ever be trusted.  She has proven it and her behavior is sketchy, too.

If she was dating ethically her husband would know.  Instead you are a secret.  She's lying to him, too.  
So she's cheating on him.  Why do you think she won't cheat on you, too?"
"No problem, you seem like a great dad"
"No, don't pay it. $10 is a bigger deal for you with your current budget, so everyone saying ""It's just $10"" arent coming at it from a college budget perspective.

Also you said it perfectly and that's exactly what I'd say to her:

&gt; I paid her half the appropriate amount for utilities as soon as she asked.

That's it. She's eaten you out of $10 with her eating your food all the time, she's clearly a moocher. You firmly tell her you were on time with your payment and won't split the late fee she earned herself. You also know she wouldn't split a late fee if roles were reversed, she's just seeing if she can pester it out of you and push you around.

And if she keeps up, you just say ""no"" and keep repeating as needed."
Can you share some examples? Cause it smells like bullshit to me.
"Because it annoyed you enough to use it as a point in your post. And it’s something pretty minor to point out. I remodeled my bathroom before I started dating my partner. I had a boyfriend at the time but it was designed for a single lady. I have a double towel rack bc I use two towels. When he moved in he mentioned that I use both towel racks and uh... We went to a home improvement store and got a single towel bar from the same collection I already have and mounted it. It took maybe an hour. 

It’s a wonder what speaking up the first time something bothers you and finding a solution together can accomplish "
"I grew up in the states, and my brother would definitely let me lay in his bed and cuddle if I was sad. In fact, we used to lay on his or my bed and chat about random crap all the time when we lived together, and we are both in our mid 20s. But hey, I also cuddle with my Mom when we watch tv, and my childhood best friend when I see her, so who knows. Maybe we are weird, but I don't think physical affection always has to have a sexual implication."
So we're just gonna gloss over the gun thing?
"I guess my question is this:

When you earned more, he didn't like it.

Now that you earn less, he uses it to put you down and treat you as lesser.

So, in this equation, how exactly do you come out okay in his eyes? How do you get him to treat you with respect and like you deserve what you have? 

I don't think there is a way."
"I mean, are you planning to have sex? Because if not, there isn't anything to be worried about. 

Given your guilty feelings, I think you're planning to have sex. Thing the first: no, your mother won't know just by looking at you. Screw that. Thing the second: sex is a beautiful thing, in general but most especially when shared by people who trust and respect each other. Your BF of 3 years is someone like that. There is nothing to feel guilty of, if you do the deed. Make sure you use protection. "
"Are your neighbors Westboro Baptist church members or something? How come your husband is okay with using a church as (presumably) free childcare but not your neighbors? I'm now thinking his problem is that he wants free childcare like your parents and perhaps he expects he can ask coworkers to help out with babysitting for cheaper than he can get the neighbors kids to do it. 

Also, if any childcare plans fall through, your husband will 100% expect you to be the one to miss work so he can be competitive in his field. "
"It's a social construct that women should not have any visible hair. It's not actually gross (in the unhygienic sense), since it's acceptable for men to not shave."

"&gt;he said it never came up. And honestly he didn’t think it matter.

Hahaha, dude is lying to himself and you with that line. The only possible way it “might not matter” is if the child had been put up for adoption and had zero part in his life. He is either in denial or lies because he knows it’s a huge dealbreaker for a lot of people. No, you are not being selfish for not wanting to raise someone else’s kid, especially since he hid this from you for 4 months."
"&gt; That was on Sunday. And since then she's been texting me how sad she is and how I could do this to her, and begging me to give her another chance (she was given more chances than she deserved).

Block her number. You broke up, you don't need to expose yourself to this (nor should you). 

&gt; I won't delete her off social media because her lack of attention from me will cause her to burst even more

This is stupid. Don't be stupid. She will get over this faster if you go no-contact. Instead, she know she's still receiving attention from you.

&gt; I'm a bit afraid of her coming to my house or damaging my car.

Why?

&gt; Should I delete her off social media and block her number? I've got a feeling if I do that she'll come to my house and yell, because as I said, she is lacking my attention.

You're creating a problem where none exists. If she shows up to your house and starts yelling, call the police."

It is a lesson that you learned. Now leave it behind and move on. You didn't do something terrible but you did cross a line. So don't do it again and find a better job. Move on!

"Two-pronged approach is your best bet here: 

1.  Start calling out GF every time she says/does something nasty. Even in group settings. Don’t be super dramatic about it, but when she says something shitty, respond with a flat, “Wow,” or, “that was rude” and then let the conversation move on. The point is not to set up a big, dramatic confrontation, but to make it obvious that SHE is the one making things awkward and uncomfortable with HER crappy behavior. This is going to feel SUPER FUCKING WEIRD and uncomfortable for you the first few times it happens. She might give you some push back. Do your best not to get flustered, practice your “raising your eyebrows in disbelief that another 30 year old adult would act like this” face in the mirror if you have to. Remember that you are not the one making things weird or uncomfortable, she is the one making things weird and uncomfortable with her shitty behavior. You are just turning the consequences of her actions back around so that she actually has to feel them. Like I said, this is going to be super uncomfortable the first few times for you, but building this skill is like strengthening  a muscle, and it will get easier every time you do it. 

2. Talk to your friend and let him know his GF’s behavior is driving you away. You say he’s your *best* friend, so he should care that his SO’s behavior is affecting his relationships. You can do it now since he’s upset about you not coming over, or you can wait till he’s cooled down a bit. I would suggest doing it in person when his GF isn’t around if at all possible. I would be sure you have concrete examples of her behavior (i.e. talk about how when all of you guys were traveling together she kept picking on you about a or b topic) rather than just a blanket “she’s mean” (even though that sounds true). Hopefully your friend will respect your feelings and hear you. 

Good luck! "
"No, it's not reasonable at all. This is who he is and the way he likes his house decorated. You can't start dating someone and then aim to change them."
"If you want an open relationship with J, then you are incompatible with T because he's not open to polyamory. "
"&gt; ""You're worthless"" ""You're such a failure"" ""Why did I ever marry you?"" ""I should just cheat on you"" You do this and I'm thinking of cheating on you, on and on. If her anxiety continues to build, she reaches something akin to an anxiety attack. Inconsolable, screaming like a bloody banshee, and physically lashing out, police getting called, you get the general idea. Sometimes she apologizes for her actions, typically with an excuse for why I deserved it, sometimes just the last part about deserving it.

You're done. Get the hell out, *now.*

This reminds me so much of my ex-wife it's scary. She ended up bouncing a cast iron frying pan off my head, knocking me out, and then calling me weak for it. While she was cheating on me.

It will escalate. Get out now. Today."
"&gt;How many times do I casually ask them to repeat themselves before I say “I’m so sorry, I have some auditory processing issues, it’s not you, it’s me, but could you say that one more time a little slower?”

You should say this the first time you ask a person to repeat themselves. It has the virtue of being true and avoids the appearance of you being inattentive."
"I think it also gets worse in nerd circles because a lot of nerds have had experiences with being bullied, excluded, or unaccepted in their formative years, so they feel very sensitively when it comes to potentially doing the same to someone else. For some people, kicking someone out of the group just *feels* like the bully thing to do, even if the reasons for cutting someone out are more than valid. 

To be perfectly crystal clear since apparently I've given the impression otherwise, I am not saying I personally would use this reasoning to allow a predator to remain in my friend group, I am saying this is a potential explanation for why it does happen. "
[deleted]
"Why assume she didn't care? That's jumping the gun just a bit here. She cleared her entire day up to 5pm, for something she wasn't told the details of. She could've easily assumed that being free from when she woke up to 5pm was ""keeping her day cleared.""

Also, we don't know how serious this practice is to her. If she's a legitimate athlete or has a legitimate hobby/club that has mandatory practice, she could be setting herself back missing it. I'd say it's not fair for a partner to expect you to do that even for an anniversary. And she could've assumed he wouldn't.

Also if his mom isn't the type to get invested in his relationship, she's not exactly a reliable source of info on it. Her son is upset, and she's obviously going to take his side regardless. But that doesn't mean she knows about the gfs side of the relationship that well. I know my parents never knew a lot about the people I dated or what they did."
She could just take the entire lockbox away. Also take away the allowance. Parents can be cruel. 
"&gt;  I thought it was implied

You admit that she has a tendency to blow things off, so you already know that you cannot make any assumptions in this relationship. It sounds like you planned this whole thing thinking (or even hoping) that she'd follow through to the end even though you already knew there was a good chance she wouldn't.

Your mam is onto something here. "
This is a fundamental incompatibility. I'm sorry but there is no getting past this. 
"Wow, just saw that post history. That is such a monumentally terrible idea. I feel terrible for the older kids who have to deal with all of this bullshit. "
"You absolutely should not have a baby just to please your MIL. It’s sad that she’s in this position, but it doesn’t give her the right to dictate your own path to motherhood. You are quite young, your present work is not conducive to family planning and as you say, your marriage and living conditions are probably not yet up to adding the stress, expense and hard work of a child. 

I would say to her, (and anyone else) “MIL, I want to be the best possible mother I can be. I want to give my baby the best start in life. And I know that right now, that isn’t going to be the case.” 

Also, what is your husband’s reaction to all this? Is he firmly on your side or is he more leaning towards MIL? Is he getting pressure from his mother or are you the only one getting it? Is he pressuring you? "
"&gt; but I also am impressed that you recognize the gross power dynamic that her step-brother has created/encouraged/taken advantage of/etc.

To be honest, this is the worst part of the story for me. The step-brother is a nutjob, it honestly sounds like he's been grooming his step-sister since she was 15 to be his exclusive (on her end) side-chick. "
"There are two separate issues here:

1) You have a fundamental sexual incompatibility, where your needs aren’t being met, and you haven’t been able to reach a compromise. That needs to be addressed regardless of how this specific situation shakes out, whether that means finding a sex frequency that works for you both (could involve mutual masturbation, oral, etc), or ending the relationship and finding partners you *are* compatible with.

2) Your BF isn’t just looking at porn, he’s sexually fixating on a specific person who lives nearby. Looking at porn as a means to get yourself off is one thing; masturbating over a specific person’s social media - a person who lives in your immediate vicinity - is something else entirely. In your shoes, I would make this a dealbreaker (he either stops jerking it to this woman, or you’re done)."
"- You spend inordinate amounts of time with this woman (it reads like you might be seeing the other woman more than your own girlfriend, and sharing all your weekends and vacations with her)

- You sleep in the same room/tent as this woman

- This woman and your girlfriend don’t get along

- You share a pretty serious passion with this woman that you don’t with your girlfriend

- You spend weeks at a time alone with this woman on trips

- There is sexual tension between you and this woman

None of this is okay. This is exactly how affairs start, if you two aren’t already moving towards one. Your girlfriend has every right to be upset about your relationship with the other woman. You’re lucky she’s been as understanding as she has - many women would have long since left you. Definitely find another climbing partner and back off of the woman."
"She's with you now, and you should comfort her when she is sad."
"That, and all the misogyny and lack of personal responsibility over situations attached too... There's a lot of 'not my problem' and 'not my fault' and 'he wouldn't do that' and a good number of 'she was asking for it/dressing too sexy/looks old enough/has makeup/insert other things about women that shitty people attach to teenagers/young kids'. You see it all the time in nerd circles. It's constantly one of those things that gets rug swept until the police get involved and suddenly you hear a million excuses from every single person that knew and didn't care."
"Then wouldn’t he have booked those 2 one way flights? He hasn’t booked a return flight at all. I'm not saying no one ever books 2 one way flights at the same time, I'm saying it's very strange to book a single, one way flight if you have concrete plans of returning.

He’s keeping his return date open-ended on this trip that he is obviously taking to hook up with this woman."

"So let me get this straight.  She wants you to provide most of the money and do most of the work, and if life isn't full of pixie dust you should just do what she says and move back to where life was easier on her even though you're happy and she still isn't?

She doesn't want to make an effort because she does't care about your happiness.  It's optional for her; as long as *she* is happy you don't count (but if she is unhappy, well, again you don't count).  She's never going to make an effort as long as you keep facilitating her behavior.

This woman will ruin your life over and over again if hers doesn't go perfectly, which it never will because having a perfect life takes a lot of work."

"Honestly? I think it's perfectly normal and that it will pass. You're already doing all the right things, and pretty soon your heart will catch up to your actions. I can totally see how this would be difficult, no matter how much you love your sister, it's just human. Acknowledge the feeling, and then let it go.

"To figure out whether we can have a healthy relationship. After a number of issues I was ready for walking out. He said he'd speak to a counsellor, he knew he had issues etc - I gave him the option of a separation or a trial separation. So the goal is to figure out whether we want to be married."

It sounds like you both are drifting away and becoming incompatible as partners as you are starting to discover yourself in a new place while she hasn't shown any growth. Do you really want to go back to a rural area with her? She's not gonna change. She sounds dead set in her ways. I might suggest a separation or divorce.

"i think people are sugarcoating things by telling you that ""leagues don't exist"" and other silly platitudes. you have to tackle this issue from both sides: it's always good to continually improve yourself, and this will help you both to 1. stay in his league 2. feel like you belong there. you also need to address insecurities that are doing you more harm than good. you guys are quite young and have not been together that long, i think it would be deceptive to tell you that there's no chance that he feels like he wants to be with someone who more closely matches the person that he's working toward becoming."
"That would drive me crazy. I used to be that way when I was young, but it was entirely because I had ADHD that made it impossible for me to get my shit together. 

The trick is to just set a routine and stick to it. Your free time cannot be all fun and games and relaxing, at least 60% of the time you spend not working should be spent on maintaining your body/living space and then actively working to improve it. You have to make an effort. If you do the laundry on the same day every week, you won't run out of clothing. ""Random"" and ""haphazard"" sounds like a failure to have your shit together

All of this has nothing to do with your husband being cruel by the way, if he can't communicate with you about his expectations of labor division and just defaults to belittling you, it's not a relationship worth saving

So, get your shit together. Maybe get it together away from that guy, but get it together."

"&gt; Matt pretty much moved in with me to my student house to avoid spending time at the apartment he was still sharing with his ex.

It sounds like he continued to have access to the apartment. He just wanted to avoid being there.

I’m with you that OP is really working to interpret everything in a way that makes boyfriend look good, and ex look bad.

Like, why was he surprised that the cat was in the apartment? Did he just assume that she would take “their” cat?"
Thats a heart wrenching but hopeful story
"You can’t manage school and work because you’re also parenting two kids right now.  That’s a nearly impossible task for anyone.  Your labor has value, but it’s being paid at room and board levels right now.  Try to find a nanny who’ll mind two kids full time for room and board, lol.  You’ll get laughed out of the room (I’m assuming your not-husband isn’t paying for your school or splitting his finances 50/50 with you...if he is, then that might change the calculus somewhat).

If it’s going to be a few more years of school, I know it sucks but you can’t just spend the next three years praying that he won’t walk away.  I’m assuming if he leaves, you could still live above your dad - calculate the budget you’d need to support yourself (including estimated child support - plenty of calculators online).  I’ll bet, if you have cheap rent already through a family member, you might not need much to survive.  Find a part-time job that will pay you roughly that amount, and save every penny you can.  Don’t be shy about asking for your not-husband to step in and provide care while you do this.  He’s made it clear he doesn’t want to get married, so you can make it equally clear that his decision isn’t consequence-free.  You’ve been making this too easy on him, and how’s the time for him to wake up to the value of what you provide to your family.  It will be hard, I know...but not nearly as hard as it’ll be to manage two kids and school if he decides to just pull up and walk out."
"With the way his sisters are also acting, I have a suspicion she does not. "
"&gt; I just requested to follow her profile, like adding someone on Facebook but arguably less personal.

Nope.  That is fine to do if it's a friend of yours but this girl does not like you, and for a very understandable reason.  You should back off.  And your boyfriend sounds like an utter piece of shit.  Seriously, pathetic.  How low does your self esteem need to be to take someone like this as a life partner? I know you can't see all of that right now since you are in love and all that...but this guy is a scumbag.  You'll see that once the new wears off.  He neglected his animal, let his apartment go to squalor, moved in with you on a the second date, started dating while still living with his ex, kept his ex in his life for a year after they supposedly had a bad breakup, doesn't want you to meet his family, etc....do I need to keep going?  Jesus Christ.  This guy is a loser.  "

"You need to give her time. She needs to adjust her mind to the reality of what she went through, and how life changing it is for a women to lose a part of you that is innately what makes you feel like a woman. 

Remind her that you still find her attractive and wanted. Maybe start with going on dates again, and take things slow. Post surgery depression is a very real thing and more common than not(google it and do some reading on the topic so it can better understand where she is mentally). I experienced it myself after cosmetic surgery to fix scars from birth, and I still struggle with how I feel about my body 18 years later. I hope I helped in some small way!

"OP, please listen to this! It is seriously better to be alone and wait for the right friends and partners to come along than to rely on people who betray you."
"Please talk to her about getting an X-ray just to make sure there won't be future complications. 

Promise her (and I'm serious about this, OP) that you **won't** tell the doctors how it happened, and stick to that. 

Even if she doesn't tell them how the injury occurred, having it checked and documented with a doctor visit will be important if she decides to press charges in the future, or even just create a paper trail in case this guy hurts her again."

"Thank you for your advice. Having those letters for her is a very good idea. 

I do think she must have some personality disorder, and something must’ve happened to her that she kept secret. 

A few months back, I was scrolling on Instagram. There was an image from “narcissistic personality abuse” or something, account. It was like I was reading what was happening to me. I clicked follow, and I swear they were just writing about my life. I’d never heard of this (I’ll edit when I look it up now) but when I started researching it, it mentioned she more than likely was abused. That’s why even though I hate what she’s done, and doing, I don’t hate her. I could never imagine intentionally hurting someone. So for her to do this, she must really feel empty and hurt inside. 

I’m just terrified that if she could do this to a fully grown man, what she might do to my daughter if she’s the only one around. "
"Some of what you have written rings uncannily close to my own experiences.

I have a 22-year-old stepson who is on the spectrum, and we had a number of problems similar to the ones you describe, though not exactly the same (and for the most part not nearly as extreme as you describe).  He attacked me in my own home once because he was angry at having been told to clean his room, and he once attacked a teacher at school with a chair; I do not believe these were Spectrum-related, but rather related to his additional anger-management issues.

We eventually had to throw him out of the house because he was getting more and more violent and oppositional and dishonest...he went and lived with his dad for a while, and then ended up on the street for a while because he wouldn't live by his dad's rules, either.

In any event, what has proven *very* helpful to my stepson is: military service.  A recruiter found him in a facility for homeless young men, and he enlisted in the United States Army about a year and a half ago.  The challenge that he faced in the ""normal"" (by which I mean, outside-the-military) world was insufficient structure; there were too many options, too many opportunities to make bad choices, no matter what his mom and I tried.

In the military, especially in Boot Camp and AIT, his choices were *very* limited, and the rules and consequences were very concrete; far more concrete than his mom and I were ever able to make work.

That might be something for your brother to look into.  But it will only help him if he *wants* it to help him...there's *nothing* that can help him if he does not want help.

Good luck."
Honestly what it sounds like to me is when a parent gives a kid $20 bucks to buy some necessity like a new bottle of shampoo and then finds out they spent it on candy or a toy... The reasoning being that they no longer have money for said shampoo because they spent it on something else. Your friend is acting as if you don't have the funds to afford gas without her $10.
"Man I used to have this arguement with my ex CONSTANTLY.  It really seems like a simple concept but she couldn't understand it. Our rent was 1,200 a month of which she paid 300 per month. GOD forbid I simply pay the whole 1,200$ out my account and then use the 300$ she usually gave me as cash to carry around. It was a huge fight. I would be feel like head was explode screaming ""PLEASE TELL ME WHY I WOULD PUT YOUR 300 IN MY ACCOUNT JUST TO TAKE OUT THE SAME AMOUNT FOR CASH TO CARRY! WHATS THE DIFFERENCE?""Jesus I'm having flashbacks now. "
You should be ashamed.  Your boyfriend doesn't deserve to be cheated on. You should tell him before he finds out from someone else.

Book-alanches are surprisingly painful."

"Depends on the work.  
I'm a programmer, a friend/family member wants me to help them add a new hard drive to their computer? Install some new software? Or maybe even troubleshoot some software, no problem, I'll do all of that for free (troubleshooting software the first time only though). But if they want help building a website for their hobby or whatever, then it's full rate I'm afraid.

A lot of other work isn't like that.

Jesus Christ. Living with your boyfriend is not a necessity at all.

"Well, he's quite controlling, isn't he? You've been isolated and had social anxiety and now he wants to prevent you having a kind and warm reputation with your colleagues. These are warning signs.

He's your husband, not your parent, he doesn't get to tell you what you can and can't do with your free time. 

Tell your husband no. You are an adult, it is your decision and he doesn't get to make that choice for you or tell you what to do. If he doesn't like it, and he can't trust you, then you don't need to be in a relationship which is controlling with a man who has no respect or trust for you."
"You make 75k to her 36k, who in their right mind would make someone split it. Split it on income or make her pay a nominal amount just so that she isn't being or feels like a freeloader. And since it's the parents charging you a very small amount I might cut it down even less. I assume you talk to her about this, but I might cover all the rent and have her pay cable, netflix, water/heat or some of the other lesser bills."

"Well, honestly, the first time I was raped. I had told the guy I wasn't ready, he decided he wanted it anyway. 

I've had a single one-night stand, and I'm not made for that. I can't do physical intimacy outside of a relationship. I want to connect emotionally with the person that I'm going to be with for a long time.

Life is not a race. You need to stop comparing yourself to everyone else. You'll find someone, but it's going to be on your own time. Rushing into something won't help you.

I know it sounds difficult, but it will suck more if you regret your first time because you thought you just had to get it over with."
"&gt;The only thing that I can think of was that the doctor was also Indian, and a conservative seeming Christian one at the that, who shamed me for having premarital sex, so this obvious mistake was ideologically motivated, perhaps even by suggestion from my mom. 

Or.... the doctor just made a mistake when reading the results and circled the wrong value? I don't think I would risk my medical license to lie to every kid having premarital sex, or that I would go into medicine if I had such strong views about premarital sex that I couldn't care properly for any patient who engaged in it. That would be practically every patient. Occam's razor dude, maybe she just made a mistake. "

I also wanted to mention that it’s up to your dad and his wife to handle the expectations of her kids. They may be expecting a step sibling but you’re older and not close by. And your dad and his wife should be explaining that instead of passing on the message to you. But clearly wife isn’t going to do this PLUS they’re probably feeding off of her yacking about you behind your back. Just wanted to point out they’re not the ones in the wrong here. I’d just keep being polite."

The tiny house can wait. Use that money to find a place to live, get a job so you can maintain that place to live, and move out. Otherwise, you're paying rent via...this.

And don't think that this is just normal teenager behavior and you need to ""turn the other cheek"" and be friendly because she'll grow out of it. This isn't normal. You need to disentangle your life from hers; only spend time together when you have to, avoid her, don't tell her about your life, and certainly don't give her ammo to use against you. She can earn back your trust if she ever changes her attitude."
"It could be because of any number of reasons:

1. Maybe talking with him caused her to realize that you are a real catch, so she decided to make it clear that she realizes it

2. Maybe he made a pass at her, and despite her having no interest in him, she feels weird about it and so is overcompensating so that she can be clear to you that she's not into him

3. Maybe she actually had a twinge of attraction to him but wants to remain loyal to you, and so is doing this to be clear to *herself* that she's not into him.

4. Maybe she knows that some people who know you and her saw her there with him and is afraid that they will say something to you, and she is laying the groundwork to dispel any concerns that arise

5. Maybe she really *is* into him and is planning on leaving you, but isn't sure yet, so she's trying to keep you on the line until she decides

6. Maybe a friend of hers said to her that going out with him would *make* you feel insecure and advised her to step up her game so you would not

It could be any one of those, or something else entirely.  

She's the only person who knows."
"Lol I lived in CO for a while, where there's fierce winds and snowfall, and quite a few people parked their cars outside.

It seems like it, because you’re still dating your girlfriend. She hasn’t admitted wrongdoing. She hasn’t expressed regret. She thinks her behavior was OK.

You stopped this particular scenario by tattling, but you haven’t changed your girlfriend, your relationship, or the fact that you two have fundamentally different values.

I can’t imagine any scenario where I’d feel so strongly that I’d negatively impact my SOs career but also still date them!?!

"Yep. They still vote for anti-LGBT candidates, which means that the message they send you, OP, about how they accept you and your GF is completely out of line with what they really believe.  Like, as if you and your GF are the “exception” to their homophobic ways.

If they truly loved and accepted you, the would apologize to you for the hurt that they caused you, they would acknowledge that their backwards views were harmful to you, and they would refrain from continuing to vote for candidates that campaign to vilify you and take away your rights.  They are effectively two-faced, expressing support to your face but stabbing you in the back in the same breath.

It’s completely ok for you to back away from a close relationship with them.  It’s completely ok to protect yourself.  I think some counseling for you, with a pro-LGBT professional therapist, might be able to help you reconcile this two-faced image of your parents.  They are straight-up lying to you when they say they’ve always supported you, and they are also lying to themselves that they accept you and your GF and yet continue to vote for politicians that vilify you. 

They can’t have it both ways.  I’m sorry you’re going through this. 🙁"

If he's not willing to introduce you and he's had other girlfriends in the past with issues about your friendship, it sounds like this is a choice he's making. If I had to make a guess it's because 1, his girlfriend's concerns are not unfounded, or 2, he might be a little interested in you and doesn't want his girlfriend to pick up on it when you two are together."

"If I'd married my first boyfriend (met at 17, dumped me at 18), I would be stuck in an abusive relationship and/or dead.

If I'd married my second boyfriend (met at 19, dumped at 20), I would be stuck in an abusive relationship, cut off from my parents because they hated him, and would be living in isolation away from everything I know and love.

If I'd married my third boyfriend (met at 21, dumped at 22), I would probably have been happy, but turns out I was either the side chick the entire time or he cheated on me near the end of the relationship and got the other one pregnant. 

If I'd married my fourth boyfriend (met at 23, dumped at 23), I would be living in a disaster with probably a kid or two, and I don't want kids.

I'm now on my fifth relationship, with someone who's much more mature and holds a steady job, and who actively works with me on any problems that we have. I've learned a lot by dating young and thinking I was going to get married, but it always bothers me when I see people who get married young.

I had a friend get married at 19, and they were divorced just six months later because he lost his job and couldn't keep it in his pants while she was away at work. Fucked several girls in their apartment complex, and his ex-wife has spiraled into a horrible drug-induced lifestyle and I haven't seen her in years. "
"You already ruined the relationship with Sofia, that's over. You cheated on her so it's a little late for all this ""should I or should I not"" talk. That would have been appropriate before the affair...now it's too late, you made your choice. Do the right thing and tell Sofia. "

"That's what I mean by bean counting though.  ""You gave up your career for years, now I'm commuting for years, so we're equal on that front and you can't back down from me owning the garage completely."" is bitter bean counting.

I suggest the addition, which I think would still be a fair means to meet half way.  The carports here at my apartment complex are basically a tent, and what I think of when people say ""car ports"".  It's absolutely more than okay for us because we live in a desert, and shelter from UV is really all we need and we can just go get the car washed after the occasional dust storm.  It probably wouldn't be adequate if we lived out in the boonies of Colorado, at least not if we really cared about the appearance of the car.  After having no car port at all when we lived in MO, the roof is already stripped of paint so I really don't care that much, but if I bought a brand new car I would.

Anyway, if a car port isn't secure enough for her, I think it's fair to spend a little portion of the hundreds of thousands of dollars they saved on a mortgage living out there by adding onto the garage and making room.  If she says that isn't enough and still wants him out, I'd say she is not willing to meet him halfway and it's probably more than about just where to put her car."

"He's still friends with her fiance, though. If that's the excuse then there's no reason they should still be hanging out, at all."
"Hey. Most of the comments are in the same vain of call him on the bs and make it clear he needs to make a choice you or James. I know this can be really scary but you deserve the answer and a husband that loved you. Based on what you wrote I think you already knew what people would say. 

You are worth choosing. Even if you have to move out for a while to show you are serious about him making a choice. Talk to a lawyer first about moving out and claims to the house in a divorce. 

Good luck!"
Can’t I just study abroad then get a job there and apply for citizenship? The whole marriage idea is exhausting and I hate marriage now

"Mary Kay consultants are told to run draws where people can win a prize, but unlike a real draw, they pretend everyone who entered is a winner. The prize is a ""free facial,"" but what the ""winner"" doesn't realize is that there is no facial, they get to apply a dollop of moisturizer on their face themselves and sit through a high pressure sales pitch complete with guilt over how a real woman wouldn't work outside the home when she has kids. If you love your kids you should be selling MK. 

They get lists of names through David's Bridal and bridal fairs and then hound the people on that list, sending message after message, often which start with ""I got your name from a friend who said she thought you'd love the opportunity for free pampering,"" etc. 

They are taught a lot of dishonest tactics for selling. If they were just showing a catalogue and getting sales that people wanted, it wouldn't be so bad, but they lie and are taught to lie, and it's not good. That's why a lot of people don't respect them and hate the company."
"&gt; he says it's because I freak out about any woman now so he feels the need to lie

See, now I think this is a very valid reason for you to be curious/cautious about any woman he might be texting. What has he done since Angela to reassure you and regain your trust in him and the relationship? I wouldn't be surprised if you still felt this way (which is completely valid, btw) because he has yet to actually try and build the trust back up in the relationship. He has no reason to be sneaky or dodge questions about who he's texting if there is truly nothing going on. What I mean is that there is probably nothing going on from the waitress' side of things, but maybe he has a slight crush on her? Either way, he would be best to own up to his feelings and be open and honest with you, regardless of who was texting or what the situation was. I agree with other comments about the gaslighting and weird behavior. "
Aaaaaand that’s a troll.
"I mean, runners high is a rush and it also potentially extends your life. Finishing a NYT crossword puzzle is a rush and you can also do it while sitting in a chair on a lazy weekend afternoon. 

You don’t actually need someone to tell you that it’s BS and you deserve better, right? "
Yep while you are working hard and providing if you want this to stick you need some super quality time and then get her into therapy. This is me to a T when I'm in a depression spiral. 
"Well, I’d be more pissed at your boyfriend who didn’t shut down his mom’s comments."
Forgiveness isn’t something someone is owed for saying sorry. It’s something you attempt to earn by rectifying the issue. He made a series of obviously bad decisions that led to an obviously bad situation where cheating was obviously going to happen and then barely managed to salvage things. He’s not a good boyfriend and forgiveness should be slow in coming if at all.
"Pretty often. Not every single weekend, like a few times a month. I think having him come every few months and for a few hours would be a good compromise."
"Eww he's negging you. Red flag.

"""I've become attached"" ""I want her to breast feed"" ""I like, I want, I need"" 
Are you sure this is about her?

Also, depending on the type of surgery, women with breast implants can still breastfeed. However, if you are that attached to her breast as your own, you may end up having mixed or bad feelings towards her breastfeeding. 
Anyways, you should try to listen to her wants/needs and be honest about how you feel but you need to respect her decisions and be supportive. If she really wants it, she will get it done, with or without you. "
"Just want to say that I really agree with you OP. Finding someone attractive is of course natural, putting yourself in a position where you could easily cheat with said person is not okay. While I agree that this is something not unforgivable, he needs to be held accountable for his actions and it is a problem that he put himself in a position where he was alone with her for such an extended period of time that she felt comfortable to kiss him."

Case closed. "
"Don't be with someone who yells at you. Period. Even if he had legitimate concerns, he could discuss them sympathetically, have a conversation, you could both find solutions together. Him yelling at you shows that he's the problem, *even if* you've done anything ""wrong"". He's not interested in fixing issues, he just wants to wear you down. If you do have any issues that need work, either work on them away from him, or with someone else who builds you up and supports you through them, not who belittles you and makes you feel like everything's your fault.

"Homeschooling can be very good for the kids if done by a family who prioritizes an actual quality education. It's the people who home school as a control tactic that are an issue.

I was home schooled for just 8-12 and I got a good education.  The biggest ""problem"" that came out of it for me was that it allowed me to ignore some mental health issues that had been stewing for a very long time (breakdowns in 2nd and 4th grade, was on track for another in 8th) because change took some pressure off. But that was me not being willing to deal with my own shit,  like ya do as a teen.

On he other hand, I met some families who were REALLY out there. All the stereotypes are true of a small number of families. 

The biggest problem is finding a support group that isn't nuts.  Especially in high school, home school groups and coops are amazing but if they're 99% nutjobs, that's not helpful. 

It's also harder to find secular curriculum than Christian, especially for science.

You’re trying to become your best person and he’s getting distant. Some of what you wrote here needs to be said to him. I’m not saying you need to throw away your relationship. Four years is a long time, but you should  try to hear what his explanation is for why he’s acting the way he is.  If he can’t be honest and open about it, that means communication is shot and without it this future marriage wouldn’t work.

"I was not excited for my wedding. I didn’t want to do it really, it felt very obligatory, and I don’t much like being publicly mushy either. I didn’t want to wear white, I hated the veil, and I didn’t want to do a ceremony. Picking food and the registry and making 1000 stupid decisions was awful.

But if somebody talked about being married to my husband, it made me really happy. I would smile like an idiot because he’s the best. 

You don’t sound happy. Pump the breaks, you probably should do some soul searching about whether resignation is really a fair feeling to yourself and your fiancé. Would you want to marry somebody who was depressed and resigned to marrying you? Does that seem fair?

Make yourself happy. Dump the fiancé. Live your best life and let him live his best life too."
"Has he held up any sporks lately..?

Ah, I think what's happening here is a classic case of operant conditioning. It used to be a funny in-joke, but the orgasm has permanently altered the positive feedback loop between nonsense sounds and the kind of intense serotonin release associated with an orgasm. The only way to tackle this is through reversing the association pattern. Go to the supermarkets and buy some mini candy bars. Give him a mini candy bar every time he answers a question like a normal person, or can make it through intercourse without a wubba-lub-dub.

I'm joking. I have no idea what to do with your predicament, I'm sorry. But on the off-chance that this isn't a troll post, you have my condolences."
Thing is the fact that you want kids should come much sooner that 3 months point. What you want and your timeline about it mean that those are hard dealbreakers that should be evoked asap. Like first or second date talk. 
"Wait till Bella finds out her hairstylist doesn't use her $20 tip to buy more hair dye for next time.

"It \*is\* her right as an individual; it's also her choice to be with you and your feelings should count for something.

The way I see it, there are two ways you can approach this.

The soft approach is that you can think carefully about what the specific bits of this are that bother you. Is it not knowing where she is? Is it that she's disrupting your sleep? Is it the expense of how much she's drinking or that she's too hungover to have quality time with you? Is she getting stupid drunk and vomiting all weekend as a result? Once you've narrowed that down, think of specific solutions to each of those and ask her to do those things. If she's a reasonable, receptive person who's willing to see things from your point of view, she likely won't begrudge sending you a safety text or agreeing to let you know ahead of time when she'll be in. This removes the issue of being controlling because you're not asking her to stop, just to compromise. The  issue with this is that it does depend on her being a reasonable and receptive.

The hard approach is that you establish that whatever bit of the behaviour it is that bothers you cannot continue and explain your reasons behind it, for example, ""I'm losing out on sleep because I stay up worrying about you when I don't know where you are. If you keep staying out so late, then I'm not going to be able to continue our relationship."" This helps in terms of establishing a boundary, but you will then have to follow through on it."
"I had a roommate graduate behind me who sent me a text once when I had a Buddha statue in the apartment for a project.

She wasn't comfortable with it in the living room because, while she felt he was protecting the home, she didn't want to do something he would see as a sin and thus incur his wrath.

She also got a German Shepherd who was so much smarter than her, the neighbors thought we got two dogs: ""my"" dog heeled for walks, ""hers"" took her for a ride around the block.

About money specifically, her mother wrote checks to her for the rent, and she took these checks *written to her,* signed the backs, and put them in the apartment's dropbox.

But hey, she could get nearly straight A's. 

**TL;DR: A college education means nothing.**

Ask her what she would think if you had the ten she gave you, and another ten already in your pocket? Would she like to inspect the bills to ensure it wasn't *her* ten paying for a treat?

The entire point of giving someone gas money is so that the driver doesn't have to give up ice cream cones in favor of hauling someone else around.

Since comments locked, a response to the below:

&gt;Possibly the parent asked her to do this to prevent your roommate from spending the money on ice cream instead

I chuckled.

Unfortunately, I only know it was happening because of an eviction notice on our door. Landlord claimed to have never seen the checks. Her mother was the most disappointed in her as I've seen. She told me that ""I did it just like you told me to!"" which was never my suggestion (considering I never even considered your scenario an option). 

No telling what actually happened with the checks, whether the landlord himself pocketed them, or the sketchy neighbors liked to snoop through that box for just this kind of thing."
Ur not clarifying by saying all that. You’re writing a lot of mumbo jumbo to avoid outright stating what the truth is: she is cheating on her bf. Why are u so loyal and not willing to say anything bad about a girl who is a terrible person? who cares that u slept with her fwb? she doesn’t get to call dibs on him when they are not in an exclusive relationship. she’s a shitty person. who cares what she thinks?

"I’m glad most people are agreeing that this 25 year old is creepin on OP. I do agree, though, that your sister took it out of hand. We have to remember that she’s also only 20 and all she has known up to this point is caring for and raising OP. Tbh, her reaction is understandable but she needs to learn to handle future situations like that differently. You should talk to her once she’s calm, OP. 

Also, as long as your sister is taking care of you, you need to listen to her concerns even though you’re 18. When you’re no longer financially dependent on her and live on your own, you can date whoever you want, just be careful bc bringing back a 25 year old was not a smart decision either. "
"My mom has done this very same thing since I was a young teen. My mom acts like her preferences for how I dress are for my benefit (“you won’t be popular” or “how will you be a working professional” etc) but in actuality it’s more about what my mom just LIKES. It’s been a very contentious issue between us and has not fully resolved even though I’m in my mid 30s and have kids now. My theory is that my mom (and controlling somewhat narcissistic Mother’s), sees her daughter as an extension of herself and she wants to see her daughter dress how SHE would dress if she was youthful and had “that body” once again. 

Basically, in my moms mind, my body has always belonged to her and she will guilt trip and manipulate to try and get her way no matter what. It has definitely damaged our relationship. 

I have kids and will be extremely conscientious of this when raising them."

"OP, I'm so sorry this happened to you. It's amazing the shit people will do out of spite or jealousy or plain old boredom. When all's said and done, it does seem like BF's best friend had both motive and opportunity to do this, although like you said, knowing ""ex's"" name makes it a bit of a stretch. Still, the timing really makes it seem suspicious. Are you sure his friend is straight, or doesn't at least have feelings for him? Even if that feeling is extreme overprotectiveness, it can cause people to behave irrationally. 

If it wasn't best friend, my money would be on ""ex"" not being as over you as he seems. You said yourself he had feelings for you that you didn't return. Of course he would pretend to be shocked and appalled when you called him with news of what happened. If he's crazy enough to get someone to call your BF and lie, he's crazy enough to lie to you, as well. This is all just speculation, obviously. Normal people like yourself don't want to go around believing the worst of someone, but the simple fact is that someone did this, and that someone knows either you or your BF. It has to be one of the people in your lives, all of whom seem reasonable on the surface. 

If I were you, I'd make it clear to BF from now on (if you haven't already) that you won't accept blame for cheating when you didn't do it. Be open with him, be transparent, but don't apologize and don't grovel. You didn't do anything wrong. I don't have much advice, but hold your head high and trust in your own innocence. You have nothing to be sorry about. "
"That’s not love. 

Loving partners do not swear at or manipulate their partners during arguments — not only is it counterproductive to resolving the issues, it’s demeaning and harmful. It’s also a form of emotional abuse. Your boyfriend’s constant minimization of your feelings and claims that repeatedly calling you an “idiot” isn’t insulting are both huge red flags. You’ve already communicated to him that being sworn at really upsets you, yet he continues to do it. That shows that he does not respect your feelings or needs. Personally, I would leave if he continues to act like this and refuses to go to therapy. Not only because his behavior is damaging to you, but also because it’s an unhealthy environment for your children. Do you want your kids to start believing that it’s okay to swear at/be sworn at by their partner when they begin dating? 

ETA: He’s a grown ass man who can wake himself up for work. If he’s too irresponsible to get up for work in the morning, that’s honestly a sign of his own immaturity. You’re doing him a favor, and if his response to that favor is to treat you like shit, that’s totally unacceptable."

When you get back to the states, I would strongly recommend seeing a therapist, just to have a nonjudgmental outlet to process your childhood and your experience this summer.

"Aromatic?  I think you meant to type aromantic. 

It was a jolt for me to think you were saying he smells. Though that could affect his dating prospects.

Meaning that there are likely problems between them that contributed to the situation and the response to the threesome is a symptom of those problems.
"Cancun is built around inexpensive vacation travel, though--expensive to get to, but once you're there individual activities are not that pricy, and a lot of the resorts are mostly or all inclusive.

Let's say the wedding is 5 days in NYC.  If he/she stays in a hotel with the rest of the out of town wedding guests it's likely to be at least 300/night once you factor in taxes, and even an AirBNB is unlikely to be less than $200/night.  They will be eating in restaurants and likely doing some tourist activities, plus a gift and clothes.   It can be done for way less, obviously, if you plan well, but it's difficult to be the only budget traveler in a group of people with more expensive tastes, especially when the goal of the trip isn't to visit a location but spend time with those same people.  It would kind of defeat the purpose if  the people OP is  there to see want to go to Le Bernardin and she's like ""I'm just going to get some groceries and cook in my AirBNB in Queens.""

  
I'm just going to assume that OP has a good sense of what this would cost.  I think at that point it really becomes a question of whether the potential hurt feelings would outweigh the additional expense.  If she's smart about it and doesn't post pictures of her holiday trip all over social media I think probably most of her family wouldn't even realize that she's away.  If she needs to she could always say that the opportunity came up at the very last minute and she thought it would be rude to ask her cousin to squeeze her in at a time when couples are usually very busy."
So what are you gonna do about it my dude?
"I think the downvotes are for a couple of reasons: You assume OPs friends are peer-pressuring her into living how they live and talk about people being manipulated by their non-Mormon friends into rejecting their former beliefs. All signs in the OP point to her and her Mormon friends who hold the same beliefs making this decision together. 

Also, you call people immature for wanting to experience things. I mean, if we were talking about crystal meth maybe you'd have a point, but the desire to try things that bring joy to others (and that the majority of people don't develop problems with) is very normal and human. Why is it nonsense to want to know what something is like before you die? Personally I think exposing yourself to interesting experiences that could give you insight into the lives and perspectives of others can be a perfectly mature way of going about life."
You can't unsee it. Just tell her what you saw and point out the similarities and what that made you feel. Be direct and don't let this fester. 
"This is EXTREMELY emotionally abusive, and this behavior will scar his son for the rest of his life. This is really, really fucked up and will fuck the son up in all kinds of ways. I feel so sorry for him, he’s trapped in an abusive relationship and is probably walking on eggshells. No child should have to feel like that around the person who should love and protect them the most.

Your boyfriend either sounds like a narcissist or someone who is borderline. The guilt tripping, manipulation, demand for constant affection etc is so incredibly harmful. 

He’s committing what’s called “emotional incest”. You can look up the term if you want. Basically, a single parent will force their child into a partner role instead of a child role to fill the void. They become incredibly enmeshed and the parent will become entitled to the child’s time and affection. It’s super fucked up.

I don’t know what advice to give here, except for recommend therapy and leave. I couldn’t be with a man who abuses his child so blatantly. It would disgust me. "
Love bombing is a tactic narcissists do to reel you in. He’s 10 years older than you. He has the game down to a science. Expensive restaurant? Marriage talk? He’s leading you on. Your gut is right so if I were you I’d stop pursuing him. There really is something to be said about a man who goes for a woman 10 years younger than him.
"Yeah, I feel like she is in serious denial, or maybe she does the same thing (creeps on other men/women), therefore thinks it's okay. It's self-absorbed of her to think you were telling her just because you wanted \*her\* to know. You probably also told her because you want it to stop because this dude is making you uncomfortable, right, OP?

It's utter shit when you talk to another woman and you're like ""This guy is making me uncomfortable, he said this,"" and she's like ""Ohh! No, no no no, (Dude's name) is just *like that*!"" And laughs off your worries. It makes me want to respond with, ""Ohhh, (Dude's name) is a creep that everyone tolerates because they're afraid of confrontation?? Iiiii seeeeee!!!"""

Then he gets to be dad of the year with love-bombing. It’s not okay. It is abuse. There is a reason why there’s a pattern to it. It’s because your partner to a point *likes* what he gets out of this. He gets a guilt-free emotional release. He gets to be forgiven by a vulnerable person who *cant afford to refuse to forgive him*. 

Enmeshed is the word. I actually wouldn’t go the CPS route. I would alert either the mother or his school, see if there’s a counselor there. It’s emotional abuse. Call it as such. Make sure they’re aware of the sleeping arrangements and the actual pattern itself, ie dad raging for the moments leading to tearing down his own son. 

Please do something. Tell someone. It’s not okay. It’s a major red flag. "
"Getting him help or getting him drugs is the only way to not run out of your much needed pain relief.

You know one is a very bad option. The other may only be doable under threat(and follow-through) of leaving. He said himself that he cant help it. So if you don't insist on him getting help until he can, this current reality is your life.

Edit a word and to add-does the thought of his daughter having a pill-addicted father not break his heart? If he is not addicted(he is but for argument's sake)then he needs to get help for his self control. No one deserves to feel their trust slowly erode or to live in fear of their needed medication going missing."

"How long has the step father been in her life? Around the time the behavioural issues started? 

I would contact a lawyer and try and take over full custody of your child. The reaction of your ex makes me very suspicious - blaming a FIVE YEAR OLD for being a ""sexual being"", suggesting it could be someone from church and begging you not to destroy her family? If it were me, that would all be enough for me to not want my child to be in that situation. At the very best, her mom has all sorts of fucked up priorities. "
"I’m not commenting on his break-up or ex at all. I’m commenting on the trauma he’s likely still carrying with him that’s leading him to have issues with intimacy. 

His ex is immature and selfish. Like many 18yos. They’ve broken up, she doesn’t matter anymore.

Now it’s time to focus on more important things, like his emotional/mental/sexual health."
"Do you have any interest left in fixing things with your wife? If so, counseling. If not, then I agree with you that this doesn’t sound sustainable. "
"Go with you dad and then see it later with your husband. Easy. 

Your husband doesn’t sound like he absolutely wants to see if with you and your dad together, just that he wants to see it at all. 

This is not a big deal. 

Make your dad the priority. "
My wife makes more than me right now and we both work for the same school district. I am honestly so proud of her and all the hard work she put in to get where she is at. I plan on going into administration so eventually I will likely out earn her but honestly I am beyond excited that she is able to be self-sufficient if anything were to happen to me. It sounds like he is clearly pretty insecure in himself and he is taking it out on you which is super uncool. I would 100&amp;#37; take the job and use this as an opportunity to re-evaluate your relationship with this guy. 
"Ha. Sorry, we've all got our wires crossed here. I was referring to OP's evil husband's comments."
"You can't use hindsight to make him look bad. He had no idea at the time that his wife wanted him to end up with the hot friend, he found that out recently (also with that knowledge I wouldn't be surprised if the wife insisted he stay with the group). Also in regards to the depression, it sounds like he didn't realize how bad it was until reading the notes. He knew she was down most likely depressed but not severely depressed. "
"""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."" If this is a dealbreaker for you and he's proven that he isn't going to respect your boundaries, move on."

"&gt; If it was as easy as just deciding not to drink, more people would be recovering alcoholics.

You're underestimating how many recovering alcoholics and addicts you pass in a day. Many many more than you realize. There are recovery meetings going on in every major city and they happen hourly, 365 days a year. It was not until I dated a recovering addict that I could begin to fathom the immense number of people in recovery.

And it is as easy as deciding they won't drink anymore, but they have to make that decision every single day, sometimes every minute of every day on the difficult days, every day for the rest of their lives. "
Sounds like a girl I used to date. It didn't work out for me. Best of luck.
"When the relationship is already bad though, it could be seen as a wedge they could bring between the kid and her. Maybe she'd prefer OP turn down the money entirely? 

I don't know. But OP says at least twice it's not about her wanting the money for herself and he says openly they (family v. wife) have a rocky relationship but he doesn't say/know why. She might not want more kids because she fears this wealthy family will always be trying to cause problems in her family.

It seems weird to me the family has announced this bloodlines will thing. You don't have to tell your family the inheritance dictates before you die. You can just file the will. They put it out there to the family though which is a bit odd. "

"This side of the family might actually be populated by crap sacks. I interact with them as little as possible.

I agree. I'll look into filing a report with CPS.

Have you had any experience with how children are treated by CPS and the system as a whole?"
"Yeah I really hoped I was reading that wrong. The kid isn't being overly affectionate with his dad because they're such close pals, it's to protect himself from dads outbursts."
"Yes, it couldn't possibly be that mocking someone is usually a sign of disagreement and generally a rude thing to do in the first place. "
"That's rough but HPV is SUPER super common. 

The kind of strain that causes warts is actually pretty benign. The type of HPV that causes warts is not the same kind that causes cancer.

So, it sucks but just tell her and she can get checked and it's not the end of the world! Good luck."

"I feel like that’s a huge stretch and makes the guy seem evil. When all he said is literally one line, one time, while in the heat of the moment. And it wasn’t even something bad, or mean. 

I prefer condomless sex too - as a girl! I don’t understand who would take these comments personally or as an angle for “manipulation”.

If he never brought it up again, it’s not manipulation. It’s a drive by comment. It’s not his fault she’s hyper focused on it. Imo just let it go. Who cares?? If he doesn’t bring it up again why make this into some big deal and paint him as this manipulator of women? "
What exactly do you think the parents of a 28 year old man are supposed to do? Ground him?
"But u/aspidities_87 didnt say anything about that, they were mentioning that the OP was possibly misgendering someone which isn't ok.

"No, she should disengage not engage with this woman. Any sort of sympathy gives weight to her roomates lies. And it's all lies. The roommate isn't the victim of an abusive relationship, the roommate is the abuser. Do not engage the abuser with sympathy. It's just another weapon.

The roommate was abusive to the OP in their relationship.

The roommate was abusive with her (the roommate) boyfriend."
"Your dad is being a good dad and trying to stop your self-destructive behavior, or at the very least, refuse to enable it."
It's easier to say no initially than to force her out when she doesn't follow the rules.
Op hasn't responded in 6 hours. He's probably not on reddit. Seriously.
"""Looks aren't everything"" right after you use a fucking rating scale on her looks. Riiiiight. "
"Nope. She broke OP's heart, moved in with her affair partner, and now realises she didn't go with the best option.


Fucking tough. She does not deserve OP, and does not deserve a second chance. I mean to have an affair is one thing, to have an affair then break up with your partner for that person? You'd have to be a fucking doormat to accept that."
I was wondering if she and OP were cool at all - maybe she could convince her to do right by her fiancée and tell her sister to finally get over it. But I’m guessing that Alice is “the missing stair” that everyone is used to kowtowing to.
"You both fucked it up. I’m sorry, this is a terrible situation, but if you had not consented to sex to begin with, the HR department would have far more power to do more. At this rate, he can claim vindictiveness on your part because the two of  you “broke up.” I know it’s wrong, but that is the world we live in. Don’t sleep with your co workers. "
"Same with me and my friends! It sucks. It may be implicit to them, but men almost never do it the same way to each other "
"Maybe it's a cultural thing but wtf is up with OP's behavior and all these comments applauding her? 

A week is not that long and the guest wasn't malicious. If you're so sensitive don't invite people to stay over! 

Op is messed up for making a guest feel that uncomfortable. While they are sleeping under your roof is not the time to address their social problems. 

But seriously is this a Reddit thing or a western culture thing?

"Is the 1-year-old 12 months or 23 months?  In my experience, when my kid hit about 18 months, she was so super-clingy that it really was impossible for me to do anything.  The clingy stage lasted a few months, and the house sure wasn't spotless during that time.  Now that the kid is 2.5, I can do more housework and get her to ""help"" me, and the house is a lot cleaner, but it simply wasn't possible for me to do that at 18 months.  

Also, before you accuse your wife of being ""lazy"", try this experiment - take a day off from work, have your wife go out for the day, and hang out with the kid all day as the sole caretaker.  See how much housework you get done while also keeping an ever-vigilant eye on the kid to prevent him from killing himself.  "
"This is no way to live. You have to be able to relax in your own home. It is absolutely grounds for breaking up. Different levels of cleanliness can be an issue in any relationship but not being able to actually live in your own home is torture. End it. Tomorrow.

"My mom felt the same about hired cleaners. Her mother sometimes worked that job, so my mom was never comfortable being one of ""those people"" who needed help.

"I'm sorry to say that at this point you're right. If my sister won't stick up for me in a situation like this, I don't see the problem getting any better. I hope she gains some confidence and is able to stand up to her husband in the future, but at this point I just can't see it happening."

"Goddamn dude, this isn't just ""My wife cheated"", this is ""My wife cheated multiple times, then separated from me and moved across the country with the guy.""

She threw away everything you had together and left you at the drop of a hat. Do you really want to be with someone who could do that to you? If she just cheated one time and came to you immediately, then it'd be possible to work things out. But this is just insanity."

"And further, why is everyone talking about some bet? I don't see that mentioned anywhere"
Right?! She’s being downright mean and callous. So harsh to someone she wants to marry. 
You know what to do. You need to get out of there. I'm sorry your living situation is so awful. You are an adult you can get a job and get a place. You'll feel a lot better without these awful people in your face all the time.

"If she's hooking up with you, she's clearly not a lesbian. She's probably bisexual. Just communicate with her and see how she's feeling.  "
"&gt; You are neither abusive 

He's PROBABLY not abusive.  But the two things which are really grinding his gears in this post are situations where she's not doing a good enough job of anticipating his needs, and not obeying him to his satisfaction.  

Only got one roll of towels?  That's fine, I guess we'll need to get them again when we go shopping next weekend.

Don't want to turn on my air conditioning?  I guess I'll do it myself.

OP is totally magnifying her 'sins' out of all proportion and I'm struggling to understand his emotional meltdown here.

Threatening to disable part of her car as a way of 'proving' to her how ridiculous she is being is a totally unnecessary escalation.  In the comments he's saying how 'isolated' he's feeling, which MIGHT just be them both being petty and not being able to communicate well to resolve problems, but it might also him having a problem with her pulling back on doing the emotional labour in the relationship and rushing to soothe over the problems from this interaction for him so that he can feel better.

He needs to respect her autonomy just as much as she should do reasonable things for him."
Oh what a yuck attitude lol like all women are just dying for marriage. There’s no reason to assume that’s not a mutual decision. Been with my bf over six years and I have no plans or desires to get engaged any time soon.

"So, part of growing up and talking to girls is handling rejection when it happens. You aren't a weirdo, nothing bad happened, she just wasn't interested in you like you aren't interested in some girls. Going there and saying hi if you see her and just being normal is what you need to do. Being cool with rejection and knowing when to cool your jets, and not being a thirsty, creepy weirdo, and just enjoying yourself at the party will make you seem cool, because it is cool. Maybe she has a friend who sees you at this party and she hooks you two up because you're not some weirdo who makes a huge deal about it when someone isn't interested? You never know."
"My first thought was that friend may be an anxious wreck with an abusive partner. 

Then I realised it was multiple friends and I was confused. 

This detail still makes me feel, in that ones case,  “abusive husband”.

I still think it’s weird and wrong to demand you leave regardless of the friends’ relationships though."
She wasn't being absurd tho
"You're still young enough to get back into it and look healthier again. I'm also 5'0F, and have struggled with weight.

"Ok my ex was like this and when I talked to him about it the jist was basically he was trying to impress me/catch me in the beginning and now that he had me he could let go on that front. Except relationships aren't just get girl, have fun with the girl, and stop doing all those things the girl liked about you that you did.

Basically I told him he was nasty and I refused to be close or intimate with nasty. And everytime he would get better before backsliding, and eventually I figured if I was going to be on the couch cause he nasty then I'd rather be single and on the couch.

This is where you have to decide if this is a dealbreaker, and then recognize that this is who he is (frankly I put up with it because it was partly a symptom of his depression and he doesn't mind being dirty). We broke up because being clean is important to me (so important that when my own depression was bad I would still shower every day and brush my damn teeth and use mouthwash) but hey maybe you can find something that works for you two without having to feel like his mom."

"He isn't joking. He said he didn't want a one-night stand because that puts a lot of women off. It's better bait to say that there's a chance for something more but he's really just after some ass.  I've got an itching feeling that if you two meet up and bang, he'll evaporate into thin air. "
"Yeah OP should just accept a big life changing decision and not try to reason with her about something that has major consequences for him, because that would be manipulation! /s

I'm sure OP and his gf can have a normal adult discussion about this and should continue to discuss this. "
He saw a tiny little chance of risk (lots of people are suspicious of the govt) and decided to maybe protect himself rather than certainly help you. 
Because they are still legally married AND have responsibilities together?
"Please break up with her so she can date someone who is not so shallow and concerned with how ""ladylike"" she may or may not be, which is what she deserves. If she doesn't want to shave, she shouldn't. It is not, in fact, unhygienic as long as she continues to care for and clean herself...I mean the hair is there for a reason. There are plenty of guys out there for her who genuinely won't care."
"You don't have any ability to make her abort the pregnancy, or even give the child up for adoption.  So, if she chooses to have the baby, she's having the baby.

You are going to need to get a Family Attorney and get legal advice on this issue.  In many places, you shouldn't put your name on the birth certificate until DNA testing has been done to confirm paternity.  You also need to get child support and custody/visitation legally established.  These are big issues that can be very, very expensive if you try to DIY and screw up.

As another poster mentioned, the baby is a related, but separate, issue from your relationship.  There are things your GF may want (marriage, move in together, financial support...) from you that you may not want.  Don't allow yourself to be pressured to make choices you don't want.  Don't compound one error in judgment with several more.

This baby is going to need support. Start working and saving, now, so you are more able to cover doctor's bills, child support, and the like, once the baby is born.  Plan for that eventuality.  "
"I'd just have a conversation with them when they arrive. Tell them that with their dad recovering and not capable of helping out as much, you are really going to need their help this summer in keeping the house clean and picking up after themselves. You can tell them that it is important to keep everything clean and sanitary for their dad. I'm sure they will be willing to do this and will understand. I'd then ask them what chores they would be willing to take on in order to contribute and let them each pick something that they are responsible for (ex: one of them is in charge of taking out the garbage every day, one is in charge of loading the dishwasher before bed, etc). And then just ask them if they are okay with you reminding them if they forget. 

This way the kids understand why they need to help out, and they get to choose in which way they contribute so they feel like they have a say in it. "

"Well it seems to be at least weekly sessions for an entire semester, and it wasn't only counseling it was also his parents stopped speaking to him? 

This is what I dont understand, the parents stopped speaking to him because he requested an iPod they gave him for Christmas? And got weekly sessions because of it? We must be missing some seriously key details here, like the sister lied about some abuse, then said it was for an iPod or something because wtf?

The after sessions may have been the school councilors try to help OP cope with that and cover their asses cause they fucked up?

I mean if OP feels that abused by his sisters yeah, definitely avoid them but this story is very confusing "

&gt; There is power in mercy, but if the people themselves know they have more unpleasant options and they demand the mercy with an emotional stick so that they don't have to do the hard work, it's unlikely that it will do either the giver or the receiver good.&gt;

Bailing them out won’t change their minds or behavior for you, except maybe to ask for more money more often, and IF they use the money correctly and save the house, they’re likely to put it at risk again for the next idea. So you’d all be back where you started except that you’re out the funds you gave them and can’t help them next time or build your own future.

You can show kindness and have boundaries. Mercy doesn’t have to be financial - offer the adults advice and look for ways to support the kids. Someone mentioned summer camps and college funds, just pay the camps directly or start accounts for the kids that the parents can’t raid. 

It sounds like your father’s caring still impacts you today, shining through the sabotage, and that could be a lovely gift to share with your nieces and nephews. Maybe offer child care and see if you bond with any of the kids over games or homework. Mentoring can be extremely rewarding for everyone involved and may build some family feelings even if you have to skip over your sisters. Family dynamics of scapegoats and golden children can be repeated; you may end up modeling good behavior the kids don’t see elsewhere or even nurturing a scapegoat who’s having trouble recognizing their potential in that family.

You don’t set yourself on fire (financially or otherwise) to keep them warm."
"A bit of clarification...they were never married. They dated for a bit when he was very young and she got pregnant right before he was set to begin his military career thus the lack of legal parameters. But your question is one that I asked him and he seems to believe for whatever reason that she will keep her word. I think at this point he’s just agreeing to whatever in a bid to get custody of his son. Or tip the scales in his favor. Supposedly the boy’s mother is pregnant (this will be her 4th, 3rd child with current bf) and a friend of hers is moving in with her children and she ‘needs the extra space’. "

"If it was one of your male friends getting attached to her when you weren’t there, would you want her to keep it a secret? I’d be really worried that if this gets worse it’s going to be framed as you encouraging her friend (as that may be genuinely how the friend is reading this), in which case your silence will look guilty as hell. Tell your girlfriend that you’re worried about it as a possibility, and try and navigate a way through this together. Please protect your relationship, OP. "

What your wife did wasn't okay, but there can be solutions and it could very likely be her mental or physiological health that's causing this behavior , especially since it's newer behavior.  "
"&gt;he almost facilitates the cheating for his friends

He literally drove his friend and this other girl back to friend's place. Not even almost facilitating, literally doing so. And as a very non-confrontational person myself I understand not wanting to get involved, but he is *involving himself in helping his friend cheat*. He *knows* how much it sucks to be cheated on, but here he is just the same.

On the bright side, your boyfriend will probably never have back issues because he doesn't have a spine anyway. "
I think that's the point... Not much of an ESA if you feel like you can leave it behind like a phone charger...

"I'm sorry this happened to you. It happened to a girl I knew growing up from my friends group too. There was an older guy early-mid 20s that we all thought was cool and we were all 13-14. He was a friend of a few of our older brother's, so it wasn't THAT weird to us when he would hang out or drive us to go out places. A few of us suspected but never spoke out, and I really regret that. Eventually the girl came forward and reported him, and he did it to a lot of other girls and ended up getting 15 years I believe when I was going away to college.

It's just not something you notice as a teenager, you don't think anything is wrong with someone in their 20s wanting to be your friend. But now that I'm older, I think it's a pretty rare circumstance that someone over 21 should be friends/texting/chatting with highschoolers.

I dont own a car but do have insurance to be able to drive one. If I need to borrow/rent a car. Some people are just lousy drivers like my one daughter and your GF. 

Stand firm. Don't risk your finances regardless of relationship status. Seriously that can change. 

"
Holy fuck. Get away from her. She's toxic.
Seriously. They're acting like she was running around in a thong and nipple tassles. It sounds like the bathing suit was just not age approprate and I'm sure it wasn't even that bad. This is the same as idiots that say a woman is asking to be sexually harassed or raped because they wear a short skirt/revealing outfit.
"Ok so yes, you are trolling. Cool."
"I may be pulling the age card, but I have lived through just exactly this kind of thing when I was your age. So here goes: You started dating this guy when you were not even a legal adult. You are still a youngster. A girl your age is a prime candidate to have lots and lots of dates and fun times with many, many young men and friends. Go a live it up! There are tons of possibilities and options out there for you. Also, these years are the time for you to invest in yourself: education, developing hobbies, pursuing interests. Get to know yourself better, learn to be comfortable and happy - accepting of yourself.   Your bf is NOT ready emotionally or socially or developmentally to be in a longer committed relationship. It will be hard, it will be sad, it will feel upsetting and will be a loss, however, I promise you that there are BETTER relationships out in front of you - move forward without this player-boy in a man's body/"
"I can’t tell you how many times he’s held that against me for something or other. When his son comes to visit, I don’t immediately jump up and shower him with affection=I don’t like him. He’s 15 years old...not a baby. I speak and that’s that. Or I want to have a girls day out and don’t invite him along=I don’t like his son. Or when he comes to visit, I kind of move to the background to let him spend time with him since he doesn’t get to see him often (mother is temperamental)=I don’t like his son. "
"I'm not sure you have a large gap in 'values' so much as what you do with those values. I encourage you to think about what actions you can take that are likely to be most impactful because I know from experience what it's like to be passionate about an issue or movement, put a huge amount of effort and emotion into a social media or other such communication, and feel like at least you did _something_ when in actuality your husband is probably right that social media posts fall on deaf ears and debates in that setting are highly, highly unlikely to change any minds. You MAY be exhausting yourself with efforts that don't move the needle.

What's good about this is that if you pause and think about the *best* use of your time on the issues you are passionate about you can focus your attention on putting those actions in place and hopefully spend less time on fruitless efforts that are taking you away from your family. Try not to get judgmental that you care about these things more than those around you - surely there are issues you don't pay much attention to that someone else would consider more important than the things you care about. 

If your husband feels you put political debates and advocacy over your time with him and your child, that seems to me like a valid concern. So I suggest you work with him on the amount of time each day or week you want to spend on those efforts, and then put your all into those things during that dedicated time, but also respect and honor the time you dedicate to spending with your family."
"I like this advice. 

If it's your friend, help her see what she's doing is wrong. Help her understands he deserves to be someone's number one and that he's not irreplaceable. 

Tell her how wrong it is what she is doing and how hurt his wife would be if she finds out . How would your friend feel if she later found out BIL was with another woman after thinking they were exclusive? 

Tell her how you feel about marriage and her standing up for you if she is content to destroy one. 

I dunno, I found that when I was young I didn't understand cheating. It was easy, black and white.  Good. Bad.  As I get older, see situations, talk to people, it's a mess. Good and bad people cheat for good and bad reasons. 

It's your friend, shes obviously upset enough to tell you about it. Help her, don't scorn her. 

And remember what shes capable of. Never forget that. But still, people can learn and grow from mistakes. "
"&gt;He also says he can't really do anything and claims I also am not doing anything other than spending a lot of time trying to education people on social media (which he claims often just ends up in pointless arguments).

He is right every second you spend on social media ""educating"" people is a second wasted.  No one changes their view because of what some random person says on social media."
"I'm sorry OP.  I'll admit I don't have much advice, but as an older pregnant woman, I had to unsub from /r/pregnant as everyone there would say things such as: ""You're pregnant.  You deserve this.""  ""Take advantage of the fact that you're pregnant..."" Women have been getting pregnant since literally the beginning of the human race.  The entitlement I see right and left from those that are pregnant boggles my mind and it sounds as though your wife has the same mentality.  Please don't commit suicide.  Your child will be so much better with you in his life."
"This is weird as hell. But he has no right to tell you how to dress, or to tell you not to stuff your bra if you wanted. And just as he can't tell you what to wear, you have no right to do the same to him. Either accept it or hit the eject button."
"My sister (edit: a teacher) used to live in Arizona and one year it turned out that a tarantula had laid eggs somewhere in her classroom. She was completely unaware of this fact until she came in one morning and found the place swarming with tiny little baby tarantulas. Unlike your wife, my sister did the sensible thing, which was to scream at the top of her lungs, evacuate her room, and refuse to return until it had been species-ly cleansed. 

So perhaps your wife should move to Arizona, where there are all the interesting spiders that one could wish for (my sister also discovered a black widow in her garden shed; she did not see the red fiddle and thought that she had acquired a cool little spiderbro) and leave you to squash the absolute crap out of whatever spiders it is that have invaded your house. "
"If I was dating someone and they took their pants off to cuddle on the couch, I’d definitely think we were having sex. On the other hand, I don’t assume my wife wants to have sex unless she says “let’s have sex”.  His reaction doesn’t sound great, but I can imagine from where he is coming. 


No one needs a reason to not have sex. If you don’t want, you don’t have. That part is bullshit."
good point. i will.
"Thinking ""That girl is hot"" isn't wrong. It's when a guy is specifically and continuously trying to date girls under 18 that we have a problem."
MIL is there too. So it’s not just the wife watching the toddler alone.

But, I did speak to the member of the team (who is the point of contact for the award) this morning. She denied any involvement (I didn’t accuse her of anything) and emailed the magazine for clarification and so far it seems like they will look into it.

"I believe OP did tell her about the Snapchat incident, but did it in a light-hearted way so as to not be appearing to make a big deal out of it.

&gt;I mentioned what happened as casually as possible and she laughed it off, so I left it.

I think what she regrets is not bring honest with her concerns at that time. OP, I think it's OK to say that now, though! Be honest that you thought the Snapchat thing was really disrespectful, and you regret not making that clearer at the time, because you don't think he treats her well overall. Tell her you care about her and you don't want to butt in to her personal decisions, but that you think she shouldn't have to put up with that kind of shabby treatment."
Tell them. Exaggerate if you have to. Tell them he has made threats and you are fearing for your life. Record the threats if you have to. And 100% call the police if he keeps doing this. Does your city have noise laws?

"&gt; She probably had sex with at least 7 other guys between 18 and 25 and that obviosuly didn't bother you earlier. So now her count is 8...does this really make it different?

"There are 3 possible options I can see:

- She has a crush on you and is being 15 about it. 

- She is jealous of the time you spend with her sister.

- There's something else going on in her life that's upsetting her, and she's taking it out on you.

You can probably ""test"" whether it's either of the first two by seeing if an overt display of affection between you and your girlfriend causes any change in the sister's behaviour (sulking, snarky comment, whatever).

Whatever the explanation is though, I think your course of action should be the same. Firstly, you sit down with her and you tell her you won't be tolerating her comments any more. Then you follow through on that by literally ignoring her if she's horrible to you. Secondly, you tell your girlfriend that if her sister won't treat you with respect then she can't come over any more. Ban her for a couple of weeks, let her back, if the behaviour continues then ban her again. Her coming to your house is a privilege, not a right. Thirdly, your girlfriend needs to sit down with your sister and tell her that being respectful towards you is non-negotiable. You and your girlfriend need to get on the same page here, and right now it sounds like your girlfriend is more taking her sister's side than yours, which you and your gf need to address. Fourthly, your girlfriend needs to sit down with her sister and ask her *what's wrong*, because while your girlfriend is ignoring her sister's behaviour, there's potentially a big problem going undealt with. Whether it's something serious or just that she's jealous, he sister needs to be taught that she cannot treat people this way, and that won't happen if there are no consequences."
"&gt; only met 1 girl (who was pretty ugly tbh but her pics looked alright)

Really reflect on why you felt the need to put this in your post. Did you honestly think we'd read that and be like 'oh, poor little dude has had a hard time...' Get real about that, if that tone creeps into how you interact with people it will only work against you. 

If someone says they are high maintenance they probably are. It means they are scared to commit, or know that if they do commit they will probably have issues or misgivings or whatever. It is like a disclaimer that they will hurt you eventually because they are too weak to become they kind of people that won't hurt their partners. You can ignore that but it will come back to haunt you. Heck, that she is saying you can be friends and go on a date shows just how messy things will be.

Dating apps aren't the be all and end all of dating. Meeting people, especially friends of friends or going to events or whatever, that is still a huge part of dating. 3 months isn't even that long to be playing the field. Just have patience. "

"You are so absolutely wrong. Snooping destroys trust and will eventually drive your children away from you. Treat your children as people, because they are people. They aren’t property. "
"&gt; So they give you an allowance but won't let you spend it how you want?

To be fair here, OP's 15 and there should be some oversight of spending. The snooping's not OK, probably **the spending restrictions are overbearing** too. But in principle yes a parent should be making sure their 15 yo kid is not being taken by MLM bullshit, or buying something illegal, or buying a 6 foot iguana they have no space for, or whatever.

"If you're only staying quiet because you think it's noble, tell the truth of what happened to you.  You are being abused.  Tell the relative what happened."
"I think your mother's attitude may be a little healthier here. Sure, your daughter may have a very clear idea about herself now that stays true forever, but she may not. Lots of kids are averse to the opposite sex, and lots develop same sex ~crushes that don't bespeak adult homosexuality (or bisexuality). I also just don't see why it's such a big deal that your mother accept your daughter's sexuality as done deal fact at least five years to a decade before your daughter may date anyone."
"Wow a lot of these comments are sexist. Sure this guy should have a stable job, but at least he's working. OP I feel like you should be spending this time worrying about your own employment..

"&gt;are you putting your political stuff aside to work on your family?

Of course not. There's people wrong on the Internet she has to correct!"
Absolutely this. It's not a moral failing that she's a victim of abuse. 
"To answer your question about why the change, could be many reasons. Maybe someone said something to her and it was one time too many. Maybe she realized recently how it might look. Maybe in 5 years she changed in some way, and decided that it might not be appropriate anymore to go alone with you. Or, maybe she thinks lines blurred even if you don't think they did. It doesn't mean you're creepy or you did anything wrong. This just, to her, would be disrespectful to your relationship, even if other people wouldn't think so. It's how she feels about boundaries. Also, it doesn't seem like you lost a friend! She just said she didn't want to go alone with you. That's not so bad. You can still hang out and stuff.

Also, if you met your friend before you met your wife, so she would've been like 27ish? She may have decided as she's gotten older that despite it being in public and all, hanging out alone with taken male friends may be less comfortable as it was when she was younger unless it was like a close friend's husband."
"Wow your husband has my insides, by the sound of it. I had 6 months of nausea with my gallstones. I only had one pain attack like the normal symptoms of gallstones are thought of, the constant nausea was ghastly. Getting my gall bladder out finally was such a relief. 

I also have IBS which gives me similar symptoms too so it's not all great but meds for that work. Again I don't have the cramps normally associated with IBS, at least not very much, but I still have nausea and bloating etc. 

I know you asked for advice about supporting him but I'm perhaps not best placed for that. I don't want people around when I'm I'll and I'm an introvert so being inside is not an issue for me. Just being sick is super wearing though so try to see if he'll try therapy to help himself. I needed it."

"This may be well intentioned but I honestly don’t see why a 15 year old has the walk her mother through the “my kids are growing up” phase. That isn’t her role in all this. She is the child.

"You guys are clearly incompatible. That's the issue here. There's nothing wrong with her behavior to me but I would never date a guy who was still into the party hard lifestyle at 30, not because I'm morally opposed to this, but simply because that's not the kind of guy I want at my age. This is not a lifestyle I could keep up with and I would grow resentful very fast. "
"I would check your lease, but generally she can't police who you bring over. I would try to find a different living situation because this girl is clearly unreasonable and unwilling to compromise. If you talk to your landlord, he/she may be able to tell you if your roommate can do anything about you having your bf over (although there is sometimes a weekly sleepover limit). Ask your roommate how she would feel about you saying xyz(whoever she has over most often) was no longer allowed to come over. 

If you find out she can't get you in trouble, just bring your bf over and keep him in your room as much as possible. Then find a new roommate for when your lease is up. "

"If I were you, I'd put school on hold and get a job RIGHT THIS SECOND. Then start going to school very part time. Slowly establish savings and independence. Yes, the kids will need childcare. But you need to get a career going lady. This dude doesn't give a shit about your best interests. To let you sit at home with the kids for 6 years without that paperwork filed... he is in a prime position to royally fuck you over.  


You need to get out of that situation. I'm not saying you HAVE to leave him. But you sure as hell need to start building up employment history, get your kids into daycare, and start thinking about what would ACTUALLY happen if homeboy decided to run off with someone else. Because it happens.  


He flat out refuses to marry you. Many men who act like that end up getting married... to another woman. Stop letting yourself languish in this supremely vulnerable position. You need to start making moves. Don't ask him about you getting a job: Tell him. Tell him that the two of you will be splitting childcare costs."
"Sounds like you still are struggling with her mental instability. A 4th child is certainly not going to make that any easier. She needs to givenupcth ghost and play the hand she was dealt. It's not going even like it's a bad hand, here. She's got a husband who clearly cares for her and three healthy sons, that, hopefully never find out their mother wishes they were girls."

"It sounds like she is trying to run a cult-like business environment in which her employees are inappropriately emotionally overinvested in the workplace. This makes them easier to control (or perhaps just more psychologically satisfying for her).

I understand that you like the job but organizational behaviour is as much a part of the job as your actual work description, and if it's a bad fit you're going to be unhappy there. In this case it's a bad fit because of the inappropriate boundary trampling and forced emotional intimacy. 

That just doesn't sound like a healthy environment. Add in your references to sororities and your description of yourself as a ""weirdo"" or outsider and it sounds like it may also be playing into a long-buried dynamic from your past, making you vulnerable to being manipulated and hurt.

My advice to you is pretend to play along if you're worried about losing your job,  but don't really invest in it emotionally at a personal level. Try to remind yourself every day that your worth as an employee  (and as a person) is not *really* tied to the things your boss thinks it is.

What your husband is doing is unacceptable. I get that its probably rooted in insecurity but, still. He needs to think about how his behavior is affecting the people around him. 

Also, the article thing is fucked up. I would have responded, ""Look, I get that you're trying to find a way to rationalize how you feel.

"This is a really good idea. I once had a similar experience as OP, felt all the feelings and joys for about a week or two. Then she asked me to take a road trip with her and I decided I needed to take a step back and really think about my feelings. I told her I liked her a lot but it was too soon for something like that. She got really offended and defensive and all sorts of weird. The ""relationship"" crumbled very soon after. I realize now she was probably in a strange place and was super excited about feeling super excited. And we just kept ramping up the excitement. So when I came along and put a slight damper, it felt like a sledgehammer. She wasn't interested in me, she was just interested in being excited. I have no place making insinuations about OP's situation, but taking a little step back, and getting some sleep is almost never a bad idea. If she's in a stable place and legitimately likes OP, all will be well and it'll probably be good in stabilizing the relationship. If not, crumble away, and that'll be good for him too. It'll suck. But it'll be better for him in the long haul. "
You need to insist that he sees a different doctor and attend his initial appointment with him. His current GP is enabling him.

"I've never understood why some people don't get this. Staying faithful to my wife is the easiest thing I've ever done.

"The main issue here is that she has stopped you from communicating with exes, yet she continued to be in contact with a previous fling without your knowledge. I think you need to be honest with yourself about how you truly feel about this, because your annoyance about her assumption that they’re going to be friends in ten years’ time tells me you’re not as ok with this as you’re making out. 

Different people have different boundaries, and I’m not saying that either of you are wrong, but I think you’re upset at the “injustice” of having broken contact with people at her behest while she carries on and meets up with this guy. She’s not ok with you maintaining contact with your exes, while you don’t seem to mind, so I think you either have to accept that you have different comfort thresholds or be more honest with both yourself and her about how happy you really are with this.

It'll hurt, it usually does when someone close to you zeros in on your insecurities. That said, some people are just terrible with words. My bf isn't the greatest at times when he's trying to lift me up verbally. But his actions can speak louder than his words at times, so I know he means well. If your BF is the same, look for those actions. Like if he gives you those ""you're looking sexy ;) "" kind of eyes revel in it. That's all you baby :-). Do a little self reassuring, remind yourself that he did pick you and that sometimes people can be a doofus even when they don't mean to be. Hope it helps, and hope everything works out. (PS. Sounds like he owes you some favors, just saying lol)."
"Yes! This is an abusive relationship. She is also working to isolate him from his family. He doesn’t mention friends, but I’d be surprised if he was allowed any of those. 

And all this is about her anxiety, not her abuse. Because OP doesn’t even recognise it as abuse. Which means he sees her abusive behaviour as a problem he needs to help her fix. 

Please leave - you deserve so much better than this. "

"This. My mom and stepdad regularly forgot what time to pick me up and were way to late or forgot to pick me up at all. Considering the fact that I went to the same small school for 6 years, within a year the teachers knew me as ""that poor kid that was always forgotten"". Fun times."
I can't agree with this comment more. 
"Herpes can be passed on even with a condom. This has nothing to do with irresponsibility on his part. Like you said, doctors don't usually check for it. 

90% of people have some form of herpes, and only 1/6 of them show it. You're in the 1/6, he's in the 5/6. 

Now you can happily have sex without worrying about accidentally giving it to your partner. (Don't think you are trapped and can only date him, plenty of people in your future will already have the virus and not know it just like him.)

For you, ask your doctor about supressive therapy. 500mg a day of Valacyclovir for a year has shown a reduction in outbreaks afterwards. "
"It sounds like you both feel the other partner is expecting too much of you. Your wife feels you are burdening her with the majority of the housework, and that when you do chores you half-ass it so she has to do them again. I'm not sure based on what you said but sometimes in these situations the person also feels that the higher earning or busier partner views them as less important, doesn't appreciate their housework contributions, or expects them to do all the domestic work because they're female. 

On your end, it sounds like you feel deeply taxed by your demanding job, you feel that your wife's opinion that your domestic work is not up to snuff is meaningless criticism or complaining, and her requests for you to do more around the house are unreasonable.

From our vantage point we can't truly tell you whether your wife's critique of your chores is valid or not. We can't really say even what division of labor would be fair. But the thing I feel from reading this is that neither of you feel that the other one supports and cares about you, and it might be impossible to agree on a division of labor that both partners would accept and think was fair because you both have such little trust and respect for each other and neither of you feel the other is investing in your partnership. Maybe you'd like your wife to appreciate how taxing your life is and be caring and forgiving when you're tired and stressed, and it sounds like she'd like you to demonstrate that you are willing to contribute to your partnership by putting in effort toward the home. 

One thing that does stand out to me is your offer to do your own laundry. To me, it doesn't  make sense for half of a couple to do only half of the laundry since it's much easier and efficient to do all the laundry in one batch. She currently does all the laundry I think. But when you offer to help with this chore, you only offered to do ""your half"" of it. That to me is an example of how you are thinking of you and your wife as two individuals, not as a unit. Also your offer to do more by doing your own laundry starts from the assumption that your wife is doing all the work associated with this task, and rises to the level only of doing your own half. 

How you divide the labor is one thing but the more important issue here is the contempt, disinvestment, and lack of forgiveness and generosity you appear to feel for each other. Couple's counseling might be a step. "

"Your boyfriend really needs to stop being nice about this.  They do **not** get a vote about your family planning and need to shut the hell up about it.

Honestly it's absurd that they even know about your infertility, much less are weighing in (to you!) about how your boyfriend should proceed.

If he hasn't already said it, something to the effect of ""We're already happy with the family we have,"" possibly followed by  ""and aren't looking for your opinions about that"" would go a long way.  

If they escalate, just totally shutting down the conversation is necessary.  "
"If he was your distant godfather who basically had nothing to do with you growing up and periodically checked in on the surface level, would you feel obligated to have him walk you down the aisle? No.

He didn’t and he isn’t so you have no obligation to try and make your wedding day as magical as he wants it to be. Sounds like you know exactly who you want to walk you down the aisle and it sounds like he shows up every day and supports you in every way he can. "

"Well you're either out $700 (unless you can sell them which I'm sure you can) or you're out your car insurance, phone bill, and whatever it'll cost you to change your tuition plans. Look, they are being absurd and it sucks, but now you get to decide if it is worth your independence to pay your own bills or not. Unfortunately, they can cut you off for any damn reason they please. The flip side of that is that once you support yourself fully you can live your life any damn way you want and they don't get to control you anymore.  You need to decide whether getting the start in life their support is giving you is worth the costs (not being able to go to the festival and dealing with what I would assume is other similar restrictions) or if going to the festival is worth losing their support.

If you are trying to get them to see reason I wouldn't use the ""nothing is going to happen in a tent because it is cold and isn't romantic"" argument or ""I'm perfectly safe because I don't do drugs"" or ""this is for my career."" They know perfectly well that plenty of people fuck in tents, and the implications of that argument are ""things would happen if it were warm and romantic"" or ""I'm too naive to truly understand what a festival is like or what a sexual relationship is like and therefore am vulnerable to others taking advantage.""  Similarly, they aren't just worried about your behavior here.  They clearly don't like your boyfriend and have other safety related concerns that are likely more about the behavior of others. As for your career, I get that you are going into the music industry, but there are other ways to further your career and to show them you take your career seriously.  So that needs to be a whole different conversation with them. No one thinks you want to go to this primarily because it is a networking opportunity you simply can't miss. 

I think instead that maybe trying to show them your maturity here might make more sense. As in, acknowledge legitimate concerns about safety (""neither partner nor I intend to take drugs or drink and I'm going to be very careful about not accepting anything including food or beverage items from strangers and not being alone with people I don't know well given the level of drug use that is present. We also made a plan to not be apart for two long for safety reasons, I'm bringing X friend who will also be in the tent with us""), have an actual conversation about why they don't like your boyfriend and give them a chance to express concerns (you've been with the guy ten months, you're this enmeshed with your parents and all you know about why they don't like him is ""unknown reasons""?  ask them, gently and calmly to help you understand their reasons and actually listen without getting defensive before you address their reasons/ thank them for their concern for you safety and well being even if you disagree with their reasons and state that you appreciate knowing you can come to them for support if it doesn't end up working out but that right now you want them to also support you and your choice to continue the relationship), and have a clear conversation with them about sex and what their expectations are about how you date and engage with your partner or future partners while accepting their financial support. Tell them if you can live with those expectations or not. At a different time, have a conversation about the implications of your career choice (""being in the music industry means I am at times going to be around people you don't approve of or in situations where substance use might be present. I know I can handle that safely, but it sounds like you have doubts. Let's figure out if you are able to support that aspect of my career and come up with a plan for what is reasonable.""). 

In other words you can make this a ""I want to go to the festival and my mean parents said no so I'm going to either insist, sneak there behind their back, or pout and sulk about not going"" situation, or you can use this as an opportunity to see if you can show them you're an adult and see if they have the capacity to be more flexible and reason with you.  If you discover it isn't possible for you and your parents to come to any sort of longer term consensus then you know you need to find a new plan to be self-supporting ASAP. You get to decide if you do it by declaring your independence, going to the festival and then figuring out the rest or if you'll not go to the festival and instead make a better plan to stay on their payroll until you can support yourself. In other words, ""I heard you say no about this festival and I respect that, but it also made me consider where the boundaries are in the future, let's all have a conversation about that."" "

"Firstly how is that - if it were true - relevant? Gay people can be both male and female. 
It sounds like you just pulled out some random statement to grind a very different axe.

Secondly I don't believe this is true. Most studies say men commit more violence and abuse against children than women, especially when not biologically their own. If you look at the stats for sexual abuse for example, men are by far the largest group of perpetrators. If selecting only for biological children, women outnumber men in certain types of abuse, such as neglect.

Additionally women tend to be the primary caregivers of children so the incidence you would expect would be far higher but that's not the case. 

I am not sure why you pulled this statement out to be honest. It's just out of left field and probably speaks more to your own mindset than anything relevant to this comment thread. "
"To an extent it kind of is.

"The fact that you just stood there and allowed someone to ridicule a person you love speaks volumes about your character. I would not be able to respect a partner who let their family say mean and nasty things about me, regardless of whether or not I could understand them. Your actions in this moment demonstrate to Olivia that you are not willing to show integrity when it counts. You were willing to tolerate somebody treating the person you love like crap. It doesn’t matter whether or not Olivia could understand your grandmother. You showed Olivia that you won’t have her back in situations that would make you uncomfortable. 

It’s hard to stand up to a racist family member. But if you love somebody, you have to be willing to put yourself out there to stick up for them when it counts. You didn’t (really) do this, and Olivia might not forgive you. You have to demonstrate that you are not going to put up with this shit. To give you a little bit of benefit of the doubt here, maybe you were worried that if Olivia didn’t understand your grandma, you’d escalate the situation and make Olivia even more anxious. Like, if you call Grandma out and Olivia thought y’all were all having a good time, she’d suddenly get stressed out. BUT, my dude: have you ever been the one non-bilingual person in a room? A lot of folks in my family speak Spanish and it’s not exactly subtle when everybody shifts to a language they know you don’t understand. (You learn certain words pretty quickly tho lol).

One of the hardest things in any conflict is knowing you were in the wrong and accepting that you might not be able to make it right. The only way you can try is by showing Olivia with your actions that you won’t accept anybody mistreating her in your presence. [EDIT: you can do this by saying things like “abuela, this is unacceptable and if you continue insulting Olivia we are going to leave.” She might guilt trip you, but you gotta call her bluffs when that happens if you don’t want to enable this kind of behavior.] Part of feeling safe with a partner is trusting that they have your best interests at heart. That includes sticking up for them when other loved ones overstep boundaries or insult them. Good luck, dude. "

"Maybe talk to your therapist for a sensitive way to phrase this... but ask him for something more solid than ""maybe in the future."" Like... how long does he expect you to feel like this?

If he's think in terms a maybe a few weeks, that's one thing. If he's thinking a few months? Nah, that's too long to leave you hanging on your own. 

Confession: I'm biased against him somewhat because he's coming off as pretty selfish. Telling you that you can't understand just because you already have a kid, as if that means you were wanting this one any less? Especially after you were the one who actually had to deal with all the medical side of things? I know he's grieving too, but damn. And then to essentially say he doesn't want to work on your relationship until it's convenient for him and I kind of want to smack him over the head a bit. 

But I really do think that, bias or no, he owes you more than just ""maybe in the future."""

"I have scars on my arms and legs. I've also had this thought of covering them up, however for me it's not an option as short sleeves are part of my uniform, the area to cover is too big and you're right - scars are fine, tattoos are not in my line of work. Personally, I don't even notice them anymore, I just forget they're there. Like freckles or birthmarks. I have the benefit of them not being very noticeable and being from the UK so no one would dare ask (kidding!) - I might feel differently if they were keloid or my skin tone was such that they are particularly dark/light and noticeable. Essentially, I'm super pale, the scars are white and they are so extensive it just blends into my normal skin tone. I'm pretty sure they have also become less noticeable with time. I've had people be confused/shocked they haven't noticed my scars after knowing me for years and I've also had a super rude guy grab my arm to look at them after speaking to me one afternoon so I think people are just varying levels of observant. 

In terms of tattoos, there are a few things to consider - although ink will cover scars, it will also draw attention to your arms. Although people have the sense to not be like 'cool scars! what do they mean?' that's exactly what people do with tattoos. Additionally, scars change the texture of your skin so although the colour may be gone, if someone was looking at your tattoo they might still see the scars and, arguably, more people will be looking at your arms if you tattoo them. You also have the issue of relapsing (I don't know how far into recovery you are) - because of the tattoo, you would have to self-harm elsewhere on your body and that can be dangerous depending on where you choose. Depending on your work, tattooing your wrists also means long sleeves throughout summer which is not only uncomfortable, it's a pain to coordinate - for me, as well, this would be too reminiscent of when I was self-harming. Depending on where you are and what you have access to, you might have more luck in looking at medical scar reduction options (we have it here on the NHS) and I think the Red Cross offers professional camouflage makeup for scars if your goal is just reducing their appearance at work/around nosy people.

It's going to end up being a very personal decision. For what it's worth, it's been eight years for me since I self-harmed and I no longer see my scars as a sad reminder of my own 'depressing past'; they're proof of what I've overcome. With time, I have grown a lot of empathy for the poor kid who was just doing whatever she could to cope with a truly awful situation and I don't want to send the message to other young women that having hard times stops you coming through it and eventually being successful. I'm proud of who I am, and what I went through contributed to making me who I am. For every douche who would judge you for self-harming, there's someone going through the exact same thing who might really appreciate seeing people who have recovered and put this behind them. "

"I have a family member who developed the same kind of dementia - in his case, no-one realised because he lived alone and had always been a heavy drinker. The extent of his mental deterioration only came to light when he had a stroke and people gained access to his flat.

He's been in a care home for the last 7 or 8 years now, his mental and physical health continue to worsen and his behaviour is very challenging. In his case, the day he had the stroke was the last time he ever drank alcohol, because he simply forgot that he'd been a drinker all his life. This is the only reason he's survived so long, in my opinion.

Obviously your mum's case is more complicated and is impacting on the rest of the family. I suggest you read up about Alcoholic Korsakoff Syndrome and see if it sounds like the way your mum is behaving. There are some treatments which can help in the early stages, if that's the condition your mum has. Confabulation is a common symptom, by the way.

You do all need help and support and I suggest you get your equivalent of Social Services involved as soon as possible (as well as your family doctor, as your mum needs assessments and a diagnosis). This isn't a situation you can manage without proper assistance. You say your mum won't consent to rehab - it sounds like you're at the stage when her mental capacity needs to be assessed,to see if she's still capable of making decisions about treatment for herself. It sounds from what you've written that she isn't. I'd agree with you that a care home would be the most appropriate and safest environment for her now.

I wish you all the best, it's a difficult situation to deal with in a close family which is all pulling the same way, let alone when there are other tensions between family members. Take care of yourself and get the professionals involved as soon as possible."
"Real talk: I lost my virginity at 24, to a guy I met on Tinder and dated briefly. He acted ended up ghosting me eventually (like a couple of weeks later I think?) BUT he was very nice about it being my first time. I had done basically nothing beyond kissing and some above the waist touching at that point, but I finally felt ready and I kind of just went for it with a guy I had been dating a short period of time and have no regrets because I don't think I was going to fall in love with him anyway. It wasn't ""magical,"" but it wasn't traumatic either, and it helped build my confidence for future hookups and more dating. 

That said, Tinder can be tricky for this. I would recommend OK Cupid. I met my current bf on there 2 years ago so I'm biased lol. It's so scary, approaching dating when you are less experienced! But no one laughed at me, not when I was a virgin, not when I had only a small amount of sexual experience, not when I was shy on dates. IME most people feel a little bit insecure putting themselves out there and going on dates with strangers and they aren't looking to laugh at you, because they are too busy worrying about all the things they are afraid YOU will laugh at them for!

You will be just fine OP! Good luck!"

"&gt; at best he'll tell me that I don't ""get it"".  Get what exactly? 


What you’re not getting is that *your husband WANTS to be angry and he WANTS to lash out at you/others*. If he can’t find a “real” reason to be angry then *he will make one up*. That’s why you don’t understand why seemingly inoffensive things keep getting blown into a crazy conspiracy against him. **He’s intentionally looking for a reason, wether real or imagined, to get upset so he can verbally abuse you/his family/others.**

This has nothing to do with him reacting to anything- he just wants to let out some steam and he has decided that the people around him (especially you) are the perfect emotional punching bags to do so. 

And his apologies feel like bullshit because *they are bullshit*. He’s not sorry or he would have stoped doing this a long time ago. He’s only saying sorry to placate you/his family to keep you all from leaving him- which would mean he no longer has any emotional punching bags to rage at. 

**He continues to verbally abuse you because he ENJOYS calling you names, hurting your feelings, accusing you of bad intentions, and insulting you. He is not sorry and refuses to change his ways because he likes the status quo of your marriage.**"

To have the conversation, grab some coffee and go for a walk to give yourself a modicum of privacy. There’s no easy way to bring it up, just dive in and tell him exactly what you mean and/or need. 

If the one conversation isn’t enough and he does it again in bed, stop him. Show him or tell him what you want him to do. If he does it again, stop fooling around entirely and let him know it’s not ok for him to keep doing things that you find unpleasant or painful. "

"&gt; at what point does the jealousy become unacceptable?

You passed that point long ago. "
"Agree. My boyfriend and I have been together for seven years. I can hugely empathize with the “please don’t make me plan a wedding” sentiment. It’s so expensive (can’t we use the money toward the down payment on a house?) and there will *absolutely* be family drama. But you know what I DO want? I wanna spend the rest of my life with him! I wanna run off and elope and surprise everyone when we get home. I wanna change my last name and update all my paperwork. Dude, I wanna update our leasing documents and our gym membership and our cat’s vet record. I’m so stoked about *being married to him,* even though a wedding does not excite me. 

OP has none of that. I don’t know that it’s “normal” to not even be a little bit cute with each other. We still get flirty on the reg. I’m not sure fully dreading the wedding is normal either. This sounds like OP is completely checked out of the relationship. She got what she wanted but she doesn’t want it anymore. 

OP, I’m sorry, but if you read this, IAAL. Free info for you: a lawyer I know charges $7,500 for a *basic* divorce with minimal assets and no complications or children. If you go through with this marriage, you better find a way to cut at least that amount from your wedding budget for later :/"

"I think you're kinda right about the replacement girlfriend thing. It's also really weird and unhealthy how he compares the women in his life.

But jokes about secrets your told him in confidence in two separate occasions? At the very least you need to put him on a strict information diet, he clearly cannot keep a secret."
"It sounds like you've put in a lot of effort. I'm sure it's mostly just sheer exhaustion on her part. Two kids that young are so much work and she doesn't get much of a break. 

It's just a tough situation. Hopefully once you're home it'll get better "
"Child support is owed to the custodial parent, not the child. "
"I laughed when I read this:

&gt;many vegan staples are on my no list, like anything with soy, leafy greens, and onion

...because I'm allergic to the whole cabbage tribe: cabbage, kale, radishes, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts...the list goes on and on. Luckily I can eat spinach--but not too much, because roughage makes me sick in large amounts. Sigh."
No but my cousin might as well live at my family's house which is where I stay. He's over here about every weekend during the school year then basically every day in summer
"This is a sad story, and I'm glad that SIL has returned.  No wonder your husband is so ecstatic, in that he thought she was dead.

I wonder if your DH has mentioned his plan to SIL.  Has he actually talked to her about it?

She could have contacted the family over the years, and never did.  **Perhaps she wouldn't want to live with you two**.  Maybe she would actually like to live alone with your assistance.

Your husband needs to sit back and get some perspective on the situation.  He can't just expect her to move in and suddenly be *normal*, no matter how much he wants this to happen.  His sister needs some professional help.

If you do let her come, there needs to be organization and planning.  Perhaps she needs to go to some sort of a half way house for a time to get stabilized.  She would probably benefit from having some sort of job training, employment, or volunteer work lined up, too.  A social worker would help with that.

Maybe it would help to start looking up some community resources for SIL, and then talk to your DH again.  He needs to calm down and take some time to reflect on the situation.


"
You pity and are afraid of her. That is not sympathy. 
"Agreed. He's young and dumb. He might eventually realize his behavior was fucked up, but probably not for 5-10 more years."

"Well, first of all, I would like to see her be evaluated by medical professionals. It's not only her mental state that worries me, but her physical wellbeing, too. I can't imagine that she has eaten properly in 7 years, or seen a doctor this whole time. That's step one. Step two would be addressing any findings of these professionals and continuing treatment for her mental, emotional and physical needs. After that, we could see about housing contingent on professional recommendation and go from there. If she wants to further her education, or learn a job skill, that can be easily arranged."
OP you so entitled to have the opinion you have given that your sister in law is not currently having any kind of treatment. Schizophrenia is such a tragic illness that robs its victims of a grip on reality. At the very least your husband should be getting his sister some form of treatment as he obviously needs to educate himself about his sister's illness and the reality of how careless it is to suggest that his sister come and live with you without any form of medication regime. She will also need some form of substance abuse counselling as any drug or alcohol issues will see her spiral out of control very quickly.  
"I’m not basing this on statistics, and I don’t look at the tits of every woman I see, no. But as a girl in my mid-twenties who has female friends of different ages in different countries, most of them wear bras, no matter the boob size. And I don’t run in conservative circles. Besides, at the risk of sounding pervy, you don’t have to be on the look out for nipples to notice them. "
"I'm not passing any judgement on your personality here, it's pretty impossible to judge what you're like from a Reddit post. However, keep in mind that most nice guys (which you've said is who you're going for) are going to try to avoid hurting your feelings.

""Not feeling a spark"" is a common excuse recommended here on /r/relationships and elsewhere as a polite way to stop dating someone. It doesn't necessarily mean that's your actual problem.
"
Honestly sometimes it’s just easier to say yes... I always give a fake number though 
"We were planning on going out and drinking last night with some friends and honestly, I didn't really want to go out last night.  Today I did want to go out on the river and get some Sun.  

I am out getting a car wash at the moment and going home and we are going to talk.  "
That’s called flirting. Now take her on a real date and see what happens from there. 
"I think a line is crossed when their beliefs start actively impacting the lives of others and, more disturbingly, your own.

It's one thing to ignore the racist ramblings of your grandma when rambling racistly is the worst she does and it doesn't hurt you much personally, or others that you know of. I'm betting it would be another thing to ""ignore"" the racist ramblings when she's directing them at your mixed-race children, or you witness the next Eric Garner happening on her street because she called the cops on a black guy hanging out and she's proud of it.


Also, ""racist grandma is behind on these issues"" is invoked with old people who grew up in a very different racial atmosphere from what exists today. Racist grandma may have grown up under segregation and lynching, and the idea is that ""racist ramblings"" actually constitutes some serious mellowing compared to the racism of that period, and it's really a big change to see someone go through, it would be unreasonable to expect more.


This is not that. OP's parents are not relics of a more racist past, they are completely in tune with a significant and politically powerful current of today's society. That's also why it so happened that their attitudes had an immediate and harmful effect on OP and his girlfriend's lives by the way. Because their beliefs are currently being reflected by the policies of the government, which gives them a power to harm others, and the perception that it's OK for them to do so, that wouldn't have been as big an issue two years ago (Obama's deportation policies were certainly an issue, but from what I understand in the last years of the administration they focused more on deporting people who committed actual crimes and less on apparently benign and generally law-abiding people like OP's GF's parents). That's what made GF's fear of them entirely reasonable and led her to break up with OP.


This was a situation where he *lost a girlfriend he loves* because *his parents were a danger to her own*. That's a very direct and harmful impact of their attitudes on his own life and the ones of people he cares about.


Not saying he should disown them, but he has stronger reasons to do so now than he did before this all went down, when the only impact he perceived their beliefs as having was being annoying to listen to for him."
"I think this is likely it. I also wonder if something like anxiety could be playing a role, here. Sometimes it causes you to fix on minor or immaterial things.

OP, I'd encourage him to talk more about this So he can try to get his feelings sorted out about why it matters to him."
Depends on what's on their registry. Is it all $50-100? I think it's asinine to try and match what they spent per head on a gift. 
"&gt; He wanted me and if he divulged how cowardly and untrustworthy he is, I'd have never married him.

this is a clear signal to run for the hills."
"There's something truly off if they think this is remotely funny. I could sympathize with Amy (but not condone the affair), but it's bizarre and cruel to think there's anything funny about this."
"""Top 8"" ha ha ha, damn I miss MySpace."
"AFAIK he hasn't cheated with her or anyone since our relationship began. But they seem unable to break contact with one another so how in hell do I know she wasn't ""visiting family"" holed up in a hotel for a week and he was meeting her after work?"

"Does your wife act the same way?  If not, I can't for the life of me even imagine why she might want to spend time with those women.  And all that spending the night stuff, from grown women, is bullshit.  My friends and I quit having sleep-overs by our 20's.  Something is up."
"I actually just realized: she told me that he travelled a few times (unlike in your case, he was travelling in the workdays and coming back for the weekends).

Yeah, it might be worse than I thought."
"Nah, i don’t really agree with this. I don’t wear a bra. I’ve never had anyone comment on it, ever. Maybe they do judge, but only to the lightest degree, to the point where i’ve never felt treated differently by people. I’m living in the deep south. People would totally let you know they’re not okay with that choice of yours. 


There’s a big difference between people around you thinking “that’s a bit odd” and getting over it (which i’ll assure you is how most of the population reacts) verses your mom constantly commenting on a mostly innocuous lifestyle choice. It’s like if she dyed her hair to a color her mom didn’t like. Is it fair for her to be essentially be bullied by her mother over it? I think not. "
"OP needs to get clear on this. Inheritance, or prior assets are not community property. Income earned DURING the marriage is, and if she's hiding that from him it's definitely a problem.

That's probably how I'd address it, I'd make it very clear I'm not trying to take her $1.5m, but if she works for a salary and I have no idea what that salary is or where it goes, that's not legal and is unfair. Also it opens her $1.5m to risk. "
You know with all the secrets coming out due to Ancestry and 23andMe testing I think they're probably going to find out sooner than later.
"Like I said, I think the STI/STD thing isn't a fair thing to mad at Amy about because it's Jim who didn't disclose his past with her to you, and it's Jim who potentially exposed you to infections through his choices.  Amy has no obligation to you.  Your husband has a lot.

It's also really REALLY weird that Amy messaged him that.  Even if he's been faithful to you for the entirety of your relationship, her even jokingly wishing him a happy Father's Day shows a lack of remorse for her actions, and a continued desire to remain close to your husband.  And your husband doesn't seem to be shutting that shit down, so it doesn't seem like he's done with her yet.

And honestly?  I'd doubt his story about him bowing out because he didn't want to blow up a family, and be more inclined to believe he got tired of waiting for Amy to leave her supposedly abusive situation so he tried to move on.  I don't want to heap more pain on your shoulders, but I think it's important for you to consider you may have been his ""rebound"" from this woman.  Or worse, an attempt to make her jealous enough to force her to finally break it off with her husband.

I'm so sorry you're going through this.  Please protect yourself, and definitely consider individual therapy to help you process all the bullshit Jim's now heaped at your doorstep."
"To all the girls saying that you feel pressured to give a real number. Get a app like Textplus where you can have a number specifically to give these creepy dudes and if they don't believe you it's real have the text your phone and reply saying it's you.

That way you don't risk them having your phone number that's most likely linked to your social media, and they can't screw around and post it on somewhere online when you blow them off."
"Honestly, smart open men don't mind heavy topics. I like a girl who can tickle my brain from the start and just forces me to bring my mental A game. This is not the reason for the likely missing spark."
"Maybe make a more realistic timeline of when you guys will amass the downpayment you want.  Being mad at someone for buying a single roll of paper towels means your goal time frame isn’t realistic. Threatening to disconnect the compressor on your partner’s car after a weird fight over her choosing to sit in a hot car instead of turning the car on bc you fight about pennies wasted so often? Yeah, maybe adjust the timeline and be more realistic before one of you snaps and murders the other person with a saved spork from Taco Bell. "
"careful with the compromise you might reach. not being able to give her number to her away from pushy guys might put her in danger. bar guys don’t like being told no, and bouncers don’t give a shit. "
"I’ll probably get downvoted for this, but a $100 gift for a black tie wedding is cheap. Generally speaking, while you should absolutely spend no more than you’re comfortable parting with, the amount of money the couple is spending to host you and celebrate with them should be taken into consideration when purchasing a gift. It’s not a tit-for-tat, but a black tie wedding could easily cost the couple $500 per person or per couple.

Want to reiterate that I’m not saying anyone MUST match the dollar amount, but it’s a recommended/traditional way to gauge how much investment you put into your gift. With that said, because it’s a destination wedding, you can definitely reduce the amount spent on the gift. "

"""I asked him if he thought I wasn't as good as him, and asked if he thought I wasn't that special.""

""So this adds insult to injury because this makes me feel that he thinks that he might be better??""

What? Literally nothing that he said makes me think that he thinks that hes better than you. Both of you need to grow up. This is the true petty part, when I read something like that, it makes me think the poster is a teenager. That is incredibly immature.

 Sure, dad/husband could be a bit less of a jerk about it, but don't tell me that you wouldn't feel even the *slightest* bit left out if the situation was reversed."

"Yes, this is unfortunately common.  Leaving an abuser can be dangerous, so you are right to take your instinct seriously.  However, abusers rarely have as much power as they lead their victims to believe.  They bank on your fear as it is what gives them the power. 

Don't tell him.  Just leave.  You do not need to do this face to face.  Like the other person said, let him know that you will immediately call the police if he threatens you.  

Be prepared for him to go back and forth between saying everything he possibly can to make you feel worthless and horrible, then back to apologizing and begging you to come back.  Seriously, be mentally prepared for this and know that neither story is true.  It's just what Cluster-B abusers tend to do when they feel like they are no longer in control. It's expected. 

Tell people that you trust.  Even someone at work, especially if your work has any sort of security.  I know it sucks telling people your business, but it's worth it for your safety.  Most likely, he won't try anything, but you need to be vigilant.  

Do not be afraid to call the police.  That is what they are there for.  Don't let fear of him hurting you keep you in this relationship.   Just tell the people you trust what is going on and keep you phone and pepper spray on you at all times for a few weeks."
"Have you talked to his parents or your own about his behavior? I'd start there, and make it clear you're not going to be sexually harassed by a child in your family home."
"Better said that I could. 

But 75ayla is right here. Parents passing is one of the deepest moments in life... one of lifes most heartbreaking moments. 

If he isn't there for you now... he will never be. Maybe don't break up, but I wouldn't consider moving this relationship along without his actions changing heavily. "
"Yes. I think OP is right to be concerned, but after reading her post, I’m much more inclined to agree with her husband’s POV. OP does not sound like a particularly nice person. "
"There is only one opportunity to go to the wedding and many opportunities to go on a trip with friends. 
I think the wedding wins and your cousins would be so happy and thankful that you came to support. 
Plus you will look like a standup guy/girl If you told your friends that family comes over fun trips with them. They will understand and see your loyalty. 
Good luck. 
Also, the years and years of trying to cover up the trip to your family sounds like a royal headache. "
"It’s the liquor, randy"

"I think you handle it by talking to Sasha's dad and any adults that are on that side of his family.     

Your mother has been putting her needs ahead of her child's for too long.  It is time for the rest of the adults in the family to do what your mother will not do, to put Sasha's needs first.  It is not right to make a 13-year-old responsible for his mother's day-to-day needs.  You say she can't go to the toilet on her own.  That means Sasha is doing it.  Do you think it is right to have a 13-year-old helping his mother to the toilet multiple times a day?

I think you know what's right already.  Step in and advocate for Sasha.   Start out by giving Sasha a phone of his own and telling him he can call you to talk any time he wants to."
"Call the cops on older sister if you see stuff like that, too."
He's emotionally abusive. Run. Now.
Firing someone because you had a relationship with her ages ago in college is a bad thing to do to someone and could create drama in your workplace.

Have you considered that the people that are coming aboard your department are going to dislike you because of your actions toward their former coworker?
you should apologise to your cousin... for their bad parenting.

Stop acting like you don’t know the implication"
"That's sad. You shouldn't have had to bribe them to come to your graduation. And it's rather disheartening that you were expected to skip college and possibly not graduate high school just to be a house servant. And let's be honest, you are considered a servant by your parents. Every comment and post you've put up gives more credence to that theory. This is a bad thing. I think time away from your parents is going to do you some good, OP. "
"&gt; she's a grown adult and I was her fiancée (gosh that past tense feels lovely, I could sing it from a mountaintop seriously though

I’ve said this already, but your responses are screaming that you just plain didn’t want to be with her any more and you chose the tattoo as a pretext to dump her. 
"
"I also think you should be (kindly) honest with him. 

Tell your boyfriend that when he asked you if you liked his new haircut/shave you felt like you had to lie not to hurt his feelings. But now you've thought about it you've decided you want to be honest with him. Tell him you are *really* into facial hair. Tell him that facial hair is your number one physical turn on and almost every time you see a guy and find him hot he has facial hair. You love your boyfriend for who he is as a person far more then his hair, and you were afraid if you told him it would be controlling, but you miss his sexy beard. 

Look, my husband prefers woman with long hair. Knowing that I wouldn't cut it all off down to a pixie cut because I do care about him finding me cute. I know he prefers dresses/skirts and I wear jeans 90% of the time so it's not like I make every decision for him; but something like that I'd want to know. It is going to be worse for your boyfriend if you aren't as into him and he has no idea why or way to fix it. "
"I agree it seems he wanted to have an easy as possible fathers day with a daughter he doesn't see all that often and doesn't get enough quality time with. I think it's also important to note that she doesn't live there and isn't a member of that household, in that respect I think she should be treated as a guest (regardless of her age), if OP had a problem with other guests doing those same behaviours and would tell them to stop then that's fine. 

"
"If he's going to cheat, it probably won't be with your roommates. It's way too difficult to sneak around in that kind of situation, IMO, and if the girls have any common sense, they don't want to invite that kind of drama into their living situation.

That said, his desire to ""experience other things"" is something you need to talk about. "
"Basically in the U.K. and Europe I think at 16 you can drink with adult supervision (like at a pub with a meal or in your home) but the brother is a major twat

"As someone who drinks but doesn't do drugs, I actually don't think the comparison is unreasonable. Both are addictive and can cause people to act in damaging ways and do things they never ordinarily would. They aren't exactly the same, but alcohol is taboo for OP's husband in the way that cocaine is taboo for most non-users."
"&gt; So how do you remember you both decided to put them there if you don't even remember how they got there?

Yay logic bomb"
"you've discussed it with her once and you think you've given her enough information to write a book? you've discussed it with her only once and you think you've ""faced it""? you still need some help through this. "
I wish I had read something like that when I had my breakup. I was way too hard on myself and ended up going through a lot more trouble than I needed to because of it. I have trouble seizing the day.
"Three things:

You explain what you wear, not 100% sure, but the thing to ask is if you'd wear the same thing if your friends were over/her friends were over (of any sexuality), if yes then it doesn't matter.

You should learn to control yourself, just because an attractive person hits on you it doesn't make it morally right.  And you're setting yourself up to sleep with your sisters SO.

Lastly, stop talking to her when you know what she's doing.  And you know.  Delete her from Snapchat and other messaging, if she doesnt stop tell her you don't feel comfortable with those images."
"I know that this is the party line at reddit, but it is, if you think about it, a bizarre belief.  We would not say that a person's past has nothing to do with who they are now in any other arena, but somehow sex is the one exception.  Nothing that a person has done sexually has anything at all to do with who they are now. /s"
"In this scenario, I'm basically worried about two things:

**1. If my sister follows through on her threat, are my kids going to be taken away from me because social services thinks I'm a neglectful parent?**

I sure hope you're not using drugs, in which case this is probably not a problem. I would just make sure that I have my house in order in case the worst comes to pass.

**2. Do my sister's irrational fears have so much control over her that she might try to take my children away from me?**

If you think that's a possibility, it's time to play defense. That probably means some kind of restraining order. This is worth consulting with a lawyer about, IMO. A restraining order means she can't come harass you at your house and can't have contact with your kids; otherwise, you can call the cops and have her arrested. 

**If neither of those are concerns,** then you can worry about some more mundane things.

First, especially if she's pulled shit like this before -- and honestly, I'd be surprised if she hadn't, but there's a first for everything -- she's officially out of my life. Maybe I tell her, maybe I don't. If it makes sense, consider moving. Seriously. If this seems like an overreaction, think for a second about what she's doing: at best, she's trying to blackmail you socially to manipulate how you parent your children. That's not somebody I want in my life. Period.

If you're willing to give her another chance, then I'd make it clear that she doesn't get to tell lies about you, and if she does, you're going to cut her out. I'd also make it clear that your parenting decisions are not up for discussion. She can think whatever she wants to, but it's not up to her. You don't need to justify, argue, defend, or explain. If that topic comes up, you can choose to listen, but I'd just cut it off. She also isn't going to get unsupervised time with my kids.

Either way, I'd have a quick discussion with my kids to let me know if Aunt Crazyface talks to them when I'm not there, especially if she says not to tell you. Remind them that you're their dad, and you say that they can tell you anything no matter what another adult says. Check up on this regularly. 

With respect to your parents, it's a judgment call for you. If they were my parents (as in the two individuals who raised me) I'd be on the phone yesterday telling them what's going on so they know not to trust whatever your sister tells them at this point. But they might be all too eager to lap up her bullshit, in which case maybe you don't want to bother with it."
"It's a LOT worse that you thought/think. I think you are just in denial because you love her and *want* to believe her - and that she loves you back and all this BS she's throwing your way is true. But it's not.

She's cheated on her marriage for 3.5 years, lied to you the *entire* time and went to great lengths in order to do so. No one who really 'loves' someone does this to them. She doesn't love you, she doesn't love her husband. She is selfish and trying to come up with any excuses she can to keep you on the line - *not* because she loves you, but because she's selfish and doesn't want to give up having her cake and eating it, too. 

I am really sorry - because it must hurt to find out someone you *do* love has betrayed and lied to you. But please don't let those emotions override the truth - she's used you all these years, just as she's used her husband. She is a liar and a cheater and will say whatever she thinks will keep you waiting on her. This is not a good person or someone who deserves your time or your love.

You deserve someone who loves you, wants you and is free to make a life and build a future with you out of LOVE and mutual TRUST and RESPECT. NONE of which you have with this selfish person. I'm so sorry - really do deserve better. But you will only have it if you walk away and open the door to someone who can love you like that."
"But there's often no way to tell because mad quickly leads to violent. I am a man and I have been attacked by one of those creeps. Stalked me and a girl out of a bar because she was ""his"" - he had seen her first. Didnt take his eyes off of me all night inside the bar so I was prepared. The physical escalation did shock me a little."
"I'm so happy you said this. I've been reading his comments this way too but wasn't sure if I was being sensitive (lol @ OP -- look, you've even got me feeling anxious! Help your fudging wife like a husband should)"
"I get what you’re saying, I grew up in the Mormon church. But if he is still religiously committed, it would be a big big deal. "
"Have some self-respect.

Love (real, actual love, as opposed to juvenile infatuation) comes from having a deep and intimate respect for a person as you have come to know him/her over the years.

Can you say this, with real conviction, out loud to yourself:

""I love and cherish and deeply respect her for the fact that she chose to be unfaithful to me, not once, which could be chalked up to a mistake, but several time with the same person, even while lying to my face about being willing to work on things to make our relationship stronger"".

Can you do that?  Can you say it, actually out loud to yourself, without hearing *any* doubt at all as to whether you mean it?

Because if you can, then by all means, pursue her, because you're the perfect guy for her.

But if you *can't* say that without wincing, then what you feel for her is not the love upon which relationships are built; what you feel for her is the fear of not having *someone*, which we call ""love"" in order to make us feel better about the huge mistake we're pursuing."
How about you stop acting like every relationship you have is going to end up the same way. You're projecting. It's not healthy. 
I don't think out to lunch with family is an unreasonable time to ask him to take the kid. Gym too even if they have child care. 
"Reminds me of that episode of Friends...
Pretty weird, gotta say."
Fuck man... You give your life for others being a firefighter one day you might not come back because of your job. And she doing this? That sucks that really fucking sucks. Sorry your going through this. 
"Ah shit, it's way too easy..... I apologise OP but.

You dad is just worried people won't know which one of them is the dad. "
"Honestly I hope that's the case since I really, really, REALLY.. Don't want my cousin attracted to me. It's gross. Not to mention I'm very happy with my partner and he sees it as weird but he kinda gets it in a way. "
"It made me feel old too, and it also really really reminded me why 18 year olds are so vulnerable to being completely taken advantage of by older adults, like we seeing here all the damn time.

Good luck OP! My personal advice would be to take the plunge by offering a kiss rather than a bj. I also think you should only go this route if you are prepared for it to become a romantic relationship. "
"You go back to the doctor, you don't expect your husband to do something he is uncomfortable with.  You have changed.  You need to figure it out."
You can’t say you support her choice when you broke up with her for it. 
"I'm sorry, but it says a lot about YOUR character that you would stay friends with a man like this. By remaining friends, you are complicit of his actions, as you are silently endorsing them. When you are friends with someone who doesn't respect women, you are friends with someone who doesn't respect your mother. Think about that. 

I'm sorry, but people like you ARE part of the problem that women face today.

"I am so, so sorry this happened to you. It was not you lacking boundaries that was the problem, you were raped and it wasn't your fault in any way. I am glad things are better for you. You sound like a good person helping out that new gf (even if she ignored you, you still planted a seed she can pay attention to in the future.)"
He just wants no condom sex. You need to tell him that is not happening again and discuss whether to keep the FWB thing going now. It’s all fun and games until he tries to “oops” you because he feels better 
They aren't in a position to have her stay with them and they don't want her staying with them.  The girl is in a position of her own making because she didn't plan properly.  It's not their job to make themselves uncomfortable to get her out of it.   
ugh. You gotta report her. or tell her OBGYN about the meth.

"It's not OK that your dad excuses your uncles behavior with ""at least he's not a pedofile"" or ""lots of men sexually harass their nieces"", so please don't think your dad's ""advice"" comes from a good place.

And my friend wasn’t allowed to hang out all summer. Turns out they were “experimenting” with each other and she got pregnant in the name of science. She was smoking hot too, what a mindfuck. I personally think children shouldn’t spoon or whatever once puberty hits"

What if he hired a company or one of his friends to make a call ,because he didn't want to be responsible for hurting you. This sounds like a set up ,and you know what the fact that he was so quick to break up with you makes me think he's in on this.

"It's *exactly* what happened here actually. 

Except his wife who overheard it told people about it. They weren't posting it on facebook or shouting it from rooftops for everyone to hear. It was a joke between him and his friends. That's it."
"It probably won’t be forever and it probably isn’t something you can just up and stop.

I’ve only ever moved in with one person (my wife) and it was definitely like this at first.

I think it’s normal, two people coming together and figuring out how to compromise. It’s definitely different once you actually move in together. Just takes time to work itself out.

Important thing is you both give each other space and neither of you say anything you’ll regret. Easier said than done."
"You shouldn’t have to use your strength to push your partner off of you. 

My ex and I were very kinky. We had safewords. There was ONE time he walked right up to the edge of my boundaries and it was because he spat on my bits to get me wet instead of eating me out. I laughed and was like ok I can’t do this seriously. Because I was laughing my ass off he didn’t take me seriously and kept going. I stopped laughing and looked him in the eyes and said “I said no.”

There was no repeated “stop” there was no me having to push him off, he apologized profusely, felt awful and stopped. He apologized multiple times and it came down to a misread of body language which is ok. 

That’s not what happened with you. That’s waltzing right over your boundaries and pissing on them "
"I’m going to preface this advice by saying that I have anxiety and I’ve lived with roommates who were total strangers at first and who didn’t always turn into friends.

If she’s following all agreed upon rules, not stealing your things, and not being too loud/taking up more than agreed upon space/etc, then I think you need to accept that not all roommates are friends and that a lot of this stems from your own anxiety.

You’re not her friend and you’re not her mom, and while it’s good to care about others, she doesn’t want that care from you. If she hasn’t brought friends over yet, then go ahead and keep on keeping on. If you’re concerned, get a small safe for your jewelry, important documents, etc., and make sure you have renter’s insurance if this is apartment style housing. It’s ok to just be roommates, and as long as she isn’t openly hostile (calling you rude names, never answering questions pertaining to your immediate living situation, trashing the place), then she’s not a bad roommate necessarily, she’s just not a friendly person.

If your anxiety is so much that you can’t function, then you need to see a professional and follow their recommendation for how to proceed."
"Well now you no longer need to give him the benefit of the doubt. He is openly creepy, doesn’t respect the word “no,” and will get nasty when met with reasonable boundaries. He knows *exactly* what he’s doing - no “awkward cluelessness” here. 

I’m guessing your friend thought you might be a “good influence” on him, or figured he’d treat you with more respect since you’re a friend of hers. I’d hate to think she knew he’d treat you like this and knowingly threw you under the bus, but we’ll find out when you show her the texts he’s been sending. "
I would not consider lunch a date. Dinner or drinks yes. She may not even realize you had romantic intentions.
"If he's self-aware enough to acknowledge it and joke about it, it's not like he can't help it or at least make an effort to stop."
"Yeah, that isn't healthy; mentalities like that should be confined to /r/braincels."
"And just to add to this, OP has already paid her out and is ready to move on. Feelings linger, but this ship has sunk."
"That is good. I'm not saying all 20-27 relationships are doomed to fail, and it surely can work out, but in your case it already looks sketchy, you know? 

From my experience, people who choose to cheat, will never change unless they work really really hard on themselves and truly grasp what they did was wrong.

Cheating is always a choice. Grey areas are being highly irresponsible with alcohol or drugs, but even then, cheating is on the cheater in my opinion. 

And I think the girl will excuse her behavior with 'but my ex did too' instead of working on her character. All the while enjoying your attention and using you as a distraction from the mess her life is atm. Not saying she does it intentionally, which is why the whole situation is so difficult, but it sounds like she is using you as an emotional crutch. "
"Watch porn together at some point, maybe? But she's said no, and all the best bedroom stuff needs enthusiastic consent, so if you want to preserve the relationship, it might be worth approaching this another time in a different fashion other than ""i want to try new things because this isn't progressing enough and I want to keep up with my co-workers and their conversation"". 

I mean, I'd be happy experimenting in the bedroom with a boyfriend who wanted to *enjoy more stuff* ***with me*** than just because he wants to *enjoy more stuff*. The difference imo is pretty marked. "
"Her side is that he was able to walk away and find happiness somewhere else. She's the type of person to want people to beg for her attention, and apparently, she isn't getting that from him."
"To be fair, the age gap by itself doesn't necessarily mean bad things [for full disclosure, I'm in my mid-40's and just married a woman who's 32]. In my view, the big thing is making sure that there isn't a big power imbalance - like, does the younger person have some experience in the world, do they have earning potential to support themselves if the relationship craps out, can they stand up for themselves, etc.

Anyways, it's a much bigger deal to me to see someone 10+ years older dating someone who's in their early 20's or younger. But in this case, regardless of age, it's clear that OP's boyfriend is totally pushing her around and manipulating her."
"Normally I'm a rational and careful person.. But when i met my partner  i fell in love with him almost instantly, and we moved in together in less than a month...which is absolutely mental and something i don't go around recommending. but it worked, it still works, 12 years later and we're still together. still incredibly happy. he's coming home from work in twenty minutes and I have butterflies because I miss him and I'm excited to see him...go for it!"
"This is my first thought as well! Also from OP's boyfriend's perspective, how can you be best friend with someone who disinvites you to their birthday party year after year because a girl you dated for 3 months 12 years ago was ""uncomfortable."" I would not maintain a close friendship with such a person. "
Your right. End it now.  
"I feel this is a bit of a stretch... just because someone doesn't speak the others love language doesn't mean he is a bad person. What is he really supposed to do? 

Logical people are different than emotional people. Emotional people want you to sit there and rub their back and bring them water and hold a wash cloth to their head. Logical people think ""you're going to throw up whether or not I'm here. I might as well keep doing what I'm doing."" My boyfriend is logical and he is never there for me when I'm sick. But I wouldn't call him a bad person for this. Just... different than I."

"Oh my god. This made me really sad for you. Why are you doing this? I mean, I know you're intertwined in his life...sunk cost fallacy and all that. ...but can you imagine spending your life with this man? I can't imagine waring my life with someone so awful. And that's how you described him."

He is being honest.    Communication problems are obvious deal breakers.  My fiance and I almost broke up over the exact same communication you guys are having.  We have been going to therapy for 5 months and it has worked wonders.     From what you are explaining it sounds like he has hit rock bottom emotionally.    He's probably being honest and you need to carefully listen to him.   
"I disagree. I have a dodgy stomach complaint and there are foods that make me ill. I try to avoid them most of the time but if I go out to a restaurant or have dinner with family, then I do eat them regardless of how I will react to them because I enjoy the food. It sounds ridiculous to most and not many people understand, because if eating a pizza gives me 3 hours of sweats , stomach cramp, sickness and diarrhea then why would I want to eat it? The honest answer is because it tastes good and I love pizza, I miss eating it and I'm willing endure the inconveniences every now and then to eat the food I love.

I have been checked by the doctor and everything is fine. I just can't eat certain stuff. "
"Well, no, they *can* keep going out, but their lifestyle needs to change to accommodate a kid. Being a parent means at least some sacrifice."
Agreed with both of these points!
"So what do you expect? Nothing will change till any steps are taken. Do the hard work and get rid of this Sara. What's important here? Sara or your wife? Once you choose, it'll be easier.

"It's up to them what parenting style they want for their daughter. Having family time all the time except for special occasions doesn't sound typical or even realistic/desireable for everybody. 

Having a nanny and scheduling time both with and without your kid isn't ""putting family last""! I also feel you overlook all the small everyday moments this family shares that shouldn't be ignored. Not every family needs a grand group outing every weekend.

Growing up I honestly hated the contrived family outings. I much rather preferred simpler one-on-one bonding time for weekends since I lived with both parents every day otherwise."
"This seems toxic as fuck.  You are not a therapy tool and you don't owe her closure.  Personally, I think you should let this friendship go.  I don't think there was ever a normal to get back to in the first place."
"Yeah this guy sounds like my son who just graduated from college. He is only 21 but he is feeling this pressure that this is the only time in his life he is going to have to ""adventure"" and he is making the most of it. He even decided to go to grad school because he isn't ready to work at a ""real"" job.

"Her ""actions"" are literally doing nothing. You are upset at her for literally not being there. Not saying things to you. Having friends that you've never met."

"Thank you for this. I think it's totally plausible. His friend is a lot older than us, fit, good looking, single for a long time, and has no interest in women from what I gather. But I don't know the guy and he's been nothing but nice to me. He is definitely a big part of my bf's life. 

Regarding my ex not being over me. This is exactly where my mind first went. What doesn't make sense is why the caller would give his name if he didn't want this coming back to him. And if it was one of my ex's friends then they would know this would create drama for him. We live on opposite sides of the country and I feel he would want me to be happy if anything. 

You are correct though. Someone around me is a sociopath. It's made me a very ugly person because I no longer trust anyone in my life. Anyone could be doing this."
"&gt;What made her think that its appropriate to go for drinks with an ex? I'd never even consider doing something like that.

Because other people aren't clones of you, OP. Some people keep in contact with exes, some people don't.

[removed]
Totally could happen. I just didnt want her to ignore the fact that it could ruin their friendship.  Whether or not it’s worth the risk or reward is a difficult decision she’ll have to make.  I just wish someone had offered me the same advice when I was her age. 😬
"oh god. i really didn't see that..  explains why he was so triggered at simple question regarding his future, in his mind, he had already secured his future.

"I don’t buy that. How many people discuss their problems with their friends or family and they suggest “you should get a child support order in place” or “you should get a parenting time order in place”?

I have a hard time believing casual vague suggestions is practicing law. Otherwise literally everyone who ever gives family and friends advice has “practiced law.”

I don’t think a bar association expects everyone ever to say “I can’t answer that. Sorry about your problems. Get an attorney” and to say no more."

"I’m still not wholly convinced this dude is all that. If you’re set on not leaving him you need to sit him down and explain the extent of your anxiety about his driving. Ask him to be respectful of your fears and to drive safer with you in the car. He may be 100% confident in his asshole driving abilities but he CANNOT predict what other people are going to do on the road. He is regularly putting you in increased danger on the road. It’s not okay. And if he can’t have a conversation about it, that shows that he doesn’t care about your feelings as much as you think he does. "

"If she is being honest about her description of events, she needs your support right now, because it sounds like she was sexually assaulted. Yes, she made some questionable choices here, but again, if someone did take advantage of her when she was 'blacked out', this incident should be categorized as sexual assault - not infidelity."
"End the friendship. Distance yourself, move out when the lease ends or as soon as possible, don't speak to her again once you leave. Don't bother arguing or explaining - she doesn't deserve it and it doesn't sound like she gives a damn. You need to treat her like she treated that dog (I mean ignore her, don't kill her!), and keep that in mind.

I had to end a friendship with someone who adopted a cat from someone that made her sign an agreement that included no declawing. She went to a separate vet out of state to get it declawed because ""her furniture was too important"", and then when the cat had severe behavioral problems dumped it back on a different shelter and told the original owner that the cat had been killed by a car when they did a checkup.

I thought she was a good person, but actions like that say everything they need to. You don't owe her anything now, and let your anger get you away from her."
I think every serious couple should do couple's counseling. I wish I could get my bf to agree to it.
"I mean, let's be serious--a lot of people have bad childhoods, and if you are in an environment where there's a lot of poverty and other stuff that can contribute to bad childhoods, most of the people you meet are probably going to have bad childhoods in one way or another.

But it's also true that the ideal state is ending up with someone who ""gets"" us, and if you had a bad childhood, the people most likely to get you are people who have similar or comparable experiences.

I think therapy would be a great idea just in general if you had a rough upbringing but I don't think that having dated people with bad childhoods makes that necessary."
"When you ask him to stop doing something hurtful and he attacks your sensitivity and says cruel things.  That is abuse and not related tp ADD.   That is gaslighting.   Cruelty, verbal abuse and cutting down your character are not signs of ADD.  Someone with anger and impulse issues related to ADD still have the ability to recognize they are being that way and to apologize.  He is choosing not to.

Check out loveisrespect and do their checklist."
"Unfortunately it's still common for guys to objectify and judge women by their appearance while guys seem to get a free pass and can wear the same few outfits over and over again. I cant even tell you how many times my husband and I will be out and see two people out on a date where the woman is all dressed up and the guys in like a t-shirt and flip flops and for some reason that's just how it goes? 

Maybe you can mention to your bf that youre always trying to work on yourself but there are things that you are insecure about and would love his support in getting you both to where you want to be. You with loving your look and getting your PhD and him with whatever it is he does, maybe ditching the his school wardrone, eh? Maybe you guys could meal prep and work out together? It'll definitely won't hurt your anxiety and energy levels. "
She didn't go to college. 24 should have been about 6-8 years of working experience already. 
"That’s awesome, tbh. Given all you guys do, I think firefighters *should* make a livable wage. "
"She has brought up the phrase ""you don't love me so why should I even live?""

"Yeah, those are my thoughts as well. Lots of local donation places near me require you to be within the healthy BMI range, have at least a college education-preferably at a notable school, to be a certain height, and to complete a psychological screening. My guess is that being trans may lead to immediate rejection. Egg donors near me can earn up to $40K, so the clinics can be as picky as they want. 

Plus, the whole process can take up to five months and requires at least bi-monthly visits to the clinic. I don't know how far from the States OP lives, but it seems unlikely he'd make much profit if he had to take 10 round-trip planes with over-night stays, etc. "
"do you think she would want you to stay with her out of pity?

probably not, so respect her. Don't make this choice for her. You want to break up so do it."
"He’s probably deeply embarrassed by it. There are other ways to be sensual, intimate and share a sexual connection other than just boning it out for the orgasm. 

It’s probably an overshare but I have cancer and even if I felt like having sex (nothing says sexy like chemo—blergh), I medically cannot. This is unfortunate for my wonderful husband.

We still cuddle and stuff. There are ways to build intimacy without sex. 

If I were you, I would gently bring up the topic from the point of view of concern. Obviously he’s expressed to you already he’s had sexual issues in the past. Suggest a few things maybe like massage, foreplay, just plain fooling around hanky panky like innocent butt grabs and dirty words. Maybe it’s just cuddling during a movie. Ask what would make him feel more comfortable, how he wants to address the problems because you want him to be happy and fulfilled, just as much as you want that for yourself. 

Not an easy convo for sure, "
"This sounds horrible for you. You aren't into it, have self-confidence issues, and have no want to go out looking for other girls. There's no reason for you to go through with this unless you're pathetic, can't attract any other women, and are willing to settle for half a relationship.

Also, offering you a threesome then using that as justification for an open relationship is classic manipulation. She and her friend manipulated you into thinking this demand of hers is fair when it's not.

Do a little search here too and you'll find that opening previously monogamous relationships is almost always bad for the guy (and especially bad for guys that don't like going out much). There aren't that many girls that want to hook up with someone in a relationship but there's a never ending supply of guys that will be happy to pump a load into your gf then send her home to you. She'll be out every weekend and you'll be home alone masturbating.

"
"Um, yeah.  Read that bit.  But it doesn't matter.  It boils down to this: Sister is happy.  OP is not.  "
"We’ve been together almost 1.5 years. We met through friends and I’m not “out” so it was probably a surprise to her when I told her I’m bi early on in the relationship.

"&gt;Who expresses more than a casual interest in my passions and possibly share a few

This is unreasonable. I'm assuming by this that you mean you're hoping to share passions with a friend (reasonable) but that if you don't share any, you want them to take more than a casual interest in your passions, which they don't share? That's too much to ask of a friend. You can't expect people to be deeply emotionally invested in *your* passion. My friends listen and express interest in my passions, that's it. They hear me out, engage in conversation, and ask questions, but why would they express anything more than a casual interest? They *are* only casually interested.

I've only ever had a family member or romantic partner actually seem to be deeply interested in my passions, and even then...I'm not offended if they don't. You can't expect people to be passionate about *your* passion. It's yours. It sounds like you are asking for a lot from a friend."

Op, this commenter is totally right. Unless this guy wakes up a super model every day, he has zero right to criticize you.

"Your boyfriend might have ADD but he is ALSO abusive.  ADD does not cause someone to be abusive.  Abuse is a choice.  My husband has ADD hyperfocus, and while it has caused frustration and sometimes made me feel unloved at times, it has not made him abusive.

"Adults groom children for sexual abuse.

OPs wife was being naive and dumb at best, or an active participant in an emotional affair at worst.  OPs wife wasn't being groomed.

In retrospect, she should have had the sense to shut down her BILs inappropriate conversations about *her sister and their relationship* immediately.  But she didn't, and here we are.

This is a huge clusterfuck that *will* absolutely blow up, and damage everyone's relationships.  It's a matter of when, not if.

I have no idea what the solution is to minimize the fallout, but I guarantee you that sister already knows something is up, and that she's not going to be happy about the role her sister played in all of this.  

I guarantee you that OPs wife knows her sister knows something's up, and that's why wife is pushing OP to act like nothing ever happened; she's projecting her fears on to her husband thinking of they all just pretend nothing happened this dirty little secret won't see the light of day.

And I guarantee you that BIL knows his wife knows something is up, and that's why he was so adamant with OPs wife to keep it quiet.

I think OP needs to let his wife know that he's not going to have a huge public confrontation with BIL, but he's going to maintain the boundaries he already set up, and SIL starts asking questions too damn bad.  OP will direct her to talk to her sister.  And I think OP needs to tell his wife that she needs to talk to her sister sooner rather than later.  But they both need to be prepared that their relationship with her sister is likely going to be over."
Bingo on this. Her friend was waving her insecurity flag big time there.
Harsh?  I understand not telling someone on a first date that you have a terminal illness.  But three fucking years?  Then on the day he proposes rather than fess up you tell him no?  That is so selfish and heartless.
"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Yes, you should have told him...but I'm sure you know that. I also think that people don't necessarily realize how much this kind of diagnosis can fuck a person up. 

I know someone whose parent had Huntingtons. She had no symptoms, but wanted a definite answer before settling down and having babies. In order to be allowed to do genetic testing, she had to go through a full year of counselling to ensure that she would be psychologically able to handle the news. In general, doctors are so careful to give patients as much information and autonomy as possible...so for them to be this controlling about a diagnosis, I have to assume that this news has sent a lot of people over the edge in a really dangerous way. "
"Still emotionally manipulative. Although it sucks, her actions (being in accidents, not having savings) have consequences. Taking a (presumably) low paying internship isn't in the cards for her at this point if she can't afford it. That is not your fault.

She's right, though, that this is a nine year long serious relationship and sometimes a partner must sacrifice for the other.

I think, depending on how she treats her finances, you should have a nice long discussion about your expectations ($ contribution, communication). At the end of the day, if you choose to take her on, you can cancel her policy at any time. 

I would also heartily encourage you to get quotes from every car insurer around. My rate differed by $1000 among companies."
"People don't really charge for that stuff in Ireland. They obviously can, but they don't "
"&gt; So if you had kids it's possible a treatment/cure will be developed.

Anything is possible, but I believe it's irresponsible to intentionally bring children into the world knowing there's a high chance they will have a painful, terminal illness."
He has a serious man-job and doesn't want to compromise his career prospects...
"When does your actual boss come back? They may be able to help you. 

And for when he tags along on your errands so he can show you the ropes, you tell him ""how am I supposed to learn or practice on my own if you're always coming with me?"" Or you can question him, ""you don't think I can figure it out by myself?"" Or ""someone else already said they would help me""

Or if he says something that sounds fake but with a tone of authority, like not logging extra hours, you could say ""huh, interesting. I'll have to ask our boss about that because that's new to me """
"He paid money to cheat on you.

If being cheated on isnt enough to realize this man neither respects or values you or your relationship, maybe hammering home the fact that he PAID to disrespect you and your relationship will.

You deserve better."
"I know you're still going to have your doubts, I know you're afraid of rejection, and I know you're afraid of ruining a friendship, but just listen to some advice from a guy whose been in that situation before - he likes you.

Whenever I've been in your situation, I simply text the girl this, ""Hey I know this is a random question, but I want you to be truthful with me - do you like me more than a friend?"". Every single time I had a feeling there was more than friendship, I was correct, and they admitted they wanted more. I bet you're in the same boat. Send that text, it's going to relieve a lot of stress getting this off  your chest. I'm 28 and have been in quite a few relationships, I know these things. Just send it.

If he wasn't interested he wouldn't be texting you all the time and talking to you all the time. Relationships are literally that simple, you're the one making this complicated.

And before you say he hasn't made a move physically, that doesn't mean shit. I never make a move on a chick physically, but I can assure you once I know she's into me, shit does down quick and dirty. So send him that text and let him know what you're feeling. "

"I think most of us here like to think we’re good people and most of us have also been dumped. It hurts. However, being a good person doesn’t mean we’re automatically a match for every single person out there. It takes a lot more than that to sustain a happy and healthy relationship. 

I think there are two big mistakes you can make:

1) Taking back the breakup when she starts crying and asks why, says your reasons don’t make sense, etc. This is also known as “giving her another chance.” That is actually cruel because you know you don’t want to be in a relationship with her so it’s delaying the inevitable. Eventually you will have to do the breakup conversation all over again and make her cry again, just make it stick the first time. You will probably feel like a jerk and it’s totally human to say “never mind, let’s see if we can make it work, stop crying, I do love you...” Be strong and resist that urge.

Mistake 2) Agreeing to be her friend and “nothing will change between us, we just won’t be dating.” This is also cruel, unless she has no romantic feelings for you and is relieved you’re breaking up with her. She will get over you faster if you aren’t in her life. As long as she is pining over you, planning her next conversation with you, hanging out with you as “just friends,” and so on, she will be in a weird limbo state where she is waiting for you to change your mind. Set her free to heal properly, and then she will be available when a better match comes along. It’s possible you can be friends later, when all romantic feelings have died down and she isn’t interested in you that way. "
"I don't really know how to describe it, but you seem a little pushy about her being gay?  I totally understand that you want to be supportive, but there's a difference between being supportive and informing all of your family members about your daughters sexuality; that just isn't something that anyone else really needs to be involved in.  You should let her grow and change at her own pace without involving others unless that's what she wants. Your mother isn't assuming your daughter is going to change her mind, but is suggesting that you leave the door open in case she does."
"Your parents got their karma - she will get hers. She's as bad a person as they are. The resentment will pass and you will eventually be able to pity her.

You found a man that you love and started a family. Be glad you didnt inherit the immoralities from the family like your sister did. It's greed that brings out the worst in people. You can try to fight the will, but most importantly cut your sister out completely. She's not family anymore, she's a thief - stealing from someone in need."
My mates do but usually funnily edited
"&gt;There's a vibe as she's attractive, we share the same passion, short-term goals etc. but nothing either of us are interested in pursuing.

Umm excuse me? No wonder your girlfriend is insecure. You shouldn't even thinking about pursuing because YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP. No wonder your girlfriend is seeing some red flags. 

&gt;This is obviously understandable. A previous relationship of my own was with a girl who danced competitively, almost exclusively, with a guy who literally looked young David Beckham. They danced well together. He was a good guy. Nothing bad ever happened. I didn't love the fact that it was with another guy, but I loved that she could fly off to and pursue her passion. But how I felt in that situation is largely besides the point.

Please stop comparing your relationship to a previous one. Just because you felt that way doesn't mean everyone could be peachy keen with it too.

How about you stop making this about you and sit down and listen to your partner's feelings? That's what matters most at the moment if you actually care about your SO. It's time to set some major boundaries on your end.

How much time are you actually spending with you SO too?"
"Also “I want us to pretend I didn’t do anything wrong, but that you have to prove to me why I should stay with you instead of the other girl” "
"She sounds very sheltered so of course a move and change of lifestyle would be stressful and detrimental to her mental health.  You say she doesn't want to go to school, but does she have any hobbies or interests?  Can she meet people through anything like that?  Even something simple like a jogging club or floral arrangement class since she enjoys gardening. I've made two major moves in my life (from one country to another, then back to original country but to a different city), and both times it took me 3 full years to feel like I was at home.  I went through bouts of depression and the grass always looks greener in the other place.  Around the 3 year mark, I had formed genuine friendships and began to feel comfortable and happy.  "
"I really don’t understand the stay at home wife concept, even if your income was good enough. She needs to do something, anything, to make herself useful outside of gardening and cooking. Even if it is side jobs like photography or personal assistant, something to help save up as much money as possible so that when kids come there is no struggle to send them to college or emergency surgery, etc. Or perhaps, when you finally decided to move, you would have had more savings to lean on with the higher cost of living. "
"A lot of men end up absorbing these sort of entitled ideals from the society they live in without even realizing how hypocritical it is. There are a million and one factors that lead to it, but a few jump off the top of my head:

1. This idea that men are ""visual"" and ""sexual"" and women are ""emotional""; so women don't really care what a man looks like as long as he's smart and nice but a woman has to look good for a man

2. The fact that in a lot of media, guys who aren't attractive/put together/really that great at anything really tend to land girlfriends/wives who are super hot/at the very least better looking than their husbands (think King of Queens, Family Guy, etc)

3. This idea that ""you can't help what you're attracted to"" so it's not their fault they only like girls with tiny waists and huge knockers!

4. The notion that they, as a individual, are so special, unique, amazing and worthwhile that there is no reason they shouldn't get everything they want

All of it is fucking garbage of course. "

"Because it's much better to prepare for the worst than to hope for the best. You don't know her or her husband, outside of the fact that he seems to have no problem lying to her face. Others have pointed out that the visa situation has the potential to become a huge problem for her. It's not worth risking having her life ruined to save on legal fees - it's great that it worked out for you, but it's bad advice."
Yeah and it can take months or years. 
"“Something damning” like giving an underage girl drugs? Like trying to get underage girls high and alone with him? Like flirting with high school students saying he’d date them? Like actually dating underage girls?

What is something damning to you? Where do you draw that line? Because he’s a predator, already preying in young girls. "
"Does your room lock?

Homeboy needs to learn that shared-living requires a minimum level of self-policing. I suspect that your landlords will handle this, because there's no way he's not going to make violent threats to them. It is likely that your lease forbids use of the home to do illegal activities including consuming drugs. Can you take a picture of anything you see left out or get audio recordings when he goes off? 

Also, please do not indulge this little shit's ideas about beauty and the human body. "
"I’m leaning toward inconsiderate moron. There’s been no pattern or history like this. Currently, he encourages me to be comfortable and wear what makes me happy. I’m glad he doesn’t hold the same opinion of me presently. It just makes me feel hyper aware of how I dress now. Logically, I know it doesn’t matter to him anymore. Illogically, I wonder if he still quietly judges me which has been making me judge myself harsher which is not a great feeling. "
So she wants you to break up with your gf? That sounds toxic af. Does she plan on keeping you forever so after she passes you are alone and old because she didn't let you live your life?? She's being selfish and she should cultivate some of her own friendships
"I had my wife cheat on me a week after we got back from the honeymoon. Although in the end I'm much happier, I loved her very much and it crushed me.  You will be happier in the long run for getting rid of this loser like babygreenvines is saying, but be prepared to be an emotional wreck for a while. It's normal, and although it will hurt tremendously losing someone you deeply love in the beginning, it will be absolutely worth it in the long run.  Good luck! Have some internet hugs on the house *hugs*"
"Taking my own personal opinion about this “tulpa” business out of my response - I still side with your partner. 

It’s ok to have hard limits and this is one of his. Let him have his own opinion on it and if that opinion clashes with yours, you aren’t compatible. "
"&gt; but they don’t listen.

This is one of those situations where the explanation does not contain any information that changes their positions.

Your (ex)girlfriend doesn’t want to date someone who makes out with his sister. At all. Under any circumstances. She probably doesn’t want to date someone who cheats on her. At all. Your explanation doesn’t change the fact that you are someone who cheated on your girlfriend with your sister.

Your mother isn’t OK with her children making out with each other. At all. Under any circumstances.

You think that your drunkness is relevant, but it is not relevant to them, because it is just one of many circumstances in which this would not be OK. 
"
Please tell her. If I were the wife I would want to know two hr bang sessions happened in my bed.
I don't buy that men like this are clueless that it is wrong.  They know and don't care.
"I think the implication here is that it is shameful when you are in relationship. Like a very mild form of cheating. I imagine not all people would be bothered by this tbh, if it stayed in the realm of harmless flirting. But yeah, OP's issue is that it feels disrespectful to her because he is doing this while dating her. "
"Your Dad has the patience of a saint.

I feel sad for your Mom that she never got to a happy place in her life. I hope you're doing well!"
"These ""tell her my feelings"" emotion dumps are *always* awful ideas. You don't live in a rom-com. Just ask the girl for coffee/drinks or something."
"I'm sorry, this is going to not be really anything useful but I really hope it may?

Your boyfriend sounds really awful. You don't feel comfortable to be able to talk about your *needs* because it will *upset* him? 

He doesn't have any *respect* for them either because he get's ""*bothered*"" when you're trying to *take care of yourself?*

He's your boyfriend. He seems apathetic to your issues when he should be trying to help and care for you?? Not get defensive, defending himself?? You are partners, a team trying to work through things *together* what's he getting all antsy for when you're only trying to help yourself? He needs to be supportive for you, understand you and try to fix things for the team. Not worry about himself and what's convenient to him when it's causing you to struggle so much. He has no right to get so defensive!! 

I really wish you the best and if possible, please let me know how things go. I wish you all the best!!!"
"........are they aware the clitoris can be sorta kinda somewhat sensitive or?

Jesus. It's said there are more nerve endings in the clitoris than the entire penis. (Other say just the head of the penis, but either way, it's a lot.)

I'm willing to place a bet that her and her partner will want to meet up outside of class to practice.

"There are treatments for ADHD other than medication. There are therapists and counselors that can teach them how to manage their ADHD. There are also different types of medications than the ""standard"" medications.

My partner has ADHD and briefly went off his medication due to insurance changing and his laziness to find a new doctor. He drove me so crazy and gave me so many excuses about his ADHD I finally sat him down and told him I'm done with excuses. I have a chronic illness too that I take meds for and it would be hard for him to date me if I went off of them. I told him I was open to him not being on medication but he had to take real steps towards his treatment, whatever that may be. If I went off my meds, it would mean a huge lifestyle change for me to get by, and it still would be very difficult.

Just putting it out there that your boyfriend has a chronic illness, it's his responsibility to manage and you've done all you can to be understanding. He is not putting in the effort."
"☝🏻This plus telling you she’s going to keep spending time with him shows that she completely lacks any respect for you. She’s checked out, don’t disrespect yourself by chasing her."
"Or because they grew up in severely traumatic environments and developed behavioral responses which were functional in that environment but which are maladaptive in adult relationships.

I have a hard time self soothing in situations where conflict and  hostility trigger me to reexperience childhood abuse. This is not because I was coddled, it's because the abuse damaged me, and while I am working on improving how I handle such situations, that doesn't change the past, or make your sweeping generalization true."

"Here’s my thing. You have a pet. You leave the pet voluntarily. Do you not check in on the pet?

I don’t think it’s massively unclear. From what I can tell OP and her bf currently live in the apartment he had just moved into with his ex. Ex had been there during the time bf was over at OPs and house sitting and having a dandy time—did he never in that two plus month time check on his pet? That would be bad cat fatherhood.


Regardless of living situation, it is his pet and he is responsible for its health and happiness. He doesn’t get a pass because he chose to abandon it with his ex for a while."
"The advice I would always give to someone considering trying non monogamy would be, only try it if you are prepared to accept the possibility that it will lead to the end of the relationship. It does work for many people, and perhaps you two are one of the couples that can make it work, but a very common way for this situation to play out is that both parties are on board at the start, but it doesn't feel right when things actually become real and/or one person takes advantage of the open relationship to a greater extent than the other, the person who doesn't like the new status quo wants to put the genie back in the bottle, jealousy and bitterness ensue, and those feelings lead to conflict that ends up torpedoing the relationship. Edit: in your situation, there is also a good possibility she'll meet a nice woman and leave you for her. 

My advice would be, anything is better than the status quo. You are way too young and childless to be seriously considering settling down into a comfortable sexless relationship to ""grow old in."" Try non monogamy if you want as a ""hail Mary"" before ending the relationship, but don't just resign yourself to an unsatisfactory situation and start test fitting yourself for coffins. "
Seriously this. I had to read that line twice.  He's still going to see this girl.  Ahhh it's over.  Hopefully his name isn't on the property.  Tell him he has 24 hrs to find somewhere else to live and get his shit out of your house. 
"How do you do these things? The thought of closure terrifies me. It means it’s over, really really over. And I know in my head that it’s quite clearly already over, but my heart whispers that maybe there’s still a chance. How do I deal with that? I’m sorry, I’m just broken and don’t know what to do."
"Don't worry, that's a pretty typical sort of terrible response that is expected here on r/relationships. I understood your point.

But in my opinion, I'd assess a few things. What kind of friend she is, if she would listen to reason why you really don't approve of her actions, and if she would understand that you can't be put in that situation again. 

Everyone around here will always tell you to ditch at the first sign of anything. It's always so black and white in the responses, where the situations rarely are. 

Just decide where you would be comfortable, and tell her your thoughts, and her reaction should tell you what kind of friend she is.

"Dog in this scenario I'd pay basically all of it if I was you. If it wasn't for her you'd be paying double that.

Please. If their in school that means activities are after school. Activity starts at 4pm? Nope he said he's working. 5pm? Well he just got home. 5:30? Sure, dad can take you! But most activities and practice are an hour and a half to two hours. So he's going to pick up his kids at 7/7:30pm when he got up at 5? Doubt it. I don't believe for a second that a man who says he's working from 5:45 to 5pm Monday to Friday on his own company is driving his kids to everything as well when he get home. Even if the activity was in the morning! He gets up at 5 to get to work at 5:45! There's nothing he's doing in the morning for that family. Who gets the kids ready and to school? Mom. Who packs their lunches? Mom. Who do they call when they forget something? Mom. If they activities start at a normal time during the week day (I.e. Immediately after school) mom is taking them. Mom is picking them up. Mom is making sure they have all the right equipment. Mom is dropping them off. Mom is getting gas for the car. Mom is bringing them snacks. Mom is talking to the teachers about their school. Mom is talking to the coaches about their activities. Kids are not fully functioning adults at their ages.

Even if he's just in your room, they can never really fully relax in the common areas knowing he's around. It's their space and they've paid for it too. Your boyfriend is not paying to live in your dorm.

I would ask your new roommates how they feel about it and see how it goes from there."
"I don’t know if they’re NOT inexperienced, though? OP sounds kind of immature, generally (this whole post reads like a YA novel), and his only relationship to date has been a high school “relationship” that lasted nine years, some of which had to be long distance, as OP moved away from where he went to high school to go to college. This is his second “relationship.” To me, it reads like OP is actually INCREDIBLY inexperienced, and, you're right, this relationship is going far too quickly.  But hey!  Four people on Reddit told their spouses that they were in love the night they met and it worked out for them, so it's bound to work out for these two, right?"

"&gt;  Not just because he has trust issues, but because we're a married couple. We do things together.

The only people he couldn’t schmooze were my parents. 

If you really wanna get into some personal issues, lol...

He is a lot like my biological father. My “dad” is really my step dad. My bio-dad is some deadbeat guy who lives in another state and I haven’t seen him since I was 13. Can’t keep a job, very sociable. The only differences between my husband and bio-dad are their political leanings (dad is liberal husband is republican). Talk about daddy issues :P I basically married my dad. 

But that’s why I think my parents could see through the facade. They’re used to it from bio-dad. I haven’t spoken to bio-dad in years, and my only memories from him are when he took me to Disneyland once and all the presents he sent me over the years to buy my love. "

If you want this to last, don't rush it. Don't just whitewash everything, assume she's some angel, assume you're ""perfect"" for each other and fill in all the blanks you have right now with everything you *want* to be true about each other.

"You do not “have until Monday” to decide if you want to break up with him. You have your whole life to decide. There is no deadline for ending a relationship. 

This isn’t something I’d break up with my own wonderful, amazing boyfriend over...but I’m not you. It’s your prerogative to decide whether or not you’re willing to accept anything less than complete transparency in your relationships. I’ll tell you right now though - you’ll have a hard time finding a partner that will be 100% forthcoming every minute of every day. There will be times when they (and you) fudge the truth, for reasons that feel logical at the time. You just have to hope that said truth-fudging is low stakes, and doesn’t point to anything nefarious or to a larger pattern of dishonesty. 

But I give you permission to take the pressure off yourself this time. You do not have to decide anything by Monday. You can just talk. Maybe the conversation will lead to a decision, maybe it won’t. Maybe you need a week or two to decide if it’s worth it to do battle with your anxieties for him.  You’re allowed to ask for that space. 

For now, just take some deep breaths, eat a good meal, go for a walk. Clear your head for a while. There’s no need to panic. You have time. "

"Haha yup, it really felt like it hit home, that underlying feeling where you're having an argument and can't shake the feeling that underneath they're actually partly mad because they had a crush on the person in question and all the words are just ""fluff"" to hide the truth from you and themselves. 

""I am independent"", ""I want to have space"" ""it's just a friend"" ""why are you being so jealous"" ""why are you trying to ruin my friendship"" -----&gt; leading some time later to -----&gt; ""I love them and am in love with them"" ""I just want to be happy"", ""I didn't think you'd be this mad"".

----------

To OP if you read this: It really would appear that nothing has happened between them so that's good. You need to continue talking with each other and try to reach an understanding. Is she feeling like something is missing from her life? Does she have enough friends? Are you feeling like something is missing? 

You gotta fix this now in the early stages. She doesn't probably realize herself that she had a crush, but crushes happen - it's just a part of life. You too will get a crush on someone at some point. You need to however figure out if you guys want to be together regardless of quick crushes, and figure out how to deal with it together when such things happen. A basis in this is being satisfied in general.

If you still feel like things are a bit sore several weeks after, consider having a therapist involved. Again: better to deal with it early than to let some shit germinate underneath the surface and create more negative feelings. Of course this is a very minor thing and might just blow over with communication, but if it doesn't and there's something underneath that poisons your relationship - you'd want to deal with it sooner rather than later."

Going to a music festival has basically nothing to do with having a career in the music industry (is there a good chance that is going to pay well, btw? Because I’m from LA and I know no one what was actually able to make a living in the industry full time). 

Anyway that being said, music festivals are important COLLEGE experience bc your body can still handle it ;) So if you MUST go, Get a burner phone and set your phone to forward all calls to it. Leave your phone at home. And stop oversharing with your parents. Information diet."
"I don't think you're ready (and by you, I mean you-the-couple) to open up the marriage. As I understand it, successful open marriages have established ground rules and values designed to protect the marriage. The specifics vary from couple to couple, but examples are ""we only do strangers,"" ""we only do people we chose together,"" or ""we don't cancel on each other for the third party."" If she was choosing this guy before you'd even reached consensus about what categories of people might be off-limits, I can only assume you've never discussed things like that. If you do continue down this path, I recommend you read Opening Up.

However, honestly, she comes across to me as basically just wanting a hall pass to cheat with this guy. That's why she's so attached to the idea. If the appeal was in opening the marriage in general, I think she would be more flexible about choosing someone you were comfortable with, to maximise the chances of it working out and to protect your marriage. I think if her long game was a healthy open marriage, even if she was attracted to this guy, she would be more inclined to say, ""You know what? Plenty of other fish in the sea.""

I think this whole idea needs to be put aside for the moment in favour of, at the very least, some soul-searching about ground rules together, if not some marital counselling. You can always come back to it later, but I think you have some bigger problems you need to deal with first."
"&gt;She admits to kissing one of them but swears that she didn't do anything else.

As if that makes it okay??? 

You damn well should be done with this. "
"Just a question. My girlfriend doesn’t want me talking to a girl that’s in my program that I study with because she’s very attractive and we’ve been becoming close friends. She compares it to me not being thrilled about her being close friends with guys she’s had sex with. I am not friends with anyone I’ve had a past with so I don’t feel like it’s hypocritical, but she’s saying I’m crazy for not seeing her side. Me and this girl do not have any sort of history. We’ve always been friends "
"""What he's done for you ""?

What he's done is cheat on you, ensure you knew about it, then threaten to do it again as a ""joke"" while scolding you for not trusting him because he does stuff for you and therefore you owe him. He's manipulative.

This is not healthy at all. In a healthy relationship, if people have agreed to be monogamous they don't cheat or imply they are going to. In fact, they agree that cheating is a dealbreaker, don't do it, and don't want to do it. 

They also don't try to manipulate you by implying you owe them for treating you like anyone in a loving relationship should treat their SO. Respect and good treatment should be a basic foundation of a relationship, not some special favor he's doing you and needs to be rewarded for. Ugh.

Dump this guy, read up on healthy relationships, do single you for awhile, and then look for someone kind and respectful who holds the same values you do and doesn't act entitled."

Look. The age gap is not that much when you are a little older. But to date a college guy while still in HS that is a bit much. To each their own but I would personally not let my 17 year old who is a junior  in HS to date a college student.  Once she was in college that would be different.   They are just want to protect you 
"So this isn't really a ""you"" problem? This is a problem between your dad and his wife. You can keep being polite-but-distant without feeling the slightest bit of guilt, and she can have whatever feelings she wants about that. Your dad *definitely* needs to stop trying to make you responsible for her emotions - that is the part that is SUPER weird and rude here. The next time he brings it up just tell him ""If Barbra wants to talk about our relationship I would prefer that she speak to me directly."" If she's 'too scared' to talk to you herself? Oh dang that sounds like a not-you problem!

The kids are fine - you can hang with them when you're visiting and be the cool older stepsister or whatever. You might have a better relationship when they're older AND you're not having their teenage angst filtered through your dad's relationship problems. Or maybe not! Even blood siblings are sometimes not close.

So quick review: 1. Your dad really needs to stop making you the focus of his problems! Tell him you are not discussing this with him anymore and suddenly be super busy and have to leave if he brings it up AT ALL. 2. His wife is maybe not a fan of you! That sucks! Oh well! Lots of family members don't like each other that much. 3. Your dad's wife maybe doesn't treat him with respect and says he was a terrible parent. That is very unkind! And also not something you can control.

Conclusion: your dad's wife does not sound great and that is a problem only he can deal with and in no way should it involve you"
"Request a roommate change NOW! She completely invaded your privacy, and won't speak to you. If someone entered your private room and searched through your personal possessions until they found ""contraband,"" would that be okay? It would not! 

Consider this a blessing! You know now, very early on, that living with this individual will be energy-consuming and anxiety provoking. Sadly, her actions are most likely misguided attempt at receiving a single room, since it is you who will be forced to request transfer. What she does not realize yet, however, is that in time, you will be replaced by another roommate. And another. She will realize that  YOU were not the problem--and eventually, the University will realize that she is the issue. I hope they do not reward her with a single dorm if this is indeed her motive, as it is entitled and problematic behavior on her end.

Good luck! Keep us updated! "
"Notice how she turned the tables on you. You should be the one upset with her, and she should be the one asking for forgiveness. "
"I spent years working in this industry and it is extremely competitive. Especially if you want to work for a big name ""AAA"" games label, you either need to have a degree at minimum, or you have to be an absolute rock star with years of experience under your belt. Whether or not you have a relevant degree, what game companies are looking for is passion. ""I love playing video games"" means nothing, it's not a qualification. That's like applying to work as a chef and putting, ""I like eating food"" on your resume. What do you have in your portfolio? What projects have you created in your free time? How is your level of proficiency with scripting and coding? Can you demonstrate your creative and artistic talents and abilities? Are you self-driven and willing and able to put in crazy hours to meet tight deadlines? No game company wants a lazy oaf who thinks designing video games will be a fun and easy dream job. It can be extremely rewarding and it is a dream job for many, but it's far from easy. A LOT of people burn out. I highly doubt OP's husband, who seems completely lacking in grit and determination, would ever make it in the industry."

"It's *his* house.  He can screw it up all he wants.  Although this:

&gt; He is an engineer by trade so he's pretty handy.

...belies facts.  However, what did you say to him about your ""gifts""?"
"i hope you don't mind a guy commenting, but i'm telling you right now that no sane guy would care that you're a virgin.  most of us lie about our sexual experience anyway.  i wouldn't worry a second over it."
" Basically she didn’t care before so it was fine, but now she does so it’s an issue. Demonstrates that for her it wasn’t a real compromise. "
"...and to add to this, how can *you* OP genuinely respect *her* when her opinions are insane, potentially dangerous and (at least in one case) seriously offensive."
"The most charitable interpretation of his motivation (for being an asshole) is this:

He's doing the ""right thing"" in life by taking the path that leads to money, safety and respect. The path laid out for him by his family, that he didn't really choose. And it doesn't make him happy.

Then, he sees this couple that took the path you're not supposed to take, because they wanted to. And they're happy anyway. He can't accept that, because it means that HE could have maybe made the ""stupid"" or risky choices he wanted to, and maybe it wouldn't have ended in disaster. So he stays safe in his unhappy choice by insisting that they're trashy.

Anyway, he's being an asshole and who cares if he has some complex motivations behind it or not."
"You're always going to be the ""black sheep"" of your family; you know this, and you need to come to a sense of peace with this. I can tell that you're 50% there. 

I would not associate with these people at all, much less give them a large sum of money."
"Oh please. This sounds like hogwash from 1875. 

Alcohol does lower inhibitions. After that you lost the script. "
"As a child of divorced parents, I wish they did it sooner so that I at least had the chance to witness a healthy loving relationship between two adults (parent and stepparent). A child is smart and can sense unhappiness between their parents. Do you kids a favor and get a divorce. "
"Oh, my goodness. I am so terribly sorry. They are all at peace. What a wonderful person you are for the effort you put in towards bringing sunshine to his days. "
"I agree that getting married within a month of dating is dumb, but he didn’t just say it was dumb. He said it was trashy, and 6 years later OPs sister and husband are trash. *That* is incredibly rude, especially after being kindly invited over for dinner. Someone prepares a meal for you in their home and you turn around and disrespect them - now *that* is tacky. And the way he blurted it out at dinner just shows that the whole time he was being treated well all he could think about was passing judgement. "
"Don't make threats anymore. Set boundaries, and hold them. Be true to your word. Follow through on what you tell her the consequences are for her behavior. You're giving her too much credit on ""forgetting"" that you don't like her touching you. She isn't forgetting, she just isn't giving your opinion any thought. The squirt bottle isn't a terrible idea, but I think physically moving away from her when she does this will help a lot too. Don't sit and let her touch you. You don't deserve that, she does not own you.

 I'm autistic too, and I am so sorry she's infantilizing you so much. You deserve agency and respect. You know more about you than anyone else ever can or could. She should recognize that."
“My queen” hahahaha unreal

There was a discussion,. The issue was that her BF decided having the discussion with his friend was more important than his actual partner.  "

"Gross, I'd call the cops on your rapey ass. Consent is not automatically given just because a woman is in a club.  Believe it or not,  you get just as arrested sexually assaulting a woman in a club as you do sexually assaulting a woman at work or on the bus.  "
