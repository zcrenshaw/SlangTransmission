Yes, you can. /Obama"
"This is ""involuntary psychiatric hold for evaluation"" territory. 

Call your doctor and ask for advice."
It sounds fishy to a sober person. But reasonable to a drunk person. 
"&gt;Reddit, I'm fucking livid with them and I will not be able to hold my tongue at our next encounter, whenever that may be

So your plan is to be another problem she has to deal with? You are going to make her manage your feelings as well? 

Support your girlfriend. She wants to deal with these people very infrequently because they are all assholes. Don't make it harder. "
"that's not shock therapy, if anything it'd be exposure therapy. :)"
"She absolutely deserves to get fired.

Is it worth it?  I dunno.  But regardless of that, he needs to carefully consider if he's put so much as a toe out of line, because getting a well liked employee fired is not going to make life easier.

That said, it's rather alarming that they wouldn't take PHI more seriously.  In all honesty, I'd be worried about that outlook in a medical clinic and look for work elsewhere.

And once he leaves, there'd definitely not be a reason to not report Sarah."
"Well, you should probably quit calling him your fiancé since he broke up with you. 

Breakups are unilateral deals. You don’t have to be on board with it for the breakup to happen anyway. 

It doesn’t feel like it now but he is doing you a solid. His family is a nightmare and even if you get out of their financial clutches, he’s got enough baggage to operate a Samsonite outlet store. "
"He's honestly a horrific partner and human being. The heartbreak will heal with time but I highly suggest you get into therapy and figure out why you considered this guy a soulmate when he said these things to you:

&gt; when he told me work would always come before me and that work would always be his number one priority

&gt; and in the past he said only sl*ts dye their hair,

&gt;He had told me that my makeup looked like a stripper’s makeup in the past and he still thinks so.

&gt;he ended up calling me stuff like “you delusional bitch” 

Does this sound like things that someone who loves and cares about you would say? Because they're not. You will be much better off without him, but you need to get into therapy to work on your self-esteem. In the meantime, I highly suggest getting into some new hobbies, particularly social ones."
"While you are technically correct, laws like this really only apply if you can afford to fight for your rights. Besides the fact that MIL is unlikely to want to take legal action against her son, could she afford to even if she wanted to? Lawyers do not come cheap."
"Where are you living?

I think you should forgive Carl for what he said - he was being attacked too, and he reacted badly to try and make it stop.

Other than that - people can only hurt you if you let them. People can only have power over you if you let them.

These people are a shower of fucking bastards, and you don't have to deal with that. You don't have to respect their opinions. You don't have to take their shit on board. You don't have to listen to what they say - and you don't have to let their bullshit insecurities affect you.

You're evidently a strong person. You've dealt with a fuckload in your life so far - and you're still standing. Look up the song ""tubthumping"" by ""chumbawuma"" - that's you, pal. Getting knocked down and getting right back up again.

This advice is easy to give, and hard to follow, but it's the only thing that wilol work.

I could go on for ages explaining their behaviour and how it's rooted in insecuirty and not really about you and blah blah blah, but who fucking cares. They're all shitebags, who cares what their motivations for being shitebags are. Fuck 'em.

Fuck em right in the ear. And if they don't like that? Fuck em in the other ear.

But, for real, just don't react. Don't engege - don't respond- don't listen to them. Just ignore them.

Would it bother you if a three year old called you an asshole? No, it wouldn't. because a three year old has no power over you.

Take back your power and understand that your best weapon, your only weapon, is your refusal. Your refusal to be embarrassed. Your refusal to listen to them. Your refusal to be bowed, or cowed, or broken. Your refusal to do anything other than live your life how you want and ignore the attacks of a load of bastards.

Any more specific advice will depend on where you are.

(NB - I don't know if this is helpful - it could backfire - but whichever one of the popular guys is the most vocal about attacking you for your homosexuality is himself almost certainly homosexual. I'd mention that the next time he starts - ask him why he's so obsessed with homosexuality? Ask him why he's always talking to you about it and imagining you doing various sexual things with men - does he need to speak to someone?)

Good luck, fam.

Everything else aside, count how many days between now and graduation and just do each day. Head down, do your time, and remember every day you get through is one day closer to freedom. It's how people get through prison."
"Unfortunately, if he's financially dependent on them (i.e. living under their roof or needing other resources provided by them) he has to live with their rules. If he's not financially dependent on them, fuck 'em all then."
"A friend of my brother left a jacket at my parents’ house once. Nobody knew who it belonged to. It fitted me perfectly. I started wearing it. Had it for a bit over a year. Grew to love it. It was one of those vintage army green jackets with lots of pockets and shit. I had some like it before, but this one was by far the best fitting and most stylish one. One day I go with my brother to his friend’s house. As soon as he sees me he recognizes the jacket. He thought he had lost it elsewhere and never even asked about it. It was hard bidding farewell to that amazing garment, but it was only the right thing to do, and he seemed really glad to have it back. I never did find another one quite like it. Never again wore that type of jacket. Writing about it makes me want to try and find some similar one, but maybe the time for wearing army green jackets with tons of pockets is behind me. I’ll have to sleep on it."
"I don't see how that would mean you're incompatible, you both seem to want a monogamous relationship, so that's the same thing right?

To play devil's advocate for a bit, she could have the same sort of doubts about you. I mean, she didn't bother to date people she didn't want a relationship with, you dated four people you truly loved at the time, but those relationships didn't last. So if you're both looking for forever after that could have her internal voice going 'well he says he loves me and we're in a relationship, but his other ones didn't last either'. 

(I'm sure you breaking up before was for the best and there were good reasons etc, just want to offer you a different perspective)."
"Everyone is saying the same thing about the event. I’ve always felt paranoid that he didn’t love me as much as I love him but I brushed it off as just my low self worth. I’m feeling pretty heartbroken knowing that his actions mean that he probably just doesn’t care about me that much. I didn’t realise that it was such a big deal. 
Thank you for the advice."
"I don't know if this is a ""red flag,"" per se but he certainly sounds like an unbearable prick who I'd never want to be around, let alone sleep with. Does he do this to other people or does he save his extra special garbage treatment for you?"
"&gt;  I wouldn't care if it was a few times, but it's every time and nothing else.

It sounds like you've done everything right - you've indulged his fetish, within reason. And now you're right to expect him to meet your needs, as well.

And he's not doing that. 

Demand that some of your sex be non-fetish related. If he can't do that, break up with him.

You're not going to break him of this kink, and given his porn habits, I think it's unlikely that he wants to change.  He's already displayed enough selfishness in the bedroom that you have all the cause you could possibly want for dumping him. "
"This guy never cared for you, because if he did, he'd at least make the effort to rejuvinate the relationship. Honestly, him, his partner and your former ""friends"" don't deserve your attention. You seem like a sweet lass, you'll get new friends so valuable that your former friends will kick themselves for ever chatting shit about you."
"Hell, my first thought was the Seinfeld episode where his girlfriend was awesome but everyone acted like there was something wrong with her, and he couldn't understand what was going on.

""You know, this is like that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same but everybody else is different.""

""Which one?""

""They were all like that."""
"I am in no way in any circumstances related to this, but. I had a good friend in college, who had an arranged marriage to a woman in his home country right after he graduated. It didn't work out, and they had the marriage quietly annulled within the year. A few years later, after graduate school and a little bit of maturing, he met a woman from his home country in our country. They married a few years ago and seem to be blissfully happy. So, it does seem that there is a way back from something like this, if that's what you want."
"&gt; If Mommy was playing with her during this time I would TOTALLY understand that, but she's usually staring at her phone

If she's checking out of shared social time with the family, that's completely on her. I know you don't want this to ""blow up"", but you need to have an honest conversation with your wife about this. Don't attack her, start by acknowledging her frustration and then bring up what you've observed in a matter of fact way and not a judging way. The being on the phone while doing something with the kids is pretty damn rude and disrespectful in general, but maybe bring it up like ""When we were playing &lt;game X&gt; last night, I saw that you were more focused on your phone than on the game.""

Another question, is your wife a SAHM with the 4yo? Does she get much adult time during the day? If not, then by the time you and the older kids are home, she might be mentally exhausted from 8-10 hours of 4yo time. Since there is a big age gap, maybe one night a week you could take the 4yo to do 4yo things, and mom could take the older ones to do something they like."

"To be honest, you are remarkably lucky that your daughter is even willing to have you in her life at all. Your wife is currently wrecking the very fragile relationship you and your daughter have. Step up and be a good father for once in your life and put a stop to your wife's bullshit. "
"I've just always imagined myself having my own little apartment and being alone for a bit downtown. It's something I always imagined myself doing as a 13 yo reading cosmo and shit - being miss independent in the big city doing my thing lol. Back when cosmo was cool ~*~

I'd feel weird if we lived together forever and never got to experience that! I think he has his own version of that feeling as well, it's just something we want to cross off"
"Usually, yes. Also, her husband will probably be armed. You don't want criminals sitting in such a way that they can grab the MP's firearm."
"I think you need someone to talk to about the psychological side. The biological side can be overcome with will power. And I speak from experience, I was on a medication that killed my appetite and I wouldn't want to eat until I felt weak.  But when my doctor said ""Hey you need to stop losing weight "". I started eating every meal whether I wanted it or not. And trust me I get how joyless it can be to shovel food in your mouth when you aren't hungry. But I viewed it like working out, it's not something I always enjoy but overall I feel better doing it regularly. I would keep a stock of king size candy bars for days I didn't eat well and cram down one or two at the end of the day.  There is plenty of calorie dense food out there that you can eat without an appetite to hit a calorie goal. 

But none of those strategies matter because your mind isn't letting you take care of yourself.  And your husband and mom are trying to help in their way. You need to see someone who specializes in eating disorders and maybe they can give your lived ones strategies to help you."
Your bf is a selfish ass. That's who he is and he isn't interested in changing. Don't stay with someone you need to change to be happy with. The fact that he won't even take responsibility for the fact that he's an ass is a huge red flag and I don't see him ever changing his behavior while you two are together.
"Hmm I’ve actually wanted to do this (I do wood working and want to get into glass). Isn’t it anyone’s dream to not feel locked to your work and actually have a hobby that brings in money? Your life sounds great 

But you understand most people can’t even *dream* of having that for another 25-35 Years? 

Hell they won’t likely have a spouse for 5-10 years!

So ya... I mean this in a kind way, OP, shut up or tone it down. 

I’m sure they’re really happy for your marriage and newfound happiness, but anyone struggling to figure to pay bills and get a career isn’t going to cheer for the girl talking about how selling the Etsy crotchet squirrel was ‘bonus’ money that week. 

You may not (think) you’re doing that (and I *definitely* don’t think it’s intentional), but considering you’re coming off of a honeymoon high, I don’t think you’ll realize just how much you could come across. Hell most friends I know are annoying right after they get married because they’re just so wrapped up in their newfound happiness. Like, I get it, I’m happy for you, but my dog just died so could you chill? 

You can still share your life, but tone it down and focus on discussing things your friends can *relate* to. "
"You can still apply for an entry-level position in an office, marketing, copywriting, magazine etc., something where you strong written word would be of use. Maybe some industry that's vaguely related to the sex industry like a company that makes sex toys or a nudie-esque magazine, where your previous career isn't seen as a negative. Having a bachelor degree is useful as you can go into all sorts of random careers without necessarily having a directly related education. Many, many people do this. 

If you're not sure what you want, hit up a career counselor or headhunter. Find some comapny's you want to work for, and see if there are any positions you can interview for. If you don't make it on the first round, don't sweat it. Ask what they're looking for in candidates, take on volunteer positions since you've got cash. If you show you're really making an effort, people will notice.

You're in a super great position to do whatever you want since you've got a bachelor's and you're financially set up. Heck, you could even pursue a master's."
"It was absolutely not her choice to make! If she had chosen to give us a gender neutral gift or whatever, I would've been completely fine with that. I feel very used that she took an event that meant alot to my husband and myself as a way to push her agenda on our family and friends."
"That's creepy as shit. He was either trying to spy on you in the shower or his sister. Voyeurism is disgusting either way, but this is a new level. No one would ever do this is as a joke. 

I'd tell the sister's parents, and take it from there. Don't let him back in your house."
"honestly? I think you should copy/paste what you wrote out in your post and in your comments, and if people in your family are harassing you you should send them an email with your experiences. Tell them you may never be able to forgive your childhood abuser, and that whatever point on your own journey to reconciliation is, it's none of their business, and they are re-victimising you if they continue to push it. Your experiences are valid. Laying them out on the table may be a way to get folks to understand that they cannot continue to try and enforce a family reunion.

And don't trust your brother. And if it comes down to him being around for thanksgiving/xmas, take some time just for yourself, away from the big gatherings. You do NOT have to attend family functions if you don't want to. You do not have to put yourself in a position where you will be badgered and re-victimised by people who don't know what the fuck they are talking about. Inform them of the extent of your traumatic childhood, claim your space to work through it AT YOUR OWN PACE, and read up on ""low contact"" methods. The raised by narcissists reddit has a pretty good wiki on how to maintain boundaries with family members who are pressuring you. 

Please understand that you were completely innocent. Your parents unfortunately failed to protect you from your abusive sibling. You can love and forgive them, but no one should be demanding that you forgive your brother as if all of a sudden none of the trauma you went through matters. "
"Other problems aside, take the bidet when you leave. Those things are boss. "
"&gt;I don't know if I should even bother correcting this to my ex-wife and family friends or if I should just let it blow over. 

I definitely would not confront your ex-wife.  She's not saying these things because she genuinely cares; she's saying them because she's jealous.  If it's not this, then it will be something else.  You'll get stuck in this endless cycle of explaining yourself to an irrational person.  You need to draw the line in the sand and start saying ""I will not discuss my personal life with you"" and end the conversation.

However, you might need to talk to your family friends about this.  Do they actually believe her?  Have they said anything to you or started treating you differently?"
"&gt;Says since nothing bad actually happened I need to drop it. Is he right?

Nope. If I stole your car, took it for a joyride and returned it to you exactly as I found it you would still be justified in pressing charges for theft. Just because there are no lasting consequences in this instance doesn’t negate the fact that there was a transgression.

The fact that he won’t apologise and dismisses you for being upset with him is really shitty. It doesn’t cost him anything to apologise, and if he’s not in any way remorseful for it, he may do something shitty again.

Maybe you should show him this thread. Rest assured, you’re not overreacting."
"I think the sooner the better, frankly."
"I'm so sorry to hear this, OP. What a shitty situation to be caught in. It's bad enough that you're so far away from home that you can't be with your dad right now, but I'm horrified by the complete lack of empathy demonstrated by your fiancé here. Is he like this often when things upset you?"
"So you were literally looking at other women WHILE cuddling with your wife, and you have the nerve to be upset when she posts pics of herself on the same site you get off on? 

Let me put it this way: you use the site to feel good (sexually, while your wife is right there) and your wife decides to use the site to feel good too (through attention, cause it seems like you're neglecting her).

Also please explain this to me:

&gt; I was honestly just looking because the girl went on vacation and it was hard not to.

How is 'she's on vacation' a reason for looking at a girl's profile for 20 days straight? Do you normally chat with her and you looked at her profile those 20 days because you missed her? Did she have really interesting pics from her vacation posted or something? WHY would you profile-stalk a random woman you don't know for 20 days straight if she's not even online (since she's on vacation)?? Please explain this, because my mind is whirling."
"It doesn't ruin my day. It kills my mood. You know, like how not having a shower kills hers? Different people have different sexual wants, triggers, desires, and needs. Long term partners just need to figure out how theirs fit together. 

I learned how to get by with occasionally waiting, just like my wife learned how to get by with occasionally not waiting."
"Not the person you asked but I ask all my pets how their day has been, what did you get up to, who’s a good boy or girl etc - I’m basically just talking utter crap to them. 

It’s not the words so much as the bonding, love and attention. I could be singing death metal to them and it’s still a bonding activity which they lap up. "
"Hey, just to reiterate what Katdai says above, but the onset of schizophrenia is actually a bit later for women, from mid to late twenties."
"Out of curiosity, is he in debt? Does he have a hard time meeting his financial obligations? Is he not saving for retirement? "
"The point that really crosses the line for me is that your work friend immediately replaced the tickets with new tickets for a different weekend. A casual work friend wouldn’t go to that length, and wouldn’t get a second set of tickets for you without checking dates first. She’s pursuing you. Even if this relationship is innocent on your end, it isn’t for the other woman.  "
"If you were truly socially aware, you would have realised that your joke was inappropriate for that audience - if you realised you have an uptight Staff Sergeant, then dont make knob jokes. But you did. Hence I am questioning how socially aware you really are.

It's not important, just ignore me."
"&gt; What if she leaves me?

Then you get what you deserve."
"If he stabs you in the chest and you miraculously recover 100% and have no scars or anything, would you be OK with it?

He almost ruined your life and just because he got lucky and there were no consequences for you, doesn't mean he should get off scot-free. "
"one thing i might suggest would be if you could get your son into counselling. it might make him feel better to talk to a stranger about this, and he might learn some good coping skills in dealing with this 'parent'

good luck. i feel bad for you and your kid. that really sucks."
"The only comment OP needs. I was emotionally abused by my father and his girlfriend until I was 14 and it has really fucked me up in the long-term over a decade later. Seriously, get him OUT of the situation and get him professional help because this is literally the kind of thing that fucks people up for life."
"So essentially he's planned two trips and wants to mash them together? No. Unless bro is also bringing along a tent this will NOT work long term. You're the only one willing to compromise/offer alternatives and he is not. This is not going to work.

pretty much there are several problems here

#1 This was supposed to be a couple's trip. Its now a couple's trip with a sibling third wheel because your BF is unwilling to do a separate trip with this brother.

#2 he's unwilling to hear you valid concerns/complaints because he doesn't get your need for privacy. When he told you he's ok living indefinitely with family that was him hinting at this trip and how HE envisions it. As far as he's concerned you should have no problem sharing minimal space with his brother because HE doesn't see a problem with it

#3No mention of his brother contributing which means you could easily end up funding more than your fair share.

You need to make him hear you. Write it all down ahead of time if you have to but he needs to hear what you are saying and not just saying oh it will work out.

example ""problem: We want to have sex but brother is around. We now have to ask/tell him to bug off for unknown period of time."""
"Whether or not it's about social/cultural/family pressure, she is literally choosing to marry someone else. Staying with her until it actually happens will destroy your self esteem and is totally pathetic. Don't do that. "
"You are romanticizing your shitty behavior. You can’t breathe think or eat without each other? Give me a break.

Your feelings aren’t special or unique. You’re infatuated with a married guy, congrats. The fact that he would do this to his pregnant wife indicates that he is an awful person. This is not true love, it’s lust and and fantasy. No amount of feeeelings can justify this behavior."
Shit or get off the pot man. If it's turtling and won't come out get a different pot. 
Lots of them and to be honest this mentality is why self medicating and alcoholism and death from alcohol poisoning are so common at colleges
"People tend to be split when someone says they have tried, want to, or will try to kill themselves. Some people want to help but have no idea what to say or do. Some people believe that you are just seeking attention and/or are trying to manipulate them. Some people just don't care. Some people will try to give you a reason to live.

Your friend may genuinely enjoy helping people. It's one thing when it's a stranger, and you can look at the situation objectively. It is entirely different when it's so close to home. She could be struggling with feelings of guilt. Perhaps she can't bring herself to talk to you because she feels that she should have seen the signs and believes that she has failed you. It is possible that she really doesn't care about you. The only person that can say for certain is her. All you can really do is send a message or letter to her saying that you understand that she may be going through some things, but that it would mean the world to you if she could be there for you. Let her know that she has the right to walk away, and the ball is in her court; you will give her space until she decides to close that distance.

The other friend... He probably is resentful that you would reject him, but then expect him to be there for you. He may think that he was not enough for you before, and that your boyfriend should be the one helping you through this. Rejection hurts. It's hard to get past to genuinely be friends again. I'm certain this is a whole other story of its own. Think of it from his perspective; you basically told him that he wasn't good enough for you, but now you are expecting him to help you through something that is extremely difficult for anyone to know what is right to say or do knowing that he still is not good enough for you.

I think that you should continue your therapy, find your reason to live, and then live your life to the fullest. Worrying about and assuming what other people are thinking or feeling is going to hold you back from healing. Just focus on you and let them decide whether or not to be in your life."
"There was a post the other day that got deleted, but the OP was mad that his wife went off BC without telling him and they had a child so early in the marriage and they hadn't become financially stable.

She was 35 when she gave birth and they had been married 7 or 8 years at that point. They lived in his parent's trailer and played video games. Miraculously, he finished his education and started a business once he had the motivation of a kid. He insisted they should have waited to have kids, ignoring the age of his wife. 

His post history indicated that he was at a minimum, emotionally cheating. So yeah, it is cruel."
"Ask him to adjust his meal plans if they aren't working for you (maybe build up to 2200). If he hasn't given you meal plans or methods to graduate to more calories, then you need a new one.

I'm glad you have help for the physical component of your problem. I think you need help for the psychological component too. Your husband and mother are overreacting because they see a serious problem that they don't know how to help you with. A therapist could give you advice for how to manage and direct them to do supportive things that help you move forward. Right now they are inadvertantly hindering you (likely creating more stress and more need for you to control your food intake) while trying to help. If they, and you, understood the psychological issues you are dealing with, you could give them better tools to help you."
"I'm sorry, but if that's all you got out of my comment, maybe you're not wanting an honest answer. 

Would you really give a shit if he broke up with you because you cut your hair?? If so, then you're not really ready for a normal relationship either. "
"You weren’t an official thing. She’s not even really your ex. She didn’t post about you on social media because she didn’t take you or your time together seriously. If she is putting pics of him up it’s because she is genuinely interested in having things with him go somewhere.

She can do whatever she wants. It’s none of your business. If it bothers you so much then stop looking. "
"They know that because his behaviour is manipulative.

People who are manipulative are rarely deliberately manipulative. They usually don't know how to be better people, and they need therapy to learn the tools to get through life without being manipulative in unhealthy ways."
"I was that dude for years and can agree that if op is high and bf isn’t,  its probably at least a little annoying"
/r/personalfinance would probably tell you to pay her and then charge her rent. 
A dude who has only been in her life for a year or less is not a close relative even if he was biologically related to her.
Because chicken was healthier than the pasta.
It would be an incredible violation for her to film him doing this and post it online for strangers to gawk at. He's already embarrassed that *she* knows he does it.
"&gt;What kind of father would I be if I was only seeing them on vacations and holidays?

Honestly, a shitty one. Especially it's literally just because you're choosing to have a job that you think you will like better. It would be another thing if you couldn't find a job to provide for your family in town and your wife also couldn't get a job. But nah, you have a perfectly good job, you just don't like it. Don't be that guy to leave his family for such a selfish reason."
"Yeah! I like this. If he says ""You have really nice hair!"" it's very natural for you to say ""You think so? It's actually a wig  haha, but thank you!"" "
"Needs trump wants.

If your partner can't see this, go to marriage counseling."
"I am so sorry you are being treated like this. I really hope what ever happens you get treated as you deserve that is as the wonderful person you are, you sound like such a loving compassionate person. I wish you all the best."
Yeah six months to start DATING is absolutely reasonable. If she was married abd pregnant after six months that would seem rushed but dating? No.
If he felt that resigning from this club was necessary to distance himself from this crush then it probably was. 
"Walk.  He's very manipulative and you can't see it.

He's not a victim, groomed at a young age into group sex, cheating and kink.  

That is, however, exactly what he's trying to do to you.

"
"&gt; She literally is letting this ruin her marriage

We've all run across people who feel like the wedding dictates the marriage. If the ceremony isn't ""perfect"", then neither is the partnership. But as you have so astutely pointed out with that single line, that tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"OP, seriously — show him the comments on this post. Maybe then he’ll get his head out of his ass?

Also, has he spent any time with your family? Maybe point out how different the vibe is and how that’s also a perfectly reasonable way to prefer to organize family time?

Finally, if you stay together, someday your nuclear family will be the center of some holidays, and/or you’ll be dragging your kids to his family’s stuff. You have to put your foot down now because you don’t want your future kids stuck in the same craziness."
"The fact that you think having a common hobby and getting on well with someone is sufficient to start questioning a long-term relationship should tell you all you need to know about whether or not you should marry your partner.

I've met plenty of neat people. I've met men that I jive really well with, to a degree where I'd probably consider going on a date with them if I was single. But not once have I considered breaking up with my partner just because I'm capable of getting along with men other than him.

&gt;I have recently been just getting bored with our texting conversations and whatever we talk about.

It goes both ways, you know. I strongly suspect you've made zero effort to try to make things interesting.

You have a lot of growing up to do, OP. And under no circumstances should you propose when you're this wishy-washy and uncertain."
"2-3 MAJOR pointers. He didn't like, give her a playful shove. He choked her. And he did it to someone else, and he fucking stabbed himself, and he will do it all again...and again and again, until either her life has been ruined or she is literally dead. It does not matter the quantity of infractions. This is an unequivocally abusive relationship."
Sounds like your wife is lucky she didn't get kicked by Vengeance. 
"Well, your attitude seems to be that your husband covers all the expenses and savings and your money is ""a bonus"". This might tick some people off. You are not seeing yourself as an equal partner sharing the responsibilities. Other possibility is that they are just jealous of your situation and would prefer to have the same but can't.


What you can try is to just wait stuff to calm down and avoid bringing up your situation. More confrontational approach is to always tell them their jokes are mean and hurtful when they are at it. "
"Yeah.... your ""jokes"" got old pretty fast. She was communicating to you that she wanted you to say a genuine nice thing to her and you ignored it and kept... joking.

I would say something along the lines of, ""Hey sorry about earlier. Truthfully I really enjoy your company,"" or something that doesn't seem like your just negging her."
I'm autistic and my holiday in Japan was wonderful.  I'm not into Japanese culture as a whole but their rules for social interaction thing was amazing!
"I think it's a bit out there to say it's the ex taking priority rather than her children. 

She litterally has two five year old children that have just been through their parents getting divorced. It's perfectly natural to want to keep normality for them around the holidays and want to spend the holidays with them. "
"You're leaving your current *stable* relationship for another man because he's offered a responsibility free lifestyle. That's the **exact definition** of *gold digger*.

If you're tired of worrying about money, what have **you** done to better your situation? I'd bet you've done as much as your boyfriend; absolutely nothing."
"You seem a little frantic. Just, breathe. You say yourself this may not even matter because you aren’t sure if you’ll qualify. So there’s no need to panic right now. 

Just tell your dad about the tournament and let him know that if you qualify you may have to miss the wedding. What he does in response is up to him. "
"That rubbed me the wrong way too. She leaves upset and he just lets her AND comes home acting like it was NBD, making jokes, mocking her feelings? I think this guy is being very disrespectful. Gaslighting is also emotional abuse. Disregarding her feelings, making her feel small. Idk but every guy I know who does this is a grade A douche. He has zero respect for her feelings."
"That's exactly my thought.  She agrees to let him come,  then he says it's wrong that she leaves him alone while she goes out and explores.  Then it starts to become a repeat of the first vacation. "
"You have extremely clinical sex in one position all the time and refuse to try anything new, including allowing her to touch you--something that most people do in situations when they are fully clothed, with no sexual undertones whatsoever. This IS an issue--human touch is a natural urge, especially in situations when you're naked with your partner.

In my opinion, therapy is mandatory for this. Go to therapy. Ask her to come with you when you feel comfortable with that. Take it seriously and take *her* seriously, for once. ""It's normal that I don't want you to touch me"" sounds extremely hurtful and I feel for her.

Edited to add: while she is being sexually neglected here, you also deserve to see how wonderful intimate sex actually is. The same position with minimal touching over and over is not intimacy. I hope you can get past this problem of yours and enjoy human contact in a fun, pleasurable, safe way."
"I don't think this relationship has much of a future to be honest.  Him telling his mother knowing how she feels about it is a severe violation of your trust in him to protect you and your feelings.  And if you two stay together long term and end up getting married they will always have this in the back of their minds and there is a good chance they will always resent you for it.  What you did was your decision to make and it sounds like it was the best decision at the time for you, and they have no right to mistreat you for it."
I hope you recognize that for the complete and utter bullshit that it is. Her words and actions don't remotely align. She is totally full of shit. You're a fling until she chooses to settle down.
"I know his mom was against it. But he’s said his mom was a nut case... she doesn’t seem to be too sharp. Lovely woman but not all the way there. I think he does think, since he’s never been sick then nothing will happen to anyone."
"Did she know she got those diseases, because if yes she not only risked transmitting an STD to you, she let you walk into them knowing that you would be infected and that is unforgiveable. 
Even more unforgiveable than not getting tested before possibly transmitting something(which is fucking unforgiveable already, imho).


The one thing here that's good is that the HPV that causes warts is not the same that causes cancer, so hey, at least your life isn't on the line here.

But still dude, holy fucking shit."
"I hate to sound like a dick here, but all the information you give suggests you aren't a fighter, but rather avoid conflict. 

You need to stand up to your mom. Make the choices in life you want to make, and inform your loved ones of those choices proudly. 

Don't hide anything or hold back. Now is the time to establish boundaries. "
"There is a difference between worrying about what people will think and being mad at the person without offering any support, which is what that sounded like. "
Agreed.  There's something wrong with this picture. 
"&gt; his toe FELL OFF

I just got a little dizzy"
ok but can't you get back into it? pausing for 2 minutes shouldn't ruin your day.
"You need to speak to an estate lawyer.  They'll help you sort out the legalities of all of this, settle any debts or issues he had, and make sure that you get everything filed and legalized properly.  

If you can't get in to see your counselor soon, could she give you a recommendation to see someone else on kind of an emergency basis?

Don't feel like you need to take on everything at once.  It's okay to take your time, to lean on other people, get overwhelmed once in a while, to take breaks, etc.  You don't need to superhero your way through this.  You and your brother also need to give the other one a lot of leeway, and try to convince him to find his own therapist and take the same breaks and slowness.

You can do this."
"OP said their mom isn't paying child support, maybe it's time someone added up what she owes in back payments? Things could get pretty ugly if it was part of the custody agreement. "
I don't normally encourage things like this but you should totally bring a guy over when hes around so that he can get his ass out ASAP and get over his selfish ass
"My younger sister would sleep in her parents room until she was about 8-9. She stopped sleeping in the bed itself at about 6. They just never told her no because they didn't want to deal with the crying. 

Fwiw, I definitely don't agree that toddlers should run the show. Just pointing out a perspective of just *how long* this can go on for."
"...Meg?

Kidding. I saw your other post, at least the weather was warm for yours. My friend went on an Alaskan cruise. Same shit though. Grandparents paid so they set everyone's agenda. All meals together. Excursions together. Nap time together. My friend had to stay in a separate room with her never to be sister-in-law because the idea of an engaged couple (WHO ALREADY LIVED TOGETHER) sharing a room was scandalous. "
"You can't convince her to leave, but you CAN convince her of how worried and afraid you are for her.  Be VERY CLEAR with how terrifying his actions are and how worried you are now.  Sometimes that's what can get through to a victim of abuse...seeing how a normal person they trust reacts to something that they have normalized."
"It's a new therapist which is probably why.  Weirdly, my anxiety in certain areas has improved greatly, but other areas are still troublesome.  I was out of therapy for a while before seeing him because of a change in insurance, so I feel like I'm starting from square 1.  He is focused on CBT actually, which is helpful!"
"My boyfriend is like your boyfriend (uh, except is a bit less judgemental and brute-ish). He's travelled with no plans in countries he doesn't know the language, slept on beaches, whatever. I'm more of a planner. Where are the hostels, where is transit. How much money do I have vs an emergency hotel room. What if my stuff gets stolen or I'm mugged. We have travelled together, and while there is some friction, it worked ok.


The key though is my bf recognizes and listens to my fears and concerns. While some people may find it prissy I wanted to stay in a private two person hostel room our first night in Bangkok, to me, it was for safety and to get familiar with the backpacking practices there. In Japan, I could go anywhere alone and never lock up my gear. Elsewhere, I've seen people mugged in plain site. My bf compromises with me because he knows my concerns are not rooted in being high maintenance, but in safety!  He doesn't want to travel with someone who's constantly paranoid and on edge. 


Your partner sounds like they're just expecting you to have the same world view as them, and is missing empathy towards your fears. I think you can compromise, but not without him actually hearing and taking in your feelings. Right now he just seems to be blocking them out with judgement and his feelings towards his past experiences. "
Routine colonoscopies and removal of minor growths may keep him from getting colon cancer. Not going for these every five years is foolish. 
"Haha, there are going to be a lot of dudes commenting who don't like the fact that being attracted to childlike characters is a red flag - but it totally is, and it's OK that you're uncomfortable with that. Personally I would dump a guy who was commenting about how he'd like to fuck a child. "
But if he also has enough money to save up and put in retirement and pay the bills I guess I don't get why this is a problem. Spending money poorly is only an issue when you can no longer also spend wisely.
"&gt;Okay, those aren't all that horrible. It was somewhat in jest for both of us.

IDK, I think both of those examples are fairly bad. You really went out and spent money on new work pants because he doesn't want you to wear tight ones? Also, he is not talking in jest anymore. He's basically trying to get you to admit you wanna fuck other men just so he would be right. If he isn't mature enough to see that his buddies wives being scumbags doesn't mean you are as well. I think you might be blaming his actions on that instead of accepting he may be a controlling ass. After only 6 months maybe you should move on.
"
"&gt;I've kept asking her for chances, trying to go through all the possible arrangements that can make us together such as a platonic marriage or being partners to raise an adopted child. 

That's not just harassment, that's *insane.* It's also disrespectful. It does not sound like you are capable of being friends without getting upset or putting pressure on her so you should distance yourself for a long while until you are totally over it, if you never are then just never recontact her. This woman is also a decade younger than you and your undue pressure on her, especially when you met her when she was even younger, is super predatory."
It's totally fine to have your preferences of what you want in a partner and stick to that.  But you have to realize you're extremely limiting your own dating pool and it's entirely likely you will never meet a woman who has all the traits you want.
"Ok listen to me.  I'm 34/f and single and have a great dating life.  People are settling down later in life especially in larger cities.  You need to get out of this very unfulfilling dead end relationship.  He sounds complacent and you are settling.  You need to get out now so you have a chance at meeting someone and having children eventually.  It's not fair to do to yourself or him to do to you.  You have ONE life to live and this is it it is happening right NOW.  Get out work on yourself you will feel exhilarated and fresh.  You can do it!!!!  Don't just stay with someone because you have invested time.  You need someone that will be inclusive of you.  You should be her step mom, he should have proposed if he was going to already, he should appreciate you... instead he just doesn't care and is taking you for granted!  Get out!  I wish I could shake you right now!!!!  Do you want to be 36 and just getting into the dating scene?  Get out now if you want a chance for yourself to have an amazing relationship and an amazing family and an amazing life!"
"But this was actually a birthday party for her adult brother, not explicitly a party only to see the baby.  I don’t think OP should be expected to assume that going to her brother’s birthday party will require her helping with the baby’s diapers."
"It wasn't. But what about love and honor? In sickness and in health? I'm not getting those from him. 

When my daughter was born we were in therapy because I didn't think he'd take time off to help me and I was scared I would end up with a c section and need the help. My parents were so worried they cancelled a trip so they would be there. He worked from the hospital and like many men was unhelpful at home so I was grateful he went to work 3 days later. "
He's posting here pretending it was his friend because he wants advice on how to fix the situation but is too ashamed to even admit to himself or internet strangers what he did. It's like when people go see their therapist but then lie and downplay their actions even though there's no one around to judge them. 
"I don't think that's fair.

The gf was 19-20 years old or so, very young, had only been in one relationship, and her bf was unemployed and unproductive. If she'd posted here, we'd have told her to dump him and move on, not waste her life on a lazy loser. 

She wasn't cheating on him. She broke up with him.  That's not at all equivalent to a dog biting a finger off."
"""Did he also tell you that he tried to grope me without my consent? I was freaked out so I took my chance to get away from him.""

If they take his side, fuck them. Either way, it wasn't your job to take care of him. The rest of the group ditched him too."
If she's into appearances is she really gonna cause a scene?
That's cheating! And it's up to you if you're okay with that or not.
"I would be pretty cross at the boyfriend in this scenario. The new friend is being thoughtless and overly flirtatious, but that wouldn't be an issue if the boyfriend was shutting it down. 

It sounds instead like he's loving the attention and isn't going to do anything to stop it. 

He's even trying to make this about you being a nagging girlfriend that won't let him have friends - just because you're not comfortable with him flirting all over a 23 year old in a bikini. 

I'd recommend putting more effort into your friendships - get out and have fun yourself, and make sure you have a decent support network in case this situation goes south."
"Saving kids from embarassment about an old car?  Really?  That's so ""keeping up with the Jones's"" and should be a time for  teaching them that appearances don't matter.

Yeah, the phone thing is annoying.  But i still feel that he shouldn't try to force her to change the one thing she's doing that she feels contributes to their family finances."
"You feel weird because he's pressuring you into sex by setting up weird, arbitrary rules around it."
"Why the hell does she want an apology from him? She should apologize TO him for trying to get on his horse without asking and then continuing to do so when he tried to kick her off. You can't get on a horse when it doesn't want it, it's not like taking a ride in somebody's car. She's actually lucky he came over and yelled at her to get off, because if she did get on and the horse bucked her off, she could have been seriously hurt"
"Exactly. But if he thinks I'm unfuckable at 135 lbs he's a picky asshole.
Even if I was the female Quasimodo I still would take a gargoyle over him any day."
"So true. My friend was on naked and afraid. He was on this island with this girl for something like two weeks. He told me things were pretty fun and they got along well. 

Well, the show was basically 40 mins of them fighting and crying and having a shit time of things. Over two weeks they got hundreds of hours of footage. It’s easy for them to pluck 40 mins of bullshit out of nearly 700 hours of everything in between.  "
"A friend and I talked about this fairly recently, comparing our perception of our parents when they were our age, vs how we feel ourselves at the same age. The difference is rather huge. Back then adults seemed to have their shit together, while now I'm realising a whole lot of us are doing all the ""adult stuff"" while waiting for the feeling of being a bonafide Adult to set in. The only difference I can tell for myself is that I feel increasingly comfortable with being me, but I don't feel ""adult"" the way I imagined it must be when I was younger. 

Although 5 years ago I laughed at the idea of marrying, cause I wasn't ready either, with no specific reason or timeline for why or when I might be."
"Two things you wrote here stands out to me. 1) Your needs and emotions have been deemed less important than caring for your brother your whole life, and 2) You have never had a good brother.

No 1 is common for siblings of children who are sick or addicted. It hurts. It's also exactly what your relative and parents are doing all over again. Talk to your parents about this. Tell them you are happy that they have their son back, but wheter he's an addict or sober they have prioritised his feelings over your well being and it's starting to have s real negative impact on your relationship with them. You need them to stand up for you to people who are telling you that your trauma doesn't matter as much as your brothers feelings and get them to back of (this includes their son) or it will effect how you interact with your family.

No 2 is a sad fact, which you can use to try to enwoke sympathy is people that are currently sympethisibg with him. When people pressure you to forgive him, then tell that that your brother has never been anything but abusive to you and that even if you do forgive him he is still a complete stranger to you with a history of abusing you. Forgiving him doesn't mean who will suddenly stop being afraid of him. Forgiving him don't mean you will want to have a relationship with what is essentially a complete stranger. Forgiving him don't mean you will suddenly start loving this person with whom you've never had a loving relationship. They say forgiveness but mean ""pretend nothing happened so we can play happy family"" but even forgiveness doesn't mean forget or family."
"If you ignore the negatives of any relationship it’s fine. You’re right, he knows his treating you that way upsets you *and he doesn’t care*. What do you honestly feel like you’ve been withholding from “the table” that you think his knowledge of might change his inability to acknowledge and care about your boundaries and desires? I suggest you get the ball rolling with “I can’t be in a relationship with someone who argues like a middle schooler, have a nice life without me in it”. If you’re *really* that hellbent on staying together, given him an ultimatum like “if you keep doing this I’m going to break up with you”. At that point though you have to follow through if he doesn’t stop (which he won’t, because he doesnt care). Also, ultimatum relationships almost never work. It would be far less of a hassle to break up and not spill a tear of this asshole. "
"He's a good husband. He isn't pushing me for sex.

He does initiate things sometimes. I'm worried if I open up about my feelings he'll feel like he can't be sexual with me at all and that could make things worse. He'll feel even more deprived and I'll feel like I'm doing even less. 

He has a high sex drive, so that knowledge is always on my mind. I know he's going without something he kind of needs in order to feel connected with me and it's making me anxious. "
"So instead of being a mature adult and ordering what she wants, she makes a martyr or herself and shames you for making healthy choices?

She sounds like a wonderful woman."
"&gt; Do you want to be with a person like this who will always look down on your family

this is indeed the bigger issue, of which Xmas is just a symptom"
"I think the issue is that SHE feels uncomfortable... she isn’t showing because he says she’s gross, she feels gross. Having sex when you feel unattractive is not fun. Doesn’t matter if the other person can’t tell the difference. "
"Honestly, I would just disappear."
"""I guess she moves on pretty quickly""

You dumped her 3 years ago. It's completely fair to start dating someone 6 months later.

From how bitter and angry you sound in this post (from something YOU did, not her), it's kind of obvious that you sent the texts.  Just leave her alone man."
"&gt; Then her husband (who was secretly on the phone the entire time) said that he didn't trust me anymore, I was no longer allowed in their house or trusted to be around their kid.

If they're going to record you without your knowledge and then pore over the recordings for evidence you've done something wrong, they never trusted you in the first place."
"I think your fiancé should look for jobs *before* you decide where to move. He can apply to jobs in a few different cities, and you can move if he gets a job that he’s excited about in a city you like."

Me too - it’s just good housekeeping and she might worry about kissing with bad breath.  Wish my partner wanted to tickle my hair all night .. or my hands that would be awesome 
"I don't think your mom is overly sensitive. I think she pretends her feelings are hurt whenever you call her out on her behavior, like stealing money from you or yelling at your sister. "
"He is literally slandering you, and you want to work on communication?

I mean communication is great, but it doesn't fix someone being willing to ruin your reputation with lies."
"&gt;though I don't know if he is- this might be a case of telephone, with the rest of your family interpreting for him

Despite wanting to make reparations with everyone, he has yet to directly contact me. According to my parents/everyone else, his logic is that he's ""afraid"" of me because I told him I wish he died 8 years ago. It was apparently traumatic enough to him that he's scared of talking to me anymore. That's pretty rich considering all of the things he's said and done to me over the years, but I guess I can't know for sure what effect my words had on him. 

Anyways maybe the rest of the family is playing telephone, but all I know everyone is now urging me to make the ""first"" apology so we can all hug and make nice and move on. Everyone is trying to convince me that as long as I make this first move and convince him I don't still hate him, he can feel safe enough to apologize to me. So, by refusing to make this first move, I'm the petty/bitter sibling who won't allow our family to heal. "
"This really gets me because I feel the same way. 

When I was a kid, I never liked other kids my age. 
As I grew older, I realized I just don’t enjoy kids or the various stages of human development. And while I would never deliberately mistreat a child, my indifference to them can be read as cold or cruel. I don’t have that innate sense of nurturing that others seem too, and I am ok with that. My strengths lie elsewhere. All of this factored into my decision to not have kids. I don’t feel bad and neither should you. It takes all kinds of people to make the world go round. "
"Have your SO talk to her. Something strange happened, she took the laundry in the dryer as some sort of sign that she should clean your entire space, why did that happen? Can she understand that you both don't want her combing through all of your stuff? Is there some practical solution to restore your privacy, such as putting a lock on the door, or building a laundry room that is separate from your apartment?

Again, your SO needs to sit down with her and discuss all these things, and he has to make clear this is coming from both of you, and not blame it on you."
Even if it's just for my moms sake I hope so too. Thanks
"So what if it's hard to meet other guys in your town, better to be alone than with someone who pulls crap like burping in a comatose elderly lady's face. Unbelievable. "
"I date someone who was really generous with her money, but also took her sweet time paying back loans. And it was *fine* that she was that way, but I needed $50 back so I could pay a bill and she wanted to wait three weeks so she could go to a concert. Relationship ended real quick."
"The dog isn't the problem. 

Your bf is.

I seriously hate dog owners like him.

He wants the ""cool"" looking dog without being willing to actually care for it.

" This is amazingly annoying and petty, and might work. I love this idea"
"Since you guys are working around your symptoms have you tried to avoid 100% spontaneous sex?


Don't get hot and heavy randomly. Or if you do don't pin your heats desire on sex.


Instead you take showers and then you initiate a make out session. Your shower can be Pavlov's sex bell for your husband.


This is just a short term solution until, well until whenever life gets back to normal after a newborn. "
"OK, this screams run a mile.

OP, you may well have fucked up but you don't have to be a martyr to your own relationship for it.

Recovery is about honest expression and being emotionally available to each other. What he is doing is punishing you until he's no longer angry - which, frankly, could take forever. You're playing rope-a-dope while he unleashes into you, and telling yourself it's ok because you deserve it.

He has the right to be hurt, and to be upset. He doesn't have the right to opt to continue the relationship and use it as an opportunity to punish you for your transgression.

After the litany of cruelty which you outline, this particular phrase hit me quite hard:

&gt; I feel like I ruined our relationship. Like everything would be perfect if (....)

Surely you jest. Bullying - and it is bullying - you on account of your sexual history, for which you **are not accountable to anyone else**? Manipulating your emotions through vengeful dinner-dates? Continually stabbing you with your infidelity, not as a productive discussion but as personal catharsis? Relationships work depending on how well people can manage difficulty. Quite frankly, he's managing this like a child and you need to leave before you reconsider.

&gt; Not sure how to salvage the relationship when I feel like I'm already putting in 100% of my effort.

I'm not sure why you would want to."
"It's not mind reading to know that when your partner's father has a stroke you should offer comfort. It's not mind reading to know that your first response to your partner crying isn't ""What if the neighbors think I'm hitting you."" This excusing of a lack of  basic human empathy is insulting to men who aren't emotionally stunted."
"some people can't travel together because of differences in how much they like to have things planned out or not, but this is on another level. your boyfriend is insane.

&gt; There is no reason to go there with no money when we could at least save up. 

*completely agree with you.*

i've done what most people would consider a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants 10-day solo trip as a 20sF in a foreign country where english wasn't spoken everywhere before, but i always had shelter planned at least early that day, if not the day before. and i always ate- whether it was with friends i made or at a restaurant on my own, because food is important and delicious.

i did not rely on other people unless i absolutely had to. ""planning"" to do that for an entire trip is crazy- it should 100% be the last resort. if you have money, why would you not use it to ensure your own well-being?!

i also definitely agree with other posters about your boyfriend being completely ignorant to how much more dangerous homelessness and relying on strangers is for women."
"IMHO, (sorry to be blunt) if she ends the friendship over this issue, then the friendship is not worth saving.  I say this because she valued the yoga trip more than your friendship.  She knew that you couldn't go, but she still went anyway and used this situation to cause a rift between the two of you.  

You tried your best to save the situation.  Now it is up to her to contact you.  Cherish the good memories you have of your friend and move on and make other friends regardless of what she does."
"It would be a mistake leaving everything to David.  He lacks motivation, won't work and won't take care of himself.  The money will quickly be gone with little to show for it.  I have always believed that parents should share money among all children equally, unless one of them really doesn't deserve anything.  "
"I think you should insist that he get a mental and physical evaluation.  It could be a lot of things, illness mental or otherwise, or he could have just lost control of himself this one time and didn't stop.  Whatever it is, he needs to be thoroughly checked out.  

Is there anything else lately that you now look back on that you thought was off, but didn't think much of it?  Is there anything different going on in his life? Any changes lately? Anyone die recently?  Anything going on at work?  Any extra pressure financially?  "
"What does your husband contribute to your life? Other than stress, horrible communication methods, anger issues, and completely alien cultural standards, you haven't mentioned anything positive. It doesn't sound like you should continue with this relationship. You've got a promising future as a med student -- don't let your husband or his family get in the way of that!"
"Am girl. She’s right. My guy doesn’t cook but his cleaning skills are out of this world, and I really appreciate him on a day to day level because of that, among other things! "
"Yes! There is often a big difference between being ""nice"" and being ""kind."" Nice often entails being inoffensive, and never making waves or a scene. Kind means standing up for others, even if it means you take some heat from it. Kind means generous, not because you are guilted into it, but of a real motivation to help others. 


I have often noticed ""nice"" people have no problem inconveniencing others, or throwing them under the bus, in order to work around a pushier, angrier person. So they're not always kind, they just pick the path of least confrontation, even if it means other people pay the price. OP's husband is being nice to his friends, but he is not being kind to his wife.

OP, if you are having a hard time with confrontation, how about this idea? You have already talked to him multiple times, so I don't feel this is passive aggressive, or out of the blue. You simply pack your bags, when he's not there,  and they are not all over the place, seeing you, and leave. Go to a hotel, go to your family's house, or wherever. Don't let him see you and stop you before you go. You need to be out of the house so he knows you are serious. You then tell him, when he notices and asks, ""I've told you multiple times I am done with this. I'm not bluffing. I will not be returning to the home while they are there. This is your responsibility to take care of. I would have been glad to help you earlier,  but you've made it clear you have no intention of handling it, so I can't really do anything else. This is not up for debate. There is no option C anymore. You can have them there, or me, but not both. No, I'm not coming over to talk about it, we've been talking about it for months. The discussion is over. I'm not coming home so you can try to guilt me or lie to me anymore.""

Then stick to it. I would not normally do this, but you have already talked and talked and talked. At this point in time, your discomfort is easier for him to deal with than confronting them, so he's banking on you ""coming around"" one more time. People are owed an explanation for things like this usually, but you can seriously cannot talk anymore. My fear is that if you do this, he will somehow get you back home, make you the bad guy, and have them stay. You have to absolutely stick to it.

I would even suggest counseling at this point, even if and when they leave. I would feel so uncertain after this happened, that I would have to do something like that to be respected in my own home. This is ridiculous."
"I wonder if you're my mom's ex-boyfriend's ex-wife.  At first she liked how goofy and funny he was, but quickly lost patience when he would make loud racist jokes at parties but think it was okay because he ""hit every race equally.""  

I'm super socially awkward (or at least I was) but generally never veered into racist/sexist/homophobic territory.  If I did, it was purely accidental (like when I asked my korean coworker when Chinatown markets closed...not because she was Asian but because she had lived in our city for a lot longer than me...she didn't believe my reason though!)"
"I am a woman. I would not (and have not in the past) cared about a partner’s porn consumption. But that’s just me.

Your wife’s aversion is understandable. Your agreement to not consume porn while in a relationship with her was made under the assumption that you’d be having sex on a regular basis. Things have changed now. She’s in therapy but that’s stalled out. You aren’t looking to cheat. You’re looking to satisfy your sexual desires while she’s working this out. No porn AND no sex? It feels unreasonable. 

Maybe lay all this out with the therapist. If she doesn’t budge it may be an irreconcilable incompatibility."
"What has this got to do with you?

This is between the groom and the bride.  Bride needs to set boundaries with MIL, her mom.  If Groom wont stand up for himself and wont get Bride to stand up for him, that's his problem.

You have no part of this."
"I don't think anyone is gonna try and argue that. Mostly because this isn't a ""history"" thing, it's currently ongoing."
"&gt; My wife means the world to me. 

She didn't mean enough to keep you from fucking some other woman, did she?

Serious question, before this happened were you one of those people that kept shitty boundaries with others because ""I'd never cheat on my wife!""?"
"Kelly's reaction? In what sense? 
How's she the worst? Alice is the one that pursued her sister's fiance?

Yes Bob made a choice and so did Alice., even if Bob wasn't Kelly's, it doesn't mean Alice should have gone after him while they were still engaged (or at all actually).  

She's not a unforgiving hard-ball at all. That's a huge assumption based on one really tough betrayal."
"&gt; I strongly encourage him to go to counseling on his own...

This.

OP: you didn't do anything wrong. Your boyfriend's friend lied to him and for whatever reason, he chose to believe his friend over you and ended your relationship.

The mere fact that he's proposing that you go to couples counseling to address this suggests that he really hasn't figured much out."
"Please plan an Intervention with a possibility for rehab. 

You have a family together. Get the family and her closest friends involved. This is a huge problem. If she’s going to this extent to drink, she could hurt herself, you, the baby, or all of you unintentionally. If she wants to get pregnant and keep building a life and family with you, the habit has to go. No casual drinking. It needs to go. Please I encourage you to do this, alcohol is so dangerous. 

Alcohol killed my mother a month before we had her intervention planned almost ten years ago. I do not like seeing others go down the black hole of alcoholism. 

Good luck to you. "
"You definitely have some issues with anxiety, but it's not cool or helpful that he repeatedly promised to Uber and then changed his mind and did whatever else he wanted to instead, leaving you to worry and wonder.

It sounds like for his personality, he might need nights once in a while where he doesn't know his plans, doesn't need to communicate them and just has the freedom to be spontaneous and do whatever. 

Do you think that if you guys scheduled those nights a few times a year, and you committed to just being out of touch that night and seeing him the next day (or earlier), that you could get through that with the help of your therapist?

It probably won't.

"Okay, but cats are suuuuper communicative. I've basically learned how to understand what my cat is trying to say through their body language, so when I talk to my cat, I can usually get some sort of response from it.

It's not a great conversation though. More ""Do you like this? No, that hurts? Okay, I'll do this. Is that better? Yes? Good. Do you like this food?"" My husband calls me Dr. Doolittle."
"Honestly now that I know about her finances I'm finding it hard to justify loaning her more money or even helping her with groceries. She makes more than enough money to support herself, and her exorbitant pet costs are literally the only thing forcing her to beg for money. It makes me more mad to think she bought her most recent cat only 5 months ago, when she surely had the same money issues. I just can't believe she's been living so irresponsibly.

I feel like I've already pointed out the obvious to her and I'm no longer getting involved. I'm just upset that she feels it's okay to treat me like this after everything I've done and sacrificed for her in the past."
Why do you even want to be with him? Seriously.

Tell her she has options. 

1.  You get a hotel room and either *she* goes to be by herself for R&amp;R. Or...  *you* go so you're out of her hair while she gets time alone without the need to take care of you, hence she gets R&amp;R.

2.  You save $ by skipping the hotel room and she lets you fulfill your vows of ""In sickness and health.""

Obviously it's a silly proposal but at this point you've tried reasoning with her many times without success. Time to try a new approach. "
Evil like that doesn’t just go away with a steady girlfriend and a clean pee test. 
"""Seeing the baby"" does not in any way, shape, form, or fashion imply agreeing to provide baby maintenance.  That is absolutely ludicrous. My friends that come and ""see"" my Mustang are not obligated to change the oil in it. "

"This may be ADHD, but who cares at this point. I have ADHD too. A big thing about ADHD, especially in adults, is that emotions are the most powerful motivators. We can concentrate, even overfocus, on the things we love. Planning meals is hard, but slicing a banana and making a pbj sandwick is easy. Saving the life of a child who has fallen into the pool is easy. Taking a screaming child who is in excruciating pain to the urgent cate or ER is easy. These don't involve planning and executive functioning--they involve reaction.

"Wtf? Choking is not okay, even as a joke. There is a lot of research on how choking in a relationship is often a warning sign that the abuse will escalate to murder. You should take this very, very seriously.

You say he's never shown signs of abuse before, so maybe it's some kind of mental breakdown. For now, the explanation doesn't matter, you just need to prioritise your safety.

Get out now. Stay with friends or family. If you don't have anyone nearby, look up LoveIsRespect.org for domestic violence resources."
"In future try to ask more than the number of people you need for references (ie if you need 3 ask 4). People will generally be faster with letters once they've written for you once. It's also possible to use services like interfolio where they can have generic letters on file.

I don't know if you have but always send your cv with requests and/or something like bullets points that relate to the key info that needs to be in a letter (ie if one letter is supposed to speak to leadership then send a bullet point list of leadership related things you've done, if one is mostly academic include a transcript, the tile of your major paper for their class, etc.)"

"This x100. If he was in his 30s or 40s, I'd understand why the gf is stressing. But he's only in his early 20s and is just figuring out adulthood. If I'd married my long-term bf back when I was OP's age, I'd probably be divorced now because I'm quite different now (in my late 20s) than I was back then. Nothing has really changed in terms of my lifestyle, but my mind feels more 'adult' and I think I'm ready to settle down and maybe even have kids. Granted, this is only my own personal anecdote, but we see so many people on this sub who marry way too young and slowly grow apart as they get older and learn what sort of adults they want to be."
"&gt; She asked to visit us and stay in our guest room Friday-Monday. Because we have plans on Friday night and for the day on Saturday he counter-offered to just Saturday-Sunday. She responded that it wouldn't be worth it to come at all, and decided not to come. We're also already committed to visiting his parents for five days over Thanksgiving and then again at New Years so we didn't feel that trying to squeeze a visit in was necessary.
He's never told his mom ""no"" like this before. My MIL has a habit of being passive aggressive and holding grudges. I asked my BF how our request was received, and he responded that for the first time in years, his mom did not end the call with ""I love you"". To add to the dilemma, my BF is an engineer and social cues, especially passive ones, can really be lost on him. I wasn't a party to the conversation so I don't know first hand but he thinks everything's fine.

Look. This is the ideal outcome. You defined your boundary, she agreed, end of story. She doesn't *have* to be happy about it, she just has to abide by it. Don't complicate things by stressing out over whether she passive aggressively withholds affection over setting a boundary (not ending the phone call with ""love you""-- give me a break). She can pout and sulk all she wants. She'll lick the wounds to her pride and get over it eventually."
"&gt;...I decided to take abit of a sexual approach without really being sexual....I sent her a picture right after I got out of the shower and when I had wrapped myself in a towel. ...using the drawing function on my phone I drew a big penis that was laying across the floor 

So sending her a picture of you in a towel, with a fake penis drawn on is your idea of *not* being really sexual? Because, um... yeah, that's a big old fail right there.

&gt;No response.
A couple of hours later I sent her a new message saying:

And we get to your next mistake! Sometimes, people are away from their computers or not looking at their phones for hours at a time. Some people don't check messages for *days* even. 

When you sent your ""sexy-but-just-kidding-but-not-really-kidding faux-cock shot, and she didn't reply right away, you really should have just let it go for a while. By sending a second message, you're coming across as pushy and needy.

&gt; But the following day (friday) I wanted to ask her out so I ...

asked her out? Said ""hey, can we get together for a date?"" Suggested a specific time and place to meet? No. Of course not! You:
&gt;...sent her a playful message saying:
Where you the girl I just saw wandering around town aimlessly with her face glued to the phone? ;)

It doesn't sound like she responded to your last **two** messages, which means she got three messages in a row:

""Hey, here's a fake dick pick! Funny, right? There's money, and a fake penis! Isn't that funny, but also sexually suggestive in a non-threatening way? Because women love money and big dicks! That's the joke!""

""Hey, respond to my dick pick and joke, or I'll call an ambulance to go to your house, because I know where you live, and the only reason I can accept for why you won't respond to me is because you're dying. I'm kidding! But seriously, I want you to respond and I know where you live.""

""Hey, I think I saw you in town, but didn't come up or say hello or interact with you like a person. Instead, I thought I'd send you a message saying I think I saw you but that you didn't see me, because that's not creepy at all! Ha ha! Isn't it funny to joke about stalking and being stalked?"""
"As a man, I thought the arm thing was pretty bad, but somewhat understandable. But, taking off his shirt? Especially after you two have talked about this before? Totally disrespectful. "
Would you say these guys were probably the type of guys that wouldn't have much luck with women? I'm just trying to work out why they thought you were flirting with them when you were very adamant that you weren't. Because if they are the type of guys that aren't that good looking or are average then any type of attention they receive from women that is more than politeness they will consider to be flirting.
"So she uses your fear of her temper tantrums to get what she wants. She sounds like a peach.

"Can I just say I'm so immensely fucking proud of you for reporting them? I grew up in similar circumstances and my BIGGEST regret was not getting CPS involved. I'm the oldest of six and as much therapy as I've been through, I still feel it's MY FAULT for not doing a better job of protecting my siblings by getting the authorities involved. You're a truly strong person.

And look, they've got a completely different idea of what a healthy parent/child relationship is - and they're wrong. Your dad is human garbage for laying a finger on you. If they didn't want to be treated like criminals, they shouldn't have behaved like criminals.

Also the one time I tried to reach out for help (my dad beat me so badly I burst an eardrum) I was berated for 'betraying' and 'breaking up' the family. It took me YEARS to realise that no - this wasn't a family worth keeping together. 

Again, please don't feel like you're the bad guy here. Create distance - get independent. Create a safe space for your bro to escape to until he can move out with you. You're really brave.  "

Your responses seem to indicate you’re 100% on Kelly’s side so I have to ask why you wrote for advice?
"Holy hell I love this response. Not that the ""friends"" of OP would dare say the same thing to her face, of course. "
"Wow. Guy is a massive creep, and it doesn't sound like you will get much help from the owner of the house. 

Can you stay at any friends some nights? Are you able to go to the library/gym/a coffee shop, just to minimise possible exposure? 

Don't leave anything personal out in your room. If I were you, I would keep any intimate items (underwear, hairbrushes, makeup, perfume) in a box inside a suitcase underneath my bed/inside a box in the wardrobe/ somewhere away from prying eyes and hands. 

Do not tell him you are thinking about moving out, as he might escalate his behaviour. He also probably knows he creeps you out, and may get some sort of kick from it. If I were you, I would try not to give him any kind of reaction or hint that I found him creepy. 

Do you have any male relatives who can come over? Not constantly or to threaten this guy, but it is best he knows you have people around you. Do you have any male friends who can pose as a cousin/brother? I wouldn't say as a boyfriend because that might act as a weird trigger. 

Had a quick look, and on the English Amazon there is a product called Howsar Quick Lock. It's a temporary lock you could use when inside your room, so that you don't wake up one night with Creepo standing over your bed with a sheet of paper in hand. 

Reading this made me worry for you, so please do update in 3 months when you are safe and out of his reach!

&gt;When we got in bed, I said, ""hey, for future reference, it's hard for me to ask for support but -"" and he cut me off by saying ""yeah you already mentioned that, *I don't want to stay up till 5am talking when we have things to do tomorrow [Saturday].""*


You’re ignoring this part of the story which pretty much negates everything you’ve said. She did try to communicate and tell him what she needed and he cut her off like an asshole. Let’s not even get into the fact that you shouldn’t have to explain to your partner that you need support when your father has had a serious medical incident and you’re crying in front of him. You’re being way too hard on op and giving her partner way too much benefit of the doubt. "
"&gt; And when they go to college, they’ll remember that you snuck them some soda way back when and they’ll bring you weed.

This was the exact thought running through my head as I read this. She definitely doesn’t need to know that her new surgery that gives her more confidence and makes her happy about her appearance is the reason why she got broken up with.
"It's all about listening and communication, really. If one of those ""cool girls"" seriously wanted a cheap ring and no proposal, but their fiance gave them a horribly expensive ring and huge, public display of affection? They would be pissed off too!

For me, I told my boyfriend that we can pick out a ring, and I want something that will last a lifetime (since I'll be wearing it every day) but nothing expensive. I don't want to wear a mortgage payment on my finger! As for the proposal, I told him that whatever he does, keep in mind that we'll be re-telling the story for years to come so don't put the ring on the tip of his dick or whatever. I trust that he'll listen to me, but if the proposal involves his wiener in any way, I'll have no problems asking him for a re-do."
"They ""dated"" for two weeks when they were in high school.  this is the least threatening ""ex"" to ever exist.  No, ""an ex is an ex"" is not a universal blanket anything.

It's an *online book club*.  That's about the most innocuous activity it is possible to engage in.  

She *wants you to join too*.  When someone is planning to cheat on you (with the guy she dated for a week a decade ago, through salacious novels apparently), the last thing they do is *invite you to join in*.  

No, you're being rather ridiculous about this, and frankly rather immature.  Are you normally this insecure?"
"I can simplify it for you: Treat her like a human being. 

The guy OP is talking about is not doing that. He's putting her on a pedestal which is idealizing her which is objectifying her. It's not genuine and he can't really see her for who she is. Imagine talking to someone face to face and they seem to think they're making eye-contact, but from your point-of-view they're talking to your right ear. It's unsettling.

Practice empathy and recognize the women you're attracted to are flesh and blood humans, like you, with a rich interior life, like you, and all sorts of thoughts and preferences and sensitivities, like you. Proceed accordingly."

"&gt;I told her that is what a friends with benefits is all about someone you hook up with to get your rocks off and then go back to your own life.

I don't think that's the standard interpretation for FWB... That's more of a fuckbuddy / booty call.  

Friends with benefits means that there is some friend component too... you're not in a relationship but you do social things together also."
"&gt;I hate that he uses me this way.

Then you should say so. Tell him, to his face, that if Jason acted like Daniel does, then you wouldn't be respectful because he doesn't deserve respect. 

Silence might as well be agreement."
"Your parents enable his behavior. Letting him stay out all night without consequences, run up the phone bill, your Mom helping him cheat on exams and taking his verbal abuse. 

Also, your parent's are abusive towards you as well:

&gt;Even now, a week off 18, I am regularly slut shamed by my parents for spending time with my boyfriend

That is not okay.

There's nothing you can do unless your parents come to the realization that they're enabling your brother's behavior. 

Distance yourself from your family as much as you can until you leave to go to university. Try and find somewhere else to study if you can't focus at home. Don't engage with your brother and his behavior. You can't help him, and you can't help your parents help him as they're enablers. "
"This comment is really gross and I'm going to quote you because I think you may try to delete it after you're called out enough. ""If you have nothing, you can't pay anything."" You then go on to suggest that OP hides his income (possibly through working with another friend or family member to receive his income) to make this happen. 

I get that he was responsible in trying to prevent pregnancy. That absolutely 100% does not change the fact that his wife got pregnant and that he is GOING TO BE A FATHER. Responsibility and careful planning does not absolve him from parental duties. To suggest this is to punish the child, who didn't ask to be born in the first place, but deserves to have two parents. 

Take some time to consider your suggestion and I hope that you will see that nobody, ever, for any reason, should try to avoid parental responsibilities. And yes, that includes financial ones via child support. "
She's 11 weeks pregnant and you've already gotten paternity test results? That's *possible* but it's expensive. 
Every single person in this thread has told you that you are not over-reacting and she is being horrible to you.
"As cold and calculating as it sounds, I think the aunt is the better ally in this to deliver the letter. She's still in contact, knows how OP feels and can support and talk to her brother in ways his children can't."
"&gt; I can't imagine him actually attempting to kill me

Before that happened, could you have imagined him choking you?

Before that happened, could you have imagined him saying ""too bad"" when you told him he was hurting you?

Before that happened, could you have imagined him doubting your word and demanding to see proof? 

Before that happened, could you have imagined him pretending like nothing really happened and it was all no big deal?

Yes, you're losing touch with reality. He's gaslighting you - rewriting what actually happened with his own version so that you start to doubt your own reality. THAT'S what's happening."
"He became hostile because he knows it’s illegal &amp; wrong. He doesn’t post about her because, again, he knows that shit is illegal. 

So does her friends and family know about him? 

You need to report him to CPS or the police or what have you. He’s a sexual predator. "
I’d be so proud if my kids did that!
"If you recognize that it's blackmail then you shouldn't be engaging in it. Block her on everything, she already posted her key back to you, and get out of this relationship before she anchors herself to you even further.

If you're lucky this'll resolve itself when she realizes you aren't at her beck and call anymore. But please stop going back and doing the same thing over and over expecting something to change - as long as you're in contact with her, it won't. Get out of this abusive relationship and be more careful next time."

"No supporting/agreeing with that decision isn't the same thing as ""I will cut off all contact with you if you continue to speak to XYZ person I no longer speak to."" Kelly doesn't have the right to dictate who her parents or other people in her family speak to. 

I have some experience with this as I haven't been in contact with my abusive mother for over 2 years. It would never occur to me to demand that others in my family do the same or hold our relationship or their relationship with my daughter over their head as a threat to stop seeing her. Kelly is in the wrong here. "
I'm childfree and I really don't like children but a child's life trumps any marriage in my opinion. This is a risk I would definitely take. There are ways the husband could find out though. Medical history for one and tests for antibodies.
"&gt;  it was hard not to

What, because you're 13 and don't have any self-control when it comes to women?"
"I am seeing a therapist, my next appointment is on monday so I will definitely bring this up then. We have talked about Dave a lot, but this adds a whole new.. Thing.

After reading all these comments, I will call CPS regardless of what the mother wants. However, I dont feel comfortable involving the police unless she agrees to.

Thank you so much for your advice! "
I think therapy together is the best solution for this. 
"Probably to the benefit of the child, if she's so focused on appearances she's not going to let OP go to the funeral unless she caves to her demands."
"I like this update, good for you I'm glad you enjoyed it! :)"
"Ugh it was HORRIFIC. And I've no doubt that if we'd just been engaged still we would've had separate rooms and I would have gotten stuck with someone I actively hated at the time. All dinners together, all excursions, even all shore time until I told my husband I just wanted to spend some time alone with him. They got mad at me when I booked a massage one morning while they were off the boat (FUCK YOU I'M GONNA SPEND MY TIME WITH A NICE SWEDISH LADY WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT MY COMFORT). It was like my punishment for accepting their generosity, because of course this is a family where all gifts have strings attached.

I've since stopped caring what they think because they're all toxic and awful anyway. The last Christmas we spent with them (and luckily we're in the same town so it wasn't like we were stuck there) I just got up after breakfast and gift opening, went in another room and listened to music and browsed tumblr. "
"Imho, forgiving him isn't a high rode. Going NC with him, getting yourself help, and bettering your life without his shitty ass in it would be. Especially as I don't see how him being in your life even a little is going to help at all."

Your heart is a fucking idiot. Listen to your head.
"On this, You may want to ask your husband what kind of friends he is keeping.... I understand that he’s been friends with this guy for so long but people do grow apart on the financial scale. If I lived for 3 months without paying rent or utilities and just had to pay for food (I’m assuming) and my personal bills (car, insurance, etc) that right there is FLS so what’s their issue now??"
"&gt;I'm not entirely sure what is okay and what isn't in a relationship.

Which is precisely why a lot of older people deliberately go after much younger partners; their inexperience allows for them to accept behaviours that others would not tolerate. 

I’m nearly 30. The thought of dating someone your age is unthinkable to me. The thought of dating someone *his* age is unthinkable to me. "
"Yet another voice chiming in. Ladies, did we all date the same guy? I started out confident and happy and by the time he was done with me two years later I was a ghost of who I'd been.

Run now OP, it will only get worse. Mine finally crossed the line from jealously trying to control what I wore, what I did with my free time, who I saw, where I worked to hitting me. That was when I woke up and left. Don't wait that long. It's not worth it. No one is worth what it does to you emotionally and then physically if you let it continue. "
"&gt; but I just want to have a normal wedding.

As others have pointed out, this is massively insulting &amp; narrowminded. You’re saying that the way you do things is “normal” &amp; the way her culture does things is “not normal.” If you’re planning to marry someone from a different country / religion / culture, you had better broaden your worldly knowledge to realize that everyone believes their own way of doing things is the “normal” way. 

You two need to back it way up &amp; talk about how both of you see the entirety of your futures together. Finances, children, gender roles &amp; division of labor, importance of family, where you want to live permanently &amp; how often you’ll visit the other partner’s country, on &amp; on. You’ve made a very dangerous assumption that, because your fiancée agreed to move to your country, she would just stop being Israeli / Jewish &amp; assimilate right into UK norms. If you keep assuming that, you’re in for some rude awakenings on other big issues you don’t realize yet that you don’t agree on. “I celebrate Hanukkah now!” is one little thing you do to carry on her traditions. It’s not THE compromise you made &amp; she’ll meet you the rest of the way. "
Hippo time? Lmao that is so cute. 
"I'm going to wild-ass guess your hubby saw something he wasn't supposed to see when he dropped the clothes off. The most obvious thing would be evidence of cheating. They agreed to handle it between them and keep it that way, but the result was a fight. 

I'd put them in the same room and shake the jar and see what happens. Put them on the spot with questions, and see if one cracks in front of the other. "
"But has she agreed that she absolutely has to change? You said she freaked out again even though she doesn't have pregnancy hormones flowing through her bloodstream. Is she willing to see a therapist? 

You sound like you've put up with more from her in a matter of weeks than many couples *combined* tolerate throughout their entire relationships. This is not good. Are you perhaps overlooking how well your wife treats you in general? "
"I know she's the right woman for me. I guess I just don't feel mature enough for it yet? Even though on paper I'm prepared to be a husband and provider, I guess I don't feel completely there mentally? I have communicated this with her, but I don't really have any concretes other than that, and that's what worries her. She sees that I've made progress in many areas of my life, but this part is staying the same."
"I meant that as a mom choosing to leave her emotionally abusive husband, her working out a daily visiting schedule and keeping things calm and not court ordered is generous. He could be working through a lawyer to see his kid right now and he's not - and only because she has been able to separate their past negative relationship as partners from his relationship as the kids father - which is incidentally the very idea he's not respecting. "
"When men and women have sex, it’s not like they need it RIGHT NOW all the time and if they don’t get it RIGHT NOW they won’t/can’t want it 10 or 15 minutes later. That happens all the time, especially to people that have kids or other responsibilities. We are adults, we can control ourselves and put off pleasure for just a bit. To say otherwise is a little immature. "
You are doing everything right. You probably can't get her out of your head because you JUST cut contact with her. Maybe even block her from everything and don't go to the places you'd normally see her at.
Same. I would fucking ruin anyone who did this to my innocent animals. You'd have a hard time keeping me from beating the shit out of the person who did it--jail time would be fucking worth it. I don't understand why OP doesn't seem more angry.
"I kind of disagree. I think she should keep him in ignorance.

If she tells me it's because he's cheating, he'd think ""*well, that makes sense*"". If she doesn't, the idea that something might actually be wrong with him *as a person*, it will shake him up and he might examine himself for once. "
"This is physical abuse. 

If it were just a drunken incident, and then he were mortified once sobered up and promised never to get that drunk again, and then if he stayed true to his word and never again got that drunk or mentioned your choice to remain sober, then you would have a chance of working this out. 

However, in the morning, he doubled up and tried to justify himself. In other words, he has no respect for your choices or bodily autonomy. **He assaulted you and thinks he has the right to do so**. 

Yeah, this is physical abuse, and he is unrepentant. This is not going to stop unless you protect yourself. 

In other news, he clearly has a pretty fucked relationship with alcohol, so there's that. Do you really want to be married to an alcoholic? "
"True, that is exactly what I feel is going through his brain. Will try to talk this through."
"Stop debating. Stop engaging. Focus and redirect all conversation to conversations that are not politically charged. If he gets into it, say, ""That hurts my feelings and I would prefer not to speak about it,"" or ""I don't want to talk about this right now,"" and change the topic.

You need to focus on your health first and foremost. I know you want to tell him exactly where to shove it, but getting into arguments that exhaust you and cause you personal pain isn't beneficial for you. Wait until you're out of their house and feeling better to actually engage in these kinds of conversations. 

I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you feel better."
Why are you reposting this?
"Well, you obviously know something is fishy. I don't see why you're putting up with his behavior. You know that what he's been saying to you is bullshit."
"You're not overreacting.

Also, my husband lost a toenail recently, and it's not uglier than toes generally are.

It absolutely involves you, it concerns you, because you are married to each other."
"I agree...I think my advice is more in the vein of trying to minimize further damage to OP and her family. This is going to be scary for her husband, and anger on OP's part is more likely to make him lash out against her. She deserves compassion, too, but probably isn't going to get it from him. OP, I also recommend seeing a counselor ASAP."
"Even in kid friendly places, there is some etiquette expected. As a kid, I hated going to the movies with my little sister because she would talk constantly."
"""She controls the money, the home, forced our child based on her timetable with an ultimatum ...""

I doubt there's a physical or emotional affair. Sounds like he just wants a a friend. This other woman probably pities his predicament more than anything. "
"&gt;Some of David's messages read, ""you know the only reason I'm coming to New York is to see you. I don't even want to go to the event."" Also, David sent me a text when I left earlier to go spend the night with Andrew, he texted, ""don't leaveeeee. I'll hate you if you do. Come back and hang with me :)"" Andrew also read the text of David inviting me to stay at his hotel room.


Those are incredibly suggestive and inappropriate texts, especially given the circumstances (late at night, in a hotel, alcohol at the social presumably). If the roles were reversed you'd probably be upset with your bf if he got similar messages from a woman and played it off like no biggie, and you'd have every right to be.


And now you want your boyfriend to be ok with you spending a week in that person's home while you're a plane ride away? Nope.


It's reasonable for a partner to be uncomfortable with their SO spending a week alone with and crashing with someone of the opposite sex, but that can be worked through. It's not reasonable in the slightest to do that with someone who has very clearly shown recent sexual interest in you.

Don't play with fire."
"&gt; They don't pay rent or utilities.

Yeah that's why they haven't left. There's every incentive to stay put until they're forcibly removed. Every month they don't move out is money in their pockets. To get out voluntarily early is just wasting money, in their minds.

They are going to make you the bad guy, so just rip off the bandaid and do it. Inform them they legally have 30 days to get out. Make their lives hell in every legal way for the next 30 days. When they're out I'd inform my husband I never want to see them again."
"Also OP mentioned that he was huffy about going to the party in the first place, so it seems like he just went with the sole intention of causing trouble.

&amp; Why did he get so annoyed about the Grandads Dracula bit, causing OP to have to tell him to 'ignore it'. Pretty odd thing to get angry about, seems as though he just has it out for him"
This is the answer right here. Give HIM a reason to avoid you.
Normally I always want to play devils advocate or go nicer but holy shit please tell him to shut the fuck up. Please. I can imagine the look on his face. What’s next? Is he going to send you to your room? Either he chills or you walk. You don’t deserve shit like this. 
She was. She had made some very veiled accusations when we got engaged too but we brushed those off.
"I would trim Every. Last. One. of the friends, family, whoever out. That mess isn't healthy for you or your kids. She wants to ""ruin"" you, show her the world is too big a place and she doesn't have the ability. 

Shut down any and all ability she has seeing into your life. If she's friends of friends, let her have them. You have a few that stuck with you, make sure you make it clear - you are dropping ALL contact, and if they want to chum up with her at all, they will have to go onto the chopping block too.

You have your children and husband. You have his family? Your kids are in school. You can meet new parents. Network to the EXCLUSION of her. Act like you don't even have a sister. If the topic comes up, own up to the fact that you do, but she's toxic and you had to completely separate yourself from her and mutual friends. YOU get to paint the picture of her before she goes in and starts belittling you."
"Well they can't go anywhere with the kids ever again, either. Unless they split them up, too, so they can guarantee one parent and at least one child will survive if the others perish. Some are better than none, I guess?"
Combined with the silent treatment and cursing at him OP seems like he has bigger issues than a plane ticket. 
"I would say before you plan to be intimate. Just because things might happen and the hair might shift and that might be a bit of an “uh oh” moment if the person isn’t expecting it. 

But honestly, wigs, weaves, and extensions are sooo common now even for people with a full head of hair! The person you’re dating might not even care. Don’t stress it. "
"How come you found it necessary to mention these female friends who didn't want you? Smells of r/niceguys to me. There's probably a reason you're a loser back here in the states where you belong. Those poor locals just cant tell how weird you are and you get treated different because you are white. The problem is you will always be a foreigner there and you will never fit in, just like the states. God forbid you start a family out there, you don't seem lile the kind of guy that should be kickin down life lessons to anyone but a tamagachi."
"Your boyfriend doesn't sound like he'd be into this idea. If you push for this, get ready for the possibility of torpedoing your relationship with him."
"The plan is to hang out with the Toxic family, but you might have inadvertently brought up a great middle ground, find time to meet with SIL as well and see if she can’t shed some light and provide another viewpoint, since she won’t be there for the events with the toxic fam members.  Thank you!"
"I agree, to me it sounds a bit like a yo momma joke. Not a reflection  of the actual person."
"this might sound crazy, but I don't whether there is an inappropriate relationship between them or not is the most important issue. The fact of the matter is that your boyfriend has disrespected you several times. You asked him to lock the door while you have sex and he didn't listen. He repeatedly ditched you for her. He doesn't seem to listen to you when you tell him you're uncomfortable. And to top it all off his sister's comment about bleaching soap is EXTREMELY disrespectful.

While I wouldn't go so far as to accuse him of incest, I would say that you are not overreacting to how disrespectful he has been."
"A hotel, especially one an hour away is going to offend them. I'd tell your girlfriend you've realized you need some down time when you visit so you're going to go to bed earlier or take a nap and really use the time to relax in the room watching TV/mocie, reading, etc. Or you can take a walk or visit the town.  Your girlfriend shouldn't mind and that should give you the alone time to recharge. "
Depends on the route you want to go but I'm leaning towards sending her that concert ticket in the card.
"I second this. As a woman, it can be really disappointing when you're really horny and spend a while rolling around with your partner, anticipating an orgasm, then the sex comes and you don't get to finish. It feels like your partner doesn't care enough to make sure you feel good, too, and can make you feel stupid for even wanting the sex in the first place just to get a few strokes in and then it being over with. She also may be telling you it was fine and she had fun in an attempt not to hurt your feelings, as she knows it was your first time and men base a lot of their masculinity around their penis."
"You don't need your wife to stand up to them. You only need to back off and start making other plans on the weekend. If you're close enough to your in-laws to manage their finances then you're close enough to tell them ""I'm going fishing this weekend, I'm burned out and I need a break"". "
"I think when she said she never moved away from ""home"" she meant the home town. I believe she has her own home. At least, that's how I understood it. "
"That's your prerogative, mate. You keep judging people for things that don't affect you and hurt no one (y) "
Lateness is a nonverbal way of saying that your time is not as important as my time.
"My SO and I have trouble picking something sometimes, cuz we're both like ""I don't care, whatever you want"" over and over again.  We've decided to do something a bit different.  Say we want to see a movie, we pull up the list of the movies that are out, and then we each take turns getting rid of one movie as an option.  Then, you're not necessarily choosing what to do, but instead what not to do.

It works in a really weird way."
"&gt; I see why people could get the wrong idea, but it seems normal.

It's really not. Going to this much effort to get you this present is unusual. I get that you say you would do this with a male friend, but it's really naive for you to act like her being an attractive woman is irrelevant. It's not, and it is a weekend away with her. It's inappropriate. I've had many male friends, and this is unusual."
This is an excellent opportunity for your wife to learn that she is not simply right because she's older and should in fact apologize to your nephew (or at least drop it)...
"Unless she asks for your opinion of the guy, just keep it to yourself.  And I wouldn't bring up the 4/10 specifically, but definitely feel free to call him a scumbag if she ever asks for your two cents."
"Emotionally mature people will see stuff like this coming and only date SOs that are compatible with them in regards to stuff like this, so in healthy relationships the point is moot. Most people recognize that sacrificing central parts of your identity, whatever they may be, is contrary to the point of a relationship. A good relationship should make you feel more like yourself, not less."
"&gt; I don't think he's told his parents yet.

I think his parents need to know and soon. What happens if his parents do the same thing your ex-husband has done? Then will he be hoping you support the both of them? "
He needs to deal. He needs to hire a walker or re-home her. This is cruelty to under-exercise her
"Your boyfriend is so controlling that the IDEA of talking to him about you meeting up with old platonic friends is stressing you out.

Your relationship sounds abusive and toxic.  Any friendship where ""you arent allowed"" friends of the opposite gender is toxic.

What is good about your boyfriend?  Do you LIKE walking on eggshells around him and taking flack he intends for his ex?

"*Ding ding ding*

Still a screwy way to deal with her guilt though. "
"Maybe new mommy can ask for help instead of demanding it and crying offense when she isn't waited on hand and foot.

Is this a cultural thing from where you're from? You are posting all over this thread and every comment is asinine. SIL is wrong on every count here, objectively, and your attempts to defend her are comically absurd."
"The thing is, you do not get to decide that the relationship is repairable unilaterally. If she thinks it isn't, then it definitely isn't. "
"Do not marry this man until this is sorted out.   From what you've written, you are not both on the same page when it comes to his role with your children and the place your late husband's memory will have in your lives.

Couples counseling now."
"I mean, if people want to wait in the rain for a packed out restaurant, that's up to them..."
"Yeah I wouldn’t be surprised if your husband is already paying her something on the side. I’m sure he is needled a lot more by her one on one. Is your husband informed about the bottom line numbers with your finances? Sometimes that is the best way to snap someone back to reality. Also, your MIL is asking for a bit much here. She lives free of charge and pays no utilities and has to hang out with her grandkids twice a week. This is a dream life for a lot of grandma’s; I wouldn’t even look at this as “babysitting” so much as being with your family. She could easily find something part time she really enjoys (perhaps something hobby related) so she is making her own money on the days you don’t need childcare. The fact that she keeps asking for money to watch the kids is a bad omen for this living arrangement. "
"Even the most expensive ceramic toilet is prone to breaking like that. It’s just how ceramic/porcelain  holds up to stress. You get your feet just a tiny bit too far apart and you’re gonna have a bad time when it splits and slices off your asscheek. For real, google squatty potty, enjoy their hilarious commercial and get one. They’re like $20"
"&gt; from prior conversations we have had I know she doesn't approve of strippers or guys who go to see them, so I know prostitution is beyond the pale for her sensibilities. If she knew this, she may very well dump me, and maybe even her friend. 

Look, OP's gf doesn't approve of prostitution. He thinks she would break up with him if he knew. So it is ABSURD that he would keep what very well may be a dealbreaker from her.

Second, many women would not be comfortable dating a man who has slept with one of their friends. Again, potential dealbreaker. 

OP's girlfriend had the right to opt out of relationships that have dealbreakers. She has the right to know what those potential dealbreakers her. OP needs to tell her he's gone to prostitutes. Then he needs to tell her he has slept with her friend.

If those are dealbreakers for his GF, then she has the right to know and right to opt out now."
"Here's the thing.

Emotional abuse is behaviour, sure hormones, fear of miscarriage, pregnancy whatever might set the *context* but she is still *behaving atrociously. The leeway of pregnancy is usually more along the lines of 'its OK that you had a random cry and got a bit impatient sometimes.'

I'd be reconsidering the relationship let alone the second pregnancy to be honest"
I was 26 when I became a step parent to preteens. We get along great because they are good kids and my husband didn't raise disrespectful turds. 
"You are correct to be worried that your boyfriend will resent you for having a baby.  He will also resent the baby.  Frankly, that your best articulated concern is to get married while you still fit in a dress troubles me.  

Having a child doesn’t just change your world; it makes it demonstrably worse, especially if you have not got the mental, physical, and financial means that provide stability.  Even for people have it all going on, the introduction of a new baby is very disruptive.  They do not just fold into your life; you must accommodate them, and their constantly changing needs and natures, for at least the next 18 years.

I’m afraid that your circumstances sound way less than ideal.  Surely you want the best of yourself for your child?  Surely you want to account for and respect the wishes of your boyfriend?  You are young, you have time to get yourself established and settled before making - and forcing your boyfriend to make - such a commitment

Tl;dr don’t have a baby now"
"No, I haven't brought up the fact that she's been to mass before for other occasions. The conversation ended pretty quickly and I wanted some Reddit help before I brought it up again."
"You don't owe him shit.  Feel free to tell him whatever you want to tell him.  Tell him his dick is too small for you if you want, no one would blame you.

But keep in mind, the other girl he's with may not know he's still with you.  So you might want to tell her."
Yeah it honestly seems like Kelly is following the exact advice /r/relationships would give to her if we heard her side of the story.
That last line is perfectly said.
"If you’re afraid your husband literally/physically wont allow you to vaccinate, you should divorce him."
"Your wife asked you to do something and you ignored that, and made the decision like you knew better than her. You are in the wrong here. "
"You know where this leads, right? I respond, then you respond, we create a script, two years from now we go to a movie theatre and there it is, the lines we typed out on this sub being played by Shaileen Woodley and some Hemsworth boy. And we get no credit."
"You aggressively disrespected his marriage. If he respects it and his wife, he’ll be distancing himself from you. "
"You seem disturbed by your partner's changeable moods, but you yourself are saying, ""I want to marry this woman and spend my life with her/I'm prepared to walk away right now."" So really, you can't judge her for being unsure when you sound perfectly happy to go with either extreme.

First up, your fiance is absolutely right that you two are rushing into this *way* too soon. It's one thing to say, ""Yes, you are the person I want to spend my life with,"" and another to rush into marriage. I honestly don't know why you guys felt the need to get married this year. So yes, you're going way too fast, even if you do want to stay together. 

Postpone the wedding, and go to couples counselling. Seeing as the venue and flights have already been booked, maybe have this event as an engagement party, but *not* a legally binding ceremony. 

You might find that in a year or two, you realise that a relationship between the two of you didn't work out after all. Or, you might find that you are right for each other and get married after all. But there is no way postponing the marriage could be detrimental to your relationship. On the other hand, getting married too soon might be.

"My mother died of alzheimers 6 months ago, she was 58 and I am 22, she was diagnosed and put in a home when I was 19. So in a way I am where you will be in a few years. I wish I had some better advice for you so here it goes... Alzheimers in its early stages makes people paranoid and highly emotional and it will only get worse. My best suggestion is to sit down with him and listen to the music he plays, I would play music with my mum when she was in the home and it would make her happy because they can still remember how the music made them feel when they were young. Talk to him about happy times you had together, offer to make him his favourite food, take him for short walks around the park or offer to take him out for icecream. My mother also liked to draw when she could still do it so maybe do some creative things with him like draw or read him his favourite books. As for your mother, offer once a week to go out with her and listen to how she is going, she is losing her loved one too and often times it helps to have someone who understands what she is going through.  

However, first and foremost you need to take care of yourself, I would recommend to move out as I did and continue to go to uni and try to have as normal life as possible. You cannot put your entire life on hold like I did when I was 19, it will only make things worse for you. Of course its important to offer help to your mother and stepfather but do this sparingly so you do not hurt yourself along the way and you have time to grieve. 

Finally, Alzheimers is like watching somebody slowly die while they are still living. Your stepfather will slowly fade away and he will not be the person that you remember or grew up with. You need to understand this because it will lessen the frustration, later on, he does not act like himself because he is not himself, his brain is slowly dying, It's painful to watch and I recommend you seek out a therapist to talk to who specializes in these kinds of situations. I wish I had some better advice for you, but honestly, it is a terrible thing to go through. A silver lining though is once your stepfather is in the latter stages, after the paranoia, he will be at peace and will not be in any pain. 
"
"You'd be surprised.  

I went through a similar scenario when my Father met a new woman, she was horrible to me and let her children abuse me constantly, no matter what I said to my Father he refused to do anything... 

So I went to other avenues at school and friend's parents to report the abuse, it always came back to the new woman and she would convince them I was lying, thankfully my Uncle on my Father's side knew better and got me out of there for a while so I could contact my Mum and organise to move back in with her.

This all started when I was around 13/14, my Father is still with this woman and he has refused to talk to me ever since.  I'm 30 next year."
"Your girlfriend sounds like an asshole with very little respect for you that it's insane. It's not simply 'teasing' you when you've asked her repeatedly to stop, and she pees herself laughing in your face about it. Kick her ass to the curb. "
Have her change planes in la guardia for good measure.
"As others mentioned, bringing a hammer and a sickle to a ""communist party"" sounds more like a gimmick and less like a planned disruption. The amount of alcohol he drank might be a red flag though. But since this was his first time meeting your friends, could it be that he was just super nervous and drank a bit more to be more fun and relaxed but underestimated the amount? And then he tried to be funny and but it escalated, partly thanks to your neighbors?"
"I think you should say something like this to the distant relatives:

“At the time I was 16. He terrorized me my entire life. The only way that I could imagine an end to it was by him dying. I don’t remember you protecting me from him. I wish you had shown the same interest in helping me when I was a child as you are now by trying to force me to forgive this person who caused me so much pain. Why are you so vocal now where before when it was me in trouble you were so silent?”"
"Dude, it's not about you, it's not about the ex, it's about the kids. Full stop.

Just because most children of divorce have parents who don't get along doesn't mean her kids should be kept from being with their parents, to make the new boyfriend feel better.

Side note - where is your daughter in this conversation?

Anyway, if you see this as a long term relationship, you have to take a long term perspective.  A few years from now, you should either be married into the family (and therefore invited) or the whole thing will have crashed and burned in which case mouthing now really matters.

My money is on the second opt-in because despite having a kings, you don't seem to get how priorities change.  If you compete with the kids' needs, you're gonna have a bad time.

If you plaster on a smile, wish them well, and act excited to hear about it, you're the supportive and understanding guy who just might get brought on the team full time."
"She's spending the holiday with her *kids*. Kids who want to spend holidays with both their parents, hence both parents are there.

We do the same. I frankly cannot stand my ex but we keeps things civil for the kids and share important holidays together. Not because I'm dying to spend time with my ex, but because it makes the kids happy. Also, we're grown adults who understand that their feelings come first and we can suck it up for a few hours to have things nice for them. "
"Well look. I have two kids, I dated as a single mother before I got married to ny husband. I always told them I had two kids before the first date, but my daughter has a disability and I didn't bring that up until after a couple of dates, like on the third date. One date had adhd, and he didn't tell me until after the 4th date. I mean, Yeah you want to be upfront, but some information can be a bit to personal to share with someone you're only meeting for the first time. I think if you try to treat the information the same as you would if you were making a new friend, that helps. I wouldn't tell a brand new coworker about my daughters disability the first day I met them, but I would tell I have two kids. I wouldn't keep it but I would probably bring it up in discussion after a few days or something. One date means nothing, as long as you tell them before you are an actual thing there's nothing wrong in my opinion. "
"If a guy I’d only been dating for a few months showed me a reddit post whining about how his feelings were hurt because my family came first, I’d run screaming in the other direction.

"&gt;For example, he wouldn't hug his friends or do videochats **because that's gay.**

Right. Just keep telling yourself that."
"As an emetophobic, I can honestly say that not forcing herself into situations is making her worse. Group therapy is probably also making her worse. Talking about it is probably making her worse. And being alone with her thoughts and constantly going over and over it ad nauseam (pun absolutely intended) is making her worse.

Here's a little story of mine:

A handful of years ago I was at my absolute worst with emet. I lost around 30lbs (and at my norm of 125-130 that's really saying a lot) over the course of a holiday season because working retail during a season when there was a bad illness going around (I never even GOT ill, so all my freaking out was obviously for nothing) was just the best ever. I got to the point where I was only going to work because I had bills to pay, but I called out often due to panic attacks of the worst order. I pretty much stopped eating besides a few bites of something a day to keep me going (and the rest of the food getting thrown out because I'd taste something unpleasant - probably acid from my stomach due to not eating) and taking a vitamin in the morning that probably saved my ass. It was only compounded by going online and seeing people posting about being sick on Facebook, and having reached out to some huge emetophobia website that had forums where people could talk about it. That was probably the absolute worst thing I could do. I went to that site and read posts like crazy when I was home and learned even more about the stomach bug than I knew before (like how long it can actually take to come down with a bug - I only was having panic attacks the same day prior, but then I found out it takes 24 hours or more to actually get rooted and for you to get sick from it... then panic attacks were THREE DAYS STRAIGHT). I had more problems reading about others' issues. I started worrying about more than I had before. I'll continue stressing that the only reason I didn't lose my job is because I had bills that I knew I had to pay or I'd obviously be out on the streets. I certainly called off enough that if I hadn't been in retail at the time, I would've been fired. 

The first issue of order is that she needs to get out into the world. I have a lot of trouble going out and doing things, especially in the winter (I do hole myself up in my house a lot because of it). I don't go around people drinking a lot because of the obvious fear. But I do my absolute best to not let it stop me. I went to two Halloween parties the past two weekends. I go to the arcade. I get out and do things. That's the only thing that can help emet - actually DOING things. You have to basically re-train your mind that while yes, people get sick, you won't necessarily get sick when you're out. Over the past years I've been doing that. I've been taking those jumps, because just going to work and coming home and then freaking out about having been around people isn't good. But I had to do this myself, I had to help myself. I had to come to the realization that what I was doing wasn't good and wasn't helping. That reading those forums about people freaking out about how they've had this feeling or that feeling (that I then started worrying about because oh god I didn't know this could happen) wasn't helping me. 

But that's the underlying thing. She has to help herself. She has to know that she has to help herself. If she can't come to that realization then all your effort is for naught anyway. You can't help someone that can't help themselves. And like people like saying here on this subreddit, you can't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. It's probably best to cut her out."
Also OP needs to knock off the self-pity.
"OP how old are you? It seems either you are quite young (in yours 20s?) or just quite insecure/not as trusting as you should be in a healthy relationship. 

Unless you plan to date a SAHW/SAHM, any woman with a career would have to deal with tricky situations like this in her career. 

Instead of focusing on her well-being (do you know how FUCKING STRESSFUL it is to have unwanted attention from your co-worker? ) and her career, and trying to find a solution to this sitatuion.

Your entire and only focus is your feelings and your jealousy. Your gf is not a property. If you can't trust her or repect her, breaking up with her is doing her a favor. "
"Ok. Let's just assume for a minute that SO is completely truthful despite the suspicious ambiguities. He unilaterally made a serious and permanent decision without your input or your knowing. Extend that transgression to other parts of your life. Kids, finances, anything. Is this someone you want to be with?"
"Ask him why he hasn't defended you to his family for treating you this way. Tell him that unless they change their attitude, being around them socially is uncomfortable to you and you won't do it. If he cares about you and is as ""grounded"" as you say, he will understand. Remember, being that wealthy means you have a different worldview than the rest of us. He may need some serious discussions to actually see your viewpoint."

I would suggest saying the above in an email so that it's on record. From now on, keep record of when he calls you and what is said. Hopefully, he backs off. I would also suggest telling someone else who you trust so you're not carrying this on your shoulders alone."
You should probably drink a lot less. 
"This, especially with the Harvey Weinstein stuff going on and everybody speaking out against sexual assault. I absolutely understand why OP is hurt as hell that they didn't listen to his side of the story and I personally wouldn't really want to hang out with them afterwards either, but I can understand why they were hesitant to question her story if they really thought she could've been assaulted. 

Also, OP, good for your wife and best friend. "
"I see no harm in asking. It's a lovely gesture.

It's common on Dia de los Muertos to put things your deceased loved ones enjoyed on an altar, so you might also consider bringing something a baby would enjoy. A rattle or a pacifier or such."
"Talk to your father.  If it wasn't already specified in the divorce, he may be able file in court to require your mother to cover a certain amount of your sister's collehe costs and/or to require that the 529 plan be spent on your sister.  In some states, college costs may need to be filed before the kid turns 18.   

Tell your father about your concerns.

Also, if I were you, I wouldn't be willing to pay for Sister's college expenses.  "

Never talk to the cheater first.
"I'm glad to see this comment here.  My fiance is like you (more the first part and less the second), and it caused me no END of frustration until we finally sorted out that he honest to god just doesn't have that many strong opinions.  I said something similar to what your boyfriend said, and it helped him to understand where I was coming from.  I've learned to be ok with making more of the decisions, but we have also instated a rule that if he HE suggests going out, or grabbing food, or seeing a movie, etc. he is NOT ALLOWED to say he doesn't care where we go or what we do.  It has helped a lot."
"Right? OP you should mention this to your friends and family so they’re aware. And if he knows your school, work etc, schedule make sure you’re not walking alone.  Also you might stop posting on social media for a while, check ins and mentioning what you’re up to can give him a heads up to where you are/where you frequent-you might ask your friends to not mention you on social media too. This dude had some kind of obsessive disorder"
###Any relationship where one partner chokes the other is abusive. Full stop.
"She is point blank refusing to stop doing something you hate. This is not a ""I hate being tickled and it's ruining my relationship"" this is ""My GF won't stop doing something I hate and it's ruining my relationship"". 

You aren't at fault, and honestly her refusal to stop is a bit creepy. "
it’s almost like....women internalize misogyny and also are capable of contributing to a society that makes women/people hypercritical of themselves? 🤔
"I think it's incredibly unlikely that your mom would actually hurt herself, but I hope you know that if she were to do so it would be exactly ZERO per cent your fault.

She is being abusive. Even if you take out the verbal abuse and the threats, she is trying to control you and stop you going to school. Don't let her ruin the whole path of your life."

I doubt that excluding vegetarians would be reducing your dating pool that much, so I say go for it. Online dating is such a crapshoot anyway, why not focus on people you can share your favorite foods with. "
"Those are crocodile tears. Beating up your children is NEVER ok. Standing there and watching your children being beat up is NEVER OK.

"Are you Kelly?  The mental gymnastics of justifying cutting off people who speak to Alice, then people who speak to the person who speaks to Alice.  Thinking it's all normal no matter how far out you extrapolate this grudge...  This has to be you."
"&gt; Apparently from his POV our relationship was dull, I was boring, we had nothing in common

When my ex and I broke up, *everyone* started coming out of the woodwork and saying, ""you know, I have no idea what you ever saw in him, you were *such* an odd couple, you and (New Boyfriend) are a far better match.""

As I talked to more people, I realised that my friends, who had known my ex and I for years had never warmed up to him, but included him in the group because he was my partner. After the break-up, they kept me and dropped him, by their own free will. I never knew they felt this way until after the break-up. 

It's possible that your boyfriend, either directly or indirectly, turned your friends against you. But it's also possible that they decided on their own that they prefer including your ex in their group than you. 

Though, on the flip side, another group of friends kept my ex and dropped me. We had all had fun together when I was in the couple, then post-break up, my messages got ignored and instead I'd see photos of them all having fun, at my old apartment. 

The friends who value you will keep you in their lives. Time to reach out to the people who still value you."
agreed very much. Please do that
"Still, that's not acceptable at all for him to hold her by her throat against a wall. Also, a dog is not a toy, she loves it like a child and he knows it's important to her. Her comparison to me was pretty fair if it's what she's truly feeling like. 
He's a total scumbag and possibly a sociopath. "
"Years ago I worked in a super chichi area as a make up artist and this woman came in to get her face done for some big gala do later and brought her kid who was about 4 because he wouldn't stay with the nanny.

Poor kid was clearly unwell. Red face, temperature, cranky and just wanted to be cuddled up at home with mum on the sofa and a DVD. He was clingy and upset and my lovely co worker played with him and preoccupied him while I did the woman's make up.

Just as she was leaving we wished her and the kid well and she breezily said 'oh it's only rubella, he'll be fine by the weekend'. My co worker went white and excused herself. Turns out she was 5 weeks pregnant with an IVF baby.

She miscarried a few days later as she came from a country that hadn't vaccinated for rubella and relied on 'herd immunity' to protect her. I left the company a few month later and 15 years on I still want to shake that selfish woman who didn't get her kid vaccinated and brought him out when he was ill. 

And I still wonder if my old co worker ever got to have a baby in the end. Either way her life and her family's life was changed forever that day because someone was anti vax. You and your husband might not even be discussing this subject if other people shared his view because there would be no baby. 

I'm so sorry you are faced with this. Anti Vaxxers are utterly baffling to me in their amazing health privilege."
"If he's gonna be a child, treat him like one. Make a chore wheel. He needs to assume some responsibility. 

That being said, the ignoring you is a while different issue. If you've brought up these concerns to him and he's brushed them off, he clearly doesn't respect your feelings (or just doesn't care), and that either needs to change ASAP or you need to kick his ass to the curb. 

You are not being extra - he's being shitty. "
"If I see one more person call her panic attack a ""tantrum"" I'm gonna flip a table. I'm not saying that OP doesn't need to work on communicating emotions better over the long run, but goddamn she's in crisis. That calls for a bit more leeway/compassion/empathy. "
"Her parents know yes they got in an argument and the police were called. Apparently she left and Is living with him now and some roommates. The legal age is 16 here.

I am planning on checking with the leasing office tomorrow. I really want to avoid getting a third party involved if possible. Good to know about the rules pertaining to staying for longer than a month. Thanks
"So, if you're concerned about counting calories, you need to be really careful about gastric surgeries. Most of them require weighing portions and careful eating to prevent injury.

"Im in the SF bay area rn, paying 3k+ for a one bedroom apartment. There's no way a part time worker, part time student can hack it, unless you want to sardine with a bunch of migrant workers in illegal housing. Your mom isn't saying ""we"" to be controlling or unkind. She just knows that you can't afford to stay without her, so she's providing you another place to live."
"No, they'll just adjust by implementing ""family jogging hour"" so that they can do it all together."
"If she was any younger, my advice would be different. Given that she is almost 18, I would say cover for her. She obviously realized she made a mistake and was smart enough to go to someone she trusted for help. I think if you betray that trust now, she may be more wary about reaching out for help when she is in a sketchy situation. I would cover for her once but if she does it again, alert her parents."
"Yeah, until I got to that line, I was thinking, ""Well, this will need a big talk and some clear boundaries, but I think it's nice to give your parents room to grow, and you can always go back to the way things are now if they aren't able to respect you."" But then after that line, I was like, ""I'm out."""
"Dude, your girlfriend should be handling this. Her family makes this her responsibilty. 

If you want, let your gf know that you will pay her back for your (and maybe her) portion after but, in order to chop this assumption down, she should pay for the meal or manage getting her mom/sisters to pay for their own meal. Alternatively, your girlfriend can let the server know it will be seperate checks. Pay your own and let everyone else do so as well. 

Also, do you guys go out every time? Maybe have them to your place now and then? You could even do it pot-luck style to encourage the idea of everyone contributing. 

Talk to your gf now about her plans for her mom in the future. Does your gf intend to support her mom financially? Is that even possible? Does her mom expect her (and you by extension) to cover finances? Have that future money talk. "
"I agree with the others that that specific speech is more likely to cause conflict than resolve it. However, I think that flipping the script in a gentler way (e.g. explaining that she trusts him not to try have sex with any random woman he sees) and to explain that his tests feel like manipulative traps are good ideas Basically, she should make it clear that he's hurting her feelings and is unfairly projecting his friends' exes wrongdoings onto her, but she shouldn't include insults.

which?"
"My friend will host a BBQ in summer and supply all the food and rent tents and such. It's a huge event. He asks for $20 for food for the weekend, but he's a chef at a fancy restaurant, and I don't really think he makes money off it (it's a lot of food). If he's harvesting you guys fresh oysters (that you trust on quality) then it might be OK - it's like you're contributing to dinner.

I can't see this as being a good idea to raise money. People around where I live pay $20 for random labour jobs. 1 or two days of hard work chopping wood or moving furniture will net you $250, so it's kind of dumb to impose on friends like this for oysters."
Ugh thank ya'll so much for sharing these stories. I struggle with this obsession every damn day even though I haven't acted on any behaviors in months. 
"I think that is also the point - your kid is going to have many outside influences throughout their life. As parents, your job is to raise knowledgable and resilient kids who can survive not being the best looking kid, and knows how to set healthy limits to their eating etc. 

It's OP and his wife's job to make sure their kids are healthy, physically and mentally, until they grow up enough to take responsibility themselves. Trying to avoid good looking people isn't going to help that, in fact it might do the opposite and make the kid feels like she's not good enough to hang out with good looking people."
"If he can afford to go out drinking, he can afford a bicycle to get him to the bus stop.

"This is an easy one: if you don’t wanna, then don’t. This is literally a problem which solves itself.  

I would do *exactly* the same thing in your position.  

It would be different if you missed these people or felt any kind of regret over how things ended, but you obviously don’t. You have a good life, good friends. You’ve moved on. So what have you got to gain from this? The fact that Diane is still part of the family means that any form of reconciliation is simply not realistic. All you’ll be doing is inviting drama....drama you have worked very hard to escape from.  

They didn’t treat you like family when you needed them, so they can’t expect you to treat them like family now that it suits them.  "
"I can't tell if this is sarcastic or not. He's at work, and she's coming in as a customer. It's bad for business to tell your patrons that you need space. Sounds like a comedy sketch."
"Absolutely. There are plenty of stories of affairs happening as people spend more and more time with people other than their spouse. OP's BF was very responsible to nip this in the bud effectively. 

Imagine how much worse she'd feel knowing he likes someone and him going to that place and seeing her often ."
Ambushing is to rid yourself of doubt. She has the evidence already. She should secretly lawyer up to get the best deal out of this so she's not completely fucked. 
"If I were you, I'd be upset about what happened. You had a seriously crappy night. He was pressuring you for sex rudely (where you were supposed to have sex safely in this house full of extremely overly drunk people, I wonder); you were cleaning up his vomit; you dealt with that woman having seizures, which must have been scary; you had not way to get home. There's a lot that happened that must have been truly awful for anyone to deal with, and on top of that, you have some social anxiety."
"&gt; He actually would love that. 

Well, I didnt expect that answer. 

You may want to reconsider your compatability"
"I think the fact that she is asking such _bizarre_ questions means there's every chance she'll look up your file again next time she wants to know if you've got an innie or an outtie belly button or if you've ever broken a bone. She has already crossed a whole lot of social boundaries, and this incident is just the first time (that you know about) that she's crossed a legal boundary. 

You aren't overreacting and she really needs to be disciplined over it. "
"Hang on, how many times do you think your sister deserves to be choked? "
"Feels wrong, but I'm curious what BF thought he was so right about. Pacific or European theater? Atomic bomb? Ohh man, it was probably the bomb.

My grandpa served in the Pacific and would only ever tell funny stories about the war. He refused to talk about anything else. He died a couple years ago and I always wondered what he saw and did. But you have to respect an old veteran's privacy and let them lead these conversations. OP's BF is an emotional child."
It’s not your problem. Why is he contacting you anyway? He should be taking this up with your bf.
"A therapist is not a doctor and is not licensed to prescribe medicine. If you want a script, you must see a psychiatrist."

I try to take the blankets from her sometimes but she's a fighter. She sometimes kicks and slaps in her sleep. Occasionally I'm able to steal back blankets and other times I get beat up lol."
"This is a chance for her to 'be a good partner'. When she's constantly the ill one, you take care of her, there's little she can return. Now you're going to be the one worse off. 

Perhaps see if she can be part of a team, not your exclusive carer. If she's so overwhelmed by her depression, you don't want to only rely on her. But she wants to make an effort and if you're still friendly, maybe that's an okay thing to do. 

Keep low expectations for yourself/the relationship. Focus on recovery. "
"They're not in for anything though, Because I won't let them keep the heat that low. I have told them this, and they don't seem to care."
"
Well yeah she doesn’t need any of that to divorce, but it will help during divorce settlement negotiations. "
"OH MY GAWD, you're right. I don't want my kids anywhere near them. There is no way I'd ever put them through what I went through as a child. It was hell, and unfortunately a hell that looked like a perfectly normal suburban family from the outside. 

Yeah the To-Do lists are ridiculous. It's ""replace the toner in my printer, update my GPS, post pics to my online dating site"". I'm so scared that I'm going to get stuck taking care of him. He's already had health problems once and my sister straight-up **bailed.** It was me that took him to all his follow-up appts, got his meds, etc. 

Thank you for the kind words. Can't tell you how much it means to have people actually BELIEVE me.

/r/raisedbynarcissists is a good place to go for support with your mom
"I'm sorry you harbour such resentment towards your  dad, I hope you can work through it (for your own sake, of course, not your father's.) I do feel as though you're projecting your own issues on to mine, though. 

To answer some of your points, and hopefully move the conversation along:

- When Jane's mother and I were sleeping together, we were always 'safe'. I have reason to believe she tampered with the condoms, but of course that's neither here nor there, now: I'm long past feeling betrayed and Jane is here now regardless. I have since been sterilised. 

- I don't think I've ever 'strung Jane along.' I've never reached out to her, and kept any conversation about her with my ex limited to the financial. I agree that going in and out of a child's life is unacceptable; I was, and still intend to be, consistent in my absence.

-I actually also grew up without a dad. Millions of us did. We didn't all grow up to be child abusers. I find the insinuation that all children of singe mothers are doomed to be messed up quite insulting, actually. So, while I accept that my absence may have impacted her worldview, I'm not willing to take all the blame. 

Anyway, I agree with you that it's not a good idea for us to meet; I have no intention of doing so. What I really need is help constructing a reply which won't hurt her more than necessary. "
"&gt; I agree with you that your moral obligation to the four minor children in your life far outweighs your obligation to a violent criminal who repeatedly abuses children

I agree. Even if this was a daughter you personally raised or had a close relationship with, this is how I would feel. You have an obligation to protect the children in your care. You do not have an obligation to an adult who is a criminal. Her mom knew she'd be doing this without a dad... Whatever you think of OP's decisions at the time, this is how it is now, so going over the past is useless.

OP, just don't respond. Talk her her mother about therapy if you like, and even if you want to help pay for that, you can, but I don't think you're obligated to have a relationship with her when you need to keep other children safe."
"&gt;Jenn isn't a prude by any means, but from prior conversations we have had I know she doesn't approve of strippers or guys who go to see them, so I know prostitution is beyond the pale for her sensibilities. If she knew this, she may very well dump me, and maybe even her friend.

This isn't your choice to make. It's hers. Tell her.

If her ethics say she doesn't want to be with a man and perhaps raise children with a man who approves and participates in prostitution, then you have no right to hide your own past and position on what could very well be a dealbreaker to her."
"You are right, it's not fully black and white. 
You have the part where the new generation continue and condone those racist and male chauvinist traditions. "
"I haven’t tried contacting his family, but I will if he doesn’t come home today. "
"So, the thing is, if we are maximally credible and assume he was *super sure* nothing would actually go wrong, he still doesn't come out looking that great. The obvious intended effect of this ""joke"" is that you have a brief moment of panic as your gut reaction is ""oh no, we didn't save our most recent version"" or ""oh no, we made a mistake"" during the dry run, and then you realize you've been pranked and you fix it and check the whole thing over again and do the real presentation with a slightly elevated heart rate. 

I think the question you should be asking is, what part of deliberately causing you to feel a negative emotion (or several, depending) is *funny* to him, exactly? "
"That's fair. Sexuality is part of who you are and a relationship is a place you want to feel accepted. It might be worth telling her - look I know it was a surprise, and perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier, but being bisexual is part of who I am and it's important that my partner is okay with and accepts that part of me. I need to know if this isn't something you can do (maybe give her some time).

Partly you might be trying to suss out whether she's immature and inexperienced in dealing with this (but could learn and holds no deep problems with it - if you are patient enough to deal with that), or if there's a bigger issue.

I'm also bi, and yes my partner needs to be okay with that. "
"The topic of where I live also came up, and I said which neighborhood in the city. For context, this neighborhood is very close to the college I graduated from, and is filled with mostly students. 

Almost all of the apartments there are managed by slumlords who take advantage of students wanting a convenient location, but I lucked into a nice little place that's well maintained.

Anyway, when I said where I lived, everyone started asking if I had plans to buy a house and move out of the college area. 

I said no, because it's lots of fun living there, I'm going for my masters  degree there, and have a lot of friends around. 

Then I got shit like

""You still like that party lifestyle? I grew out of that before I was done with college""

And 

""I could never live with college kids as neighbors. The last time I drove through there, the streets were filled with trash and broken liquor bottles."" "
You think it’s okay to just do what you want and ignore your wife’s wishes.  You’re wrong in this situation.  It’s not just about the candy.  It’s about you elevating misplaced concern for strangers over regard for your wife.
"Yeah, I would think this is the BIGGEST issue, that OP's boyfriend is completely lacking empathy and understanding about his girlfriend, and basically telling her that how she feels is wrong. "
"This happened to me! My parents never took an interest in me or my siblings' stuff so we never talked to them or each other about them. We just all did our own things and met up at dinner. When I went off to college and was doing all of these club and greek activities she found out from instagram first and was like ""omggg why didn't you tell me that's so cool"" like uhmm because you never bothered to care for the past 18 years? duh. Now I obviously don't tell them anything regardless of their newfound interest. The only know of my brother's ""work life"" because my dad works with him and my sister was different and got over it, but I never cared once they showed they didn't."
"No lady you misunderstand.

Being scared is a healthy reaction in your case because your bf was controlling and seems to have issues.

The fact that you feel scared is the part that is unhealthy.

The way you phrased what you said really sounds like you are blaming yourself for your reaction, when it isn't. 

You're afraid of what might happen. So in other responses you claim he seems to have changed, fair enough maybe he has. So here is your chance to test the waters and see if he really has changed. 

Never forget it is easy to be a nice/kind/caring person when things are going great. A person is truly kind/caring/nice when they are still the same way when things are going poorly.

This is the perfect opportunity to see if you bf really has changed, **or if he just learned to hide his behavior better**"
"And did you talk about them about how they feel and why they feel that way? Did you validate and address their feelings? 

If not, you need to. Your children are lashing out in hurt and your response can't be to just say ""You shouldn't be lashing out"", you need to *also* acknowledge ""I see that you're hurting""."
"You might want to check out the Bojack Horseman episode “Live Fast, Diane Nguyen.” The character Diane goes through almost the exact same thing as your girlfriend.

As to why they do this, there really isn’t a reason. I wouldn’t rule out sexism though. Some moms infinitely prefer their sons to their daughters. "
"yeah definitely don't bring potential intoxication into it unless they explicitly ask you if she seemed drunk/high.

i would reword your message to say ""she was okay, just a little upset"", otherwise it's perfect."

"According to him, this past month was when he deleted the account and ""finally realized"" what he did was wrong. So yeah, pretty recent."
"Well, there you go. She won't accept it and you won't quit... You guys won't work out.

Simple."
"Yeah, that’s what I was thinking as well. "
"Get the test, if you are the father and she wants to keep it there isnt much more you can do but pay child support the next 18 years."
"Yes please talk to a lawyer. Get a divorce. This guy needs a hard dose of reality but more importantly, you need to provide a better life for those kids. You and those kids deserve better. Please don’t make really important life choices based on assumptions. Get informed. Talk to a lawyer."
"My sister's ex was like this. Always correcting her and disapproving of the way she did things. She let it go on for nearly 18 years. First it started with comments. Then it started with physically moving her. Then he started pushing her around. She finally left after he choked her.

Don't give it ""another few months"" to change. That's bullshit. You deserve better. Don't let it go that far. "
"Excellent suggestion. I often find that when I feel too gross and sweaty it can be a barrier to sleeping as well. Just make a quick shower part of your nightly routine, OP."
"Are there naturally thin women who don't have eating disorders? Yes. Is OP one of them? No. She says herself she has a mental block about eating a certain number of calories and restricts eating ""bad foods."" When you combine it with her physical health issues, that's absolutely 100% eating disorder territory. "
Family courts tend to take a dim view of people who deliberately quit proper jobs in order to look poor enough to evade child obligations. 
"They're talking about raping her. As a female.It is deeply disturbing to listen to people indulge in a fantasy about one's violent assault.

"
"You're happy. He's happy. Nobody's being hurt. Who cares about the rest?

I used to share a bed with a friend of the opposite sex when I was about your age occasionally. Lots of cuddling involved and nothing else. Didn't really care if others thought it was odd or that we were dating.

If/when one of you starts dating other people, then it'll very likely be a crossed boundary and you'll have to stop but you're both single so deal with that when/if it happens."
"&gt; I can't blame him for having giant man hands when he is very well a giant man.

but you can blame him for continuing to ""tap"" you when you've asked him multiple times to stop.  if he truly doesn't mean it then he would stop.  ask yourself why he doesn't stop hurting someone he claims to love."
"&gt; He often points men out at the bar when we're out and says things like ""he looks really interesting - I bet he and I would be friends if we talked.""

He points men out that he has never met and comments on their ""personality""? Yeah, nah, he's commenting on their ass. "
"I don't know anything about the military,  but at the very least,  the prisoner would probably be in the backseat or in a holding area in the back of a transport vehicle,  correct? I don't think they'd be sitting next to each other."
"On on side, I am against you because the amount shouldn't matter too much and an honorable guy should not take too much ""pride"" in having a girl ""as close to virginity"" as possible; it just sounds so weird saying it. I can kind of understand this if it was for religious reasons but even then it is a little bit of a stretch to say you took pride in having a girl who has slept with 3 guys.

On the other side, I get you. She lied and that does leave sow seeds of distrust if she wasn't being honest with you over something that shouldn't matter too much. And having a meeting with someone, initially unbeknownst to you, she fucked would be really weird. "
"I see your points, but he can still help out significantly without fully moving him. He can spend mornings/days/evening there to help with feedings (if bottle), diaper changes, watching his baby, take the baby to his place while your daughter is in class, go to doctor's appointments, be supportive emotionally, hopefully providing some show of financial assistance/awareness, etc. and perhaps staying over occasionally on the weekends for a trial period.  Maybe he'll be an awesome dad! But I've seen enough 16 and pregnant/teen mom/life experience to be doubtful about how well this is truly going to be. Most 18 year old boys aren't going to be the responsible daddies you'd hope they'd be. "
"Most Islamic countries use a hose, but no water?  What?"
Awe I love this update. This is awesome!!! So glad for you both!!! :) 
"Yeah that really was not my main point, or even my secondary point. It seems like you're saltier more about that than anything else."
"DO NOT STAY TOGETHER FOR THE KID. THIS IS BAD FOR THE KID.

You know what's absolutely awful for a child? Growing up with depressed parents who hate each other. You know what's actually kind of cool for a kid? Having 2 bedrooms! Also, happy parents. 

"
"I was using my own life and OP stating the child was 12 as an example.  I divorced years ago and my kids are older.  


There is no magic number on dating.  You can wait 2 years and the kids are still going to resent the new guy for replacing dad.  You can wait 10 and they will still resent him for changing the life where they got use to having mom all to themselves.  Divorce is rough.  Its painful and it's something that almost every kid will go through.  You aren't doing them any favors by sugar coating it all and Sitting home alone for years.  Part of them healing is them seeing you heal.  They need to see you happy and healthy and making new friendships and relationships.  They need to know that life does go on after divorce. That you aren't sitting home ""sad""  Otherwise they may not get over it either because you still look sad and lonely.  

 Its also a matter of respect.  After awhile kids should understand that they come first in your life but they aren't the only thing in your life.  Before anybody down votes that keep in mind you probably do the exact same thing with a date night or mom's night out.  You work hard on relationships you want to last because someday the kids will be grown and then it will be just you and your friends/SO.  

Just because you divorce doesn't mean its now wrong to put yourself first.   They need to respect you as an adult and a human being.  It sounds like jake never taught his kids that part.  Which is why every relationship he has is going to fail.  His ex never moved on with a life of her own and he never taught the kids to respect him or his girlfriend.    So they are stuck not being able to heal because they don't have an example on how to.  Mom is still bitter and sad and they know it. and they don't have to care about dad's feelings because he's still convinced with a little more time and effort they will magically get it. 
  How different would it be if mom actually worked on herself and got to a place where she was happy with no more negativity and dad just said ""listen.  I like OP.   She makes me happy and you will treat her with respect just like she does you."" 

  I disagree that they can't understand adult relationships.  Obviously they won't always understand the more complicated parts that you wouldn't tell them about.     But even a seven year old can understand that mom/dad likes to go out and do things with friends sometimes.   By 12 and 13 they definitely understand the world doesn't revolve around them and only them.  They understand the concept of friendships and boyfriends and having a life.  They are usually about to start that life for themselves.  The sooner they recognize you as your own person the better off you all will be.  
I'm not saying sign the papers and hit the town I'm just saying kids are smarter and tougher than we give them credit for.  I think 70% of problems/pain from divorce come from the parents not moving on or not handling it the right way.  


"
So sex work is fine. And *consensual* non-monogamy is fine. This? This is not fine.
"Agreed. I recently logicked for myself that I cannot have a crush on someone that I do not know. I do not know them, how can I have feelings for them?

It is like you say, I want to be in a relationship and I have grown attached to the idea of being in one, NOT the actual crushee. They just represent something. "
"My guess as to the pressure: she was ok with moving in together without marriage, BUT she only wants to have moved in with the person she ultimately married. Now you are out of school and working, but not ready to get engaged, she's worried something will happen and she won't have ""only moved in with her future husband"" if you guys break up. "
"Why does this make you so angry? 

You can hang out with your siblings new baby without being its babysitter. 

I just got a new cat and invited my friends over to see her, I didn't ask them to scoop her litter box while they were here. "
"I don’t think the SIL is “appalling” for asking OP to help change a diaper. She had a right to ask and OP also had a right to decline.  

What *is* appalling is sulking about it, continuing to hold a grudge over a petty issue and emotionally blackmailing OP’s brother to force him to boycott OP’s graduation party.  "
"Yeah my thought was that it was a cheap/ugly looking wire rack next to a nice closed shoe cupboard. Design and aesthetics of a home are pretty important to some people, especially if the others have lived there a while and have the place decorated well. "
"Believe me, it doesn't always 'sucks you in'. After being a live in nanny for almost a year I do see kids as a little smarter than I thought, but also 1000x more annoying.

Some people just don't like kids as much. I feel the same as OP, kid or adult, it's equally sad when they suffer. "
"And two of them sharing no less, disbarring some regency period hers and hers bullshit."
"The sooner the better, the lad could legitimately be in trouble."
"Yeah, I don't think sitting on someone's lap is quite the scandal described in some of these comments. But the thing is, when you're loosey-goosey about asking permission/learning people's boundaries, you can't also be offended when people inform you of the boundaries you're breaking.

It's like the old ""ask vs. offer"" debate. Some people think it's ok to ask for favors, as long as you accept ""no"" as an answer. Some people think you shouldn't ask for certain favors (like crashing at someone's house), they should only be offered, so you don't make the other person feel obligated. Both approaches are fine in theory, but you can't be an ask-person who gets upset when they hear ""no."" Then you're just a brat.

OP's bf's friend sounds like a brat."
"I like to do a simple exercise when faced with a decision on whether or not I should tell someone something; If I were in the other person's shoes would I want to know? 

If your wife helped a male neighbor with something and he tried to get her to sleep with him after would you want her to be forthright and tell you about it? Or would you prefer she keep it to herself?

Personally I would absolutely want my partner to tell me so I could stop thinking this person who would sleep with them behind my back was a friend. Your wife probably deserves better than continuing to interact with someone who would have no problem betraying her in that way. "
"I had a similar situation with my now husband, though I was the asshole who changed their mind (after the wedding). You can read my post history for a more detailed account of our story that I posted on r/childfree. 

It was hard, but long story short, my husband has actually done an about-face on his desire for children. I encouraged him to put some research into finding out what it was really like to have children, and all the sacrifice and difficulties that come with it. We were open with each other, and accepted that we would need to break up if this issue was not resolved. 

Like a lot of people, he hadn’t put much thought into the logistics that come with having children and always thought it was just “something you did”. I used to feel this way too. After about 18 months of communication, plenty of arguments, and research, he has made the decision for himself that having kids is not right for him (not us, HIM. That is essential). He is a professional artist, and he came to the conclusion that his dedication to his art would be compromised. That was what finally convinced him. 

Even though the decision has been made. We still talk about it A LOT, and check in with each other frequently about how we feel. I have been open about the fact that if he decides that this is not the right path for him, we can divorce and wish each other well on our separate journeys. 

I guess this is all to say that it is possible for you and your fiancé to stay together if that is what you truly want. If he is committed and open to seeing your side of things (not agreeing to it, but at least valuing your point of view), it might need to start by opening him up to some first-hand accounts from people who chose not to have children. You could even say, like I did once to my husband many years ago, “I love you and I want to be with you forever. If you feel the same way, you will do me the favor of reading this book: shallow, selfish, and self-absorbed. When you are done, we should revisit how we feel about having children and decide on next steps”. 

I know my case is not typical, and I am an incredibly fortunate women to have my husband, but change is possible. "
"Just get off your freaking phone and live in reality, dude."
"Saying she'd never date anyone of x race, even if she were attracted to them, is pretty cut and dry racist.
"
"So, I'm not a mental health professional of any kind, and if what I say starts to make you feel panicky and anxious, then stop reading. But I think part of what you need to do is *embrace* the reality of death.

Your husband will die someday. So will you. It is likely that one of you will die before the other, and there's a good chance that he will go first. So, knowing that, what do you do?

Practicalities first - do you have wills and powers of attorney? Do you both know what you would like to be done with your remains? Are you squared away on insurance? Losing each other will suck, but it will suck less if you at least have a plan and the reassurance that nothing major has been overlooked. Taking control of that eventuality now may bring you solace.

Second, the fun stuff - what are the experiences that you want to have with him? Travel, kids, house? Make plans to put those things in reach! Even if it's 5-10 years from now, knowing you have a plan and a strategy to make it happen may be a comfort.

Third, remember there are other people in your life. Odds are your husband is going to live for decades - how will you feel if you both make it to 90 with practically no friends you can call your own because you could never bring yourself to spend time with non-husband people? Try to see spending time with other people as positive, instead of just time that you aren't with your husband.

I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope some portion of what I said might be helpful."
"Do you know why he blocked you or are you just guessing that it's because he's mad you left him behind? Because were I in his shoes, I'd have been so embarrassed that I would feel like I couldn't ever face you again. The blocking could just be him trying to put off your next conversation until he comes to grips with how terribly he acted.

&gt;I told my friend and she said to just give him space and then call him but I still feel like a bad person.

Your friend is right - give him space for a few days and then follow up. And **don't** feel like a bad person. He was completely out of line. No reasonable person would expect a girl to stay with and take care of a sloppy drunk who's been groping her against her wishes all night. *He* needs to apologize to *you* because he's the one who behaved like a bad person."
It's all fake.  Just treat it like you would if she was acting in any other TV show.
"Then either go back to plan A, or get help for your social skills and find a nice well paying job. "
"This is your cue to leave, block him and gtfo instantly.

Best case, he threatens empty, but he felt the need to threaten his gf?!

 Worst case he will turn onto you when he had drinks instead of smashing his head in (which would be fine with me, he's an adult and can do whatever he wants with his head). "
"&gt; 12 year old girl is going to accept whatever her mother tells her.

Oh no she’s fully capable of being disgusted about how her mom was tossed over for a shinier penny *on her own*.  Twelve year olds don’t need Mom’s help to figure that out."
"Work &gt; kid's play room.

You said you have 4 rooms. 1 is your bedroom, 1 is for your kid, 1 is your office, and what's the last one for?"
"Okay, the only reason I ask is because this reaction is definitely extreme.

Take a few deep breaths. You can always cancel a plan and go back to the old one, most of the time without hassle. Wait until your husband gets home, and just tell him that while you appreciated what your BiL did, you really don't need such an expensive phone plan."
"Maybe you could show her some episodes of *Supernanny* or *Nanny 911*? Both of those shows are about teaching parents how to set healthy boundaries for their kids. If your mom could recognize that this is what's happening with your niece, maybe she could then apply some of the techniques of the shows herself. "
"We found a random jacket in our house that no one claimed ownership of so I just... took it. It's mine now. I use it regularly. It's become ""my"" jacket lol. For all I know it could have belonged to my father's mistress or something (provided that she exists), but it's mine now because no one claimed it and no one could figure out if it belonged to any of our friends (plus none of our friends ever asked us about a jacket they'd lost). "
"Don't initiate with your abuser. You shouldn't need to.

Do you still have evidence of the abuse? If so, take it to your supervisor and explain the situation and that you'd rather not sit in such close proximity to her. Can you be moved elsewhere in the office? If not, same deal but you won't have evidence to show to back you up. 

If the paper is any good, they will make reasonable accommodations for this. 

IF this paper is any good. You should be prepared for the possibility of losing your job because that's just easier for them, in which case this wasn't your dream job after all because they suck.

&gt; I know I should be over what happened, but I’m not there yet

You'll work through what happened in your own time. There is no timeframe that anyone can impose on you for where you ""should"" be. If you're ever worried that you're stuck, keeping a log of your thoughts and feelings surrounding the incident and how often it comes up can help you determine if they're getting less frequent, staying the same, or getting more frequent. If you are a bit stuck on something, seeing a therapist is a great way to get unstuck."
"If you’re that worried about potential effects of alcohol ruining your life, I highly recommend not drinking until you’ve matured a bit more.

Why so many people are promoting underage drinking here has me completely bamboozled."
"Hear, hear!

OP, I hope you find someone much nicer to you."
"Yes yes! My wedding was pretty stress-free and I'm generally not an angry lady but damned if I didn't wake up the following day and suddenly go nuts over an extremely inconsequential detail. I was angry and sad all day and it felt insanely petty and wasteful of what should have been a really nice post-married time together but I just couldn't get past it. 

You know, until a couple of days later.

The issue is not the photos anymore. It's about how she's handling her negative feelings within a partnership. If OP has been small-scale letting this angry stewing slide in the past it's going to be harder to bring up, but better now than later. Gotta assert those needs, OP."
"&gt; by letting her parents know that she thinks their treatment is shitty

I gotta be honest - there's a very good chance that I blow up the next time we see them. So at a minimum they will be hearing it from me."
"Is the tale of your gf's ""heroics"" going to get back to the friend you saved, or are they part of different groups?   I'd be very tempted to let her just be embarrassed when the real story comes out from someone other than you.  "
"..Yikes. Like someone else said, when you put it together like that It really is obvious OP is the problem, not the husband. Poor guy probably just likes to have his life to himself for once."
"I would have bounced after the first incident.  If you were just being honest and said you were hurt - and he leaped to multiple days of stonewalling and accusing you of being ""controlling"" that's a giant red flag. (now if you were over dramatic and super emotional about a miscommunication about meet up times....that's another story).

From what I'm reading you over-communicate whenever you are upset by something and then he turns that around on you.  This isnt going anywhere good OP.  I suggest not just threatening to break up, and just do it."
"All excellent.  The only thing I'd add to that is to try to model a good attitude towards sex.  

Sex is fun, exciting, intimate, and more than a little silly.  Especially for a first time treat it like it's fun and encourage her through your example to not take it too seriously.  If you treat it as as very intense and like its a huge deal it's much more likely she'll feel intimidated.  The more effortlessly you can mix kindness with passion, intimacy with objectification, and silliness with desire the better...  at least in my opinion.  Tell her what you like.  Tell her when something feels good. Ask her to do something slightly differently and give her heaps of positive feedback when she does.  Be the partner you would want her to be."
Sad he needs to have that explained
"&gt;I told him it’s over and I’m out of this relationship. 

You did right. Now stick to it.

You cant be with someone so volatile and posessive - it's a dangerous mix - literally dangerous. This WILL escalate to physical violence against you in time. A jealous nature never fades, it always intensifies"
"The bottom line is that three is greater than two.

It is still one more person using the bathroom/s, one more person wanting to use the TV in the living room, one more person eating in the dining room, one more person talking, one more person who is allowed to have friends and family over, one more person coming and going.

Thats a lot. Even the best, most considerate person takes up space and is something to negotiate.

This is an 18 year old college student new father. Not likely to be the ideal housemate"
I would burst in tears when my wife replied like this.
"You're completely normal. I suggest you and your wife look into sex therapy, or couple's counseling with a sex-friendly therapist. This is something you can work through. "
"Hey, at 33 I was you, right down to the 6 year relationship and boyfriend with a child and drinking problem, though he was older than me. Around age 33, I really REALLY wanted to get married and have children of our own. I also thought I was too old to start over.

Know what happened? We spent the next decade fighting about....marriage and children. Me wanting both, him coming up with every reason under the sun why they 'couldn't' happen. The relationship turned toxic, because I was trying to force a square peg into a round hole. 

Know what else? He had already did the kid thing. He was over it. Or, actually, he loved kids. But he hated responsibility, commitment and accountability. He hated anything he -had- to do that he had no choice about. Same with marriage. He was great staying with me for 20 years, as long as there were zero repercussions if he walked out tomorrow.

So how does my story end? I'm 46 now. We're finally breaking up, after 20 years. It is the single biggest regret of my life that I did not leave when I was 33, wanted marriage and kids, and he started stalling.

I know it doesn't seem like it now, to you, but 33 is SO YOUNG. I felt the way you do at 33. Like I was 'too old'. I believed all of the 'You need to have all your babies by age 35! If you don't, my missed the boat!"" hype. (for the record, 1 in 5, a full 20% of all babies in the US are currently being born to a woman age 35 or older)

I was also very attached to my partners child. I was in child's life for 20 years. Child got married. Guess what? I wasn't the 'step mother'.  I was Dad's girlfriend. And since they got married, I barely hear from them.

The TL;DR - here? If your boyfriend wanted to marry you, he would have proposed. Don't be like me. Don't try to force a square peg into a round hole. Cut bait and find someone that wants the same things out of life that you do. YOU ARE WORTH THAT.

Best wishes, and good luck."
"It's an irrational fear. We all have them. It's not a big deal to cater to them if there aren't any significant costs. The problem is $1000 or 4 days missed on a couple's vacation are significant costs.

It's been said, but you're both more likely to die on the car trip to the airport than on the airplane itself. Her risk calculation assessment isn't based in reality. That said, telling a person that comes off as glib and condescending.

*I understand you're worried about leaving our children without parents*. *I worry about that sometimes, too*. *You're a great mom and I know you're feeling this way because of how much you love our children*. *The chances that we'll die in a plane crash are lower than the chances of us dying in the taxi on the way to the airport - by a lot*. *This seems like a lot of sacrifice to make to offset a very, very small risk, especially when we're both doing riskier things every day*. *I know you're willing to forgo all the fun activities we had planned, but I was looking forward to them*. *It would take a lot away from our vacation for me and this is the first vacation we've had in almost ten years*. Then ask for her to respond. Don't attack her reasoning. The goal is for her to realize that she's making a detrimental trade-off that just doesn't affect *her* and *her* enjoyment of the trip."
"Some people aren't big talkers. Driving a conversation is a skill, and is admittedly something I have struggled with too.

Have you considered that she does not feel inclined to talk because when she does say some things, you ""lose your damn mind"" and ""call her out""? You also say you don't have friends and find it hard to connect with people. Maybe you are putting out some very negative emotion into the world, and people are reacting negatively to you as a result.

When you snap and call people out or get angry or say drastic things, it makes people withdraw. They want to talk to you less, and they don't want to spend time with you."
"Your wife needs to deal with her feelings on this before it gets out and spreads, otherwise your daughter could become a pariah &amp; have all the other kids parents saying that she can't play with them because of her mum."
"You can reassure her that you love her stomach, but your girlfriend is not an object to play with. Clearly she's uncomfortable with you grabbing, squeezing, and playing with her stomach - stop doing it. This is clearly making her uncomfortable and self conscious. "
"This is just... wow, a broken leg? They can be mended, easily.

The real issue is he made such a huge decision on his own without talking to you about it first. First this, what would be next? If he feels it’s just a decision that needs to be made, will he just make it with no opinion from you? Especially if he doesn’t see the problem with it even now. And the fact that he didn’t even tell you about it and wasn’t going to until you came back. No. No, no, no."
"Op you are penny-wise but dollar poor. 
I really recommend you visit the financial subs.


With that said its both,

"They've been together for all of two months, I think being worried about getting a partner you've been with for so short of period of time is a pretty valid concern. "
"It would have been easier to defend her if she had told you first, so you had time to process and be there for her. Sounds like she felt you would have. I totally get why she feels upset, but her blaming you isn't fair either. It was a big announcement and it sounds like you had no idea it was coming. 

Like someone else said, I would write her a heart felt letter/email letting her know that you are sorry for not standing up for her, that you were also processing the information and your inaction is something you regret. Tell her that you love her, that you are there for her when and if she ever wants to talk.

Then you should leave it alone. Send birthday or holiday cards. All you can do is let her be. Good luck."
"If family are shitty, you cut them off.

"Job hunting while pregnant rarely works out. Nobody wants to hire someone they know is going to immediately disappear for 3 months.  Assuming you do get a job, you’ll need daycare. I have a 2-month old daughter and her daycare costs $20k a year. I need to keep her supplied with milk while I’m gone. I hope you get a job where you can pump your milk at work every 3 hours or so, otherwise you’ll be buying formula which costs about an extra $30/week.  I’m thrilled beyond words to have my daughter, but she is also colicky - aka she cries way more than normal for no discernible reason.  Sometimes I also feel like screaming because it’s so hard to catch a break.  I can’t imagine how much harder that would be while dealing with mental heath issues.  If you end up jobless and also in crisis, that’s a lot of slack for your bf to pick up, especially for a baby he didn’t want. If you plan on helping this baby, I think you should also have a good alternative support system in place because you may very well end up alone.  Having kids is life changing for anyone, but you are looking at so many additional disadvantages I can’t even count.  Your kid is being set up for a very hard road."
"He was begging and borrowing the whole time, and eventually some of his friends back home managed to get money to fly him back here. 

It feels like he isn’t thinking the whole thing through, and got defensive when he told me about his wonderful cultural experience of being desperate for money in a foreign country, and I said that I didn’t want to do it like that. "
"Thank you. I do everything I can to be inside my room while they are home. It's gotten to the point where I've prepared a meal a few hours in advance to avoid going downstairs while they are home. I know that sounds pathetic and I am probably just giving them what they want, but it honestly physically hurts in my chest with anxiety when I go into the common area of my house. 

I think this whole situation is probably compounded by my own mental health problems (anxiety, depression) but regardless I just try to keep to myself. Thank you kind stranger."
"...I missed that he's 34 the first time I read your post and I was already going to comment to say he's an immature brat. 

Then I saw a comment where you mentioned his age again and man. This guy is 34. It's ok to not like something but it's NOT OK to call your SO and your mother dumb and yell at them about it. ""This show is so stupid"" (referring to the show) or ""watching this show is so stupid"" (referring to behaviour) is a lot different from ""you are so stupid"" (referring to YOU). 

I personally think that the Ks is a dumb show and that the people in it are either dumb or really great at acting dumb (for the $$$) but unless my SO is unhealthily obsessed with the show / trying to emulate their behaviour / putting them on a pedestal.. it's just. a. show. No way does it give him any right to throw a tantrum like a toddler. 

He didn't apologise. 

He doesn't respect you, he doesn't respect his mother, it sounds like he's going to treat you the way his mother is treated by her husband. Not. Worth. It. 

Bye boy. "
I can see how that would be the prevailing opinion here. I was worried I was overreacting/reading into things too much with him since my last relationship was emotionally abusive and manipulative. I tend to doubt my gut now. Thank you. 
"""Let's brainstorm some things you and [kid] are both interested in so we can set up some time for you guys to bond over that."""
"Figure out why you didn't feel like you could stand up to your fiancee and simply say no to inviting this guy to your wedding.  

Were you afraid she might call off the wedding if you had spoken your mind, like you should have?  To me the real problem is there is something wrong with how you and your fiancee are communicating.

To be honest, it seems to me you are feeling she has more options than you have, that you are more invested in this relationship than she is.  If you gave her an ultimatum to cut off contact with this guy, I wonder if she would choose to call off the engagement instead.  This does not seem a good foundation for a lasting marriage unless you two can work something out much better than the current situation.
"
"I think this is spot-on. It was very much the dynamic in my family growing up - Mom was the real grown up and Dad was the fuck-up fun parent. I loved the both, but I definitely didn't go to my mom for ""fun"" when I was a teen because she was 98% likely to say no because she was TIRED. 

OP, listen to this. You gotta reach out to your wife and balance the workload better so that she's not too tired to know her own children! I've never met ANYBODY that doesn't like Uno, so she probably would have been down for it if she hadn't been knee-deep in chores the entire day outside the movie (I'm guessing). "
"from a financial perspective, you are SO right.  i am not saying she needs to work her fingers to the bone but having a solid steady resume and showing personal growth in her career is a great way to ensure that OP will have a support network should anything happen to her marriage OR HER HUSBAND.  what if he suddenly has an accident or suffers a health issue and can no longer bring in the same amount of income or any at all?  (yes i know there's disability but it hardly covers much especially if they decide to have kids)

OP, i think you should consider putting more stock into your career because if anything were to happen to your husband, i think you would want to make sure you can still support him right?  

Furthermore, building up that savings nest egg will allow you both to retire earlier.  I love my husband and I don't want him working until he's 65.  That's partially why i work and focus on my career so that we can BOTH retire early and have wonderful golden years.  

Like u/goonbevil says your friends shouldn't be making snide comments but they do have a point.  "
"I didn't plan on it. I just don't know if there's anything to be gained from it. They'll be going back to Europe in a week or so so I don't think she really needs to know, because what can really be done about it at that stage? She'll just be even more creeped out than me with no recourse."
"Based on your post and comments, I think you need to decide about more than just your wedding.

Your comments also tell me that I'm right about her friendship:  if you exclude her, you'll lose her as a close friend.  There's no way to leave her out of the wedding party without sending a ""I'm afraid you'll embarrass me and ruin the wedding"" message, even inadvertently,  and that's the sort of thing that ends friendships.

"
Good to hear that you are finding your passion again. 
"&gt; but didnt speak up for whatever reason.

She allowed a cheater to continue on. She didn't out him.

People who are against cheating don't enable cheaters. 

She could have leveled with OP (e.g., ""Hey, I actually dated him before and I found out he has a longterm girlfriend"") instead of being evasive and angry at OP for having the integrity to do what she didn't."
"&gt;I think he’s just a socially awkward guy who maybe hasn’t had a lot of experience with women. 

That line just made me ugh.  ""Nerdy/geeky"" guys get a pass on being creeps because ""they dont have much experience with women"" when in reality if someone called them out on their shit they'd actually learn it's not OK or that maybe women are people too, not aliens. Sorry if that came off as harsh but I have an engineering degree and heard that line way too often and that I should just laugh it off."
"I agree with you, that it seems pretty condescending and hurtful to go out and pretend to be homeless. He's kind of treating it like the homeless are his very own adventure playground? Or that he expects them to teach him some grand meaning about life? They're just there trying to get by... they don't need someone hanging around trying to find a higher purpose like he's on a weird reverse Contiki Tour. 

There are better ways he can serve people without being condescending and treating them like animals at a zoo. A big part of working with people less fortunate than you is recognising and responding to your own privilege, reflecting on the lens that it puts on your view of the world and working to negate it. 

You don't do that by playing dress ups, you do it through introspection. It sounds like he's looking outward for inspiration and enlightenment (or whatever), when he should be looking in. "
"Honey...welcome to the ""she's lying"" phase.  Just demand doctor intervention and treatment and don't take anything she is saying personally or as the truth.  Oh, and prioritize the baby's safety and do some self care.  

This is going to be a long bumpy ride...not a quick trip."
"Holy shit.  From yesterday's post:  
  
&gt; I extended my stay until Sunday even though I could've left on Friday. I stayed because Steph was staying and she thought it would be nice if we could take a trip to another city before we left. I have a tired wife and a baby at home. I do not know why I would think this was okay and when my wife asked me about the dates of my travel, I did not tell her why I was staying later.  
  
So, this cheating was all very pre-meditated by OP.  What scum, I hope his wife divorces him."

This guy shouldn't even be in the running for possible boyfriend. He's A BAD PERSON. why would you want to be in a relationship with a shit bag?
"Look at it this way - he identified what he recognized as a potential threat to his relationship with you.  He choose to act to protect the relationship.

Everyone gets crushes or attractions to other people. It's normal as we humans are wired to be social.  The important difference between good and bad behavior is how we choose to react to those attractions. It sounds like he chose very well to be good and faithful and to defend and protect his relationship.

He choose you."
"Seriously OP lol you're acting like it's not even related?! 

""Gee yeah I was looking at a woman's profile daily after my partner expressed reasonable discomfort over it, I didn't even do anything what's her problem?!""

Neither of you are acting like adults. "
"But she doesn't have an old car, she has a car that's so beat up it sounds unsafe the way *she* describes it. Commenting on it was perhaps a bit unnecessary, but it clearly wasn't intentionally malicious or classist. I might say something similar off the cuff at a party if my friend had a car smashed on both the front and back end!"
"Same - my boyfriend has a REALLY terrible memory, so when we first started dating he kept a note of important things I'd tell him, like what food/candy I prefer, the names of some of the more important people in my life, etc. He doesn't now that it's been almost a year, but at two months it was cute and not weird.

This? Whoa. WHOA."
"I met with a therapist for about 2 months but it was getting too expensive so I stopped. So I don't know if that counts.. probably not. I learned to just ""deal with it"" I guess? But apparently I carried over some weird baggage.

I guess I could just give him a very vague rundown of what happened, without even the gang part. Just ""abusive ex-BF"". But I was also kind of taught (culturally, and family) to not discuss ex's or past loves, etc. It's just hard to decide what I really want."

So...that edit. Have you seen a therapist/are you seeing one now? Because relapses are a serious concern and your mom's fears are very real.
People always underestimate the amount of time it takes to see results from a change in their behavior or habits.
"This is the first thing I thought of, too.  I wonder how the bf ""got"" the money that he needed in order to come home.  Did he have a job for all of 1 month, or was he begging and ""borrowing"" the whole time?  

I think OP's travel compromise of backpacking is wonderful, and would provide almost the same travel experience that the BF seems to want, without undue stress.  Sad that the bf not only can't see that, but actually turned it into a big issue. "
You're dating a teenage who's been raped by past boyfriends and was  not ready to have sex with you.  Tread carefully and ask yourself what you're really doing here.  When you date someone a) much younger than you and b) in such a vulnerable position you really need to put their needs before your own.
"i second an anonymous e-mail. lots of people here are suggesting involving more real life people - don't do that!! that's extra mortifying, knowing people have stood around discussing her.

let her know in a way that at least gives her some illusion only one person has noticed."
"First off, I’m sorry for your loss. That sucks. 

You’re right, it’s time to go no contact with both of them. There is a reason your grandpa didn’t leave them anything, it would actually be a dishonor to your grandpa to give them anything since he didn’t want them to receive anything. You are simply honoring his wishes. "

"You dated an older man when you were still a minor, and it didn't ""end well""????? Jesus, I just got chills.

You have a history of inappropriate relationships with older men who were comfortable dating, god forbid having a sexual relationship, with a literal child. Children who are taken advantage of like this often find themselves groomed into being attracted to older people later in life. "
Can't you get an emergency order of protection to keep this lunatic out of the house for safety reasons?
"&gt; I don't think he's told his parents yet.

"It's already taken over his life and it has conquered your relationship. Forget cutting your hair--cut him out of your life. Fetishes are fine, but they shouldn't be indulged at the cost of the other partner. In this case, you're receiving zero sexual satisfaction and can't even feel comfortable around him because you know he's about to...fuck your hair? How weird.

He cried over it. You're not going to fix this. Cut him out."
"Perhaps I'm unforgiving but for me I'm not sure how I'd come back from this.

"I was with your fiancé until the end there. I certainly would not pay to build a house on land I didn't own. But his reaction to the situation is completely ridiculous. Let him go, you're better off without him "
Your fiancé made the active decision to hire a prostitute. You say you understand this but your entire post tries to make it seem like his friend is the problem. He's not.
"You say you have a crush on him, yet you sound utterly unnerved by him at the same time. Hell, you've crossposted this in numerous subs. Are you hoping someone will say this is perfectly normal and lovely? Your intuition is screaming at you, telling you this is fucked up. Listen to it. "
"&gt;but you did make a post here, so I think maybe you do care at least a little."
"I think it's pretty typical for serious SOs to spend major holidays together.  It's entirely one thing to ask permission to go somewhere else, but it's not unreasonable for you to have had the discussion about holiday plans before you accepted somewhere else.  Thanksgiving in the states is a big deal and it's a huge family time.  She's likely sensitive that you didn't bother to find out her plans before making your own, even if those plans were taking her with you to your friend's house.  

I would just tell her you didn't really think it through, but that you have now made a commitment and you don't feel right bailing on your friend.  

Question, can you spend a little time with her family and the rest with your friend?"
Is it normal to cheat 15 times in your culture?
"&gt; I don’t want to leave him, I’m lonely and I’m shy and I don’t spend time with anybody else.

You're lonely now, aren't you? You're not spending any meaningful time with your ""boyfriend"" now, are you? When you think about it, what are you really getting out of this relationship? It doesn't sound like there's any real companionship whatsoever, and certainly no romance.

You deserve to be with somebody who wants to be with you. It takes two to tango. It is *not* your job to convince your boyfriend to put effort into treating you like his girlfriend.

Ending a relationship is more often than not difficult, even when the relationship isn't healthy or happy to begin with, but I hope you'll consider this: if you convince yourself that this is the best there is and that you don't deserve more, you are resigning yourself to the loneliness and constant disappointment you are experiencing now."
"It doesn't matter what your families think. It's not their body, it's hers."
"This is great advice. I come from a whole family of people who struggle with punctuality, and this strategy has been really great when being on time is really important to one of us (though in our case, there's a lot of shared blame--my mom is pretty good at leaving the house on time but the rest of us are pretty inconsistent so it isn't always one person's fault). But, for example, if my brother and I are going somewhere together and I really want to be on time, instead of saying ""let's leave at 6:15,"" I say ""I will be pulling out of the driveway at 6:15, it would be great if you were in the car with me."" There have been times when I, or my brother, or my dad have actually been left behind, but generally framing it this way has helped us be more punctual.

That said, if things don't improve I don't think it would be unreasonable for this to be a deal breaker. OP's gf's issue sounds like it's way more extreme than anyone in my family. But just putting your foot down and leaving without her is a good strategy to try before resorting to breaking up right away. "
Came to give advice but got useful advice instead... 
"""I'm sorry your own life is so boring you can't keep your nose out of mine."""
"This is good advice, and I'd emphasize that you should make sure Sarah will listen if you are going to tell her these things. If she's blinded by love or controlled by the abusive relationship then it's going to fall on deaf ears and ruin your friendship without accomplishing anything. 

Pick your moment, come with all the receipts when you do, and like /u/arcxiii said don't go with kid gloves when you do it.

Good luck OP, this is a horrible situation to be in."

"Invited to a PROPOSAL?!?  Let me guess, you'all also be expected to fly to a bachelor party and then fly to the actual wedding?  This shit is getting absurd.  

Even if it wasn't Christmas weekend with the girlfriend, you should skip the proposal.  "
"Diagnoses can range from one professional's opinion based on limited data, to something at requires immediate and critical treatment.  I believe that there are millions of us walking around without a diagnosis that could be considered autistic, or maybe borderline autistic, or maybe autistic by one professional, but not by another.

So I'd like to suggest 2 things that seem juxtaposed, but in any case, first, don't tell people about the diagnosis.  The diagnosis should have been intended to help you and not to label you as being someone who's different.  When you're involved in a serious relationship you can mention to your partner that a you have autistic tendencies - but don't adopt the ""autistic"" label as who you are.

And the 2nd thing is to work on improving yourself.  Read a lot of what autistic people have written, including ""self help"" articles about autism.  If you can see a therapist, ask him or her to help you deal with your issues - including dealing with both the autism label, and any impact that your tendencies toward autism might have.

tl;dr - Reject the label, but embrace the challenge."
"Yes I'm serious.

If you're worried she's going to bang her ex on the table next to the cranberry stuffing while the whole clan looks on... Just do both of you a favor and walk away now.  

She's going to be meeting her ex for the next 13 years.  And if you give a damn about the mental health of her kids, you will hope for their sake that these interactions are as amicable as possible.

You're posting about it, so I'm guessing you feel some combination of:
- jealous  
- insulted  
- hurt  
- rejected  
- unimportant

That's ok, but really, don't wallow in it if you want this relationship to last.  Wish them well, spend time with your daughter, and in a year or two things may be totally different so don't sweat it."
I think any person would want to know if their partner has slept with their friend.

"Jesus, this post is giving me flashbacks. My ex used to take my travel mugs with him every morning after me repeatedly asking him not to and him apologizing then suddenly blowing up and accusing me of overreacting. He also broke/lost the lids to 90% of them and never replaced them. As it turns out he was just a total asshole who didn’t respect my things, and that was a major theme throughout the relationship. 


Your girlfriend is disrespecting you by continuing to take your drinks and she’s 100% wrong. Is this the only thing she can’t respect? I think you need to have a more serious, calm conversation with her to find out how she *actually* views this situation, because if she meant what she said in the heat of the moment then you have way bigger problems. Actually, if she does anything other than listen and sincerely apologize then you should absolutely be reconsidering the relationship. This isn’t really about the drinks. "
"I think it's quite possible he thinks she's pretty and was down for a relationship, but now that he's thinking about marriage and long-term commitment he's realizing he's not prepared to commit 100 percent to her because of the weight and possible health effects down the road. Attraction is fickle, and those thoughts could be affecting his sex drive."

"Oh hello, I know this one well. My mum is a narcissist and so is my dad and my brother is the golden child who has all their lovely narc tendencies now. I am the Scapegoat who is responsible for all the ills of the world.

When I went full no contact after some therapy my mum really ramped up the smear campaign. It was already there in the small comments planting seeds about my 'ungratefulness' and 'how difficult I always was' etc so she just stepped it right up that her disabled daughter who she'd always done sooooooo much for had cut her out and she's an old lady and wahhhh wahhhh wahhhh!

She'd groomed everyone to believe I am the problem not her and all she needed to do was manipulate that to look like the 'winner' she thinks she is. And I knew I couldn't fight fire with fire so as the scapegoat who actually understands human beings and empathy and all that jazz, I ignored her completely. No contact, no rise, no response, no setting the record straight. When 'flying monkeys' contacted me trying to meddle I'd simply reply 'thanks for letting me know' and nothing else. No defending or justifying.

I just got on with being a nice person who doesn't do drama and gossip and counted on the fact that narcissists always out stay their welcomes. I lived my life and gave her rope to hang herself and after a few months, people started seeing the stories didn't add up and distancing themselves and distrusting her sob stories. Only the hardcore flying monkeys stayed and showed their hand to me so I know who to avoid.

It's joyous. I'm left alone and my mother has shot herself in the foot while I have a lovely peaceful life. I totally recommed Rokelle Lerner's book if you suspect both parents have narc tendencies as she's one of the few people to note that covert and overt narcs often get together and create merry hell.

I also totally recommend Shannon Thomas's book (available on Amazon Kindle) and her website on this. But TL/DR: don't engage. Let your sister blow herself out and see who is left standing in your life after Hurricane Golden Child has been to town."
"All he is “providing” is money, so she can take care of THEIR child, THEIR house, THEIR everything and he can complain and harass her. He is “unhelpful” because all he is doing is throwing money at her to fix the problems/their “marriage” and then complaining that she’s doing it. Truthfully he treats you like a maid, but worse because maids get paid."
The police told me to say something like “do not contact me. Any further contact will be considered harassment and will be reported to the police.”

And if he lives that close, it makes OP so *convenient* as a side-piece. And the ""official"" address is far enough away that she wont expect to visit HIM."
"Based on everyone's responses, I can see I perceived the situation much differently than most people would have. As I mentioned, she's like a sister to me, and that's why I did not thunk twice about it. When I get home, I am going to apologize to my fiance for making him feel uncomfortable and then we'll have an open and honest conversation about boundaries, as I would never want to intentionally hurt him or disrespect him. Thank you for your point of view and helping me see the other side of things. I appreciate that I have a place to get other people's opinions and better myself because of it. "

"Yeah, I feel you...

&gt;Should I ask Kyle to explain why he does this? Could there be a reasonable explanation I'm not thinking of? Or is he secretly like, not to be dramatic but some kind of obsessive stalker?

I am leaning towards him being mentally unwell. I am not sure I would even care about an explanation at this point. It's the inclusion of various speculations that does it for me. He's not just trying to remember things, he's analyzing because he's suspicious. I am not sure it's even worth asking him about, it's only been 2 months and such a detailed log takes *effort*...I would definitely worry about things getting nasty if she asked about it and I certainly worry what would happen if they remained together for longer than this. I could see this turning into something abusive pretty fast..."

"If your gaming habit is compulsive, or it's interfering with other aspects of your life and things you want to achieve, then yeah, it's time to speak to a therapist. 

It sounds like if you could have changed on your own you would have by now. You're stuck in habits that you, quite rightly, recognize will make it difficult to build and sustain a lasting relationship.

"Yep, tons of red flags here. I wouldn't jump so quick to the incest accusation, but they have a very unhealthy relationship and you are perfectly within your rights to call him out on it.

"If they're poly and like to hook up with people around town - aka they're living openly as if they're single - it would make sense they wouldn't want anyone to know.

"&gt; I hate it when people refer to this as easy going. 

That's because it's not easy going.  In fact they are extremely dead set on *not* being the person that plans anything, which is in fact pretty inflexible.  It's like if I said I was extremely easy going about cleaning because I don't really care how my maid does it for me.

"&gt; I'm confused why everyone is acting like she either got pregnant on purpose or didn't use her birth control

1. If you use birth control and condoms, this shouldn't happen. Low probability. 

2. They're young. They're not fully developed individuals, and they're more likely to be irresponsible about this. Yeah, maybe she took the Birth Control, but she doesn't seem to mind that it failed, as she isn't following through with other options. 

3. At least OP's daughter is adamant about keeping the baby. In an age where she had birth control and has a choice to terminate, she's decided to keep the baby, knowing it will make her life more difficult, and seemingly not caring about what it's doing to others in her life. 

4. In terms of math, OP's daughter is 15 weeks pregnant, and she told OP a month ago, meaning OP was notified at the end of the first trimester. After 2-4 weeks, OP's daughter should've known she was pregnant (taken a test, missed a period, sickness, etc...), so it looks like she sat on the info until she was almost past the point of no return. 

I think more people (me, at least) are upset that OP's daughter is intentionally taking the hard route for herself and others here. Mistakes happen, but she has options and is choosing to ignore them. "
"You ""took pride"" in her low number of partners? That is weird and gross. The number of people she has slept with is definitely not a reflection of you, it's strange that you think it is. How many people have you slept with? "
"It was wild. My mouth dropped open when I got her enormously long text claiming that I said ""it was no big deal"" and never said she needed to be ready when I got there lol.

I sincerely hope she grows from this. I did/said/thought some stupid stuff when I was 22 so I have faith that it's not too late for her to get it together. "

"No one can force you to feel an obligation that you don't, I suppose, but I think it shows a remarkable lack of caring for Jenn's feelings that you think she might be uncomfortable with this fact about your past, and you're deliberately concealing it from her.

"Well, then technically, neither do you."
"Kids have no foresight, and therefore at his age it's not uncommon to not be able to predict hypothetical emotional responses. It's already hard to do for adults in most hypotheticals- at the base most adults would feels sad if their parent died (assuming it was an okish relationship), but might not know at all how they'll actually react. 

Sounds like reading a bit about child psychology might help more in this situation, and perhaps seeking some professional advice or the advice of another caregiver that spends extended periods with your son (ie his teacher, sitter, aunt/uncle, etc.)"
"When I was 10, my dog died. My parents cried, my brother cried, but I didn't. I cried 3 days later after everyone else had gotten over it. In fact, I cried for weeks, and my dog's favourite stuffed monkey around in my backpack for a year. Obviously I was sad the whole time, but I held it together. Partially because of the shock and not understanding the gravity of it, but there was also the survival instinct. Everyone else was crying, and someone had to comfort them, so I did. Your son might be trying to be strong for you.

Don't force him to be upset. He's 8. He isn't exactly emotionally intelligent yet. Let him process it. If he's still not sad in a couple months, question it. But there's really no need to worry about it. So what if he's not sad. It's not like he's happy about it."
"So first of all, it's up to you whether you are comfortable ejaculating inside of her, and if you aren't, and you tell her that clearly, she needs to respect it.  If it turns her on to ask you to cum inside, fine, but she needs to know that you aren't going to.  And her asking you can actually take you out of the moment and make things awkward for you.

That said, let's talk a little math because I think you've got your probabilities wrong.. and some of your data too.  A progestone IUD like Mirena has a 0.2% failure rate.  That means, out of sexually active women using only Mirena as birth control for a year, 0.2% of them will get pregnant.  That failure rate already takes into account that people don't have sex only one time per year.  And frankly, very frequent sex could actually reduce the rate, because it could lower your sperm count.  You seem to think it's a 1% chance per act of sex which is both the wrong number and the wrong interpretation of it.

Even if your girlfriend is twice as likely to conceive as a typical user of Mirena, it would still take an average of 125 years for her to get pregnant.  

Adding withdrawal to Mirena can't hurt, but how much it helps is unclear.  If the failures of each method are independent from each other (and it's not clear they would be) then you might be reducing the likelihood of pregnancy in a year from about 0.2% (1 in 500) to about 0.04% (1 in 2500).  "
Look up the Scapegoat/Golden Child dynamic and you'll see how it's possible. Especially if your boyfriend was the youngest. 
"I dont even necessarily have the “want” to drink. Im just starting to find my friends wanting me to get out more cuz im a like able guy, im just shy and kinda anxious tbh. "
"This was so wonderfully written and thought out - even though I don’t necessarily need this advice I found myself thinking “hey I could do more of these things!” 

You’re really great for writing this up and being so kind and eloquent. 

Thank you, truly, for sharing this :) "
"How do you not see that bringing another guy home in the middle of the night, playing music loud enough to wake your bf up and then leaving to go to this guys house wouldn’t upset your boyfriend? You are the selfish and immature one here. Sure, your boyfriend had an emotional and intense reaction, but you are no victim. You’re willingly hanging out with a known dealer with a child on the way (?!) who your boyfriend doesn’t trust... that’s so disrespectful and just really lame. Reevaluate your life choices/who you surround yourself with, and either shape up for yourself and your boyfriend, or let him go find someone who will respect him."
I looked at all your responses and you don't want advice. You dont want help. You want enablers to tell you that this is ok. But it's not. 
That's a bad sign. If I were Nick I would be very curious to see my exact doppelganger and very eager to prove my innocence to you.
"He needs to: move away when she touches him, tell her that her flirty texts are inappropriate, ask her to not touch him. He needs to not blame you—it can’t be “sorry, this is making thrwaaayyy9476 uncomfortable” because that’s not fair to you. 

And although it’s difficult for you, you may need to help him get into situations where he’ll make more friends. Do you guys have hobbies?"

" You need to sit down with him and discuss what is happening with his friends, and then pivot to how it effects your relatinship.  Tell him that trying to control you isn't going to help, but openly and honestly discussing the situation will help.

"If she felt guilty ordering too much then I have no idea why she didn’t feel guilty making my parents feel horrible at the table. Her comments were so unnecessary with things like “wow I can’t believe people actually eat pigeon, that’s nasty” when my mom had suggested the restaurant and had been there before years earlier (which she also knew btw).

I told her about my parents suggestion for the restaurant beforehand and even sent her a link to the menu but she acted annoyed like I was making too much of a fuss. If she had actually looked at the menu she could’ve asked her questions long before he actual dinner."

"I'm bisexual, and not trying to ""box"" you in, but are you sure? Just because someone is able to have sex with a man does not a passionate penislover make, you know? I don't linger on the other sex when I am in a relationship, but you really seem to be missing an important component. To me it sounds a lot like that thing you're lacking is living as a lesbian. "
"Wow, your poor daughter. "
" &gt; I mentioned that I would support whatever decision he made and that I would go with him if he decided that was what he wanted to do.

Sounds like you made your position quite clear, OP. Nicely done.

Just keep doing this in the future. I think MIL secretly wants an in to figure out either **A)** *what her status is with the family without actually having to go* or **B)** *someone to scope out the drama for her*.

Either way, continue to communicate the way you did and it will work out just fine."
"I'm 37 weeks pregnant myself and I can honestly say that my pet hate throughout my entire pregnancy is when other pregnant women blame absolutely everything from how they are feeling to what they can and can't do just because they are pregnant...it isn't an illness. 

However, if your wife has other members of her family that are noticing a huge change in her behaviour and mood then it's maybe time she spoke to her doctor or you and her spoke about getting her to speak to someone about her mood and how she's feeling emotionally. Pregnancy does mess with hormones and I'm not disputing that but if her behaviour is completely erratic and unlike her then she should speak to a professional. "

"Your mom should have your best interests in mind. It's time for her to get past this, grow up, and stop using you as a pawn in her relationship with your dad.

I remember that post you’re talking about. People would go up to her in the grocery store talking about how brave her ex was for coming out and how much happier he was now. And she was so angry and betrayed and felt so alone. Poor lady. I hope she’s doing better these days.

"OP's replies are concerning me. I don't think he gets it at all. I see him complaining and adding to thoughts he's already had along with further examples of her abusive behavior, but there doesn't seem to be a lightbulb moment here.

His girlfriend sounds like a cartoon version of a character's gf that everyone else hates, but somehow the main character can't see it. 

This guy is being flat out used and abused. The time for whining and complaining is long over, OP. Your girlfriend might be one of the worst human beings I've ever heard disguised as a girlfriend on here. She's truly vile and I'm sorry you've wasted three years of your life with this cow.

Stop complaining and just break up. Go. "
"Yeah, see this is how I started out on your side and the more I thought about it, the more you manage to get me on the other side.

Your kid will find out because she'll be curious and because the world will tell her. I remember having my 6-year-old mind blown when I found out women could be president of the US. Or when I was 8 and overheard the school bully calling a girl a lesbian. Or when I was 10 and arguing against my SCIENCE TEACHER who was trolling our class about there being no women scientists.

Your child will be their own person and they will interact with the world without you and sooner than you think. "
"Move on, probably broke up to cheat on you with someone else.  There are loads of other people, find one."
"I learned that there's a distinction made between alcohol addiction/abuse and dependence. From your description, it sounds like he may be dependent on alcohol. 

I'm not sure how benadryl interacts with alcohol, but aren't you supposed to abstain when you take most medications? (Genuine question, I'm not sure).

There's a lot of things he can try to help his insomnia that don't include alcohol. Black out shades, white noise/rain noise playing, retraining himself to associate bed with sleep and sleep only (not sitting on bed to watch TV, for example), taking melatonin before bed, picking a time for sleep every night and sticking to it, not watching media/playing with phone before bed... 

What I'm getting at is that I'm sure there's a lot of trial and error stuff he can try, and I'm not sure how much of it he has. Sleep is important for health, so if he has tried a lot already he should consider going to a doctor and not just killing his liver simply so he can sleep each night. 

I hope you guys figure it out soon! "
don't force a marriage because of deadlines and practicalities. Divorce is way more expensive than some lost deposits.

"Point out that car safety standards have gone up since 1999 and she's endangering herself and the children needlessly.  I'm betting that car doesn't have side airbags.  It certainly doesn't meet the side-impact and roof-crush requirements that began in the 2000s.  It doesn't have Electronic Stability Control, required as of 2012.

"Just wanted to echo all of these concerns. My partner is a foot taller than I am and 80 pounds heavier and has never physically hurt me. And it's not because we don't joke around, he picks me up, tickles me, does physical things jokingly and never hurts me. Not knowing your own strength is not a thing unless you're literally an x-men. When he has actually accidentally hurt me (once he let go of a toy our dog was tugging on and it hit me in the face) he has immediately expressed concern, sympathy, and apologized. And even ""joking"" about killing you in response to you expressing that he hurt you is a huge red flag. It's really, really alarming. "

"If you are being excessively demanding of another human being, it's not going to come across in a list like this. It's going to come across when you are confronted with the small daily mistakes, slip-ups, bad moods and miscommunications that otherwise decent people will always experience. 

For most people, their ""list"" isn't excessive. It's a matter of degrees and fine print. For example: You may put on the list ""Must have a decent job."" but if 'decent' to you means $500,00K salary and 10 weeks paid vacation, that would probably be excessive. 

Frankly, from your list it sounds like you may be the sort who expects your partner to do a tonne of emotional labour and service for you. You sound like you are looking for a dominant personality who will moderate and direct your emotional state and motivate you. That's a lot to expect. That attitude could certainly turn excessively demanding and unfair very quickly. 

But that's just my impression from the bit you have here, and like I said, a list tells us very, very little. How you deal day to day will reveal whether or not you are being unreasonable in your demands from another human being."
"Do you want to be with someone who views being with you as a ‘meh’ choice or do you want to be with someone for whom you are a ‘FUCK YES’. You deserve to be with someone who WANTS you.

"Well, he lost the love of his life, he's desperately lonely, he has no one, no prospects, no time to date, and chances are no woman in the future is going to want to sign a prenup either. So OP can enjoy his life of loneliness.

His ex, on the other hand, is in a loving relationship, engaged to be married, and pregnant with a baby with a man she loves. They're going to have a little family. And this man loves her so much that he defended her with class and dignity, and there are good enough couple that they have plenty of loving friends and family who have rallied around them. She really doesn't sound like much of a gold digger Toomey, she sounds like a very lovely woman, who is family-oriented, who finally has the life she always wanted. The life she could have had with OP, if he wasn't the one so blinded by money and assets and fortunes that he let something beautiful slip right through his fingers. Someone in the relationship was obsessed with gold, and it wasn't his girlfriend.

But yes, stick to those principles about the prenup! Nothing, and I mean nothing is more important than that cold hard cash. Nothing at all. Nothing. At. All.

Right, OP? 

Go check your bank balances again, OP. I'll bet they're doing great. No need to worry about any women spending your money. All your money is safe and protected. It's all right there. No worries. "
"The next time she invites you out for dinner say “sure I’d love to go out with you guys, but only if we all pay our own bill” make sure she knows what the expectation is before hand. Then when she unsurprisingly pulls the “thanks for paying” thing at the restaurant say “nope! We talked about this. We are all paying our own bill.”

Part of being an adult is setting boundaries and making sure that they are respected. This means sometimes having uncomfortable conversations. So speak up, and don’t allow yourself to be taken advantage of. 

Speak to your girlfriend ahead of time, and make sure that she knows that you expect her to verbally support you, if her mother tries to make you pay even after you have already told her she is to pay for herself.  If your partner is wife material, she will support you in this. Remember you want a partner who is a team player, and who doesn’t leave you to look like the bad guy, when confrontation arises, especially between you and your in laws. "

"The comment box instructions are telling me to be constructive so I will do my best despite your willful misunderstanding of my point.

Assuming you know better than what someone of either gender says they want is wrong. People do this all the time, it is true, and I wish they would shut up and believe people like myself and your brother. 

Misogyny happens because of the power imbalance between the genders in which making this assumption about women is vastly more damaging to them than it is to men. Women are constantly equated only with their ability to bear children, told they are only thinking or acting or feeling things based on their hormones, and dismissed for these reasons.

We discuss the flipside of this issue all the time, in that men are not taken seriously as fathers, are denied family leave, are made fun of for being stay at home parents, etc, and that is also a problem that needs to be addressed.

But a guy being told that he will change his mind about kids is not the same as a women being told that because society is still trying to recover from the long-pervasive idea that this is all a women is good for, and that is why it is misogyny. "
"Yiissssssss, dessert baby!"
A 50 year old pursuing someone he thinks is 19 is the most concerning detail here.
"The reality is that he's gonna get worse after they get married, because once she's bound to him legally it's a lot harder for her to leave thanks to societal expectations, financial dependence, potential kids, etc. That's how abusers roll, they escalate once their target is locked down. I seriously doubt these are the only two instances. He may be emotionally violent as well.

She might need to hear from someone else that he has the potential to get worse since it sounds like she's aware it's problematic but she's not sure if it's something over which she should end the relationship. Abuse victims tend to doubt themselves heavily because their abusers train them to do so."

"If you’re an ass than your SO is a bigger one. 

If after 5 hours of silence he responds to your polite text with “yeah well it doesn’t matter I’m always wrong and the bad guy,” then he knows good and well he was wrong and he just gets defensive when faced with it. 

The things you said afterwards might sound dramatic but it’s clearly a buildup of emotions and frustrations you’ve had for a while. In other comments you say you’ve discussed certain issues with him repeatedley. So he knows what’s wrong. He’s just not doing anything to change it. 

The fact that he responded by packing up and leaving without a word tells me he’s the person that ruined this relationship. Not you. "

"Again, this is a person, forced through economic pressure, not because it’s a sane choice.

"So, there was a study a 95% of women that decide they want abortions are actually fine afterwards. To read it, google ""Hardly Any Women Regret Having An Abortion Time Magazine"", which summarizes the study and has the article as well. I'm not saying that would be you, but the notion that most abortions are emotionally scarring is just not the reality (and probably a lot from the religious groups that campaign against it).

That doesn't mean *you *should get an abortion. This is a personal decision, and you aren't a statistic. But it might be worth including in your decision making process that not everyone who gets an abortion feels terrible about it afterwards, in fact it's the opposite. You still need to decide what would work best for you."

Tell her the real test was ""Can we clear up a miscommunication by having a conversation like two adults?"" and *she* failed. "
Yea sounds like seeing baby was secondary. How you extrapolated that they were there to help out with the baby is beyond me. I didn't realise going to celebrate your sibling's birthday and see his kid automatically meant you were there to help put with baby chores. 
"Agreeing with Shieya that your best chance of having the most people believe you is for your ""friend"" to publicly take responsibility.

Do not attempt to contact your ex. Do not attempt to pass messages or ask other people to contact her on your behalf. If people contact *you*, give them your version of events and expect that they probably won't believe you.

&gt;He got worse, going on about how her fiance was probably raising a kid that wasn't his because he's a beta (not sure what that means exactly)

It means he's a toxic asshole.

Some people may accept your explanation and believe that you're just a guy who regrets messing up a good relationship and was screwed over by a shitty friend. Others may agree with your ""friend"" that you're being ""too nice"" and that those messages, or at least the sentiments behind them, are acceptable. Be wary of such people and do not let yourself get sucked in to their shittiness. Not only will that send a clear message to everyone else that they're fully correct to judge you harshly, but it'll make you a worse and unhappier person, too."

It hasn't happened but I KNOW if something happened to my dad and I actually woke my bf up he would immediately start comforting me even if he had work and it was the middle of the night. Because he has a pattern of being sweet and comforting.

You need to not internalize your negative emotions but find a healthy outlet, and to communicate better what you need or what the situation is. However your fiance responding to you with ""people will think I'm abusing you so stfu"" like WTF?!?!?! Who thinks that?! Who says it to someone they're supposed to love? And then cutting you off?

I don't know why so many commenters are trying to explain away this crappy behavior with ""you woke him up and he was groggy for over half an hour"" when that's not true but I really disagree with them and I wouldn't want to date your fiance if that would be the response to my grief."

"Your situation doesn't seem to apply to him, considering other comments he made below:

"His attitude is so off-putting that he would need one hell of an explanation before I listened to him.

Not having professional hair and makeup done is one thing, but telling your fiance that you won't help her pay for her wedding dress and veil is something that I wouldn't be able to move past. I couldn't imagine myself marrying someone who would be so uncaring towards me when he wants to marry me. "
"Okay, first of all I don't know what your definition of ""housewife"" is, but having a job that allows her to work out of the home is not it. It sounds like she is content in her job and maybe plans to do that job the rest of her life. There is nothing wrong with that. However, you feel that she has more potential or is wasting her life/talents/whatever away. That's OK to feel that way, but if that's truly how both of you feel, then I think you need to go separate ways. You want her to do more and she doesn't want to. If you stay together and nothing changes, resentment is likely going to creep in. You say she pays the bills, so besides putting stuff on a CC instead of making sure she has the money, I don't see a big issue financially. If you are not content with how the finances are divided, then you both need to have a sit down conversation about it. Also, I think it's rude to call her lazy. I do not know her in real life, but she is working, she's paying bills...that doesn't seem lazy to me. Lazy would mean someone who sits around all day and does nothing with their life. "
"It took a long time for me to realize ""being nice"" was my equivalent of letting people steamroll me. I'm extremely non-confrontational (except among friends or family lol then I'm a short ball of spitfire!) but back before I became more assertive, in a situation like this, I'd grit my teeth and try to be patient. It can be really hard to grow a backbone when you hate confronting others and panic attacks from doing so!"

"My father has diagnosed autism, and when I read your post, I couldn't help but think ""oh god, he's like my father."" Get your husband some help ASAP if you want to salvage your marriage. It gets really emotionally taxing to have to listen to someone rant obsessively about things in a non-constructive manner 24/7.

Also, he needs help if he wants to ever have a good relationship with your son. It's really hard to establish a solid emotional attachment to a parent with autism."
"Don't say it's because of your dick, just keep it general.  

Protip (no pun intended): Don't talk about your cock size with women.  There is absolutely nothing more cringe-y than a guy who does this.  "
For the same reason anyone gets upset when the person they broke up with starts dating again. Just because she initiated the divorce doesn't mean there may not have been a glimmer of hope in the back of her mind.
"If my SO said they were embarrassed I ordered chicken instead of pasta and they meant it sincerely, I’d at the very least postpone the wedding. Because wtf. "
"Though if she does ever want a relationship with this girl, even a polite rejection may hurt this possibly abused teen so much that she won’t get another chance. A few years in therapy and waiting for the kid to grow up will seem like a *lifetime* to this girl, and may seem less like a “delay” while she has “things on her plate” and more like a “no” followed by her seeking the kid out when she felt like it or remembered she had a sibling. "
"I was going to say, he's not offering any solutions or stepping in to the situation to be a part of any of the working out of this problem, but what he does seem to be doing is saying, ""Work it out amongst yourselves, children, I can't be bothered."""
This is the correct answer.
"Trust your gut. If you're not ready, you're not ready. Honestly, I'd advise you to wait longer than a month or two from now, unless you suddenly have some kind of epiphany about you two being in a much better spot than you were a month ago. 
Sit her down as soon as possible and let her know that you love her and still feel like you should get married in the future, but that you'd like more time to build and strengthen your relationship, and talk over long-term plans. Don't wait until just before the vacation, in case she's telling more people. "
She doesn't consider you important so I don't think you should consider her important. 
"I'd suggest that you tell him about it. It might not be ""your place"" to but if you're someone who cares about your dad and doesn't want him to keep being blind to the situation it might be better to "
"Did SHE feel “taken care of”? She initiated, then it sounds like the actual sex was only a few minutes. Always make sure the girl is nice and taken care of even if the actual sex doesn’t last very long. Communication is the key to a good relationship. "
"If you think of your partner as replaceable then you don't have the right partner.

Not to mention that my sister's are my half sister's - my mother was married before she met my father and had them from that marriage. Their biological father wanted nothing to do with them after the divorce and eventually they stopped trying to see him. 

When my mother met my father he raised them and loved them. He walked my sister down the aisle. They consider HIM their father and not their biological father.

Family are replaceable if they are not a loving dedicated family member"
"There you go. You're paying it forward. 

I inherited a decent amount of money as an adult, and I offered to pay my mom back for giving me the tuition money for grad school. She told me that she didn't want a dime, but that I should make college/grad school a possibility for someone else, whether it were my own future kids or some other young person who could use a leg up. 

If your dad had his priorities in the right place, he'd think that you helping other foster kids was the best possible way to honor the choice he made with your mom to adopt you. Unfortunately, he's an unrepentant douchebag instead. You should feel great about the way you're honoring your grandfather's legacy.
"
"Holy shit dude. I don't know that there's a way to cure that level of enmeshment. Marrying him won't change it- in fact, it may make it worse. Then you're truly ""part of the family"" and it would be expected to do this 100% of the time. This sounds like the beginning of one of those horror stories where your honeymoon gets crashed as a ""family vacation."" And what happens if a family member needs a place to stay? Are you expected to spend 24/7 with them if they live with you too? 

Point being, this is a willful blind spot on his part. You've expressed extremely reasonable boundaries and he's not interested. You may want to consider ending it, which sucks but this doesn't seem to have an end in sight if he's not even willing to consider a compromise. "
Seriously. We've got a toilet that wastes water and I pee a lot so I've been waiting to flush until after a few pees. But my husband told me it bugs him so I flush now. Just basic respect for the other person living in my house. Not flushing is a sign her boyfriend is lazy but also a sign he doesn't respect her.

"&gt;someone called Brooke my work wife
&gt;never given one another birthday gifts
&gt; She surprised me today with tickets to my favorite hockey team for my birthday
&gt;she surprised me when she game back and had tickets for another game for the next weekend. She told me she knows a season ticket holder and if the next weekend didn't work, we can find one that does.

Are you really that oblivious...? Why would she want to go away for a weekend with you, just the two of you, without your fiancee? Why would she not just give you the tickets for your fiancee and yourself? 

&gt;She said it was inappropriate to go away for the weekend with another woman and to ignore her and all my friends who set aside time that weekend already for me.

Jealousy aside, isn't this your 30th birthday? Your fiancee is totally right. It is inappropriate.

I'm a straight female, my SO is a straight male. If he wanted to go away for the weekend with a straight male friend of his, great. If he wanted to go away for the weekend with a straight female friend of his, just the two of them? Hell to the no. And he would feel the exact same way about me going away with a guy. It's not that we don't trust each other, it's simply inherently inappropriate.

I would never even consider giving my closest straight male friends a weekend-away type present that involved me being there instead of their partners. This stinks to high heaven, and hopefully you're just oblivious to that.

Time to tone down on your friendship with Brooke if you want to have a decent future with Meredith."
"This advice has been reiterated thousands of times in this sub, maybe more.

**Being drunk doesn't excuse your actions, it just lowers your inhibition.** 

Also, you were sober enough to confess to him, try to kiss him, remember what he said and him leaving so I guess you weren't *out of your mind* drunk. 

Wanting to confess to and kiss an involved man is disrespecting him, his partner and their relationship. He sounds like a good guy and said probably the things you deserved to hear. You encouraged cheating if you wanna look at it in a black and white manner. 

You can do whatever you want now, as the other posters are saying but be prepared if the guy doesn't immediately forgive you and wanna be buddy-buddy again. 

My advice, apologize and give him space and accept how he takes it, if he does at all. "
"She's 100% cheating on you, stop letting her convince you otherwise.

"I think this would have been seen as douchey even in the 50s. ""Taken down a few pegs,"" really? My sassy old granny would have had some choice words for that. "
"It took time to create those relationships, it will take time to change them.  It does sound like it's working.  They key is to be consistent.  I know that you find social interaction tough.  Can I suggest, instead of looking for emotional intimacy, start with just being polite and build on that.  Mere politeness can take you a long way in building rapport.  It's awesome you've made this much progress.  Remember, people don't know what's going on inside.  We judge people by their actions because that's all we've got to go by if they don't give us another narrative.  New behavior changes that narrative.  Keep it up. Goos luck to you."
I can only imagine the facebook truths that this friend tells OP's wife.
"&gt; I had asked if she was seeing anybody, and she said no. 

Seriously, WUT? That’s an actual lie. Right to your face, a major lie.  *Who does that*? Run from these people."
"Why are you assuming the guys had the power? I am picky about who I form a relationship with, Ive had casual sex, and there are plenty of guys who tried desperately to be in a relationship with me after I slept with them, and I was the one who said no."

"After your parents pass away and David wants to live with you, let him. How is this a problem?"
"I do feel sorry for my aunt and uncle. Looks like either way they're going to lose a daughter. 

I do feel like Alice was the one that put her parents in an impossible situation, not Kelly. Her sister's fiance, really? There's no other man out there? 

But yes, it's hard for her parents, especially as they get older."
"The networking is largely because since I'm not physically present in my industry except for these time periods, I have to make up for a lot of time that I miss out now that I'm basically a visitor in my city. This job is competitive and I am (although starting to slip) considered one of the top 20 providers of this service out of thousands according to metrics.

If I were present more often, it would be an eight hour day and a completely easy one, but since I have to fit a month of work into 10 days, I frequently am working on multiple projects and job-sites within a day that are all across southern california."

She's going to leave you if you don't sort this out soon. Why did you say you'd propose if you don't even want to get married?
"You could have diplomatically said you two are different people, but that is part of her charm for you."
"This not immaturity, this is pure manipulation and your boyfriend knows what he's doing. My ex did this to me all the time and it was absolutely terrible. He would call me names, put me down in front of others, get overly defensive about mindless things, etc and then tell me that it was all a joke when I'd get upset about it. It's just designed to take the blame off themselves and make you start to question your judgement about the situation. People like this basically just keep doing it to test your boundaries and see how much abuse they can get away with. They almost never admit that they've done anything wrong or apologize.

Honestly, get rid of this guy. This behaviour doesn't change and you'll just constantly go in circles when trying to explain your feelings. My ex went to counselling 3 different times and never once did he ever mention any of this behaviour to his therapist because he didn't see it as an issue. To him, it was my issue and something I needed to fix. It's very frustrating and I'm sorry that you're having to deal with this."
"As someone that aborted a fetus I loved and wanted to keep, solely to appease the other person, please follow your heart. I regret my decision every day.

My heart goes out to you, OP. ❤️"
"Can I add something that even though OP is trying to help now, when he was the same age as his brother, he was in no place to do so? He had to get his life in order before he was ready to help him otherwise they would both be in a really bad place."
"&gt; (she hit a toddler hard enough that attempted murder charges were considered)

That right there is enough to cut anyone out of your life, no matter their relationship to you. I would honestly block her and ignore her. "
"Ack. In the future, the point of having the ""unplanned pregnancy discussion,"" is so that everyone is on board with the course of action *before* an accident happens. That way you and he could both avoid the situation you're in now. Talking about it and not coming up with a plan of action is kinda pointless.

Anyway, you guys are the poster couple for ""not ready for a kid."" Given your situation I think that if you're honest with yourself there is no happily ever after for you guys if you have this kid. You've got years ahead of struggle and misery and regret. Plus, he might even bail since he doesn't want it. Not to mention your mental health issues... it will be a disaster and he will most likely definitely resent you like you fear.

This all may sound harsh but I'm assuming you do actually want to head our true interpretations and not some sugar coated ""everything will be okay."" You're looking at a future of living in a trailer with a kid you weren't ready for, struggling to make ends meet. It's a story as old as time. "
"This is literally how my parents did things, once our immediate needs were taken care of. Our bedtime as children was non-negotiable, we knew it was enforced to make sure mum and dad had their evenings together. Sometimes, especially in summer when it was still light at 9pm my sister and I would be awake and playing but we knew mum and dad were having their time and we respected that. 

Ditto some weekends, when we would go to stay with aunty and uncle and they would head off to spend a weekend together. My parents loved us fiercely, but they weren't empty nesters. Once we left and got married they loved being able to be a couple together again. My dad died a few years ago, but mum said they never let their love ever become second in our family. They needed to work together as a team, or the entire family would have failed. 

I love the o2 mask metaphor mentioned in another comment. Children (to some, I'm super childfree!) of course change the family. But I don't believe they should come absolutely first at the expense of husband and wife (or significant other and significant other) time. United you'll stand, divided you'll all fall. "

"They're typical Indian parents so if I don't Skype them one day, they'd expect me to the next. I could easily talk to them once a week briefly but there's no way they'd take that. 

The day I told them I was at programming club I texted them saying I'd call the day after because I needed space and my dad said 'not today, call back or I'm coming to your uni.' 

I honestly have no idea what to do."

"He did not choose the middle ground. There is no middle ground, no neutral in something like this. He either believes his children or he doesn't. He either cares about the safety and well-being of his children, or he doesn't. He either tells the step-mother to stop lying to his extended family or he doesn't. If he does not intervene on your behalf then he is choosing her."
"Agreed. If the only reasons she thinks she looks ugly is because she doesn’t wear makeup, doesn’t dress hipster/sexy, and has a plain haircut, then those aren’t reasons. Sure, maybe some people won’t like that, but plenty of people will. I know people who check all those boxes and not only are they pretty, they have long term SOs. "
Lol. I find myself siding with your wife.
"I'm so grateful to read your comment. This is my experience almost exactly growing up with an abusive, narcissistic parent. If you get punished and shamed for having negative emotions, then of course you learn to hideous them to protect yourself. While it's unhealthy, it's understandable. Plus OP clearly sees her bad habits and is working to fix them. 

It's so disheartening reading the comments telling OP how she could have done better, while in her own post she acknowledges her issues and clearly tries to hold herself accountable. Meanwhile, when she tries to explain her needs to her significant other, he cuts her off mid sentence and tells her he doesn't want to deal with it right now.

Its also been my experience that these issues attract a certain kind of partner. Typically, these are people who would rather point out and blame faults in others rather than take responsibility for their own shortcomings. It's cruel. She already blames herself so much and is trying not to make her issues his, and he returns the favor by exacerbating her issues.

Spouses should lift each other up, not kick each other when they're down. OP, please don't marry this man until he's as committed to working on issues as you are, and until sufficient progress has been made. You deserve better than you're currently getting. "
"100% yes. Mainly because it would have nothing to do with his father at that point, and everything to do with his complete lack of respect for my feelings. If I can’t trust him to back me up on this, I can’t trust him at all. Also, he doesn’t have a close relationship with his dad, he just hasn’t gone no contact with him. He only talks to him every month or so over the phone and ignores most of his texts, only casually responding to various ones about his younger brother, whatever shows he’s played, and any family updates. The main reason he moved back closer to his mom was because he didn’t want to live with his dad and wasn’t really into the idea of being close to him, so I don’t see in picking his relationship with his dad over me, I just want hard boundaries drawn and to make it clear that if we come around, his disrespect won’t be tolerated even slightly. "
"My partner went through a stage like this. He was highly suspicious of everything I did.
It was exhausting have to constantly explain myself and relaying every detail of an outing.
Eventually I had enough and we sat down and talked through it. (Summarizing a little here).
Turns out he was feeling insecure and depressed.
We got him professional help and we've been better off since. This might be the case with your husband.

"
"Have you ever thought that, in his eyes, that moment in the car was the ""right setting."" You guys spent the entire day together and he did everything you wanted to do and decided to end it with the question you've been waiting to hear. I know it may not have been all that *you* wanted but maybe that was his perfect spur of the moment.

But, like another user asked, is the proposal really more important than the idea of getting married and spending the rest of your life with the man you love? Even this stories, with a couple years down the line, will be a hilarious one to tell when people ask. Why do you feel the need to impress people with your proposal story?

I think proposals have gotten way out of hand, hell even kids asking each other to Prom has to be a big deal nowadays. It almost takes away from the actual day itself."
"When I was in undergrad there were the occasional 30, 40, hell even 70 year olds in class. It got a ""hmm interesting"" from me or in the case of the 70 year old, a ""damn that's awesome"" (it was a calc 2 class). But yeah no one will bat an eye towards anyone in class and if they do, they're assholes"
well then you need to step up. it's not fair for you to get to play cool dad while she's in charge of enforcing bed time and room cleaning. you need to be united.
"Out of the two crap abusers I dated, *both* of them started out by making me feel bad and guilty for wearing makeup. Even just eyeliner and mascara. "
"Warn him now that these things typically get better and better over the weeks and months, and then when it's practically a done deal, there is a sudden relapse.  All the sudden it will be like you are torturing her to make her sleep alone.  She had a bad dream, tummy ache, doesn't feel good, scared of the bad men, and so on.  This is a crisis point.  If he gives in, he's going to be stuck with issues along this line for YEARS!  He has to stay strong and suck it up for 2 or 3 nights of no sleep as he constantly puts her back to bed, then it will be like magic happened and it's over.

My middle sister had this happen and caved.  She was tired so she just let her son sleep in her bed ""just one more time"" when he was 4.  He then needed to either sleep in their room or have someone lay with him till he fell asleep until he was 9.  Her 11 year old daughter still sleeps with her.  My son was the same, except that I held firm.  And I've talked with a number of other parents that have said something similar occured."
"But he already has another one? And op cites guilt as his reason for a second one, not necessity. It’s a 2 month supposed-to-be part-time retail job, not his career. "
"Take a breath. There could be other explanations here. 1- maybe she took birth control before for medical reasons and when she told you she hadn't taken it before was because she hadn't been taking it for the express purpose of sex. 2- maybe she took it briefly and to her it didn't count because she stopped before actually having sex with it. 3- maybe her own memory is hazy. I've taken birth control in the past. I couldn't tell you which years or for how long because I honestly forget. Taking the pill becomes such a background action your brain doesn't hold onto that info. 4- maybe she lied on the survey because she'll get points or money or something for answering the way she did.

But also, stop reading your wife's email."
"Jesus what an asshole.

Let me correct that for you: ""He makes me so happy as long as I don't express my feelings""

"As far as I am aware, she has never been cheated on. When she was in high school, she cheated on her boyfriend, but it was kissing and not actual sex. That was also over 10 years ago. "
"Yeah, see reading your post, I honestly think there is nothing wrong with a prenup. I think legally making arrangements for the worst case scenario is a good idea in the long run. It was this sentance that stood out:

&gt;I called the engagement off, thinking that maybe she'd see reason but she said ""fine"" and just handed me my ring back, packed her things up and moved out. 

Sooooo you tried to guilt trip and manipulate an ""ultimatum"" when your fiance wasn't doing what you wanted and she called you on that bluff. In fact, she threw it straight back at you. And so she should have, I would have done the same thing if someone tried to use an emotional blackmail like that.

That's how you dealt with your ""disagreement"", the fact that your checking in on her 3 years later with the comment ""she moved on fast"" then your mysterious ""friend"" suddenly writes out what you were thinking (she's a gold digger, and a loser for not sticking with you).

Yeah, no one is going to believe your ""it was muh friend"" story. Man up, take the hit, get the hell on with your life and leave her alone."
"It's no one's fault. She's probably just disappointed in herself for not sticking to her original ""goal"" of waiting a few months."
"In my opinion (as a 19 year old girl in a relationship) being upset at your gf for looking at her phone every half hour for a few minutes is insanely needy. You're going to have a hard time not coming across that way.. I would be very annoyed if my boyfriend asked that of me. On the other hand, my boyfriend is on his phone WAYYY more than I am and it drives me nuts sometimes. If it's really bothering me I usually say ""Hey will you put the phone down? I want to spend some quality time with you right now."" Then I give him a kiss and tell him I love him and that almost always does the trick! "
"&gt; Would you really expect him to be rude to his friends just so he could please you?

I think you're missing the point.  By totally not considering the fact that you'd be gone for Christmas and by not at least discussing your holiday plans with her, you treated her poorly.  This isn't about rudeness to your friend, it's also about how you're treating your girlfriend."
Dude .. too much. She will need that nose in the future.
Pretty much everyone has an ex. Not everyone has multiple side pieces. 
"Jesus. Op, don't listen to any advice about making snarky comments to your parents friends. These people have no clue how interactions with adults work when you have parents trying to raise you right. 

My dad was the same way as your mom. He made me and my brother do chores from a young age. He made us work, he taught us to be responsible and respectful to our elder even when we felt they didn't exactly deserve it. There is no way my dad would have ever been ok with me making rude comments to his friends. Ever. Because he taught me manners. Being a smartass would only and up embarrassing him and there is no way he would stand for that.

There is no winning this if you make a smart ass remark. You'll only get in trouble. Talk to your mom. Tell her how it makes you feel. Tell her it makes you feel like some sort of animal instead of a person. Let the adult deal with the other adult. Then just let it go. Learning how to not let what other people say affect you is also a valuable skill to have in the adult world as well."

"Well...he wasn't a good friend to you here, because he put you in a really shitty position. His selfishness finally affected you and I think you're now realizing it was selfish of YOU that you only cared about his behavior when it made your life harder.

If he's truly working on being a better person, maybe you two can reconnect down the line but for now I'd end the friendship out of respect to Jessie and because you're a reflection of the people you spend time with, and as he is this guy is not a good look."

"Oh man I remember your first post where everyone was telling you to get out again too! The glasses thing was one of the most disrespectful and awful non-violent behaviors I'd seen in a LONG time on this sub. OP, I'm not going to dissect your post explaining why she's terrible. You know. We know. Everyone knows. This relationship has to end. But nobody is going to rush in to save you. You have to be the one to save yourself. Leave her. Things won't ever get better."
Be thankful you weren't diagnosed a cabbage.
"This is ridiculous. He's ridiculous. Break up ASAP. Stop feeling guilty. That, in and of itself, is ridiculous. Learn how to trust your instincts and your gut otherwise you're in for a really shitty and sad dating life. "
"FYI, talking about this while everybody is in the same room is almost a surefire way to get it resolved.  I am willing to bet she doesn't have the balls to demand a second apology in front of your father, and if she does, then you can explain your point of view, and ask your father if he thinks you should have ignored what the fire department said."
"So, you're wife has been pretty consistently clear that she wants to stay in your current location because that's where family is and it's where she wants to raise the kids.  She has a job that she wouldn't be able to get in the area you applied to.  She asked you not to apply to places that weren't in the area she wants to stay in.  

And yet you're somehow confused as to why she wouldn't be happy that you want her to just pick up her life and move to someplace she doesn't want to be?

Dude, did you even bother to consider your wife's thoughts and feelings before going ahead and doing exactly what you wanted to because you wanted to?  Your entire post is all about what YOU want, what YOU need, what's best for YOU.  And you want to know how to convince your wife to give up everything SHE hold valuable for YOUR personal desires.

At this point, she's told you what her limits are.  She's not moving, just like she told you she wasn't going to do.  So, you can either move without her or stay with her.  Choice is yours.

Just remember, if you stay and get resentful, you did this to yourself.  If you had actually bothered to listen to your wife and consider that she was actually telling you what she was feeling, you wouldn't have put yourself in a position to have to make this decision.

Personally, I'd recommend you turn down the job and get some couples therapy so you can learn to actually listen when your wife tells you what she needs.  Because if you don't, she might just leave you anyway."
She definitely does not like it when I leave her alone. She thinks it's selfish of me to rather stay home alone and do nothing instead of going out with her and her friends. 
"I would also see this as a dealbreaker. It's one thing to be neutral and respectful towards religion, and another to insult and look down at people who believes.

"I have 2 comments.

#1: several easy fixes for this problem. A) Pick a dinner time and stick to it. For example, agree together that every day at 7pm you will begin cooking dinner and it will be served at 7:30 sharp. If he gets home early, too bad he has to wait a bit. If he gets home late, he can eat leftovers. B) stay out each evening and don't come back home until you know he is back. Go out with friends, go to the gym, volunteer after work, etc. Don't just sit around at home for hours waiting for him. Have your own life. C) refuse to cook any more meals for him until he straightens up.

#2: he sounds like a mean spirited dude, I would hate to be married to someone like him. Don't put up with his BS. Insist he straighten up or consider leaving him if he won't."
"Piggybacking on this - it sounds like your late husband's family is still in the picture (as they should be).

What role dies he have in mind for your former MIL, your children's grandmother? Or is she supposed to vanish to, so as not to threaten your fiance's fragile ego?"
Sounds like a sweet kid.
"If this a problem, you need to do more work on yourself..."
"Liking it a little is only human. You don’t need to feel guilty about your thoughts - you made the right choice in saying no. 

It’s worth being clear with your wife, so she knows what’s happened. How do you think she’ll feel about this? Does she know your neighbour?"
"You don’t feel like a priority, because you aren’t. You can’t be all the love and caring in this relationship for the both of you. Or the one being more financially savvy... having him blow all his money in a week and then leaving all the heavy lifting to you will get old as well.

I’m sorry he ruined your anniversary and birthday, and no money is no excuse. You can make a day special by showing you care and remembered, it doesn’t take fancy dinners and expensive trips, though those are nice.

Maybe by your next birthday you’ll have someone who is awesome enough to remember and make you a priority."
"She obviously (at least in this incident) thinks the world revolves around her and maybe likes having boys 'wrapped around her finger' or something.  

I've known people like this. They don't consider other people's feelings.

Totally agree with all the other comments, OP. You aren't in the wrong, that girl was disrespectful not only of your relationship and your own feelings, but also your boyfriend's feelings (even though he was fine with it, she didn't know that). 

I think it's wildly inappropriate for anyone to ask *you* to apologise when it was this girl who was disrespectful and stepping over the line.

"100% make sure you let your son know that his dad is wrong. That the way he talks to your son is not OK. That you don't think any of the mean things dad says are true. That you love him, that you are on his side, and that you want to work with him on a plan to make him safe from this cruel verbal abuse. Get some legal advice, and some advice from a better counsellor (because this is abuse). "
"Sounds like she is doing what’s best for her. She talked it over with her therapist, who is most likely a reasonable person.  As a recovering addict the stress of a houseguest for an unlimited time could cause her to relapse. She needs to focus more on herself for her well being ands well as yours. 

I thinks she is being extremely kind to allow your fiancé to stay for two weeks. That’s the absolute most I could ever stand to have a houseguest and that’s if I already know and feel very comfortable with them. Have your fiancé and your mom ever talked with each other? I wouldn’t feel comfortable with a stranger living with me. I’m guessing since you live in different countries and by your age that you and your fiancé have never actually met in real life. So, while you may feel comfortable talking online things may be far different when she is staying with you. I wouldn’t be surprised if your mother may be thinking of you and how you (considering your condition) may be unable to handle your guest for so long. 

While your fiancé comes from a bad home, it’s not your mothers responsibility to take care of her. She needs to take care of herself and to a lesser extent (now that your an adult) you. "
"That type of drinking can be dangerous. You sound like your are looking at it from the right view point of concern though instead of being angry and shaming her. 

To be honest, I am also this girl. I cant control my alcohol intake very well. I often end up way too drunk (and have done some wildly embarrassing and disgraceful things, much more so than your gf). Idk your girlfriend, but if she's like me- she can't help it. I can set out at the beginning of the night and say I'm not going to get trashed- and then I take a sip of alcohol and TRANSFORM. It takes the person I'm with monitoring me and cutting me off to stop it. Or I have to just not drink at all. 

Maybe just discussing with her with compassion will help though. My ex's were only ever angry and shamed me, and it didnt really make me want to stop. "
"Hey OP, don't call it a mistake. You made a perfectly logical decision with the information you at hand. Don't beat yourself up over trusting someone you called a friend. This is absolutely in now way shape or form your fault"
You've been together almost 5 years. Do you want to marry her?  Would she be happy with an inexpensive plain band and a long engagement? 
"And if he'd shot himself or overdosed, the family would be just as devastated and say they didn't see it coming. 34 really is an extraordinarily young age to lose a child and it hasn't been long at all. I mean there are lots of obese smokers who don't die at 34. I think judging the deceased and the parent's method of mourning is misplaced and not helpful. OP should just do a slow fade and start not going over there as much and not volunteering to take on their finances. "
"I'm sorry for you and your daughter's loss. It sucks to lose someone, even when the relationship is strained at best. 
My question: Is she putting on a service at a funeral home or a church? If it's at a home, it's likely that she can control who goes in or out, especially if it's a private service. If it's at a church, talk to the pastor or priest who is in charge. Preferably in person and with your daughter. I doubt that if you explain you are his legal widow and that your MIL is threatening to exclude you and your daughter that they will condone or allow that. 
Also, if don't find what you need in this thread, maybe try posting this to r/JNMIL. They might have better idea of how to deal with this. "
"pretty much any reaction other than calm, yes. "
"donèt downplay the request for a re-do. 

Just flat out say what you want, you don't need to defend that or explain why.

&gt;  ""Honey, you know what I would really like? When you give me the engagement ring, please do the whole bended-knee, ""Will you marry me"" thing. I really like the romance of the whole gesture and it would make me really happy.""

None of that fluffer ""don't hurt his feelings"" bs. He hurt her feelings by half-assing this moment. He gets to feel some shame, but it doesn't mean he can't use that bad feeling to improve his relationship going forward. "

"Those kind of guys drive me crazy too. It seems disingenuous when someone constantly compliments you, like they’re telling you what they think you want to hear. It’s uncomfortable.

EDIT: I’m not sure this is something you can talk about with him this early on. I’ve addressed it with guys I was friends with before we started seeing each other but I can’t imagine saying something to a guy you’ve only been out with once."
"&gt;I mean, I didn't even know I had any triggers, and I don't think I will always react this way. 

Sometimes things align just right to trigger. In my unprofessional opinion, you were caught off guard and your brain immediately tried to protect you the best way it knew how in a violent situation. Then there was the rush of emotions and memories that came flooding in when you came out of the defense. You might react that way again or you may not ever again, its kinda hard to predict. The important thing is to take care of yourself and take note when something does occur. "
"I am sure that Tinder would give you a better success rate than your current strategy of going after co-workers in relationships.

"Is he paying you rent right now while he lives with you in your townhome? 

&gt; He bought a new car this year and has some credit card debt that he's working on paying down. What do you guys think is the correct answer?

I think he should probably pay off his credit card debt and car debt before buying a house. Does he have a down payment for buying the house saved up? Has he actually been pre-approved for a mortgage? If you're going to be paying for half the mortgage, is your name on the title and mortgage and the whole bit?

I agree with you, I think it's most fair to split shared living expenses by income ratio."
"if you don't want an open marriage, don't have an open marriage. 

I'm sorry OP but it really seems like divorce is the only option here. 
She has hid her lack of satisfaction for almost a decade. She is hiding an affair from you now (poorly) and allowing that man around your children. This doesn't sound like something you can remedy by putting your foot down. And unfortunately counselling would do little if she isn't interested in staying in the relationship in a meaningful way. 

Talk to a family lawyer and see what your options are."
"I really can't get a good feel for the situation from the paragraph you wrote. But usually a good cure for jealousy is gratitude. Shift your focus from what you are lacking to everything that you appreciate in your life. Instead of thinking about the people you don't like at your wedding, try to shift your focus to the people that you DO like. Obviously this is more easy said than done, but it's a habit. Start to change your focus and that should help curb your jealousy a bit. "
"I know what you mean about recontextualising. 

I was dating a guy one time who professed to loving sex. (Ironically, he was pretty shit as a lover lol.). But anyway, he was real into porn, like more porn than I knew existed and some/most of it was pretty gross. It took a while to learn this about him. He finally told that it wasn't just the porn, the porn didn't just click off for him, he basically walked around all day looking at women in sexual terms, not just walking around and suddenly encountering someone he felt an attraction to, but actively looking at women in terms of, Oh she's got big lips, I'll imagine how a blow job from her would feel like. She's got a big ass, I'm imagining how it feel to put my junk up in there. Women of all ages, nobody seemed to be off limits. 

This type of mindset was pretty horrifying to me. He took objectifying women to a whole new level than I was aware of. He really did not seem to see other qualities they had, it was all sexual objectification, and what *really* bothered me is that his attitude was that he had a god-given *right* to do this. It was his right as a man to think of any woman on the planet in some over-sexualized, self-gratifying way. 

It seemed very pervy to me. I see a lot of commenters on this thread are defending sexuality and saying it's bad to be repressed, but there is a mindset that exists that is far beyond that. I don't know if your bf is full tilt that way, or if this is some kind of one-off, but I think the reason you are feeling he is creepy is because you are afraid he's actually a perv, but he's passing himself off as the ""don't repress sex"" kind of person.  

Anyway, I can relate to how you feel. It makes you feel dirty, and not in the good way, lol, there is something cheapening and degrading about it, and it's very off-putting. 

So my advice is do what makes you feel alright about yourself. I'm not sure he's going come out and tell you he's a perv if he actually is, so you might just have to go with your gut about what is actually going on here and what you can live with. Good luck. "
Lmao which one of you is married and how long do you plan on carrying out this emotional affair?  You are not a princess and he is not a prince.  You are not star crossed lovers.  Stop contacting him and move onto.  No more feeding your feelings.
"You need to tell her even if she will break down. It will be worse if she marries the guy. You need to tell her friends to take care of her, after you tell your sister. That guy is not just a creep, he tried to sexually assault you. This is the kind of man that rapes people. You need to tell her, now. She has already spent 5 years with this terrible person. Please do not let her spend more time with him.

Write down what you have to say, schedule a phone/video call to talk about serious stuff when she's not distracted. You should have told her in person, so make up for it by being ready to call your sister twice a day in the future, morning and night, so she isn't lonely, so she takes care of herself and knows you are there for her. 

The situation sucks but you can take control of it, and save your sister.

"
"To add to this, he has mooched off his parents for 10 years of his adult life and still can not afford to buy even modest property. He is a loser and dead weight. Also, rent is not a waste of money. It’s cost of living. That’s like saying paying for your own food is a waste of money if you can eat for free off of other people. He is an overgrown child. "
I know someone who did something similar to this. She invited I think like 40 people and only 2 showed up. It was...interesting to see the fallout. 
"I see no reason why the kid's bedroom can't also be a play-room: If she's worried about wanting to play in the middle of the night, then you guys can teach him to pick up his toys and also find a toy-box that's easy to close securely (then again, the moment you decided to become a parent you understood and accepted the inevitability of sleepless nights. That was your choice, now you learn to live with it.)

Your ability to pay for the house takes precedent here. Junior won't grow up to be an axe-murderer if he doesn't have a ""playroom."""
"I don’t know what state you’re in, but in my state (WA) you can be let out of your lease with no issues based on domestic violence. Basically you write a statement to your landlord/management company and tell them what you’re dealing with and that you are no longer in a safe environment. Legally they let you out. I’ve used it to leave my abusive ex years ago. Might be worth looking into. "
Are you diagnosed with anxiety?
"I thought of this too. Maybe last time as a single white male he was okay, but I might not be... "
Japan is an exceptionally clean and orderly country--you don't even see one piece of trash on the subways anywhere. I'm sure the Japanese would prefer it if smarmy foreigners weren't slumming it up in their parks. This is pure arrogance. 
Why should she send them to you? You seem to be way more interested in strange women's nudes. She did it because you aren't understanding how she's feeling. Hopefully now you do.
"One of my good friends is Greek and her family all yell and namecall when they're mad and then the second they get it out of their system they're fine again. She said that the spouses who married in in her generation (almost none of whom are Greek) spend the first several years being SUPER uncomfortable and then they get used to it.

Also, haha oh god, my former roommate who is Cuban. She always says ""we're not yelling, we're Cuban!"""
"&gt; Based on what you said, she sounds like she was REALLY good at acting. If a friend breaks down crying in front of our group and told us that he/she was assaulted by someone, in vivid detail, I... honestly would believe them. And in a he said/ she said, the one that acts more believable is believed, and it sounds like she acted really well.

Not to mention, the motive is unimaginably insane. I default towards believing the victim, but I'm obviously aware that there's always the possibility of motives like revenge on an ex or seeking financial gain. Y'know, look at the situation and say ""What would this person have to gain from this?"". But being mad over a ruling in a tabletop gain? I still almost can't believe it. "
"Often, when women set definitive boundaries with men who are aggressively chasing them, the women end up in a bad place: physically or mentally abused, harassed or stalked, fired or reprimanded for 'confrontational behavior' if it's at work.  Some even end up dead.  

Women have to be careful when setting boundaries, and I think it's something many men simply don't understand because they will never experience the fear of the potential consequences like women do.  

In this case, OP sounds like he never gave his GF a chance.  She's being aggressively chased by a guy who played at wanting to be a friend, and then when she figures out he's not a friend and decides not to hang out with him she then gets dumped by the OP because she didn't set boundaries hard enough for OP, no matter than setting those boundaries may have hurt her career or potentially endangered her.

Honestly, the only person who wasn't in the wrong in this thing is OP's ex-GF.  I hope she moves on and find someone who respects her as a person and doesn't see her as some naive child who can't handle her own business. "
"When you start the post with:  'my SO isn't evil""...you may want to totally rethink why you're with this dude."
"I would like to chime in.  This isn't something I would do personally.  But playing devil's advocate.  

First, it was his private journal.  It was meant for him and him only.  Would you want him snooping around your emails, even accidentally?  

Second, what has he done wrong here?  He obviously is sexually attracted to Emily.  I mean by the way you describe her, who wouldn't be.  Does that mean he finds you less attractive?  No, you guys have been together for 3 years.  Sex is good, but probably very predictable.   Instead of lashing out, going on tinder, hitting on girls at a bar, trying to get with Emily; he is expressing his urges through writing.  Fantasy writing!

Does that mean he would want to act on it?  If anything it shows he wouldn't, that's why he is writing it out.  How would you feel if your internal thoughts about something you felt guilty about was public for people to hear/read.  Is it wrong for him to find other women sexually attractive? 

Do you not find people you meet attractive, sometimes maybe day dream what if scenarios?  The only issue I see here is that you read something private that shouldn't have been shared.  Whether you can get past it, is up to you.  But don't demonize him or think of him as cheating.  Talk to him, see how he feels about it."
"&gt; He's even admitted to being attracted to her because we somehow wound up on the topic of threesomes and her name came up.

That's not just a red flag.

That's the actual sunken ship."
"Also, be very aware that even been can 'creep up' on you.  You have one and you're feeling fine.  Then you have another and maybe a bit more and suddenly...  You get the idea.

Drink water/soda in between drinks.  Drink any alcoholic beverage slowly.  Don't get sucked into contests etc.  Lie if you have to about how many you've had or 'I've just got a new one' if pressured.  Maybe go for sodas/etc. that can pass as mixed drinks.

Drinking alcohol is a very social activity.  Enjoy it but master it rather than the opposite.  What you do now sets a precedent for how you drink later on.  If people are drinking to get drunk... then they have a problem.  I say this as an Aussie, from a place known for their intake."
"She may not even be consciously aware of it, it could just be a knee-jerk 'no'. It could also be that she has some sexist ideas in terms of who is most likely to cause a relationship to break down. The two of you sitting her down to talk about this might be a good idea, with or without a neutral fourth party. "
"The constant denial is the weirdest thing, imo. All of this is harmless (well, the foot thing affects her, too), but why would he get so agitated?"
"Female BJJ purple belt here. I've been doing jiu-jitsu for five years, and I WISH I'd gotten into it at your age. I started after nearly getting raped, and it's now my whole life. It upsets me that your parents claim to be progressive, but are stopping you from partaking in such a great sport. As far as sports go, it doesn't get any more ""gender-equal"" than jiu-jitsu. Someone small and ""weak"" can overpower a larger, stronger opponent using technique. You build amazing friendships with both men and women. You learn to value your body for what it can do rather than what it looks like (something I think a lot of people, but especially teenagers could benefit from). 

Feel free to PM me with any questions. I'm happy to help out in any way I can. "
"ehhhhhh my boyfriend has done a ton of different martial arts, and he's been doing BJJ for many years. According to him it all comes down to the culture of your gym. He used to go to a more expensive gym and he said the atmosphere there was very friendly and egalitarian, there are lots of women who train there and they seem comfortable. Now he's at a different cheaper gym and the toxic masculinity is totally palpable, he tells stories of guys coming in and saying really rude shit about women, weird levels of competition between the guys. Just a general air of bro-fitness, he's not a fan. "

"Okay. So out of all the people in the world, yours is the only behavior with which he takes issue.

I don't know why you'd want to be with someone who so obviously thinks you suck. I'm sorry, I know it's harsh, but you need to realize what an asshole he's being. Maybe you should suggest to him that he find a girlfriend whose behavior he doesn't constantly need to correct like a child."
I'm not sure your point.  You seem to be arguing against a point I didn't make.
"One of my brothers is an MP.  They are trained to  be professional and impersonal about their job.  He's detached emotionally and doing his 9-5.

I've been sexually assaulted and yes, it sucks.  I understand the ways it can mess with your life in all areas.  

You, as a survivor, have an understandable aversion to the inmate.  

However, your hubby probably doesn't have the freedom to choose which inmate he's escorting. Is your husband in danger? Would his command put him in a situation he wasn't prepared for?  The military has protocol for...everything.  There are checks and balances. Soldiers are trained to do what they're ordered. Hubby dealing with scumbags is part of his job everyday.  (I have to accept that when my brother puts on his MP uniform that he's a police officer.  His job trumps my fear for his safety.)

By bringing this issue up it shows that something is troubling you and you need to pay attention to it.  But it's your issue.  You need to speak with your therapist / counselor about your own trauma.  This needs to be dealt with in the context of mental health.  

Edit  - I've been in therapy at different times. It's immensely helpful."
"Things happen. Holding a grudge against someone for interacting with *other family members* is ridiculous. Yes Alice fucked up but it was years ago, and now Kelly is prolonging the issue when it doesn't even need to be an issue anymore. She could let it go, and instead she's choosing to make Alice's problems all about **her**. 

Why can't you just reach out to Alice and then **not** tell Kelly about it? Why is Kelly even involved in your decisions about who you speak to? 

If Kelly wants to cut you off for speaking to someone, that's her own damn fault. I would go right ahead and speak with Alice, and let Kelly explain how she's cutting people off for daring to go against her orders. I don't understand why you are catering to her at all. "

"The job is not meant to be a living wage. It's meant to be a sort of 1 year internship for people who just graduated. I'm doing it year after year because my boyfriend won't get a domestic partnership with me so I have no other options. I'm literally only still here because of him. If it weren't for him, I'd be in the US surely with a Master's degree and a real job by now. "
"I wouldn't mention that you know your boyfriend's pay, OP. Managers HATE their employees discussing pay, and while it's illegal to fire you for it, it may lead to trouble down the road. Just say that you would like a raise because of the responsibilities. "
I would do an experiment and keep picking Ramen bar and see how long it takes for her to crack. For science.
"Thanks for your thoughts. I'll admit my motive for posting this... it was my husband pushing for the idea and I felt it would be weird or rude. I didn't have a clue which of us was more in-line with the norm, but I'll push harder for my position after the feedback here."
"Oh man. Going to therapy on her own, with no prompting from you...that's a huge green flag. Like the opposite of a red flag. Giving you space after what happened is another green flag. She seems like she genuinely gets it. That's huge. I'm happy for you."
"Well, if she really wants to invest in this cottage, I'd tell her to go right ahead, but it's her name on the loan, it will be her money used.

"This is prioritising your new partner over your child.  I am a lot less precious than many on this sub - I introduced my son to my now husband (in a sensitive way) after only three months, but that was some years after I split from his father.  

The situation you have created is one that you and John chose, and your daughter didn't.  The fact that the two of you are presenting a united front against her on this issue, when it should be you listening to and supporting her, and John sucking it the hell up, is really worrying.  Step-parenting is hard.  I have step-kids.  Whilst it is necessary for adults in the house to have a certain degree of authority, relationships between adults and children should be led by the children.  They did not choose them.  Let her protect her feelings as she feels she needs to, even if it might come across as rude.  Let John handle his own ego.  As others have suggested, counselling could be a good option - in my view, if that happens, you need to make it really clear to her that unless she is in danger, that will be confidential to her and the counsellor, so that she has safe space to talk about things that involve you without worrying that your feelings will be hurt.  I hope this isn't too harsh, but I have learned it the hard way (this is my second step-parenting gig, and holy hell have I done it better this time around).  "
"Yeah, it doesn't sound like OP was terribly rude or anything either.  Ideally it would have gone ""hm, hey OPs boyfriend can I sit in your lap for a second?"" and then OP could have maybe sat in her boyfriends lap instead to make room on the couch.  Sounds like this woman doesn't have a good grasp of the social dynamics here, because while some people would have no problem with her actions clearly OP does.  "

"I think a responsible adult knows that 17 year olds are likely to experiment with alcohol, and that discouraging doesn't stop people from doing things. It certainly doesn't stop 17 year olds from doing things.

"Your wife is acting a little nutty. It’s great that she thinks that you are important and good to her daughter.

"I also do not believe you are overreacting, not one bit. But even if you were overreacting in someone's eyes, you're entitled. You are dating. you're not married. you don't have kids together. you're entitled to stop dating him for any reason whatsoever. There's no bureaucracy that you need to apply to for permission to end the relationship. You could stop dating him because you can't stand to listen to his weird laugh one more time. But in this case, he's 34, and he thinks it's okay to be insulting and rude, and he doubled down on it when you called him out. He evidently takes his dad as a role model. You might point out to him that his parents' marriage ended in divorce so if he wants to ever be in a lastng relationship, he shouldn't act like his dad."

"She was lashing out because she was incredibly insecure in that environment. Her way of hiding how insecure she was was to say that she hated everything and be super picky. I'm sure her behavior took her by surprise and she is very embarrassed with herself.

No, I don't think you do respect marriage. You know why? Because it's based on commitment. Your coworker already has a committed relationship.

So after your hope that you could sway your wife despite her very clearly stated boundaries, you’re going too...try and sway your wife despite her clearly stated boundaries. 

Why not set up a marital appointment. Go into this with the intention of for a solution to the problem that is good for the whole family, not with the intention of convincing your wife to do things your way.

"Do you think it’s true that I’m chronically single because I’m ugly?

Pretty much? 

I hate to sound harsh, but the reality is that your appearance does play a major factor in relationships. How can someone know your funny if there put off ever approaching you at all?

This doesn't mean there aren't guys out there who wouldn't be fine with it. In my opinion it just means you have a much smaller pool to be work with. 

Everyone seems to think your guy friend was being mean, but it sounds like he was just giving you an honest opinion. As a rule I think having someone in your life with that kind of honesty can be a welcome change from the usual well-meaning but useless platitudes. 
"
"Have you talked to her about this? I mean REALLY talked to her and ask what brought this on? 

in all honesty this may turn into a deal breaker. She's not the woman you married and has impacted your social life. She's allowed to change, but you're also allowed to not want to live with the changed her."
"I feel he didn't really do everything right. He felt drowsy and went to sleep in some chicks house rather than going home. He didn't ask why he had to wait and didn't leave his not-friend's house after completing the help. He indulged her attention seeking/compliment fishing behavior multiple times. Even still in this post he's all ""gee she's so hot with an awesome personality I really don't get why she's single."" He sounds like he has absolutely no boundaries and acts willfully aloof because no adult with relationship experience would ever miss these glaringly obvious signs of 'she's being inappropriate'.  And the fact that he didn't just immediately leave as soon as he saw her, or as soon as she sat on his lap, or as soon as she tried talking him into an affair...wtf. "

"I think you and your therapist need to work on your self-worth, self-love and self-esteem. You're younger than me and I'm not being vain when I say I'm wife-able 😊. My boyfriend is older than me again and divorced, and he's a hella catch. One of my friends got married in her 30s. Another got married in her 50s. Then again, you don't have to be married to have a long and happy relationship.

It sounds to me like you literally define yourself in relation to the marriage to your husband. I really think you would benefit from some time away from him, building up. Like a 10 minute walk building up to a coffee with friends for 30 mins, then even an evening out. 

It really sounds like you have undiagnosed OCD or a similar compulsion disorder where you believe something awful will happen if you're not there. I knew a guy who was convinced his uncle would die unless he did this 'ritual' (touching a basketball hoop, doing certain exercises etc. in his back garden, taking up to an hour a day). It's self-fulfilling because the uncle was a healthy man in his 40's, but 'proved' my friend was right. Then my friend got meningitis and was bedbound for a week. No ritual. My friend FREAKED OUT. But his uncle was fine, and still is. Somehow this 'proved' the ritual was just ocd and my friend stopped doing it.

It sounds to me it would do you AND you husband good if you both stopped worrying unnecessarily so much. I don't want to stress you, but there will be a time in one or both of your lives when you will need the other to 'adult up' (pregnancy, unemployment, illness). You'll be apart. You'll need each other FOR REAL, not this anxiety-driven codependancy.

I'm not trying to be harsh - you both sound really sweet. But you need to really commit to working on this anxiety like your husband is a drug and you're in rehab. You need to be able to survive without him, becuase one day he may need you to be strong for him.

P.s. Used to be a trainee therapist, worked a lot with clients with anxiety and abuse survivors."

"You know your BF's history better than us. All I'm saying is that (1) he set forth a series of events that may lead to him cheating on you and (2) he showed no remorse. But maybe this is an isolated incident and he does truly love you. You need to determine that on your own. 

That being said, what he did was deliberate and premeditated. That alone is sufficient cause for me to halt and think real hard whether I want to continue with that relationship. "
"I agree with other comments that someone this socially clueless needs you to be very blunt with them. Your goal here should **not* be to nicely tell people to stop. Your goal here should be to *make them feel bad about doing it and stop doing it*. 


Now, I don't mean make them feel bad in the sense that you're personally insulting them or being cruel or something. I mean make them feel bad in the sense that they're doing something inappropriate, inconsiderate, and rude. When you do inappropriate, inconsiderate, and rude things - you *should* feel a little bad about it. That bad feeling reminds you: hey. don't be a jerk in the future. There was a consequence to being rude, and that consequence was now I feel bad about it. 


If you're currently issuing ""mass"" invitations (emailing several people at once, group text, etc) stop doing that and start issuing invitations individually.


For people who have respected your request in the past, just politely reiterate that you'd prefer they not bring additional guests.


But for everyone who has not respected your request in the past, use a script like:


""Friend, I'm having a Thanksgiving party, but I need to talk to you about something serious. In the past, when I invite you, you bring along extra people even though I tell you not to. This is incredibly inconsiderate and rude. It's very frustrating to me that you're ignoring me, and it's really upsetting that you treat me and my home disrespectfully. I want to invite you to Thanksgiving, but I don't know if I trust you to respect my boundaries. Can you promise me that you won't bring extra people?"" 


A rational person will say something like, ""Wow, I really didn't realize I was being so rude and I'm sorry. I won't do this again.""


A jerk will say something like, ""Lighten up! It was just 2 people! Why are you so stringy and mean and why do you hate people?""


If they act like a jerk, congratulations! You have one less person to worry about, because now you are released from any obligation to ever invite them to anything ever again. "
"This is pretty good, I mean a quick google search could fix the OP's fears pretty easily.

It could be a divorce thing, or it could be some estate thing like he's meeting with a lawyer about inheritance or something else on his side of the family, or anything else. The area of law he practices would be plenty of information."
"My husband and I never touch one another's devices without permission. For us, they are as private property. 

And even I think your boyfriend is being a shady ass with this level of defensiveness and aggression over notifications and history clearing. His desire to keep his phone private isn't the problem, it's the attitude towards you that raises red flags. *Both* of you have attitude issues on this issue and come at the subject with a lack of respect and trust for one another. 

You may be looking at a fundamental incompatibility unless you can both agree to abandon your defensive, distrustful stances over this."
"Classic case of marry in haste, repent at leisure.

I hate, hate, hate men who subscribe to the ""lil miss"" brand of condescension. Ugh."
"&gt; Also, I feel as though getting into bed with someone too early in a relationship is kinda like skipping over the veggies, meat, and potatoes of a meal and going straight for the cake - it tastes good for sure, but it does not satisfy.

I think you have a skewed view on relationships that you're projecting on to other people's relationships. Relationships are not a plate, and sex is not a cake. It's an activity that adults do together for a variety of reasons, usually making a relationship stronger. Looking down on relationships that choose to share this experience earlier than you'd like is condescending. Sex doesn't make other parts of the relationship shallower.

Personally, I couldn't do it (for reasons related to the paragraph above). Sexual compatibility is an important part of a relationship, just like how compatible you are in conversation or how compatible you are living together. I think it's important to get the whole package and understand that you can both take care of each others' needs so you both know more when taking the next steps."
"I think you should ghost her.   Hear me out as to why.

You SIL didn't make a mistake, she made a repeated choice to betray your brother and the marriage.  It wasn't just sex, it was a deliberate choice made by an adult.

That's why it hurts him, and why it hurts you because after you and he and your family had out your love and trust in her, she willingly repeatedly chose to betray and cheat on your brother.  

You are now feeling humiliated and betrayed yourself because you trusted someone who chose to hurt your brother deeply in a way that he will carry with him for the rest of his life.

You are hurting because her betrayal is now hurting your own life and relatiinship.

She had her affair willingly, she did it repeatedly, and each time she made a choice as a full adult to do it.  She's not a good person.

You should ghost her because she's badly hurt your brother, you, your family, and your own relationship with your bf.  If you maintain contact with her she will dump her emotional garbage on you which will hurt you even more.

If you have love and sympathy to share, share it with your brother,  he is the victim here.  You wouldn't reach out to the robber who stole your friends wallet? Why would you reach out to the person who stole your brothers trust and love?
"
"&gt;  I don't expect him to be with me or even care for me no matter what.

Oh, OP, this breaks my heart. But I hope that no matter what happens, this capacity to care for someone and to foster a very beautiful and dear relationship is something that you have and will carry with you even if this relationship ends. This is a quality *you* have, and you can use it again. I'm sending you my absolute best wishes."
"This is not ultimately about keys and locks, really. Of course you should change the locks, because of course she'll have another key, but of course she'll find another way to break in or find another way in to your house. *She went through your laundry to inspect your pajamas for proof of her foregone conclusion that you are cheating on her son.* If your husband has not put that together yet, please lay out those puzzle pieces for him. That goes way beyond boundary-crossing into very creepy stalker behavior."
Are you serious? He's heading towards anorexia because he eats reasonable portion sizes (i.e eats until he is satiated) and chooses healthier options when is makes sense? That is how you're supposed to eat! He doesn't go hungry or overexercise or obsess over food... He simply stops eating when is full. Perfectly fine.

"You both really need to get over this fairly quickly.

These kinds of thought: ""missed opportunities"", will ruin your relationship. The grass is always greener, as they say."
"Yeah, that one part stood out to me too. OP, the girl you were dating was not that great of a person. She slept with your brother for MONTHS. She is ultimately the sort of person who would do that. The person you imagine is still part of reality, but you all have to take into account that is not the whole picture. Most people would NEVER do anything like she did. Whatever positives she had, they cannot make up for that.

You will one day find someone again, and this person will be a better person, a genuinely better person, than the girl that slept with your freaking brother. Hell, it's not hard to beat that, so you're actually going to do a lot better when you move on, it's almost guaranteed. I couldn't give a fiddler's fart about how great a conversationalist she is, how she loves kittens and reads to blind kids while getting her medical degree or WHATEVER, she's still a slimy, gross person. Keep that in mind, and realize that you're family is shitty, so birds of a feather flock together. *Of course* she was attracted to your brother, they're both the sort of crap humans that would pull this, and your family is full of the sort of crap humans who would condone and hide it. Fantastic! They all deserve each other, but you can absolutely do much better. As I said earlier, it would be hard not to....You are blinded perhaps by how you used to see her? But, she's still a really gross person, no matter what other traits she has. You don't have to chase after relationships, but you don't have to closer yourself off forever either. These people don't deserve that sort of power over your life."
"I agree that it sounds very suspicious. It's the kind of defence a 12 year old would make when they get caught doing something they shouldn't.  

On the other hand, he is posting to strangers on the internet using a throwaway account so what real incentive would he have to lie?  

Personally, I think it would be *less* embarrassing for him to just admit that he got blind drunk and in a moment of jealous rage sent those messages himself (and regretted it) rather than try to pass the blame to a friend who got hold of his phone. So I'm a little torn here.   

At this point it doesn't really matter what the truth is. The damage done is irreparable regardless of who sent the messages. He is responsible for his/his friends actions and he will have to take the bullet here.  

"
"Probably because he's listened to OP pine for this woman for three years and go on about the mistake he made?  It doesn't at all excuse his friend's behavior. That was a fucked up and malicious thing to do, but I've had a few friends go through some bad breakups and you do get invested in those people, because you care about them.

I think this warrants one of those "" if you ever pull that shit again..."" talks with his friend. It's not like OP's chances are ruined. She's got a kod with another man and seems to be happy. It was a shitty thing to do, but OP's relationship is more than long over. He also made thr cardinal mistake of looking up an ex he's still ass over tea kettle for. I'm going to take a gamble and say he and his friend were talking about this mostbof the time they were drinking. Drunken friend gets worked uo and thinks ""how the fuck could she do this to such a kind and good man!?"" Then decides in a drunken stupor that using his phone to message her is somehow a good idea and will ""get back at her."" 

All and all, this is a shit show. Op needs to move on. Whether it's a mistake or not, what's done is done. He needs to give his friend a serious talk about boundries and his actions were not acceptable. The guy fucked up, but he didn't ruin a relationship. These two haven't talked for three years. Their lives have moved a part. It's like that song says. It's just someone he used to know.

Also OP remove your ex from fucking facebook. If you can't stop looking her up, delete your facebook foe a while and for fuck sakes, get out and meet some ladies. If you found one good one. You'll find another. You're never going to see the next woman in front of you if yourewtoo busy looking behind."

Don't ever contact him again, ghost and block him everywhere = he will be confused, angry, not know why what's happening is happening, have his fears as outlined through that spreadsheet confirmed and quite possibly be dangerous.

Message him to say you'd seen the spreadsheet and hence it's over due to creepy McCreeperFace behaviour, then ghost and block him everywhere - he will be angry, upset, and quite possibly dangerous.

Unless you have mutual friends (unlikely, because Tinder), I'm not sure why not mentioning the spreadsheet is the way to go - it might be less dangerous than just fleeing without explanation.

"Over time I noticed that, from post history and general attitude, almost 100% of the people who aggressively defend their 'privacy' in this manner are just projecting their feelings over having been caught cheating this way. It's a self-defense mechanism used to feel guilt-free about being a failure of a partner.

The top of my head is also cut off). Of all the pictures they took, only a few are worth printing, and even those aren't truly good photos. They're just the best out of a shitty lot. Not surprisingly, their photography business never really got off the ground and they had several extremely angry brides who left them bad reviews due to quality/overall lack of professionalism. 


My biggest regret isn't going ahead and hiring a proper wedding photographer. I didn't want to risk offending my in-laws and ended up with horrible wedding pictures as a result..and the sad thing is they're the last pictures I have of me with my Mom before she passed away."

Not saying the guy would commit an illegal act but he's certainly being very inappropriate with a young girl - that would ring alarm bells for most people.

@OP I think you should have a chat with your mom if you trust her. Tell her what he's been asking and that it makes you uncomfortable and upset. If I had a daughter and was dating a guy that was asking stuff like this I'd really want her to tell me. No relationship is worth risking the safety of your children.

Put them somewhere safe where your husband can't find them (*not* in the house). Make sure you have enough money for yourself that your husband can't access (if you have a joint account, drain half of it), and take anything valuable and expensive with you. Stay somewhere with someone you feel safe with tonight.

You might notice that this is the advice given to people in an abusive relationship. This is because, whether you recognise it or not, your husband is abusive. Yes, I'm sure his alcoholism is contributing to this behaviour, but it's still abusive behaviour. 

Get out and get safe."
"You don't have to protect people from your past, and you also don't have to bring it up if you don't want to. If you're feeling comfortable with someone and you want to tell them about your previous marriage, that's okay. If you want to tell a story about you ex husband without adding that he died, that's okay too. There's probably no way to bring it up that guarantees that people won't be awkward about it, so I recommend thinking about how you'd like people to respond or if there's anything you can ask for. Like, ""Thanks, I wanted to mention it because it was such a big part of my life, but I don't necessarily want to go all the way into it right now,"" or ""Thanks, I would like to tell you more about it if you're up for it."" "
"OP's husband has also had 3 people in his immediate family die of colon cancer. It's possible he's terrified of hospitals, doctors, etc."
I agree with you. It opens you up to undue criticism. To me it would be like selling out and my integrity is more important than that. 
"I know you think your friends aren't close enough for them to be willing to help you, but you would be surprised at people's generosity and willingness to help. If you're serious about leaving and wanting to make a change, ask around, someone might surprise you. Be sure that you're serious though about leaving, as it's extremely frustrating to get asked for help, be very generous to the person asking, and then have them just go back to the situation you helped them get out of."
"Wow, your dad sounds like a worthless parent.  He is letting your stepmother abuse you, basically. Punishing your sister for nothing (WHY WOULD SHE MOVE OUT IF SHE OWNS THIS PLACE?!), going wayyyy over the line in that punishment, and now she's alienating you from the rest of the family with her lies? This man would have exactly 1 more chance to do what's right before I would cut him off. 

And I definitely think you should go to the police. Your stepmom should not get away with that abuse. She's vile. 

I am so sorry you are going through this. Take care of each other."
"Do you trust and have a good relationship with your mom? You can try talking to her about it. ""I feel uncomfortable around Rick and I would rather find another way to get to school. He asks me questions about what kind of boys I like and whether my best friend is a lesbian and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Sometimes I cry because I'm afraid of him. I respect your right to have a relationship with him but I'd like to minimize my contact with him."" 

You don't need solid proof of anything. You don't have to spend time with someone who makes you uncomfortable for ANY reason. And he has definitely been asking you sexual and inappropriate questions. If your mom tries to invalidate your feelings then talk to another adult you trust--your dad or aunt or a teacher. 

Don't feel embarrassed that you're accusing him of anything or making a big deal out of nothing. You have the right to not want to spend time with someone for any reason, to feel safe and secure and comfortable. "
"The fact that this is how you think to broach the topic speaks volumes. It's very aggressive and presumptuous. Men, hell any people, are not mind readers. There are couples all over this planet that have been together, lived together for years getting divorced because they're pissed off at their partners about things they didn't just talk to them about. This dude has known you for a few weeks and lives an hour away."
You don't deserve this but it says the truth about this guy. He wants to have sex and that's why he's asking. Like someone else said he doesn't care about your needs. 
You're a great person OP.
"Completely agree with everything said here. How your SO handles stress is EVERYTHING. Your new wife could have invited you into what she was feeling, said she was heartbroken about the photos, and worked with you to resolve this disappointment. 

Obviously the fact you had the privilege to get married was the most important part of that day, and of course the poor photographs were not your fault. Really, I understand the disappointment, but some people would kill to find a SO to marry or just to have their love recognized; in a way who CARES about photos?! 

I'm so glad you suggested taking the photos again. Of course it's not exactly the same, but in a way those photos would be even more beautiful. They would symbolize how you overcome disappointments together and rise on top, and reinforce why you got married in the first place. Hell, it could be for your 1st year anniversary, even invite the same guests to pose in the photos with you and then use it as an excuse to have a party afterwards haha! 

This who scenario with you SO sucks, I'm sorry you're experiencing this, but I would see it as an opportunity. Puffyface83 is right in that people would rightfully be reevaluating their relationships over this, because how she handled (or rather didn't handle) this situation, which isn't an actually seriously stressful situation in comparison to a lot of others, is worrisome. Who knows what the future holds? Is she going to be your equal by your side in those moments, or is she going to add to the problem? 

You need to have a calm, loving, two-sided discussion specifically about this. This is a great opportunity for you to either grow and bring out the best in each other as a couple, or for you to realise now sooner rather than later in time for you to consider what you truly want for the rest of your days. 

Good luck x"
"In the past year and three months, how often have you felt uncomfortable about her friendships or activities that involve others guys? Is it just with exes, or all guys in general?

From your other comment, it sounds like this has a lot more to do with your history of having exes cheat on you than it does with her relationship with this guy. And this is an online book club - this doesn't even set up the potential for her to cheat any more than her current relationship to him."
"You two need to figure out a way to reduce friction over splitting expenses.  Nickel-and-diming each other or feeling like the other person is stingy is a way to build a lot of resentment into the relationship.  

It does matter in this discussion that he spent thousands on your engagement ring.  I think you two should put all wedding related expenses (including the ring, including hair and make-up for your mom, all of it) into the spreadsheet and then split that number.  Or you should probably stick to the agreement you already made with gendered expenses where he pays for the man stuff and you pay for the woman stuff. 

If he makes more money than you, then he probably should be paying more than half of shared expenses.  But that is probably an agreement that you’d make going forward, not something to try to spring on him retroactively.  

There are a lot of different ways for a couple to handle finances. There isn’t an objective right or wrong - you have to find a system you can both be satisfied with.  You generally shouldn’t try to change agreements retroactively. You two should treat this as a test-case for how you’re going to work through financial disagreements going forward, and work to build a solid framework for resolving these matters.  "
"I'm a stone's throw from 30 so I'm still much younger than your boyfriend. Having said that, I couldn't be in a relationship with someone your age. You seem to be rather intelligent but you just aren't in the same place that I am. I work around a lot of kids your age and while I think some of them are pretty cool, I wouldn't even spend a serious amount of time with them as friends. Their interests, hobbies, concerns, etc. are so far removed from my world and their thought process and behavior is foreign to me, sometimes outright exhausting. And I say this of the smarter ones; I'm just not a teenager anymore. What you grew up with, the world you live in, is drastically different from mine. Entire concepts that you've grown to lean on didn't exist when I was 18. His world was even *more* different from yours than mine was. And yes, I believe that shapes a person, the environment and cultural climate you grew up in.

Note that my grandmother was 11 years younger than my grandfather, so I'm not saying all age gaps are bad. This one is just rather large and ultimately leads nowhere or to you, at 30, taking care of your 59 year old husband. Aging is rough business, I wouldn't recommend to anyone that they rush into that life, forgoing their youth.

How do you intend to build him into your life? Would your college friends be okay with hanging out with a nearly 50 year old man? Would he want to hang out with them? Sharing friend circles, hobbies, experiences, life goals, etc. is a major part of a relationship.

Edited to add: /u/idked, you later wrote, ""I've essentially been conditioned to think that my sole purpose in life is to please older men"" But you didn't explain what that meant and I think it's interesting that by just 18 years of age, hell even younger, you felt you were particularly ""conditioned"" to please older men. Were you traumatized somehow as a child? Because this is otherwise a rather dramatic way to view what I can only interpret as ""conditioned to please older men because your male teachers, father, and male family members are inherently older"". We all, both young girls and boys, find ourselves needing to follow the direction of older folks, again both male and female. For you to have somehow formed the conclusion that you are ornamental in a man's life is a very abnormal and unhealthy reaction. I know that you initially began the thread by insisting nothing nefarious is going on, but I think that's because you aren't fully understanding just how damaged that sort of mindset is; and that you acknowledge this is a major component of why your bf likes you. Your therapist either didn't pick up on it because you didn't say this or she's terrible at her job."
"Well, you should have told her then that you weren't okay with it. But now what's done is done. 

My best suggestion is to ask her brother, who is this guy's friend, to keep a close eye on him."
"99% of men as well. Everyone I've dated has been unfussed either way and not minded if I've gone nuts on bold lips &amp; eyeliner for a while or worn nothing, because it's not up to them what I'm allowed to wear.  Huge red flag for OP that her boyfriend thinks he can dictate how she looks (doubly so since it's while taking no care of himself to the detriment of his career)."
"Yup. Dude got a new woman lined up, right now he's getting the story right so he looks good(painting you as a jealous cheater either means he can easily end it justified, or it can justify him cheating on you, or if you break up due to the lies he can say he totally tried, but you just didn't care anymore).  If he hasn't cheated yet, he will either do so or break up within the next few days, at the latest when he's 100% his new chick works out.

Usually I hate this whole ""Break up, he cheated"" spiel in this sub, but dude's straight-up going scorched earth while still in a relationship with you. Usually the super obvious lies to friends come after the break-up, not before."
"&gt; I am going to act professionally and try to talk to him about it at a later date.

you can either 1) act professionally or 2) talk to him about it at a later date. 

Talking to him about it at a later date would be the definition of ""unprofessional""

Also, I don't think you understood how harshly I was criticizing you by saying ""act professionally"", which is probably part of the problem."
"Your boyfriend sounds like a jerk.  But honestly, this:

&gt;I'm the kind of person my friends know as ""telling it like it is"", I apply this to all my relationships and friendships. I'm open about my wants and needs always and if I feel disrespected I will say so.

Is a massive red flag as well.  ""Telling it like it is"" *isn't* always a good thing - it usually means that you have no filter on your mouth, and you rarely stop and think about what you say, despite your assurance to the contrary.

It's like someone who believes in brutal honesty - where the brutality is as important as the honesty.

It's up there with people who use ""If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best"".

So yes... your boyfriend sounds like a jerk.  But maybe he has a point."
"I wonder what kind of legal trouble it is. There is an off chance that he is looking for ways to minimize your exposure to his liability, ehich would be part of why he wouldn't want to give you details. Let's call this the best case scenario. 

However, you need to question what you know about this legal trouble. Yes, sometimes people get into bad situations that aren't their fault--a perusal of /r/legaladvice show that sometimes, troubke does come looking for a person. However, ask.yourself how much you actually know about this situation independent of what he has told you. Do searches online about arrests, charges, and convictions ubder his name. Look up court records pertsinibg yo this case. 

The $1,000,000 question--is there anything about this or any other legal trouble that speaks poorly of his character? Has he been secretive or exploitative in any other ways that you have witnessed? 

On the down low, collect everything you can find about both of your assets and debts. Are you aware of all of them? Are there any accounts, investments, or debts that you are not aware of? Do a credit check on both of you and see if there are any surprises. Collect all of this information in a safe place, with account names and numbers, institutions, and most recent balances. Then keep this list going with updates (but don't erase the prebious balances either). In the event of a surprise divorce, you will need this information anyway. Best to accumulate it at leisure. 

Take a hard look at your own life situation. In the event that you were suddenly cut off from your assets, how would you survive? What is your personal income? What are your debts? Do your have a job? What are your job prospects? Who can you rely upon in case of emergency? 

Have your own consult or two with lawyers. Scope out who you would want to work with in case the worst happened. 

Finally, try once more to have an open, honest conversation with Tanner. Let him know that you are willing to work on the relationship and that the papers scared you. If he has any concern that the two of you need to work on, you are ready to do so. 

After that, your choices are: if the legal trouble passes and everything is fine, he should come clean. 

If he keeps being secretive and you really can't trust him, let him know that this is a make or break issue. "
"Most everything. My current relationship is about 6 months in, but we've settled into a comfortable and content routine. 

He's also a SUPER introvert, and I try to let him have his space and not to stay over his house too often or leave my things there (I don't want him to think I'm taking over and make him uncomfortable) but this week he suggested I start leaving some pjs and toiletries since I'm there so often. *Swoon*"
"&gt;he said he would want a divorce and this could break us.

He also understands that you having the abortion will almost certainly lead to the relationship crumbling and you leaving him too right? Like it's a awful choice but he realizes it works both ways correct?

Cause right now he seems really focused on himself, his wants his feelings his threats."
"Dude it would be nice to attend the proposal if you lived there, but flying out? No way. Totally unnecessary expense."
"I think this is the best idea. Google ""David Beckham superstitions"" if you want a good giggle over some of the stuff that super-level sports stars get up to.

Surgeons have spent *decades* **having to be perfect** in order to be surgeons in the first place. I suspect that he vehemently denies anything that makes him less than perfect in his own eyes. Added to the general superstitiousness of world-class performers (and I DO think there's an element of OCD in this - but its being channelled) and you have a perfect storm of odd behaviour which he refuses to admit.

Its kind of sweet :) But annoying :) "
"&gt;My girlfriend was hanging out with friends Friday night. I texted her and she didn’t respond, so I figured they had already met up. Saturday comes around and I was waiting for a response of some sort while at work. At 8pm I asked if she was alright, to which she pointed out that it took until then to contact her. I thought she was still with her friends. She was hurt that I didn’t say good morning, hello, or anything else. I apologized and told her that I understand how she felt and that I should have dropped in because I would have liked it, too. She told me to stop talking to her and when I told her I wasn’t going to let it fester, she told me to f*** off. I apologized again for the mishap and went to bed. Her response was that me going to bed and not settling the issue was proof that I don’t love her. That dropping her like that hurt me.

I nearly stopped reading here. I tried to keep reading, but the entire post never seemed to get much better. She sounds incredibly manipulative *at best* - someone who gets off on hearing you beg for her forgiveness. The way she morphed into the victim, taking your groveling for her love as ""abuse"" was just... ugh. You dodged a bullet, man. "
Yep some people will bend over backwards to pretend everything is fine so they can avoid taking any responsibility for contributing to this situation in the first place. 
"I think buying your own kitchen stuff is bad advice. Who needs another set of cutlery? If there's anything they're missing, sure, but buying your unnecessary stuff for the sake of presence is going to annoy them and eat up more space."
One of the number one indicators of being underweight is irregular or nonexistent menstruation. The body literally cannot expend the energy required for menstruation (very energy intensive). It's basically your body going into survival mode. 
My young cousins have a playroom that's also the guest room and they are NEVER in there. It's full of piles of toys but they are always in their bedroom or in the living room w/ the adults.
I think you need to encourage her to see a doctor. There is a good chance she has PPD especially considering the circumstances of the birth being such a shock. 
"We don't really have a whole lot of guests over since we are in the middle of updating. I really appreciate that you sound like a voice of reason, but it happens infrequently enough to raise an eyebrow. The only dude that would have been at my house is my brother, and he's...big so it's a no go on the jacket. 

I haven't had anyone over to the house since we got it except my mom and my brother, and I don't remember him wearing it ever since it's just not his style at all. He wasn't wearing it at the airport when I picked him up, but I don't remember him having it in his hands either. And it was on top of a pile of his clothes, so it's just an odd situation.

If it happened the other way around I'd be concerned, and I'd believe him if he said he didn't know where it came from but I'd still have a concern in the back of my head, no doubt, just because it's odd and doesn't really add up. So I'm just trying to be empathetic here.

"
"5 pounds doesn't even make sense. My scale can fluctuate that much on the daily based on when I eat and poop and weigh myself.

While I'd be tempted to do it just for the free stuff, I agree that you're right in the sense that it would just open up more controlling things.

 My compromise: challenge her to a physical activity, and beat her so she knows a difference in five fucking pounds doesn't mean Jack all when it comes to health. "
"&gt;But you just got a phone call at 1.30AM about your sick father and then sat on the bed crying. If he couldn't figure out that you needed support, he's oblivious to the point of callousness. 

I’ve known some people who repress all their negative emotions like OP describes, and to be honest, my experience is that those people tend to get defensive and lash out if you overstep when they’re distressed. So, if someone has shown me on multiple occasions in the past that they strongly prefer to self soothe, I would not assume they suddenly wanted to change that unless they either asked outright or initiated physical contact. It’s a shitty situation, but if you train everyone to keep their distance you when you’re upset, you can’t expect them to know just realize when you want them to ignore that training."
"What if he already has previous with the police? Or for talkings sake, what if the guy has mental health problems? OP won't know how much the police can do until she speaks to them. The police can reccomend ways to keep yourself safe and maybe ways to catch the guy out etc. They don't need to speak to him directly at this point."
"Yes, I have my own accounts.  And we are in the middle of an investigation from the thumb incident, so I have some resources.  I asked her school to help with it too.

I'm sorry you were blamed.  I don't think I would blame them, but I would be lying if I said I didn't stay for them.  So many people say they deserve to have their father around, but I'm worried he'll turn on them when they're older."
Came here to suggest this. I'm an EMT and this is my go-to. 
"&gt; This is such an immature worldview.

Saying it doesn’t make it so, Flying Monkey.

&gt; Your parents obviously failed you...

Nope.  My parents, while not perfect, were very good.

The parents of hundreds upon hundreds of other Redditors, however, are a very different story.  I was speaking for (and standing up for) those poor souls.

&gt; but I clearly said “Unless you have a bad relationship with your family”

Whitewash.

When you start out with a statement that’s often used to argue “family can do no wrong”, hedging that with a lukewarm declaration of “except in rare cases where bad relationships exist”.

Relationships with biological family, are always, ALWAYS expendable.  No qualifications, full stop, end of story."
"Please tell her, and don't cover for your brother because his behavior is equally disgusting. "
"Honestly, he probably hasn't put any thought into it. And if he has, then yes, he will be expecting that out of you. I mean, you guys are looking at 3 bedrooms so *you* can have a place to sleep when she's there. Not so you can have a guest room, office, or game room. So *you* can sleep somewhere *else.*

He can tell you no because you won't have a meltdown. He can't tell his daughter no, because she will. He doesn't want to be the ""bad guy"" to her, especially because he and his daughter's mother aren't together. 

I think a twin sized air mattress would be best to accommodate everybody in this situation. Given he's open to it, of course. If not, I'd rethink moving in together."
You are crazy - but because you keep having sex with this guy
"You're being unreasonable, hands down."
"&gt;she didn't have time to point out everything we did right (we should've known we're doing it well!) but she said she found it important to correct us. I guess that makes sense?

Hold up. It makes sense to shame you for being fat when you weren't? It makes sense to shame you for wearing *glasses*? It makes sense to shame you for getting a B once in a while? 

No, none of that makes sense, nor does her explanation. The only thing that makes sense is that your mother was *abusive*.

&gt;We got married and whatever money we got from friends and relatives my mom instantly took half of it because ""she needs it for renovating her house (from hurricane damage) and as her daughter, I should understand. Of course, she'll give it back!"" 

Your mother stole your wedding money that was meant to start your new life.

&gt;so they asked me to borrow my car. I gave it to them. FOR OVER A YEAR.

They didn't borrow your car. They stole it from you.

&gt; One time I asked to borrow the car to visit a friend out of state they kept calling me periodically that weekend telling me how ""selfish"" I'm being.

And abused you for the privilege.

&gt;They asked me for 25K so they could hire a good lawyer and save their business. Yeah... that didn't work out. I also had about 20K saved up in an account from when I worked while I was a teenager, which was under their names. I asked for the money and mom pretended I took it and that I don't remember spending it.

They stole more from you.

Listen OP, it sounds like you are finally waking up to the fact that your parents are asshole losers that are using you every chance they get. They keep your self-esteem low so that they can control you and will squeeze every bit of life and cash out of you if you let them.

What you need to do is go low contact. Never give them money again. Grey rock them. Do not give them any information about your life or finances. Make sure they have no idea where you keep your savings, car or how much you have. 

Do not accept abuse from them. If they abuse you, leave/hang up the phone. That thing where your mom was yelling you about being blind? That would have been a good time to call out unacceptable behavior and leave. These little boundaries will add up over time.

And most, MOST importantly, you need to see a therapist. A lifetime of this kind of abuse wears you down insidiously so that you don't even know what is normal anymore. You feel obligation to these abusers because they have conditioned you that is the only safe way to feel. You need to get help to break that cycle."
"&gt;We will be keeping separate bank accounts after marriage and will have a joint savings/checking account to save for a home as well as pay off all monthly bills. Separate vacations, car payments, and ""fun stuff"" will come out of our individual bank accounts. 

So since you're going this route, I do think that things like dress and makeup should not be included.  However, that also means his tux and shoes should come out of only his pocket.  Either you both include things like dresses and tuxes, or neither of you do.  It's definitely not fair for you to split the cost of his outfit whereas he doesn't help with your outfit.  "

Oh your *wife* is suffering? Jesus Christ.

Tell her to back the fuck off. You should be shutting this down.

Bad enough that your daughter had to live through an abusive daddy, but now daddy's new wife is sticking her nose in and blaming her.

Your daughter should be running in the opposite direction of both of you, at full speed. "
Going off of BC without telling your partner is really fucked up and he had every right to be mad. Seriously. What the fuck.
It definitely is bizarre. I don't know any grown men that get in fights ever. It is not normal.
"Just want to point out that these shows are highly manipulative of their contestants. If your girlfriend says “she doesn’t know what she has outside” that could be because the producers are persuading her that you don’t really care about her.

"I don't think the two dads thing is all that weird. My half siblings call both their bio father and stepfather dad, and that's never been a problem.

"That's not true! They're in school there. They want degrees, they have parents (likely paying) who want them to finish... they are *not* going to flee the country. And then they may never be able to go to the USA again. You have more power here than you think.

The reason they're fucking you over is cause you're the only one on the bill. Do you know how to contact their parents? Assuming they're not also assholes, I'd send a sob story about how you need the money, and hopefully they'll yell at their dumb kids."
I'd never consider it rude to order dessert even if there's a queue. The place is obviously full but they decide to wait anyway. I understand the wait staff wants to make more money but that's not my problem. I'm not gonna cut my eating out experience in half because other people decided to wait.

"He's being a total asshole. I think all that's left is sitting him down and telling him that you are a grown adult who has been living on her own for 8 years and he needs to stop. This he is being condescending and mean for really no reason. If he can't stop after that, dump him. Because seriously, he really is being a total asshole."
"You could respond and tell her that you're interested in getting to know her, but that since she's a minor you can't do that without some involvement from her parents. Suggest that you'd be happy if she reaches out to you again when she turns 18 and you can have a relationship with her that doesn't involve her parents. "
"LOL.

I hate to break it to you, OP, but reading things that someone has posted on the internet is not spying in any way.  Those are the things your SO *chose* to present to represent himself, you can't blame people for basing their judgments of him on that."
"You need to leave him and get a divorce! And yes take the dog with you. This is very abusive behavior that he could be arrested for if you wanted to. He will act sorry after the fact, but then after you forgive him he will do it again. There is no justification for him to hurt you like that. Even if you called his daughter the worst name you could think of.

Also, the abuse will get worse. He has now set the standard for how he thinks he can treat you, and it will get worse instead of better. I imagine he has done other things in the past like throw something, or hit something near you to scare you, and now his behavior has escalated. Please don’t think he will get better, you deserve someone who respects you."
"I don't think it was a deliberate mind game. /u/kinda_outta_luck I know it's hard to directly ask for support, especially given your anxiety over being perceived as a burden, but in the future, ""HEY COMFORT ME PLS"" is probably the correct way to go about this.

That said, it doesn't excuse your fiancé's attitude once he knew you wanted (needed?) his support. He was dismissive and critical of you and your feelings. I assume since he's your fiancé he knows how hard it is for you to get past feeling like a burden? Yet his reaction only reinforces that fear. When you're more calm, it's a good idea to talk about that. If he continues to be dismissive, think about whether or not his attitude is a deal breaker for you."
She’s just not that into you. Time for your high school relationship to end. Sucks and I’m sorry but it’s your only choice.

I'm not bothered by her saying she's ugly, but I am a little worried that she sees herself having a very plain, uninteresting personality too. That's a bit unusual, no? Maybe she is a very rational and objective person.... that does tend to upset regular people and doesn't translate well over the internet.

Keeping this from your girlfriend is super duper not okay
Jesus christ.  You're wife is acting like a fucking child
"I like this. I also think it would be fun to just passive aggressively point out their hypocrisy (although I realize probably not productive). Like when the dad says the gym is useless, turn to the brother and ask about his new gym routine again. Or when they rip on her abput the university, be like oh brother what year did you graduate from there again? But that's just me  and im a dick who cannot put with hypocrisy like this. I could not not point out how illogical and crazy they were. I would go early want to point out their behaviours and interview them. Like wtf how are they so delusional?!?!"
"You need therapy, stat. There are so many red flags in your post that most of the money that you're bringing into the relationship must be a reenactor as a Soviet era flag twirled.

You're controll8ng. You're issuing ultimatums. Your husband had the tenacity and the gall to make his own friends and actually control somethong in his own life and that is driving you crazy. How dare he go independently interact with someone without being granted your input on the situation? His relationship sounds completely innocuous, and of /r/relationships is universally against you in this situation and DOESN'T see infidelity, then congratulations because you just became the needle in the haystack. Seriously, go to therapy. Learn how to give up control and to make your partner your partner, and not just your insemination slave."
"&gt; The reason he gets violent sometimes is because he plays soccer all the time, and as such, he frequently gets in physical scuffles while playing. So, he impulsively gets violent and regrets it the next instant. He says that he can't help it, howsoever hard he tries.

Obviously this is a bullshit explanation.

Your sister should not be with this guy. The trick is going to be telling her that in such a way that it still leaves the door open for her to come to you for help when she finally decides to leave him, which will probably be years from now if it happens at all. 

Since she asked for your opinion, tell her that you think he's dangerous and she shouldn't marry him. She will almost certainly get defensive and make excuses for him. From then on you will have to try not to tell her what to do while at the same time not condoning the excuses she will make for his behavior."
If three months isn't enough to save up for rent then they can't afford rent in that area.
"It's not going to pass. He's jealous and controlling. He treated you like a princess. That's how he ropes you in. Now he's going to treat you like a possession.

All these people he says are the cause of his new jealousy and control? They're all married. You two are not. You've known him all of six months. He's using other people's situations as a justification for his own behavior. 

People get divorced all the time. People cheat on each other all the time. None of that has anything to do with your relationship with him. But he's going to use it as a way to control you. He's already doing it in subtle ways. Commenting on your choice of outfits. Getting upset when you say someone else is cute. It's something he will do slowly, over time, and you'll keep excusing it away because he treated you like a princess once. Before you know it, he'll be controlling your every move, your every interaction, and you'll have no idea how it happened. Then you'll be trapped. 

Drop him before he takes over your life. Do it now. The longer you wait, the more insane his reaction will be over losing control over you.

He'll try everything to get you back. Pleading. Threatening suicide. Threatening or using violence. Harassing you. Trying to be the sweetest guy on the planet. Don't fall for it. Drop him, and if he starts giving you a hard time, report him to his commander."
I just want to say the fact that your parking passes are free is amazing. My university charged $400+ for a semester of parking.
"Your brother is about to learn that a taxi or hire car to the airport will add up to way more than $55 over the next few years, once he can no longer use yours. What an asshole he is. What an *idiot* he is.  

But I wonder WHY he felt it necessary to remove it in the first place? There is some weird story missing here, OP."
"&gt;and tells me I have to help her get friends of her own.

This makes 0 sense. How in the hell are you supposed to make friends for her and have them not be in any way your friends? She is a grown ass adult, it is her responsibility to make friends. It kind of sounds like she waited until you two moved in together to show you her true colors. It sounds like she doesn't want a partner but rather someone to care of her.

You need to tell her that you're not putting up with her behavior anymore. You are, currently, dating a child and if she refuses to get help or seriously work on changing her mindset then you need to leave.

"
"Well, obviously he was able to get with a 22-year-old. That's not the point. He's still likely to be emotionally stunted and controlling, which is the issue here."
"Dude, staying in a relationship because you're worried about someone is ridiculous and never works in long run. And if you're staying because you're worried she will fall apart you, you'reprobably overestimating your importance to get

"I'm not saying you can't be right, but like OP, I was heavier and lost a not-insignificant amount of weight. Right now I'm stress eating a little back on, but I'm nowhere near my heaviest. I'm also a lifelong vegetarian and I've been vegan for almost 4 years now.

My friends, however, are almost all objectively large people/not usually prioritizing healthy eating, and almost none of them are vegetarian. I want to make it clear from jump that I don't care about their food choices, their weights, whatever. I don't go around pushing any of my choices on anyone else; even if someone asks me why I am vegan/says ""but dairy products don't hurt animals!"", I usually defer to ""aw, I don't want to ruin your meal.""

But especially when I first started eating healthier and lessening my portion sizes, I got a LOT of pushback. Even now, I still get comments about what I eat/why I'm not eating more/why I'm choosing ""healthy"" snacks, and I'm 20 pounds up from my lowest weight (which was still on the higher end of a healthy BMI). My friends have mostly accepted now that I eat what, how, and how much I want to eat; it also helps that I generally splurge if I'm with them, and I'm roughly 2-3x more active than they are so I can eat a decent amount considering everything. Now it's more co-workers who make comments.

The fact is, most people don't know what healthy eating looks like for them (a diet that is healthy for me would literally kill a Type 1 diabetic friend, for example, so I'm not saying one diet fits all), they don't know what it takes to maintain a lower weight, and they usually don't have a realistic perception of portion sizes. 

To me, it sounds a lot more like OP has resentful friends, especially his wife, than anorexia or orthorexia. But it's possible, I suppose.

"
"Your entire story is passive.  You have zero say in your own life.  You need to change that first.

You cannot stay with your friends...as a social worker, let me assure you that people can mean well and still mess up other people.  Badly.  They may be doing this out of love but they are trying to fix brain chemicals and trauma with an Oprah book.  If they demand you stay there, tell them they are pushing you too hard.  You literally have an ES dog BECAUSE YOU NEED IT!  Living without the dog alone means this is not an appropriate place for you.

But it does sound like EVERYTHING they say about your grandparents is right.  Sooo....find a half way point.  If you have been diagnosed with BPD that means you qualify for supportive housing options.  Get yourself on the wait list (because I KNOW there is one) of any subsidized mental health housing programs in your area.  Heck, outside of area too.  People with MI qualify for something called Housing Access or Relocation Services which is like a social worker crossed with a real estate agent to help you find housing.  And that service is FREE.

Then when you are on the top of the wait list, you can slowly plan your own move out to YOUR space with YOUR choices.  It has been proven that Person Centered Planning is much more successful than shoving people around and telling them to be healthy.  Seriously...I had a whole class about it in college.  Good luck!"
"&gt;  It was the best possible thing you could have done, as it has lead to you being in a position to help both yourself and your brother. Leaving that toxic environment was the right thing to do.

You know how those airline safety announcements always say ""Make sure that your own oxygen mask is on securely before helping anyone else with their mask."" This rule applies even when the ""anyone else"" is a small, helpless child. 

OP is feeling guilty because he made a ""selfish"" decision, but it was still 100% the right thing to do. "
"Open up a new account at a NEW bank to have your money transferred into. This is critical. You don’t want her to be able to talk her way into accessing that account, which is depressingly easy. 

I don’t think you need to cut everyone off, just those who don’t support you getting out of an abusive relationship. Find the people who are truly supportive of you and lean on them during this difficult time. "
You're a 33 year-old grown adult. Why have you been lying about smoking weed for three months? 
"Talk to your husband, because although it's important you stand up for your own boundaries, you also need him to back you up.

Continue to turn your face. And if FIL gives you any shit about it, and he will, you say ""No. I don't want to be kissed on the lips. Don't do that anymore."" Don't say 'pretty please', because you are not asking for an extra special favor. You are asking for pretty basic respect for a boundary your FIL is trying hard to ignore. 

Practice it in the mirror beforehand, so your voice is calm and firm."
"You’ve told them that it makes you uncomfortable and they won’t stop their PDA’s, next time they do it walk away.  Middle of the conversation, hanging out at home, whatever just walk away.  Hopefully they eventually realize they’re being ridiculous.   "
"Totally!  I was like *wtffffff*... why would you repeat that brutal, totally irredeemable comment to your girlfriend? 

Either he's a total clueless idiot or he's abusive himself,  wants to knock you down a peg...

He should absolutely not have repeated that to OP."
"Sure, or maybe he was extremely hurt and offended and shocked and shared something with his gf because he wasn’t sure if he should be reacting or not and how he should be reacting. There is a third option here he doesn’t have to be an asshole. I seriously doubt he was trying to go out of his way to hurt the mother of his child as nothing in her post indicts he does that sort of thing."
"I am in no way, shape or form defending your GF because she behaved like a rude petulant child.  However her behavior is coming from incredible insecurity.  As you yourself said, she’d never been to a restaurant remotely that nice and she reacted by rejecting it and your parents before it became clear to everyone that she had no idea how to act in that situation.  She was terrified of making a fool of herself and decided to show her ass to deflect that.

That said, if you stay with this girl you’ll be in for a life of irrational anger until she deals with her issues, and your parents will always remember her behavior at a $1500ish dinner.  Not a great start. "
"This sort of behavior is highly manipulative and abusive towards you; you can't hold yourself responsible for her choices or let yourself be taken hostage by them. 

I hope to God she does have the abortion, and then you need to get away ASAP.  Protect yourself, record things as necessary, have witnesses, etc. 

Also...not giving medical advice here...but multiple personalities is a diagnosis that's still iffy if it actually exists, but I'd do some reading on Borderline Personality Disorder."
"You are being naïve, not paranoid. I would have ended it when she lied the first time about seeing that guy. Good people with good intentions don't lie. "
"I wouldn't.  A housewarming party usually merits a more ""token"" gift than a wedding, and creating a registry implies you expect a certain level of gift.  You may even end up getting fewer gifts because people are put off by the registry and don't come, or feel that they cant afford to give more than a nominal gift.

Plus, neither weddings nor housewarming parties are intended to be windfalls for you -- they are celebrations you want people to share with you -- so your feeling that you ""missed"" an opportunity is off-base.  

Housewarming is like any other gift giving holiday (birthday, xmas, etc)...you are gonna end up with some useless gifts, but you should be thankful people are giving you gifts at all."
"holy crap i can't believe these people. putting aside that it's none of their business for a moment, why on earth do they care so much? how boring is your office that this would be office gossip? damn.

don't even think about letting these idiots run you out of that job. you like it and it pays well. HR isn't going to step up (it's not really their job). so it's up to you. i wouldn't go to corporate (they'll just parrot what HR has told you).

i'm the kind of person that likes to be proactive. i would choose to call a meeting with all the employees that are harassing you, tell them that you don't understand their fascination with your family dynamics but if anyone has any questions you will answer them now, but that after this you expect for the matter to be settled, that they are to leave your family members alone and that you will not stand for any further prying into your personal business.

"Honestly, first thought when reading this is that the guy is autistic or somewhere on the spectrum."
"Dating a man twice her age, and who was also her employer, shows poor judgement.

If you make shitty decisions, you will be judged for them. It's ignorant to think that you will never be judged."
"That was a really shitty thing for her to say. I'm sorry.

I wouldn't accept the gifts anymore. Do you still live with her?"
"Yeah and on top of that:

- still being pissy a WEEK later

- Citing him ""going dutch"" as a reason she is considering a breakup

- Citing him not doing chivalrous/sexist things as another reason.

OP sounds like a brat"
"This is actually a pretty manageable problem because the husband is on her side. Together, they're a united front, and can pretty much dictate the terms of any contact with the children.

So I would argue that ""no contact"" isn't necessary, when they could just limit it to family gatherings with husband and wife both there.

No contact is always an option though. "
That may be but she should learn conflict resolution in general otherwise she will be in an unhealthy relationship regardless of who it's with. Running away and giving silent treatment isn't going to lead to any healthy relationships
What the hell are you still doing there then? 
"My parents were pretty understanding and I could no-questions-asked call them to pick me up. Especially if drugs were involved. I only had to do it twice but it was a life-saver. 


Use this line and stay that person for your cousin. 


Only have a serious talk with her parents and her if this become a pattern of behavior. "
"Why doesn't OP report her as a patient, the person who's rights were actually violated?  Would that carry more or less weight than an employee who is ""tattling"" on a coworker? "
"I'd invite my friends and my sisters. None of the rest of the family. It's tough because our families live in the same area (it's a big area, but still) and there's 0 chance my gf will ever move away from her family (and I don't blame her) so we're bound to run into them from time to time at a grocery store or a mall or whatever. "
"I feel like OP is embarrassed? I live with my best friend and I’m a stripper so I’m pretty much used to being naked 24/7 having full on conversations with my co workers topless/naked and they have no problem being respectful and looking me in the eyes while I talk to them. At home I walk around naked all the time and I have big windows and so does my best friend. OP your girlfriend is clearly comfortable in your own home and around you enough to be naked because she feels safe and secure. If that’s a problem for you than you guys might not share the same ideals with what makes you comfortable/uncomfortable. Also if you attach nudity and seeing her naked all the time as seeing her as less attractive not sure how that would work if she changed that and you guys stayed together for years what happens when you’ve seen her naked hundreds of times after a few years of sex. Your friends giving you a hard time has more to do with them and their issues and hang ups, not anything to do with your girlfriend who is comfortable with being in her own skin and her home. Nudity isn’t a big deal. "
"The girlfriend hasn’t apologised, OP thinks she should just get over it, and learn to like this woman. No. You can’t forgive someone who shows zero remorse, nor should anyone expect you to. If you make zero effort to apologise to someone you tormented, you haven’t changed and you don’t get to elbow your way into their family. OP and his awful fiancée could have easily handled this, but didn’t. Sucks for them. "
Not what I’d personally class as a close relative. He’s only been dating OP’s mom for a year. What I meant was a relative you’ve literally known you’re entire life (or they’ve known you for your entire life) and have regular contact with.
"So frustrating. My husband DIED at age 35 from health issues which directly stemmed from head trauma received playing sports. But because it’s not instant, people ignore the risk. "
It legitimately sounds like her life would have been better if he was dead. It's sad to say but if the story she is saying is true it certainly seems so. How outlandish is it to say that to someone that did the horrible things he did? Why should he have immunity from his bad choices?
"It is never easy to do the right thing.  If Jayden was pulling a drunk girl away from a party it wouldn't be easy to stand up to him then and there to stop him.  If you spend a year looking for a job and when you finally find one you discover your boss is doing something dangerous, it isn't easy to stand up and report it.  It wasn't easy for people to hide jews from the Nazis.

I REALLY like your parents because this is exactly how character is built.  They are 100% right.  Do the right thing now, deal with the consequences, and some day in the future when it really matters you are going to be more likely to do the right thing then.

Time for you to decide what kind of man you want to be."
Right. But my point is that they have no idea just how insane a Michigan winter is. Unless they're from like.. Siberia. The windchill that comes off those lake is fucking insane. 
"She lied to your girlfriend in a deliberate attempt to break up a happy relationship and poach your girlfriend so she could set her up with her sociopathic, sexually-assaulting son? Honestly, your aunt sounds sociopathic as well. People are not toys that you can just steal from one person and hand off to another, and even if she *was* a toy, that is a shocking thing to do. 

And your family thinks this is all *fine*? 

Honestly, I would reconsider spending time with *any* of the family. "
"Dude, I'm sure she loves you to some extent, but she's not choosing you.  She is choosing herself and the life she wants.  When someone breaks up with you, you don't go stalker on them.  It's not romantic to ""fight for love"" like this.  She is breaking up with you.  I'm sorry that this hurts, but denying her ability to make her own choices is very condescending and disrespectful of you.  You need to accept the fact that her priorities are different from yours.  It was cruel of her if she purposefully made you believe you had a future together when she had no intention of it, but you can't change that and ruining her wedding or causing problems in her family won't make you feel better.  A breakup only requires one person to want out."
"Yes, exactly. The OP should be paying especially close attention to the women in this thread who say they *unintentionally* caused a breakdown in their marriage by not prioritizing their partner *enough*. They didn't realize they were doing it, or didn't realize how damaging it was, until it was almost too late.

It's so important to keep up with partnerly affection, intimacy, one-on-one time, conversations about non-baby-related things, maintaining hobbies together, etc. Your child will become independent and (hopefully) one day move out on their own, and when that day comes, if you've nurtured your relationship with your spouse, you'll simply be beginning a new chapter in your married life, rather than discovering you have nothing in common anymore or that you've lost the love, lust, and friendship you once shared. 

"
"She doesn't owe you anything. He does. He needs to fucking put his foot down if he wants to be your partner. HIM saying and acting in accordance with you being number one is the only thing that will put her in her place. 

He isn't respecting you or the relationship. Especially if he is letting her get away with this. He needs to commit to you and is certainly not doing that. 

I would be honestly pissed if I was that girl's bf. No wonder they are having problems. "
"&gt; She says they just hugged but I have my doubts.

As you should. 

You love her and it sounds like you don't want an open relationship or a marriage where there's no love. This is not healthy for your kids unless you want them to think an open marriage is the norm and that mommy dating and sleeping around is OK while daddy is unhappy but stoic. Maybe that's a bit dramatic but this wouldn't be a good arrangement for your children.

Get divorced, it's best for everyone."
"Yeah if we tally it up:

OP &amp; Friends:

* Do no research on concert tickets, hand over an arbitrary amount of money to someone's parents

* Upon finding they're more expensive, claim that none of them have, or can acquire $55

* Demand that the parents dispose of the tickets and return their money

The parents: 

* Made the somewhat questionable decision to buy more expensive tickets rather than lose the opportunity all together

* Kept the money they would have otherwise been out when they sold the tickets

I agree that, as the adults in the situation, and the people who pulled the trigger on the purchase, it's not completely unreasonable for the parents to have covered the cost.  But jesus christ, I'd never do another favor for those kids again.  And I'd make damn sure *my* kid paid me back."
"Why can’t he get a job now and do YT on his spare time to build his YT career? A lot of YT people start that way initially. 

Also don’t pay for his student loans. If you want to pay for other expenses, that’s fine I guess. But to pay his loans on top of your own? You’re going to be broke as hell for a very very long time. He is 26 years old, he shouldn’t have his 22 year old gf pay for his student loans.."
"Your partner is telling you what she needs. 

It does not matter what her reasons are. It does not matter if you do not agree with or understand her reasons. When someone that you love and care about tells you what they need, it is not your place to question. 

I recently told my boyfriend of 5 years, who I met when I was 19 as well, the same thing. He broke up with me a week later. I'm angry and devastated and hurt and questioning everything about our time together. But you know what? As painful as it is, he did me a favor. Because I don't deserve to spend these valuable years waiting and wishing for something that isn't going to happen. 

If you love this woman and want to do right by her, then respect what she's just told you. Take it very seriously. 

You can either commit or you can leave. 
If you choose not to do one of those things, and soon, you are doing nothing but wasting her precious time.  "
"&gt;&gt; I am an extroverted introvert if that makes sense: I am social on my terms.

The term is ambivert if you're interested :)"
"Seriously, this is bizarre."
I personally think YOU should report her. Give your husband the out with his coworkers. She’s toxic. You’d be doing them all a favor 
"Yep, they are regretful, but don't seem truly apologetic. "
No regrets that you tried to make a guy cheat on his girlfriend with you. Classy.
The process’ purpose is also to protect adults and children from abuse. The glossed-over restraining order suggests that this is a factor here. 
"This is what I IMMEDIATELY thought upon reading the title. Now I have to go revisit that nightmare of a thread, THANKS"
"Life is troublesome enough without a girlfriend who adds unnecesary complications just because.

You could have met her mother on Wednesday and have Sunday for some alone couple's time, with a proper goodbye since you were her bf and would soon be leaving for another country. She went to the movies instead and chose to spend your last day together with her mother awkwardly watching you eat curry.

Considering the distance(physical and emotional), and that awkward last week together, I think breaking up by phone(or even by text) is more than justified in this case. Ask to skype if you feel it would give a better closure. If she says she's too busy, that's your answer. It will be harder to let go while you still haven't officially broken up.


And try not to think too much about what could have been but wasn't. You're in another country, time to immerse in new experiences and start looking at what's ahead of the road."
I agree with this. It seems like she is having separation anxiety and looking for a reason to not have to go. 
"He sounds like he needs constant attention. HUGE red flag is that he visited you in the hospital when you had your appendix taken out and he was 1)messaging another woman 2)going to a bar with an ex girlfriend....wtf? No no no. He does not seem like he wants something serious at this moment and if you are, you need to find it with someone else. This type of behavior doesn't go away overnight. You deserve someone who is honest, caring, STAYS WITH YOU AT THE HOSPITAL WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR APPENDIX TAKEN OUT, and loves you unconditionally. 

"
"My doctor mentioned PPD at my most recent appointment. I'll talk to her about therapy when I go back next week. I'll see if she can recommend someone for this specifically. I forgot some of them do sessions through Skype.

Thank you. "
"Hi OP, I'm so sorry this is happening, this must hurt you a lot. Would Lisa be willing to attend therapy with both of you? Also, bravo on figuring out a way to make this work for you both (though it could have been *really* ugly, from the way you guys went about it!)."
"No, cancel this plan and break up with her. Find a girl that's more conventional for you man. You're not compatible with her, and again, she's technically already married."
"It sounds like your husband thinks you have a drinking problem.  It also sounds like you drink a lot, whether it is a problem or not...  You got drunk when you (from his point of view) had agreed not to, you also went along when you (again, from his point of view) agreed not to.  

Here is the thing, I don't think you should 'abide by his rules' or something, but I do think you have a responsibility to engage in communication. So if he says 'don't drink too much' and you say 'I won't', then you shouldn't because you need to keep your word.  But he also doesn't have the right to dictate what you do, so it is fine to either say 'I really feel like just seeing how my night goes', or telling him (perferably not in the moment) that you really don't see those things as his bussiness.  

It sounds like what is happening now is that he says 'don't do X', and you give it the ol 'ok sure' as if it is just general conversation/concern, but he sees it as actually making an agreement.  So, then from his point of view you are breaking agreements, and that makes your drinking/behavior look shady and problematic and undermines his trust generally.  

I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here that you guys have fallen in to a bad dynamic around choices/control where you are acting out.  If he is controlling in other ways it could be more serious. "
"Ya know, you just gave me an idea.  I should probably call the *daughter* and encourage her to take care of her groom or else she is going to face a lifetime of MIL problems."
honestly? yeah. it is. marriage vows are cute but spending your whole life in a loveless marriage because of a pledge you made at 24 makes zero sense
"Go by yourself. Honestly, you sound very, very smart, resourceful, and great at navigating life even under difficult circumstances. I have a feeling you and your daughter will THRIVE when you no longer have to live with the constant negativity, second guessing, complaining, and having to justify every decision you make. He is not being a partner at all, and you will actually have to carry less weight and have better life balance once you are single, I promise."
"Husbands relationship is his to navigate, so long as it doesn't compromise the attention / emotional energy / financial resources that need to go to his wife and child.

You need to protect yourself and your child OP, because she WILL turn this into a competition and try to squeeze every last drop of energy, money and attention out of your husband."
"Pffft, responsible adults only drink on vacation.  You've got to clear your schedule for a week at least! "
"By all means, alienate Kelly in favor of her self centered asshole of a sister. But nobody should be surprised when the selfish asshole continues to be a selfish asshole even after she gets your money. Frankly your aunt and uncle are incredibly lucky that Kelly ever forgave them for attending the wedding. They most definitely do not deserve her continued support if they resume contact with Alice. Here’s hoping the daughter who slept with her sister’s husband will take half decent care of her aging, ill parents. But I wouldn’t bet on it. 

How would you feel if Kelly wanted to cozy up to someone who mugged you seven years ago and used the fact that you did the hard work of overcoming your trauma to justify it? That’s a hard no for obvious reasons. "
"I feel like, in reading all the OP responses, that OP is actually Kelly, here looking for back up for her actions. 

The defense, semantics arguments, etc, are all completely over the top. ""Kelly isn't making anyone do anything."" ""Kelly is just protecting herself."" Etc.

Kelly is absolutely forcing people to do things, even if she isn't saying those exact words. She's forcing people to choose, rather than allowing them to make their own decisions about love, forgiveness, human fault, and  honesty. A family member made a mistake and fell in love with the wrong person. A huge colossal awful hurtful action, years ago. It's perfectly acceptable for Kelly to never again have contact. But to hold everyone else to her own standard of punishment or threaten them with being cut off forever? That's just selfish. You can't force everyone else into your pain. 

And it's not protecting herself. Against what? The possibility that someone might suggest to get that they reconcile? A suggestion she can shoot down with a word. At that point she would even be justified to say, ""Speak to me about this again and we will no longer be on speaking terms."" Her boundaries can be her boundaries without her deciding what everyone else's boundaries must be for when they are not with her. 

But there's no real threat. There's nothing to protect herself from. Maybe paranoia? But more likely just the desire to continue to hurt and punish her sister by ensuring she receives no love and support. 

Kelly can't heal herself while she is still actively enacting vengeance. While still purposefully inflicting pain back on her sister, she's still living in the dark place. Since there is no actual threat to her, punishment is the only reason she can have for continuing to force everyone into no contact. 

If I was her current husband, I would be uncomfortable that her focus on this was still so strong. I would think that in the end there could be some light that her sister did this because it showed for her current marriage. Does Kelly wish it had never happened? That she has ended up with Bob in the end? I can understand her still being hurt, but to still be so angry as to actively be engaging in the war still, by continuing to demand others engage who are no longer as invested? That shows some mental prioritization of this pain. 

Kelly is being cruel and selfish and manipulative. This doesn't mean that what her sister did wasn't awful and unforgivable, (and yes, worse) but I think Kelly should seek some serious therapy to try and heal. Just because what her sister did was so bad, and it was, doesn't mean that Kelly gets a free pass from behaving badly herself. Maybe someone even does get a free pass to behave badly for a while. Not for years on end."
"If your mom is hosting her...unfortunately it's up to her. It would be different if you had your own place, but it is up to your mom how long this girl (and I say girl because though both of you are legal age, you are still very young) stays at her home.

Given that you are an adult, if you don't like this, I would find a way to leave and take care of yourself. I realize that this may not be possible given the reasons you've enumerated, but I think that's where you are unfortunately.

My guess is he wasn't happy for whatever reason but was also non-confrontational. That would explain why she felt blindsided. 
"Ask her what led to her spiritual revival. Maybe it has to do with family, maybe it has to do with new friends. Talk to her about it, though."
"I do almost all of these -- I acknowledge I'm a slight weirdo and I do have ADHD (which has some comorbidity/overlap symptoms with anxiety/OCD -- saw others mentioned those) but for the most part I'm a normal functioning 30 yo woman, with a few personality quirks. FWIW my husband has stuck around for 10 years. He says not knowing what to expect from me (in a harmless way, of course) keeps things interesting. And he gets a good laugh out of watching me get flustered ordering food at restaurants. 

Honestly, talking to your cats is just common courtesy and a nice thing to do. They're living creatures, after all. I chat with my cat -- and myself -- all day. "
"Yeah, the whole ""oh wait here's a wedding ring"" thing... Not memorable"
Not when they abuse you and take advantage of you. Treating them well is hurting you financially and emotionally. You probably should see a therapist and ask them about codependency. 
"He might start the shower, use the toilet, and plan to flush on the way out. I've forgotten to flush this way before - but like once or twice ever, not all the time."
"Yeah people are acting so calm about this I feel like I'm going crazy. This man is seriously fucked up and as a brother OP, you need to step the fuck up and do something about it. "
You need to re-examine your ability to help people. You‘re not as good at it as you think you are. 
"On some level, Casey is ok with this scenario."
"This is a really good question. I don’t know if I could be friends with someone who blurted out things like that. Verbal diarrhea every once in a while is one thing, but this seems to be on a whole new level."
"I think it’s about way more than the drink, judging by OP’s other comments in the thread. Sounds like she has some kind of undiagnosed issue that’s causing her to act abnormally. "
"If your friends don't accept that you don't want to drink, they aren't your friends. I never drank during high school, but by god even my friends who were party animals respected that and never once gave me any trouble for it!"
