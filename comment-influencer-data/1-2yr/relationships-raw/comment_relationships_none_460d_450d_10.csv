"&gt; I’m wrecked at the thought of breaking up my child’s parents

You need to take that thought, crumple it up into a ball and throw it out the window. Replace it with the knowledge that you can't be the role model, loving parent and support systems that a child needs, until you are no longer married to a spoiled teenager. "
[removed]
"It'll make it a challenge, but like... this is not a situation you created.  Your focus needs to be on making the best possible life for you and your child.  I think that as long as your husband isn't dangerous, he deserves a chance at fatherhood, even if it's long distance, so I'm not one to recommend that you cut him out of your kids life for being a cheater.

You also have an added layer of protection, because the UCMJ frowns on people cheating on their spouses.  It's not illegal per se, but it's so deeply frowned upon that it can occasionally be a career killing move, depending on a person's chain of command.  I would advise you to use this carefully.

To an extent, if he values his career, and is sane and otherwise mentally competent, this is your ""get out of marriage free"" card.  You can tell him to leave you alone and let you go without a fight, and give you a simple divorce with no drama, and in exchange, you will leave town, be divorced, and work with him on a coparenting plan.  If he doesn't, you will start making phone calls, because right now, your focus is being healthy for your child, and anything he does that jeopardizes that is something you're not willing to deal with.  

This won't work if he's not career minded, or is... unbalanced in some way.  If that's the case, just get out and stay out.

If you at any time feel even a little bit unsafe, or like he might hurt you or your family, don't hesitate - get somewhere safe and start making phone calls.  You likely have a list of phone numbers for his chain of command.  If you have to use them, don't pussyfoot around - start phoning and tell them ""My husband is 'rank lastname' and last week I caught him having sex in our home with a woman whose uniform nametag reads 'lastname from nametag'.  He is threatening to hurt me/stalk me/kill himself, and I am afraid.  I need time to pack my things so I can get out of our house.""

If you don't have phone numbers and you feel unsafe, you can call the MP's, or the base chaplain, or call the base public affairs office and ask them who you should talk to.

You can keep that card in your pocket, or play it, but essentially, your husband probably does NOT want his chain of command to find out that he is not capable of keeping his marital vows.  If he has a security clearance, then he's a liability because as far as they are concerned, he can be baited into cheating, and be blackmailed into sharing information.  If he has a leadership position, then he's a liability because fraternization is very bad, and is exponentially worse if he's fraternizing with someone in his own chain of command.

This is not a situation you created.  You're just living your life, getting ready to be a mom.  He'll have to deal with how to be a parent on his own, but for now, the things he owes you are; respect as the future mother of his child, child support, and an apology followed by being supportive as you decide what you want out of life.

Edited to add your body is your own.  He has no parental rights right now because he is not a parent until the baby is born.  Even then, he can't make you do anything you don't want to do.  You can go wherever you want, whenever you want.  I would suggest figuring out where you want to live, and then getting there before you have the baby, because it will be easier to move and get a job and stuff before you're hugely pregnant, or trying to schlep a baby across country, and if you have family back in Cali, that seems like a soft landing pad."
"I’m confused. Seizures and panic attacks are different things. This doesn’t sound like a seizure to me but could be a panic attack. Some people do go to the ER with a panic attack but it’s because they don’t know it’s a panic attack and they think there’s something physically wrong. Is this what keeps happening? 

For reference, I have gone to the ER with a panic attack but at the time I thought I was dying. Once they figure out it’s a panic attack they usually just shrug and send you home."
I hope they're pleased with watching me do the same thing every day.
"The clock is ticking.  You need to move before you have the kid.  If you have the kid in VA, this will likely lock you in.  I'd take a phone consult with a CA attorney in the area you are planning to move to as soon as you can to plan your strategy.

CA has a 6 month residency requirement.  If you move today, file for divorce in CA on Dec13th. 

Alternately you can file in VA, but then VA will have jurisdiction going forward for court proceedings. "
"&gt; I value her friendship 

why? Best case scenario, she's ignoring a serious health issue to drink. Much more likely she's taking up valuable resources with her antics.

Next time she wants to go to a bar, don't go with her. Tell her you don't think she should drink anymore, because these ""seizures"" only happen when she's drinking. If she insists on going, tell her you won't be a party to her damaging her health.  "

"$100 is not expensive for a ring, but it is expensive for a ""I saw this and thought of you"" random gift for just-a-friend. Jewelry is a girlfriend thing. Maybe your mum or your sister."
[deleted]
Dated more than my share of vegetarians and vegans. Never seen on that had any issues with me eating meat around them. Oo
"What is and is not intimate will vary by person; jewelry isn't **necessarily** intimate. Rings are more likely to be than, say, earrings, but OP says that she wears a lot of rings, so it's not unreasonable for us (or BFF) to think that rings aren't intimate to her.

BFF's GF might disagree, but I don't think we should assume that she does by default, especially if she was present when he bought the ring."
"&gt; This is something everyone should figure out prior to marriage
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I blame us for marrying to young. This was a issue we should have settled prior to marriage.

Honestly? At age 22, I would have sworn on a stack of Bibles a mile high I didn't want kids. Ever. That didn't change until I was 32. So having 'decided on this before you got married' may have changed anyhow, down the line. 

Unfortunately, the problem is, now you have to decide which you want more, your wife, or kids. 

My partner stalled me on kids, trying to run my clock out. If I had it to do over again? Would 1000% choose having kids over the guy. But that's just me. What I did learn was 'choose which you want, and go for it'. Don't wait for them to change their mind, and don't settle for a life you don't want. If you settle, resentment will eat at the relationship anyhow, and you may end up with neither. "
"OP, I am so sorry you are going through this. You are such a good parent and so diligent. 

In this situation, I’d probably give guardianship to your sister and have the kids move to Delaware. It will be tough for them, of course. But I think it’d be easier to live with their aunt than with a friend’s parents. 

But have you asked them what they would prefer? They’re old enough to express their opinions and I’d ask what would be easiest on them. "
"This makes total sense and yes, feeling bad for them has been our issue with just demanding our privacy until it was taken too far! Thank you so much! "
"Yes, a good sub to read before marrying a mama’s boy. And a small note, the problems are caused by HIM not enforcing boundaries with his mother. The longer he can say that “other people cause problems” the less likely he will be to take any responsibility for his role in enabling crazy MIL."
This. Is. The. Absolute. BEST!! Thank you!!
"For one, don't develop any sort of friendship or relationship with your crush. Act 100% professional with her. Do not talk to her unless it is necessary for your work. Do not tell her about your crush.

Start putting more effort into your marriage. You have a 7 month year old baby. How much time are you spending with your wife? Are you going out on dates? Spend more time with her, be more romantic, take her out on dates, and if nothing else works, go to marriage counseling. Parenthood is stressful and crushes happen, but you do have control over your actions."
"This. You can't get in his arse about specifics because you are different people with different likes/dislikes, interests. Yes he may change his mind like the wind, but are you gonna be able to change him? No. And it will make him resent you, and make you feel like you are being a control freak (which is sounds like you are a tiny smidge).

First year is tough for everyone, even if you've been together for 4. Hang in there and KUDOS on the counseling. You will get into your groove.  Also, try really hard not to give the FIL thing too much weight. I understand they are similar, but that doesn't mean they are the same person. "
Have you suggested that she take the job since she’s so indecisive about her career choice. See how she responds and just give her every line she gave you. Maybe she will get perspective as why you don’t want to leave your profession that you are passionate about. And I totally feel you about hating the idea of working in an office. I prefer to be outside everyday regardless of weather.
"Here's the thing about fun money:  It's a great system for those who will honor it.  But, be prepared to discuss in advance the following:

1.  What will constitute a fun money expense.  Someone without financial discipline will run out and then try to make excuses why XYZ should be a household expense.

2.  No resentment if one person runs out of fun money first and no guilt trips that the other person isn't covering with their fun money.  You may wish to separate date night expenses from fun money, but even still, if he lack discipline do not be shocked if he runs out and then whines about it.

I've lived this and it ultimately ended my marriage.  I hope your situation is less dire in the end.  But, I caution you against simply adding an allowance for both of you to tap into and then thinking that's all there is to it.  Financial responsibility is a difficult thing to teach someone who never had it (or was never taught it because their parents didn't either).  And, it can invade all aspects of a marriage in a detrimental way."
You have a fiancé problem\- his relationship with his mother is unhealthy and he needs to learn how to say no and handle her. It's not your job to manage her \-it's his. Your fiancé should have sided with you about the vacation and he should have immediately stepped in and told his parents they can't speak to you like that when they brought up your family. 
"Ha, he probably knows that a drunken ""I love you"" that early in a relationship generally means ""I like you a lot so far."" If he hasn't brought it up and his behavior hasn't changed then let it go. He apparently has. "
"Honestly, that's what I was thinking. It's not that she wants someone to do the job, but specifically OP. She doesn't want to do it. Why should she expect OP to? What if OP said to her to leave her creative work and go back to school because a career in Computer Science does better than her creative work with literally no insurance? She would clearly not want to do that.

I also see people talking about being a SAHM. That decision is not her's alone. That is for the both of them to make and before she can try to upend his whole career to set herself up for something like that, they have to actually agree about her being a SAHM. Very disrespectful and shady way of behaving in a relationship.

Every other concern I could think of is just not being said. If she feels embarrassed by his work, she should be saying that. If she feels like he spends too much time at work, she should be saying that."
"NONE of the ideas he's presented you with would meet his four goals. He has to take care of his responsibilities before he can go for his dreams, and his responsibilities include paying down debt and taking care of his growing family.

Couples' counseling might be able to help. So might finding a career counselor for him to meet with. But if he thinks you're shutting down his hopes and dreams because you point out that lawyers don't get summers off, he might be beyond help at this point."
"You've been together for three years, so why is this suddenly becoming an issue now? You should have both discussed it and what the plan was *before* getting engaged."
"&gt; somehow LOSING money on a podcast (like, how even? I thought at worst he wouldn’t make money, actively losing that much money sounds odd as fuck)

My guess is that some guy who owns a recording studio convinced him that ""people will only take you seriously if YOU'RE serious"" and charges him $50 an hour (""discounted from my usual hourly"") to talk into a Shure SM7B."
"My husband was transported, non emergency, from one hospital to another. It was 56 miles and they charged him $1300."
"Don't wait. Cause right now if they're old enough, they're learning that this behavior is love. It's not. He's a rapist and abuser.  Leave him."
"I hate to say this but if he felt comfortable enough to take his mistress to YOUR house and have sex with her in what I’m assuming was YOUR bed in a very short time period that you were supposed to be gone, this is not his first rodeo. I’m willing to bet he’s been doing this for a long time and got comfortable because he knew he could sucker you.

He has wronged you 5 ways from Sunday. He moved you cross country from everything you know and love, got you pregnant and then cheated on you. In your house. Have no mercy. Take no prisoners. I am so sorry that you are going through this but you are strong and you have a support system that is ready when you are. I know it will be hard but it will be better for you and your baby in the long run. He can enjoy his child on weekends and holidays because that is the path he’s chosen. Big hugs and best of luck to you!"
You're a douchebag. You worried about hurting old girls feelings and in the meantime forgot about your wifes feelings. 
"yeah there was tension lessened between me and a male acquaintance of mine recently too. I thought he was quite attractive and very interesting, then I found out he was married and I DONT TEXT HIM ANYMORE. I might comment on his fb and say hi, get a drink or two if I see him out and about but I don’t privately text him, I don’t make plans with him without mentioning his wife or including her. I respect that he is a married man and treat the situation as such. His wife and their boundaries as a couple come first. 

 Neither you nor this girl are giving any attention to the fact that you are a married man. You are taken. I’m willing to bet those texts you think are casual? Are not so casual."
"&gt;I think I can say with certainty that for most couples, the person they're settling down with is not the person they had the absolute best sex with, and that's ok.

I agree it's okay, but I'm not sure I agree it's true for most people. It's certainly not something I'm planning on myself, and my track record with more emotionally-serious partners bears that out. I work hard to make my relationships the home of truly great sex, and my new relationship is quickly working its way among the best sex I've had. Given another few months, I'm sure we'll get to The Best. 

Now, your fiancée discovered this information about you by snooping. That's *not okay*, and you two need to discuss boundaries and mutual respect. She needs to understand how she transgressed here, and commit to not doing so again. She may be trying to deflect attention from that by magnifying her upset. If she were here, I probably would just say ""Tough."" Because there are good reasons snooping is a bad idea, not just for the relationship but for your own piece of mind. 

But she's not here, and there's likely some genuine concern behind her freaking out right now. So . . . I would ask yourself what you can do to make sex in this relationship better. Are there fantasies you hold back? Is there a style, position, or attitude you haven't let loose with your fiancée? Let her know you're willing to work with her to make the sex better (make sure she knows the sex you two have *is* objectively great. And if that's not true . . . do you really want to marry her?). You might get farther with her on the snooping front if you lead with the sex issue and work from there. Is it the bigger deal? Probably not, definitely not to you, but the relationship is probably worth *you* being the bigger person here."
This right here is serious manipulation. This sounds IDENTICAL to my ex husband as I stated in my post below. Get out. You don’t need his permission. Pack your shit and leave while he’s gone if you have to. This man is a controlling narcissistic asshole and you’re way too young to be dealing with this nonsense. No one should have to deal with this shit. Sorry; I’m super passionate. Listen to your gut. I didn’t and I nearly destroyed my entire life. 
"I don't think I can advise you on ot being a threat. But if I were the husband, I'd have been forever grateful to you. "
"Well if this isn't the wake up call she so desperately needs, then yeah, this has no future.

State it that way. ""Honey, if this isn't.... etc"""
"I'm not sure what you expect here, OP.  Your parents were clearly playing favorites and they got burned because their son is now spoiled.  They should take all his gaming stuff away and make him go get a summer job when he's old enough to pay your parents back.  

You should stick with your plan of moving out as soon as possible.  At that point, it really isn't your problem anymore.  "
[deleted]
"Ok, it is very important to mention it in your post. He may have a hard time associating sex with love. Or he prefers to use another word. Instead of sexy, ask him if he finds you attractive or appealing."
"Um, someone posted this EXACT story a few months ago. Was it you? Because you say it happened ""recently"", but then proceed to tell this story about New Years, which one is it?"
"It's not beard burn. It's stubble. Beards are much softer. 

So either shave more or grow it out. Stubble is fucking sand paper. 

There's gotta be a sweet spot and you'll have to figure out where. Two days unshaven is my boyfriend's limit before it hurts my face too much. "
"Ok, so let's pretend you guys have a maid service.

Which you spend 400 bucks a month on.(which for full time maid service is super low)

Would he be ok if you decided to fire the maid and take 200 out of his account instead?

No because why would he if it doesn't save him any money?

I understand you wanting to keep your pet as yours. But if you two aren't planning a future together then you can just tell him no and keep paying the pros. There would be no reason (for him) to help you without monetary benefit and paying an SO for a service isn't a great idea(because they aren't professionals and you'd get irritated if he couldn't do it at a certain time/day or couldn't do it right like the pro can)

If you want to build a future remember your pet is (kinda) like a kid. Is he going to be your partner and adopt your pet? Or is he going to maintain distance and leave 100% of pet parenthood up to you? What would you prefer?

If you guys are a team I dont think there should be any talk of paying one another for services. I can see how this suggestion is annoying and sort of worrisome.  "
It is taking the high road. Very mature and laudable to react in this way to  people wgo betrayed her
"yeah, I mean Nature and his GF are both telling him that he needs to shave. I get not wanting to shave every day (guilty!) but when you are torturing your loved one, and amusing/appalling passers by...."
"She doesn't just want the child, she wants the pregnancy experience as well. To feel a new life growing in her, to feel those first flutters, to see her body change as the baby grows, to experience the joy of those kicks. Adopted or donor, either way the child would not be yours biologically, and you would really deny your wife those joys just so that you are on an even playing field? Either you can accept a non bio child as your own or you can't. But to insist that she give up pregnancy in order to soothe your own ego is pretty selfish. And frankly, since she's healthy and presumably won't have trouble conceiving, sperm donation will be cheaper and much less stressful than attempting to adopt an infant."
"&gt;This is not an every day occurrence

It is a Today occurance, and that enough to make it a serious problem. You’re getting defensive instead of recognizing your role in your mother’s behavior. "
"I know this sub recommends people break up all the time, but reading this all I could do is wonder why you're with this guy. You can do better. "
"&gt; She has $50k+ in college debt

What did she go for college for if she is refusing to get work?

"
A friend of mine has Ks and lets them flop in the wind 
"You go, girl, you little strumpet of the night!"
"&gt; Also this girl keeps asking me to do stuff and finding reasons to come over, why?

Hmm"
"If you're uncomfortable telling her off out of the blue, you can try waiting until she says something particularly nasty about you or your parents (which doesn't sound like it would take long) and then just say something like ""Your constant negative attitude adds an unhealthy amount of stress to my life. I'm not interested in any sort of relationship with you. Please don't contact me again."" and then block her.  I'm uncomfortable telling people off out of nowhere, but people like that will always give you an opening to do it more naturally."
Because he's given you every reason to distrust him and not one single one to trust him.
"If she is voting for politicians that have an anti\-LGBT agenda, then she has a problem with the LGBT community. She might be seeing that she is bass\-ackwards in her views, and think that attending a pride event with a rainbow flag will erase all the hurt she has caused to her own sister and other members of the LGBT community.

OP, my revenge fantasy would include calling her out in a very public way, but that of course that will come with consequences. Not sure if it would be worth it or not. Maybe an email to start?"
"Oh my god, this! He's acting like he's just a passenger on this train, when he's really been the conductor the whole time! He's a victim of his own stupidity."
"Well for one thing, it’s not cool to go through someone else’s browser history. When you go through anyone’s stuff you WILL find stuff you won’t like.

Secondly, maybe these kinks of hers are stuff she likes to fantasize about but not something she wants done to her.  Leave her alone."
"Say you want a divorce and move out. Problem solved. You're away from your spouse who is abusing you emotionally and you won't have to live with a smelly unstable woman you're no longer attracted to.

The sad thing is, there's a big chance this will be the kick in the rear she needs to prompt her to start taking better care of herself and being presentable again. Without you as a crutch, she's forced to interact with other people and she won't have any guys interested beyond a night (if that) if she's stinky, unwashed, and unkempt!

Staying with her will only enable her. If she can't cope and have a mental breakdown then maybe that's what needs to happen so she finally gets the mental care she needs to address her issues. **You cannot save her.**"
"Good. Keep updating us. Even if you can't get your belongings or documents, the cops should be able to take you, even if in a day or two, to fetch things under supervision so he can't kill you.

Do you have family you can call? I know a lot of times people think family won't help, but in cases like this most families will help out."
"&gt; I know I have a strong personality and that can cause some friction, but I really genuinely wanted to talk things out and come to a cease-fire.

Sounds like you two are too similar to get along. Both of you are holding onto small slights, don’t like each other, looking for reasons to dislike each other, etc. 

&gt; last summer where I tried to make friendly conversation with her and one of her friends, and they gave me one-word answers while talking very animatedly with each other in between my questions. 

&gt; including the fact that I didn't say hi to her at a party once, several years ago.

Basically the same complaint. 

&gt; Every time I tried to interject to defend myself or talk something through, 

&gt; while she was steamrolling me and not allowing me to have my opinion. 

Again basically the same thing. “Interject” is just a nicer way to say you interrupted her. 

&gt; she desperately needs her own reality show on E! and that we will never see eye-to-eye. 

&gt; Friend's SO is a 1st-class drama queen, need tips on how to move forward like an adult *so we don't end up killing each other.*

Even just the way you write is dramatic. You got drunk and decided to cry and confront her about where she and her husband vacation and how she didn’t speak to you enough at a party last year *despite the fact that you two don’t get along.* She apparently was happy to just grin and bear the awkwardness at parties. You decided to have a drunken confrontation. Just stop nosing into someone else’s marriage and stop trying to make her behave the way you want her to. You don’t have to be best buddies with her to be in the same room at the same time. This really is some childish bullshit."
There is absolutely no reason to stay together with someone like this. Move on with you life. 
"You cannot change her. You cannot get her to understand anything she doesn't want to understand. You can only change how you interact with and respond to your wife. 

I recommend seeking out counseling to learn better ways of dealing with your mentally ill wife. 

 I have a immediate family member with bipolar disorder &amp; a spouse with depression. Seeing a counselor has been VERY helpful for me for both. "
"&gt;He is incapable of love. He's a condescending asshole. He's a parasite. I sincerely doubt he'll find anyone at all with his attitude

:O 

&gt;And you, hon, need some therapy for your low self esteem, that kept you dating this POS

Much needed, thank you. "
"There's a reason he's dating someone 20 years his junior, and it has to do with the fact that you are spending your time trying to prove yourself and make it up to him instead of breaking up with him. Don't be the sucker he expects you to be."
"And it makes you wonder about the genesis of the issue, doesn't it?"
My name is on the lease thank god
"My dad was like this, and I think the nerd thing is a distraction. For my Dad, he was into cars.. at different times my brothers and I both got into car racing or go-kart racing because it was all we could do for him to show an interest. Neither of us has ended up following the people around us. I can tell you now though that he doesn't have much of a relationship with any of his Grandkids (18 of them, some he hasn't met). I married someone who is the opposite and who goes to the ballet recitals and all the BS that secretly none of us wants to do all the time. You can bet that any time there is a swim meet or a gym comp or anything else, my husband is there without question. 
My mother, when I was a teenager, pulled over the car once and just said ""Please promise me that you won't marry someone like your father. Find someone who wants to spend time with his family"""
"Ok, he’s not going to leave. He’s an unemployed alcoholic who also happens to be a creeper asshole. So you need to be the one to extract yourself and your children from this toxic, unsustainable environment.
Stop trying to figure out why and what he's done, it’s not fixable. And if it were, it’s not on you to fix. It’s on you to protect yourself and your kids from this shitstorm of a relationship.
I understand why you’d want to lash out and hurt him. He’s a terrible person. But put that anger energy into getting out, cutting him off clean, and moving on. Talk to a lawyer."
"I’ll ask this here since I haven’t seen anyone else bring it up: are you sure you aren’t invited? You said the wedding is in December, but it’s only June. Official invitations won’t be out until September or so, and you don’t need a save-the-date since you are already booked.

Denise is acting weird but Jen is the one who matters. Is it possible that she means to invite you and assumes that you assume you are invited?"
"Since he's unhappy with the idea of contributing emotionally to the family, ask if he'd like a divorce. My guess is that he won't give you an emphatic ""no"", but instead leave an open-ended response, hoping you will make that decision for him. "
I'll bet her makeup services will no longer be needed after this declination
"What a spectacular asshole.  That ""waste my time"" comment is in unforgivable territory to me, honestly.  I don't think that I could forgive someone that said that about their own (and **my**) child.  

This guy is doing incredible damage to your girls, that will pop up off and on throughout their entire life.  People are suggesting therapy, but the thing about that is that in order to change, you have to want to.  It doesn't sound like he has any interest whatsoever in altering his behaviour - and why would he?  He doesn't care about your feelings, he doesn't care about the kids feelings, therefore hurting you is not enough of a consequence for him to consider acting differently.  I honestly see this ending with a split, either soon or down the road, and in a few years you'll probably meet someone half-decent and have the revelation that most men aren't so heartless and selfish.  "
"&gt; Once you reach your goal, you need to have a serious chat with your husband.

Why wait at all for this chat? Her husband has been cheating on her, by sexting multiple other women. His rationalization might be that it’s because OP’s weight, but that doesn’t mean OP needs to address her weight issues before addressing his cheating.

Honestly, I would already be done with a partner who treated me with so little respect. But if they want it to work, *he* should be working his ass off to rebuild the trust in this relationship, *immediately*. Marriage counselors, establishing firm boundaries, the whole nine yards.

OP can definitely consider working towards a lower weight for her own sake, but that’s frankly unrelated to the issue of her partner cheating (other than serving as his convenient excuse)."
"Except that OP fucked up and talked about it, and now his wife is ashamed and crying and suffering the consequences of his action. "
"Her best friend does not need to be cut out. That's such a strong reaction when, according to your comments, there hasn't actually been a proper discussion about what your stupid drunk comment was about.

If your wife chooses secrecy over trying to save the friendship then she's in her rights to make that decision, but that's not the only option.

(She should really be posting here, not you)"
She openly bragged about wanting to cheat on him. That’s fucked.
"This is such bad logic and deep down you know it. There are two possiblities, either she cheats on you again or she doesn't. The probability that she cheats on you again is far greater than the probability that she doesn't.

Look at it this way, would you put 100k on number 16 playing roulette because one day you will look back and say what if?"
Do not go back. Call the police. 
"Leave her alone. There's literally nothing you can do. If you apologize, you'll have to explain what you're apologizing for, and that's going to make it even worse.

Look at this from her perspective for just a second:

You asked her to a nice restaurant for a meal. The waitress proceeded to treat her like dirt, while you did NOTHING except eat and stare at her like a dumbass, and maybe wiggle around in your chair a little. When she said ""this seems racist"" you **told her it wasn't** (like seriously, could you be any more privileged and oblivious). When she left you didn't go after her, and you haven't communicated with her since.

What exactly do you think *could* fix this? And how were you planning to hang out with Mary if you can't take her around your friend THE RACIST WAITRESS who, trust me, she WILL recognize.

**What, in short, was your plan?**"
"Honestly, she will probably ignore you.  "
"You’re thick.

What we’re trying to tell you is DONT DO DUPLICITOUS SHIT.

Duplicity is unethical. It’s bad.

"If she won’t get help for her mental health issues, either together in couples therapy or separately, you need to rethink your marriage. I also hope that you have zero plans for kids."
"You’ve lost your wife’s trust, and rightfully so. The fact of the matter is, some people can’t get over cheating. Your wife saying that she’s only with you for the kids is a big red flag. If she can’t trust you again, you shouldn’t stay married. It’s unhealthy. What have you done to build trust back up between you? Have you gone to couples counseling? If not, you need it."
"&gt;She needs help so that it doesn't manifest in ""daddy issues"" and she ends up being one of the ""I'm 17F dating a 32M"" posters here.

RED FLAG. It also sounds like he's a gaslighter. If I were you, I'd GTFO. Being super sweet and supportive and then changing later on is an abuser move. If you stay it'll just get worse."
"Whether SHE finds it a bit odd is not relevant whatsoever. That's her personal opinion on a relationship she has very minimal knowledge about. This kind of situation in a relationship is not unheard of, and if she is this offended by something that does not affect her AT ALL, she has serious issues she needs to address about herself. "

"But they DONT. Part of the characteristics of the symptoms of these illnesses is that they chronic. Mood swings in BP disorder are not like switching a light switch. They last for weeks to months. So saying “oh yeah I was happy then sad today so I have some symptoms of bipolar” is entirely incorrect. 

Everybody is not a little bipolar sometimes. Everyone is not a little OCD at times. That’s not how it works. "
"Lol yeah doesn't reply to any of the hundred people telling him NOT to propose on his birthday and finds one comment that says it's ok and goes with that. He's not looking for advice, he's looking for validation for a choice he's already made"
"I've been there, and you need to end it.  She is more important to him, and he's made that painfully clear.  Even if he said he'd stop talking to her, at this point you know it's more likely he'd say that but keep doing it anyway.  That's not the kinda of relationship you want.  You want someone who prioritizes you and your feelings, and isn't filling their time with you while waiting for someone else to come around. "
"You are still so young, do not let some douchebag ""enjoy your body"" one last time. You'll have plenty of time to do that with guys you *are* compatible with!

"Do you have any family that you trust?  Even a semi distant relative?  If you do, please call or visit them and let them know what's going on.  

Google ""your town + social services"" ""your town + services for at risk teens"" ""your town + low income housing"" and ""your state and county health department."" Call the numbers that come up.  Set up appointments and keep them.  Drag your sister to them. Many services are offered to young people until they are 21.  She will need a birth certificate and photo ID to access services.

I think if you really use all the resources you find on google, you can help your sister find safe housing and some mental health care at a low cost, mainly because of her age."

"&gt; white kids are way less likely to get caught and punished for things like skipping school and having weed

Can confirm, was white kid caught with weed, and skipped a ton of school while homeless in 12th grade. School cop made me flush it(if he touched it he would have had to write me a ticket), and nothing for the skipped school. They only caught me with the weed because my aunt tried to pull me out of school since I was no longer in the district(not having a home and all), and they called me down to the office."
"This plan is about you and the glorification of you.  Proposing to someone you love is about THEM. It's something you're going to be doing for her (you're giving her the ring, asking her to accept you, so it's a HER thing). Do it on a day that's not all about you and your convenience. Seems half\-assed.  Like, you didn't want to really bother planning anything for her, so you'll just do it at the end of your own party."
"No offence dude, but she clearly wants a romantic Italy proposal. If someone proposed to me the way you plan to propose I'd probably say no, because it shows that they don't know me in the slightest. Now you know your GF better than I do, and maybe she'd love the party thing, but honestly why not just do it on the beautiful romantic holiday like she wants rather than a day that will already be all about you rather than the both of you."
"**RUN RUN RUN**

He's a sexual predator, of course he's saying age doesn't matter and men like young girls to try to convince you that his behavior is okay so you'll agree to continuing things with him...why would adult men be attracted to young girls, other than for their age and nativity? Why does an adult man relate more to a minor than people his own age?

A 37 year old adult man has no business 'seeing' a 17 year old girl \- he's an adult, he knows fine well that this relationship is inherently unhealthy and he knows what he's doing is wrong, sorry but he doesn't care about you. It's normal for a younger woman to be attracted to an older man, it's flattering and may make you feel grown up, but that' exactly what this guy is counting on, the fact is a decent guy would have put a stop to this a long time ago.

Age is a factor when we're talking about legality and ethics, the power dynamics involved between teen girl and adult men makes for a very unhealthy relationship \- as a 17 year old you don't have the neurology or life and dating experience of an adult, he knows this and is continuing this relationship as he knows you'd be easier for him to manipulate. He is pursuing you because either he is ephebophiliac or because he knows women his own age wouldn't date him (as it requires him to make more effort with them or because they recognize he's a creep).

I suggest you cut all contact and let your folks know, if it's just been talking then he's done nothing illegal but they need to know so they can help protect you if he attempts to continue this or decides to take things further."

"I don't think you can live like that, it's a lot of strain on both of you. If you guys are uber close, maybe you could make it work for a while \- but I myself can't see it going on for long. It hurts now since you are pretty involved with her, but maybe it's best to break it off so neither of you are holding each other back."
"Let's see here. Being game and down to socialize with people you don't know (even when it's uncomfortable for you), and staying chill in the face of drama = ""unfun."" Getting sloshed to the point of crying and making a scene = ""fun."" According to someone who's... 30 years old. Hmm."
"Being an aggressive drunk is infinitely different than being an alcoholic. She never said he drinks every day or even often, just when he DOES drink he isn’t able to control his behavior (shocker). That’s not a qualifier for being an alcoholic..."
"Is the issue perhaps that you are consulting your sister on life\-related things and not your wife? Even if it isn't things ""to do with"" your wife, she's still your life partner she likely feels as though she should be the primary person whom you consult with. If you're still running ideas and such past your sister, instead of her (or even in addition to but giving a lot of noticeable weight to your sister's opinion), then that could explain her discomfort.  "
That's a possibility that can only be cleared up by him. Have you experienced another similar instance with him before? 
"I feel he's pretty committed to me.  I don't really feel he's going anywhere.  Our lives are very intertwined, he's always pushing me in my career and in general; he and I talk about our next projects and investments and steps in our lives all the time.  Sure, anybody can leave at any time, but I just don't get that sense.  He was the one who pushed to buy the house with me and move in together, and that involved him selling his house \- the first house he'd ever owned and the first thing he'd ever had of his own.  That's not a minor thing, at least not to me.

I don't love his attitude towards money so I suspect that my uneasiness about it stems from possibly taking too seriously what I hope was just an offhanded comment about the stupid Rolex vs committing to a vacation fund or something similar.

If I had it my way I would spend more money than we do.  I'd eat out more, take more trips, splurge a little more.  Based on his upbringing he can be really tight with money and when you're sharing household expenses and a life together it isn't ""right"" to just show up at home with a new $6,000 Chanel handbag.  I get it.  But maybe if I'm honest with myself the fact that he'd buy himself a luxury item first (maybe, I hope he was joking) when he's given me shit about me doing so when I've said I wanted something and I was going to buy it with my own earnings really irked me.

Reality is I've adapted my spending habits a lot more to his than he has to mine \- which is ok, I have savings and investments and am doing great but his comment about the watch really bugged me!"
"Seriously, you have no idea. When I read the original post, I immediately thought of my own parents, my mom was exactly in your SAHM wife's shoes and my dad makes a lot of money... that my mom has no real clue what is going with. We (the children) grew up thinking we were dirt poor and eating cheap mcdonalds instead of healthy proper meals because my mom thought we were always on the verge of going broke, while my dad lavishly spent on gold clubs, photography gear, expensive clothes, etc.  Instead of doing what you did, my dad gaslights my mom, berates her, puts her down saying she wouldn't understand anyways. And I think it's very common, I see it in a lot of my classmates' parents too, where the husband has all the financial control. 

It makes me so happy to see your update. Truly. It gives me hope that it can be different. "
"You should absolutely dump him OP, right now. Recording sex without consent *and then lying about it* should be a hard dealbreaker. "
It' selfish of you to reap the benefits of a relationship while keeping him in the dark of your intentions.
"Has he ever been interested in you the year that you’ve been together? You’ve only met with your children present?

There’s SO many red flags here - the app, the porn, the disinterest in you, “Daddy’s Kitten Amber” in his phone. You need to think about yourself and your best interests here and not your love for this man. Do not marry him - he won’t change if he’s clearly been this way since meeting you and it will only progress and cause resentment."
It wasn't a misunderstanding though. He did something horrible to his brother. Full stop. I would seriously consider your relationship with him. 
"Unless you've been around them both 24/7 since the day she was born, no, you don't know."

"I don’t think it’s smart to ask for marijuana-related advice on this sub, as this place seems like an extremely biased echo chamber when it comes to  drug users. 

I would never assume a dog would eat all my weed. It seems possible to me that the first time the Tupperware was left open, and the second time it was closed. If that’s the case, I’d say the roommates learned from their mistake and exercised reasonable care to avoid it. Waking them up and yelling at them, stealing their weed and throwing it away, and the various other extreme solutions proposed here would not benefit you. However, if it’s true that they went right back to storing the weed the exact same way they did before, then, yea, they’re fucking morons. I just don’t understand how the other commenters can so viciously condemn the roommates without all the details. Weed is expensive, these guys obviously do not want the dog to eat it."

"Well here is my question: what has your husband been doing to support you in all this? You had two children, his family is abusive to you, and you had PPD. Did you get treatment for that?

"This is not a good person to have children with. Children need flexible, kind, stable, emotionally intelligent parents. "
That's so fucking dumb. It's not clear cut like that. Yes she made the decision but she also took a leap of faith and risk out of love. The rules change when love is involved and yes you do need to care for other people's feelings regardless if they made a decision or not.
"She's been emotionally cheating on you dude and if she isn't willing to cut this guy off, move on. You have no reason to trust this girl at this point."
"WOW, okay.  This is important.  I totally understand why you didn't include it in your post, though.

I just did a little digging; I can't include links due to subreddit rules, but I did go to the US Passport website along with some others that had info specifically for felons who are no longer incarcerated, so here's a summary: If he has an outstanding arrest warrant, owes more than $2500 in child support, or owe the government money in the form of a certain type of loan he is temporarily barred from getting a passport.  If he's still on probation, he may be barred by his probation conditions from getting a passport.  The only offense I can find that would ban him from getting a passport for life would be if he were convicted of international drug trafficking (for obvious reasons).

According to what I found, the Bahamas will allow convicted felons in as long as they have no outstanding warrants (and, of course, as long as they have a valid passport), so the visa component is not a problem."
"&gt; Even with therapy, I feel like most of it will be by denial (that it's ""not that bad"" or something like that) and some form of narcissistic excuses for myself.


That's really not how therapy works. The idea is that you come to terms honestly with what you did, and learn how to move past it and be better in the future. 


You seem to have some really toxic ideas about sexuality and relationships that led you to make bad decisions. It's not about redemption, or excuses, it's about healing yourself and preventing future bad decisions. "
"I imagine this bride not hearing any pushback from her incredibly rude move... and then being that person giving advice on a forum, saying ""I invited guests to just the ceremony and not the reception, and it turned out totally fine! Go for it!""

You gotta get your son out of there.  
"They don’t make him out to the the bad guy, he *is* the bad guy. He is sexually and emotionally abusive, and may one day start hitting you as well. 

&gt;This whole conversation makes me feel like that perhaps this whole time we have been together, maybe I am too weak or something and he trying to make me tougher.

Quite the opposite. He is doing these things to you to make you weaker and less likely to stand up for yourself against him. To be tough and strong you need confidence in yourself, and that is fostered by encouragement, positivity and respect. He is showing you disrespect, manipulation and negativity to hurt your self-esteem and make you less likely to either challenge him or leave him."
"&gt; I'm actually the one who pays the bills and maintains the budget

No surprises there. Is there any chance you could teach him some money literacy and how to balance the family budget? Actually seeing where the money comes and goes might get some sense into him. 

But I agree with another poster: this kind of dreamer thing is incurable. My Dad was forever chasing get-rich-quick schemes. When I got older, he started trying to push them on to me and my sister so we could get rich on his behalf (""hey, your cat is pretty cute. Have you considered putting it on YouTube so it could go viral like Grumpy Cat? You could make so much money!""). Even in his 60's, he's trying to chase down be-your-own-boss, get-rich-quick schemes, whilst living in his girlfriends apartment whilst she pays for everything."
"Yeah no he's being an idiot IMO. That's sort of the point lol. Apparently it's embarrassing to be quiet, but not to be drunk crying and catty. "
"&gt;I feel like me and him have to sit down and talk things through

Um, you already did that. He told you what he wanted, you told him what you wanted, and then he told you what you wanted to hear and did what he wanted anyway.

Your bf wants to have sex with other people. He is plainly unwilling to be monogamous, and you won't change that. Either come to peace with the fact that he will continue this behaviour and lie about it, or cut your losses."
How long did you spend shading the upper lip? 
"agreed. The poster here is worried that having his SO around will get in the way of his career/profession. That mentality will be insidious in any long relationship. Boundaries are fine, and maybe she'll sit this one out and be cool about it, but I suggest you try to find a way to get over your stage fright in front of your SO/family. Seems like your problem, not hers.... her jealousy on social media has nothing to do with this. She should be allowed to share your success with you if you are to be life long partners. Just a thought...  "
"I essentially think there is no reason to ever yell at your partner like you're describing. The circumstances absolutely do not matter. Maybe it's not an irrevocable deal breaker, proceed directly to divorce, if it happens once or twice, but he should be proactively seeking you out and apologizing for doing it. You are not describing a person doing that, in fact, he isn't apologizing when you're asking for an apology. Time to leave."
"Honestly, I’d be shocked. I don’t mean that in a mean way, but she’s quite ‘proper’ and I just can’t imagine she’d be doing that. Admittedly, she may feel the same way about me not being that kind of person. Would I be hurt? Honestly, I guess so."
Did you actually read the post? Because it seems pretty obvious she's not on a keto diet. 
"This is the definition of a nice guy. They think that being nice- the most basic of good human interaction, expects a woman to drop her panties. It's just sad, really. "
"Your husband is hurting. I hear you are hurt too that he doesn't understand your motives, but actions speak louder then words. You can't just tell him you love him you have to show him. Show him you love him by finding a way to work on the things in your relationship that make him unhappy and feel unloved. You don't have to completely change who you are but you should be willing to compromise some.

&gt;I go out with my friends. I don't put as much money into our new house as him because he makes more than me and has big bonuses. I couldn't tell you the percentages of our income that we put in.

It isn't about percentages, that wouldn't be fair with you guys making different amounts. But it sounds like he feels you get to spend money on fun stuff while he stresses out to pay for the house. He doesn't feel like he can spend money on fun stuff because he's worried about money. Work out a financial plan together where the two of you contribute all your income to a joint account, and you each get $x per month to spend on fun things. That way it is fair. Do a budget and make sure this leaves enough money towards everything else (including retirement, financial goals you are saving towards) that you both feel comfortable. Look at how long it will take to save the money for the house and other goals. (Do you want to have children?) You may also want to consider if the house the two of you are saving up for is something you both want given it's cost. Would your rather look for something cheaper? If you want that priced house would you be willing to cut back on some of your fun money spending? Once you budget you may find out he spends a lot less on himself then you do or that you spend less then he assumed. It will help make things objective and clear. 

&gt;My libido is much lower than his, so no, I don't initiate sex.

I can understand this but I think it would really help if you did initiate on some occasions. Otherwise, he may not feel you desire him or find him attractive at all. Maybe initiate once a month or every other week? How often would you feel comfortable with? Just give it a try! Plan a romantic date for the two of you or a special day together or something and come on to him. I know this might take some getting used to but it will show him that even if you don't want sex as much as he does you still want him. You don't have to make a bit thing of it every time but I think planning a romantic date and sex for the two of you would really show him you are listening and working on his concerns. I can understand falling into the pattern where the higher libido partner always initiates but since you now know that makes him feel bad you can choose to break that pattern. 

&gt;I go out with my friends. [...] After work when I get home, I do want to have alone time, and I don't want him latched onto me constantly. I do tell him this every so often.

How often do you go out with your friends compared to your husband? (Not just spend time with, go out.) He mentioned going on trips with your friends, how long are these and how do they compare to how often you spend the same amount of time with your husband or go on trips with him? I understand you see him every day and you have to go out to see your friends, but just being in the same room isn't the same as quality time. When you go out with someone you arent' distracted and doing your own thing like much of the time at home. It is time you are focused on being social or on some fun shared activity. This sort of quality time is important. Also, when you do something different then what you do every day it is more memorable and impactful emotionally. So the same amount of time going out and doing something together tends to stay in our mind more and thus impact our happiness more. 

You can have quality time at home with your husband too. If you need a bit of time to recharge after work, that's fine. But then try to come back and spend some time fully present with your husband too. So maybe take 30 minutes to yourself alone when you get home from work and then have dinner together with no tv or cell phones just talking at the table? Maybe try and do something with him most evenings, even if it's brief. But make it time where you pay attention to him and touch him. Cuddle him, ect even if you don't have sex. You can show affection without it being sex. Maybe you could make a point of greeting him with a kiss and hug when he gets home and/or one of you leaves for work? Even if you then go back to do something else. 

I think setting up a weekly date night (with no being on your phone) would go a long way towards him feeling loved romantically and paid attention to. Even if you don't have sex each time you can spend time together, pay attention to him, cuddle up to him, lean on his shoulder, hold his hand while you walk, ect. And really make a point of spending some time together each day where you really pay attention to and engage with him. (Also track your time out and trips with him vs your friends. Obviously you shouldn't give up your friends, but your husband should be getting quality time with you too.) "
"I disagree.  While I understand I am in the minority, I do not approve of white lies for the exact circumstances that happened here - her feelings were hurt, and his response, instead of ""sorry"" was ""your feelings are abnormal"".  There's no compassion in that.  I think people who tell a lot of white lies often do it because they were taught it was the polite thing to do or to avoid conflict, not because they are truly considering the other person's feelings.  Her feelings respond better to truth; he should respect that.  That is the caring thing to do."

"Looking at OP's other comments, her sister strictly keeps the dog indoors and in a fenced yard; The dog is even sedated when brought to the vet.

OP went to her sister's house, was explicitly warned on how NOT to treat the dog, and did it anyways.

Depending on the state's laws, the dog may not be deemed responsible due to OP's awareness of the situation as well as her carelessness that factored into her injury."
"You know your mom is a pain to deal with, you know your wife is upset and stressed because she's having to deal with your mom, and you know you have the money for daycare.

I would leave the gym. Tell the manager he lost a customer. 
"It's passive-aggressive because it's paternalistic and a method of establishing a clear non-peer relationship.  OP's fiance is going to be their wife, and is an adult.  They're putting her in a position where she is referring to them as a child would.  I think their excuse that it's a tradition is bunk, if no one else in the family does it and none of the other people OP knows that are part of the culture do it.  It's cover for something else.

Now, they don't have to like fiance, but this isn't just some polite disagreement over names.  This is a proxy thing.  "
"&gt; the sod has always been a spoiled brat 

Whatever you do, stick to your guns. If your parents try to dissuade you from pressing charges because it will ruin little brother's life or some nonsense like that, forge ahead anyway - if he's sheltered and coddled then this might be a good slap in the face to wake him up to reality, as well as a way to reverse what's been done to you.

"Exactly. If it is no big deal and you did nothing wrong then when you come home you say, “Hey babe, so the trip was fun but so-and-so did something super awkward.” Then explain what happened.

I don't feel it's stupid to be offended. She probably feels that referring to them this way creates distance. That they're strangers rather than family.

"Oh wow, I feel for you and your husband. Pets, no matter their size, shape or form, can be so meaningful to us humans. 

I love and miss my rabbit (the first ever ""own"" pet I got, after wanting a rabbit all my life) every day and I honour his memory by talking about him to our other rabbits. One of them knew him, the other came as his ""replacement"".  I tell them about how they resemble his behaviour, or how Victor would like to join in on that lettuce, and all that jazz. It helps me cope in a way, it helps me deal with it being perfectly normal that pets pass on and are missed, even if other humans don't always understand how deep it goes.

You’d be frustrated too if people were giving you advice based on baseless assumptions. 
"I’m a criminal defense attorney. If I witnessed a hit-and-run, I also would have stayed to give a statement to the police. "
I agree it CAN work but I'm automatically leery. Age gaps aren't necessarily a bad thing on their own but it's soooo easy for an abusive person to take advantage of it.
She's also moving her entire life while he didn't have to take any risk.  I think asking him to support her for a few months is a small thing in the grand scheme of things.
"I would love to know what his post was before he deleted it, purely based on your amazing ass handing comment alone."
Absolutely.  I feel like Im in the Twilight Zone scrolling through this thread.  Why on earth should the parents be granted instant respect that the fiance is not?  Because they are old and birthed a child?  Ridiculous!
"What about the fiance's culture?  What about respecting her as an equal, as an adult person?"
Your wife sounds like an asshole
"we do split the time evenly. You don’t have any idea what our lives are like based on this post. This post is describing a situation that I needed advice on. 
One night I stay up all night with him, the next night she stays up all night with him.

She was at her dads because she asked me if she could go and take him with her for the night. 

I work two part time jobs, take summer college classes, and I still make sure that I’m putting in 100% to helping with our child especially because she has depression and anxiety. I’m doing anything but judging her condition I’ve worked really hard to help extra because of her condition. Your comment is ignorant"
"There's a lot to unpack here.

First and foremost, as another poster noted, you twice mention killing yourself or not wanting to live. I'm sorry you are feeling so down, but I urge you to reach out for help if that's how you are feeling. You are valuable, your life is valuable, and there are people out there who will help you. Please, reach out to someone today.

You make some assertions about genetically lucky people that are not necessarily true, but it belies your anger and frustration about your current situation. Although it might not appear this way to you, beautiful people have problems, too, and they can experience heartbreak and singledom as well.

You mention being unattractive and chubby. I feel you! I have been overweight since high school (I'm 33 now) and I don't have what most would consider a traditionally attractive face or body. Huge nose, bad skin, frizzy hair...oh, and I'm shorter than the national average, too. Although I have been working on my weight and appearance for the last few years, I'm still fat and short.

Despite that, I manage to have success with women.

I don't mean to say this to rub it in your face, but to let you know that the thing in your way is perhaps not your appearance, but your attitude.

Since we're both not CK models, let me ask you: What do you bring to the table as far as dating is concerned? What do you have to offer a potential date? Aside from looks, why would someone be interested? What are your hobbies and interests? How are your communication skills? Are you funny? Do you have good stories? Are you kind, conscientious, and caring? I mean, I don't know you at all, so you tell me!

There are two keys to dating when you're not an 7/10 or above: confidence and communication skills. Fortunately, both are things that you can work on in your spare time.

(conversely, the two things that make even the hottest dudes unattractive are a lack of confidence and poor communication skills)

I built my confidence by exercising and getting really good at my job and hobbies. Took a lot of work and time to feel good about myself, but once I did, the rejections stopped hurting so much and I was not as desperate for female attention. When I wasn't desperate, I was less anxious an more assured, and women started noticing me more. I also practiced talking to women without trying to get a date or a phone number, literally just had nice, brief conversations with nothing else. After a while, I learned how to pick up on body language, facial expressions, and to listen\-\-really listen\-\-to the words women used to gain clues into their personalities and interests. I gradually learned how to make people laugh, the right amount/kinds of questions to ask, and the best stories to tell.

Once I felt confident in myself and my ability to communicate, my whole world changed and I finally started having success with women. I also realized that I am not **owed** a date or a relationship, just because others have them. I have to earn those things by practicing kindness and consideration, and although my work is cut out for me because of my physical appearance, that doesn't mean I won't make it work with the right person.

So, again, I ask you: what about you is unique and desirable to women? Let's start there."
This is great advice. I’d just like to add that you say you are afraid of being hurt again - but he’s hurting you right now. 
"I think it's a big deal \- if OP doesn't want her minor child's photos all over the internet (also I'm pretty sure that once you post a pic on FB, then FB owns that picture?) that's a valid concern and a very valid boundary. If I have children I will not let random relatives post pictures publicly of them online and that's something that I would be willing to burn bridges over because I think that children have a right to privacy, and parents should enforce what ever privacy boundaries they find appropriate."
"He only came crawling back because his fling dumped him. He’s unwilling to do the bare minimum, which is acknowledging what he did and apologizing. He didn’t just dump you for a younger woman; he tried to destroy your livelihood. He let you get evicted. He tried to take your son away.

He is not a good man. Please go to therapy solo and work on your self-esteem. You don’t deserve this loser."
"&gt;&gt; My mom is retired, which is why my wife slightly pointed out that since mom stays home all day she could at least make an effort and not serve us pre-cooked food or basic stuff.

Your wife is being an asshole. Sharing a meal with family or friends is about *sharing the meal*, not some stupid competition about who puts forth more effort. If someone cooks for you, you say thank you and leave it at that; it's just rude to carp because the food isn't up to your standards.

But you said that your parents ""insist"" that you visit at least once a month, so perhaps your wife is sick of that expectation and it's coming out as criticism of your mom's food."
"Honestly you're trippin dude. That's the kind of thing you clarify befofe marriage. Look, I get it. I like to lift, I follow bodybuilding routines and diets. I want my SO to be fit. That's why I'm dating someone who's strict with her diet and lives to workout. You can't be married for 15 years and then decide you'd like your wife to be the epitome of fitness for her age. That's an incredible amount of change you're asking for. You can move on and find someone who matches your aesthetic desires, or you can accept the woman you married for who she is. If you keep this up, she's gonna move on and find someone who doesn't make her feel like shit about herself. "
"Stop acting like you are just a bystander in your own life. You can't control other people, you can only control your own actions. Time to change your perspective or get out of the marriage."
"I'm surprised that sister was allowed to adopt a dog with aggressive tendancies. As far as I was aware dogs went through behaviour testing and had to pass before being adopted out.

Obviously, we don't know what OP did to trigger the dog but this wasn't a fear 'bite and run' panic response, this was a sustained attack resulting in multiple bites. Absolutely the law would take this one on. A judge isn't going to wave it off. A dog with documented aggression issues attacks a human? Euthanasia. 

Don't get me wrong, I feel bad for the dog and OP both. But feeling sorry for the dog doesn't change anything."
"&gt; This is not in your control long-term; it is in your child’s control.

Well, it *should* be, at least.

I was the child in this situation, and I always held the believe that my grandfathers new gf/wife that he got after my grandmother left him when my mother was 17 was in no way my ""grandmother"". Not because I had the ""real"" one (she died when I was very young), or because I didn't like her (I like her just fine), but just because she wasn't. She was never my mothers mother, or stepmother, they never lived together, there was no parenting of a minor happening.

*However*, my mother disagrees and regards this (lovely, actually) woman as her mother. And that's fine. That's up to her. So, I was always told that I have to accept her as my grandmother, name and all. My mother still does this, and looks all hurt when I refuse, now that I'm in my thirties.

OP's kid will have some thought about this (or not), and their preference should be acknowledged when they're older."
"That's honestly a hard line for most people. Don't tolerate that shit, it's so rude and disrespectful to your entire relationship that he's been doing this for so long without changing. If he hasn't stopped by now, he won't stop, and even if he /doesn't/ physically cheat, I would honestly consider the personal image use as a big enough breach of faithfulness to be borderline cheating, and definitely breakup worthy."
"&gt;I currently run a business that drains me (I work 80 hours a week) even though I enjoy it. I am a freelance designer on the side with small projects I do often

So is the goal to keep working 80 hours a week, just have it feel less draining?"
"Based on your comment history, I think him dying at 50 would be the best possible thing to happen to you. He sounds horrible. "
"I like how they always gloss over details like this or save it for the comments. 

Like here are some red flags are they red flags?and also here’s a throwaway line about something that doesn’t seem like a big deal to me but is most definitely also a red flag."
"Which sounds like the worse story to tell people:

1) the above mentioned really scary stuff and noped back home.

2) I found the above mentioned really scary stuff but stayed because I didn't want to look like I made a mistake (that's why I'm currently in hospital with stab wounds)

If you honestly believe you are unsafe, leave."

"Good management is knowing when to delegate.

"This relationship has become toxic. Your girlfriend doesn't respect you, and seems to get a kick out of belittling you in public in front of others- that's abusive."
"He's been doing all the cooking and most of the cleaning. He's also been doing all the physical side of the renovations and most of the planning for most of the projects.

"Dude, you’re posting in other subs about stealing from your dad and lying to your mother to get more money to give this woman after blowing everything your uncle gave you for your education on her instead.

"Pretty sure there are free ones online too (Duolingo). Can't speak to how useful they are, but there isn't a lack of accessible resources."

"What the actual fuck dude...


First of all, don't think about marriage that early. It's just going to end badly. And second, tell your parents to change the god damn code of your house and cut your ex out of your life. She is acting inappropriate and is just a whiny brat, you don't need to be friends with a person like that. Just don't. Leave her rotting in the dust and have a happy relationship with Ppg."
I've been with my husband for 7 years and I've use his name so little that it feels weird to call him that.
"Wait, does she live at home with her parents? "
"I think this is what I struggle with most. You can’t have it both ways. He likes to use them together and he likes to hear about me using them on my own, but sometimes it pisses him off. And he gets insecure. And I don’t know when that’s going to happen, so I just choose to never talk to him about it at all. And I know that’s not healthy either."
"This is very good advice in general. Yes, it's creepy that they went through 4 years of posts, but that's the risk you take when you keep your social media public. "

"&gt;my friend was saying he could be friends with one of the bar tenders and this could be a way they drug women 

I feel like this is PROBABLY not something you need to worry about. Is it possible? Sure. Is it likely? Probably not. 

If I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, I think he probably likes drinking, feels more relaxed when he's drinking, and thinks this bar specifically will make him look cool in some way (maybe he wants to be the kind of guy that takes a girl to a divey place and impresses her with how cool and out-of-the-way it is?) and he thinks that's a good vibe for a first date. The suggestion of the semi-creepy bar or wanting to go to a bar at all isn't, to me, a red flag.

But uh.... his INSISTENCE that you go there, and his overlooking the fact that you're not interested in going there IS a red flag. Or at least an orange one. If someone on their very best behavior (like we are around first-date time) doesn't respect your boundaries, they're not gonna get BETTER over time.

I would text him and say ""hey I'm sorry but I'm going to have to cancel. Thanks"". And then tell your friend who set you up ""he just wasn't really respectful of my boundaries and it gave off bad vibes.

Your instinct to trust your gut here is a good one. Even if he's harmless, you don't need to do things that make you uneasy. There are plenty of folks out there who are respectful and not looking to start a relationship on unequal footing."
"I mean, you already talked to a friend about this and he agreed it was a red flag. The fact that you're taking the time to write all this out and get even more agreement about how weird this guy's boundary-stomping is before you decide it's okay to give up, is a bit concerning.

Okay, so you're looking to ""not misunderstand"" anyone. He's 
*probably* not looking to rape you (but you still shouldn't ignore that possibility). Maybe he just has social anxiety and feels uncomfortable with the idea of being sober for a first date. Doesn't matter - you've made your preferences clear and he's still pushing. If he needs to be in a bar to date and you need to not be, you're not a good match anyway."
"Or live her own life and let her mother die alone, because she disowned all her children due to her bullshit racist attitude. Serves her right.


I'm probably in the minority, but I don't care if a stranger, friend of family shows a shitty attitude. They get cut out of my life!"
Taking photos of strangers' asses to j/o to later is next-level creep. If all guys were *that* creepy I wouldn't be able to leave the house! Trust that this one's certainly a bad egg.
Thank you! I’ve cross posted

"Set some time aside to do some research on the Internet about how to introduce teenagers, especially boys, to a sex-positive view of sex education and porn, especially one that looks at porn from a female perspective. Also, introduce him to the broader subject of relationship education especially from the perspective of respect for teenage girls and women. It may not be the way that you would have wanted to introduce it or the time, but it should have been on the agenda anyway and you can't avoid it now if that was ever a thought going through your head. So, it has it's positive aspects. He needs to understand that sex is not about holes and poles but about people. Introduce him to written sources of sex-positive porn as well as graphic sources. Seek out sources of real people talking about real sex including the problems and relationship challenges involved."
"That's even more of a reason to distance yourself... she's manipulating you into staying around and letting her bolster her ego by making you feel like trash. Whether you're her only friend or not doesn't matter because doesn't she doesn't treat you as a friend.

"You both already had dinner together. I don't get why she *had* to come with you. Getting angry about it, is ridiculous I think. You're hungry, you're an adult, deal with it. Your girlfriend doesn't have to come with you. "
Don't date people who would exile you from bed if they disapprove of your behavior. This is controlling behavior 101. I wouldn't be surprised if it escalates over time.
"Curious, why not just an MBA then? Less debt, time, and stress. As someone very familiar with Silicon Valley I’ve never heard of a firm preferring an MBA/JD over a top ranked MBA (preferably with a technical undergrad)."

"I agree with the counseling. However, I would try a few different ones until you find one that both of you can agree on. There are some counselors that will favor the wife's or the husband's point of view and that won't do any good for the two of you. "
" I can't imagine what you're going through its clear from your post how much you love your kids, and how much you love your sister and you want to leave everyone in a situation where they will be happy and ok. Initially its going to be really really difficult, and whatever choice you make for them will be hard in its own way. I'm not a parent myself but I imagine that all you want is for you children to go on after your death and be happy, successful, well-adjusted members of society. These are decisions that no one should have to make and from the bottom of my heart I'm sorry you have to make them. 

From my own experience I can tell you that not a day goes by where I don't think of my mom.  I miss her like crazy and wish more than anything that she was here to enjoy my life with me and see me succeed but at the end of the day I am happy, successful and I am *okay* without her and your kids will be too.  Humans are resilient and it sounds like you raised two amazing kids. I'm glad you're thinking proactively and logically to set them up nicely, talking to the right people but once you make all those decisions please enjoy time with your two kiddos. 

You're trying to see every option, thinking a million miles a minute but you can't and won't ever be able to factor in the future and the choices other people will make. Your sister may find a job she loves thats better for her in California, your kids may move to Delaware, hate it, and your son goes back to college in California and your daughter goes to boarding school (New England or elsewhere), your kids may love Delaware and never want to leave. Whatever happens they need a safe person to be their base to look out for them, both emotionally and financially. 

Grief brings people together in a way I can't explain, and your kids and your sister will be both be grieving and they'll be grieving the same person which will make the bond stronger. Bring them together in their grief, it'll help everyone. Your children are going to miss you more than anything, but they'll find a new normal and they'll be alright , I promise. I know on one hand it seems cruel but knowing the end is near is a luxury in its own way.  Maybe you can write each of them a little journal of memories you have of them when they were small, silly happy stories that only you know, things you notice about them now that you love, stories about their mom only you know, just really personal stories and tidbits. "
"This is not about your kids being capable of paying the bills on their own. Your kids are going to need emotional support. And a place to land for the rest of their lives. For the love of god, tell them what's going on so they can choose to spend more time with you and perhaps have a say in terms of who will be there for them when you can't. "
"I agree, as some one who had two older teen guys move into my house that my step dad tried to present ""like brothers"" when i was your daughters age, its horrible. I was a depressed 14 year old who cut, and they both took advantage of me and manipulated me into doing what they wanted sexually. A girl that young who just lost her dad is going to be even more vulnerable to men taking advantage of her because she will likely unconsiously look for bonding and comfort from men. 
"
"Listen. This man is abusive. I've been in your position with someone very similar. Leave him. Now. I know your anxiety is likely going to paralyze you and keep you from doing so, but please fight through it, for your sake and your child's.

My current spouse also has a low libido. He is bipolar type 2 with anxiety and mostly depressive states. I'm the high libido with cyclothymia and frequent hypomania that leads to hypersexuality. But you know what? I NEVER force my husband to do anything sexual he ever wants to do. It can be frustrating but out of love and respect for him and his disorder, I do not ever want him to feel pressured. And I certainly don't tell him to fuck off. Leave this man ASAP."
"No she didnt mislead him she has a budget sticks to it. She worked overtime to cover date nights and vacations but he didnt want that.

Its a lifestyle difference."
I thought he 100% disinvited himself on the spot with that.
I've never wanted to invite a stranger to leave their life and come live as long as they need in my guest room more than I do right now.

"While there’s nothing wrong with what’s she’s doing with her money she wasn’t really honest about it. I think OP would feel differently if the girlfriend had said from the start I’m trying to pay off my loans as quick as possible so I can’t afford to do X,Y,Z thing. I’m sure op would have still helped pay for things but saying you’re paying your loans off is very different to saying I have no money and am too poor.

This post is confusing because most people don't take time off from work, make concrete plans to catch an overseas festivals etc **without having the actual plane tickets booked!**

And why is it that OP and her boyfriend just caught on that nothing has been booked *two weeks* before they were due to leave? If I'm going on an international trip **the first thing I need booked/confirmed are the plane tickets, because that's how you lock in that you're actually going somewhere!** We live in the age of airbnb and online booking sites, so you can sort out accommodations on the fly -- but you need the damn tickets before you start taking time off work and planning what activities on specified dates you're going to do!

This whole thing is ass backwards, so that's why it's confusing as fuck to many posters! I don't consider a trip set until plane tickets are purchased, otherwise dates of travel are not fixed and you might not be able to afford the dates you wanted!"

You beat it, you're one of the lucky ones look at her check ups as a moment of pride for you and for her. Addiction kills so many people every day but not you because of you wanting to beat it and because of her a Mothers love is a powerful thing man. So next time she comes around be proud to show her ""Nope no marks on me"" this is a good thing like everyone else is saying here she just wants to be sure when she wants to see her child she can go see you and not a plot of grass and a stone. 

   Keep going strong and one year will soon be ten but make no mistake its a disease that you are never cured of it is a fight that you have to wake up every day and punch it in the mouth everytime it pops it ugly fucking head up and believe me I am 6 years in and some days are worse than others but he tries to wiggle back into my life and I don't let it but I believe you have the strength and love and support to win that fight.

"This is a line of bullshit. 

She lost him as a friend the moment she started to having feelings for him. I speak from experience here, as I have used that line myself. No, she does not want his friendship. She wants to have her cake and eat it, too. She wants the flirtation and the gazing and the attention when she is with him, and then wants to come home and play house with you. She can't be ""just friends"" with him now. She fucked that up. 

You need to have a strong backbone here, my friend. If you want to save this relationship, tell her in no uncertain terms to drop this guy. Like, yesterday. You cannot work on repairing your relationship with him in the background. "

""You know you're an awesome, attractive person.  Stop it. I'm tired of hearing your s***.  From now on, I'm going to just agree with every ridiculous thing you say so you can hear how you sound."" From then on:

Me: ""I'm fatttttttt and terrible ughh.""

Him: ""Yeah, you really are a house. You could have your own zipcode. I'll call a crane to lift you out of your chair."""
"I mean, it honestly sounds like he’s causing the issues. If he’s going to refuse counseling and is willing to drive you into poverty to maintain his drug habits then yeah, you should leave him. "
He doesn’t hate it. He’s probably barely passing and doesn’t think he can get a law job. So he’s rejecting it before it can reject him. 
"It took 6 years of lying for her guilty conscience to kick in.  
How are you going to be able to **trust the rest of your life** in this woman's hands? She's disloyal.  

I'd cancel the wedding ASAP so that you don't get pressured into making the wrong decision. Then I'd be honest with her. You can't see her the same way you used to with this new information and your trust in her has been broken. Unless something dramatically changes in the relationship, it doesn't make sense for you two to remain engaged.  

I honestly wouldn't recommend staying with a woman like this. She's capable of constantly lying to you so **how can you trust that suddenly she's telling the 100% truth?**"
"I'm a woman who does not find thick arms/shoulders attractive at all. Everyone has different things they find attractive. 

Anyway, maybe she's insecure about her own appearance and feels like you're ""outdoing"" her? "
"Think of it from your MIL perspective. Just because she is 60, doesn't mean she doesn't have or want a life that doesn't always include you. Still, out of love, from her perspective she helps you cook, clean and even helps w your sick baby. She invites you to her house for a couple of weeks and get this, even gets up in the middle of the night to pick up your crying child because he is crying and maybe to let you sleep. She sounds like she is coming from a place of goodness and here you are all angry and fuming. Communication is desperately needed. The first year having a baby is rough, sleep deprivation can make you crazy. You are not thinking clearly. How is she supposed to know she is doing anything ""wrong""?"
"For what it's worth, I don't agree with the comments that are implying that this is your fault. If he was angry or upset by your pranks then, as an adult, he should have communicated with you about it. No matter his intentions, it doesn't justify how he acted, and the fact that he seems to think that they're equivalent is a big problem, to say nothing of the fact that if he was retaliating then it shows a side of him that is malicious and lashing out. "
"10 month olds are infants.  They aren't manipulative.  Very few sleep through the night.  Is it possible that you aren't meeting his needs?  He isn't happy waking up 13 times a night, either.  He's not doing that because he finds it fun to make your night miserable.

He may be in pain from teething.  He may have tummy upset from different food on vacation.  He may be having trouble sleeping in a place he isn't familiar with.  He may be having trouble handling the routine changes that happen on vacation.

He's an infant.  He's not messing with you.  He's needing you."
"You’re setting yourself up to raise two children, OP."
OP admitted that she is not a strict Muslim in the original post. She also said in a comment that she would be willing to bring up the child with both religions and let them decide when they’re older. The question isn’t asking if you think the way she’s following her religion is right or not. The question is asking how to have this conversation with her boyfriend who refuses to listen.
"That church requirement is good to know, actually, thank you!"
"Don't listen to this guy. We don't know why she was in that mood, but what she did was absolutely unacceptable. There was no communication error here, there was just her bigass frackup.

I hope you take the advice of the one friend who saw the entire thing. At this point, if I were you I'm not sure I'd be able to trust her with my safety anymore. "
"No shit, I can't believe some of the crap I am reading in here today."
"It doesn't really matter what it'll look like to others, it's your life. That being said, do you want to get back together? She's been irrationally jealous for 2 years now and it led to her breaking up with you while making false accusations. What makes you think it'll be any different/better now?"
"&gt;at about the one year mark in relationships, where basically she gets either bored or too afraid of commitment and eventually ends it before being unfaithful to the other person

Not girlfriend material. Immature, selfish. Move on before you waste more time unless you, yourself, are genuinely into the idea. Do not do it just to keep her."
"Right?  I have 3 kids, and stayed with friends or family with all 3.  No way would I have subjected any of them to cry it out.  And I remember MANY nights with the last one, holding him, rocking him, or rubbing his back for perhaps hours until he was out.  Or just letting him wear himself out, to sleep.

Kid is definitely not going to settle down in an unfamiliar place anyway.  2 weeks and then back home?  I'm not even sure CIO would be recommended under this schedule.  Might as well be flexible.

Or again, just go home.  Is your husband helping put the baby down?"
Have you talked to him
"Nah. It would have been brave when she did it. They were dating for 9 months and he could have easily (and probably would have) walked away. Now that he’s invested it’s harder for him to do that. She knows this. I guess she wasn’t feeling guilty enough when she was just hiding infidelity from a boyfriend. When it’s a fiancé then the guilt was too much. Honestly the only one she’s doing a favor here is herself, as this confession 6 yr after the fact is completely selfish.   If she honestly changed as a person, then this should have been her cross to bear. She should never have mentioned it. You can argue she’d be taking the choice away from him should he want to leave, but he’s invested enough here that that choice may not even exist. "
"Thank you for sharing this. Without going into too much detail, I have seen a lot of similar things and I agree with what you said. Wishing peace for you and your family."
"The reality of it is, that all communities have some rotten eggs. You just happen to know one of them, sadly. And this rotten egg wants to get with a good chicken. Please warn the chicken before it gets spoiled."
"It’s a photo, dude, she didn’t sign you up for a social media account with your personal info and force you to use it. I’m incredibly camera shy but forcing a family member to remove an innocuous photo showing you two having fun and being together is a bridge too far even for me. IMO your sister was expressing herself a little immaturely but like the top comment says I don’t think she was actually whining about losing likes, she was trying to point out that people liked seeing you both. "
OR you could break up and get rid of that giant millstone around your neck.
Her commitment is NOT to the training or the gym. It’s to this dude. If he weren’t her partner I doubt she’d be going at all.
He's fine with prenatals because those don't get you pregnant and they make you feel like he's making progress. 
"I would leave the nest if i were you and never look back. Also,i feel. r/raisedbynarcissist may be one you can also ask for help from"
"&gt; I don't want to hurt the relationship

She does."
It’s almost 6 am here and I’m hoping she’s already done it. 
"&gt; I never once told her that I think she's incredibly beautiful, or that from my perspective, every single thing about her is perfect, and that I want nothing more in the world than to be with her

Because those things would be *crazy* to say. You're not in love, you're just infatuated and pining. You gotta walk it way back. If you were to express interest in someone (not her obviously) then you'd need to start with ""hey, I feel like we connect well and was wondering if you want to get coffee this weekend?"" 

&gt; Is there something I could say to her?

Nope, keep it to yourself and move on.

&gt;Then that ruins the chance of her considering me if she ever breaks up with her bf, sometime in the future

You need to stop being her ""friend"" if this is your line of thinking. "
"Tell your parents ASAP. 

THIS IS NOT OK"
"I actually understand how you feel, to some extent, because my husband's proposal to me was...underwhelming, to say the least. But truly, as time passes, the importance of this will fade SO MUCH. Now our proposal is a funny story, and my husband has come through in so many major ways, it pales in comparison. "
"Or you will just end up with a codependent and unhappy partner. In my opinion people who never compromise, aren't capable of being a good partner to anyone. I mean, possibly not you specifically,  but the counterpart that can handle that situation is a codependent person and often those relationships don't last if the codependent person goes to therapy or tried to deal with their issues. "
Yeah I’ll probably just have to keep ignoring her and reminding myself it’s for the best. 
"You should have never NEVER brought your child along to meet a stranger, and it is incredibly bad decision\-making that you integrated a stranger into your daughter's life so fast.  It is a MASSIVE red flag that he, with a decade of supposed experience on you, did not make better choices for his OWN child as well.

This man is not good news.  He is all talk and ZERO action when it comes to being sexually attracted to you.  I bet a whole lot of money he is either interested in your daughter and is trying to groom her, or he wants you to move in and be his housewife and mommy to his kid, without actually being a husband to you."
"Honestlyyyyy the ""we’re the best each other could do"" might be the worst bit. OP you’re so young and there is ABSOLUTELY someone better out there for you. 
"
"Seconding the opinions to propose in the first half of the trip. The longer you wait, the more anxious she’ll be and worried it’s not happening. If you propose in the first half (like day 2 or 3) then the anticipation is still there, it’s still a surprise because she didn’t know exactly when, and you can spend the rest of the trip in lovey, dovey celebratory bliss."
"What is it they call them now? Dependapotamous? TRICAREatops?

"
Yeah I think the silver lining here is that she got to see this side of him before they got married.
"Did you even bother to ask her if she’s interested in a necklace? Expectations arising from gifts only strengthen the assumption that you give gifts with strings attached. When you give a gift, you then let go of it, it is up to the recipient to do what they wish with it. While it was thoughtful and well-meaning of you, you are still basically trying to manipulate an outcome your gf does not desire. She doesn’t like jewelry? That’s actually great! It will save you money in the long run. "
It’s a child free wedding...what makes you think it would even be slightly appropriate to bring your child? Either find a babysitter or don’t go. 
"He shouted ""fuck you"" at her more than once, this isn't a single outburst. he also told her she should go off her medication that she NEEDS so he can have sex every day. "
"This is all brilliant advice. 

And just to keep your emotional tone with them level, remember that you are her guest, so it's not like she's required to have it be a certain experience for you.  Ideally yes, she'd be able to be a good hostess and all,  but in this case you do have the option of bailing, or going to a separate activity, or whatever you need to do to take care of yourself if it comes to that.    

Also if you'd like to help advocate for her in the future,  you could take the option of (subtly to document or obviously to deter - your choice) videoing his interactions with her if he starts to put her down, is doing shady stuff with other chicks, or if he's getting physically abusive.     "
"If there weren't choices for you on the way back, what made you think there were choices after going to the apartment and then back out again?"
"Yes, how dare we judge serial cheaters?

Or did you not get that out of ""she'd set up her next relationship while still in one""?

This is not a single girl going out partying."
"I came here to say ""don't introduce an SO to your young child until you're pretty sure you're going to get married"" so I'm glad someone else said it.

OP, he's protecting his child. What if she got attached to you and you guys broke up at like 8 or 9 months? 6 months of dating is not a lot at all. "
It sounds mostly like her not showing affection towards him at all. 
"Yeah, I suspect most people underestimate how unappealing a decade of bouncing from country to country makes them look to employers. Or how much of a financial disadvantage gallivanting around the world puts them...

Even if she does decide to settle down, OP might not be fine with having to support her while she repairs her career. "
"&gt; How does he rebuild my trust in him? 

He can't when he is STILL LYING TO YOU. Old posts my ass. When is the last time you/he took photos of you nude? Last few weeks? A month?

&gt; How can he prove that it only went as far as he says? 

See above. He's still lying.

&gt; How do I know that he hasn't hidden other things in the past, in fear, like he tried to this time? 

Same answer."
That’s exactly what being a parent means. OP’s bf is doing his son a massive disservice. 
"I can't even begin to wrap my head around this. How did either one of them think this was Ok and how weren't you included on this decision? I would be beyond livid! You live in an apartment? So for 10 days its you, boyfriend, 4 kids and his exwife? I have no advice besides find some place to stay for the next 10 days and deal with how inconsiderate this all was in 11 days. "
"I completely agree you shouldn't feel badly. Go to the family events and if your parents choose to boycott it is them missing out. Make sure you have good channels of communication with extended family that don't require your parents to let you know about events. Ask in advance before times you usually get together around the rest of the family ""what are we doing for x event""? Maybe you and your fiancee can organize some time with some of your family. You could invite your favorite aunt and uncle over for dinner, or take your grandmother to a movie or play she'd like, or whatever. If you want to be as unpetty as possible continue to give your parents friendly invites. This will also show them you don't need them to have relationships with your family and their threat isn't working.

That said, I would not tell your family  ""My mom is being completely insane and is boycotting this event over the dumbest shit ever,"" unless that just really fits the tone of your family and won't be an issue. Because by insulting your parents to the family when they aren't there, you are doing something ""bad"" when otherwise you are innocent and just your parents are causing an issue. I would either tell the truth in polite and disappointed fashion (though that might embrass your fiancee) or go with a ""you'll need to ask them that"" when asked why they aren't there. You don't need to be drawn into explaining or being a go between. If they want to boycott events over your fiancee's appearance you can leave them to try to explain to people why they aren't coming themselves. Them not coming doesn't have to be your problem to manage. Let them sit out and let them explain why. You and your fiancee just go and have fun and show them this isn't working. "
If your parents are too rich then you can’t get financial AID but I’m pretty sure you can still get student loans...? 
"But this particular poster clearly sees this as a warning sign. Her gut is telling her this is wrong, and she's second guessing herself. Her gut is right, and she should listen to it."
"so she doesnt want to lose him as a friend, and thats more important than losing you as a partner?"
"Well, you can go back to work while he takes on the homeschooling."
"You do need to choose your battles, and it might just be better to open a secret separate account that your mother doesn’t know about to keep your savings in and then add your mother to your current account. Never transfer money between the two accounts directly or she can see transfer records.

When you’re looking for post-college jobs be sure to look for ones that are several hours (ideally several states...) away from your mother. Once you’ve made the move you need to keep her on a strict information diet and generally limit her ability to influence your life."
She studied Tourism Management as shes only 22. Its in her field so yeah...
"Get out now. I caught similar messages on my partner's phone after a number of years together. I made excuses for him for it, and stayed. Again, and again. And again. 

It is not worth it. The pain of betrayal and resentment grows until it becomes unbearable. We're years in past you and your partner, and pretty much are now at the inevitable end of our relationship. Take it from someone who has been down this road: it is not worth it."
"I'm genuinely wondering- if OP were a man with a female fiancee, would they still care about his fiancee's unshaven legs? It's hard to tell whether this is homophobia or plain misogyny. Probably some combo of both. "
"&gt;I wonder what the possibility is that he's genuinely having a really bad time and he will be normal in the future?

Less than zero f*cking percent.

I was you at 22(F) with my ex husband (34). We were together 8 years. While he was never abusive (verbally or physically) he was a liar, a cheater and a thief that ruined me financially for years. 

OP, YOUR BF WILL NOT CHANGE.  Get the hell out now. Take it from someone who's been there. LEAVE. Take my word for it."
"You're allowed to dictate who is allowed in your home, just as he is allowed to date whoever he wants.  "
This breaks my heart.  I'm sorry you felt that way and went through that.
"And what kind of social circle lets that behavior happen in the first place?  The reality is that OP associates with and invites to his wedding catty mean girls that go out of their way to be nasty to the new GF.  I don't associate with people who act like this!  Add in, now that he knows about this, his attitude is that it's in the past so he can't do anything about it *now.*  That says *alot* about the underlying character of this social group.  "
"OP, please.  I wouldn't expect my partner to trust me either if my job required me to go to brothels and strip clubs all the time.  You made a really big omission in your OP.  Go fix it, right now.  

But, still, go to counseling.  Frankly, I don't think you should get married.  She's in a position where she probably feels like she can never truly trust you, and I don't blame her.  "
"Did she handle it properly? No. But like another commenter said: It’s not like Jess was invited on these couple dates or anything (was she? I may have missed it, and if she was, I’m sorry!). She was thrown into these big group events where everyone knew one another, everyone had jokes, everyone had memories, and she got a bunch of Mean Girls (not saying – at all – that EVERYONE from past life or friends of your fiancee’s were Mean Girls, and you know that, so please, don’t be obtuse), who would make catty comments and take small digs at her.

That hurts. And that adds up. And it spilled over at an inopportune moment. And, unfortunately, it may just be too far gone at this point for anyone to save."
when they are 8 years apart? I doubt it. He's at a point in his life where his career is probably starting to take off and she is barely starting college...that is not a good relationship dynamic at all
"You aren't married.  You're living with a guy who abuses you.  

Whether you stay in the relationship or not is your decision, but don't lie and pretend it's for your kids.  

Living in a one bedroom apartment isn't the worst thing that can happen to a kid.  Living in a place with people who are good role models on how they should be as future adults, and not abuse their girlfriends is more important than pretentious attitudes about their living situation.
"
"Under no circumstances should you bring the baby. This is the bride and groom a day and it is important to respect their wishes. I disagree with the poster who suggested having a babysitter at the wedding site. Just don't do it.

I agree that it makes the most sense for just your husband to go. If you both decide that no one should go, the bride and groom will understand. 

Unfortunately this is just how life changes after you have children. Sometimes you have to make compromised and do things separately, or not do them at all. His family will understand whatever decision you guys come to."
Which her? Your friend or your gf?
"You say yourself that you're falling in love with your female friend. If you were able to prioritize your gf, you would be willing and able to put the distance you need with your friend to focus on your gf. You clearly can't or don't want to do that, so you aren't prioritizing your relationship with her. And emotional cheating is still cheating. Stop making excuses. You're consciously making decisions to continue to betray your gf.  "
"&gt;I don’t know if you have a hard time accepting it, but you are honestly so pretty

I understand you're young and it's very cute but you still don't want to put her TOO much on a pedestal. I would leave it at ""You are honestly so pretty"""
"I’m so sorry, but I don’t have a nicer way of saying this. Your mother is emotionally abusing you. Google the cycle of abuse and do some reading.

You need to learn to keep her at a distance. You will never have a healthy relationship with her as long as she sees no problem with her behavior. She abuses you and your dad regularly, and it’s not okay. "
[removed]
"I think you are way too forgiving of sexual abuse and abuse in general. Also I feel like it's not even my family, because they have always made me feel like an outsider. Apart from my cousins and grandma, they don't show me love, unlike my real family back in Europe. My dad even said he doesn't trust his own family, it's pretty sad. I havve a hard time forcing myself to hang around people who have hurt me, I don't understand why you would force yourself to be around your abusers. Also my granddad and dad (step dad) have always had a strained relationship, because he used to beat my grandma. I *really* don't consider him a person worthy of respect. Thank you though, I do appreciate the ""forgive and never forget notion"""
Man if the venue is willing to cancel it probably means they'll get at least some deposits back. If I were her I would take that and run. No way the parents will pay more for anywhere else.
Have you tried asking him *why* he wants to murder you? Maybe this is all a misunderstanding. 
"Yeah, she was outside crying because she THINKS her bf is cheating and then she turns around and does it FOR SURE.

Best case scenario, shee was overwhelmed and made a mistake, she regrets it and comes clean to him - but I am also leaning towards her using you to get back at her bf and her being a shitty person overall.

In a way, you used her in her vulnerable moment just as much, even though she initiated. You could've said no.

If she was serious about you (and, well, you about her) you would've waited until after she broke up with him."
"I’ve lost four friends this goddamn month to that same story. OP, I get the boundary stomping sucks, but a year isn’t a long time in the grand scheme of things with heroin and I’m sure your mother is still scared every day she’s going to find you on the floor when she visits. Re-earn her trust and find boundaries you both are comfortable with, but know you aren’t going to be able to tell her to let you live the way a normal person your age will. "
"Stop making excuses. You're continuously not gaining the distance you need with this friend to prioritize your gf. Would you be ok with her being so close to a guy she thought would be a ""perfect"" partner? How would you feel in that situation? You're in the wrong here OP. And if you want a future with your gf, you'd do what you need to do to get distance from your friend. You obviously don't want to do that, so you aren't serious about your gf."
"You are AWFUL at research.

I googled molluscum. First site that came up was the wiki. It says all the ways it can be caused, including Sexual Contact.

Unless of course you believe she's cheating anyway?"
"You ARE blaming her. He's an adult. She shouldn't have to worry about texting and calling her boyfriend to make sure he's on the flight. I mean, how much more do they need to communicate about when the flight obviously leaves at such and such time, and he needs to be there before that or he's getting left behind?"
"I commented already but this hits the nail on the head. His age, complete immaturity, and selfishness by always being late makes all of his complaints to OP seem utterly pathetic. Personally, there’s no way I could stay with someone who couldn’t make it onto a several thousand dollar flight because I’d constantly worry about when he’d flake out during other more serious life events. Gahhh. "
"Yeah, why not say that?  And the fiance's tone is *very* different from OP......he came off really dismissive of Jess.  Don't really know what to make of all this, but fiance coming in and doing clean up isn't going to to change the fact that this social group sounds very cliquey."
This is the dumbest thing I've read all day. Which is saying a lot. 
"....wat 

OP, there’s no way this came completely out of the blue. Has he done this before? Have you guys been fighting lately? Is something else going on in his life? Is he having mental health issues? Where do you think this is coming from?

Because this is *not* a sane reaction to “let’s take a vacation.” Something else is up. "
"Abusers loooove to keep their victims on the hook, and in this case they're using the money as both the carrot and the stick. Unless you made some agreement to pay back this money your dad gave you, it's now yours. Take it and buy a place you can afford. Stop asking for their input. If your parents have issue with that, that's their too bad. If they let it torpedo your relationship with them, that's their problem as well. 

You owe them nothing. They owe you a childhood free from abuse, which they can't give you. 

I also just want to say that if you've never sought therapy for your abuse, I hope you will. Growing up in an abusive household puts you at an increased risk of partner abuse, because we're conditioned to either not see the red flags or to dismiss them. "
Her grandma even stopped giving  money cause she couldn’t afford it any longer. 
I really don't sweat that much ever   #blessed
I'm hurting for your husband ;~; 
It is when you've just completed couple's counseling about your SO not wanting to get married. 
"Take the job. Government employees face burn out at a monumental rate, so more than likely you’ll be back on the hunt soon. Just avoid him as much as possible and if you happen to run into him be polite. I worked at an office of 50 people and after a year I still didn’t even know everyone’s name and didn’t recognize half the people, so I’m sure you won’t have to interact much if at all. "
"I love the concept! I'm forever grateful to my friend who introduced it to me, it explains a lot of my internal dialogue. My dad has been sober for 20 years now, and he has a nugget of wisdom about this that is my favorite, where he says, ""I spent most of my early adult life doing what I thought was right, then I slipped up and did something wrong, I didn't understand why people got mad at me. I tried, right? I had good intentions! Then I realized: People can't see inside my head. They can't see my intentions. They can only see my actions. Of course they're mad; my attempts to explain my good intentions to them just sound like I think I had a good reason to hurt them.""

There's a short video of Will Smith talking about fault vs. responsibility that has circulated the netz lately that I also love. It doesn't directly  mention cognitive dissonance, but it sort of addresses it indirectly by talking about having to take responsibility for reality even if you didn't create (or mean to create) the situation. 

/nerd rant"
You are correct friend. It sucks a lot to have them act so irrational. I'm feeling a rebellion grow inside me. 
Hes projecting himself onto you... this is not a good human being in any capacity. Please please please get out! This person sounds unhinged as fuck.
"&gt;What could she possibly bring to the table that balances out this type of behavior?

Part of the rent and other bills...

Seriously, as someone who had a terrible roommate for two months before moving out because of them, it is worth it to ""keep the peace"" as best as possible until a better option comes along."
Oh I’m not judging your sister. I’m judging YOU. This is bullshit and you know it. Cut this guy off or you WILL lose your sister (and you’ll deserve it).
"She's 14 (!!!) years older than you are =\&gt; massive red flag

She doesn't want your family/friends to know about your relationship (?) =\&gt; massive red flag

You don't feel ready to move in, so don't do it.

If you move in with her, will you still see your current housemates (who are also your friends)? Or will you be fairly isolated?

Honestly, this relationship is not healthy and going nowhere. Get out."
[deleted]
"It's her birthday so she gets to choose how she wants to celebrate, and frankly, this is one of those few times in a relationship where you grin and bear it. Attending social events that may not be your cup of tea once in awhile comes with the territory, not just in relationships, but in life in general. "
"Pshhh, says the person never going to win $100k from Tyler Perry. "
"""Passionate"" relationships with lots of fights and crazy make\-up sex are just hollywood romanticism. A relationship with staying power involves a couple who acknowledge their short\-comings and dialogue about disagreements. 

The thing about having a type based on looks is that looks are temporary. Looks in no way guarantee a personality match. I get that for some people it is really important to date someone they find drop dead gorgeous \- but if your criteria for looks is too narrow, you artificially shrink the field of dating candidates, so you're less likely to find someone who you get along with, enjoy, and share interests with. It's way more important for a life partner to have the qualities you described of your SO. 

Passion is pretty subjective, and I'd argue that it lies at the extremes of inauthenticity and vulnerability. Some people play games and passion is one of those games. Sex is best when you can be authentically who you are with your partner, and vulnerable enough to try new things. 

I'm curious what you mean when you say your relationship lacks passion. Can you be more specific?"
"""not checking other people out"" is something he can 100% control.   His attraction to someone is not."
A adult cant really be this clueless....
"It's good you told him.

It is quite possible that he simply doesn't have the *skills and ability* to process this or to comfort you about it.  It's so alien to a male psychology, it's incredibly hard to put ourselves in the shoes of a woman who had an abortion. He needs to be *helped* to learn to help you. Couples counselling would be an excellent way *for him to learn these skills* and to help you two communicate about this.

*edited for clarity*"
"Why does anyone care about what she chose to do when you both weren't dating? You don't have to like it, but she doesn't have to not sleep with anyone else. 

The lying, however, is another thing. That's not okay."
"If you've never seen him use or look like he's on the nod, why do you assume he's a junkie? People, even people with degrees and education, can end up on the streets due to a run of bad luck of all different kinds, not just drugs."
"You're unique not because you're a tom\-boy or because of  your traumatic past. There are millions of other things about you that make you unique and special to your boyfriend. You've also been together for 2 years \- 2 years of shared experiences, memories, special moments, etc... that are something only you and your SO share. You shouldn't be afraid of introducing him to another person and fear that he will leave you for her \- how are you going to prevent him from meeting other similar people in the future? Are you going to get in your head every time he meets someone that you think is 'similar' to you?

Stop defining yourself by such a narrow view, and realize that your SO loves you, not just these superficial ways that you define yourself. Therapy  might also help because if you think your relationship and his affection are that fickle after 2 years together, it means you don't really fully trust him or believe that he truly loves you."
Trust your instincts.
"Holy shit girl, he has assaulted you 4 TIMES IN THE FIRST MONTH of your relationship.

The best way to bring this up is to sit him and down and say ""We need to talk about your behaviour when drunk."" Then outline the instances, and say you have a zero tolerance for any level of aggressive, violent or non consensual physical behaviour. If he is genuinely apologetic and appalled at his actions this has a chance of changing his behaviour and continuing, but I'd place money on him being defensive, possibly aggressive in return, and minimizing his own behaviour like ""he didn't really hurt you, was just playing, didn't intend any harm."" Worst case he turns this around into victim blaming and says you made him do it because he wanted you to listen or you weren't paying attention or you brought it on yourself in some way.

You need to be prepared to shut down this relationship HARD and end it if he is anything but apologetic, and to make it a dealbreaker moving forward."

"IMO this is super suspicious. His reaction is total rug-sweeping and not the reaction of an innocent person. What if things were reversed- if some dude was DMing your husband asking for you and you genuinely had no idea who he was, what would your reaction be? Would you tell your husband ""I dunno, just block him"" or would you do your best to figure out who this person is and why they seem to think you have some sort of involvement? I know *I* wouldn't be able to let it go until I got to the bottom of it. It would piss me off that someone was trying to make trouble for me by making it seem like I was having an affair and I certainly wouldn't just shrug it off and change the subject, I'd be compelled to prove my innocence because I wouldn't want my spouse worrying.

My theory- he was messing around with her, ghosted her, and now she's DMing you as a way of retaliating and getting his attention. If I was a jilted other woman, that's exactly what I would do. She may not be able to get him back, but she can at least get him busted. Also, he has clearly communicated with her since this happened since she blocked you. She messaged you first, there is no logical reason for her to block you unless he contacted her and told her to. 

Time to get into his phone."
"Take her husband with her...to work? Goodness me. No. That's incredibly unprofessional. He *is* being a complete asshole, as evidenced by him giving her the silent treatment. 

He needs to act like an adult and have an adult conversation, and she needs to shine up her spine and say no when her husband is being unreasonable. "
You should not act like an asshole toward women to manipulate them. That's unhealthy as hell.
"I would add that OP doesn't sound like he's in a good place to be with anyone.

Even if they get back together, it shouldn't be now while his happiness feels dependent on her, knowing about her, and being with her.

Don't put that on her OP. Get yourself right so you have something to bring to the relationship if it happens again. "

"It's understandable that you are equating your experience to the example of your parents marriage and their experience in counseling. 


But you aren't your parents! And this relationship is a totally different thing. All the communication struggles you detail are excellent reasons to seek out counseling, they are exactly why you need help and to learn more and improved communication techniques. It sounds like you've tried what you know and identified some gaps where you can learn. 


If you'd only ever met a dog once and he snarled and bit you, it's understandable that your be scared of dogs. But there are far more great dogs in the world than dogs that will bite you. And you'd really be missing out if you let your triggered fear keep you away from dogs your whole life. "
"I am so sorry that you're in this situation, OP. One thing I would keep in mind is that this is going to be hard for them regardless. I know that probably doesn't sound very helpful but you really need to evaluate what you think would be hardest - will it be living without support in their house or will it be leaving home but having support and adult guidance? Personally I'm inclined towards the second. Your kids are still young - it's great that they can do so much and that you've prepared them for that but they're still so young, their brains haven't finished developing. Discuss this with your family so that you are best prepared to make an informed decision."

I second the urge to call the authorities and report this. They need to  get help and get caught up as soon as possible. Especially the developmentally disabled one. good luck and i hope this gets rectified.

"Given that you’ve already cheated on her, I suspect if you try to set boundaries with her friend, she’ll just blow you off. There’s probably a degree of projection happening here. I think it’s ok to be uncomfortable with the friend but I also think she should still be friends with him.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "
That’s pretty much what I was trying to get at. When you start on opiates they are strong. If he was taking them that fast OP would know. It would be really hard to miss. But the mom is probably at a point of high tolerance trying to get more. The anger she’s displaying is also in line with someone seeking more drugs. 
Yes normal reaction would be to ask him to leave not to go get more drugs. It’s not adding up.

"Well, I think that’s kind of what the other posters are telling you. When you live with someone, you generally match your activity level to theirs, a lot of the time, simply by default. That doesn’t mean you can’t go out and be active, but it does mean your boyfriend may resent you for doing those things instead of what he values, or, conversely, you may resent him for the same. Living together puts a whole new dynamic on how you view separate activities. 

You may find you enjoy sitting at home more often with him or vice versa: he may get into sports with you. But you shouldn’t anticipate that things will run ‘separate but equal’ or smoothly all the time just because your finances aren’t combined. Everything else certainly will be. "
"Even if your theories are true, his wife had 5 years to think it about then and decided to marry him anyway. The real question is if she's only having second thoughts now, or if she always planned to push him into an office.

The former can probably be talked out, the latter is a severe lack of a respect."
"1. Don't snoop. Jesus christ, the snooping. 

2. Did he actually say he was ready to be committed to her and their potential child? Honestly, it sounds like a joke a dudebro makes when he comes inside a girl during some really satisfying sex.

3. If it wasn't a joke, then good for him for being ready to step up if she was pregnant. If he knocks you up, hopefully he will have the same great attitude."
"&gt; You don’t really know why she didn’t tell him.

And over five years of pining, is he really so clueless that he didn't know? Maybe I'm a cynic, but I sure have to wonder if he's *knowingly* dating the sister of a girl who pined over him for years. "
You’ve spent a lot of time justifying yourself to us when you should have just said something to your sister. 
"&gt;I don’t drink and I really don’t like people who do.

"It's telling that your first idea is divorce...instead of getting her an actual diagnosis and some couples counseling.

"OP, Run. 

I married a 29 year old man when I was 18 and just out of school. It was the biggest mistake of my life. He wanted to mold my young mind into what HE wanted so he could control me. This guy sounds like a serious narcissist. I finally had the courage to divorce my abuser after 6 long years of marriage. Sadly I share a child with him now which I do love dearly and don’t regret for anything... but I’m now stuck to this guy for at least 12 more years. Don’t get yourself into the same situation. RUN. "
"Well... Shit my dude. It's multiple things that combined are kinda bad.


1. When she told you she had a crush, you should have just said ""I'm not interested."" not ""oh if I was single"". That's basically saying like ""oh i like this but darn it I'm married."" definitely seems to be encouraging. 

2. You shouldn't have texted with her afterwards. You should have limited your interaction to purely professional. 

3. You should have told your wife. If you just told your coworker no and then informed your wife, it probably wouldn't have been a big deal. But not telling her seething like this is basically lying by omission.

All were not good actions on your part, but combined its really ugly.

Apologize to your wife. Like genuine, not ""im sorry you're upset."" minimalize contact with this coworker to purely professional. You can be friendly, but she crossed a line and you shouldn't be close to her. Do not hide stuff from your wife. "
"For the initial incident it sounds like she wasn't trying to be mean to you. more like that the two of you had different reactions (you were very embarrassed and she was laughing off the incident as ""no big deal/nothing bad"" not realising how negatively doing so affected you) 

But then she knew. She knew because you left and she said sorry. She knew. And she then chose to tell many people about the incident in a humiliating setting.   

If you after a week of reflection decided it was hilarious and ultimately no big deal, Common sense and manners and shit still dictates that she should have checked you were ok with her telling the story (and to who it would be ok to tell and when) before doing so. 

So now she has ""assumed it wasn't a big deal to you"" (to use the most favourable wording possible) and has reacted to your telling her it's not ok by telling you you've overreacted. 

Big red flag. Even for the most ""ex is great what a saint she is"" version of things, she's crossed a major line. She's not respecting your feelings or wishes or privacy. 

Dumping was the right choice. Stick to it."

Immediately assuming someone is guilty is a scary path to go down in society. What you wrote suggests not only is OP's friend 100% guilty of being a rapist but also that OP himself would like reasons to be ok with that. Neither of those are conclusions a rational person reading this post should come to.

"There is absolutely no reason for a parent to believe that a child of 23 would put them first.  The next 20 years are your prime years to become your own person and build a family of your own.

"Anal isn't supposed to bleed, the fact he's being a sexually abusive asshole trying to push and push and push you into acts that make you unhappy aside.  Threats of divorce or ""I'll stop doing nice things for you because you won't do this physically painful thing for me"" are absolutely not normal in a relationship.  Having to rationalize your no to a sex act isn't normal, he just literally wants to cause you pain and that's so fucked up and selfish.  Note how he suddenly changed his tune with the divorce threat when his threat wasn't working.

I'd google 'lundy bancroft why does he do that pdf', counselling won't change him, he'd have to go through an abuser program and it doesn't seem like he's going to do that so I'd cut your losses and work on an escape route when you're ready.  You don't deserve to be worn down by abuse by your own partner.  You're not selfish or unreasonable, you're being manipulated by an asshole and that's where the doubts are coming from."
"Third option is using a donor embryo! It's not her egg or your sperm but she can carry the baby. This way she gets to experience pregnancy and child birth and it's neither of your genes. I will say though that if you use a sperm donor it would probably be the fastest way to get pregnant and definitely the cheapest, donor embryo could get costly and adoption would be the longest most expensive route.

Forgiving them was a good thing. Didn’t mean you ‘had to’ mend relationships and carry on as usual. Not forgiving them would have eaten you up from the inside. Glad you’re happy and doing better. 
"Except he needs to care, and he must want to change, and based on what you wrote about him, he just doesn't really care all that much about you.  You are kind of like gum stuck to the bottom of his shoe, you'll be there until he decides that he wants to remove it.  "

Maybe she wants to be a homemaker? There’s nothing wrong with that type of marriage if both parties want it.

"Yeah, that part blows my mind. If my friend had just gone through a breakup, part of being supportive is not flaunting my own relationship. It's EXPONENTIALLY worse that this Garbage Friend was trying to be vague by omitting that the new relationship was with OP's ex, and didn't admit it until asked.

That's flat out sadistic."
"13 years and only *1* family vacation is definitely not the norm for an American family that isn't ""hurting for money in any way."" If they were struggling, bouncing from job to job, had extreme health issues, it would be more the norm.

No. He's controlling in the extreme and you need to escape immediately.
"The sex issues are just a smoke screen for a deeper issue *your wife is being abusive towards you*. Yelling and screaming at you for 10 hours is *not normal*. This is not something you should have to put up with. 

The fact that you’re too afraid of her reaction to this issue with her, means communication in your relationship is severely broken. Your role in this relationship is not to be her personal punching bag. 

I suspect that she’s likely depressed. People who don’t take care of themselves are usually demonstrating on some level that they don’t value themselves. Certainly her habits and social isolation support the depression theory. 

But honestly, her situation should be *secondary* to your physical and mental wellbeing. I’d imagine that at this point she’s really torn down your happiness and self worth.  

If I were you, I’d insist on couples counselling. Go now before one of you break and the real hell begins. "
How do you know that? You can't possibly have enough information to know that. Why does he have to be insecure and can't be actually concerned in this situation?
"He wouldn't be setting up a hidden camera on his wife, he would be setting up the camera on his pills. To see what's happening to them. They aren't vaporizing into thin air, someone is stealing them. If that person is his wife, then he needs to know."
"I don't see anywhere in this post where he walked out on you, but if he does, let him go. and tell him to take the dog with him. He isn't doing anything to help you anyway. "
This makes so much sense because I have GAD and I think similar to OP.
"You have left one abusive relationship for another.  Make no mistake, this dude is an abuser...classic signs.

Please know that this will not stop.  He won't stop doing this...the not listening, the disregarding of your opinions and feelings, and even the hitting.  If you can accept that thought for a minute, you need to plan how to go.  Go to loveisrespect(dot)org **from a device he can't unlock** and look at their resources.  Also see the FAQ here and check out the related subreddits.

Do NOT go to couples counseling with him.  Abusers pervert therapy into tools they can use against their victims.  Therapy will not help an abuser -- while some are mentally ill, most feel that they are entitled to do what they do.  It's a *belief* not an imbalance.  Just like racism or religion, they have to change their own mind about it.

Know this: what he did is NOT your fault.  NOTHING he does is your fault.  He's doing it because he wants to...he gets off somehow when doing it."

"There's a LOT y'all can do before going to ""get rid of him or break up"". (I'm a vet tech FYI).  If you really want to save this relationship, the next step is to focus on how to make this dog more manageable. Drugs to address anxiety are fine, but training is also essential. He's trying to assert his dominance in the pecking order, which is why he'll keep going for your dog, her food, etc. Her dog should be wearing a muzzle \- on walks, around guests, etc.   It keeps y'all safe from bites and being sued, it keeps him safe from being euthanized. Both of you should make an appointment with an animal behaviorist or a trainer/facility that works specifically with aggressive dogs. Even a naturopathic vet can offer alternatives to the traditional drugs she's probably using (acupuncture and Chinese herbs can work wonders).   


  
You BOTH have to work with the dog on this \- this isn't just her problem now, it's yours. If you're not willing to work with her dog, be prepared to break up. Put yourself in her shoes. Yes, the dog is a pain in the ass and a huge liability, but he's also a life in her care. To ask her to toss that aside is a huge ask and, frankly, unfair. You may soften the blow by finding no\-kill rescues who work with rehoming aggressive dogs, but don't count on her jumping on board for that. If anything, that should be a last resort. He's a special needs dog \- y'all need to work together to meet those needs. If you and her are in it for the long haul, then you'll find a way to work through this TOGETHER. I'm happy to PM with you for follow up re: veterinary resources. "

"I wrote a much longer explanation but deleted it because it was getting too long.  This is one of the things I mentioned though.  I usually would build up a pretty big stash and then every once in awhile I would have to cancel an appointment and not bother rescheduling it and just use up the extras I had accumulated.

"This is 100% about you and not about her. Stop making it about you. She can fantasize about whatever she wants to, and you should get your insecurities under control before they get in the way of your relationship ship.

"Say because of health issues in pregnancy there may be interventions during the birth so the hospital recommends only your partner is in hospital during delivery, only your mother and mother in law can visit immediately afterwards, so no one else will be admitted, you'll text your friends to let them know when the baby is born. Tell the hospital no visitors until you are ready. 

You won't have time for a needy insecure friend when you have a baby to look after round the clock. You need to choose your team, people who will offer to cook, clean, buy nappies, and be cheerful are better company than people who are wrapped up in needing validation from you. Shed the dead weight if you need to."
"From the OP: 

&gt; it’d be about 8-10 children ranging from infancy to 12. 

For one thing, that is an overly large number of kids. Guidelines for many day cares specify one adult for 3 - 4 kids. No one could reasonably be expected to keep the babies are and changed, prevent the toddlers from killing each other and themselves, and make sure the older kids don't get into mischief. If the older kids were all good and helped with the little ones *maybe* this would be doable, but realistically there would be one or two older kids who would take advantage of this overwhelming situation by bullying the others or sneaking off and disappearing. Then you would have at least one set of parents who would fully take advantage of the situation, disappear until 10 the next morning, and offer the babysitter a crumpled $5 as a tip. "
"Oof. OP, I grew up with parents like this (but in the opposite fashion - I was really into nerdy things, Harry Potter, comic books, etc, and they were into NASCAR and drinking beer with their friends). My parents would make snide remarks about my interests, and would actively be disengaged when I tried to share those interests with them. They did let me get whatever books I wanted, for which I am grateful, but that was as far as the interest in my life and my hobbies extended.

As a result now, as an adult, we don't really see one another or talk. They're content to do their own thing, watch their car races and go on camping trips with their friends where they can drink Bud Light all day and night, and I'll sometimes go months without seeing them. As an adult, it still causes me some anger and embarrassment that they never even tried *pretending* like they cared about my interests, even just to spend time with me. I'm 30 years old, and still just feel sad about it.

Don't let his relationship with your kids become like that."
"Something doesn't add up here. How do you possibly let ""slip"" something that is a deep dark secret in your relationship? Why did you even bring it up? Were you just trying to rub something in your wife's face? I am not a fan of one sided open relationships. There is too much room to take advantage of the other person. Your wife didn't want to date other but you did. Was she really ok with this or did she just say the words ""ok"" in an attempt to get you to stay with her? This whole thing seems off and you seem like you don't want to take responsibility for having drunkenly aired your filthy laundry. 

And now to top it off you want her to cut off her best friend. Dude you sound dirty. "
"What do you mean by dealing with Maria directly? She thinks you're a cheater, you telling her to back off and stfu would make things a million times worse, so please don't.

"Not just her time, but her kids' time. This guy is not being a good fatherly figure for her kids at all.

"I agree. Especially when people say things like CICO doesn't work or that certain health conditions mean you absolutely cannot lose weight. Some conditions make it harder, but it's not impossible. It's hard, but it requires work. It's one of those go-to responses that say ""but it doesn't work for me, what is wrong with me...it can't be me...""

"She is overreacting and is unduly affected by the influence of this friend.  For her to decide you can't cohabitate because of her religion is extreme.  I grew up in a Christian household and this would not be an issue for me or anyone I know.

I would ask her to discuss this with her priest/pastor/vicar depending on her denomination, and get some more guidance.  

One question: is she a recent convert to Christianity?  Quite often they are the most zealous about stuff and overthinking it, as they so insecure about their faith.  People with long standing faith are less so and more considered.  Either way, your fiance is easily swayed and definitely insecure for some reason.

The 'friend' is also a busybody, who wants to impose their interpretation of the bible onto everyone around them, without any consideration.  Every Church has them, and even people in that congregation will roll their eyes about those people!"

"&gt;A girl, Kiki, came to a third person in our social circle, let's call this third person Kate.

If you want to be really neutral and stay out of it you should tell your mom your not willing to get between their disagreement. If you want to side with your sister you should try to convince your parents to actually MEET Pete before stereotyping him based on his family and where he lives. If anything they should have more sympathy for his past behaviour and judge him on his current actions not his past."
"Astrology doesn't require you to sell out your friends, isolate yourself, give 10000s of dollars to a high control group, and isolate yourself from non-believing friends. 

I see where you're going with the comparison, but I don't think astrology is bad *by default* the way Scientology is. "
"I always wonder who hurt people who are so adamant about ""correcting"" everybody. Ya'll are insufferable."
"have you tried giving the bj before penetration?  it might reduce the amount of time you spend having penetrative sex, but getting him close to an orgasm *before* having penetrative sex could solve the problem."
OP if you do this please pick someone who knows how to work your camera or phone. You can also ask to see it then ask them to take another and do it. I know it sounds silly but a lot of people are not comfortable with technology.
"Surely the anniversary would be when they get married, not when he proposes?"
Bad move on ending a relationship over a hobby.
"How have you approached her on this? Before you embarrassed her in front of your friends so I don't blame her for being defensive. I think having it so that way she can talk freely in front of friends is alright. Seems like it bothered you more than it bothered her friends. Maybe just start off by saying those two points you mentioned here to her and say ""look, I may not fully understand your new interest but I do understand that our kids are still growing and making decisions for themselves, I would appreciate it if maybe we can limit the topics of astrology to a minimum around them."" I think that because you've shut her down in front of friends and you don't seem to be that interested it really leaves her with no one to share her new interest with, are there any other people around that share her interests where can get that connection with? Might reduce her need to consistently bring it up to you and the kids if anything. "
"Yes you do. Figure out your relationship or end it, but don't fuck up a perfectly good friendship because your ego took a hit "
It was one example of many in my situation. I just chose the easiest one to explain. He also kept saying he didn't want the alarm and constantly tried making his problem my duty to solve. I figured my comment was long and didn't want to explain this part lol
"""Honesty, without compassion, is just cruelty"""
"- Never spent time together without your daughter present 

- “Spoils” you and your daughter with vacations, etc.

- Never had sex with him

- He has a creepy “pet name” for you saved as well as various pictures/porn/apps on his phone yet won’t have sex with you because it’s “awkward” with children around.

You’re in this relationship wearing rose colored glasses, you do NOT know this man at all. From an outsiders point of view his intentions are clear (as well as his manipulation over you), and they’re in no way acceptable nor okay."
This is why you contact the property management group first and get ahead of this. B has threatened to violate the lease (not paying rent) so she can violate the lease (bringing the dog). She has no leverage. 
"Thanks. Think other comment must've been deleted.  I dont wanna look like im overcompensating either though. It's just hard as with the heels thing, I'm chest level to them all and they're trying to stop me so it was like 4 6ft+ in heels girls vs 4'10 me"
Yeah this is what I’m concluding here as well!
Not every bad behaviour is gaslighting. 
"When you spend massive proximity with someone, I.e the levels you guys are, it’s hard to seperate our feelings into the compartments we know we’re meant to. Both of you likely feel closer than you are and this means more to both because of it. This leads to investment emotionally that is a bit over the line for people in relationships. For you it’s likely because you’re trying to get closer work style, and he’s gone down a different path. 

It’s not anybodies fault, though it’s tempting to blame the older person assuming they should know better. You’re both investing emotionally in this more than is appropriate, even if it’s just you letting him do it. You’re seeking a different relationship to the one he is seeking with you. He is driving this and you have to choose where the line is. 

"
"This doesn't sound like an issue of just titles\- it sounds like he is not ready to be committed. The reason people are hesitant to use labels or titles is because they imagine that if they don't use them, they don't have to deal with the responsibilities they entail\- which isn't really the case because you are essentially dating now, but I guarantee this is what he is thinking. In the past he pulled away when he had to do girlfriend/boyfriend relationship stuff like showing up to your events, meeting your family, letting you know where he is, having boundaries with other women etc. He's going to continue pulling away when you ask him to do things for you or have any type of responsibility towards you, and then say ""you aren't my girlfriend anyway"" to get out of it. "
If his way of being in a relationship worked he would still be with an ex.  He's gaslighting you. 
"If you really want to wait for marriage with her, don't forget that her sudden lack of libido may not have anything to do with religion at all and you might be for a sexless marriage in the long run. It seems like the two of you are slowly becoming incompatible in more than one way."
"Thank you for your advice, I think counseling would be best, I’m just not sure how to approach him about it. I’ll figure something out, though. "
Such an insightful answer. And you answered my question perfectly! A million thank you's. 
People who encourage their LDR partners to drop everything and move to be with them only to be doing this kind of shit afterwards deserve a special place in hell
Presumably OP is a mature adult who can be trusted to get drunk without cheating on her SO. Like most decent people can.
"Your husband is a narcissist who thinks spending time with his children is a waste. If one my friends told me that, Id punch them in the face (not really, but metaphorically).

This is absolutely unacceptable and I say this as someone whose interests are very similar to your husband.

I have a wife and daughter (shes still just a baby) and while I love it if my wife indulges in hobbies with me, I make sure to equally give that kind of time back to her and her hobbies.

I hope my daughter takes some of my nerdy side, but if she doesnt Id never burden her with it. Honestly, her being her own independent person with their own ideas and thoughts and interests would make me a happy father.

You guys need counselling but as a nerd myself, your husband is so so soooo in the wrong here. Like if he doesnt get his shit together and make your children feel like their unique interests are important or on equal standing to his own, this will devolve into a very unhappy home."
Storing up sore spots and sensitive information about the people close to you so you can use it to hurt them later isn’t a “quirk”. It’s a gaping flesh wound in his character. One that you seem to think a few band-aids will fix. 
Do you want your kids walking on eggshells too and having to smooth things over and play peace keepers and always have to keep tabs on Daddy's moods?
I think everyone’s a bit grossed out because it really sounds like the couple went for looking splashy over their friends and loved ones. Especially since it’s a destination wedding so people have to shell out quite a bit of money themselves just to attend and buy the couple a gift.
People do shitty things and people make mistakes. That doesn't mean that you can't change for the better. Get therapy dude.
"Welp. You just spent $1000 to find out that your friend has no class and even less empathy. People have certainly paid more for the same lesson. 

I’d be interested to see if any of her other friends bother attending her future events after seeing what she did to you. Methinks her baby showers will be a bit sparse. "
"Then he needs to find some way of dealing with his anxieties that doesn't involve you giving up these awesome perks of your job. That's his work to do, not yours."
"You can always just come right back and say “hey. Are you texting her outside of work? Ok.. that is feeding your relationship and I would like to set that as a boundary.” 

I’m sure that he knows texting someone you’ve admitted to having feelings for is not acceptable. 

The three ways an emotional (usually work) affair start: 
- going to lunch/coffee 1 on 1
- texting outside of work
- discussing relationship issues

The thing is, he should be going over the top to reassure you that he is taking steps to stomp out this spark between them. He sure as hell should not be texting this woman. You feel bad because you didn’t even know she existed. He not only kept a crush from you, but a whole person. That is very dangerous in my opinion. It means he saw her as a threat to your marriage. 

You need to sit down with him and talk about this more. Most importantly, ask him how he would feel if the situation was reversed. Ask him if he thinks it would be ok for you to text an attractive younger guy that you admitted to crushing on. Ask him what steps he would want you to take. "
"No, they do not. 

You have got to start seeing yourself as a person of worth, who has value outside of what you can give to other people. "
Its gross and disrespectful and you are completely justified. 
This is insane.  Stop subjecting your son to such insanity and get out. 
This is actually brilliant 
"So then why bother with the manipulation of playing your song without putting a name to it to trick her? If you need someone to validate your art, she made it clear it was not her. You admit that you didn't think her opinions were honest. You could have either had a conversation with her expressing this or moved on. Instead, you chose to instigate an issue that she clearly had no interest in discussing further. "
Any co-workers wearing make-up?
"&gt; Our date is this Friday and we’re gonna have a picnic at this secluded spot.    
&gt;  
&gt; I don’t want to go empty handed for our first date 

Then bring some sandwiches or a bottle of wine.

I think a portrait of her that took 'hours' is probably not a gift from a first date. It shows that you've already put a lot of investment into her and that puts pressure on things. You've only been texting a few weeks and barely know her, you need to hit the brakes.

Equally, I imagine it could come across as a little creepy depending on how old this Instagram photo is. Like if it's years old then it shows you went quite a way back through her photos for it and that's a bit odd. Would also be a bit creepy if you chose a photo of her when she's 16 or something. Also, on a practical front, what is she going to do with a portrait of herself? Hang it in her flat and seem like the most self\-obsessed person in the world?"
"Dude, stop it. Just go on the date and get to know this girl. My guess is she won't remember that conversation. It's a first date, which is not something to make a big deal about."
"I wasn't trying to push his buttons (was NOT my intentions at least). He brought this discussion to me, then refused to talk about it? It triggered a massive downward spiral of anxiety in me.. so from my perspective it's like he mashed all of *my* buttons, then sat down in front of his video game and acted like everything was fun and games. With no 'lets talk about this in an hour' or 'give me 10 minutes to cool down'. Just 'go away', with a smirk. I don't know... I see where you're coming from here, but from my perspective I feel like he opened this conversation, then walked away from it despite me being open to talking about it (and I was not yelling, raising my voice, calling him names or being confrontational). This was something he brought up to me in the morning, and it was then late at night. He expected us to just not discuss it at all? Normally we discuss things. I have *never* blocked the TV/turned off his game. This was just mind boggling to me that he was acting like a child. "
"I am a cis woman with androgenic alopecia (MPB)!

You're right that it generally doesn't get as bad as it does in men, but aside from weird conditions like telogen effluvium, and the kind of thinning of the folicle that happens in aging, most baldness that happens in women is male pattern!  They just tend to call it ""female pattern baldness"" even though it's still caused by the same thing, DHT in the scalp.  It's why ""Rogaine for Women"" is literally the same shit as ""Rogaine for Men"", just watered down."
"Wow you have some serious talent for putting words in other people's mouths. 

No, I'm not at all saying she isolate herself from her coworkers. I have plenty of professional, cordial relationships with coworkers and we don't do happy hour every Friday. There isn't **one and only one** way to have cordial, professional relationships. And if OP does want to continue going to happy hour, she could just not stay late and get sloshed with her BFs ex. Not really that complicated or confusing."
Thank you! Sex twice a week is perfectly normal. Especially with a baby!
Maybe it isn’t a “sure thing” and she worries taking about it too much might jinx it. I know I don’t “feel” like the job is real until I literally start so I don’t tell anyone anything for sure until then. 
"I don't think you give enough of the situation with your girlfriend for us to comment on her feeling""turned off."" Like was she repremanding you for defending yourself? If so dump her. 

Did the whole situation frighten her and she was not feeling up for sex? That would seem totally normal to me, assuming she also expressed care for your well-being. 

 Did she see the abuse you suffered, see your defense of yourself as uncontrolled and emotional, and fear that the violence you grew up with may make you more likely to react violently to future situations? That would be more nuanced. Obviously it's good to defend yourself. However, if she is concerned that you might perpetuate the cycle of violence (like your mom immitating the abuse she was raised with) then it is up to you to decide if you want to prove to her that you are going to break that cycle or if you want to dump her for not trusting that you aren't ever going to be violent towards her or any future children you have. "
"Since you're already in therapy, make sure you bring up your low self esteem, jealousy, and interpersonal avoidance at your next appointment. The earlier you address issues the quicker you can fix them. "
"Is blasting your radio near their home something that is only built into the people of your race?  If not don't blame this on racism.  From what you are telling me, this sounds way more that they want their daughter to learn to appreciate a nice quiet settled Christian boy, and you don't come off as ANYTHING like the boys they set her up with.  Dude...this could come off in your favor...as long as you can keep your opinions about their lifestyle to yourself."
"""You're not secure in your relationship unless you're fine with your SO posting nudes online"" is possibly the dumbest line of thinking I've heard on this sub lmao"
I take back my answer. This is my answer. 
"Got it, thanks for clarification. If he's already agreed to support you through the process of getting licensed in your new state, then this seems reasonable to me. I'm not sure that there is a more practical way for him to support you, anyway. Handing over money in increments would be kind of weird. Make sure to sit down and get on the same page about how much you will be spending during this time so that neither of you are blindsided by bank statements."
Call. The. Police. Your parents will wait until he gets arrested as an adult.  He needs consequences now.
"They aren't necessarily racists. OP is white and so is his gf. His logic for them ""being racist"" are they don't like him blasting rap music in their neighborhood. "
"At this point you'd just be picking a fight for the sake of picking a fight. Just be honest about how bad the date was. They'll either A. Take that into consideration in the future and have better options. B. Realize they have no skill matchmaking and give it a rest. Or C. Ignore you and fuck up again. In which case, you never ever let them set you up ever again. 

I understand being angry if you felt they deliberately set you up to have a bad time, but think about it. You have identified your type... and yet you are single. Therefore, it's not *totally* out of left field for people to deviate from your formula and see what the results are. Not saying they were right, this guy sounds horrid. But don't take misguided attempts to match\-make too personally. Nobody is really great at it.

Hope you have better luck down the road! Also, congratulations\- being an engineer is hard and cool."
Maybe if someone says no to something you stop pushing it? Maybe also try reading the post?
"I honestly don't think you could be any more wrong.

I've been his fucking rock over the past few years. I pay for all our outings together because I make more money (and still don't resent that, because I was my decision). I've cooked him meals and baked goods on my own (never reciprocated). I've planned fun dates for us. I've consoled him when he got his rejections, helped him write his personal essays, and researched programs for him. I get him small gifts just because and I've spent hours talking about medical shit and politics with him, even though I don't personally care about either of those things.

I've given everything I have to give and gotten jack shit in return but neglect and the occasional ""but I love you."""
"&gt; to confront my mom about a shitty text she sent my wife. ...Mom is upset because my wife has been giving her the cold shoulder and she feels like she’s innocent of any wrong doing and my wife believes that because of said claimed innocence, there is no point in discussing the situation. 

Pretty much on your wife's side here. It's clear your mother is being shitty and your wife has resorted to being a numb robot to deal with it. Can you pick the kids up instead?"
Bras are suuuuuuper uncomfortable but I agree with the rest of your statement.
Now you're bending over backwards claiming that hard drugs might be legal where OP lives? Don't you think you're going down a silly road here?
"OP knows his friend better than you do. **OP knew that his friend wouldn't want to go on a first-date with a girl like her.**  

OP's girlfriend explicitly told OP that she didn't want the guy to _ever_ find out about the cousin's past. I read that part. Did you?"
"The language thing is no big deal. The fraudulently overcharging credit cards *is* a big deal, and absolutely should not be ""let be."""
"&gt;Over the next 2 months, he stopped paying rent on our apartment and I was evicted. He tried to get primary custody of our son. He tried to take him out of state to stay with his new girlfriend. He reported me to the board of nursing and told me that he was going to do everything he could to get my license revoked. He turned his whole family and friends against me.

Not only did he cheat on you, but he tried to ruin your life. He tried to sabotage your career out of spite. He is not a good person nor a good partner. You should go and lawyer up again and make it clear how vindictive this guy can be. "
"That is really manipulative behaviour. You didn’t do anything wrong. You’re entitled to control 100% of the things that happen to your body, and he’s punishing/guilting you for it? Get outta there! "
Classic NiceGuy life narrative.  
"your mom knows EXACTLY what she is doing. She is going to play this like a fiddle and the second you think it’s done, treat your wife like garbage.

I realize childcare is costly. But allowing your mom to treat your wife like garbage is unacceptable. So it’s probably time to pony up and pay for childcare."
"I also refer to lots of older people as Mr. and Mrs. Name as a 23 year old.  But those people aren't my prospective parents-in-law trying to infantilize me, which is an important change in context. Fiance is an adult and she should be treated as an adult by OP's parents, not as a kid still in high school coming over to meet the parents before prom.     

It never ends with the tiny battle over names.  Later it'll be battles over what their wedding is like, and where they live, and what their kids will be named, and it never ends.  OP should establish theiir boundaries as an adult now, rather than letting them walk all over them and their future wife.  "

"No I think O.P his friend saved a lot of time that could have been wasted on the wrong person. There's really no indication the cousin has changed, as a friend I'd want to know then make my own decision. 

No apology is necessary. Sounds like cousin doesn't realize how her actions can actions can be received by others. Which goes back to being a personal problem."
"I’m (23F) on the spectrum (high functioning Aspergers) and have been dating my (26M) neurotypical boyfriend for 2yrs. We just bought out first house together, actually. 

It certainly can work if she’s high-functioning enough, and knows how to handle herself. ADHD sort of comes with the diagnosis, so that’s probably where the “scatter brain” is coming from. 

Schizoaffective is a mixed bag, but totally easy to have under control. 

Maybe go out on a few more dates before settling into a title’d relationship, but it really can’t hurt to try if you’re into her. "
"There are plenty of situations where opinions aren't valued or welcomed. The workplace is usually one of them. 

It seems like being ""silenced"" (e.g. Not having your opinion welcomed) makes you feel very defensive. Honestly, I would just let this one go.

In a group of 3, 2 very close friends usually will back eachother up and won't enjoy debating just for the sake of a debate. "
"Your mom told you the right thing and you did the right thing. Your friends are shit people and whatever culture they think you're going against by doing this, that isn't a culture you should want any part of. 

I'm a criminal. I don't engage in criminal activity anymore, but I've been to prison and have several (what you'd call ""felonies"") on my record. But even *I* don't think you did anything wrong. 

Snitching is when you turn on your mates and talk about the crimes you committed together. It's when you get busted with a kilo of coke and give up the rest of your crew to get a shorter sentence. It's when you say ""It wasn't me who pulled a gun, it was Joe."" It's *NOT* snitching when a young woman like you helps the cops grab two scumbags who you don't even fucking know, who did a hit and run on an old woman.

And really, what the hell else could you have done? You're one girl. Ain't like you could go and sort it out yourself. Even if I was standing right there with five mates, what are we going to do? Run into that building, grab the guys and kick their ribs in? I mean sure we can do that, but who does that help?

Even a criminal can appreciate that there are some situations where the police are the right tool for the job. This was one of them. You should feel proud of yourself."
"To be fair to her friends they weren’t being racist, they never said don’t talk to the police in regards to black people or Hispanics, they just don’t want her to talk to the police ever about anything. She never referenced her friends mentioning any race at all, and to turn the tables, saying they only care about the cops in regards to their own culture is a bit of a racist thing to say.

Don’t get me wrong, it still makes them disgusting people who would leave a poor old lady with an injured husband and a wrecked car without helping her, just not racist."
Yet another sign of your high maturity.  
"If tradition is more important than the OPs wishes and mental health and wellbeing, then she should seriously consider whether she wants to try to build a life with him. What other traditions of his will be more important than her expressed wishes? "
Nope. He was an a position of authority and it's very possible he was grooming her while she was underage.
I'm wondering if you read the post. 
Agreed! Just be thankful for the food and family!
"&gt;he has the right to veto certain clothing

I mean, he doesn't, though."
"Your girlfriend shouldn't be cleaning your house. Move out, because your mom is going to just to keep shitting on your girlfriends. 

I think you should walk away when she starts shit talking your gf. If she asks why, ""I'm really tired of you being so hard on X. She's done nothing but help out when she's here when she doesn't have to, and you still have a problem with her. I'm dating her because I care about her, and that should be enough for you"". Don't tolerate that shit dude. You're an adult."
"&gt; never seems to get through

On the contrary, it seems like you got through to him about how much this bothers you but he chose to weaponize that knowledge."
Yeah this feels like a classic case of getting in front of the story.
"What if she became a nun? Bottom line is that OP was looking out for his friend and told him the truth. His friend had every opportunity to say, ""Well I really like her so I'm going to see this through despite what you've told me."" but instead chose to say, no thanks. That shows that these values are extremely important to this guy and he probably would have been pissed at OP for not saying anything down the road when things fell apart and the truth comes out. "
Especially as modern stretch denims hadn't really become common yet and we were still wearing jeans so tight you had to lie down to zip them up.
"Is it social engineering if after 2 hours, I tell you that you only worked 1 and need to make up for it."
"I think you're severely misguided but you're allowed to be judgmental and as selective as you would like in the dating world. In the end, it's really only you that could be missing out on a wonderful woman. As for her, she escaped a judgmental and insecure guy (you)."
"Sounds like postpartum maybe? In addition to her history, I mean. I'd definitely say try to get her checked into an inpatient facility at least for observation and a diagnosis. You and/or family from either side may need to take full custody, at least temporarily"

This really hurts my heart. I’m a victim of sexual abuse and I’m honestly feeling mortified that I ever let this man touch me. 
"I'm going to be upfront with you. If you want to restrict her from photos, you better be prepared to warn everyone at future parties, weddings, family get-together, school plays etc that they can't post or share picture. 

Honestly, half these people, ""just ban her from your FB""... They don't get it. Digital exchange of photos can go thru any platform. I'm talking about Instagram, Twitter, Google Share, Gmail and even text. She will ask her mother. She will ask your husband. She will ask your side of the family. She will even ask your daughter why she doesn't see photos her growing up anymore, essentially making your daughter WANT to send her photos because she will play the role of 'good auntie'

It's going to be extremely akward for you to warn people to either not take photos or to not upload them to social media. You have to be upfront with her and your husband. "
"I think this one is better than the ""ask my mom"" one, because your poor mom has been going through an even worse hell than you, and she doesn't need to have to sequentially tell 100 people about how she got fucked over by your adulterous dad."
"He stopped when you asked him. Sounds like he respects your boundaries

Edit:spelling"
"Why was she snooping on your old phone and can she explain her hypocrisy? Why does it matter to what you did before her? Why would she tell any of this to her mom and why/how did she go to couples therapy alone? Why does she believe (trying to) cheating on you is the acceptable response to the situation?

I think, given everything, that she was looking for a reason to dump you and made a mountain out of a mole hill to justify her attempt to leave/cheat on you."
"If you choose a different name just because the one you wanted initially is the one that your grandmother wanted as well then she is basically controlling again what you are doing, simply because you'd change the preferred name of your baby that she'll have her entire life. 

Grandma will be dead soon enough. Your baby girl still has a full life ahead, hopefully with the name that you'd want her to have. "
"Man, you remind me of a guy who I dated. It culminated in him getting offended because I didn't want to hear him speak about  how he wants to ""upgrade in the future"" (get a better GF.) anything he didn't like was considered 'unreasonable.'

He would write extremely long things, make everything about him, and when I didn't have the time or energy to respond to every single point, would get more upset, and purposely twist things

For example:

&gt;you're fighting me over 30 seconds of sleep. i don't know what to say to you.

She isn't fighting you over 30 seconds of sleep. She's fighting you over an unreasonable request. and even if she is fighting you over thirty seconds of sleep? Guess what, you don't really have the right to get her to change that thirty seconds either.

She literally told you that she wants to see a message from you first thing when she wakes up, and yet, because she's not doing one small thing they way you want, you lose it!


**I'm not judging you **  i think you might have something else going on. This is common for people who have attachment issues, or anxiety. Can you speak to a therapist?"
"To be fair, \*we\* are having fun with this scenario, but don't actually do that, OP.

Not even jokingly.

This dude has shown he is not capable of normal social interactions, so your joke to show him how bad it sounds, when taken out of context, might reflect badly on you."
"&gt;Seems oblivious to how this is a big deal and probably thinks we're just being killjoys.

She's oblivious because *you* haven't make it clear that it is a very big deal to you.   You haven't even told her that 3 years on, you are *still* very upset about her having announced your delivery on FB and you refuse to confront her whenever she this stuff.   At this point, it's on you be unambiguous in your objections and have the material removed each and every time she does it.

&gt;probably thinks we're just being killjoys.

After all this time you don't actually know what she thinks because *you* have not had an actual conversation about the many times she has overstepped and violated your privacy.   You keep expecting her to respond to hints and when she doesn't, you get upset and come back with yet another ineffective hint.  

If you cannot have an actual discussion with your SIL about this, sit down and write an actual letter.   Be clear that this has been a continuing source of frustration for you since you were blindsided by her inappropriate announcement and that she has repeatedly violated your expressed wishes to refrain from posting photos of your child publicly (give examples).    Then copy your MIL and other family members so everyone understands that you are not okay with this.   

YOU are the only one who can stop her and you have not been assertive enough.
"
"You told her that you had deep feeling for her and she said she did as well. Then she did cheat on you by sleeping with an other guy. Being in a relationship is not define by asking ""do you want to be my GF or BF ?"" but by expressing your feeling to each other.   


In my opinion, this count as cheating. Now you are not stupid to take her back and it s all up to you. Are you willing to forgive her and let her stay ? Are you able to live with the fact that you expressed your feelings and someone reciprocated, but still cheated on you ? Do you still trust her ? etc.. Good luck op  
"
"My mom did this for 18 years and drove herself to misery to the point of cheating. Then felt so guilty she stay with him while demanding a modicum more appreciation from him. Her life is not happy. 


It’s okay to dote in your husband. But don’t do it if he’s going to take you for granted. "
"Doesn't sound unreasonable to me. Don't get me wrong, he can be disappointed to not see you, but he should at least acknowledge that your discomfort is coming from a pretty understandable place! If he's that desperate to see you he could walk over to you and either stay with you, or walk with you back to his dorm. "
I'm so glad you popped up and could possibly help him.
"I'd phrase it out of concern! ""Hey, I've noticed that you're mentally going someplace else when I talk to you. As we're a team, I want to make sure everything's ok and that this isn't impacting your life outside of just talking to me."""
"IMO, it sounds like you might be neglecting your wife in order to talk to your family all the time. How often do you make talking to family a priority over your wife or current household duties?

It's fair to be afraid of the possibility of being surrounded by your in-laws for the rest of your life. While you're halfway around the world now, where do you envision living when you move back to your home country? In the same town as your parents? In the same neighborhood? Maybe you and your wife should discuss your futures and the level of involvement you expect your parents and siblings to have in your lives going forward.

I consider myself to be close to my family, but we don't talk every day, and my husband gets annoyed if my mother calls me and I spend a lot of time chatting with her when we are supposed to be doing something together."
Holy shit he's manipulative. 
And the weird entitlement men feel about making their sad pantsfeelings everyone else's problem.
"Maybe I'm misconstruing what ""proportional"" is but I always thought that meant if he's making 3k and she's making 1k and they have 1k expenses, then she pays the amount proportional to her income. As in she pays $250, he pays $750. Both are paying equally 25% of their individual incomes to bills.

This seems like the fairest solution as it scales perfectly with incomes regardless of how large the gap is. So let's say she gets a new job that pays 100k and he's in a job that pays 40k and expenses are 50k. So he pays $14,285 and she pays $35,715. Both are paying equally ~35.7% of their individual incomes in this scenario.

With proportionality, the equality comes in the form of an equal percentage taken out of each of their paychecks, not equal dollar amounts. Yes he'll still have much more in the bank after expenses, dollar wise, but will be a fair arrangement. Waaaay more fair than what they're currently doing."
The primary reason that people don’t tell others about a pregnancy early on is because they don’t want to talk to them about a potential miscarriage. That is the point of waiting until your chances of miscarriage are lower.

"I think it’s easy to agree to the concept of something but then have a difficult time actually doing it.  I think your husband and yourself need to have a long conversation potentially with a therapist or a neutral third party about the situation.  I understand that your husband agreed to it before you got married but at the same time, things have drastically changed since then.  I really think you need to apologize for the things you said that you regret, then recommend speaking to a therapist together."
"I won't beat around the bush here. Youe husband sounds like he's been spoiled. I have a very successful friend, who is a business owner, that goes through this with his wife. 

Heres the same advice (minus gender) I gave him:

Tell your husband to quit being lazy. If he doesn't like it, show him the door. If you're the only person doing anything, then why even bother keeping him around? There's someone out there who would and will appreciate you more than he does. There's someone out there that would always think about how much you work and sacrifice for the family and would keep the house clean and cook and watch the kids. 

He DOES NOT appreciate you. It's time to put your foot down."
"A massive part of depression is being unable to feel excited about anything\- she is probably upset that you criticized something she has no control over (like telling someone who has a broken leg you never run anymore!).  So yes, I would apologize\- however if she's had untreated depression for 8 years, that's not someone I'd want to be in a relationship with "
"you can't fix that for her. it's her disease talking. if you fundamentally misunderstand this about her,  then i'm sure it felt awful for her having you insist that there was a good thing in her life when she was trying to share something intimate about how hard it is for her to be optimistic. (personally, i couldn't care less about my internet speed, how you both managed to make it such a big deal i have no idea!) 

you cannot RATIONALIZE with a depressed person. it will never work. and i think it even makes things worse because they dig into their side of the argument when they don't feel heard and understood. 

go do some reading about how to support a depressed partner, and then if you want to reopen this relationship, apologize for not listening to what she was sharing and not understanding how her brain was struggling. "
"&gt; Like who the hell does that?

"Well the videos of her were clearly taken while she was unconscious and unaware, so that dude is trash."
"&gt;And honestly, I agree with my step-dad. Our family is already fractured, I don't see the point in making things worse.

i dont know how chinese families work, but they seem similar to my one middle eastern family i grew up with. 

it's the same with us. yemeni parents insist their children only marry yemenis. lebanese only marry lebanese.  etc. even if they're both muslim, they'll always demonize international marriages. 

why i bring this up is i've heard stories of parents disowning their kids for lots of reasons like this. marrying someone white or not muslim, being gay, even things like deciding not to go to med school. 

but 100% of the time, the parents give up and take their children back in my experience. no matter what. its your mom fracturing the family, not you or your older sibling. and the older she gets, the less energy she'll have to endure her children not being in contact with her. 

i can't judge your life, but i'd say go for your independence. your parents will probably not disown you forever. they'll want to see their kids and their (eventual) grandkids. "

This simply isn't true.

"***Neurobiology of Chemical Communication*** **\- Chapter 19: Human Pheromones, Do They Exist?**

&gt;Most definitions imply that a pheromone (a) is comprised of one or only a few chemicals, (b) is species\-specific, (c) has well\-defined behavioral or endocrine effects, and (d) is little influenced by learning. To date, no chemicals have been isolated in humans that meet such criteria.

***Are Human Pheromones Real?*** **\- The Scientific American**

&gt;As the hunt for human pheromones continues, scientists have also investigated other potential explanations for the subtle effects of smells. Consider, for example, the finding that human infants will crawl toward the odor of their mother’s breast. Baby rabbits are known to begin nursing when exposed to a specific pheromone from a lactating mother rabbit. Yet the human infants might simply be attracted to a mother’s so\-called odor print, or unique personal scent. Odor prints are influenced by diet, environment, health and genetics. They consist of far too many compounds to be described as pheromones themselves.

***The Smell of Love*** **\- Psychology Today**

This one goes into a lotta detail about MHC, a segment of DNA that is detectable by scent and is indicative of our immune system. People are attracted to the MHC smells of those who have different immune systems (this helped prevent inbreeding). So, I will edit my post if it'll make ya feel better, but I've found that while there has been zero conclusive evidence of human pheromones influencing attraction, there *is* evidence of specific body odors (MHC) being more or less attractive depending on genetics. However, MHC is not a pheromone.

This is what I inboxed, minus the 3 links since that're not allowed on this sub. Fun little research session."
I'm just saying it's unhealthy.
"Its not fair to hold onto someone just because ""you'll never find someone as great as him"".

There's clearly a disconnect between the two of you.  For whatever reason, be it life experiences, the ability to feel vulnerable with each other, the physical attraction, perspectives, your individual emotional landscapes and how those coincide... something is keeping you from feeling ""it"", and I think you owe him at least the courtesy of talking about how you feel, if not an outright breakup.  Imagine how you'd feel if the roles were reversed... "
"Your girlfriend is spending 5 days at a time in your apartment, at least twice a month. That is an extreme overstay. and your roommate was right to say something\- he should have brought it up with you, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. He was probably flustered in the moment and you are overthinking the way he went about this. Tell him your gf mentioned what he said and offer to increase your rent . "
She wasn't doing it with a guy though... Lots of men have an issue with other men and not other women. This is a new situation. They are just not compatible.
"My husband suffers from constant anxiety. It's a struggle to be supportive and also not let him take his stress and rantings too far that they ruin our time together. There's a line between being a supportive spouse and therapist. It does sound like you might benefit from a therapist, at least temporarily to help you gain perspective from a neutral third party.

*However,* your boyfriend sounds no so great. At this point in your life, you're probably looking for a life partner, someone you can count on in good times and bad times; it doesn't sound like he's there for the bad times. You're probably looking for someone you can lean on for support; it doesn't sound like he's willing to be your anchor when you need it. You're probably looking for an equal partner to stand beside you; it sounds like he wants to be wishy-washy and let someone else do the leading, and that's not a real partner, is it?

You have every right to want space in your relationship to fail, to question your decisions, to lack confidence, etc. Is he the person to provide you that space? Internet strangers won't be able to tell you the answer, but I bet a therapist can help you see things with clearer and more focused lenses. Good luck!"
"So, basically he is putting his carnal desires above you, your relation, and your mental health or he is throwing an adult sized temper tantrum because he can’t have sex? When my plate is full, sex is the last thing in my mind, and my husband realizes it. In these times, he digs a bit deeper and tries to take some burdens off of me. Having the time to do a little self care and self healing goes a long way to sexuality. Being forced to perform out of guilt and obligation is a sexuality killer. "
"As a petite lady in her 20s who has often been mistaken for a teenager I can say that it would get on my nerves and/or hurt my feelings if I learned that my SO’s friends *constantly* joked about my height and my baby face behind my back (it would be even worse if this was to my face). Especially if the comments were that us being together made my SO look like a creep at best or a criminal at worst. It’s not your GF’s fault that she’s short and picking on someone for something they can’t control like their height is just dumb and mean. 

I can totally tolerate a joke or two about my height from friends (heck I’ll usually be the first one to make height related jokes at my own expense!) but when it becomes a “thing” (especially with people I’m not close to) then it crosses the line from good natured ribbing to annoying, hurtful, and rude. 

Talk to your GF about it and see how she feels. If she’s just as bothered about it as you are definitely start calling your friends out when they make those comments and tell them that the joke has gotten super old and it isn’t funny. Though honestly since it bothers you this much (and since they’re dissing you as much as your GF) feel free to call them out anyways. Your GF is an adult and they need to stop comparing her to a child, this is beginning to cross the line into disrespectful. "

"I wouldn’t say the age difference was iffy if she was 21 and you were 25, but there is something about her being 18 and right out of high school that makes it different in my opinion. I am a teacher and I feel the same way about all the senior boys at my high school who start dating freshman girls. It’s unnerving. I know by 18 you’re considered an adult, but it’s still a vulnerable age and pursuing something with an 18 year old girl as a 22 year old man just seems predatory. That said, I’ve never seen you two interact. It might be a very respectful and loving feeling you have towards her and she might be very mature, and it could turn into a great relationship. But I think the idea of the age gap gives most people a feeling of uneasiness for the reasons above."

"It's not just the 3 nights a week for sports, she's also spending time away for hanging  out with her friends and family.  It doesn't sound as if she's spending much time at all with her kids.

"There have been a lot of cases where I've seen the one cheated on took it out on the stranger/affair partner rather than the cheater in the relationship as the line of thought would be if it weren't for the stranger, the cheating SO wouldn't have cheated.

"If I was one of your fat friends — or one of your thin friends who wanted to support your fat friends — I would not really care about his reasoning or backstory; I simply would not want to deal with that sort of toxicity. I would think less of you for dating him without holding him accountable to change, and I would try to avoid spending time with either of you."
"Half the battle is showing up. Literally if you're getting invites to events and not going or not texting people back that's going to kill you're social life. People are only willing to go so far for others, you have to put forth some effort too.

I don’t need to know the details or read the whole thing. You gave him permission. Yes you should. If you feel bad about giving him permission and regret it that’s another thing. You should feel regret for allowing this if you can’t handle it. If you give him grief for it you are wrong. You shouldn’t allow him to do it in the first place but you did so you can either choose to try and work through it or you can move on and learn from this mistake.

Honestly, I find it a bit creepy of Betty to expect she would have the same bond as OP has with Abby.

"I would leave because this is plotted, planned, and a manipulation tactic.

Instead of telling you in the early days of your relationship when you're more likely to leave it she hid this from you for all these years. She only tells you now after the guilt is overwhelming, **to her**, to relieve *herself* of the guilt she is feeling. Simultaneously she now has you in a position where you have 6 years of happiness together and she can say ""That was 6 years ago, are you just going to throw away our entire relationship over a mistake I made 6 years ago?""

She purposely let you engender all the affection, love, and close emotions you would feel for her over those 6 years and then tells you now not for any other reason but to make herself feel better about how terrible she is. Then she can sweep this under the rug and she will *never* have to feel any consequences for her actions. That's a great way to make sure she'll never do it again.

Simultaneously with the affair so far in the past how can you verify what she says is true about it? How can you verify that she didn't maintain the affair for 2-3 years of your relationship and sleep with this guy a bunch of times over the course of your relationship? I'm sure she's either switched phones or deleted any and all evidence long ago. For all you know she's admitting to it 6 years later but she could have been banging this dude hundreds of times over the course of 1-3 years of your relationship and you would not be able to verify if she's telling the truth at all because the affair happened so long ago. 

I wouldn't stay. This was planned, plotted, and a manipulation of your emotions. She didn't come to you repentant after it happened one time because she was drunk and beg your forgiveness and you knew this about her character before you got engaged. You had no idea she was a person who was capable of cheating, you stayed with her anyways, and now she's coming to you and won't even feel the affects or consequences of her actions.

If you don't break up with her at the very least end the engagement and move out for a period of time. She needs to see with no uncertain terms that her actions were profoundly unacceptable and she can't just do this and hide this from you. You want to be with this girl till death do you part. That is a lot of years for her to hide another affair from you. 

She's telling you right now about the quality of her character *listen to her*. The one thing I regret the most is not listening to my cheating ex girlfriend's warnings when she told me she cheated on me 1 year into our relationship. She cheated on me in the first 6 months of us being official. Instead of listening and saying ""Damn, if she can cheat 6 months in she can sure as hell cheat 4 years in."" Guess what happened? She did it again. 

*You already know who she is when it comes to infidelity.* Why would you want to stay?"
"LOL, why post on Reddit if you can't take criticism and suggestions? Why get super defensive and snap at everyone if you're supposedly so nonjudgmental and accepting? I haven't swore at you or used any strong language at all, but it sounds like a sore spot is hit. It seems like religion hasn't made you more humble, accepting, or loving towards fellow man in any way. Which affirms my initial suspicion all along, this really isn't about religion since neither of you are that into religion before the kid came along. Religious conflicts are less about one's own convictions and more about exerting control over others. Just look at history."

"&gt; I'm not a quitter, and I want to fight for us and our future.

Okay this is a thing that drives me nuts. It’s not “quitting” to take someone at their word. It’s not “quitting” to walk away from someone who says they don’t want to be with you. It’s not “quitting” to protect yourself from further hurt when someone has already harmed you. It’s common goddamn sense. Don’t chase people who don’t want you. No matter how much they enjoy you chasing them. 

It’s an extension of “if you ask someone out and they say no, BELIEVE THEM.” You can’t force someone to love you. Let him be, and grieve the relationship you thought you had. You’ll find it much easier to move on if you stop looking for hope and loopholes. "

"Because like she said, this was a 'policy' that was only applied to her. Just like when people who get pulled over are ticketed or not ticketed based on race instead of what they actually did or didn't do. As I said, it's a very common experience because a lot of racism is legal and socially acceptable so long as it comes with a plausible excuse. It's something that's happened to her or people she knows multiple times in life and conversely, it's something you don't see if it doesn't often happen to you or people you're close to. It's really hard to understand the impact living in a racist world has on people without experiencing it or listening to people who do.

People on the internet are weird.

"Abusers are typically very good at manipulating therapists who do not actually specialize in the field.   

Before you do anything else, read Lindsey Bancroft's *Why Does He Do That*.   It has some examples of how men game therapists.

You should not have to participate in a session with *his* therapist for that to happen.  He wants you there so that his therapist can tell you how you have messed up.

"You mention that when you left it was with the explanation that you weren't ready for a long term relationship, and that she anticipated this concern on your part and confidently gave you the space requested, alongside continued interactions shared when returning on breaks.

I presume that confidence she reasoned with was born of the shared feelings and experiences prior to your departure, as well as the obvious reassurances she must have felt from the continued liaisons during the regular breaks you returned home for (which likely seemed to her to feel centered around preserving your connection).

Given your admitted wild behavior when away at college, and the guilt behind your concern with these indiscreet friends, I wonder just how honest you were with your wife-to-be? She presumably waited back home under the impression that although your relationship was on hold, the regular intimacy you shared together surely fostered the potential in her mind (further cemented by the fact that she also lived with your family [with your encouragement] during these years in waiting). All of this to say that you certainly never dissuaded the likely future conclusion wherein her dreams (which for all intents and purposes seemed shared by you) would come to fruition.

As well, you knew yourself to be her only partner during this time, likely because she believed you were *both* still nurturing this relationship despite the space. All of this suggests she never considered your absence (from home, and from the relationship) to be anything more than you needing time to yourself.

You told us you never clarified that you'd be seeing other people. You likely never clarified that she was *not* your only sexual partner, *either*. You likey withheld this information intentionally to secure your position with her while you were away, and putting the responsibility of making assumptions about your behavior (with and without her) onto her shoulders is incredibly deceitful and manipulative. It had to be, too, because otherwise you know anything with your wife-to-be during those delicate years had the ability to wholly desolve.

You're afraid, and you should be. You should have been totally forthcoming with her from the start, and yet I doubt you'll tell her the whole truth now because there's *so* much more to lose.

That poor woman. "
"I'm sorry you are having to take all this in, OP, but I agree with the others saying it shouldn't change how you feel about the grandfather you knew and loved.  If he had stage 4 bone cancer I am guessing (having seen a friend pass away with that a couple of years ago) that he was in a lot of pain and knew it would only get worse.  He acted out of extreme pressure and a shocking new diagnosis, and did a brave and (to him) humane thing.  We don't know, any of us, what we are capable of until we are pushed to our limits.  Best wishes to you."
"She needs to find something to keep her occupied. Does she have any hobbies? How long have you two been together? Alone time is super important in long term relationships/marriages. I can’t say I blame you for being turned off by that.  That is something she needs to work on within herself, because she may have some underlying insecurities about herself or the relationship. "
"It sounds like her preening time IS how she relaxes. You can try for compromises on how much ""couple"" time you have, and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable compromise or not, and on how joint funds are spent, though."

"Without sounding awful, your wife seems to be the common denominator here, chances are it will be her shortcomings rather than a string of terrible bosses.

With project management and marketing your wife needs to ensure she has a comprehensive understanding from the start, if she is unclear she needs to send follow ups to clarify the points so everyone is on the same page. She needs to identify opportunities and potential issues as well within the client brief where she can get a jump on any problems that may crop up. 
If a large part of her job is hitting deadlines (and I’m guessing being on budget is also a factor here) and she is overrunning projects it’s a huge flag for bosses and clients, no one wants to work with someone who takes twice as long and in effect will cost you more money. 
If she enjoys her job and wants to sick with it, she could start by asking for constructive criticism, ask her boss how she can improve and what they expect of her. She could look into training as well, PRINCE is usually a good one that a lot of marketers use to roll out projects. "
"I think she should change the locks, if she can. I wouldn't be surprised if they've already made a copy."
"There's got to come a time where you respect what she's saying to you. You've had at least two conversations about it where she's turned you down (gay or not, it doesn't matter) and is now distancing herself from you. If she wanted to be with you, she would be by now.

If you want one more shot of trying then go for it, so you're not left wondering, but be prepared to give her space after if she says no."
"I understand (as a mother of four) that having a baby is very draining and does shift the relationship. But you need him in your corner, not withdrawing. 

Having a break is not normal and he is trying to normalise it to you. 

It can be hard with a baby to have a ‘fun’ life; but the fun now is the baby and the little family you’ve become. He needs to realise this. 

It seems like you’re really trying and the fact you want to spend time with him and would go out is lovely, but if he’s unwilling that’s not much help to you. 

He is becoming an extra job to you, for you to deal with when you have a baby already. 

Spending time with you and your baby is not a chore and you are not a drain. It’s not about YOU, it’s his bad attitudes. 

I’d like to suggest you really think about if you need a relationship like this, if you deserve it and if your daughter deserves it. (I don’t actually say this often). "
"I remember the first time my son slept theough the night. It was so magical...

"I don’t think you should date anyone for awhile after this, OP, but rather take some time to yourself. For some reason you feel guilty saying “no” when this guy has told you he wants to postpone your breakup so he can use you for sex one more time. You’re a human being, not an object to be used and thrown away. Please seek therapy."
Start looking for employment elsewhere and once that's secured break up with her 
"You should leave her.   
She deserves to be with someone that thinks she's the most beautiful thing in the world. 

Physical attraction is very important in a relationship, and if you don't feel it, you should indeed break up with her.   
Having said that, you sound very self\-absorbed and arrogant by saying that this girls is too ugly for you. The issue should be that you're not attracted to her and NOT whether society will perceive you as better\-looking than her. Caring about this makes you sound vain. "
I got married in a courthouse and went out to eat after. I don't regret it - and even if I do some day I find it hard to hold malice toward my younger self for doing what was right for me at the time. Your parents are the ones that ruined their change at making *their* dream wedding for you a reality. It's not your fault. Take the situation and do what *you* want with it because YOU are the one getting married.
"Abusive relationships are basically the sole edge case where “cheating,” an act granted negative moral value because you’re breaching someone’s trust, doesn’t matter. Your relationship with your ex was already over long before you met your current boyfriend and instead of framing it as you cheating, you should correctly frame it as you escaping an abusive situation with his help. 

See a therapist, OP. "
"God I so wish OP's boyfriend could find this post and read OP's responses in the comments. 

He'd dump her straight away and she can be besties with Kaitlin... Everyone wins."
This is your reaction to someone saying to proceed with caution?
"Ask what events are child\-free.  This way, you'll get a chance to mingle with family but won't disrupt ""official"" wedding events with a baby.  I went to my niece's wedding in April with a 7 month old.  The bride clarified that kids/babies were welcome at the ceremony, but not the reception and rehearsal dinner.  So we took him to the ceremony, everyone passed him around while the bridal party took pictures, then we left before the reception started."
"He's 22. He still has a lot of growing to do. If you asked me this morality question when I was 22 I probably would have said something similar. 22 year olds typically don't have a lot of world experience and over idealize things. Now I'm 32 and I understand OP's perspective a lot more. 

For what it's worth I think it's a bit harsh to say ""I hope you're not planning on having children with this man"" because just as OP has pointed out, people can change. Hopefully her boyfriend can as well. Sometimes having children changes people, because you realize you would do anything to protect them.

Edit: I misread ages, my apologies! And while I understand that having children in the hope that it will change someone is a *terrible* idea, my point is that major happenings in a person's life can change them. I think it's premature to dismiss anyone's potential to do X based on an isolated reddit relationship post, especially when the subject of having children wasn't even mentioned in the original post. "
You ARE justifying what he did. By saying “I don’t think this is breakup worthy” you’re justifying violent physical contact with a romantic partner. 
"Not just amateurs, amateurs with an Agenda."
I haven't asked him directly why he does everything for his son. I'm sure he thinks that's the best way he can parent. I've explained to him that it's not his job to make his son happy. It's his job to give him the tools/structure he needs to become an adult. But it turns into an argument because he says he knows best for his son and I don't have credibility because I don't have kids of my own. 
"From some of your answers it sounds like she keeps a lot of things from her parents because they are emotionally abusive and can't be trusted. 

She probably assumes your parents can't be trusted either. Have a talk with her when she cools down about what she would be comfortable with you talking about her with your parents, and what is off limits. If she wants you to give your parents no information whatsoever then you need to know that. 

If your parents are perfectly normal nice people with good motives, then it will probably be nice for her to have them in her life once she gets to know them a bit better. It sounds like her own parents are not that great. "
"Ughhhhhhh. It's just 3mos dude, find someone you are more compatible with. "
"Unless her degree is in the hospitality industry, then maybe she feels embarrassed for not having an internship or a job that will add value to her resume.  Some people put a lot of pressure on getting a relevant internship during undergrad.  Not saying I agree that she should still keep that a secret, but that might be what she's thinking."
"I understand. I'm also trying to get the r/relationships opinion on this since it is involved with family members. I don't want to hurt the relationship, but this older cousin of mind has no understanding or forgiveness when it comes to finances. She is normally very nice, and an angel. BUT becomes an evil machine when it comes to money (as I've heard from other family members). No forgiveness. It's her one quirk. If I had to sum it up, her thought process is: ""You break it, you WILL reimburse me the money"""
How far are you supposed to let it escalate before the abuse becomes break-up worthy?
"Please quit with the bisexuals are predators mindset.

"If she had said something like ""With how much you travel, I often get worried about your safety.  It would be reassuring to know that if you don't come home I could see where you're at and that you're safe"".  However, her inability to vocalize any logical reason for wanting it throws up big red flags for me.

Pause the wedding.  Pause the engagement.  Slow down and really look at your relationship.  You have every right to ask for an answer as to why she wants that on your phone."

Stick to the way it’s affecting customers and your comfort in the office. 

“People think we have a dead fish”, “the tank smells and it makes me sick to my stomach”...."
I agree. OP is acting like a massive doormat here.
What about moving to a place that has more martial arts training options? Drastic I know but it does kill both birds with one stone.

OK, don't do this again. You're just telling him that if he bugs you enough you'll give in.

"OP has admitted that yes, there have been girls in the group that were mean to Jess (but downplayed it), and that Erin was bitter and salty towards Jess when Jess tried to be pleasant upon their first meeting. It’s not Jess’s fault that Jake didn’t want to marry Erin, nor is it her fault that Jake decided to move on. Erin and her close friends haven’t been mature at all, and have taken out Erin’s pettiness and bitterness on the wrong target. Do I think everyone in the group deserves to be vilified? No, and I said that. But do I think that Jess has been mistreated? Absolutely."

"If I was the best man in this story I would bail on the wedding.  You have a girl who is totally innocent who you admit got treated with open hostility during the weekend by a cliquey group of friends.  And through that lens ALL of her issues are understandable.  When treated with hostility by a sub-set of a group, you aren't going to want to freely associate with that group.

You aren't the good guy here in my opinion, and I haven't even heard their side of this.  "

"When my grandmother died, she left me some really nice heirlooms, including a set of antique bone china with zero flaws. This kind of stuff is exceedingly expensive, and add in a flawless antique with an actual goddamn 1920s receipt?? Probably priceless, in all honesty. In the will there was a value next to it and I wanna say it was like $5k but my mind was blown over how tea cups could be worth that much. 

So, what do I do? Do I yank it out and show it off for guests? Hell NO: lock that shit up like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park and pray no one ever asks me about so I have to risk using it. Someday my daughter will do the same. It’s the only reasonable way to keep a full expensive tea set in good condition. 

OP’s cousin is a madwoman. "
"Yep, ""nice guys"" will decide on their own what criteria a woman must have for selecting a partner. They either select criteria that they themselves meet, or will argue that they have met them. 

When rejected, they act like the woman is a hypocrite for not choosing to date him, as if she came up with criteria, had an agreement to select a man based on those criteria, and then broke that agreement, costing him time, money and effort.

Never mind that as you said, attraction doesn't work that way. I could declare, ""I wanna date tall men who are creative and have a good sense of humour, and it doesn't hurt if he has a pet rabbit!"" and then be completely disinterested in a guy who has those attributes."
"Ultimatums are, generally, just an expression of a hard boundary, and it is absolutely OK to have hard boundaries. 

By OP telling her husband he has to get help and quit his *drug addiction* and put effort into fixing their relationship or she's out, she's not saying ""I control you. Do this or I leave. Muahahaha, feel my abuse."" She's saying ""Hey, I'm unhappy. Here is my hard boundary. I'm not willing to be with someone who's addicted to drugs, making unhealthy choices, and putting 0 effort into our relationship. If you're not willing to get help, kick the habit, and put effort into yourself and our relationship again, then this relationship no longer works for me.""

It's also worth noting, OP's husband is the one who's made it so there's no room for compromise. He's the one who said ""I either quit cold turkey or I'm an every day smoker, no in between."" "

"Man, I've been Jess. My ex had a network of friends through all of his jobs (different companies, same industry) and I remember he would get annoyed/confused/critical if I didn't just jump in because that was completely opposite of my nature. He had a few jerky friends too who would call a ton of attention to it so on top of not knowing how to fit in, I had a spotlight on me that more or less made it widely known that I wasn't fitting in. It sucks."
"&gt;These frustrations were told to him and my mom in confidence and with the understanding that they would never be told to my husband—at least not by them. For the most part they are your standard marriage grievances: differences of opinion, annoying habits, differences in perspective, etc. I go to my parents to vent sometimes.

Do not do this. **Ever**.

Your husband has every reason not to trust you or your parents because he found out that you've been going around complaining about him behind his back and now your father has gone and stuck his nose where it didn't belong using information he shouldn't have had and you've got a blowup on your hands. Congratulations, this entire situation is your fault. 

You want to make things right? Start by offering your husband a *very* sincere apology for complaining about him to your parents and promise him that you will never, ever, do it again. Tell your parents that what you realize you fucked up and that you need to pull back with the details of your marriage that you share with them. Tell your father he overstepped his bounds and that the next time he wants to offer ""sage advice"" to your husband that he needs to zip it. 

You've got work to do if you want to regain your husband's trust, and part of that is establishing better boundaries with your parents. "
"Yeah, I have Dyspraxia and it took me till my late 20s to realise I need lists to stop me getting distracted every second. The moment i step away from a task it's gone unless I have a written reminder.

It would do help explain why this keeps happening, symptoms you might have overcome or grown out of will come back with a vengeance under stress and i imagine she's probably permanently stressed at this point."
How is she able to land so many jobs?  Most employers would not be happy with someone that job hops. 
"Just think of what your life is going to be like when you get out of college and can move far far away from them! You're going to be a functional adult who can manage her own money, take care of her own needs, find her own housing, live her own life.

So...who really wins?"
"Yeah. I hate to be mercenary about it but- grandma doesn't pay, grandma doesn't get invited to graduation."
"Most of your responses seems quite negative. Almost everything suggested gets shot down for one reason or another. If you always have a reason not to do something than you're not going to find something you can do together. 

Go for a walk every evening. 

You said he doesn't pick up the book when you're supposed to be reading together, next time get him to pick the book. It's your hobby but he gets to pick something that interests him so you both win. 

There's definitely way more board games you can explore. Ask on r/boardgames. Also compromise, if you don't like a certain game but he does play it occassionally and vice versa. 

If you want to go rock climbing start saving. Put a little money aside every week and then when you've got enough try it out. Try bouldering as it doesn't need so much equipment or supervision and therefore is cheaper. I've been and it was about £7 to hire the shoes and a couple of quid to use the wall. I know that won't be the same everywhere, but seriously just save up. 

Try out a new restaurant together. Play tourists in your own town/city, look up the top ten attractions/things to do and do them. 

u/ziaryx suggested playing overcooked, definitely try it, it's a great game and a whole lot of fun. 

Do things seperately but together. My partner and I will often sit reading our own books or he'll play a game whilst I knit or whatever. Just check in with each other from time to time to maintain a connection. 

A great game my partner and I play together occassionally is to draw a made up creature in 1 minute. Then you get to ask each other 20 questions about the others drawing. After that you have to draw what you think the other persons creature looked like. It's really funny, requires no artistic talent and very little equipment. 

You don't have to share a hobby every day or even every week or at all. You can do plenty of things together to connect that are not full on hobbies. "
You either cut off your friend or be honest with your girlfriend and break up with her.
"Are you kidding me??? Kids meals have less food! When I eat fast food I try to get kids meals to be healthy, because the amount of food in a regular meal is very UNHEALTHY. And you're judging her for this?

Then promptly dump him and move on with your life.  What a bunch of dead weight.
"That's a semi-normal thing to happen in a relationship.  As the newness of it wears off, a certain familiarity and comfort level comes in, and the sex slows down.

About the only thing you can do about it as a guy, is try to be a bit more romantic and less mechanical about sex.  Try taking her out on a more formal ""date"" from time to time, a candle lit dinner, dress up and whatnot."
"I agree that he can end the relationship if he's not okay with the difference in views/values.  There are plenty of people out there who are only okay with monogamy and it's fine for him to desire that in a partner! I was just disagreeing that being open to nonmonogamy is equivalent to cheating.  It's sort of like being *open* to not eating meat isn't equivalent to being a vegetarian, if that makes sense?  "
upvote for 'as fluff'
"&gt;I don’t have anyone to help me pick a car as I don’t know much

Going to dealerships to look around is just the first step.  Go to a couple of dealerships and check out the models that interest you. 

 Then go home and do some research on the internet.  You can usually get a better deal if you go through somewhere like Costco or the Auto Club (which as a single woman, you probably want to join).   You also want to check out financing though somewhere other than the dealership -- a credit union is usually a good start.  You will also need insurance so get a couple of quotes from different companies so you'll be ready once you buy.  Again, the AutoClub might be a place to start.

If you don't know much about cars, you can also ask some of your co-workers.  Mention that you want to buy a car and you'll get all sorts of advice from the guys.  Pay a bit more attention to advice you get from married people who usually have to do more work to balance the car with other family requirements.

Don't talk to your boyfriend about it anymore.  If he asks, just say you aren't quite ready yet.  Don't mention getting advice from anyone else and don't try to get him interested.  Just go and look.  Take your time, this is a big deal and once you sign, you should be confident that *you* did the best for yourself.

BTW, most of the time a 2 or 3 year old car is a much better deal than brand new.  Sometimes credit unions have cars they have had to repossess that can be very good deals.   "
"Holy yikes. Well at least she is rid of this dude. (And seriously... they started dating when he was 36 and she was 17!?!)

Get the police involved with the threats. Take him to court on the money that is owed (if possible in the country you live in). Get a restraining order too, if possible.

Also, why did you buy the washing machine if you only rent the house? Shouldn't that be the landlord's duty?"
I'd be really leery about smudging. A lot of Christians believe this/new-age stuff in general is occult (or at least sinful) because it's a spiritual practice that is outside of Christianity. I don't think she'd be receptive to it.

"Exactly! I have missed flights before, and in once instance I knew driving to the airport that I was going to miss it (blow out tire in BFE North Carolina!), but you still go and see what the agent at the counter can do for you. That time I was just placed on the next flight going there for no charge. In instances where we missed connections, they just put you on the next one and if it's not til the next day, try to get you out on the first one. The worst is they tell you to go away or call the hotline. "
"That's the perfect thing to say. Just enough information, definitely don't unnecessarily include details about how ""it was only sex"" or anything like that, I personally wouldn't want that mental image put in my head.  Good luck OP, let us know how it goes! Hopefully you two can move past it, nobody did anything wrong here. "
TLDR: Please find a healthy and stable living environment for yourself and your wife/kids. This is just chaos and you need time away from it. 
"Yeah idk. I wouldn’t trust him. I’m not sure that the moaning/trying to wake you up even happened. 
It seems very fishy to go through someone’s phone using probable cause that they were unconscious for. He was being so affectionate afterwards because he knows it’s not cool. 

What did he find that he didn’t like? 

Did he give any additional details about the dream? 

Have you thought about asking for his phone to let him know how this invasion of privacy feels? I would say “Can I go through your phone? It’s only fair.” You don’t have to actually do it, but if you decide not to, then say “see it feels weird and bad. I think you owe me an apology” 

He absolutely manipulated this situation. "

Getting physical with fights EVER, EVEN ONE TIME = deal breaker

Yes, this dude is a mess but you are ALSO a mess if you think any part of this relationship was okay or normal. You don't fight all the time in good relationships. You don't break up and get back together over and over in a good relationship. You don't scream at each other. You don't have communication skills if you think fighting like you were is okay. You need help. "

"&gt; You can be skilled at your work, but it's not unusual for men to be considered ""difficult but brilliant"", whereas women are just considered ""difficult.""

Yeah, I was wondering if this was the case.

It seems strange she's been unable to improve - presumably if she went to college etc she would have gotten grades, feedback, etc. It also could be people are giving unhelpful feedback of ""do better"" without actually trying to work out where she stumbled or struggles.

Alternatively, it could be a moving goalposts problem - they ask her to do X, she does X, then gets criticised for not doing X+Y."

The best employees take accountability, are self aware, and are cognizant of their weaknesses while setting goals to overcome.

Three different employment ops is pretty telling.  And assuming it’s because she turned down sexual advancements at THREE places is ridiculous. "
"I agree with the other commenters that he's likely trickle truthing you and you really need to get tested for your own sake. One argument I've heard men make is ""it's not cheating if you paid for it"" and I figured I would warn you in advance in case he tries to use that on you (the first time I heard it my jaw dropped to the floor and I got really angry). Remember this wasn't his buddies pressuring him to get a lap dance on the spot, he actively chose to cheat on you, then hide it from you for months. You're still young, you deserve to be with someone who loves and respects you."
I just meant in comparison to the demanding engineering field she had previously been doing. Didn’t mean to come across as dismissive and should have chosen the wording better

"Even if you DID have a sexual dream about your friend (which is doubtful - I'm on the ""BF is making that up to justify snooping"" bandwagon), that's not you doing something wrong - it's a meaningless dream, it's not cheating, it's not an indication you were even thinking about cheating or that you're attracted to your friend - it's a random DREAM that means nothing, and is nothing to apologize for, nothing that needs to be ""forgiven."" 

You are right to not trust your BF, because he is manipulating you - trying to get you to think that you did something that needs to be forgiven."
My money’s on the latter hahaha. That’s what I immediately thought 
"I mean, he's obviously not ""nicer"" given what he did with you when you were drinking. I'm curious, do you have low self esteem? Because you can do much better than this guy."
"If everyone were great communicators this sub wouldn't exist. Sure you can see it as an outright manipulation and some of it might be. Chances are though a good ammount of it is I'm concerned there is 0 career progression opportunity right now. Nothings getting cheaper in this country, Ford just outright stopped selling cars in the US. Cars are getting more and more modular, autonomous driving is on the way. Electric everything is on the way. If OP is going to a dealership every day to crank out warranty work, or even worse and independent shop thats not really up on the changes. His wife is going to be concerned. Hell I'm concerned for my cousin thats a master Ford mechanic that just went back to dealerships from an independant shop. It's tough out there in the wrenching business."
"This is an unpopular thing to say on this sub (and reddit in general), but it's true whether or not people want to admit it.

You do not have to live together with someone before marriage to see if things will work out. I can understand why someone would want to, but it's not a make or break situation. If you really love this woman, it shouldn't be the deciding factor on whether or not you marry her."
And might also get fat if he sits behind a desk all day. 
"&gt;  I feel like I'm choosing between growing up and just falling under their control.

That's exactly what is happening.  This is a pivotal moment in your life.  It's up to you to decide it's outcome."
"Exactly. It's very reductive, you're a whole human being with thoughts and feelings and motivations that are entirely your own. Of course your loss has influenced you, but it's not your whole being. It seems like a way that she can pretend to be a caring and sympathetic person, but not actually listen to you or understand your perspective. I'm sure she feels like it lets her off the hook for her manipulation, like you're not qualified to make life decisions and she knows what's best.

I'm sorry that someone is twisting a tragic life event and jabbing you with it. I'd want to hit anyone who was constantly bringing it up. ""Hey, did you forget that you don't have living parents?"" Who does that?"
"Nope. If you move before the baby is born, you’re golden. If you wait until after, you’ll have to hash it out in the courts. If you want to leave and be with your family, do it now. "
"Don't even worry about it. I know it's abusive to my wellbeing and my anxiety issues arose from being so dependent on them. It's going to be hard, but I hope it's worth it."
"@ doesn't work here. You want to use /u/

The dude isn't harassing you, yet. But it is worrysome that he kept coming back after you were very clear (screaming) that you wanted to be left alone. Most people would gtfo in those situations."
"Been in your shoes. What happened in my case was actually we got back together around five times before she just decisively broke up with me.

Those five times we broke up and got back together were very hard, very hurtful. I wished we just had stopped seeing each other.

Try just taking a deep breath, and focus on something else. Either a videogame, a podcast, exercising, even going out for a walk.

She told me the same as yours did: I want to be alone. And that was a bold faced lie. 

Even if you want a relationship she may have a different idea for you, i honestly recommend that you guys keep being friends, but you just keep your feelings on check. No use just moping around for one person. "
"My take on it is DO NOT GET TO KNOW HIM.

Honestly, if I was a hustler I'd target you.  You have nothing to gain from this man except some insight on how to beg and live on the streets, both of which you don't want to know about first hand."
"I had a similar situation. I would break up with her man, there are better women out there that will treat you better. "
"Adderall user here. I wanted to mention medicine of any kind is not supposed to be kept in the bathroom because of the steamy showers. It degrades the pills.
"
"No, it sounds like normal anxiety and insecurities, just sounds deep-rooted. I think talking to a professional would just help untangle the web of thoughts and get you back to a self-assured place. It doesn't sound life-ruining, just like it's holding you back mentally. 

There is a lot more to a person than what you wrote here. Your boyfriend surely loves your soul, something no-other human being shares with you, no matter how similar two people are. People are so attractive because of many different reasons."
"This reminds me of my brother's experience with his ex. They were together for a couple of years and my family was very fond of her. When they broke up, she and my mom still talked, and she would often talk to us on Facebook. She wasn't after my brother (she was married with children and seemed very happy at this point). She just really appreciated how we treated her as part of the family. I liked her and my brother's new girlfriend. 

Im pretty sure that's how your fiance's family sees this too. She's a friend and became a part of their lives. Don't delude yourself into thinking that his family thinks of her as ""the one who got away"". Give yourself more credit. 

Did you start any drama about the ex? I mean, have you talked about this to anyone aside from your fiance? I think it's never too late to be friends with the ex and to know her better. "
"This line of reasoning makes sense. But so does the other way. 

OPs mom is missing pills that she needs for her back. Bf just had surgery and is presumably just ""in more pain"" than the pills can relieve. Like, if the mom is innocent what else is she going to do? Insist bf has a drug problem after 3 weeks? Kick him out? Just live with pain? Or insist he stop taking hers and refill his own?  I'd be pissed and agitated too if I couldn't trust my medication wouldn't go missing.

Really does sound like mom is doing it with her behavior, but there's no guarantee. "
You need to talk to your wife about this. 
That’s what I think too.
"I don't normally like to pull this card, but I can't help but feel that if OP were a woman who's partner was a man who refused to shower, and instead berated OP for 30+ hours a week for not wanting to have sex with him, the comments would be *very* different."
"Being in my 30s, I can tell you that when I review résumés/CVs for job applicants, I don't care about grades.  Including grades is usually done by those who are either finishing their degree or have recently finished (unless they have something to prove); you typically won't see someone include their GPA after they've had a couple of jobs to list.  In my field (and I imagine in most other fields), it is more valuable to find a candidate who knows ***how*** to think rather than ***what*** to think.

Do you know what people call the student who has the lowest passing GPA in med school?

Doctor.

Edit: This is in the US."
Exactly this. OP frequently laments the fact that he isn’t listening to her....but the issue isn’t that he’s not listening. He is listening and hearing her just fine. He is just purposefully choosing to ignore what she says. OP deserves SO much better.

"You guys got married and you became a team. You both have to support that team and him quitting his paying job for just a random idea is not contributing to the team.

Out of curiosity, does he pay child support? What would happen with that if he just quit his job?

Agree with everyone else saying he's immature \- I doubt people get any personal fulfillment out of cleaning toilets or sweeping trash, they do it to make a living and support their family. It's what adults do. He's an adult and he has obligations to himself, you and his child. He can't just quit because it's hard and expect you to pick up the slack.

Besides, coming up with an idea is not a business plan; same way having a great idea for a book doesn't make a best\-seller. If he was serious about any of these ideas, he'd actually put some work in \- do the research, come up with a business model, get investors, etc etc etc. Maybe do an evening class for an MBA or finance degree. He would come up with a way for him to start a business which is the least possible risk to your family so it's actually a viable option and not a pipe dream. He's not going to do this though because I imagine he's more attached to the label of a guy who has so many great ideas but no one understands his genius rather than wanting to put in all the graft. And starting a business is hard work, especially for the first few years \- he's not going to get any of those benefits he wants for years and years even if the business was a success.

Do you see this relationship lasting another five years like this?"
"So... how can you trust this guy to build a life together if he can't hold down a job? His spotty work history is a red flag to any employer and your husband has made it clear that providing for the household in some way isn't a priority for him. Tell him he needs to get a job or contribute to the household in some other way or you're leaving him. Otherwise, you will end up resenting him (if you aren't resenting him already)."
"For expecting a female partner that defies age while you will age and look like a rotted potato. You’re expecting more from women than you expect from yourself or that you’ll ever be able to give. You value women based on stereotypes. 100% stereotypes. 

Also, you don’t like Asian women. You like light skinned women from some East Asian countries. Those are radically different things "
Op I’m so sorry for what you’re going through. please talk to your children and sister about what’s going on.  And please don’t leave them alone in the home with someone occasionally ‘checking in’.  Yes it’s wonderful that they will be able to handle the financial aspect but just because you feel like a friend doesn’t change the fact that you’re their only living parent.  Think of the long term effects of going from having a present and involved parent to being alone.  They’re going to need someone to keep them steady.  
There are a bunch of threads in the legaladdvice sub from young adults who had accounts that their parents could access. The parents spend all the money or they take the money the moment the adult child does something they don’t like.

"You both should have fun money, money the other person has **ABSOLUTELY NO SAY** in how it's used.  If you or he wants to burn the money in the grill, so be it.  "
"Being an adult also means communicating.  It doesn't seem like his wife is doing anything other than shoving this job at him.  Maybe if she would actually express her concerns, it would be easier for him to understand.  Or maybe he just straight up ask her what's on her mind.

That said, even if his employer doesn't have a 401K plan, he could start an IRA for additional retirement money.  He doesn't need a new job just for that.

Last thing I was thinking, there ARE ways for mechanic to advance, if he's interested.  He could move up to supervisor or manager in a larger business.  If he's in a smaller shop now, maybe that means heading to a dealership or something.

There are definitely options to address many of the future-planning issues that don't necessarily take him away from a career he loves.  Let me tell you, I have all those things, but some days I just want a job that doesn't piss me off 50 times a day.
"
I'd be willing to bet this is some sort of sibling competition between her and her sister.  (I'm assuming that this is her sister's husband that offered the job.)
"Even if it was only an unrequited/unexpressed crush, her sister and this guy have history. As a sibling getting involved with someone your brother or sister has history with is a risky idea, the potential for hurt is massive. OP should have spoken to her sister about it before it got this serious, and asked if she would be okay with it. If the sister said she isn't okay with it then OP could still pursue the guy if she wanted, but at least with everything in the open, and without blindsiding anyone involved.

Honestly though, unless you have a sibling whose a modern Casanova, the rule of ""Don't date anyone my siblings have been involved with"" only narrows your dating pool a tiny bit, and can prevent a lot of drama and heartache."
"If you want revenge, that's how you get it. But it may not be the best course of action for OP. That may make getting child support very difficult. Lower the pitchfork for a second and think about how these actions impact OP."
"Yep, I think it’s disrespectful to tell other women that you want to date or have sex with them if you are married. Moreover, his reasons for doing so are also innappropriate- he wants to make a female coworker feel better about hitting on him, a married coworker.

I think a loyal response in this situation would have been, “WTF? You know I’m married. This is completely innappropriate. Let’s make sure our interactions are purely professional from now on.”"
I'm glad you both also have wonderful partners &lt;3
"What if the two of you were friends and parted on fairly good terms? I mean, wouldn't that be the ideal situation (as opposed to tears and screaming matches and someone burning your stuff on your lawn at 3 in the morning)? 

If I dated a guy who nuked every single relationship with his exes, I'd start wondering what exactly happened in those relationships--and just what was the determining factor for them breaking up. "
"Holy crap. Seriously if you can't communicate with your girlfriend about something this minor, you shouldn't be getting married.  

Why are you on Reddit asking for advice?  This is your decision.  You were planning to propose.  If you decide to stick with your original proposal plan, just flat tell her you are planning to propose to her soon, but not on this vacation.  Or propose on the vacation, who actually cares?  You were planning to ask her.  Literally, people put more effort into their idiotic proposal plan and wedding than they do into their actual marriage these days.

Can you move in with your father? 
"Wow, what an astonishing lack of self-awareness your miserable father has. He just outright, unashamedly demands ""me, me, me!"". Like a spoiled brat. Who would want to be with someone like that?! I'd certainly prioritize traveling over hanging around that selfish kill-joy. That email was one big whine-fest of major entitlement and self-absorption. Yeah, it's tough when your spouse has health issues but that's what you sign up for when you get married - in sickness and in health, and all that.

Your priority is your husband and your marriage.  Don't give into your dad's whining. If you do, your marriage could be at risk. And neither should your husband be expected to alter his career path for that miserable whiner."
"Show him some pics of female Fortune 500 CEOs. Those ladies are generally sporting full faces of makeup. Light makeup is 100% professional.

You can politely ask him if there's an official dress code, so that you can be sure you're in compliance, and then tell him that as long as you're compliant and your behavior is professional, you'll continue to dress in the way that makes you most comfortable."
"Thank you for saying he has an alcohol problem. My boyfriend is a sad/aggressive drunk and has been totally sober for 8 months now. If you don't have to deal with the fallout of his drinking, then you don't get to laugh/provoke him. "
"She’s fucking him dude, pull your head out of your ass. Go talk to a lawyer and end this - she has zero respect for you."
"&gt;she thinks it was fucked up that she simply didn't like her SO's art, and she was ashamed of that.

She loves him and didn't want to see his art as bad. We see our loved ones through a lens of affection.  It's like the cliche guy whose GF keeps asking ""do I look fat in this dress?"" He may genuinely not see her as fat, or he may see that it's an unflattering dress but doesn't want to have to look at her critically.

If she goes and photoshops an unflattering picture of her body onto someone else's face and then asks him to critique that woman, it's hurtful not just because she's manipulated him, but also because she's forced him to see her flaws through a new lens."
"You have literally stated that you have known other people who have asked someone they admired to be a sperm donor. You seem to have it in your head that because other people do it then it should work out for you.

I think you’ve built this relationship up in your head and there are things there that you are misinterpreting. I would bet money that the only thing between the two of you is air. This thinking is very inappropriate and will still be inappropriate after you are no longer his student. He probably has things about his life he never told you and guess what you’re not privy to that information. You’re making assumptions. Take the rose colored glasses off and start acting like an adult and not some lovesick teenager. "
Maybe /r/exmuslim is better for this as many people on that sub will have been in the same situation as you.
"No, he needs to get over it. I'm a dude. "
"Ok so first off, like with all insecurities about ""measuring up to ex's"" understand this is your problem not hers. She isn't gushing about him, she is grieving and it is a perfectly understandable thing for her to be doing under the circumstances. And it seems like you understand this, I just wanted to reiterate it.

Ways you can think of this to help you get over it:

She is literally the person she is now, in part due to how she met, lived with, and interacted with this guy. The person you love is a complicated person, and shards of that person are part of made up of the interactions she had with her ex. You would likely not be with her in the way you are now if not her for past relationship with him.

Secondly, you wouldn't pretend to have any degree of agency over her life before you got together with her, so why is this any different? This is more about you wondering if he never died would she still choose you. And that isn't a question worth asking because the reality is, he isn't here, and she is choosing you. It's up to you to decide if that is enough, or important enough for you to move forward with your relationship. If it isn't, if you HAVE to know if you're her #1, dump her now and move on. Because you're wasting both of your time if you can't get over this.

To touch on crying randomly, I don't experience grief in the way your girlfriend does, and it sounds like you do't either. That said we can both awknowlage that some people do, and their grief isn't any less real then our grief. If it's only been 3 years, AND she discovered the body? I find it completely plausible that she still cries on days that reminds her of him. That doesn't make her feelings any less real for you. It is important to remember, it is not your right to decide what she feels or if what she feels is real. The only thing you do, is accept what she feels, and decide if that is enough for you.

If it isn't. that's ok. Some people require that assurance in their relationship that they are their partners EVERYTHING. That is a completely valid feeling to have as long as both adults consent to that. But it seems this guy will hold a portion of her heart for the rest of her life. And personally if my SO had someone like that, i could live with it. If you can't that doesn't mean anything other then you two have a compatibility issue. It isn't anyone's fault. it just means you need to move on."
"Amen to all of this, especially the last part. And buy a new toy just for you!"
"I found out that my dad was taking creep shots of women on holiday with his family, he was literally doing it as his daughters and wife were standing with him. I can't ever look at him the same way."
What is honeymoon-like about work trips?
"It sounds like she's gaslighting. I doubt anything you do to ""smooth things over"" will result in peace vs. further escalation. If she has a reputation as a pot\-stirrer, you'd do well to give up any ideas of being able to communicate with her as you would a neurotypical person. Treat every interaction carefully, don't try to smooth anything over when she perceives a non\-existent slight (just gives her more ammo), and maintain those boundaries. It sounds like he knows how his mom is \- dealing with her in regards to y'all's relationship is his job. "
"Unfortunately, his kids are not the droids he's looking for."
"In my experience people don't fuck people they aren't attracted to.  Especially not 5-7 times a week, my best suggestion is work on not taking things so personally.

Ask him point blank if this has anything to do with his ex-con status.
"This!!!!

...my daughter isn't even my SOs biological kid and he STILL gets up sometimes in the middle of the night with her. Especially if I have to get up early for work. 

And he picks her up from daycare and watches her alone (gasp....men can actually parent children alone!) For a few hours till I get off work since he works p/t and is a f/t student he has a more flexible schedule to hang and parent her when I'm working late or have to go in early.

When I hear women say ""he doesn't help"" I'm just like why waste your time with that shit? That's not a man or a spouse that's another chikd using you as a servant. Either get counseling and get him to do his share or split and do it yourself."
"It's most likely her illness and poor self-esteem, but she might also be comfortable with her weight and all it's problems it brings. But she sorta crossed a line for wishing harm onto you, what with telling you she perferred you eating unhealthy and not being active.

She might possibly benefit with another therapist and medication, but that's up to her for seeking out treatment."
"yeah this.  What OP posted sounds like Patrick is posting memes and venting in general, and not specifically.

"&gt; We decided that I would try to get rid of my PCOS and work together.

What kind of bullshit is this? There is no magic cure for a chronic medical condition like PCOS, only treatment and management. Do you think all the other women that have PCOS have it because they didn’t try hard enough to just magically “get rid of it”?!

Your boyfriend is selfish, immature and unemathetic, he’s not the sort of person you should want to build a long term future with. Life is never “perfect”, there are always curveballs and obstacles to overcome, medical, financial, and in 1000 other ways. Getting married and raising a family together means that you stick together and support each other through those, not bail on your partner. It’s not even like PCOS makes you infertile so by staying with you he gives up all chance to have his own biological child. It will just be harder and might require IVF or other treatments. If he loved you that would be worth it. 

Your PCOS isn’t ruining your relationship, it’s showing you your boyfriend’s true colours and character, and it’s not a pretty sight. He’s already broken up with you twice and is now setting you the ludicrous and unachievable task of “getting rid of your PCOS” to stay together. Break up with this loser and stay broken up, you can do so much better. Please consider therapy to work on your own self-respect and self-esteem which are sorely lacking. You are good enough as you are, you are not broken or second rate."
"This is heartbreaking. But you have to accept that you have no power here, and you have to accept that she IS going to do this, for whatever fucked-up reasons.

Tell her this:  

""I love you. I am worried for you. I have already said why I think this is a bad idea, and why (to me) this relationship looks like a recipe for disaster. BUT: You are 18, and **while I do not *agree* with your decision, I will *respect* it**. I will always be here for you. If you need any help, just ask. I swear on the grave of your mother that I will never say *'I told you so'*. I will not judge you.  I love you. So, what can I do to help right now? When do I get to meet him? I promise not to abuse him or hit him or anything; I'll be polite.""

Basically, you MUST keep lines of communication open. She needs to know you are there for her, if and when it all goes wrong."
"But you need to understand this is why Maria is responding as she is, and why -- if you cut her off abruptly -- she'll likely share this with her and your wife's mutual friends. Not out of spite, but out of love and concern. "
"She's probably embarrassed of what you'd think about her reading gay fanfiction. A lot of guys look down on it, or think it's weird because it's gay. Keep in mind those kinks may be solely reserved to fiction and not stuff she actually wants to do.

Did you really stumble across her browser history or were you snooping? "
"This is exactly how my parents are too. They never were interested in anything I did. They came to choir performances twice a year but other than that they couldn’t be bothered. They couldn’t even bother driving me to and from college that was 2 hours away. They always shipped me off on a train by myself. 

I moved 7 hours away and see them 1 time a year. Sometimes 2 if I’m feeling generous. I call maybe once a month and that’s about it. They show their love by sending care packages for major holidays but otherwise couldn’t tell you much about my life. They never ask, and I don’t bother telling them. Mostly because when I call home they only want to talk about their lives and if I try to tell them anything I’m generally steamrolled over and not listened to. It will most definitely strain their relationship. But if you stay involved and love them and show an interest, they’ll want to stay close with you and visit home when they grow older. You can’t change someone. But you can explain to him that he’ll never have a relationship with your children ever if he doesn’t try. 

I only regret moving so far because I’ve replaced them with my boyfriends family and they live even further away and we rarely see them. But definitely far more than my folks. My parents aren’t dumb. I’m sure they’ve done the math and figured out they’re closer to us than his parents and that we’ll spend 6 days with his parents for Christmas and maybe 4 hours with my folks. But they brought this on themselves. "

"Make sure this is the right call. If you cant figure out how to deal with eachother in high stress situations then maybe you are not right for eachother. Its better to find out now instead  of going back to dating for a few years before moving back in and realizing you cant make it work.

"I think you should give your friends the benefit of the doubt. I would be crushed if I knew one of my friends was projecting such cruel things on me.

"When someone defends this behaviour and demands women take it as a compliment, they might as well just come right out and admit they are the same creeps who do this shit.

It's repulsive and the people who do this are repulsive. "
Do you want to live the rest of your life like this? If I was you I would maybe try marital counseling and see if it got results or just bail. 
"+1 on this.

Yesterday my bf and I were joking around and it fit well within the conversation and our sense of humour to say ""well I guess I'll have to break up with you and go back to my ex then"". He said the same.

It was a topic we were both joking about and we were both laughing, but we also both felt it sting a little.

I can't imagine how cruel and hurtful it must be when you get that out if context."
"Second everyone saying it sounds like she is quite depressed and needs to see a doctor. Is she working at the moment? Going out with friends?

I would add that if she is depressed, then no matter how tactfully you bring up her weight gain or offer suggestions to improve her health, she's hearing 'you're fat and ugly'. That's just what depression does. I imagine that's why she's taking your comments so personally and crying when you bring this up \- you say 'let's go for a walk', she hears 'because you're fat and need to lose weight'. Additionally, if she is depressed, she's not being 'lazy' by staying in bed, it's just one of the symptoms of an illness. If she addresses the illness then it should also help with all the side effects of that illness, such as not doing anything, not having the energy to get out of bed and overeating.

That being said, you can't motivate her to change. You can certainly help her \- I know you've mentioned exercise, you could also cook healthy meals when it's your turn and support her emotionally in her efforts. But the decision to lose weight has to be her own. "

"Based on the post/comments, sounds like this dog was biting people (specifically the GF's family members) well before they moved in together. It was also already so anxiety-ridden that the GF was keeping it under constant medication.

Not to mention that this incident happened months after they moved in together, so the dog has had ample time to adjust to both the BF and his dog.

I agree that working with a trainer to build a serious, consistent training regime should be the first step. But at some point, if the dog doesn't show improvement and continues to be a danger to others (both people and dogs), putting it down isn't ""lazy"", it's the responsible thing to do - especially considering the dog's already poor QoL."

Pretty weird that he thinks going to soccer games is feminizing him. Seems like he's just an overall douche.
If he works in shifts and he’s any time between 3-7 days off in a row he has time to help around the house and take care of the kids. It’s really embarrassing on his part that the only thing he does is take out the trash while his wife works full time and does everything else.

It feels like a defence mechanism - you are too busy ascribing ""social dynamics and hierarchies"" to people to actually spend any time trying to **genuinely** get to know and understand them as individuals. I think you need to work on being more charitable with people's intentions, instead of assuming to quickly that they are ""dominant"" and ""controlling"", and trying to understand them and reach some level of mutual understanding."

"So it's time for you to pick up a new (and social) hobby. She looks up to and imitates you, so you can use that to introduce her to new things and people. Make sure you model how to make new friends. When I was a shy teen, I often just didn't know how to get started (making initial contact, chatting to find common interests, exchanging contact info, making plans to hang out). Maybe she's having similar issues.

There are many many many nerdy teen girls (and boys and nb people) at anime conventions, by the way. Protip: the easy way to talk with tons of people is cosplay. Do the nerdy things you two like have characters you could dress up as? People can spend a lot of money on cosplay but I've had fun in costumes I've bought in thrift shops or glued together the night before. Even wearing a t-shirt related to your hobbies will get some interesting conversations as long as you're friendly and don't smell bad. (I know I'm pushing this con thing hard, but they were hugely helpful to me back in the day, and still lots of fun when I get a chance to go.)"

It doesn’t have to be on this trip but if your gf is like me and doesn’t want a huge public proposal, I would do it in a more private and romantic setting, when there’s not a ton going on and it can be the two of you celebrating your future life together. "

"Well tough fucking shit, you're working full time and he doesn't have a job. Guess what that means? He's in charge of the house! He has responsibility to do all those things, and it's bullshit that he's putting it on you."
"Your ex is a shitty father and doesn't consider your son or his interests to be a priority. Your son is smart and intuitive enough to pick up on this and is responding accordingly. To say that it's important for him to spend time with his dad, when his dad doesn't care enough to make an effort to him is like saying, ""it's important that he stay hydrated, and since all we have in the house is bleach, he should drink that."" 

Spending time with a disinterested parent isn't good for him. It's making him feel like shit, and he's going to start resenting you for pushing this on him. If you want to play authority figure, why not tell your ex there's no visitation until he starts coming to his games?"
"The core issue is that he's said he'll do a thing, you've reminded him, discussed it, he's said he'll do it, *and he's still not doing it.* Whatever the ""it"" is, is almost irrelevant. He agreed, he's going back on his word - he's demonstrating to you that his word means fuck all. If he thinks it's ridiculous and doesn't want to do it, fine, but then it's on him to say that, not string you along by telling you what you want to hear while never having any intention of doing it.

All you can do is tell him that this matters to you, whether he thinks it's ridiculous or not. It will take no time, cost him nothing, he's said he'll do it, and he's not doing it. So you want to know when he'll do it. Agree a clear time he'll be sure to have ""got around to it"" by. Tell him you're sick of being strung along. Tell him the fact that he's laughing this off genuinely upsets you, and in a relationship he should give a shit about your feelings. Tell him it really bothers you that he's demonstrating a willingness to say whatever to get you off his back but then doesn't follow through, and that makes it hard to trust him.

Honestly it would make more sense if he was a deeply private person who didn't want to broadcast his status online - then you'd be on opposite sides and might be stuck. But he views it as ""nonsense""...allegedly. If its such an irrelevance to him, why is he making such a big deal about it?

Stop letting this go - get mad. Not because social media matters, but because his promises currently mean fuck all, and that's a real problem in a relationship. He needs to get it done or be honest with you about why he isn't. But telling you one thing and doing another is shitty behaviour. "

"You care about some random work people instead of your own wife? All you had to say was “Sorry but I’m married”. This would’ve sent the message to her that you are not available for obvious reasons.

Admit it, this whole thing highly intrigued you, and I’m sure with a little more prodding and persuasion from the coworker, you might actually find yourself cheating on your wife. "

I really feel loved via quality time, and it sounds like your partner may as well? We are also stay-home-and-Netflix people, but when I’m craving quality time I need like, conversation and laughter and connection, not just sitting together on the couch staring at a TV. It doesn’t have to be about deep dark secrets or anything - sometimes it’s just like, “What was the best thing that happened to you today? What was the worst?

I'd recommend getting whatever things you need and leaving that relationship. What she did is not even remotely okay. 
"This is an incredibly spot-on response on so many fronts.

OP has been playing with fire."
" &gt;Basically, the boundaries were would be not hanging out outside of work, including walking her across the bridge to her car

Those aren't ""boundaries"", they are rules of engagement that help someone defend his actual psychological/emotional boundaries when it comes to respecting his marriage.   Having to agree to rules is an acknowledgement that he has not established appropriate boundaries in his own mind.  Until that happens, they are just as prone to end up in an inappropriate ""friendship"".

They don't need to hang out outside of work to develop an intense ""friendship"" through personal discussions during breaks and meals together at work.  Strategies like the ones you propose don't get at the root of the problem, which is that your husband is too open to distractions from what is supposed to be his committed relationship with you.

Keep trying to see your couples counselor because this is an issue that needs attention now.

I’d recommend a spouse who won’t be mistaken as your father.

All this alcohol and lack of boundaries and telling him your marriage is rocky... Stop. You like it and you're encouraging it. Ew.
I definitely agree with you. I feel like OP's wife had at least some claim to innocence before but after making up that bullshit story she's more than likely guilty. If she honestly had no idea she wouldn't be making up random cover up stories.. Also you could get some sort of nanny cam and put it at the entrance to the bathroom and count your pills in the morning and night and just randomly and hopefully you can catch the guilty party.
I have that because in my family any disagreement was a huuuge deal. It was always my dad's way or the highway. That's obviously not true with normal people so I have to remind myself that I'm married to/working for/ in a project with/ fill-in-the-blank with a reasonable person.  But the emotion is still there.
"You've done most of what you can. What you are asking is completely reasonable, and having your partner be reasonably healthy is not a bizarre requirement for a relationship. Definitely post\-pone the wedding and any planning ASAP. There are two more steps I would take before you call it quits though. 

First, tell her that it's important to you that your life partner can take part in your hobbies. Be very upfront that you want to go on hikes and bike rides with her and schedule them. This is important for two reasons. First, maybe it will help her get active and healthy in a fun, not just going to the gym kind of way. And second, it takes the pressure off the weight and puts it onto the lifestyle. 

If she refuses to join you in these activities, you need to tell her that she needs to check into therapy because your relationship is at risk. Both in terms of compatibility (not able to have the same lifestyle you want) and because you are worried about her. It's likely that there is more going on here than weight\-gain, and hopefully addressing those concerns will help with the weight. 

If she refuses to help herself in any way, then you need to find a partner who will take care of themselves and hold the same values as you do. "
Correct.

"&gt;  she dial back their friendly interactions to nothing but cold professionalism and not except that to be awkward and to reflect poorly on her at work.

Where do you work that it's required that everyone be best friends? The way I interact with most of my coworkers is ""polite and professional"" and it reflects very well on my work. I only have a coworker or two that I would consider any sort of real friend and not just a work friend."
"&gt; How should she go about it when people have her blocked everywhere?

Has she even *mentioned* that she wishes she could make amends to them?

&gt; I wouldn't think it's right to contact someone who clearly wants no contact.

Then why are you trying to defend keeping her in your life, and by extension, your BF's life?

This is someone who treated your BF so badly that he's *still* hurt by it, and you're trying to find a way to dismiss or negate his pain in order to idolize them for being strong.

The natural consequences of doing something awful? Being a bit of pariah even *after* fixing your own flaws. Same as with addicts who hurt their families -- true remorse does not demand other people give out forgiveness on the offender's schedule.

&gt; It's something I have gone through myself, and it is one of the most difficult things to do in life, facing your flaws head on and correcting them.

It may be difficult. It's still much less difficult than taking the pains to not hurt them so badly in the first place, and it's less difficult than recognizing your flaws *and* making amends for them.

She's improved herself. *That is not a bad thing*. But that is *not* the same as making amends for what she's done, or fully accepting the consequences of them -- which, in this case, would be not getting to have enjoyable relationships with the loved ones of those she hurt. There's 7 billion other people in the world, she'll manage.

&gt; She chose not to date for over 4 years, wanting to get her own mental health in order during that time, rather than risking hurting anyone else.

Look, the very simple fact of it is -- you know exactly what at least *one* of her victims would need for closure, and for amends to be made. And you're trying to avoid having that happen. Is she aware of what your boyfriend has asked? Is she understanding of why he needs this and why she deserves it?

&gt; Honestly, yes, I admire her for the journey of facing the fact she had hurt people and making a change.

You can be happy about somebody for doing something good. That's different from admiring and looking up to them.

I'm happy when a politician does something right, even if I strongly dislike them. I don't need to admire or look up to them to recognize they did the right thing in a specific case."
[removed]
Do you think one of the reasons you look up to her is because it gives you hope that you can move on from your own past and mistakes? That’s okay and good. But I think you just need the figure out how serious you are about your bf. Trying to get him to forgive her or become friends with her doesn’t sound like a great idea to me. 
If he had acted like this from the start would you have been his friend? He is embarrassed &amp; also thinks he is entitled. Straight out of the r/niceguys handbook. Steer clear. 
" ""I tell him often that he is taking things the wrong way."" Yeah, that's going to help."
"When you do have your own place, please be careful about bringing men back to your place and introducing them to your kids. You don't want the kids growing up with a revolving door of mom's boyfriends, and you also don't want to expose them to anyone dangerous (like, get to know someone over the course of 6 months before you even think about introducing them to your kids).

It sucks that you can't date and have fun like a normal 22 year old, but that's the price you pay when you have children. "

"&gt; Whether or not it's accurate is inconsequential

He's gonna the feel the way he feels regardless, and it doesn't change much of anything.  But I'm telling you right now that he's gonna say you abandoned him.  Look at the pity party he's throwing himself and really consider how he is gong to frame this breakup.  Which speaks to why the breakup occurred in the first place, and why he shouldn't have bailed on therapy.  

But neither of those are - or should be - your problem.  In the business, they call that a ""blessing in disguise"""
"It doesn’t sound like a failure to communicate is the problem here.  It sounds like your mother intentionally says things that are critical or mean spirited, and you and your wife interpret those things correctly and respond with anger, which your mother interprets correctly.  The problem might be that there is too much communication - things would go more smoothly if you all start expressing less of what you’re thinking to each other. 

I think your first step is to figure out a realistic alternative plan for childcare.  Figure out a solution that you could switch to in the short term if you decide to.  You need to go into this conversation with your mother with everybody knowing that there are other options on the table. 

If there are a few specific topics that tend to be at the center of most of the disagreements, try to resolve them once and for all, and institute a ban on talking about those topics anymore. 

If you can rearrange schedules so that you pick the kids up instead of your wife, that would reduce tension a lot.  

But really, it sounds like your mother just can’t play a beneficial role in your day-to-day lives and the best way to resolve this will be to find another childcare solution.  "
"Talk to him about an allowance due to your career cut and pause for the bar exam. I don't think you should have full access to his finances. You are not married.

Also, I recommend having a prenup, separate bank accounts for each and one for combined expenses, with each contributing according to your income. You seem like a smaet woman. Stay financially independent. "
"&gt; If someone wanted to be called Lisa instead of Alex Im not going to fight them because it makes them feel more comfortable. 

This example doesn’t really have anything to do with the situation. Being asked to call someone by a preferred name or nickname is very different from being asked to refer to someone by Mr/Mrs Surname because they don’t want you to be on a first-name basis. "
"OP, this is poor advice. While I think your girlfriend could have communicated her frustration a bit better, your expectations here aren’t founded on anything reasonable, and her reaction is not indicative of any larger inability to compromise.

If you know your friend isn't ok with something why waste his time and jeopardize your friendship by not letting him know? I would be hurt if a friend set me up with someone that they knew didn't align with my relationship standards and didn't tell me. It's a lie of omission. If he was still interesting after hearing it he could pursue her but if not at least  you were upfront with your friend 
"1. Maybe he's not actually as ok with it as he pretended and he assumed it would eventually fall apart and you'd move on.
2. Maybe he's jealous that he hasn't found marriage, and here you are getting married first, and not only that, to the woman he dated first.
3. Maybe he always hoped he'd get back together with her and this is making a pretty concrete statement that he won't.
4. Maybe about a zillion other things.

Honestly, you're not going to get him to talk to you until he wants to.  And that doesn't sound like it will happen before the wedding.

I think your best bet is one last contact attempt saying you're here and willing to talk when he's ready.  Until then, you'll respect his space.  And that you love him and hope you'll hear from.  Then leave him alone.  More contact when someone has gone no contact will not improve the situation."
"One bad date is not the end of the world. You went out with the guy and he was an asshole \-\- this happens every day. 

Part of the point of being ""set up"" is to be exposed to people you might not have picked yourself and see what happens. You saw what happened and it sucked. You wasted a few hours of your life. No big deal. Just don't go out with anyone else that Mitch and Haley want to ""set you up with.""

I'm not really understanding why you feel the need to ""tell them off"" over this. "
"No, this is controlling behaviour

He is linking you showing skin to you looking for attention from other men, the better you look the more he will hate it.

"Counselling ASAP, man.  You need a neutral third party to weigh in.  

That said, it doesn't sound like your wife will be very open to criticism, but counselling is the last step before more drastic measures become necessary."
"He was divorced for three months when he met you. He was married for ten years. That's not a lot of time to process the end of his marriage.

I think you are very much underestimating what it means to be a step-parent. Your needs and your relationship with him will come second to those children, if he's a good dad. If he's a bad dad, then he is setting you up for failure as the much younger step wife to his two kids. They will view you as a symbol of their dad not loving them.

I would heavily advise you look at /r/stepparents and see what you're signing yourself on for. It's not all flowers and roses and you are very idealistic about your relationship with this man."
"&gt;It's her sister!

Good point -- OP's sister should treat OP much better since family is family. It's amazing that OP's sister would brush off her dog attacking her own family and then not offer to pay the medical bills!

I’ve been waiting for an apology, a response, or something for however long and I’ve gotten nothing. I can’t talk to you about your problems until we address this, and if you don’t want to then I guess good luck.” 

Especially if she’s never heard you mad before, she has no idea how seriously you view her being so forward and hysterical all the time. This is of course if you want to see if there’s a relationship worth saving, if not, fucking hit her back with “Lmao that’s rough sorry” and she’ll get the message or push you until you’re brutally honest with her.

"I totally understand watching porn, I watch it myself. But it really bothers me that it's girls we know.

"What's going on:  BF wants to date a side chick (and probably have sex with her, let's be real), and then wants to come back home to OP like nothing happened.

I can just see the family Christmas, 20 years from now:

""Oh, I remember when your dad proposed to me.  He'd just returned from an internship abroad.  After two weeks of dating and fucking Bethany, he came home to ask me to marry him and I said 'Yes!' because he _really loves me_."""
"I was in the exact same boat as you are. My parents are active in their church, volunteer, have cool hobbies, and are generally regarded as sweet, wholesome people. However, they were such terrible closet abusers, that I have Complex-PTSD from childhood abuse. 

My SO's parents are lovely. He has two sets, as each parent remarried, and they're all such loving and warm people - confirmed by my SO. 

I had to sit him down before he met my parents and explain; I basically said this: ""My parents are not good people. They would probably never outright breathe an unkind word to you, but they are not nice. They are openly racist (I'm white/Jewish, SO is Hispanic), classist, homophobic, and nasty, vile people (mainly my mother). My mom wrecked my credit because I didn't choose the major she wanted me to. They were abusive growing up. I am telling you all of this so that one day, if they're nasty to you, you can understand that it isn't your fault. I am civil with them now, but they have not and probably never will acknowledge their abuse towards me while I was growing up. I don't care if they don't like you. You will probably not like them once you pick up on how subtly incorrigible they are. We will see them as little as possible, and if they ever *do* decide to be brazen and insult you, I will 100% believe you, and will deal with it by telling them their relationship with me, and by extension you, is a privilege, not a right.""

"This is one of the most painful things I've ever read. This is an actual nightmare. I am so sorry you are going through this, OP. My heart goes out to you, too. I know you're incomprehensibly miserable right now, but *do* know that everything gets better with time and that there IS someone out there for you who will actually, genuinely respect you. I'm so sorry you were deceived by the length of time he spent with you. It's absolutely disgusting that he would throw this away for a girl he just met after being away from you for a few days. I mean, fucking hell. He is absolute garbage. I know six years is a lot of time to spend dodging a bullet, but at least you didn't marry this piece of shit.

Do not take him back. This is, like...emotional abuse. He doesn't even deserve to be in the same room with you anymore. You can't trust someone who throws you off a cliff like this after being away from you for five minutes. He doesn't deserve you. He clearly doesn't respect you.

Most importantly, don't think this at all has anything to do with you. His ability to so quickly turn on you has nothing to do with you as a person. He's clearly, like, prepubescent in the head. It's like he lost his mind just because he left the country.

Even the ones who didn't seem particularly friendly to one another. "
I'm not sure her cooking really is weird.
Why is she even asking to borrow money if she owns a successful business and three properties?
"She's on the app to see if she can do better. She doesn't want to be alone, kinda person who.goes from one relationship to the next"
"&gt; And so is jaywalking, waking up a sleeping bear to take a photo, keeping an ice cream cone in your back pocket on Sundays, ordering pizza to one's house without his consent, and much more.
&gt; Does that mean you can't resolve it peacefully ?

*One of these things is not like the other*. I notice you don’t include examples like grievous bodily harm, death threats or anything that this sexual assault is actually on par with. You can resolve *your* examples ‘peacefully’ because it doesn’t involve hurting someone else, traumatising them and then going on to do the same thing to other women. If she doesn’t involve the authorities, this guy will continue his predatory ways unchecked. What the fuck is wrong with you?

"Oh, I'm a POS because no cheating asshole is gonna leave me for a mutual friend and still live in my place? K. "
"Well turn it around on him. How well does he know all of your likes and dislikes.  Apparently not well enough to not be an asshole about this. 

Think about it. "
"Yeah he’s now saying he’s depressed and I don’t think he gets it because he thinks that I can stop it in demand like I was inflicting my moods on him out of choice.

I think I’ll rearrange the flat, hopefully it’ll make it feel more like mine."
"True, but in OP's case, this happened twice. She confronted him after the hugging picture fiasco, then he deliberately uploaded additional pictures of dinner after. It's either he doesn't give a shit about her or he's doing it intentionally, both of which are rude and not something you do to someone you claim you love. "
"True. Maybe the advice should have been name the kid what OP wants and cut contact with the grandmother completely. If the grandmother thinks having a hand in the name gives her rights over the child maybe sacrifice the name. If she's the kind to go wailing over ""myyy baaaaby!"" it might be wisest not to give her more ammunition."
"I wish I could send a ""YAAASSSS"" gif but stand by this comment so much. I've seen way too many friends take back exes over and over again and they wonder why they struggle with life"
"We get it, she's leggy and beautiful. She's also a nasty human being. Would you eat a delicious looking cupcake if you knew the center was shit?"
No no no no do not contact him this is a terrible idea 
"This is great advice, further I'd add don't treat her with kid gloves like she's fragile and you might break her. Don't ignore problems because you think because she has issues it's an excuse. Communicate and ask her questions about how you can support her, how she would like you to react etc when issues come up. Be willing to learn from and with her, don't assume she can't handle/can't pay/can't do better."
"It's not a mistake, though. When someone treats you like garbage, they've made the decision to do it. He hurts you on purpose, because he wants to.

As someone married and with the same person for 17 years, heed this advice: it is never okay to hurt your partner. Not even when one of you is mad. Love is respect. The person you choose to be with is someone who should love and respect you above all else. That means that even in times of anger and disagreement, THAT RESPECT COMES FIRST. 

My husband has never even yelled at me, let alone raised a hand towards me. And I can say the same. Yeah, we get mad sometimes. Yeah, we disagree. But the love and respect comes first. You have the right to demand respect at all times. 

When someone treats you this way; yells at you, insults you, physically hurts you--it's not a mistake. The sole purpose of these actions is to intimidate you into compliance. There is no love or respect in that. At all. Ever.

Also, it will get worse. He thinks it's okay to treat you this way. It's not a mistake. He hurts you on purpose, because he wants to. No amount of love bombing and inside jokes changes that. This is a person who is ready and willing to hurt you, because he wants to.

Is that what you think love looks like?

No matter what you do, always demand respect. And if someone refuses to treat you with respect, they are not worthy of your companionship. 

After all... would you tell anyone else to stay in a relationship with someone who hurts them on purpose? Doesn't that sound nuts, if you say to someone, ""He only hurts you on purpose because he wants to *sometimes,* you should totally stay with him"" ? Don't you think...that nobody deserves to be treated that way?

Edit to add: don't move in with this guy. Never escalate a relationship to fix it. You escalate a relationship when things are great, not when things are only good some of the time. 

""Things will be better when we move in...""

""Things will be better when we're married...""

""Things will be better when the baby gets here...""

No. Just no. You don't fix a shit relationship--and you've described a shitty relationship--by removing your options and letting him trap you. You'd better believe that when he thinks he's got you stuck that one shove is going to turn into a punch in the face. The acceptable amount of abuse in a relationship, if you're very concerned about percentages, is ZERO. Good relationships are ZERO percent abusive."
"The only thing you really need to do right now is take care of yourself. Your dad put his own feelings of excitement above your wishes, which is a shitty thing to do. You have every right to feel hurt.
But I wouldn't spend too much energy on your family right now. If you feel like your sister could provide you with support and help, then give her a call. But if you feel like you two want to deal with your pain alone for now, you should do that. You don't owe them anything.

Having your husband talk to your sisters and father might be a good idea if he agrees. But make sure you both let yourself heal first. When things calm down a bit, you'll be able to think more clearly and deal with your parents properly. Until then, be good to yourself.

Good luck"
He tried to give your kid to an 18 year old to raise. Lady. Love yourself a little.
"I was actually thinking this same exact thing, I’m glad you said something as I don’t feel like I’m crazy now for thinking this. She used to work with infants even. "
"This is good\-\-so is just a plain ""no thanks!"" Or a more direct ""nah\-\-school buddies is the right level of friendship for me right now."" Saying no is a useful life skill.

I also suggest asking yourself: if you never hung out with this girl again, would you miss her? Or would it be a relief? That can help you define whether you actually want to be friends, or if she's just a tolerable\-verging\-on\-annoying\-or\-anxiety\-inducing presence in your life."
Then it sounds like you two are just incompatible and I don't see you two working out.
"How close do you want your family to be in the future? Living in the same house or the same neighborhood? Seeing them every day?

It is completely reasonable for somebody to want to see their in-laws less frequently than that. But you're not getting into any specifics, so it's hard to tell."
"Have you made it clear to your wife that you expect see your family once a month or so or is it possible she's afraid of having them around much more often than that?

Once a month is doable, IMO, as long as they are nice to her and treat her very well."
"I'm in agreement with you. What I was pointing out is that with the current split he doesn't have three times more, he likely has much more than that. On a proportional split the partner who makes more money will always have that percentage more ""fun money"" and will also be paying that percentage more in household bills.

On a 50/50 bill split the partner who makes more is on a practical level being subsided by the partner who is making less."
"No, she was pretty much punched in the face with conclusions. Theyre totally hooking up, this is obvious. Side note, I don't think I've seen so many people all in agreement in my 10 years lurking this site. I'm getting a lil misty eyed here."
"I take back what I said, run, don't walk"
For now do yourself a favor and prepare for the worst. Keep text messages and things like that which could prove useful. 
"Either forgo whatever you were about to buy by saying “ah okay guess we’ll pass on this today”
Or say “okay you got the next one!” 

"
"you're probably right :) in that example, he just had some personal household chores to do (we don't live together, for example) but he does do a lot to make up for it in other ways. I mentioned in a few other comments he plans budget\-friendly dates often, and he'll do small acts of love like clean up my apartment when I run to the grocery store/pick up the takeout. 

Do you think that's something we should actually formally acknowledge? I feel awkward saying it out loud, if this is in fact his informal way of meeting the gap."
"Lol, we need to meet halfway on how often I insult you"
"I think you should definitely say it out loud, just to prevent it from going unsaid or as a source of negative energy in the future "
