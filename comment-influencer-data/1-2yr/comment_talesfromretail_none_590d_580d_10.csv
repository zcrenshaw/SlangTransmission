Sounds like the kind of woman who would still be pissed off even he did spend $100.
"Listen you, I didn't come here for *warm and fuzzies*

I came here for *cynicism and hate*

But it is a very nice story, thank you :)"
"My two cents on this story is that she got just what she deserved. I have no doubt in my mind that if you'd let her go with the gas, you'd never have seen the $1 from her, and she'd probably dispute any billing. If she'd just tried to pay with 100 pennies, that would be one thing, but vindictively dropping them all over the floor like that? Heck no. She can go elsewhere for gas, because that's a level of petty decent people shouldn't have to deal with. "
"‘Only afford potato soup for dinner.” Wow guys, look at this big roller over here, she gets to eat SOUP."
"You: ""But since you're familiar with the managers, you must also be aware that I am not a manager. ID please?"""
"I once had a customer refuse to show me ID for a beer purchase.  (Company policy: card everybody.  Yes it sucked.)

He starts slamming his fist down on the counter yelling about how I'm wrong, I'm profiling him because we didn't have the same complexion, I'm violating his rights....

Then the greatest thing happened.  A police officer walked up and got in line behind him.  The police officer heard some of his vague threats and then did the most amazing thing.  The police officer asked him to see his ID.  

I about DIED!!!"
"I was waiting for this customer to be a lot less reasonable. Like they blamed your tv for breaking the XBox or they expected you to fix the XBox because they bought the tv from you, something like that."
"I love how you could actually say no in that situation. Used to work for another rather large grocery store on the east coast and we would have had to do the refund. No questions asked.  Just before I left they pushed a policy where even if there was no item and no receipt, give them a refund if its under $100. "
MINIMUM $100! NEXT!!
"I love that they always say they'll never come back

I'd only reply ""awesome, thanks!"""
This door says exit. Do I go out this one or the other?
Agreed. I held my hands out to receive the pennies nicely and everything. The smirk killed me LOL I was boiling
Wow. And a lot of mothers would probably appreciate it even if it did only cost $25. 
He seriously called CS while still in your store? LOL
"Oh my gosh, that’s so satisfying!"
And now she's been arrested and banned from the closest gas station to her house over a dollar. I hope the next one is miles away.
This is cold hearted but I really don't care about your life story. Either buy the crap or get out.
"Absolutely. I grew up in a family where thriftiness was next to godliness, and if I’d spent $100 on my mom for Mother’s Day, she’d have had a heart attack. The secret was to spend $25 in such a clever way that it looked like $100. This last Christmas, my husband got my mom a le creuset  Dutch oven at a ridiculously good price. Part of what made the present special to my mom was telling her we got it at 60% off with an added 20% off coupon. She prides herself on rarely paying full price for anything."
"Wow....but if a customer touches us there's not a damn thing we can do about it apparently.  Well,  I bet you could but that puts you at risk for getting fired,  I think...eh, stores can be very unfair to their employees."
How does he think he's gonna return it if he didn't bring it with him?  That's literally what that means
The sad part is that if you work for a retail chain they will just take it to another store to try and get their money back. I worked for a store one time and we had a customer quite similar to this so we ended up calling around other stores to let them know about the fraudulent return that was headed their way.  People will do whatever they can to cheat the system.  
"I always loved the ""are you new here?!"" question followed up with how they are such a veteran shopper of the place.

You wouldn't be asking if I was new here if you knew so god damn much about the store.... but just retail smile and nod."
"Did you thank her for not coming back? 

It's pretty rare for a customer to offer to improve your working conditions like that. "
"I hope you called local PD and not only reported them, but put it on record that they were informed of the law and still refused to comply "
"What in the hell kind of policy is that, I would hate that so much lol. Damn... And I thought WE were lenient with refunds"
"I had a similar situation to this when I worked in the deli. I was cleaning our cheese slicer, and some guy walked up for cheese when I was spraying it down with sanitizer, the final step in our 3 part cleaning process. He wanted some cheese and when I went to put it on the slicer he said ""don't cut it on that, I don't want it touching those chemicals you just used."" 
 
So I tried explaining it was a food grade, non toxic  sanitizer that evaporates within 20 seconds and that wasn't good enough for him. I told him I couldn't cut cheese on any other slicer without cleaning first because it would violate our policy and health codes and he ended up leaving with no cheese. "
That employee seems very honest.
"&gt; but when I returned to work the next morning I'm informed that he called the store calling me out by name, saying he was going to come back and strangle me.

And that's when you call the police the next time he steps foot in the store again. Yikes."
"Customer: *I'm never ever coming back here!*

Every retail worker, ever: *k :D*"
"Idiot should've checked the phone thoroughly on his own, dried it out, and then returned it, if it truly still turned on.  Serves him right."
"&gt;I walk around the counter to show him how much of a dumbass he is, hold the watch up, and push in the crown. The watch starts ticking.

FTFY"
"&gt;X1X ID10T ERROR

I'm dead.  Also, that's what Customer gets for shopping with -Competitor- anyway!  At least Customer was cool about the whole thing :)"
No- you call the police now.  You have his information from the return- he’s literally made a death threat. He needs to be arrested.  What a disgusting excuse of a human.
I think he has been progressively acting worse in hopes the bigger the scene the better the discount 
"While us poor slobs are over here eating spam and saltines and she gets soup. 

So jealous. "
"IM SORRY, DID YOU JUST TELL ME TO LEAVE MY ALLERGIES OUTSIDE?!

"
"*walks into meat department* 

WHY DID NO ONE SAY THIS WASN'T AN EXIT"
"I manage a store, and I just had someone call one of my staff a bitch for a ridiculous reason as well. I told the customer to get out immediately and to come back when (s)he can behave like a proper adult with manners. Don't care what my home office would say, you don't talk to people like that because you're unhappy with whatever. Any company that doesn't stand behind their people being treated like people doesn't deserve their employees or anyone buying from them. "
"awww

Rest easy, Liam. If there is an afterlife consciousness, I  hope there's sparkling clean coolers full of bright festive fizzy pop and one water."
I freaking love that she thought she was going to “show you” with her immature antics and “get even” with you because you had the nerve to make her pay for something and not only did it backfire but it backfired big time!!! Love it!!!
"Hi, bartender and server here. Tables do this all the time. "
"&gt; I didn't come here for warm and fuzzies

&gt; I came here for cynicism and hate

I feel like if there was an archway into the internet this is what it would say. "
"LMAO I transferred to days last year after 5 years on the night shift.  I got this all the time ""Are you new??"" 

""No, I've been with this store for 6 years""

""Well you don't seem very familiar with your policies!"" 

No ma'am, it is you, in fact, who are not familiar with our policies.  And the answer is still no, we won't return your empty box.   We do need the actual item in order to process a refund.   "
"I love the ""this year you're worth $25"" line. Ahahaha ha! Vain bitch. Can't she just be grateful? "
"I laughed a little when he said he wanted the best pair of bolt cutters and then immediately said they didn't need to be perfect, just cheap. That's a conversion I've had too many times. 

Then I laughed harder at the end. Any idea what they were trying to keep him out of?"
"I had a lady pull the race card over the phone yesterday. She claimed that because she was black we shut her phone off. I put a stop to that real quick by telling her we're not the ones who even shut off the account. We have a system that does it. Plus, you can't program discrimination into a program (I think)

Edit: It is possible"
"Eh I did have one of the AP guys watching the car and she was in it as she was screaming at me so I didn’t follow up but yeah lol as soon as I got off the phone, I asked if anyone had eyes on her and was about to call.  

Once the police have been notified, they can give us permission to break a window to release the animal so that really would have ruined her day."
"you had spam and saltines? consider yourself lucky, pal. when i was growing up, all we had to eat was dirt. raw dirt."
"Good thing he didn’t hit anyone, or he would’ve been charged for battery"
On what planet is reasonable to expect a custom cake in 30 minutes?
