I love your manager... This is one of the best ways to fire an unwanted costumer that I have ever seen!
"I love that you called it a fruit stand. So vague, and yet somehow incredibly specific"
 Maybe we should have a weekly positive stories thread. 
It’s early here and saw the fruit stand and price first. I was wondering how fruit could possibly be that expensive lol. Then I read the phone part and it made sense.
"I'd say my minimum for taking a pistol round to the chest with a plate carrier I knew was brand new would be around $50,000. "
"I used to work for a business owned by a family with the last name ""Robert"". People would come in all the time claiming that they knew ""Robert"". They backed down pretty quick when I asked them which one they were referring to, as there were four siblings who ran the business. "
Can you please cross post this to malicious compliance? This is amazing. 
What an awesome reaction from the Dad! 
Dude your manager rocks! I wish my managers had the metaphysical balls yours had. Also I feel terrible for that kid. I can only imagine what it must be like being raised by that psychopath. Hopefully their father offset the crazy. 
"A 9"" pie is supposed to serve 8 to 10 people? No wonder I'm a fatass."
"I used to work in a grocery store directly next to a major University sports complex (multiple outdoor feilds, and an indoor football feild for the college team). People would *always* park in our lot and then walk over to the stadium for football games. Finally the manager hired a parking company to ticket cars that had been parked longer than 60 minutes. One guy parked in a Handicapped only spot, without a handicapped pass on his car, and take off for the game with a group full of people. Not only did the parking company give him a for every hour he was parked there, but they called the local police to report it as well. The police came and ticketed the car too."
"&gt; Me: Could you please not open that? You could get ink all over.
OM: I would rather you didn't talk to my son.
Me: I was just trying to warn him to be careful about the ink in the machine.
OM: Yeah I just don't want you talking to my kid. 

You:  OK.  (Looks directly at SM)  Please tell your child to stop playing with the coupon printer, it is not a toy.  Now please."
"My manager took care of that. They came back the next day to return the tuxes. Pretty sure the guy who stole the tux got one of the other groomsmen to return it for him. From what I heard, the groom was *not* happy."
I work in a cell phone store and there is a big uptick in fraud.  Lots of identity theft.  People are starting to steal tax IDs from businesses too.  Had become worse since the breach at the credit bureau
"&gt;Here, I'll give you $200 if you put on this vest that was designed to stop handgun rounds and knives and let me shoot you with a much-higher-power rifle round from an indeterminate distance

Yeah nah, fuck outta here."
Huh. I really can’t grasp what people are thinking about sometimes. 
I hope you told the groom why he had to pay as well as who stole the tux.
Would be awesome if someone had filmed her getting kicked out by the police and posted that.  Safe to assume she would freak out over it.
Gotta love those parents that encourage bad behavior by putting their precious spawn on a pedestal. If they keep that up the kids gonna have no respect for non-parental authority. 
I thought tales from retail could only be bad. This was a very pleasant story! Thank you for sharing :)
"Yeah I had the same thing regularly. ""I know the Farmer's"" ""well Farmer is his first name..."""
"""I'M NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!""

""Can I get that in writing?"""
"Ok, credit card an driver's license please? Ok, thanks it will be a little while before the police get here."
"You’d think maybe she’d worry about the weight of the plastic baggy holding the tomatoes, or maybe even the vines that you throw away, but no, of all things, she’s worried about the air in the bag. "
"People like this who think they can just make comments like these drive me insane. 


Honestly, if you don't know me personally, keep your damn mouth shut with those smart ass comments. Why do customers insist on flexing some sort of authority and making you uncomfortable?! Buy your stuff and bugger off. "
"If it was stripping, they would be $1s.  Knocking over an ATM would be $20s.  I'm not sure how one gets a backpack full of $5s."
"the classic ""don't have enough but magically more money appears"" ruse.

I hate people like that-they say they don't have enough yet by the end of the transaction, they clearly had enough the whole time"
"I used to do this as a lifeguard at a water park frequently. 

&gt;Me to struggling small children: ""Hey, move back toward shallower water please :)""

&gt;Parent: ""My kid do what they want when we paid $$$$""


&gt;Me to parent: ""Kk, you get your child before I do."""
Like a Sanity Sunday? Manners Monday? Warm-hearted Wednesday?
&gt; I'm free! Where should I go? Treat store!
"Yeah i have a posse of steampunk cosplayers hanging around my yard, harassing the neighbors. I'll definitely try this! Not sure how to get them on the scales though..."
"If one of my groomsmen or bridesmaids did that to me at my wedding, I don't think our friendship would last much longer. I mean, that's an awful thing to do when the groom is already covering a good deal of costs for the wedding, not to mention that if the tux was damaged or not returned he'd be liable. Although, you could have called the police on the thief, because tuxes are expensive! And you had his name and everything, and the associated wedding party! How the heck did he think he'd get away with this?!"
This must be what an erection feels like.
Yeah that sounds about right! :p
"Talking back to a lifeguard? Do they not know why you're there, for fucks sake?"
Bitch doesn’t deserve any friends. 
I dunno if that's intentional fraud - she sounds very very naive
"&gt; OK. Don't grab peoples kids.

Comments like that make my opinion of management drop like a fucking rock. You got cameras, what was claimed to have happened is absolutely ridiculous. Just like... fuck off and learn to manage people."
Man how I wish she would have been a super stubborn customer and bought all 120 yards
I bet the price match would've amounted to a few bucks.  She was willing to get dragged off by the cops over that.
"Is this real?

&gt;  OM: Well fucken override it, bitch.

Why did the conversation get past this point?"
"So the pie is 8"" on the bottom, and 10"" at the top.  I am going to assume the average pie is about 2"" tall.  Plugging that into the equation for a partial cone, you get about 128 in^3.

128 in^3 equals about .55 gallon, or about 2.2 quarts of pie, or 2 liters.

""How big is your pie?""

""2 quarts!""

"
"We got a pic of her face from a screenshot on the cameras, and put a note that this woman is bold, like not your typical shifty sneaky theif, so watch out haha"
Just thought I'd say that your Store Manager is the man. Handled it beautifully.
"I was in a busy Italian bakery one day waiting to get a lunch sandwich.  This place is always busy and since people like to wander shopping or looking in the display cases, you have to take a number from the ticket dispenser.  I was waiting my turn but I noticed a little white haired old lady who had been patiently waiting, she thought she was in line and didn't realize there is no line and you need a ticket to be served.  She had been there waiting before I even got to the store and now there were still 7-8 people ahead of her.  I felt bad for her since it's a common mistake if you're new to this bakery and it wasn't fair that she had to wait so I offered to trade her ticket for mine putting me last.  She was very appreciative and got served next.  I didn't think much of it, I only thought it was fair but another lady in line couldn't help but comment how nice I was to her and the baker overhead and he gave me a nice pastry for free to go along with my lunch.  So just doing something nice things for strangers doesn't always get you ahead, but the warm feelings I felt was really the best reward that day."
So she essentially was just feeding her children at the grocery store? I guess that's one way to do it.
"Ah, in IT we call this type of interaction a 'Unicorn'"
I feel so much for you with this. I work in the EXACT same type of position as you.
"Had fun with that at one job. Bosses name was Robin and he was a man. As soon as someone said they knew Robin and wanted to speak to HER I'd casually reply 'Sorry, HE is rather busy at the moment. Can I take a name and number for HIM to contact you on when HE'S free?' 

They usually apologised and left, gave their order or if on the phone go silent before hanging up. 

To note I knew my bosses family members so anyone trying to pull that would get stared at and called out. My boss was great like that."
"&gt; Him: Yeah, well how quick can they get here?

Oh, you misunderstand, it was for them to stop *me* beating *you* to death..."
"Yeah, but if you hadn't said anything, the brat would have gotten ink on himself and the dad would have blamed you... 

Gotta love how they set up the next generation to treat retail workers like garbage. "
"I can't believe she thought that would work. No store on earth will let you take 80 dollars worth of items with a promise to ""pay the next day"". It's amazing how these people manage to survive to old age."
I worked at a tool store and someone made a $300 purchase and paid entirely in fives that smelled um grassy? herby?
"Funniest one I read was a woman working at the front desk of a business when a guy comes in and tries to get past her saying he's the owners son.

She turns her had and yells out, ""HEY DAD!  DO I HAVE A BROTHER YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME ABOUT?"""
"I was tempted to call the police, but my manager said to wait until the next day when they returned the tuxes to see if he could make it work out. If they had refused to pay for the tux he probably would have called the police on the guy who stole it. I feel bad for the groom."
"I’ve heard plenty of people defend obnoxious behavior by saying, “it’s the principle that matters.”

I️ got a 15 minute tirade about “principals” from a guy I️ shortchanged by five cents. The only “principle “ I️ learned from that experience was that guys principles were worth about 20 cents an hour. "
"This is the kind of customer...the willfully or helplessly ignorant...who needs to be kept out of stores. It wouldn't matter if you went line item by line item down a receipt, showed them tape of their bad behavior, had witnesses, sued them in civil court and won, or what have you. They can't understand what they've done that anyone would find objectionable."
"It's true that when a lot of older people become sedentary and homebound, they start to decline. Basically anything that keeps you physically and mentally active: work, hobbies, babysitting grandchildren, will help prolong your life. Even if your retirement funds don't need you to work, it's good to get out of the house and have human interaction and stuff too. "
"Oh my word, what brilliant new sub have you introduced me to? Lol"
"The price for the ticket (which is set by my company, not the grocery store) is printed on the ticket with a picture of the license plate on it. The picture is taken and the ticket is printed out all on this little machine the attendant carries around. Then (if it goes to collections) they use the License plate # to notify credit agencies, and it goes to the owner of the car."
"""This is a public place!""

You keep using that word, public. I don't think it means what you think it means."
I don’t think it was. But her naïveté definitely shocked me. 
"I can understand this situation, though. That lady could have told him to register for the son, and nothing he said would change her mind. 

It's kind of like a person will refuse an answer is correct until they talk to the manager, even if the manager says the exact same thing. "
"I also work at a fruit stand and the things I’ve experienced there is unlike any other... 

I once had someone try to pay me in singles and quarters to replace their damaged device after it got ran over.. all $299 of it in singles and some change. I learned after joking about all the singles that it was her laundry money and the rest of her income for the next month... I immediately partnered with my manager to make it at no cost, I’ve never had someone start to cry and get up and hug me."
I *hate* that! I *hate it* when managers don't have your back! How the fuck are you supposed to respect them if they throw you under the bus? Sorry this happened to you. I'm furious for you.
"&gt; vines that you throw away

I've heard that if you are roasting the tomatoes keep them on the vine. That the vine contributes a large amount of aroma and some flavor to the final product."
"At first, I thought the customer's reply was talking about how he ""cut in line."" :("
"Possibly not even designed for knives. Kevlar provides excellent cut protection, but by itself very poor stab protection."
Omg. Imma bout to kill a bitch. These kinda people should not be living.
"I just recounted what happened, Im not trying to imply anything."
"Nice. So when the company issues a ticket, how do they get the fine?"
"Here I was thinking ""Who the hell pays 1k for fruit??? "
3 for now and 3 for later 
"I love customers who think that you are somehow obstructing them.  As if the company comes by later and pats you on the back and whispers ""Here is your half of the cut.  Good work."""
Update us if she comes back
"Not gonna say which store bc it's the same as the one you work at... 

I noticed too sketchy ladies in the parking lot on my way in. They made it into the store before me and before I can reach the doors, they're bolting out of them holding at least 10 pairs of sweatpants each. 

I'm assuming those sweats cost at least $70 at your store

I called the police cuz I got a plate number as I ran after them. Filed a report with the store as well. 

The manager told me the ladies had been hitting up every single High End Lingerie Store in outdoor malls. They even robbed one of the stores 2x in one day!!

Y'all don't get paid enough for that "
