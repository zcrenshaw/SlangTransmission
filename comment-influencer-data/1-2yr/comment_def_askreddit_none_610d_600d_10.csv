Go home, sleep a few hours, go to my third shift job from 11pm-4am
TTh I would have school from 1-4, go straight to my serving job 5-10, then from there go straight to my third shift job 11-4am. Repeat. 

15 credit hours with class m-f, 25 hrs m-f third shift, then serving Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Sunday’s I was off from everything and used that as a sleep/homework catchup day
