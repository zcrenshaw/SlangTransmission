It's probably not worth the risk to confront someone who is already showing antisocial behavior.
"Here's the dealio. People playing their phones in this way know they are rude, they know they are annoying other people, and they just don't give a fuck. Its not a misunderstanding. You can ask them to turn it down, and you can expect the response to be ""fuck you.""
"
"Yes, perhaps your stern rebuke will reform their entire character and you'll be the talk of the 6 train, or perhaps you will get assaulted by an antisoical dickbag that was itching for a throwdown. Seems like a worthy gamble. "
Have him pay for the whole thing and Venmo him your fair share. 
Infuriating.
Pretty much this. Standard operating procedure for dealing with people exhibiting antisocial behavior in New York is to ignore them to the extent your well being is not threatened. Ignoring minimizes their nuisance because confrontation can trigger them to escalate. That's my experience at least.
"Who knows what he's thinking. But if he's this annoying now, imagine what it will be like when your fridge breaks and you want him to fix it? I would go elsewhere. "
"My s/o and I usually split 50/50, but we usually keep pace in food and drinks, your s/o kinda sounds like a dick."
"If you wear a safety vest and hard hat, nobody will question why you are painting one of the green benches red."
"Letters and numbers for routes. 

Uptown/downtown/outer borough for direction."
"It is the fucking worst, it's a bunch of drunk fucks who head into the city at 10am dressed as santas and get wasted, then proceed to make everyone around them miserable while they drunkenly get into fights, vomit on the street, act like general assholes and probably ransack a bar that doesn't serve them, etc. They are the worst kind of bros. There is nothing redeeming about it. It is not a parade, it is not a con, it is a shitty bar crawl."
"No, for a city like this, layering is your best option. "
"&gt;but it seems like he thinks drinking is a really essential part of eating out.

I mean if he truly feels this way then he should be more than willing to always pay for his drinks.  There is nothing stingy about not wanting to pay for drinks when you didn't get a drink. There is nothing stingy about not wanting to pay half of a $20 entree when yours was $10. There is something wrong with your bf....and if this is how he is treating the financials now then I don't think it will get better in the future."
No. I’m mildly convinced that most (if not all) of the people that do this are *looking* for a confrontation. Ignoring them is the best route to take. 
"I get it and you're absolutely right, but this person is clearly a dick so don't expect them to apologize and turn the music off. 

If I were you I wouldn't. But I'm a pussy sooo..."
"I wouldn't say gay-friendly, but NYers aren't really anything-friendly. Nobody cares about you being gay, or straight, or who gives a fuck. As long as you don't block the sidewalk while doing your gay bullshit, straight bullshit, or who gives a fuck bullshit, you'll be fine. And don't talk to me if I've got headphones in. "
"If you run fast enough, criminals won't be able to catch up to you."
"Some buildings have a list where people can write down if they will be giving out candy, or you can put something on your door to let them know you are welcoming trick or treaters. Your neighbors will generally not show up to your door unless there is an indication that you are participating.

In the city, kids go trick or treating at stores. Many places give out candy and food places will often give them a free treat."
"ABQ NYC was a sick breaking bad themed popup in Brooklyn this summer. You make your own drinks in the meth trailer with dry ice and stuff. I think it's closing soon, but the waiting list will be super short if it's still open and coordinates with your friend's trip.  House of Yes is another Brooklyn option. Go on a costume mandatory night and don't tell them ANYTHING about the bar, even the name. Let them go to the costume trailer and get a bunch of cool jewelry/wig/body paint/ etc. super cheap. Get tickets ahead of time so you can skip the line and pay less cover. Then after enough drinks and party favors if that's your thing, get them in the line for the naked hot tub. Again- tell them nothing. My friends did this my first time and it was the weirdest, wildest evening. Definitely what I think of when people say ""this is soooo Bushwick I can't even"". After we went to some rave that didn't start until 5:30 am they found on resident advisor. 

If you're into classier stuff, speakeasies are always a good bet. Raines at the William had DIY old fashioneds but it isn't as hidden as like Back Room or Bathtub Gin.  There's also a speakeasy restaurant called the bohemian somewhere in the West Village. You can only get in by getting the phone number from someone who has already been. I have not, but I hear it's incredible and sounds very ""L.A."" To me. I also enjoy taking bougie friends to the boom boom room and saying ""you guys know when Solange went apeshit on Jay Z in that elevator? Yeah this was that elevator"". I believe it's technically the one on the right side but either works.  If you're a group of cute girls it's also amusing to go to the Rose Bar (at the plaza, not the trendy Gramercy club. Though that place is sick too, just hard to get in without a hotel room) on a weekday night, dressed all fabulous and let 80 year old investment bankers try to hit on you. Some of them wear really funny suits and use terrible lines. 

If you want to go more trashy, Iron Horse is a dive bar in the Fidi. Slip the bartender a $20 and they'll throw your friend on the swing on the bar and give him/her a sort of lap dance acrobatic routine. Also down there you can take the Staten Island ferry at night. Bring booze and food, the ferry is free.    Way cooler picnic than Central Park. Also outdoorsy (if it isn't freezing- we've been lucky with weather) is kayaking off the pier on the west side somewhere near Hudson Yards and the Chelsea Trapeze school. It's literally trapeze classes on the river. Carrie Bradshaw did it on SATC, so if they're show fans they might remember it. 

For the more educated type, we have museums. I don't think L.A. Really does. Museum of sex, museum of moving image, tenement museum, mmuseumm (museum of random shit), and the museum of the American gangster are all weird ones. On that note, less extreme but I love the Chelsea galleries. Most open Thursday and there's some awesome ones. There's also really weird ones. Both are fun. 

As far as tours- I liked the NBC studio tour when I was 10. Better than waiting to try and be on the today show and was actually super informative. It's incredibly touristy though. There's also slightly less touristy food tours. It's like $50 a person and they stop at 6-8 spots in a certain neighborhood with a snack and drink at each. My favorite is the Bowery/Nolita one- it's actually how I discovered two of my go to date night restaurants. You could also do a ""world food tour"" on your own, but this would take significant planning on your part. Take the train all over the 5 boros to the real ethnic neighborhoods and pick a spot in some of the more obscure ones with food they've never tried. Like start in little Somalia and work to a Russian supper club in Brighton beach (those can be lit too, really strange but fun). 

In conclusion, many of the things in the abstract of my dissertation are not answering your question at all. However, I took my adderall and am procrastinating, so I brain dumped every semi cool thing I could think of here. It's personally selfish and for my own reference in the future. But good luck! I'm sure others are way trendier than I am and I'll be stalking this thread for things to do. 

OH!- also go to Union Square and dance with the guy chanting free love. He gives you signs to hold and hugs and is in a generally good mood compared to most jaded street people. He's not homeless I don't think, just reeeeeally happy. "
"I've got you covered.  New York’s hottest club is: Wesh

Description: Nine-year-old Tokyo pimp Ichiaku Guru is back with an all new hotspot that answers the question, “WHAT?!”  This place has EVERYTHING.  Trance, stilts, throw-up music, an albino that looks like Susan Powder, Teddy Graham people...it’s that thing of when a guy has the stumpy arms, but with the belly."
"I was gonna say Just stand alone in your apartment and stretch, but that is still like at least $1800 a month. "
"Dead serious comment

Depending on how bad you want to eat there, you can always slip the maitre d' 40-50 dollars. "
"I feel like anyone rich enough to casually buy an apartment in FiDi for their kid should have like, their own accountant or lawyer to answer stuff like this? "
This sounds like the kind of thing you should consult a lawyer about.
"Those are Hasidic groups, not Orthodox.  I'm not Orthodox, but trust me, most Jews are pretty disapproving of the Hasidic groups/behaviors.  I'd rather not have them associated with the rest of the Orthodox/Jewish community."
He’s waiting for a better offer from someone else aka a stronger applicant. 
"Lol in my NYU days (long ago)  you know a guy really wanted to impress a girl when he took her to Cucina  Di Pesce. That place was like the NYU guy ""closing"" joint.

Oh memories of Cucina di Pesce :-)"
"Are you sure this actually exists? I'm not saying there isn't one somewhere in a park here, but I've never seen a red bench in Central Park as far as I can recall. "
expensive area + educated/well paid renters + old buildings/retail with shady set ups = lots of complaints.
"Not worth getting stabbed. 

On the compassionate hand, these people are not receiving attention for success in their professional life or personal life, so making a spectacle on the subway is really all they have. It's their way of feeling superior to everyone else. It's really quite pitiful."
"everyone's already answered this, but instead of referring to lines by colors, people will rattle off the different train letters that run on that colored line, if that makes any sense.

I've never met anyone who referred to the ""green line"" as being a thing. Instead, people will talk about how you can 4/5/6 will get you to where you need to go (A/C/E, N/W/Q/R etc)"
"Heat must be provided between October 1st and May 31st, i.e. ""Heat Season,"" under the following conditions:

Day

Between the hours of 6:00am and 10:00pm, if the outside temperature falls below 55 degrees, the inside temperature is required to be at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

Night

Between the hours of 10:00pm and 6:00am, the inside temperature is required to be at least 62 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Because I didn't hear the official story from CNN, I heard it from a friend of my fathers who was stuck in the bunker with Giuliani, I heard it from an ex coworker who was head of facilities, I heard it from my best friends father who was a Sargent for the port authority, my ex girlfriends dad who was on scene with the FDNY. I know more people who were effected by 9/11 than I care to quantify, my grandfather and uncles helped build the original buildings, and my friends and colleagues are helping to build the new ones. I find it offensive that some jerkoff in Kenosha with a broadband connection thinks he knows more about 9/11 than anyone I know. It wasn't a TV show for anyone who was here that day, and I'm not gonna just let some idiot turn it into one because they need to escape the reality of senseless violence."
"Few and far between, i know myself and many people in my life find the suggestion highly offensive."
"I really like Cucina di Pesce in the Village. Looks like an upscale Italian eatery. Most entrees are around $15 bucks and even with booze and tip you could probably keep it under $100.

"
"I've met people who call them the ""red line"" or ""yellow line"".... I don't talk to them anymore. "
"It doesn't happen everyday but there is nothing abnormal about the situation. I would just try to find a place as soon as you can, then try to cash in that free month and get the fuck out of there.

Your life could get a little rough once they start renovating units around you.

Also, know that the new management company gives negative fucks about you. Get EVERYTHING in writing, take pictures and videos of everything wrong the upcoming workers do."
You gotta be ready to use force if you are going to confront someone that clearly has some issues acting civilized.
+1 sounds like a dick

"There's a classic NYC article on this topic from Gourmet. They seem to have pulled it off their site, but [here's a transcript](http://david-dat-nguyen.blogspot.com/2011/01/dress-properly-act-dignified-be-polite.html. ). It's a great read. "
"My favorite hole-in-the-wall is Minca Ramen in East Village. They have, I believe, a peanut based broth for their Miso that's very good. It's far more quaint than an Ippudo or Momofuku. "
"Are they warm? Yes. Are they a bit excessive and expensive for a NY winter? Probably. 



You can find good coats for much cheaper. It depends on how important that logo is to you. "
