"I feel like throwing up , throw the whole grandfather away 🤮🤮"
What a title. Congrats.
If cocks could fly my ass would be more of an airport
"You can report the incident to your state medical board, just Google your states department of health and they will have a complaint submission process. But it really won't get you very far for this type of incident. Your best bet is to go to a new doctor.

 I actually think in this situation leaving a terrible Google and Yelp review has more of an impact to warn off potential patients. I'm sorry you had to go through that :("
"&gt; especially as a young gay guy?

I think the younger gay guys are often still in their exploring phase. Gay guys are definitely delayed in the relationship and sex spectrums, since many younger guys in their early 20s are coming out and still learning about themselves and exploring their sexuality.

"
"1. Report this to the police immeadiatly, you have a wealth of evidence against the guy.

2. They won't care about the xanax and alchohol part, they'll care about the rape part and how you clearly did not and could not consent.


3. I know we are kinda in a gay community bubble but this drag queen in the context of the rest of the world would barely register as a celeb. They don't have that much power, and in the time of #metoo anyone can be held liable for their actions. Don't let him get away, because he could be taking advantage of others."
Fuck him again. 
"maybe you just realized that human connection transcedes sex

Suggestion:

 Spend a night alone,just you 2.Chat,drink something,watch a movie then have hardcore sex.If you didn't enjoy it,fine; if you enjoyed it a lot you might as well call yourself 'occasional bisexual' from now on"
"It can happen but it seems most guys just want to play. I was like you when I was younger and  I've only had a small number of partners, all serious but only three turned into long term. I was 49 when I finally met my husband. It's been the best relationship of my life and I think his too. We love each other and there is no one else involved sexually in our lives. Don't despair, "
"First of all, ditch the Dodo. He cheated and he is likely to do it again. Dump him. 

As for you saving his grindr profile and checking up on him, why would you do that (despite that in hindsight you were right)? "
100% yes. 
"&gt;I declined, saying I have a boyfriend

Not to make light of your situation, but this part made me laugh. Like the problem is with you being taken and not him being a freaky freak. 

But no, that's super gross. Definitely tell your family. And your uncle may be a liar, but never assume someone's lying when they say they were sexually abused."
"I put them in the category of potential mate so yes.

Much more so than if they were straight

This is also why I never fall for straight guys"
You’re gonna get white people telling you how you should feel about racism. You don’t have to listen to them. 
"What a weirdo.

*I* like *cock.*"
"Report this to the police.

Also, please stop mixing xanax and alcohol in the future.

You have to be responsible for yourself because no one else will be responsible for you."
This happened to me but the while date was weird. We went bowling and while i was throwing the ball he checked grindr and wasn’t ashamed. I decided to not pay attention to it. It was just a date. After a while he started talking about a dump he once took and how big his turd was and that he rather it go in then out. It was in public. People heard. Gross
"He asked me what I was drinking. It was whiskey, don't remember what anymore. When I told him he said it was his favorite. So I offered him a glass. He accepted and was very flirty. When his drink arrived we toasted and drank. Then he spit it allover the bar and himself and walked away in a hurry. 

An old man saw it all happen. He walked up, took the glass and finished it in one swig. Smiled and thanked me then went back to his seat. I don't offer whiskey to people any more unless they say things that show they actually drink it. That old guy was a legend though."
now u can use grindr to command him to go find clues to solve mysteries and pick up groceries and tootle a silly song on the flute
"""so my boyfriend IM GAY"""
😧
"small step, but so important...congratulation"
I zone out when gays begin talking about other gays and I'm like who are all these people and why does everyone else know them 😛
Because we aren’t as imaginative as we pretend to be. 
Anything drag related
"Fake, but hot."
Now I know how all these twinks managed to stay so skinny. 
"Just for reference:

**DO. NOT. MIX. XANAX. AND. ALCOHOL.**

Benzos (including Xanax) and alcohol have powerful interactions with each other, and these interactions can be fatal."
It’s as simple as having a dick. He doesn’t have one. You like dick. Nothing transphobic about that. 
"- A lot of gay guys have ridiculously unrealistic standards.
- Compromising is seen as a bad thing in this day and age.
- Minuscule dating pool. This isn’t much of a problem when hooking up because you only have to account for attraction and maybe sexual position , but if you want an LTR you have to account for a lot more stuff so the dating pool shrinks even further.
- Lack of gay role models in succesful relationships.
- The stereotype about gay men being promiscuous so some men make it their goal in life to feed into this stereotype as much as they can.
- A lot of us are damaged by society and other people hating us pretty much every day of our lives, so this makes us emotionally unavailable.

Other reasons too, but the above is what I’ve noticed in my personal experience."
Dear diary. 
"I'm upvoting just for the title.

You could potentially be allergic to either his sperm or what he's eating. I read something awhile back about a gal who had a nut allergy (not that kind of nut you pervs), and had a reaction despite never eating or being near nuts. Turns out, her bf ate nuts and his sperm had traces of the nuts in them. 

https://reachmd.com/news/what-allergies-can-be-transmitted-by-having-sex/1390515/

As the article mentions, it is extremely rare. "
"I don't believe you ""owe"" him anything. However, I think you should just talk to him. Let him know your feelings, its not that your transphobic, its that you just didn't understand why he didn't tell you in the first place. You clearly liked him, so before engaging in any sexual act I personal feel it was his responsibility to disclose anything to you before that. If he wasn't ready to let you know, he shouldn't have engaged in sex. He also shouldn't be going around telling people shit about you, that's not okay, I don't know the full story, but from what I read here, you just didn't know, and him being your first trans guy is a big step even for people who know about it beforehand, he should recognize that you also should be aloud to adjust, feel comfortable, or make the decision weather or not you even want to engage in sex with him.

Hope this works out for ya bud."
Neither of you should be in a relationship so you’re perfect for one another. Congrats.

"Oh, good. I was about to freak out and start setting things on fire.

I still might anyway, it's early."

"&gt; i moved country, city, job, and lost friends for this dick

You did this for a relationship that's only now 6 months old? 

Sucks that you got burned, but in the future... Don't do that. Use some common sense. "
I think we all here like dicks ;-)
I don't know if I should feel happy or frustrated about this.

"This student has obviously watched too much gay porn where he thinks it's ok to be inappropriate in class, In real life he can get in trouble for that as it's reality, not gay porn where he thinks it will lead to you 2 having bareback sex in the classroom."
"Too often I think people ok this sub assume one size fits all. I agree with you 100% - not everyone can come out and if it will jeopardize your future in ANY way, DONT do it. Stay in the damn closet until you have the keys to get out of it yourself without anyone’s help. It’s not worth a life of grueling, miserable work because you had to be free at 15 instead of 20."
Same. I don't think much about how hot someone is until I know they're into guys
"There was a dude who lied about his appearance with multiple pictures. I went over to his house and I was ""Uh,  is X here? "" and the guy,  who was a different age, weight, and ethnicity insisted that he was X.  I called him on it and he was in complete denial. In the middle of it, he tried to kiss me, so I just left. He cussed me out as I walked away. "
"If you’re worried about not being believed because the queen has money to get better lawyers and stuff, know that very few of the queens from drag race really make that kind of bank (Willam, Bianca, Alaska, and maybe a few others). Don’t let that hold you back from reporting this"
"What wrong with the word "" ass "" ??  Why y’all hate  that word so much ? "
"Yeah the mods there are garbage. I made a post asking for people to clarify the LGBT terms cuz there are hundreds. (Prep, terf, twink, etc) I got banned for the post without warning, so I checked the rules, all of them allowed the post, I even put a trigger warning, so I messaged them asking why I got banned, then they blocked me. Like wtf. Ur not doing the LGBT community any favors by being so fucking uptight to the point where LGBT people can't ask each other questions"
I liked looking at the half naked guys on the mens underwear packages at the store. 
"This may be crazy coincidental, but my roommate has a friend that claims to have been drugged and assaulted by a queen that was on the most recent season. Go to the police."
"Well umm that’s a new one. 

Top tip. Even if parents are discussing sex do not join in.  They don’t need to know and they shouldn’t know. 

Don’t call him. Text him. Keep it breezy but concerned for him :) "

Maybe your uncle is fucked up *because* grandpa molested him? A lot of child sexual abuse victims turn to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain.
No need to label yourself. Just go for it.
"Also, I'm willing to wager that a lot of straight guys would act the same if more girls were as emotionally crippled as guys are."
"It's me, Laganja"
"Perhaps the reason your uncle is such a mess, is precisely because your grandad molested him. It's pretty common for victims of child sexual abuse. "
"yea kept it saved and even if u delete the app it still saves it which i found handy, my last bf cheated on my im the same way so wanted to be less stubborn this time round... "
"Why am I the first to ask - Why the fuck would you say that to his parents?

I am very liberal, even with my friends parents I have known for a long time, yet I wouldn't even think of saying something like that...?"
"Hearing gay men refer to themselves as ""girls"" or ""gurls"" or to a group of gay men as ""ladies."" "
"I once went on a date with a guy; he took me to a bowling alley. I wasn't really feeling him, so I opened it up out of habit. He noticed, and didn't say anything; I was sorta embarrassed. But, some other bowlers were paying a little *too much* attention to us, and I have this bad habit of trying to shock people like that. So, I loudly mentioned I took this epic shit once and that I'd rather it go in than out. I could tell he was mortified, but I found it worth the sacrifice because the other people heard, too."
"I mean, I struggle with something similar with my friends: 

...They call themselves assholes, but since they know I'm gay and like ass, does that mean they want me to fuck them? I mean, why else would they call themselves something I like, unless they like me, too? They're totally straight by the way, probably, I guess, whatever, I know. I'm planning to propose to them all later tonight, just in case, so it would be really awkward if they actually are 100% straight, like they are."
I relate to this so much 
I just want someone to cuddle.
"I'm not being funny, but if you swallow all the runny cummy your tummy may get crummy. It's not honey, honey. Better take it up the bummy. "
"Hi—I was a peer counselor for a sexual assault and domestic violence crisis line.

1. Do not blame yourself. A person abused their power and took advantage of you while intoxicated. (People in this thread are victim blaming. Not cool.)

2. Do what you think is an appropriate next step. Gain back control. You courageously went to the hospital. As next steps—you can choose to report to the police or not. That is your prerogative. 

3. I would advise building support for yourself so you can get through this and be healthy. Whether it’s your friends/family/loved ones, local centers, hotlines, counselor/therapist/etc. I can also be a resource.

Around gays: I show them my ass.."

"Hmmm, need more information. Please submit an HD video of the next time this happens so the Gay Science Council can evaluate the phenomenon and determine its cause. It's important for the perpetuation of The Agenda. "
"Oh man I could’ve written this word by word. My partner passed away in 2012 (I too was 26 at the time). You never truly move on from something like this, but there will come a point when you look back and his memory will give you comfort instead of the pain you’re feeling right now. I can’t say how long that will take for you, for me it happened around the 2.5 year mark, but I promise you will get there.

In my case the thing that helped me the most was to hang out occasionally with people who cared deeply about him (ie. his direct family) because in a sense they understood my pain and were going through a similar ordeal as me, so try to do that if at all possible. I found that other people who werent’t that close to him would usually make things worse, even if it came from a genuine place of wanting to help. They would give me generic feel-better crap like “everything happens for a reason” and shit like that which would leave me feeling more empty.

Ohhh and don’t let anyone tell you how to mourn. It’s YOUR grief, YOUR process, and it’s different for everyone. Ignore anyone who says you’ve mourned too long and that it’s time to move on. It will take however long it takes.

I’m here if you need to talk."
Cockpit sounds awesome. 
"I'm a straight woman so I'm not really sure why I'm on this sub, but I just noticed something about your language and I wanted to comment on it.

You say that you're 'wheelchair bound' and you're 'stuck in a wheelchair'. For the past few months I've been working with kids with disabilities and we, at all costs, avoid using language like this. Instead, we say 'wheelchair user'. It's a really subtle change, but it's a really important one. Your wheelchair isn't something that you're stuck in or bound to, it's an amazing piece of equipment that you can use to help you do anything you want to do. 

I can't imagine how hard it must be to go from being able bodied to needing to use a wheelchair, but from the way you talk about your wheelchair I can tell that it's difficult. Understandably so. However, for what it's worth, I can tell you that the kids that I worked with who used wheelchairs were able to do absolutely everything that everyone else was able to do. Sure, we had to make the occasional adjustment but we always got there in the end. Always. Maybe adjusting your language will help you start to view your chair in a more positive light.

As for would I date a guy that uses a chair, you can bloody bet I would!"

"&gt; I'm a trash can of fuck ups and problems

Lol. Sounds damn familiar.

The movie that night you guys hooked up wasn't *Funny Games* by any chance, was it? Because that would make me very concerned about the fact you're taking advice from someone who tells you to keep fucking women so you don't turn a 100% gay."

"It sounds like self-image was previously tied with their position/roles in sex, and that's being challenged here. "
"Me too. Looking at a stereotypical hot person(like Chris Hemsworth) does absolutely nothing for me, and trying to have sex with them would be like trying to have sex with a woman. It will simply not work.    "
It's fake. Like this is worse than big bang theory writing
"""Can I get a ride home?""

-- Dude who lived two blocks away from the bar, who was at the bar with his partner, who was good enough to at least walk home. Once I dropped him off he wanted to repay the kindness by giving me and my buddy a nightcap.  We obliged.  Partner came home a few minutes later.  They called up a few friends.  Houseparty ensued with a naked cuddleparty (but not quite orgy) in their backyard/pool.  

Definitely a fun night, but I was quite miffed at the realization this was an invite to their place under the guise of leveraging my good nature and I'm probably the middle in a long line of 'victims'"
"I had a guy who I was talking to who seemed cute, super horny and had done a lot of the things I’d fantasized about. Then he said we should hook up, but first it’d be hot if I hooked up with an fwb of his. The fwb was not someone I’d be attracted to at all. 

It basically boiled down to the first account being a fake to get me to hook up with the second account. "
"Poor Jakey, surrounded by idiots. "
"That's wonderful, man. I'm happy for you."
"There was a time, from 1983 to 1997, where this was happening to me virtually every week, with AIDS.  By my mid 30s every single peer of my lover and I had died of the plague.  We were the only ones left standing.  Feeling emotions people generally feel in their mid to late 70s.  Those men were the most beautiful and creative men of my generation.  I wonder what our world would be now if they had lived and contributed.

I pray God this will be your only encounter with this for some decades to come.  It shows how precious life is, and how we must never take it for granted.  This day you are living is not a dress rehearsal.  This day is your life!  It's show time folks.  Suit up, show up, and take big bites of today."
"Look, your boyfriend needs a better place and apparently your house, even full with stuff and people, is better than his grandparents's or his parents's house. It can be tough in the beginning, but you family can adapt to your boyfriend and viceversa. Invite him. It's not what you both want but it's probably the best thing to do under the circumstances. I wish you good luck."
Essentially anytime a guy tries to bond with me by making derogatory comments about women
It sums up what already happened. I enjoyed it a lot but it was followed by a deep and awful void I couldn't get rid of when I got home.
Same. I prefer guys who aren't extraordinary because I like to make them feel extraordinary. And there's beauty in almost everyone.
lol I like how you just kinda slipped it in there
"No, they're warm. "
Suck his dick
Thanks 👍🏾
That's against the law. Sue. That's a HIPA violation. Literally will lose his license for that.
"And he actively lied to OP, that alone is enough for a breakup."
"Yeah. Straight means waste of time. 

If I’m unsure there’s a level of attraction which intensifies if they’re gay and practically extinguishes if they’re straight. 

Straight guys can be good-looking but they’re isn’t any attraction. I find myself going from subjectively checking them out to contrasting stuff like “that’s my goal size for my biceps” as if they were just reference material.

Same detachment from sexual attention working in healthcare. All the patients are unethical to pursue intimately so there just isn’t an attraction from me."
You can report him to the police
"OP let me tell you, you're always going to be getting those kinds of messages on Gay apps. I'm 26 going on 27 and I've been getting those throughout the whole time I tried gay online dating (since I was 18). It really doesn't go away so it's best to just ignore them. I personally like to make a joke out of it now where if people say things to me like ""BBC?"" or ""You got BBC?"" or ""I want you to fuck me with your BBC"", I like to respond saying ""You got money?""or ""$100"". I have absolutely no intention of prostituting but I do this to try to discourage these same guys from messaging me because back then, I would have so many repeats ofo the same guys asking me over and over again when I've already made it clear on my profile in **3 fucking places** that I'm not even a top. 

So yeah, it may sound seedy but I find that giving responses that imply they need to pay you tend to drive them away from ever messaging you again and if the guy does offer the cash, just block them after. 

I wish I could tell you it gets better but it doesn't, this is something all Black gay guys are gonna get no matter what they look like because porn has warped people's minds when it comes to minorities. "
"One of my boyfriends in high school identified as bi at the time we were dating. In college, he started identifying as straight again. Though we also hooked up again in college when visiting. He later told a mutual close high school friend of ours that I'm the only guy he's ever been attracted to. 

I've seen you reference in other comments how you feel bad after hooking up with your friend. Having conflict about what you think your identity is is real and confusing, but you should give yourself permission to explore what you want without it being freighted with so much importance and meaning. You're not hurting anyone or doing anything wrong. You're just learning more about yourself, and your self conception can catch up later."

"It’s not about being gay,
Its commonly called ""love"".
Enjoy this feeling pal."
"My doctor gave me an HIV test because I’m gay before asking me my sexual history...I’m a virgin. I was too embarrassed to say anything though. I’m surprised because he thought I’m actually having sex after he saw my flaccid dick for an exam, which is about 1”. I googled him and turns out he is anti-women and anti-LGBT rights and openly publishes documents against birth control, trans therapies, etc."
"As someone who once been that guy all I could say is don't push the subject and give him space. Mostly act like nothing happened. He will need time to digest this and he will figure it out. What he doesn't need is further pressure.
But I'm sure that won't work with everyone. Hopefully more advice will come. "
Contact your insurance company and let them know and they should walk you through on how to file a grievance. This affects the bottom dollar for the doctor as the insurance will not allow anyone receiving such negative reports to remain empaneled (think in their network).
You don't need to feel threatened or take it personally if he's checking out porn.
"It's fairly common. For me, bottoming is sometimes so intense that I just want to focus on the one feeling at a time, at which point it becomes an incredibly sexual experience which doesn't involve the penis at all. Like, I know I can get off any time - I just want to enjoy \*this\* while it's happening, and finish later. "
This was an enjoyable fake story to read
"God, I hate ""pussy"" ""boi pussy"" or any variation. Maybe it's just because I'm bi, but I like my men to be men and there to be no uncertainty I'm fucking a dude. "
"He told me he wanted to split a cab because he lived near me. I didn't know him that well, friend of a friend, but I split it with him. We got off at my house and he saw all the kid stuff in my yard. He then tried to make conversation about kids. He told me he had seven kids and was married and bi like me. We hooked up. Turns out he had no kids and was gay."
"I mean, if she's allergic to his nut, isn't it still a nut allergy? 🤔"
It’s not just gay porn. Every single teen show on cable television has a teacher-student sex storyline
"He’s stringing you on for his own self gratification.

You’re not a toy, not expendable, and you shouldn’t be picked up and dropped whenever it’s convenient. You’re worth more than that.

Tell him you’re tired of being messed around and move on."
Whenever they kill off the only hot guy on a show I like I start contemplating whether it's worth watching anymore
"I think it is perfectly acceptable to say to a guy, while you have his dick in your hand, ""Are you sti/std/hiv/herpes free?"" And if he gets all flustered, end the evening right there. Not to mention, we all should be having safe sex when we hookup anyway. I haven't hooked up with anyone in 10 years....was married for 5....husband died of a heart attack (related to thyroid disease and diabetes.) When I went back out into the dating world I was older and not looking for a hookup, on the random time I did, I asked all kinds of questions....and had safe sex. Then I ran into, quite accidentally, my next husband. Been together 4 years, first year was safe sex and testing."
"For some reason people think of doctors as if they were gods. They’re not. She was being paid a lot of money for seeing you and she should treat you with respect and take your concerns seriously. If she does not meet your expectations or provides unsatisfying service, you have the right to ask for another doctor and explain your reasons to the establishment or if another doctor is unavailable you can always choose to go elsewhere. Don’t be afraid to call them out if they’re being unprofessional. "

"I had a doctor like that once too.   A prospective employer had sent a request for a general check-up, and they had even said on their list “No HIV test necessary.”

  The doctor asked me a series of about 20 questions and when he got to “I ask people if they’re homosexual.”  I said yes.   He said “What?  You are?”  
And he demanded an HIV test.  Keep in mind I had just had my first kiss with a man a couple of weeks before and that was about it.  I had absolutely zero risk for HIV but he said “I am not going to sign any letter for a homosexual without an HIV test.”

  He gave me a piece of paper and told me to bring it to the lab but not to open it to look at it myself.  I peeked anyway and saw that he had written “risk: HOMOSEXUAL” on the top in huge letters.  
  He sent a letter to my employer saying that “He had a series of tests including an HIV test and no health issues have been found.”"
"jesus lol  


I had a different grindr guy say he wanted to date me and i was like that's cool i'm not opposed to trying to date and then he started cussing me out calling me fake and a slut. turns out he was simultaneously messaging me on a second account, sending pictures of someone really attractive, asking if i wanted to hook up, and i'd said yeah. guy has two accounts and sends people so he can see if someone is ""cheating on him"" (five minutes after we agree to have a first date). Thank goodness he did that so i didn't go on a date with him"

Some gay men are insecure and base their personality on prominent gay stereotypes and media. Some gays are insecure and define themselves by making sure people know they are **not** being that. Different strokes. 
"No. If you keep splitting up subreddits they will all become smaller and less active.

The mod of my city subreddit keeps creating separate subs for different things people post about like food, pictures of the city, people asking about moving to our city, etc. what is there left to talk about on the main sub if everything has their own subreddit?"
"Hey, there,

I'm sorry that this happened, but you have to bounce back: that's what your boyfriend would want of you, wouldn't he?--to see you both Healthy and Happy, and Thriving again at Life after a reasonably brief period of mourning his passing.

Come now. You can do this. Do it for yourself. Do it for him.

Good luck. :)"
I mean that's the objective here
"I feel like you left an important part of the story out.  What happened when you found out he is trans?  Because all you say is that you found out, and now he is telling everyone you are transphobic.  Was there something that happened when you found out or something you said that would have led there? Did you break up? Did you accuse him of being deceptive?  What exactly happened and what did you say? Because it would seem odd if you found out, didn't react, and then he tells people you are transphobic.

Ignoring that, some people think that if you don't want to have sex with someone who has a vagina, you are transphobic.  It's incredibly stupid. I'm not sure if that's what happened here or if you said something, but I guess that is a possibility here."
"I'm a journalist. I once told a guy at a bar my profession. He said me too. I said I work at _______. He said he freelances. I asked where. He said Rolling Stone. Suspicions raised. I asked him what in particular he writes about? He said the music scene, not picking up on my skepticism. I asked him who was his editor. He goes blank. I can't hold it in any longer and I burst out laughing. He gives me a confused look. I tell him I need to get back to my friends.

Note to liars out there: If you're going to pretend to have a particular vocation, do not choose the profession of the person you are talking to at that moment. Most likely they will know you are not telling the truth."
"and just really pisses me off, i gave up so much to move here and be with him, and he gives the most pathetic amount of effort... i moved country, city, job, and lost friends for this dick "

"I had a dream I was married and we had adopted kids...

I helped with homework, made snacks. I was so proud of my boy, he had just hit half of Rosetta Stone Spanish. It was a clear night, so we took the telescope out. My husband knew more about it than I did, and we looked at the stars through it and laughed and pointed out constellations.

I woke up alone of course... I'm not married and I don't have any kids... But for several minutes I felt like everything had been ripped away from me and I just cried."

"I wish I knew. Sometimes I think it has something to do with how when we come out, it's generally later in life and so we have to go through the whole experimental phase and it sucks for those who couldn't care less. 

Throw in dating apps, social media, and a generation plagued with fears of commitment and financial instability and you've got a mess. I wish it wasn't like this either because it's unbelievably lonely. "
Finally had to tell one of my old friends I was gay because she had no clue. Her response was “but you work at Autozone” 😂
"Only half-jokingly. It's a stereotype that women are more in touch with their emotions than men and while I don't think that's universally true, it has some merit to it. Meanwhile men are taught from a young age that showing emotions is undesirable. Crying is only for girls, you're a dweeb if you like something passionately (aside from sport and country) and of course, real men aren't afraid of anything.

I'm no scientist but I can only guess this is deeper ingrained in the way a guy's brain is wired."

"You can breakup with him without revealing that you know what he’s up to. It does sound like you invested a lot for him, and that will and should make you cautious the next time around.

"Yes, you were deceived. He used his physical appearance to fool you into believing he was the opposite sex. He should have disclosed his sex/gender prior to being intimate with you, because then you would have an informed choice to make.

What he did was prevent you from making an informed decision, and that is not right. Since he is already telling people you are anti-trans...that means the relationship is over. I would run away from him ASAP and cut off all contact."

"When I was like 19, this guy tried to lure me into a “date“ (but with a “we’ll see where it goes ;-)” attached. He tells me he’s never kissed a guy or held hands but he wants to take me out and experience a date. I had dated almost not at all, and had barely just lost my virginity, so I said sure. Found out before the date that my best friend had fucked this guy bareback in his car about a year prior. This guy was catholic, and would apparently sleep with guys who “didn’t want to hookup” and then would send them messages about being sinners and going to hell and talk about how he had “found God again” and would block you. I convinced him to talk to my best friend and I on the phone and we tried to coach him through his religious dilemma. He ended up not liking our compromising opinions and blocked us. Months later my best friend and I stopped by his place of work (coincidentally) and decided to check out at his register. He was eye-fucking me the entire time, but apparently only recognized my friend (since we’d never met) and I messaged him to follow up on that and he said “I didn’t recognize it was you, but I thought you were hot and wanted to take you to the bathroom and have you fuck me lol”. He immediately flipped script again when I confirmed that I would not be hooking up with him. It was entertaining."
"He's an alcohol/drug addict that has claimed he's sober with an empty bottle of vodka in his hand. He's also claimed (numerous times) that my mother sells crack (she doesn't). 

I understand and agree with your point in premise, but my uncle is the exception here. I do find it easier to empathize with why he started drinking now. "
"I don’t know why everyone is telling you to run. You’re upset, he is upset, you’re both reacting to feelings that are raw and maybe new territory for each other. 

Go talk to him. 

Anecdote, but: my Mom has an STD given to her by my cheating dad. She won’t die by it, but it is a source of shame for her. When she broke up with my dad she shared that the hardest thing about dating was liking a guy and investing in them knowing she had a black mark from her past. When she chose to have the talk, she said it was the hardest thing she had to do. Some men rejected her that day. Others didn’t. She is now married.

Imagine being trans. That is my Mom x100. He fights every day to affirm who he is. You loved him. He loved you. But he was scared. And I’m sure that fear was why it took so long for him to share. 

Go talk to him."

"I came out to my best friend in high school, not with any ulterior motive, just because I wanted to be honest with him... he responded by confessing he had a crush on me.

we dated (or whatever the equivalent of dating is when you're afraid to spend much time in public just the two of you) for the next ~2.5 years, breaking up the summer after graduation. the relationship was largely big group activities, hanging out after school, and him sneaking over to my house after my parents went to bed. after he got a car, we'd also go to the mall and hangout. 

we broke up after I came out to our friends and my family, and he didn't want people to make the connection of associating him with a gay guy.

I don't regret the experience or anything, but as far as relationships go, in retrospect it doesn't really hold a candle to any adult relationship I've had with another out guy."

Just straight up tell him “you are making me uncomfortable and this relationship is strictly professional, I am not interested in you.  I don’t want to to have to report you but if you don’t stop making advances I will have no choice but to do so.”  It may upset him, but it is professional and will deliver the message"

Yup I got banned from there for saying it's not wrong to prefer masculine guys. That's the thing about that sub it's all about coddling hypersensitive people despite how unreasonable they maybe. I don't think that the bf is a bigot and I understand why you would defend him as I saw your post about breaking up with your ex because he became a drag queen and you couldn't see him as masculine you both are very similar in the sense that you both don't view things at face value but you guys view things as more of an abstract concept meaning that what they are is more than the here and now which is valid.
Yes! Make it an elaborate proposal to. Write him a song and perform it in a crowded public place like a mall or the park. Really go all out. Wear a white silk suit and white platform shoes. 
Now you know the secret. Keep it to yourself. This is rule one of gay club.

"We met when I was 19, and he was 22. We were immediately smitten with each other and really well suited to one another. I was newly out of the closet, painfully shy and introverted. He was out and proud, extroverted and the life of the party. I don't know what he saw in me, but he guided me through the himalayas of him-a-laying and I couldn't have asked for a better friend and confidant. 

I introduced him to my sisters first. I introduced him to my parents and brother next. Everyone took to him really well, and he basically became another part of the family. We spent like 4 out of 7 days of the week together. He would come over to my parent's house, or I more often would go to his. We ended up moving in together at like 6 months into our relationship, and were engaged shortly after we'd been together for a year. We adopted our first dog, and started saving up money for a house over a wedding. 

The years flew by, and our lives continued to change. He got a promotion, I changed career paths and went back to school to better myself and finish college. He supported me through the long hours while I worked full time, and then came home to work on homework in the evenings. We bought our house, and adopted other pets over the years. But as I began to change, so did he. 

What began with nights out on the town and aching hangovers the following day progressed for him into a habit of daily drinking. I'd come home and find a bottle of wine chilling in the refrigerator, or that the brand new bottle of vodka we'd been saving for the weekend had been opened and he was chilling out on the couch - unwiding after a long day at work. It made me uneasy, having watched my mother struggle with her own alcohol addiction my entire life. I'd ask him to slow down, or question if he really needed another drink, but he was always ""fine,"" or would assure me that this was his ""last one of the night"" - it never was. 

What began as funny drunk stories about him sort of became a dismal reality for me over time as he continued to get worse. I have so many stories about him ruining family gatherings or holidays with embarrassing drunk antics. I no longer found that aspect of himself funny. I found it disturbing, and it made me angry to have to deal with a grown adult who regressed into childlike behavior when he was blackout drunk. I harbored a lot of resentment towards him because of it, and sort of closed myself off emotionally. I spent more time by myself, reading and blogging, while he got wasted and intimacy between us slowly fell away. 

I noticed him getting more and more secretive with his phone. We'd never kept locks on our phones in all the years we'd been together, but suddenly his had one. When we would watch TV or a movie together, he'd text through the entire thing, always keeping his phone angled away from me. I'm not proud of it, but curiosity got the best of me and I watched him enter his password one night, memorized it, and logged in after he'd passed out. What I found were dozens of text message conversations with gay dudes all throughout the area we lived in. 

Flirtatious messages and sometimes outright sexting with attractive guys I know he'd never even met in person yet  befriended on facebook because he wanted ""friends that were gay,"" over the years. Worse, were the ways he would tell these guys that he and I were open - we never had been - and that we were actively searching for threesomes or more - we definitely were not. 

It really ate me up inside. My fiance, my first, my only, was looking elsewhere for something I couldn't provide him. I called him out on it. He cried and made excuses. He was only looking for attention or validation that he was still attractive. He was drunk. He made every excuse he could and promised he would change, and stupidly I always bought it - until the day that I didn't anymore. 

Until the day that I recognized that what I once had felt for him as passion and romantic love had withered and died. Fallen away and replaced only by friendship. Perhaps also comfort and familiarity. We were together not because we were in love, but because it was easy and safe to stay. 

I ended it with him just shy of the 10 year mark. I'm single and mingling now, and picking up the pieces of my life. I'm in no hurry to dive into another long term relationship just yet - though I do miss the intimacy and closeness of it. It's definitely weird though, being in the last years of my 20s and sort of starting fresh. Sleeping with other people for the very first time in my life and really seeing what else is out there. 

It would be easy to regret those years, or to see them as time wasted. I don't though. I had fun, most of the time. I was with my best friend almost constantly for 9 years. We made a lifetime worth of memories in that short span of time together. It's just time for new memories. A new beginning to a new chapter in the book that is me. 

TL;DR: Spent 9.5 years together with my first boyfriend. Broke up with him earlier this year and am single at 28 years old for pretty much the first time in my life. Shit's scary but I'm dealing. "
That's what I'm thinking now.

"Interesting! No nut allergy but AM allergic to some shellfish. That's definitely something to think about, thank you!"
"Yeah I do get sad about that sometimes. I just get tired of noticing cute guys while I’m out and about, and suddenly remembering that I probably don’t even have a chance because he’s probably straight. "
Am I the only one here who's into guys?
"Go to a doctor immediately, tell them the situation and get on PEP, it's a drug effective at eliminating HIV within the first 72 hours of exposure. 

Also, that guy raped you. So, perhaps afterwards you might want to talk to someone else about that. "
"It's a bit inappropriate to suggest that his case is shaky because he didn't verbally retract consent. OP retracted consent the moment he became blackout drunk and high on xanax. Oh and also when he said ""I don't want to go further."" This would be a close and shut case especially if the perpetrator was sober. Anything but a clear ""yes"" is basically not consent."

"After reading the other things you have said about them, have a backup plan. 

Arrange for someone to come by and interrupt the meeting after a half hour, explain that you are needed at work and ask you to accompany them away. 

Arrange for someone to call to interrupt the meeting. 

Plan to get up and excuse yourself to the bathroom to get your self back under control if needed. 

Remember, don’t give away your power, don’t let her provoke you into anger. If she swipes something that makes you mad, stand up and say, “I really regret having to cut this short, but I have a commitment.” 

Do not “loose it” and go off because it will put you in a weak position. State disagreement calmly and end the meeting. Hope all this is help and you find something you can use. 

My own parents put me through ex gay therapy when I was 15. Today I live 3000 miles away and they boycotted my wedding. My list, like yours goes on and on, so be careful with yourself. Don’t over invest in a first meeting attempt. Good luck. "

"If you need help, you can also call RAINN at 800-656-4673. That is the National Sexual Assault Crisis line. They can talk with you and point you in the direction of local resources.

sis what we’re not going to do is try to guilt a victim of sexual assault into naming their rapist because you want drama. lots of victims don’t feel comfortable publicly shaming the person who attacked them and for you to act like the only way for it to be true is if they name their attacker is irresponsible and cruel tbh

"You don't ""owe"" him a second chance. You didn't ""owe"" him a first one. Nobody gets to demand that you date or don't date anyone else. If someone is mad, tell them to mind their own business, you don't want to discuss it. 

Here are some data points for talking it over. 

1) Deal with the lie. He had a responsibility to tell you before he went all the way with you. Discuss that with him. 

2) Whether or not you guys end the relationship or continue it, you both need to respect each other and keep it between you two. 

You should ask that he stop telling people you are transphobic, that using mob anger won't motivate you to appreciate his points of view. 

You should insist that the conversation discuss your feelings of betrayal. He could have trusted you enough to be honest. 

To the other people, tell them it isn't their business, and you think it is important for you and him to work this out before it becomes front page news. "

"When they start acting ""shady"" or basically like assholes for no reason but it's supposed to be cute or funny? I guess that's how some gay guys become friends, because they show off how edgy and ""cunty"" they are? Im not into it."
"I don't like people who delight in offending others. If people are constantly telling you you're an asshole and you choose to wear that as a badge of honor instead of trying to become a better person, I want fuck all to do with you."
Um....why does this sound so familiar? 
My boyfriend and I only do anal once in a blue moon. It's possible to have a satisfying sex life without it just may take a little time.
He's looking for Precious Astral Moon Flower Love to please his fragrant butthole.
Hard agree.

"They may be gone on your end but not necessarily gone on Grindr's end. I imagine their servers would have to keep copies of messages for situations like these where law enforcement has an investigation. Reporting on Grindr is fine and all but it doesn't open an investigation with law enforcement. If this is a persistent and worrying issue, go to the police and bring any screenshots or other evidence you may have. At least get it on an official report in case things escalate later on."
"Would you like to go on a date?  Lol, I’m 30, I’ve been wondering the same thing for years.  Every guy I meet only wants to hookup.  Even after a few dates, mention that I want marriage, kids, etc.  poof!  They’re gone.  Lol"

"Hey, I'm really hairy myself and I love it. Most of the guys I've dated were drooling over my hairy ass. I used to hate it before because I started growing a mustache in 6th grade. By the end of 9th grade I could grew a full beard. I was teased a lot because of it. I hated it at first, and used to Nair and shave my hairy body all over. I finally said fuck it, and let it grow, I loved every inch of it. once I started college, let's just say I had a lot of fun ;-) "
"Yes 

I immediately ignore anyone who contacts me on the dating services and has some political rant in their blurb. 

I honestly don't care that Jeremy Corbyn is the greatest man ever or that Brexit is bad when I am on a dating site "
"Don’t get into a relationship with a laundry list of things you won’t do. Come in with your values and an open mind. In time, you and your partner will compromise within reason and find out whatever works. 

The best way to be disappointed is to expect people to change for you, but not be willing to change for them."
"Love, Simon. I know it's an easy answer, but I honestly haven't seen that many other gay movies aside from Brokeback Mountain.

Moonlight was good, but it was a bit depressing for my tastes."
"Even if this is real and not fake, you're barking up the wrong tree. Go to the fucking police. No matter how terrible the police and the world are, you can't imagine that writing this on a website will actually solve this huge trauma and problem for you. You're gonna have to go to the police and get counselling or some type of real life help."
"&gt; a couple months ago my friends all voted that I was the straightest one in the group.

99% chance the friend that initiated this vote is gay. "

This...100% it’s the one exception to the rule. If you can’t afford it don’t come out. This is the one time life is harder.

"I’m a heterosexual female here- just saw this question while browsing r/all.

I don’t think your problem is just a “gay guy” thing. If heterosexual men could easily find women that consented to open relationships, threesomes, orgies and casual sex then trust me NONE of us would be married and settled down with kids.

It’s just that heterosexual guys know they don’t have that many options, (ie traditionally women are less likely to want an open relationship or be content with multiple partners), so men know that if they kept behaving that way eventually they’d end up with no one. 

You’re not one of “the few gay guys” who are looking for love...you’re actually one of “the few GUYS” who are looking for love.

Aaaaaaannnd I realise I have added nothing to this conversation to make you feel better. Sorry.

"I'm looking at this from your husband's POV. I think if I were him, I would want to know what's bothering you, and would want to know about therapy. I would hope he'd be supportive of your decision, but I don't think leaving him in the dark about this is a good plan. 

You guys obviously love each other, it may be a hurdle to overcome, but I'm sure things would be fine if you told him.

Also, good luck on the immigration process! "
Is that the bi agenda? Only been privy to the gay agenda.
No it actually doesn't.
