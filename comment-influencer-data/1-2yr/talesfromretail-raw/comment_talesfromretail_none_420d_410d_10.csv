This is the best outcome of any “Your coupon won’t work” story ever.
"Some people are thick, with an unhealthy dose of rude! One of my team, having clocked out and thrown a jacket on, decided to do a bit of shopping afterwards. So, she's grabbed a couple of whole chickens from the reduced section, and then went over to chat with one of the counter colleagues. Important to mention is that she brought her trolley with her, ie didn't leave it by the reduced fridge. 

Anyway, her trolley nudges her, she turns, and a customer was rooting through her trolley, and then grabbed the chickens! 

Long argument later, she got them back, but the lady had had much the same mindset as your customer; you work here, so I have full rights over your items. Urgh!"
"Had this happen with a female co-worker in an electronics store, she came and got me after he insisted she couldn't help him with his problem.
Now the fun part is  I was new and she was the veteran, so I casually asked this guy what the wanted, took some notes then told them I wasn't sure but I did know who could help him. 
They thanked me I walked off.... And came back with original female co-worker. The look on his face was priceless then he just stormed out.

Worth it.

"i have had so many things fall into that tiny slot. kool aid packets, cards, money... please, for the love of god do not count all your cash out on the automatic conveyor belt."
"What is the point of having loss prevention if you ha e a policy like that? It's like buying a car and leaving it in the garage. Yeah, you can say you have it, but it seems like a waste of money if it's never actually used."
I just feel awful for the wife :(
Let's see... one dollar... hey where'd the dollar go? One dollar.... hey where'd the dollar go? One dollar.....
"“Sure, these ones are $50 apiece. I take cash, check, PayPal or Venmo.” "
"i worked at a paint store and had a similar situation. Guy came in to pick out paint  for outside of his house. We have a bunch of colours thay are selected for outside paint, they will look good on a house, muted etc. But we can tint any colour. He picks a blue more suited to inside, i show him the outside colours and suggest one of those and explain why. He says no he wants the blue. I suggest one can to try he says no he wants all 30. I explain he cant return them once tinted, he doesnt care do them all. Next day phone call from angry wife why we tinted them all such a horrible colour, with him whining in the background that we ""made him do it"". "
"Now I'm picturing this old lady going at her lasagna with a reciprocating saw, just vibrating in place as cold chunks of pasta and sauce fly off at high speeds.

Wear your eye protection folks."
"Yup, had this happen too, at a previous parts store I worked at. Customers insisted I couldn't help. I wouldn't even leave the counter, my coworker would hear their question and look puzzled, turn to me and ask what to do or what to get. They'd get sooo mad, but they were the idiots in the first place!"
I know. I felt bad for her. He was an arse for putting her in that position. Clearly thinking it was unlikely that the person that sold it would be the same person there when he sent her back to return it!
"I'm a guy.  When I'm in a typically male-dominated store (hardware, auto parts, sporting goods, etc.) and I need help and a woman is working, I go to her.  I figure if she's working here she probably knows her stuff like no one else, and she's probably not going to make fun of me if I have to ask a few questions about whatever it is along the way.  


Farmer Bubba doesn't know what he's missed out on.  His loss."
Sounds like y'all need some curtains or blinds you can pull shut when the store is closed.
"&gt;I cannot believe that somehow this guy got it in his head that it was okay to ask literally 5 different people over the course of his two visits the same question. Why do you expect a different answer? 

Because if he hears a ""Yes"" on that delivery from a single person, no matter if he didn't give them all the details, he will bitch and complain that you said yes and how can you go back now and how dare you I'll call the BBB...."
"The gist of it was my colleague pointing towards the reductions fridge and telling the woman that there *are* more, and the woman getting snarky, wanting the ones *right here*, how dare my colleague try to inconvenience her and be so rude.

Now, my colleague, M, is a very feisty little creature, so there was a blistering response, stating that she's off the clock, she's a paying customer also, so she doesn't have to be polite to *anyone* pawing through her shopping, and if those chickens weren't put back, complaints would be made.

If only I'd discovered Reddit by then, it was golden, M went into full blown scary teacher mode, is the best way to describe it, if you can picture it."
"The COO of Harley-Davidson told me a similar story.

Woman walks in to a Harley dealership and spends about an hour purchasing a new Harley.  Picked every option and detail, knew everything about it.  She was dressed head-to-toe in leather, carrying a helmet.

The genius salesman says, ""Okay, so who's going to drive it home for you?""

Turns out this was a relative of one of the founders."
I always wondered why people assume that everything in a store display is pristine but if it touches a floor for a second it is contaminated beyond all hope.  
Better business bureau.  Lol ok lady. Call them see how much it doesnt matter. 
"\&gt; """"But you work for this store, so the store still owns them.""

""Well, I own these shoes. Does that mean the store owns those too? My car is parked in employee parking, also owned by the store, yet I'm the one making car payments. Does the store own that too? It looks like you're parked in our lot. I guess as a store member I own your car now too."""
"Interestingly, in Norway (not sure about the rest of Europe, outside Scandinavia), phone books are no longer published, but cell phone numbers are easily found from free online search services, unless you opt out.

I grew up with this being the norm and was taken aback when I was living in the US and I was invited to a party at a colleague's place, but he never told me where he lived. I didn't have the person's cell phone number and there were zero ways to find it. Ended up having to contact multiple other colleagues, awkwardly asking for the guy's address. Still never got the guy's number, but the party was a blast."
Sounds like you were exactly where you should have been. I think they needed that more than you know.
In the...tv? I'm dumbfounded 
"Do you have a receipt?

No.

 Did you pay with a card because I can look up transactions in this store with your card? 

No, I payed cash. I want my cash back.

Do you have an account with us? 

No.

WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO THEN?!?!

Every damn day... 
"
"&gt; happy to help every customer with a smile


Those days are looooooooong gone"
"I was worried this story would be a downer, but it just made me smile."
"Great, now I have /r/TalesFromRetail blue balls from not being able to vicariously be angry.

That's a really heartwarming tale! Those were the kinds of interactions that almost made those jobs worth it.

Almost."
I love it when they admit they were wrong and learn their lesson. That's a happy ending for this subreddit.
"""I won't tip you if this thing that is totally out of your control happens"""
"I sort of think in this case, it's not so much can't read as that she thought she shouldn't have to do the socially accepted thing of waiting for her turn.  MeMeMe Syndrome has become extremely contagious lately, and people like her are cropping up everywhere. (Looking at the lady who pushed past me while I was carrying a hot tray of food and thought yelling 'excuse me' while pushing past was the right thing to do.)"
I would have enjoyed being a fly on the wall for that. How did your colleague react? What was said in the exchange if you can recall?
"""They weren't open when they said they weren't open! Please downgrade this business!"""
_Sexism_
"Sounds like my dad, you can't send him on any errand where he needs to make a decision where one might need to use their sense of taste, he will always default to the ugliest choice. 

"
"I was in line behind an ancient woman at a grocery store. All her items had gone through and time to pay, but instead of moving forward toward the debit machine, she placed her coins on the MOVING conveyor belt. The cashier didn’t have time to react before they got sucked up into the abyss. 

I just mentally sighed and felt bad for the lady. I bet she was pretty embarrassed. "
o.o I wonder if she had been ingesting mercury
"*Goddamn*, that's a quick way to not just lose a sale, but probably your nuts and your job!"
"Can also relate, currently managing an electronics store and the most recent was an older man, I said ""HI! What can I do for you?"" and I got the palm up and head shake, he ""no offense, but preferred to wait for one of the guys, cause they'll be able to fix it."" I said sure and let him know I'd be around of he changed his mind and didn't want to wait. The guy he was waiting for was one of my noobs. So I let him wait, lol.. Until the noob came to get me so I could fix his tablet. He turned red and said nothing and mumbled a thank you after. "
Omg this is so sad but also heartwarming at the same time. I’m sure you truly made that couples day. ❤️
"I dont know about any actual stores, but i worked at a gas station’s little convenience shop and we werent allowed to stop people from stealing.  Instead we had to allow them to steal. The reason being because if the company gave us the go ahead to stop a thief the company would then be liable if we were to be harmed. So basically the company would rather lose a small amount of money from a theft, than have to pay medical bills for someone who attempted to stop the theft"
"Thank you for supporting the women who are trying, simply a polite customer is appreciated. In fact, the only guy in my department (except for our techs) quit, so now we are all, including my immediate manager, women. I love the look on the cranky old guys' faces when they find that out. They waste their time continually asking for somebody ""higher up.""

I don't fret about the guys who walk away, or want to ""speak with a man."" I have experience, and generally the guy they ask to speak to needs me to help him, or is busy doing his actual job and the customer has to wait. That is also very satisfying, because I watch the customer tap his toes impatiently, when I could've helped him quickly and he'd be on his way."
*Everything is wireless these days.*
"And how very dare you not remember his face, even though you didn't serve him. Terrible customer service, I'm calling corporate!

You can't please everyone, and anyone who goes straight to batshit crazy, you never stood a chance to begin with."
Intentionally damaging product just to get a discount. What could go wrong....
“I also like that hat you’re wearing. How much for that?”
"You have to be really careful about what information you give customers, because it will be used against you in the court of retail."
