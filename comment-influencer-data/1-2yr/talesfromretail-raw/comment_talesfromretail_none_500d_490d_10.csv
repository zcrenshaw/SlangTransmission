You're an alteration shop?  Can you alter this gold into money for me then?
"I have an autistic child. Yeah, they can freak out if the card isn't what they were expecting,  but how is that your fault and why did you get it for him? (Just to be nice?)

Maybe the guy was autistic too (it can run it families) even if he was never diagnosed. His behavior was bizarre and he certainly had no manners. Too bad he wasn't grateful.  He should have been. You went way out of your way for him."
Why do you need to fill in a form to order a sandwich?
"If you really want to insult him, call him “Mister.”"
It makes sure the customer can't say no I didn't ask for that make me another one for free now.
My future father in law believes that the US government implants RFID chips in people’s drivers licenses to track their movements. So he put his license in the microwave for a few seconds to fry the circuitry. Now he thinks the cops are stalking him because they know they can’t track the license.
what size my dude?
"I worked at a grocery store once and 5 minutes before closing, the district managers wife comes in to do her shopping. She shops until 45 minutes past closing. When she checked out she laughed and said ""I should shop when the store is closed more often. I like shopping alone.""

That pissed me off the most about the situation. She knew when we closed, but she wanted to inconvenience everyone there anyway. It was especially frustrating because I was in high school at the time and had homework I needed to do and i could have used the 45 minutes to work on that.

Edit: wife, not wore."
You shouldn't have told her the truth. The story definitely made me chuckle :D 
"Having worked a bit of time in retail, I'm 1000% certain he asked to ride the bike specifically so he could get it dirty and try to claim a discount. I've seen far too many people with exactly the same mindset try the same sort of thing."
"Cuss-tumour didn't understand that ""tax-free day"" at the other store meant that ""THE OTHER STORE had a sale on where they discounted their merchandise by the right amount so that with tax, the total would come out to the regular pre-tax price""."
"Don't forget ""I am never shopping here again"". "
"I've seen this somewhat regularly in deli sandwich places. Fill out a form selecting your sandwich, bread type, ingredients, etc. Then they call your name when it is done. "
"""You buy gold, right?""

""No, we're an altercation shop"".

""No you're not"".

Like, how the fuck do you go to a shop, get told what they do, and then tell them they're wrong about their own shop?

Edit: I just realised I wrote ""altercation"" and not ""alteration"". Oh well, damage done."
"Haha, I don't think he was smart enough to come up with a response like that otherwise I may have considered it. "
"Actual exchange I had with a customer about ten years ago:

Customer: do you have XXXXX?

Me: no, sorry, I’m out of that right now.

C: not even in the back?

Me: no ma’am.  I don’t have it in the back either.

C: can you just check?

Me: ok.

I pull a handwritten list out of my pocket of every backstock item I had for that section, look it up and down, look back at her...

Me: nope, I *still* don’t have it.

Fuckin people man, they just don’t listen."
"Oof. He and my future grandmother in law would get along well. He could bake her ID while she shares her all-natural organic pills to detox his body of the toxic chemicals and vaccines that the government puts in the water. Hopefully your SO is worth the in-laws, good luck :)"
"I have visions of the poor produce colleague going there, taking the customer over, and then the customer waving their hand for the colleague to pick up the pack for them. Followed by ""no, not that one, find me a pack with a better date on it"" in an impatient tone..."
"Yet, he decided to give stupid answers. 

I mean questions are there for a reason. Some people don't want bag(s). I remember bagging for one customer and he didn't want the bag so he took it off and now the bag is used."
Doesn't every store have the new skynet inventory system?
"We don't have to wear underwear if our husbands are dead?

*Googles 'undetectable poisons'*"
"If they complain enough, to someone high enough, they will eventually get the ""Customer Service Discount"" because for some stupid reason, upper management seems to think that hanging on to that one really crappy customer is better than losing a really crappy customer.  This one is going to use that ""Customer Service Discount"" every single time she shops now..."
"&gt;&gt;“What part is closed at 5?”
&gt;
&gt;&gt;“the entrance” 

"
"Everytime I go to a restaurant and my stepdad is there, he doesn't read the menu and just orders.  He just assumes they have whatever he wants. 

For years I thought he was illiterate.  He isn't."
"Whenever people said they were taking their business elsewhere I always replied with, ""Sounds good. Have a nice day!"" And then I savored the look on their face. "
People like UB are one of the reasons why we can't have nice things.
“You aren’t shopping here now!”
"It’s absurd how people treat cashiers badly when they clearly aren’t the ones that make the rules. And yes, anyone who openly admits “I learned it on Facebook!” Is lacking quite a few brain cells and should not be drinking alcohol, as they are already too stupid to function. "
"Call the store manager, the district manager, and possibly the regional manager and explain that everyone on payroll that evening cost the company money for the convenience of one person, who knew exactly what she was doing."
"I don't understand why they feel like it's a threat.

 ""I'm going to make unreasonable demands for special treatment somewhere else, then!""

Thank fucking God. "
"It’s never ok for someone to call you names and treat you like that. You did the right thing by walking away, and I wish a thousand UB’s upon your pathetic snake of a manager. "
"Reminds me of when I was working in a bookstore back when the Harry Potter books were coming out.

It was a week or so after the release and there was a logistics issue which meant we ran out. So many people came in asking about it that we put the display back up, empty, with a sign that explained the situation.

One random weeknight, we're dead. Myself, another worker (both in our teens or early 20s), and our night manager, an older lady maybe in her 60s, who was totally awesome.

Well the place is empty so night manager sends my co-worker home, then goes into the back for a break and then to organize the back room. Not long after, this lady comes in, looks at our empty HP display, then comes up to me to *demand* a book.

I explain the situation but she won't hear it. She's not angry either, she's just got this patronizing smug confidence that she's going to get her way.

Finally, she says, ""Whatever you say dear. Now go into the back and don't come out until you have that book for me.""

So I go back and tell my manager what's up, and she literally says nothing, just pulls out one of the break room chairs and pats it for me to sit.

I sit down and she hands me a can of ginger ale and pushes her cheese and crackers between us to share.

Finally I ask what I should do about the lady, and she shrugs and says, ""Well she told you not to come back out till you have the book!""

We hung out back there for twenty minutes and when we came back out the lady was gone."
"I don’t make the rules, man. I just work here. "
"I don't know what makes me more upset. That he never was an officer rank and wasn't referred to as 'sir', or that he was an officer and still acted that way."
"The spiritual cousin to this is a customer opening a new box to look at the item, leaving that box, then taking an unopened one for themselves."
"Old ladies are the *worst*, honestly. Rude, impatient, urgh. Had one bark 'CHICKEN SLICES' at me, while I was refilling coleslaw yesterday. And they say youngsters are the ones without manners."
"Just want to point out before the inevitable slew of questions, said law mentioned only applies on Sundays and to stores above a certain size. But yea, Sunday Tradeing laws are a thing and have been for many many decades."
"&gt; Man: So? 

These are the same people who think if no one saw it, it didn't happen."
i wish more places did that to be honest
"I direct customers to different stores all the time if we don't sell what they're looking for. Like, I get paid by the hour, so yeah, it's not going to affect me."
"Yeah it sounds like perhaps the parent is autistic and isn't really into games so is only familiar with or comfortable with this one specific game store. 

I could understand in that situation being upset that they don't have what you need. However OP went above and beyond the call of duty (and required compensation for that) to resolve the problem. 

Sounds like something you could pull out on an interview if you ask me. "
"An alter**c**ation shop sounds like a poor business plan, plenty of people get all riled up and ready to fight for free."
"How dare you ask her to put her clothing back on OP! Don't you know that's terrible customer service, and the customer is always right? /s"
"I work with a similar situation, and have heard the same thing. But I sell furniture, so there's no way to ""take off with my entire store"". Especially not the lone man in his 70s that said it to me. "
"I personally love it when places do this. It lets me see all the choices ahead of time and think about exactly what I want without holding any other customers up. One place near me has the ""form"" printed on the bag they put your sandwich in, so you definitely get it back. That way I feel fine complaining if they mess up because it clearly shows I selected mayo and not extra mustard (instead of me thinking maybe I spoke too quietly or said the wrong word)."
"That would defeat the whole purpose of the form, which is to get the customer to commit *in writing* to what they want, so they can't make a big fuss at the end and complain that the employee made it wrong and wind up getting their sandwich for free. "
He sounds vaguely like a drug addict who's trying to sell his Mother's jewellery for more drug money
"Ugh, I hate emotionally manipulative people. I have a cousin like this, who will treat you like trash and then turn super sweet when other people show up so that you look unhinged for being mad at her. It's the absolute worst to deal with, and they feed off of getting you mad so that they can switch over to the innocence and get away with it. It's like a drug for them, and it's really hard to intercept and avoid their tricks if you don't know that the second bit of it is coming. "
"&gt; Well I don't even want the return if you aren't going to do it with a smile on your face!

Ok then, have a nice day."
"Schrodinger's curtain rod box. It is both damaged yet undamaged until the box is open, and *deserves* a discount. *Duh.*     /s"
"I can't stand when people yell products at you and then look at you like YOU'RE the stupid one for not understanding what they're saying. Or they expect you to materialize the product right in your hands and give it to them. The other day I had a lady ask me where charcoal was.


""Charcoal!""

""I'm sorry?""

""CHAR-COAL. What aisle?""
  
Like, I'm sorry, adults usually speak in full sentences and hearing you attempt to communicate like a toddler confused me for a second."
"I think it makes the line move faster. No hemming and hawing over ""hmm ummm yeah let me get... ummm.. yeahh... oh, onions, and lettuce and uhh... hmm.."" 

You take the time to make the decisions on paper. Write extra/less. Go pay your check while your food is being made. The guy making your sandwich knows where the ingredients are and can crank things out quickly. Boom. "
"Except she then calls up the store freaking out that they hired a murderer that eats babies, which is awful because she felt her life was in danger. And that's bad customer service because she, as a customer, shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable in any way. And how dare they put their customers at risk like that? And she's never shopping there again. And they should fire OP because criminals shouldn't have jobs at places she frequents. OP could have robbed her, you know? And then the manager gets angry because (at least from this sub) most managers just cave into the customers instead of standing up for themselves, and lack any sense of humor whatsoever. "
It's people like these that make me realize trapdoors into alligator pits have practical uses outside of cartoons........
