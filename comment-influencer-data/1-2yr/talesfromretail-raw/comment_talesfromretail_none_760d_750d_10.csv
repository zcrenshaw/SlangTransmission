"&gt; ""I'm not a mind reader you know? I wish I was"" he didn't even respond to this.

Maybe he was *thinking* a witty response as a test to see whether you were lying."
"&gt; ""Do you have any more of _____?""

""No, ma'am, not until tomorrow morning.""

&gt; ""Can you check in the back?""

Pull small list of entire back inventory out of pocket, show it to customer.  ""I just made this list five minutes ago of everything that is in my back room.  I don't have it.""

&gt; ""Well, can you just check?""

""OK."" Look at my list, look back at her. ""No, I still don't have it.""


This actually fucking happened to me, as verbatim as I can recall.  Fuck retail."
"Yeah, there are people like this.  There are also people who buy completely identical outfits so they wear the same thing every day, because they hate picking out clothes to wear every day.  A former boss of mine wore the same $2000 suit to work, day in, day out.  (They were definitely different outfits.  I saw one get soiled in a lunch accident, and the next day, same outfit, completely clean.)"
"You are truly an angel in disguise.  My kid is 14 months old and we generally don't take him out shopping for this reason.  Luckily he was sick only once since his birth but when the little guys do catch something like Norovirus there is no warning, they become walking projectile machines."
"If I realized I'd managed that level of bonehead, I'd have gotten the tray from a different store."
"If you don't know how to use a self-checkout, why do it?  Dumbass. "
"I wish I could play Train Noises 2, 1 was a masterpiece."
"I'm always so amazed at how wanton people are about getting others fired. Like really, you want to (potentially) fuck up someone's life because of how you percieved a social interaction? What a horrible person."
The ending made me feel good. 16 y/o me would've probably burst out crying. 
Aliens are among us...
You have to wonder how some of these kids cope with parents like that...
"&gt; We usually managed to understand what they wanted, but they didn’t always understand what we were trying to tell them…

Worked in a town near a Spanish speaking country, lots of Spanish only speakers would speak to my regrettably only English speaking self.

I knew what they want, it's amazing how much words don't matter most of the time. But i still had to find a Spanish speaking coworker to tell them that ""No, you can only get the free phone deal if you weren't already a customer at &lt;cell phone company&gt;"" Since that's hard enough to explain to fellow English only speakers complete with sock puppets."
LOL! 
I'm one of those people haha. I have 8 pairs of the same work pants and 4 work shirts in white and 4 in black. Makes it easy when you dont have to think about what to wear since everything is the same.
"Love that she returned, after learning the hard way, instead of just listening to you."
"Atleast the husband was sensable and made them hurry up and leave, you couldve been there much longer. "
"I see no problem here. Sometimes people need to be taken down a peg. 

It can backfire on you though. Proceed with caution."
She had the audacity to say you where being rude...damn!
"Am I the only one that was humming the title to ""What is love?""?

What is food ^^food

Baby don't eat me ^^me

Don't eat me ^^me

No mo' ^^o-^^o-^^o"
"Shoes are the worst! I work in the same area where all the stolen/missing/damaged/expired items go and I recently got a box of shoes... the problem? The shoes in the box were old, and worn out, dirty and were a brand we do not, and never did, carry. The shoes that were supposed to be in the box were nowhere to be found.

I don't even know what to do about it. I mean what the hell is wrong with people. They weren't even expensive shoes! 

To be fair I'd rather be the one receiving the stolen shoes than dealing with the customer stealing them. Shoe people are nuts."
Welcome to the machine. May I direct you to your cog?
"Well, it's very considerate of her to go tell everyone she meets that she's an idiot and needs to be babysat, I guess."
"Hmm, if only there were some way he could have told Bob. Is Tim an invertebrate?"
"I'll usually say something to the effect of ""I was just in the back and we don't have it. I can take a look if you want, but it'll really be a waste of both of our time.""

If they really insist I check the back, I have no problem going back and meticulously checking the label on every box in every corner of the back room, and then coming right back out and telling them that I was correct and it's not back there. 

I learned pretty quickly that some people just won't be happy until you just go through the motions for them. Some people appreciate you saving them time by just being straight up with them (""ma'am, I'm sorry, I'm very confident this won't fit into your car"" or ""no, I've been working on emptying the back today and I know we don't have that back there"" or ""I unboxed those myself yesterday, I'm positive they're not on sale yet""). Other people just assume you're being lazy and making an excuse. For those people, I do not mind one bit if they want me to waste more of their time. I'm stuck in this store until my shift is done one way or the other; they're the one who has somewhere to be."
16 year old me would have been fired for screaming back. I went through a lot of jobs in my teens ha.
"Sometimes, I swear gift cards are an invention of Satan.... People seem to have so much trouble checking the balance and get so insanely angry when they're wrong.... And what the heck did he mean about the effort? Were you just supposed to give it to him because that would be easier? "
"*""you don't need to be so rude"".*

Neither do you, but since you were, I felt perfectly justified."
"Moral of the story, commit one crime at a time."
"*AL: But I am from Arkansas.*

I'm so sorry. The main thing is that you managed to escape!"
Because some stores that stay open late or 24 hours leave only the self-checkouts open after a certain time.
"Thank you, that means a lot :) I think she was a single mother as well, so I can't even imagine the stress she was under trying to look after two young kids while also being pregnant."
"&gt; LC: Were you trying to check me out?

Ma'am, I'd advise you stop there or your head may not fit through our door"
The daughter is dead inside from dealing with her mom for sure
Pretty sure there are a couple subs that deal with having narcissistic parents. This lady has got to be incredibly self centered to act this way.
"Embarrassment is a trait that goes hand in hand with intelligence, something this client apparently lacked. 

We should be happy to hear they learned something new today!"
Awesome customers! More people should be like those girls!
"I've always loved these types of exchanges! There's something nice about trying to work together to communicate across a language barrier

A great one happened to me when I was young and working in a shop near the Gaeltacht (Irish speaking areas of Ireland- everyone can speak English but Irish is spoken as well). A group of tourists came in and one of them says something incomprehensible to me. I look confused and express that. She repeats the same thing. Still nothing, so I say 'Sorry?' She slowly says the same sentence and without a reaction again, pulls out a translation book for Spanish to Irish and points at 'vino.' Realizing she was attempting to speak Irish, having taken Spanish in secondary and remembering none of my Irish, I say in Spanish that I speak a bit. I help them find what they need, speaking Spanish and struggling through the whole time. As they're leaving, I respond to a colleague's question in English. The tourist hears this and excitedly says in perfect English, 'Oh! You speak English! I actually had a few questions and was hoping to find someone to help!' They were Spaniards living in England and were under the impression no one in the area spoke English. We have a laugh on it and I help them with directions and recommendations, this time in English

TLDR: Spaniards living in England thought the Gaeltacht was Irish-only and tried to speak Irish to me, a non-speaker, so we had to struggle through a conversation in broken Spanish"
I'd like to know what planet she's from where they have sharpeners for liquid liner!
"At least she knows where she's from. Hopefully, that means she can find her way back......"
"That's so sweet. You must have made her day, week, month!"
"Did he think it was some sort of in store conspiracy, and he had to find someone who was willing to risk telling him the truth about Oatgate?"
"Someone was rattling the door at my work the other day (we were closed) and when I looked over they made a huge, overexaggerated shrug and face like ""what gives?"" I could help myself, I made the same exaggerated shrug back with an ""oh well"" face and went back to cleaning out of sight. 

The guy was just so rude, I was just automatically rude back. Thankfully no one was around to get me in trouble "
"&gt;After a brief bluescreen moment, my brain started up again

I LOVE THAT!"
Every single character in this story except you is a complete idiot.
"Its been scientifically proven that you can only effectively make so many decisions in a day.

What to wear is a waste of a decision. 

Zuckerberg wears the same thing everyday for this exact reason (barring the odd suit for really important things) and look how much money he makes"
"Here, underpaid person, let me bully you to make you polite! "
"I had a guy argue with me for the better part of ten minutes that he could use a wood drill bit on anything. I informed him that he was, indeed, not wrong, just that it'll kill the bit quicker. Use it on concrete and it will dull it faster, use it on steel after and it might jam/break off. He basically told me to pound sand; wood bit is cheaper...aaaaaand I saw him later that day sneak in and buy a masonry drill bit. He almost made it...but I'd switched to the register at that point and had to ring him out.

Smiled the whole time."
"As someone who has eaten dozens of cake slices served on their sides, I can certify that they are just as delicious. Actually, I prefer them on their sides so that I can get a forkful of just cake or of just frosting if I want. Although this lady would probably think I'm a horrible deviant for my crimes against cake......"
"He's just staring at you intently for a few seconds, so you stare back, and suddenly say ""Aha, sorry bud but you wont catch me like that"" 

Then both of you turn white, him because you've read his mind and you because your secret is revealed.

"It's only a waste if you don't actually enjoy or value the process in any way. 

For people like Mark Zuckerberg or even designers like Michael Kors, they don't put any value on what they look like so much as what the energy they put into their paid work but for other people who do enjoy that creative process, it's an endeavor worth putting energy toward.  When you don't get to work in a creative job and you're not the crafting type, the creativity just gets channeled elsewhere and I think it's pretty cool."
"I would've looked at the clock and said, ""No, it's 7:15"""
"For a minute there, I thought she was literally making train noises, followed by a 2. That would have been hilarious. "
Retail stores need some kind of silent screaming therapy room out back for employees.
"""Grandma, why are you and your siblings all blind?""

""Because my mom wanted us to see the 2017 solar eclipse, but didn't buy glasses before they sold out. So she made us stare at the sun to spite some retail employee."""
Is Train Noises 2 the one that came with a whistle so you could make train noises too?
Maybe she doesn't recognize what's edible. Damn lizard people
"This is a common tactic, he will keep stealing small items but ""accidently"" paying too much so you will look forward to him coming in and turn a blind eye to what he pockets knowing you will come out ahead anyway. One day, you notice your kidney is missing."
Likely you won't hear anything. She probably knew it was expired before she ever set foot in the store.
"My spouse used to be like that. She had no comprehension that walking into a restaurant 10 minutes before they close was in any way rude or improper.

She still doesn't understand why, but she knows that the kid and I will judge her harshly for such behavior. "
