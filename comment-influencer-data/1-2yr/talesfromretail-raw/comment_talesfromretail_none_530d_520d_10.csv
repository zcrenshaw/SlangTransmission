"I've had a customer like this before. They wanted to pay their tax rate from the city they live in. Flat out said that's absurd, how did you get here? He said he drove. Well looks like you're paying tax since you drove on my cities infrastructure."
"This is not a bank.  It is legal tender, you get what you get."
"&gt; Oh, you think that's really funny don't you?!

Yes, yes I do. God bless you, John."
"Paging the burn unit to the bakery stand. Burn unit to the bakery stand, we have a customer in need of assistance. "
"Years ago, I gave a customer a $5 that had a corner missing. He actually wrinkled his nose and said ""I'm not taking that."" The drawer was closed and my company has a very strict ""once it's closed, it stays closed"" policy. Finally had to call a manager who looked at the bill and said to the customer ""Take it to the bank and exchange it."" and walked away. My hero from then on."
She will be so confused when she learns of the quarter horse
“Please don’t breathe until you’re done bagging my shirts.  It might distract you and I could end up with four in a bag instead of three.”
"How much of a piece of human garbage do you have to be to do this, let alone with a 1.99$ chocolate rabbit? "
You brave soul. The audacity of this man.. seriously
Customers are actual toddlers
I hope you phoned the police afterwards. Threats are bad.
It's like the lady at my work who complained the belt was wet. What was it wet from? Her frozen food which had condensation on it which normally happens when frozen stuff is out of the freezer for some time. But she was disgusted and wanted us to wipe the package and the belt off right this second. 
"You didn't eff up.
You did the exact right thing by not giving the correct name. "
"I had something similar during tax-free weekend.  He bought 1 or 2 shirts and tried to return them during the next week and wanted me to refund him the tax (that he didn't pay).

His argument was that since he wasn't returning DURING tax-free weekend that he should get the tax refunded as well.  Not how that works!"
Yea we did gave them security footage of the guy but never heard about it again 
"Willy Wonka voice: 'No. Stop. Don't leave.

Smh. The trash took itself out on that one."
John was truly my favorite person that week.
"Oh it happens. 

I made a sub for a person once when I worked at the supermarket deli. They proceeded to eat everything but maybe 1-2 bites. Went up front to the courtesy desk and they refunded them cause they said it tasted funny. Big whopping 7 bucks too. It tasted funny, huh? AND you DIDNT notice this until you ate like 95% of it?? RIGHT......."
"I once accepted a slightly burned dollar bill at my register. It wasn't in awful shape, and definitely still usable. Unfortunately, a guy came to my register a few minutes later and was not pleased when I handed that bill to him with his change.
""Are you really going to give that to me,"" he asked in the rudest tone.
I made some comment about how it still works, trying not to be rude right back, because I've already closed the register and there is now a line behind the guy. When I see that the guy is not going to just walk away, I decide to just open the drawer and give him a different dollar (our registers allow us to open them without a transaction, but we have to keep a record of why).
After he left, the customer behind him just shook his head and told me that guy was being ridiculous.  I just shrugged. Difficult customers are the norm, after all. That guy was using a credit card, but the following customer used cash, and as I was getting his change I intentionally skipped the burned dollar, figuring I'd just put it into the bank deposit and the bank could do whatever they do with damaged bills. This guy had also seen the first customer, and said to me that he'd take the burned dollar.
It really wasn't that badly damaged. I always appreciate the customers who either stand up for us and say what we aren't allowed to, or commiserate with bus after the fact."
"""Quarter Dollar"", ""One Dime"", ""Five Cents"", ""One Cent"".

I know how money works but if you'd never seen coins before I'm pretty sure a dime would be the most confusing.

Edit: Since others are still commenting, those words I listed are the words on the coins for a quarter, a dime, a nickel, and a penny. Look at your pocket change and you'll be surprised."
"Well, he *almost* became one of those customers, but he realized his mistake just in time."
"Dude, are you kidding me?  Skin the same color as salted caramel is *gorgeous!*  That old bitch was just jealous because anytime she'd try to get skin that color, she'd end up looking like a rotten Slim Jim snack.

Don't you *ever* let me catch you being down on your gorgeous skin again, you hear me?"
Does your store charge for bags? When customers asked me for multiple bags I liked to charge them for every single one. It was the little petty things that kept me sane in retail. 
Well the OP did say something about the customer being older. You know how some of them get about whites and colors mixing.
"I can do you one even better: I work customer service at a place that kisses our customers asses no matter what. A woman came to the desk with a big tub of protein powder, says ""I need to return this."" Nothing else (normally they offer up some sort of explanation, which we really don't need at my store so I didn't ask, but it was just different). 

I start to process the return, then I notice that the tub feels very light. I open it up as it's processing, right in front of the lady, and see that there are *maybe* two scoops left of powder in this gigantic container. I look at the lady, she looks back unflinchingly at me, and the return is processed. $89. If I would have said anything to her, or god forbid implied I couldn't do the return, I would have been definitely coached, maybe fired. This was months ago and I'm still fuming about it. "
"At that point, I suppose you just have to say, ""Not my policy, not my loss."" It's the business that's being a chump. "
She probably hung up &amp; left when she realized the cops were going to arrest her for stupidity.
"I guess I was that customer recently. 

Like Very high end designer wallet belonging to my wife. Credit card slots started delaminating (very clear factory defect) so I brought it in for warranty.  Honestly expected them to replace it but their policy is repair.

6 weeks later I return to pick it up. 

Wallet is in exactly the same condition it left in.  As in it looks like it just sat in their back room for 6 weeks then they called me to pick it up. 

Sales consultant tries to convince me it actually has been repaired. Points to edges saying how they have opened it up and restitched it and redone the edging. 

I look at the wallet. Card slots are still delaminated. No signs of even an attempt at repair. Stitching still has signs of wear on it. Edging has signs of wear on it. He is clearly lying to me. 

I tell him that it’s completely unacceptable that it has been returned in this condition after 6 weeks waiting for repair. He tells me if for some reason I’m not satisfied with the quality of the repair work all they can do is send it away for another 6 weeks to try again. I argue that clearly that didn’t work the first time and how am I to expect that it’s not going to return another 6 weeks later looking exactly the same since clearly their QA department is blind.

Apparently there is nobody else who can help me. There is no way to contact the repair center to figure out how they managed to spend 6 weeks doing absolutely nothing to the item. There is no phone number for them. Nobody has the phone number. There is no recourse. There are no supervisors or corporate resources that could find some resolution to this.  Nothing.  

I wouldn’t have been pissed except for him repeatedly trying to convince me that the repair had actually been done and that I should just accept the repair. 

Eventually I just give up arguing with him and leave it with the store to ship to repair. 

When I get home I call up corporate customer service. They hear what happened and issue an immediate replacement order. They tell me to pick up the old item from the store and mail it back. When I pick it up the salesman is absolutely flabbergasted that a replacement is being sent. Absolutely amazed that I managed to contact someone. Wants to know the magic number I called to get a customer service agent that could work such miracles. It was 1-888-(brand name). 

Edit: We know it was a factory defect with the glue because the first wallet distinctly smelt like ass. Horrible odor. The second one smelt like it was expensive. Definite difference. "
"&gt; this is infringing his rights

You: *pulls out a copy of the Constitution and penal code*

Which legal right would that be, sir?"
"Had something similar happen with a customer that bought a large projection TV.  We marked them way down to get rid of them since the new flat screens were dropping in price and the projections weren't selling anymore.  This idiot bought the last big one we had that was originally a couple of grand for about 600 or so.  

We brought it out to his vehicle to load it, and discovered his pickup had no tailgate.  He had no tie down straps, and he didnt want to tie it down with the twine he had.  He said it would be fine, he only lived a few miles away.  Most projection TVs usually have wheels to make it easier to move them around, and this one did.  I tried to explain to the cus-dumber how physics works, but he basically told me to go fuck myself.  I sure made to remind him that: 

1. We are not responsible for damaged items resulting from his negligence.  It was on wheels and would roll.

2.  It is a clearance item, you know it works, we plugged it in and showed him, and that it non-refundable.

3.  We offered him solutions to secure his item and he refused them.

Well about 20 minutes later we get a call from the irate idiot because, surprise! it fell out of the back of his truck.  Not only that, it was hit by a large semi behind him and smashed into a million pieces.  He got cited by the PD for several violations for causing the accident, and not securing his load properly.  He wanted us to pay his fines as well as give a refund.

I told him everything I told him before, and politely told him to piss off.  He threatened to sue us.   As soon as he said those magic words, I told him that I was no longer allowed to speak with him on the matter, since there was pending litigation, have a nice day and I hung up.  I never heard anything further about it.     

"
Yea the amount of times I was threatened there was ridiculous I started to look forward to it so I could close early and get paid for the whole day
Reminds me of the people who request that I give them a “nice” looking bill in return.....ugh 
"""The humidity from your breath is going to shrink the shirt. I want a new one from the back room."""
"Lol! I always tell the people I’m training that customers are toddlers and our job is to try and keep them from killing themselves. If there is a ladder left on the floor, they will climb on it and eventually fall and get hurt. If something is spilled on the floor the don’t avoid it they walk straight thru it and will slip and fall. If a loaf of bread falls off the shelf they will repeatedly roll their cart over it until it’s crumbs all over the floor and then they will slip on that.  

Don’t get me started on the people in the electric carts who run into EVERYTHING. "
Maybe they had work-fried brains? I know I got that way sometimes.
"I'm towards the end of my retail tenure so I just wear the wrong name tag. My boss knows and doesn't really care but any day I could be John, Chris, Bob, Joe, Mac, etc."
"Oh god. Tax free weekend. *shudders*

When I was at [office supply store] in Ohio, tax free weekend didn't apply to techonology. I got in so many effing arguments with customers over it. Like, look people, I don't make the rules. I just enforce them. Abusing me isn't going to help you. "
"Tends to be the case, generally. Even though it's illegal to threaten people, people who do it just get away with it."
"If she could afford to leave the $5 without taking anything, then she definitely could have afforded $4 for the unbroken candles. It sounds like she's just a cheap person who thinks anything goes so long as it saves her money."

"Are, are you me? Because I had that same thing happen to me today only with dish soap. I hope the lady enjoys her yogurt foods as much as mine enjoyed her soapy asparagus. "
I'm sorry...why couldn't the coloured clothes go in the same bag as the white ones? It's a plastic bag not a washing machine!
"I think I wanna punch her in the face. That's like making a cake from scratch (i.e., not using a Pillsbury mix) and having someone bitch at you because ""Do you own the chickens that laid the eggs? Did you mill the flour yourself? Did you personally harvest the cocoa beans?"" "
"The title had me preparing for some jerk yelling at you for not providing gift wrapping, and I'm pleasantly surprised that it's not the case at all. It was awesome of you to help him out, and I'm glad he appreciated it!"
If reincarnation is real I hope she comes back as a sea turtle that chokes on a plastic bag. 
I'm mostly in awe that a grown man had 30 minutes to spare to eat a full-sized chocolate bunny while still in the store.
I can only imagine how happy you were when you told her that...puuuuure bliss right there
