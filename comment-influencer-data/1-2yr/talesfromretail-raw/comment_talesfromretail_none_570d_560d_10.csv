Wait. Lemme get this right. Corporate gave that customer who nearly peed in the store and nearly punched a manager a $20 gift card?! Has the manager told them their side of the story? 
"Yeah, she's a good customer. Don't you know thieves are the best customers? Also I'm not condoning thievery but why be so dumb about it? She could have switched it with a tag that was say, $5 or so. But a few cents? "
I had a guy once try to pass a length of rebar in a taped-up dimes wrapper as five bucks. It was the right size and all...but it didn't break open when I tried to count it.
"I know all about your conspiracy OP. I know you order all the online exclusive clothing into the store, and you stick it all in the magical 'back room' and then you sit back there, wearing your ill gotten goods, watching the customers through hidden cameras and laughing that they'll never have all the wonderful exclusive clothing, and that your evil plan has finally succeeded. TODAY THE ONLINE EXCLUSIVES, TOMORROW THE WORLD!"
"Yeah, she did, along with the greeter and myself. They didn't care. That's just how corporate was for us. A lot more happened while I worked at that store, that was just the worst and most memorable. "
You shouldn’t apologize for treating others the way they treated you 
"Who on earth would even think they could return a bunch of used flip flops?  I could maybe understand if they were never worn or something, but they were actually purchased for and used for their intended purpose, how does that merit a refund? I wish your boss had more of a spine and told her no way would she refund those shoes! (and letting the guests keep them seems like a great idea).  Like you said, she didn't make much back considering how much she spent.  I wouldn't want a flip flop worn by someone else--what if they had foot fungus or something? Gross!"
Whoa whoa. Are you trying to tell me that not every store is a super center?! Why don't you just close!
I wonder why she thought limes were vegetables.
Man I love it when bosses tell off customers.

"Limes are green, like vegetables. "
"As a grocery store worker, 90% of my job is just reading the packaging to the customer because they are too lazy to look themselves.

Don't ya love people? ;P"
"I mean at least he tried to make it seem legit. It makes me wonder how people think up plans like this. Of course, we are going to check the roll! xD"
"According to customers, our back room is a never ending room that goes on forever and automatically contains everything we've ever sold "
"If he got to the ER within 2-4 hours (which it sounds like he did) he very likely made it out OK. If he got there under 2 hours any severe damage to his liver was limited, although it depends on how much he ingested. My point is that he likely left the hospital in a few days without permanent damage, after getting inpatient therapy/treatment for the suicide attempt, after which he hopefully regularly saw the referred psychiatrist to manage his PTSD. You were probably his first link in a chain of people helping him get the therapy he needed."
A couple weeks ago I had a guy try to pay with a king size Reese's. He was mad that we couldn't break his $100 (store policy) and the business next door makes you purchase something to break large bills. So he had bought the candy and wanted me to accept that as part of his payment. At first I thought he was joking but he was dead serious. I had to repeat a few times to him that as much as I would love that candy it is not an accepted form of currency here.. 
How does she plan on calling thevpolicw without her cell phone? 
"I did too. The thing was, she was super nice and she always stood up for us. She ended up getting let go later after another incident that I only heard about, I wasn't there. She was really pregnant at the time like 7-9 months and i guess another customer got upset at her for whatever reason and threw a 12 pack at her stomach and when it hit her foot he went up in her face and she pulled her knife out. She didn't do anything to him, but that was on camera and other customers only saw that again and called corporate and she went on maternity leave and didn't come back :(. She's happier now where she works though, and she deserves it. "
"*No fair, you changed the outcome by measuring it!*"
"Thing was, I didn’t mean to snap off back at her but it just kinda peeved me that she was jumping on my case when I was already in the back helping people. But when I opened my mouth, it came spilling out. Not one of my finest moments."
"Vodka is clear, like water."
"Those sneaky prepositions, modifying the relationship between a verb and noun."
Some days we win
And to take it further and get aggressive with the cashier because it didn't work... Just wow

"I worked in a restaurant where you could get a “water” cup, and people would put sprite in it, like we couldn’t tell. 

My boss would ask them to pay, and if they didn’t he would call the cops. Every time. It was so amazing. I miss that boss so much. "
"Dang, dude. Sorry you had to experience that at 17. Are you ok? "
"I’m pretty sure she just felt like she was gaining ground quickly by making my coworker super nervous, like she would just accept it as 20 cents and move on, and so she kept pushing it."
You should ask for her phone number to verify that the cell phone is hers when she comes to pick it up. 
"All our tags have the name of the item on them for this reason.

Doesn't stop people though. Oh but it was behind that tag, yeah well that tag says it's for a different item so suck it up.

Actually had one woman proudly announce she couldn't read so it didn't count."
"Goddammit, Courtney. "
Exactly what I thought. She's probably going to show up at a station accusing us of stealing her phone. Luckily we have cameras that will show her leaving it on the counter and my coworker running out the door to catch her. 
"Used to have a customer do this at my store all the time. Last time she came in and i was the manager on duty, saw her walk in, saw what she was buying and as she walked up to the register i went to the shelf and switched the tags back to normal. When they paged me to the front to help her because “the price on the shelf was much lower” i gladly walked her back to show her that, in fact, the register was correct. She tried to tell me that the price wasn’t like that a minute ago... i said “oh maybe someone accidentally changed the price, let me go check the cameras really quick to double check for you” in my most sickeningly sweet voice ever. She promptly conceded and left. Oh, and there were also never any cameras. "
When all was said and done they probably only saved like five or ten dollars.
Don't let his bad attitude make you forget that you did a good thing. 
I was more worried about the guy than myself and no one spoke to me until he was in the ambulence to tell me what happened and to keep working. I just sort of moved the stuff off the belt in a bit of a shock and went to the next customer... Thinking back now I was completely out of it the rest of the shift. 
At least you got rid if her! LOL
"I once had a grown-ass woman ask me if frogs were animals. Since the alternatives are plants, fungi , or bacteria, I told her I didn't know which one frogs were."
"Up until the past couple of days (we just got all new stock in) anytime someone purchased a pair of black flip flops, I got a little tiny sick to my stomach..."
"&gt;I spent a lot of money on this

.

&gt;$7.55

Hmm...."
"I’m sorry I may be reading this wrong, but did you resell the used used flip flops??"
"I would have gotten his license plate number and called the cops, or at least I'd like to think I would. I don't know, I haven't had to deal with assault at work before.

But I'm glad you pulled a Dubya with the second throw. "
...and then there are the other 364
