"""Sure, my name is Crashy McFenderbender and this is my coworker, Otto Fatality! Good night and drive safe!"""
"""Corporate will hear about this!!!"""
"Obviously the important thing isn’t getting the best price; it’s *using the coupon*.

File under “unclear on the concept.”"
2 dollars... Their brains must still be in the old days.
"Well now that you know how the manager can respond just reply to every out of policy issue with “I can’t accommodate your request, but perhaps my manager can”

Then call him over for every single out of policy request. "
"Aw, poor guy, but he sounds like *just* the customer you needed that day. "
"People don’t understand that the fines are huge if you are selling to a minor.  I wouldn’t risk my job either. 

I work in retail support and if a customer asks me for cigarettes when I am behind the counter I politely inform them that I do not work here and I cannot hand you this stuff.  I will only do so if the cashier or manager asks me to.  I am still apprehensive about doing that."
Apparently there were enough complaints about the store being closed for a day that we were instructed to give 25% off coupons to any customers who came in upset about it.
Lol “the manager says you can do that” which manager and when lady
"""I heard there was supposed to be a blowout sale here that day!""

""No, ma'am...if there had been a blowout, we'd be having a fire sale."""
Maybe he had just robbed somewhere else and was trying to get rid of it quickly by buying big ticket items?
"So she didn't have time for the coupon, but she had time to stop and complain about you. "
And that's why I no longer play certain card collectible game which name rhymes with agic.
Good on your manager for sticking to the rules! 
"Sometimes I’d be super passive aggressive with people like that. I have a naturally loud voice that I have to remember to modulate, or I tend to bellow in noisy environments. So when I got phone talkers, I’d **chatter** - and at full volume. 

Talk on the phone at my register? Ok. I’ll talk your ear off, at too-loud crazy-lady volume."
My guess... drug dealer didn’t want to use his drug money on camera. 
"In Canada we have a chain store, Canadian Tire, that gives out small rebate coupons with every purchase. They look and feel like real currency, it's called Canadian Tire Money, and I'm sure every single Canadian has some. Problem is they come in denominations of 5 cents, 10 cents, etc.

I have stacks and stacks of this stuff at home. I'm told by the store staff that if I come in when it's not busy, they'll count it out for me and put the value on a gift card. But I dread the day I walk in there with a huge pile.
"
"Oh my god I love you. ALL REJOICE, WE HAVE BEEN SENT THE VOICE WE NEEDED"
I pulled over to help a turtle cross the road and when I got out of my car a truck hit it ;_;
"Ah, the old days. When video games cost two dollars.

Wait. Video games never cost two dollars!"
"I like to just carry on as normal when people stay on their phones at the register, asking all the questions we're supposed to ask. 

""How are you today?""
""Would you like gift receipts with these?""
""Would you like to sign up to receive our promotions through email?""
""Would you like a bag?""
""How will you be paying today?""
""Would you like the receipt in the bag?""

By the end they're more annoyed at me than I am at them. It's glorious. "
Flowers aren't even an ideal gift for someone going through cancer treatment... Too much infection risk
"A 19 year old kid worked with me for about a year and a half, until recently. First few months he came in as a normal, sweet, cool kid. Then he started getting pain in his shoulder. Shortly after he found out he had a rare form of cancer. He started going to weekly chemo sessions, days long hospital visits, other procedures, etc. Lost his hair, lost weight, etc. Completely changed appearance. The whole time he continued working the days that he could because he said we helped him get his mind off of things. We were like family to him, and he was to us.
About a month and a half ago he had his final chemo treatment. We threw a celebration for him at work. It was the end of a long journey. 
About two weeks after that, SLED came through his line and he didn't check ID. Got a $350 fine, a court date, and was fired the next day. "
"I got lost in the grocery. And older lady had the same jacket as my oma (grandma). I hugged her, said something about being scared. Then i saw her face and started crying. This kind lady left her cart and started looking for oma with me. She had me take her to aisle i thought i last saw her. Went from aisle to aisle. Until we found her. 

My oma was looking for me to thinking i couldn't have been that far away. She thought i was still with my dad. I had left him to find her and walk with her. The nice lady told my grandma she would have stayed with me until we found oma. She said she reminds me of my grand child. Oma and the lady talked. I don't remember what was said. I just hugged my oma. Then they hugged. "
"It’s amazing the amount of people who don’t have their ID on them. I worked at a pharmacy that also had a drive-thru and with controlled substance prescriptions we need a valid ID. People in the drive thru would get so mad at us for not giving them their script if they didn’t have their drivers license on them, but seriously, why are you driving without one?!"
She definitely stole something.
There's *always* time to complain!
That is almost genius. Minus wearing the same outfit you robbed the other store in.
Otto Fatality. Instant classic.
"I'm wandering a store, filling my basket with clearance items and I head to the register line. This store has the line that snakes around shelves of impulse items, you move to the front and then wait to be called. I'm the only person in the line save for what I think is an abandoned completely full cart. I walk up, there is not one person nearby so I assume that someone changed their mind and left the cart. I walk around the cart and stand in the line to pay. ""EXCUSE ME. THAT'S MY SPOT"" I turn around and there's an older lady carrying something that she dumps in the cart. I say ""Oh, I didn't know anyone was here"" which was the truth and then step back. It would have ended there except..............the lady then turns, looks at me *AND FROWNS AT ME.*.... Oh, really? So, you're giving me attitude? ""Actually, Ma'am, **YOU** were NOT in line, YOU were still shopping, your abandoned cart was in line. There's a difference."" She snapped at me calling me rude, I told her she was inconsiderate to block a line while continuing to shop. Sorry clerks, if she'd just kept her attitude to herself I'd have remained silent but (shrug). "
"This entirely. If he wants to be a pushover, don't even waste your time anymore. Whatever you get paid is not worth it.

""Yes, I'd like to return this. It's covered in blood and I bought it a year ago with a gift card and I want cash back.""
""Please hold. I'll get a manager. I can't do returns past two weeks."""
"I feel you on this one. I have always been quite strong for my size and often surprised people with how heavy stuff I can carry. But lately due to a virus infection my strength has just evaporated. I can barely hold my arms up for even 30 sec some days. Yet I am expected to do the same heavy lifting as usual, even though I have told my managers how much it hurts. Some people just won't listen.. "
"""What a happy coincidence! We're currently having a special on wheelbarrows."""
"I would have just ""suggested"" that she can't drive around at night without headlights as I was very obviously writing down her license plate, just to piss her off even more. It's petty but I bet it feels good lol"
I’ve literally watched someone lose their job and be asked to leave immediately for not carding a minor. It only takes once.
"I mean, at least I have that. But I don't think I'm dumb as a rock. Maybe a stump, but definitely not a rock.
"
"Sadly, we’ve been having incidents where people are doing this (and not getting caught), so the manager was already pretty fed up.   
"
Hope whatever started your day by turning you into a crying mess was resolved. Sorry you had to start your shift that way.
"Since you were clocked out, it seems like no good could come of giving her your names. All that did was open yourself up to getting talked to by corporate in the event that she calls them to complain."
Tragic
"See, I never mind when people are on the phone at my register. It's not like I want to make small talk anyway. But if they want anything extra like a bag or a receipt, they better speak up, because I'm not saying a single word during the transaction"
"I really want to know how many complaints I got lately, since I decided to stand up for myself a lot lately"
"Old people are the worst when buying games. Everything is a ""Nintendo"" (I once heard ""Nintendo PlayStation"" then the daughter of the woman said, ""He's got an XBox""), they want to spend $10 at the most, they have no idea what their grandkid wants so just say ""What is your recommendation?"", they're the most impatient, rude, etc.

Sorry I can't really give a recommendation when you don't know what system your grandkid has, you refuse to tell me their age (""you don't need to know that, just tell me what game they would like""), you have no idea what genres they're into, you don't know what games they already have and you want it under $10. Just get them a fucking giftcard if you're gonna be that stupid.

Like I get that it's overwhelming so have *some* info for me so I can help you or, again, just buy a giftcard and let them pick out their own game! They get so mad when you don't magically know what their grandkid would like though. And old people are just the worst for not having any info and getting mad at you for it. Not just with video games but with *everything*. ""I'm looking for a belt for my vacuum."" ""Okay here are the belts. What vacuum do you have?"" ""I don't know. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT BELT I NEED?!"""
"At least they thought you were cute. That's something, maybe. "
"My husband use to go to a card tournament this very nice woman hosted. She rented a room in a building down town, provided chairs and tables and bought food. Then after a while a couple of dudes just like this came in and were constantly lying and throwing tantrums and ruining the experience for everyone else. She announced after the dozenth time they screwed the games up that she wouldn’t be hosting anymore games. It’s a shame when sore losers do stuff like this."
