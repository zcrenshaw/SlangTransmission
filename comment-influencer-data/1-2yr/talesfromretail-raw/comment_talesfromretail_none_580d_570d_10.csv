"&gt;""Yes I want this broken radio""

&gt;""wtf why is this radio broken"""
"I love catty arguments at the checkouts. Once served a bickering old couple. The man shut up the lady when he snapped “this is why we’re just friends with benefits.” 

I died. "
She drove 4 hours to go drinking? I hope she was planning on getting a hotel. 
"I had a girl in my class in secondary school with a prosthetic ear, she used to take it off, put it on her forehead and say ""star trek... the final front ear"""
"There was a couple years ago that came to check out and the lady was in this huge hurry.  Her husband looked at her and exclaimed ""where the hell do we have to be, we're retired?!"".  We all got a good chuckle out of that one."
More to the point who bothers to spend $120 on a hat for a kid? They’ll grow out of it in a few months. 
Many years ago I was stopped by a customer to answer a question.  They completely ignored the blood soaked paper towel wrapped around my hand and continued to ask questions while blood ran down my arm. During this entire conversation my hand was elevated and level with my face.
"That last line absolutely made this story.

You killed it."
"Ooh I have a little anecdote like this. 

I'm ringing up a couple and I ask if they have our rewards card. We have the little key chain one. The husband pulls out the keys and throws them across the counter at me. 

Wife: don't throw the keys at her!

The husband just looks at her. 

Wife: pick them up and show her the card nicely!

The husband picked up the keys and apologized to me. I was grateful that she called him out. I get keys tossed at me way too often. "
"Glad to hear you're okay, and don't blame yourself for what happened. When we're in situations like that, sometimes we just react, and it's not always logical. Stress like that can do strange things to your brain, and sometimes we react in ways we'd never see ourselves acting. You survived and you have experience to draw on next time, so there's no need to blame yourself for how things happened. "
"The sadder thing is, our wine tasting equals to about 4oz of wine total. That's probably less than what's in a child's juicebox. "
"Best thing I ever overheard in a store was a couple that likely isn't still together.

Wife: John can you grab a loaf of bread?

Husband: fuck you

Wife: John?

Husband: fuck you

Wife:  *can you just help me out here?*

Husband:  FUCK. YOU."
"His thought process was more “It can’t be *that* bad” followed by “Holy fuck this thing is completely broken.”  Too bad he didn’t think that one through beforehand.

Although...maybe he bought it with intent to fix it (electronics hobbyist?), but either when he saw just how fucked it was or perhaps when his wife found out the real reason he bought it, he decided to return it."
I am surprised they didn't argue more. 
"""I'm 5 seconds away from lying and saying I'm an art major with a minor in botany.""

I wish you had."
Who cut all these onions on aisle 3?
"My daughter went to school with a kid with a missing ear.

She came home one day and announced that he was having surgery that would fix his ear so it was presentable. 


Completely out of character, my wife said, tongue in cheek;"" You can give him a Happy New Year card, just scratch out one letter "
Savage Grandma strikes again! Holy crap I want to hug this lady!
"Okay, but you should have told me I killed it *before* I posted the story. Like, honestly?"
*Sniff* I needed this after today. What a lovely man and what a sweet kid. 
"And now you know - next time, defective units aren’t for sale. :("
"She should have just been given the boot...

How long will it be until companies realize these ""customers"" cost more than they're worth?"
"I've told this story many times before, but I can't resist every time the opportunity arises:

My father was a huge fan of Airplane!  I remember seeing it in the theater with him and he *literally* fell out of his seat laughing.  Whenever we were at a funeral and the officiant was reciting the psalm and got to ""Surely goodness and mercy"" my dad would lean over and whisper ""Don't call me Shirley"" and my sister and I would have to stifle a giggle.

Then his mother died.  His mother, whose name was Shirley. I stood there the whole time dreading what was coming.  I saw how upset he was, he had almost collapsed when he had to identify her body, but I also knew how much he loved a good joke, especially one he could beat to death.  So when they got to ""Surely..."" I looked over at him with the sternest glare I could muster.  He didn't say anything, but there was a sparkle in his eye and he looked down to hide a smile.

Then he died.  And I honored him the best way I could. We got to ""Surely goodness and mercy..."" and I'd like to say I laughed out loud, but I couldn't.  I did mutter quietly, ""Don't call me Shirley"" and smiled as tears ran down my cheeks. "
Where the hell can you buy all of that stuff with $36? I've been doing something wrong I think 
"I just love the adrenaline rush thought process.

""Sorry sir, I can't process your robbery until you provide evidence of actually having a gun""."
you seriously got written up for that??? it's like you're damned if you do and damned if you don't coz I'm sure your manager would have written you up for leaving your check out
"Kids are awesome, no filters, refreshingly  (sometimes painfully) open and honest lol"
"I have had similar experiences from customers looking at our hours that are posted on  Google.  I have tried changing them to the correct hours multiple times and they somehow change back within a day.

Customers phone and I say ""we don't open until 11am.""  ""But google says you open at 10am.""  ""Yeah, but the actual {store name} site has our correct hours posted."
"Sounds like a second hand, or thrift store. "
You need to claim the business. Google how to do it but they basically send you a post card with a code on it that gives you complete control over the Google listing.
"You have no idea, but here people will spend $250 for kid's overall, which they are going to wear for only one winter and then grow out of it. I guess it's because of the more prestigious neighbourhood we're at. "
I'm not kidding! And don't call me Shirley!
I misread and thought the mother the one who hugged you. It was a much more wild story that way. 
I was pulling a drive and the tray was stuck.  While trying to force it out my hand slipped and was sliced open on the frame edge.
Youre a dumbass. Glad you are ok. 
Omg! I wouldn't have been able to keep a straight face!
