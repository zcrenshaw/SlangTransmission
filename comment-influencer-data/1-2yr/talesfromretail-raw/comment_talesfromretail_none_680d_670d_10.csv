A 15-17 years old girl doesn't know what an ID is?
She B A S I C. 
"I work in pharmacy. The amount of times I have heard “I’m a diabetic” as an excuse for something is insane. It’s a serious medical condition, not a get out of jail free card. "
"Lotta coincedences there.  Broken guage and you can't prove that the gas pump is honest/correct?

Someone had just thought they found a way to get free gas."
"You seem to have the supply side down, but it would have been easier to explain the demand side.

""They cost that much because the market has determined that people are willing to pay that price for that product. If you do not wish to buy it, someone else will."""
Perfectly logical. Perhaps I should try that with my car.
"Wow, what a winner.

I mean, she at least had enough common sense not to leave her name.  But she did not have enough common sense to keep track of the bag she was using to steal?

Shame that she had enough smarts for the former, though.  It would have been great if she did leave her information."
"I really hate it when someone who works retail and deals with one of 'those' customers becomes one of 'those' customers. She knows how annoying it is when people demand to be let in to shop outside of hours, and yet she does it to you.

And as an aside, she works right next door and can't figure out a time when you're open and she'll be there to come in and pay the bill, and would rather make a scene outside her place of work while wearing the uniform? You might be right about her being crazy......."
"""I know i look like garbage now but look at how amazing i am usually!""
*shows you pictures that proves she is basic as fuck*

Amazing "
I agree this is the most surprising part. 
This is actually true.  Wings used to be discarded or sold really cheap.  Then some body thought of a way to market the wings as a snack/appetizer.  Now you can't go to a restaurant that doesn't have wings as an appetizer.
"I honestly doubt the cop paid for the gas out of his own pocket.  More than likely his conversation with the upset customer included ""...why don't you give me the money you owe them and I'll see if I can get them to not press charges."""
"Being a veteran Yu-gi-oh player of 10 years, I can assure you this guy is a minority (At least I hope). He clearly is new to the aspect of a TCG and doesn't understand the concept of how booster packs work.  

Also, I think he thought he could cheat the system by paying for a pack for $4 instead of the $50+ for one copy on the second hand market. "
"One of my associates said that a customer asked him which toilet paper was best. He told her ""I don't know I haven't wiped my ass with all of them."" The man is a fucking legend and the write up was worth it"
"I work at a bank and had an older woman on oxygen scoff when I asked for her ID. ""Do you carry your ID wherever you go?"" she asked. ""Yes ma'am, every day."""
Buy this double pack. Empty both cans in turn into your eyes. This will protect you against the bed bugs.
"Sounds like it worked too seeing as the cop paid for his gas and based off what the cop told OP, didn't get in any real trouble for the threat."
"&gt;... he said well ok then.

You have a very very good manager."
lol this *might* work if you dropped your ice cream on the ground right at the stand. They could take pity on you and get you another one. But that's probably the only time something like that would happen...
"Sending the one guy who was over age to buy the liquid that they were just asking about.

A. you **just** asked me about it.

B. I heard you tell him to go get it for you.

C. I dont care that I lost your buisness, since you shouldnt really be here anyways."
"""Excuse me officer, I seem to have misplaced my house."""
Doors won't open? Breaking and Entering is clearly the solution. 
Heroin addicts use it often to get them to sell needles to them. 
"If he was going to be such a brat about it, he could have just found a seller online that offers rare cards singly. I've done this with Poke'mon cards my brother wanted, and while it can be more expensive for a single card, it does beat buying countless packs of random additions in the hopes you get what you want. "
WTF herion addicts.  Get with the times and download the wish app and get your needles from china like all the methheads!  
"LOL, that reminds me of a lady I saw in a true crime show.  She was in jail for stealing out of other shopper's purses that'd been left in their carts.  She would immediately go buy gift cards at the same store, so she could profit before the credit cards were turned.  She got because she used her own awards card when making the purchase."
Apparently not. Then again with what they pulled 5 miniutes later id say the whole group wasnt all that bright
"Actually, he thought he could cheat the system by opening packs and endlessly “Get refunds” and open packs one by one essentially for free."
And for free
What do people try to use that as an excuse for in a pharmacy?
"Ditto... Sask service advisor here.
Booked 2 weeks in advance and that's servicing 110+ cars daily.  But yeah I had more calls this week than I can count.  I'm sorry, your inability to plan is not ""terrible service""  
"
"I'm betting a 50/50 split between she knows her husband is having an affair and is trying to figure out who the other woman is, and that she just forgot signing up for the card and is just your standard crazy customer blowing things out of proportion. Either is just as believable to me. Though either way I wouldn't have given out the info, because if it was an affair, I wouldn't want to be responsible for the fallout, and if it was just a crazy customer, I bet she would make a complaint about you helping her. "
Or a house 
Then I want you to water my plants. 
"I'm type 1 Diabetic and this kind of stuff angers me so much. It is a FREE SAMPLE. EAT ONE. You do not need to take any home as THEY ARE SAMPLES. In order for this logic to work, it would have to be common practice for non-diabetics to stuff 6 cookies in their face by the sample container. Meanwhile, we have Diabetics dealing with actual discrimination and lack of access to crucial medical supplies, and you're saying it's your right to *steal cookies*? No."
"“Miss, I came over here to greet you more directly after realizing that you didn’t hear me over your music precisely because I *did* in fact see you and we *do* in fact want your business, just like any other store would.  If I didn’t think you were worth it, I wouldn’t even have come over at all, but here I am.  Now, is there anything I can help you find today?”

In this big world, it’s always possible for two people to have the same experience several countries apart; I managed to calm one of these girls down once with more or less that exact sentence."
"&gt;The cop even paid for the gas.

&gt;Times sure have changed.

Yeah, they have changed. 

These days, if you drive off and don't pay for your gas, you can lose your license "
Especially if you know youre going to the bank thay day.
"She should have gotten the lady's home address and said ""okay then, so by your logic, since you'll be home tonight, I can come by at 1 am and expect you to open the door for me? After all, there *are* people inside *your* house. Right?"""
"Reminds me of a time a customer and her friend came to me to check out.  The lady I was helping was acting strange.  I really couldn't figure it out, but thought maybe she didn't like my makeup or something (it was a makeup counter).  So I am just checking her out, minding my own business. I go to hand her the change and she says ""Yes! I have a cold sore!""  I was so damned shocked.  I looked at her friend in bafflement who was just laughing.  

Lady, I didn't notice the cold sore and really didn't even know what they were back then.  Well, not until she yelled about it.  "
"&gt;I got a sticker on the wall in the back room for a couple of weeks.

Leave it to retail companies to turn a thank you into a condescending fuck you."
I don't. Therefore my jealousy dictates that I hate you.
"The reason you pay tax, despite your item being discounted, is that taxes are calculated based on the full sale *value* of the item purchased. Your coupon removes $2.50 off of your final total."
"Always wanted to say to customers like that

&gt; ""I'm sorry, but if you don't know this stuff and not going to bother to put any effort into learning you are better off seeking professional help and not a DIY kit."""
"You should have laughed.  If no one ever puts someone like that on spot for such behavior, it'll never end."
They refused to leave the store after being told to and the police *left*? What the fuck. That would've been awesome to see them get dragged out in cuffs.
"As a cashier, my version of this is the damn chip reader machines. Ours suck, so if the customer puts the card in backwards I have to reset the machine which takes about 10 seconds and if they try to put the chip back in, the screen will freeze on the ""please wait, do not remove card"" screen. 

Customer: *puts card in backwards, hears the machine shriek, immediately pulls card out and shoves it in the other way*

Cashier: ""Please remove the card, I have to reset the machine.""

Customer: ""But it says not to take it out.""

Cashier: ""I know, but please take the card out, I need to reset it because it's stuck on that screen.""

Customer: ""But it says 'do not remove,' on the screen.""

And repeat until cashier gets sick of it and reaches over and pulls the card out themselves. "
"Also, remind her that she isn't a customer if she is calling the store."
At leaat split up before hand. Give me some sort of plausible deniability.
"Just the other night my wife got some hot cocoa from a gas station, and then she proceeded to leave it on the roof of our car and drove away...

She went back to the gas station, got another cup and explained what happened. The gas station clerk let her take that one for free.

I think if it's small enough, good customer service should be able to help customers who make mistakes. But it's definitely not something that you should expect as a customer to get every time, especially when the service/good being provided is expensive (the hot cocoa probably cost the store like 50 cents). "
"Either do I and I found out that if they don't already understand the concept, no amount of explaining on the spot will help them come to terms with the idea. 

I worked at a pizza restaurant with online ordering and some walk-ins would get super offended by people who ordered ahead. Really seemed to think they were cheating the system somehow and we were monsters for letting it happen. "
"I can actually imagine this happening in real life, and that makes me a little sad."
"&gt; SH: These strawberries are so tiny. It's pathetic! You're pathetic. I bet they're awful.

And probably feels the same way about baby peas, baby carrots, and... well, babies."
I remember the good days when chicken wings were garbage and you could buy them for cents per pound. So awesome.
"That's a great story! Those people probably do that often and have put smiles in others' faces.

The world could use more of that!"
"Ok, so I know there are still Somali pirates, but I dont think they use skull and crossbones as their symbol 


Who does she think will be offended? The fsmilies of the victims of pirates were killed off long ago by a much more heartless fiend: time




Now, a time traveler might be offended, but as I said above, time has claimed more victims than even the cruelest of tyrants...they are probably offended by clocks"
"I just realized that booster packs are the predecessor of in-game loot boxes in mobile (and some desktop) games.
"
"**Epilogue**

From what I hear, the police called us back for more information and sent an officer in to check up on us (we were so busy, I didn't even notice my boss being interviewed). The day ended...

...and a new day started. 

And halfway through the day, Lady came back, with her Sister in tow. I noticed because BrashOwner suddenly exclaimed,

&gt; BrashOwner: What are you doing in here? I said you were banned! Get out of my store! 

&gt; Sister: I'm sorry, she does not know very much English, she wants me to talk to you. 

&gt; BrashOwner: Fine, you're allowed in here, but she isn't, tell her to get out!

Sister talks to Lady and she steps out of the store. Sister turns to BrashOwner. She has a sleazy tone to her voice, speaking slowly and ""persuasively"", like a used car salesman. 

&gt; Sister: Looooook, my sister, she's very sorry she got angry yesterday. She did not mean to make you so mad, she just wants to exchange her boots. 

&gt; BrashOwner: I understand that, but it's not allowed. And she called the police on us! In front of my customers! Do you understand how that impacts us?

&gt; Sister: Yes, yes, I understand she called the police, and she very sorry, very very sorry. 

&gt; BrashOwner: That's great, but she's still banned.

&gt; Sister: Yes, yes, she still banned, she's very sorry. Wants to apologize. Won't come in again.

&gt; Sister: All she needs is to get the boot exchanged.

&gt; BrashOwner: Are you kidding me?

Lady comes in (because she's crazy) and joins her sister. BrashOwner starts telling her to get out again. 

&gt; Lady: I just want exchange! You make a 13-year-old girl cry!

&gt; BrashOwner: Well I'm sorry your daughter cried, but so what? Get out of my store!

&gt; Sister: Look, I am a customer here, we're just asking for you to exchange... I am a customer, *when I have kids I will come here to buy shoes*! 

Yeah... real customer... totally...

Anyway, Lady is sent out again, and several circular arguments commence. Sister eventually exchanges the boots for a smaller size (because the 13-year-old girl totally won't grow, right?) and leaves, never to return again.

Also, turns out last year MeekOwner processed an exchange for Lady on her charity boots. So you know, just a lesson in not letting customers break the rules because it'll just reinforce their behaviour..."
"For me it's always ""I need one of these three sizes"" because despite being a woman my feet are wide enough to require men's shoes, sometimes even in a wide width.  So... I can't really say l know my shoe size. "
"She didn't want you to touch any of the product that she was buying, so she kindly brought you a duplicate of everything that you were allowed to touch. It was actually very considerate of her to assist you in not infecting her with your lowliness."
"did you accidentally  wander into a south park episode? 

.... did Kanye West show up ranting about hobbits? 

"
Wow! What ever shall you do? Now you can’t illegally sell things to people who can’t buy them...you will go out of business doing that.
