lol. He didn't want to use the toilet like a five year old but decided to act like a five year old instead.
"This happened at my old store but we were not allowed to actually give them the money. The couponers would have to find merchandise they wanted to bring the total up to zero or just lose out on the credit. 


They were awesome though and would buy the chasiers sodas and candy with the credits. One time I even got  new straightener out of it."
Some people just don't pay attention to their surroundings or have any situational awareness.
"There was a time before civilization, before we learned how to make tools and weapons, when people like that were eaten by lions."
To answer OP's question about the grocery store and ham....YES! among many other things. 
"Holy hell, you are having a lot of bad luck. I'm glad you're getting yourself a new job. Wish you the best of luck in your adventures."
"*customer comes up to the till with a massive bag of grapes/cherries/oranges/whatever*

Me: That’ll be $8.50

Customer: But the sign says $1.50!!!!

Me: Yes, PER POUND. 

Customer: I’ve NEVER heard of that before, I want to speak with the manager!!"
"This is why my boss doesn’t allow us to give them out as change anymore. We save up the gold dollars, Susan B’s and half dollars and just turn them into our bank. My customers just can’t process a 5th coin. "
"A good customer know that the register processes sales and coupons as programmed, not as a calculator for whatever addition and subtraction the cashier feels like plugging into it."
"There's no way you could've known. Chin up!

This does remind me of an interaction I had with a regular customer a few weeks ago, though. He was buying several disposable aluminum pans, so I casually asked him, jokingly, ""What are ya making for me?"" He listed off a couple things, homemade mac-n-cheese, ribs, etc., and I was like, ""Oh, man, that sounds awesome, where's the party?"" Then he sort of looked at me and said, ""You remember &lt;old coworker&gt;? His mother passed away so I'm making them food for the memorial."" My heart almost exploded out of my chest. It was awful."
I don't get where people get the mentality that they can still be served if they outsmart the employees after closing time. After the registers are closed down there is literally no way I can help you. Leave.
"I worked in the pharmacy at a large chain too. it SUCKS. I totally sympathize with you. Especially when you would try to save them money by offering the store brand. 
""But I was told by my doctor to get tylenol!""
Ma'am...any allergies?
""No""
Okay, this is the same active ingredient as tylenol and it's on sale.
""HE SAID TYLENOL!!!!!""

"We had a Code Adam once for a 10 year old kid.  We tore the place apart for several minutes with no luck and the PD was called.  After another 15 minutes searching, nothing.  The mother was losing her mind.  By this time we had several more cops there and all of their vehicles out front.  A guy walks in and asked what was going on, he thought he had been robbed.  We told him we had a Code Adam and the guy asked what the kid looked like.  The guy was from the local neighborhood a few minutes away.  He said while he was driving over to my store, he saw a kid matching the description of the missing one, walking down the street.  Turns out the the lady lived right nearby.  Cops sent a patrol car over, that literally burned rubber leaving our parking lot, to go over there and check to see if the kid was there.  Kid was home playing video games.  He said got bored and walked home.       "
Some of you might recognize my username from my post from yesterday and wonder why I'm posting about different jobs. I just found out about this subreddit and I love it! I've had 4 different jobs in retail and now I'm a banker! 
You sound really arrogant in this story.
"That's so nice of them. A sweet gesture, since I imagine scanning all those coupons and just keeping track of them was a hassle. "
Isn’t this the premise behind those stupid extreme couponing shows?
The good old days. 
Saw a $2 bill when I was 6 and asked if it was worth $100 because I had never seen them before. I was not a bright child 
"This so much.

The active ingredient must be the same by law. The only difference is the dyes and binding ingredients. If you dont have any known allergies, you will be fine with store brand.

So many people don't understand this and think because it's twice as much it must work twice as good.

No, in Most cases you are paying for the brand name. My store brand makes every generic. The timed release, the fast acting, the gel caps, you name it."
"Also why they got cancelled - most were advocating straight up coupon fraud.

EDIT: for those curious, [here's](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/ethics-couponing-coupon-fraud/story?id=19961922) an article on what coupon fraud is.  Mostly, the extreme couponing shows were advocating to photocopy coupons and trying to use coupons out of date."
"&gt; now I'm a banker!

Ohh lala!  Somebody's fancy. "
"I wish I was paid by the homie, no one ever pays by the homie.... "
"She looked like a newbie. Supervising officer even had to tell her three times to turn on the tazer. I was in the parking lot waving down the officers, and I was the first person she saw, I guess. Tazer was trained on me before she was even fully out of the car. 

I really hope she learns how to control herself better in those situations, because that easily could've been a lawsuit, assuming the voltage didn't kill me for some reason"
"&gt;The robbers gun was apparently a BB gun, but he's now looking at 10-25 with no priors

""He who robs with gun in hand is looking at 25 years to life in the can."""
"Thanks! I've got a few things that I can do, and I'm not sure if I said so in my post but I might work with my friend at his security firm. Otherwise I'm gonna start looking into getting into animal rescue. "
Why wouldn't you hit the ATM BEFORE being rung up? 
SERIOUSLY “Maybe if I REALLY REALLY BELIEVE the store is not closed then everyone else will just have to play along!”
Fabric stores hate this one simple trick to free fabric...
"It's only because they look at it from an individual perspective. They assume that as soon as they place the order, it immediately goes to the workroom, and someone immediately picks it up and starts working on it. In that case, 4 weeks to sew a pair of curtains, no matter how custom, would be ridiculous."
"He's a big boy though, so he has to use the urinal."
"I wonder why some people don't get the hint the store is closing. Shutting off the light is an *obvious* sign the store is closing. I've even experience people pull open metal shutters(it's not locked yet, just closed half way) and walk in as nothing is wrong."
Yeah but after a while I just stopped caring. I mean I get paid by the homie so sure I’ll spend a ton of time working on this one transaction lol. Unless they were rude then it sucked
"When I worked at a gas station this middle-aged guy pulled up to the pumps about 5 mins after we closed. All the lights in the store were off, except for the lights above the register, and the doors were locked. The pay-at-pump also shuts off when the last cashier logs out of the register. 

This guy's was so pissed that he walked up to the door and started yelling at me through the glass. He just wanted to get gas. I tried explaining over the intercom that there was nothing I could do. Extremely upset, he went to the 24hr gas station across the street. 

The next afternoon the same guy comes back. I thought for sure this wasn't going to end well. He stands in my line patiently and when he gets to the counter he says ""you were the one I yelled at last night, right?"" I said yes, expecting some kind of confrontation.

This guy goes on to apologize to me for the way he acted the previous night. I was speechless. Something about having a bad day or something. At that point, it didn't matter. This guy was so humble. Guess who got his coffee for free that day?"
"Nah, they know; people like this actively abuse 'customer is always right' culture, and assume that employees will usually choose to do the ""right"" thing by serving them rather than confront them and potentially make a scene (which these types of customers purposefully do to enforce their behaviour). 

I don't care how distracted you are, no functioning adult could fail to notice the lack of customers, or multiple closing pages, and even a toddler would notice the fucking lights going out. They just don't care."
I once had a customer think that a whole bunch of crab legs only came out to be 9.99 and got mad when the total came out to be like 27 dollars...not realizing that it was 9.99 a pound. He even went back to grab another bag thinking that the tag had scanned wrong.
This was beautiful.
"Somewhat related but not really. My mom went to a going out of business sale for a fabric store chain. 

She gets there and starts to pick a bunch of fabric because, well, it's super cheap. Nice fabric for like 50¢/yard. Cool. 

After all the fabric is cut, the electronic labeler or something messes up so the employee doing the cutting has to manually label with UPC codes and prices each item in like 10+ cuts. Somehow at the end of it all only one item had an actual scannable code.  

When my mom gets to the register the cashier takes the scannable one. $3. She then looks at the rest of them and doesn't even try to scan a single one. She tells my mom that it's $3.xx. Being that my mom was taken aback, she asks the cashier about the other fabric. Cashier replies and says, eh, I'm not gonna do all that work. 

And this is like the only time when ""if it doesn't scan, it's free!"" Has ever been true for my family."
I can only imagine the hell the mother gave her child when she got home!!
"Sorry ma'am. Let's process a return and then I can do it correctly for you...

[process return]

OK, now before we start, I want you to decide when we scan the coupon so things come out the way you want them to, OK?

OK. Do you want me to scan the shampoo or the coupon? Shampoo? OK.

OK, Now do you want me to scan the coupon, or go ahead and scan the other shampoo?

Shampoo? OK.

Alright. Both shampoos have been scanned. Coupon now? OK coupon now.

Anything else today? Nope? OK, your total is $x.xx.

Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe if we scan the coupon before the 2nd shampoo it'll work. Let's process another return and try it again. 
"
She had no sense. I would have laughed as well. 
"I've done this before, I've let customer do everything but actually touch my register and scanner just to prove to them they are in fact, an idiot. "
Do what we (Canada) did and delete the penny. :D
"Wait, does he have a urinal in his home? We sure as heck don't, and all the guys in my house use the toilet as I assume most men do at home. I mean, I don't think I've ever seen a house with a urinal (although I'm sure they exist) and I don't understand how using a toilet for its intended purpose is a bad thing. "
Wow she went full customer right of the bat.
"You sound like an ass. They arent super common and if someone isnt familiar with you dont have to play games and try to make them look like fools. Clearly no one thought you were purposely shorting them. If people calming asking you about the change you gave them is your idea of retail hell or a bad cashier experience, you got alot to learn about the lovely world you work in. "
"For businesses too! My friend has his own business of repairing hospital beds. He said he had to raise his price because people were thinking that if he's not expensive, he's not that good. Said he raised his prices and had a huge increase in business. "
We are going to make it hail. 
Damn yeah that's not fun at all. 
"The point is that it was meant to look like they had a gun, regardless if it were real or not. I agree with it honestly."
Also delete the $1 and $2 notes like the rest of the world.
"We are cash only. Marijuana industry, banks aren't all on board with it yet."
Hahahaha wtf you should have said yes if he can say Nintendo he can purchase 
... and a soul was saved
"Hug hug hug, then the ass kicking of a lifetime (figuratively?)"
"That's part of the problem, people don't get embarrassed. "
"I had a man try to bust our doors open with a crowbar once.  He said he thought ""they were just stuck""."
"""Excuse me. Did you mean to put the beginning of your sentence in the middle of mine?"""
"I agree, it's not that hard to say ""sorry, out of bills, here's a dollar coin"", especially if it was happening time after time. "
"Nice work, it’s so refreshing to hear a story like this....
I was in a phone shop not long ago, the young male attendant was chatting to a lady who would have been in her 80’s. Her husband had died the day before, I could see the pain in her eyes while she was explaining how she doesn’t know what to do about her internet, mobile phone and home phone as her husband was the one that knew how to use them and she can no longer afford to keep them. The male attendant, said “we are busy at the moment, give me your name and we will give you a call when we have an available appointment”. 
He said it with a tone that was almost aggressive and demeaning towards her, I am not sure that ‘he’ was a human. This truly sickened me and wish I had thought of some kind of action to take at the time... I refuse to go into this store now. "
"The American legal system reminds me of a certain scene in Goodfellas when it comes to crimes committed whilst brandishing a firearm:

""It was unloaded.""

Fuck you, 25 to life. 

""It was a BB/paintball/toy gun.""

Fuck you, 25 to life.

""I never even pulled the trigger.""

Fuck you, 25 to life.

I know it's not all that Draconian, but using a gun really ups the ante. 
"
These types of people are called manipulators. They take advantage of every single thing they can in ALL aspects of life. Don't make the mistake of thinking being a retail customers is the only time they pull this type of stunt.
"I had this a few years ago, wasn't my favourite teacher though and she didn't remember me lol! I like your version waaaaay better"
"Translation: I was going to rob you, and I didn't think anyone was in here."
"This is a time when you stop what you are doing and look at the situation.

Problem: Customers unhappy with change, extra time is taken to educate customers. Customers are left unhappy, despite having correct change.

Current solution: Laugh at them when they leave and call them stupid. 

Problem persists.

Alternative Solution: Offer customer gold dollars before handing back change. Customers desiring coinage receive it, those who prefer bills receive those. Customers do not become confused or upset.

Problem solved.

New problem: Nothing to post to reddit.

Solution: Wait until the next horrible customer appears, it won't be long in retail."
