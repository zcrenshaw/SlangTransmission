fuck those guys

"Since there isn't one, I'll add a positive top comment. 

I am glad that you didn't panic. Not sure I could be so calm or even notice the guy rack the gun twice. I guess you never know how you'll react till it happens. Glad you made it out okay, always let insurance pick up the tab. "
I can see why shes single.
"&gt;SM: Hold on, let me hear his side first



Every person in retail is jealous with how much your manager has your back."
Dollar coins are nearly as fun as $2 bills.
"Also from Canada and when I was a cashier and had a nasty rude customer I used to crush their chips and pinch/squish their bread. 
"
"OK but was it okay if she could get that coupon back? She does it all the time at OTHERLOCATION. 

Total disintetest is such a great way to deal with pissy customers. I'm also glad SM wanted to hear your side first. My SM won't backup his employees and will always apologize about us when we're following policies...... ðŸ˜‘"

ðŸ˜Ž I'm a petty bitch and I accept that
Being a bitch-ass *customer* is illegal à² _à² 
"When I was robbed I saw it coming. My story:

It was 2005 and working midnight shift at a gas station(Get-Go) that also had a deli that was 24/7. There was a CCTV/Light dead zone in our parking lot and I saw a car pull in and park there.  He was sitting there for at least 15 minutes but when the store was clear he started to get out and I saw he had a head cover.  I yelled to our deli girl(100lbs. Wet and barely 18) to get into the back room and lock the door. She asked why and I said well we are about to get robbed, she ran FAST.  He came in with gun out, I said no reason to have that out, I'll give you what you want.  He shrugged and holstered it.  I opened the drawer, he took a few cartons of cigs, and lottery tickets.  What he doesn't know I already hit the alarm with my foot.  He leaves, cops come, they have nothing to go on because no plate#, no face, etc.  I told the cop he took lottery tickets and it was like Christmas morning for him.  They caught him 3 days later cashing a few in.  AT MY STORE and he was a regular. "
"I feel bad for the person she is marrying. She probably acts like a wonderful person and will turn into this creature as soon as the wedding is over... 

Sorry you went through that! "
"Before you said you knew the school, I thought the kid was going to be in the right 


I didn't graduate hs until 2 months before my 19th birthday bc I didn't start school until I was 6 "
"Every time I think people can't get any worse at not listening, I come to this sub and I'm proven wrong. "
"Thanks! I'd give gold but I'm a lowly cashier saving for a car :/ so here's some honorary gold! Lol. 

Yeah it's hard to determine how you'll react. I always liked to think I could handle it well, and proved it to myself tonight. I guess I'm just good under pressure. While I've been around guns and dangerous environments since my childhood, I've never been directly involved in a conflict with a gun. I'm also not military or retired police, so I guess I just got lucky to have nerves of steel! 

That being said, I had a delayed reaction after everything was said and done. About 4 hours after it happened, I started getting splashed with waves of stress and anxiety for a while

I was fortunate to have seen the guys mask before anything happened, so I had a second to take a breath and react. My manager is the real MVP here, because she didn't have any warning, she was caught off guard entirely, and still held herself. 

Honestly, the only reason I noticed it get racked a second and third time was because my mind totally blanked, and I went into kind of a zen state where I was able to pick up on any small details. Sorry for drawing this out like this, my comment was originally supposed to be like a fifth of this length, lol. "
Uhhh......I will be right back.
"Thanks for saving this little fellow. I would say he was more sacred than your coworker but I'm not too sure about that.

 Also, yay, now you are the animal guy. Prepare for spiders, mice, dogs, straycats and maybe some snakes in the future. If you are lucky there might also be some bats."
I want as few bags as possible. Even with my puny skinny arms I will do my best to bring EVERYTHING inside in one trip; even if itâ€™s 20 bags. Thats 15 bags in one arm. 5 in the other so I can also hold the key to unlock the door. ðŸ˜œ
You guys should put up a sign or something with the address to the new location.
"too bad op never said ""I can see why she's your ex"""
But I have the VIN! it's not like anyone could get that info by just walking by my car right? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"Nice catch. I once caught 2 guys doing credit fraud at same red shirt chain, and quickly worked with security to get cops to our store while I kept them busy. Well, they were on a 3 strike deal with the US courts and hit their third strike, which meant jail time... and the court subpoenaed all of us involved. 

After this, corporate said ""no more credit fraud arrests, you can only decline fraud"""
*Especially* in Canada
I wish my employer didn't frown upon us accepting tips. Customers are always offering me tips for helping them get stuff into their car or whatever and I have to respectfully decline every time because I don't want to get fired. Good for you though dude! 
Bet the people working there have some stories regarding that rule. 
"&gt; I feel bad for the person she is marrying. 

I sincerely hope she's marrying my ex"

""" this will probably get downvotes "" this is not /talesfromcustomers we all hate those troglodytes here"
"That's when you cancel the transaction, and inform him he can leave the store now and find his groceries elsewhere. You have a bad cowardly manager if they let people throw things at employees. "
Ok.
"That's always the best way to do it. Don't corner them, just guide them politely to the till and act like they're actually going to pay for them.
Sometimes they end up paying in the end because they're so embarrased."
One trip or die trying.
Yeah he's not my direct supervisor so I don't deal with him often but that gave me a lot of respect for him.
"Like you said, it is their name on the building,but I hate it when they give in to the customer without really knowing the whole story. "
Ok.
Some customers REALLY don't understand that they're not the ONLY customer  
Murphy says that it won't be long before the other customer comes in to pick up their equipment.
"I would lose my job over calling him a couple of hours later ""I'm sorry but the other customer came in and also wanted to take a receiver home to build a shelf as well. We had to give him yours. I know you can't see how sorry I am over the phone so if you want you can come in to see how sorry I am. We went ahead and made a new order for a new one. It will be in January 12th and you can come pick it up any day after that.""

Worth the unemployment. "
"I also have one. I got mine a bit later when the only 3 colours were pink, black and white. Since the neighbouring had the black one and my brother had the white one I got the pink one.

 It lasted me many years before some cable probably broke and the upper screen stopped working. I then got a used one in the guitar hero edition. That one still lives happily.

 So I can understand how much it sucks when the Christmas present is broken but I guess not hearing the full sentence out might never be a good idea. Then again I do want to know what he told his little girl later on."
We use chip readers all the time.  that woman was just an eejit.
"""I fucked up and made things harder so you should give me a discount!"". Sheesh. Some people."
"That actually makes sense under some circumstances.    

Stuff like this happens to me all the time:  I have another errand to do within the next half-hour, and will be busy for the rest of the day.  Stuff like that can easily lead to a case of needing the task done in ""Either less than ten minutes, or next week"".

With that said, there is no reason to be rude about it when placing the order.

These boots are made for walkin'... 
"Luckily around here, there are no schools with what we call Sixth Form in it, and so you finish when your 16. If it had a sixth form you would finish at 18, so that would be fair enough."
not coming back? he would get a ban the first time he threw that insult at me.
"I have always been the animal girl lol, I have a bearded dragon and two cats at home, my family has a sulcata tortoise. I rescue animals all the time.

The hardest one was a bird that flew into the store and then flew into the window trying to escape. He kept flying back in. "
It was taught to me by a cashier in her 50s! I was a very timid person till 3months as a cashier changed that! After 5 years I could never do retail again! 
"You let her know she could leave the backroom, right? "
Getting between an addict and their substance is like getting between a mother cow and her calf.
"Okay it was accidental, for a moment thought this would end a lot more grossed up."
The concept that children's feet grow is lost on her.
"Use to run a copy center and I've lost count of the number of people who needed their order done ""ASAP TODAY"". So I would move orders  around bust my ass to get the rush order done and all the the other order done on time. They the wouldn't show back up, I'd call them, ""Oh I'll got delayed, I'll pick it first thing tomorrow."" 

Three days later they finally come get the copies. "

"Please don't micromanage this person through the internet, I'm sure they know how to do their job, and have been doing their job properly before your wisdom."
The way it should be. 
"They are being installed in a few days.  Thankfully, our order for more equipment arrived before the end of day.  It all will work out."
"Why bother arguing with him at all and trying to guess his age? You tell him to produce his ID or he can't buy it. Simple, and stops you from being potentially wrong. 
"
"Check your employee handbook!!! At my job it's also ""frowned upon"" but the rules clearly say we're allowed to accept gifts or tips from customers so we can't get fired if it happens. But we're **supposed** to deter them from doing it, according to management. "
"That's interesting. I know in SC, of you rob a store with a Nerf gun but the clerk thinks it is real you're getting charged just as though it was real. "
One of the main rules of retail right up there with the customer cannot read and the customer always lies is the customer never listens.
"That's where i go ""do you know who it was? Thanks for letting us know so we can send them for retraining """
"Heh. I have a semi regular customer that pays in dollar coins resulting in similar chaos. 

Had a cashier ask me if they are real, then if we are allowed to take them. Customer and I got a chuckle. 

I've learned to ask customers if they would like them before I give them back as change. Mostly to give them a mental cue that something ""unusual"" is coming. Never had anyone say no, since they are a bit of a novelty. "
"Yeah but at least you understand thatâ€™s a *you* problem, not the storeâ€™s problem, and absolutely not the employees problem. Thatâ€™s the issue here. "
"Reminds me of a guy who called an auto parts store looking for a new battery for his car except when the employee asked what make and model the car was all the guy would tell him was the car was blue.  

Finding out the car is drive-able the employee convinces the guy to bring the car in so they can determine the make and model for him and get him the correct battery.

He came in.  The car was red.

"
"Could be worse...

Can I get your VIN?

Uhm...it's blue?  Kind of a light blue."
"Such a shame.

Not much hope of a kid growing up well adjusted with a mother like that."
Your manager is Not OK
"There was a night when I was working at a pretzel place that doesn't rhyme and we were low on bites when we got hit with a rush. The girl I'm working with isn't feeling well, so she goes in the back and leaves me to deal with the customers. I've got a woman and her two daughters, then a woman and her son come through. The woman with her daughters get two large pretzel bites and the one and her son get a small. I've got enough to scrape together all three and the woman and her daughters are standing nearby when I serve the second woman her pretzel bites.

Here's where it all went to hell.

I set the tongs I used down on the counter - a counter which nobody touches, a counter that has been freshly cleaned - and the woman loses it. She wants a new set of pretzel bites because she thinks it's ""gross"". I explain to her that is where we put the tongs, it's where we *always* put the tongs, but she isn't having it. Cue the other woman hearing, and now SHE wants fresh bites, too.

Here's where it goes to even more hell. My coworker hadn't set a timer for the bites, so while I'm dealing with this, they're all burning. So I have no bites, I don't have enough dough to make what I need, and there is *no* *dough* *in* *the* *fridge*. IIRC, the woman with her son just ended up asking for a refund and I had to send the woman and her daughters to our downstairs location with the promise that they'd get one of their bites for free.

Freaking hell man."
This is such a sweet little tale. You seemed like a hero to that little girl! 
"&gt; no more credit fraud arrests, you can only decline fraud

that's fucked up. so corporate is willing to let these folks go on (attempting to) committing credit fraud?

Edit: you know, when I made this comment I assumed that ""credit fraud = registering fake credit cards"", not that they were fraudulently returning goods. If it's the latter, then yeah I can totally understand why the store would let that go. I was assuming that people were signing up credit cards with stolen identities, or using stolen credit information. "
Thats not really a thing in the UK. I mean I am not saying it never happens or has never happened but I legit just thought it was some movie thing. I have never heard of holding someone back a year as even been on the table. 
The Spice must flow!
The f*** did I read lmao
