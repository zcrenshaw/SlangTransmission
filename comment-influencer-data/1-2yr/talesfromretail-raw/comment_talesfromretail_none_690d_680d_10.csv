"""Today I Made a Customer Cry""

Oh good I bet she deserves it.


""I was helping this friendly lady""

Oh no......


""And gave me a big hug""

YES!"
"&gt; The lady called corporate to complain and was rewarded about $20 in store “points” for her “troubles”

And this is why people do it."
"&gt;I'm calling the better business bureau

People who say this, I always have to ask ""What has that ever accomplished for you?"""
The 4 year old is adorable and the mom is a great mom fort coming back in. 
I was accused of being on Facebook on our POS system because I was typing a lot. “We don’t even have a web browser.” I was sending an email to corporate. :/ 
I've been threatened one time where I work. Dudes completely ban from all 3 stores in town. And that pissed him off. Fuck him.
It's like old people yelp
"If you’re young, you should be expecting to be asked for ID no matter what you’re trying to buy. That’s how life works. I’ve never understood why so many people take offence to being asked to prove you are who you say you are. "
I wish more people knew that the BBB is not a government agency.
I don’t get how someone doesn’t understand the concept of a preorder.
"Some shops let you get tattoos if you're 16 as long as you have parent permission.

Sooooo, it's no proof of anything. "
Was totally not expecting that! What a great story :)
Maybe Ren called ahead and mentioned she was coming by to pick it up? The only reason I can think it was on the front counter. 
"""You'd get more shopping done if you minded your fucking business."""
"You've gotta be a bad kind of old man to threaten a young man with your wife nearby. What happened to courtesy and respect, the idealisms that millennials destroyed? /s"
"I get that a lot when using our scanner at work. Its basically a mini computer. ""You'd get more work done if you were off your phone.""

Ugh..."
I ready the abridged version in the previous post.  The details make it even worse!  I applaud you for tearing down the screen and throwing them out.  No one needs customers like that.  
"Did you not get the memo?

Clairvoyance is now a prerequisite for all retail employees since forever!"
I had an irate customer follow me to my car trying to start something. He swung at me and I defended myself with a maglight. He tried to file a lawsuit against the business but the assault charge I filed plus his blood alcohol being twice the legal limit did not help his case. Bastard had to have his jaw wired shut and all I had was a couple nasty bruises on my forearm and chest.
Happens far to often. Seeing people get the satisfaction of being “right” drives me crazy. Makes us employees look stupid. 
Higher ups that don't back up their employees are THE WORST
Ikr.  That was a rush of emotions.  Lovely story.
Probably better to get your manager anyway. That's most likely where it would have ended but you'd also have all of this food that was made for an order that couldn't be paid. 
"This is why we need my one slap law, every time someone utters stupidity you are allowed to slap them once. "
"&gt; ""Put that in your pipe and smoke it!""

Dealing with most customers makes me want to get blazed, actually, so yes, I might just do that."
Yelp is horrible to small business. They hide good reviews unless you pay them. Extortion at its worst. 
Imagine being so cheap you want *used brakes*. Does she buy used groceries too?
"The title was an intentional misdirection. I like to be positive, when I can, and for the most part our customer base is pretty good. :)"
"Of your really inclined, if you have her information you can probably find out where her husband works and make a complaint with his commanding officer. Your spouse absolutely cannot throw the partners rank or position around like that, it very much is frowned upon."
"Who knows wtf they heard.

What gets me is I hear things wrong all the time and I don't have any serious hearing issues. I know people with serious hearing issues will mishear things all the time and fly into a rage without verifying what anyone is saying no matter how insane the things they heard were said."
"&gt; I want mocha buttercream but without the espresso

Wut. "
"&gt; Bastard had to have his jaw wired shut

I choose to think that was his sentence, rather than a medical necessity."
I know! I couldn't stop thinking about it and thought people would love a nice happy(ish) story here 
"Was once threatened with death because I wouldn't sell liquor to someone who didn't have an ID. He went full thug, ""You don't know who I am, I know people... You won't live through the year.""

That was six years ago."
"Managers are managers because they are good at management. 

Knowing where products are located in the store is the realm of people who touch products all day. Like stockers and sales floor personnel. 

We divide labor for a reason. "
"What I don’t understand are people not carrying their ID on them all the time. I very rarely leave my wallet in a vehicle and never leave it at home. 

Maybe it’s just a weird back of my mind thing from watching crime shows, but if you don’t have your ID and you get murdered or kidnapped or what ever the police can’t identify you! Don’t other people think of this? "
"This is what I hate. Rewarding customer tantrums just trains and encourages customers to be manipulative, whiny a-holes. It teaches them that if you make a fuss for long enough and loud enough, you'll get your way. \&gt;:("
He didn't say which year.
I've had customers give me reusable bags to put their groceries in and it reeks of cat urine and is covered in cat hair! And that's just one reason I always have hand sanitizer on me at all times!
"Back at my previous office supply retail related employment, we had ""Mobis"" that we could use to change inventory, ring up customers, etc. 

We too got that whole ""texting"" thing. 

I could be up a ladder putting away extra inventory and some customer would be upset that I was ""slacking off"" and not helping them."
"So she got two free cakes, one of which was exactly to her liking, FOR FREE, and still cried about it? Sounds like she just wants more free stuff. It's insane how far people are willing to go to get free things, even if it IS cake, lol."
You are a good person.  Oh this makes me both so sad and happy for her.
"I recognize that policy. I hate it. Thankfully, not many customers try to enforce it at my store."
I used to manage a dollar store in Baltimore Maryland. I was threatened at least once a day. Mostly shoplifters I caught. My car keyed. Things thrown at me. Corp wouldn't ad security so I noped right out of there and took a job with a competitor in rural Pennsylvania.  My stress level dropped a full 80%.
I am sorry mam I am the tank not the sorcerer 
"Great job, awesome for the copy! 

My mom texted me a while back and said their hard drive died. Essentially they lost everything from our graduations to great grandmas 108th birthday in '08, to the cruises, etc.

I sent her a link to my dropbox drive and told her I backed up the drive when I lived at home."
I love this story
That last bit is absolutely amazing. 
"""I don't understand technology so I'm just going to assume you're screwing around!"""
"&gt; But I told you to wait and pump my gas.

“Unfortunately, ma’am, you aren’t the person who signs my paychecks, so you don’t get to tell me how to do my job.”"
Oh THANKS for that.
"Hey wait, I just realized we are an employees owned company as well!  I am going to assign myself a great parking spot, as I am an owner after all!"
Wow. I mean wow. Almost dying for some merch. What a dumbass.
"Reminds me of that scene in Catwoman.

""White Russian, no vodka.""

""Here you go, glass of milk.""

I'm paraphrasing. The movie was terrible."
"Also, if you travel to places with let’s say lax laws, like Bali, they don’t care how old you are just as long as you can pay for the tattoo. "
You'd be surprised. I used to work in a theme park and was threatened by angry parents quite a bit when their children couldn't ride after queuing due to their height.
"Dude, well done.  Before I switched careers and was still a carpenter, I used to get the ""well I could do it cheaper than that myself!"" From homeowners all the time.  No, you can't.  Or you wouldn't call me... a carpenter.

No I won't show you how.  You fucking go to school and learn how."
"I seriously hate customers like this. I can't tell you how many people I have come into my store with ""perfect angels"" who throw things on the floor, leave sticky drinks everywhere, and grab things that they shouldn't. I also can't tell you the amount of parents who have used their children to steal because ""they're innocent minors who clearly didn't realize they were stealing."" I get that sometimes babies grab things they shouldn't, but when a carriage goes off and we find 3 pairs of bras and 10 panties in with the child all of which are the same size and the same articles the mom was looking at earlier -- the coincidence of the situation is harder to buy.
