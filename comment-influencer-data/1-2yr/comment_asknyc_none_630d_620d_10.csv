"sometimes, i want pizza. other times, usually when drunk or stoned, i want dominos. the two are not the same. "
How-Ston. Anyone correcting you is wrong. 
"Homeless guy jacking it on the bench, woman walks down the stairs, sees him going at it and with a look that says I just got off a double shift, sits down 2 seats away and opens her book."
My rooftop is open for Indian strippers. Check it out on air bnb.
"I would have a whole brownstone in the West Village, no question. Or one of those historic houses that still has a yard."
"Honestly just drink a few gallons  of  water, crawl into a cramped closet with a freshly used turd filled, piss soaked litterbox, spill some skunky warm Steel Reserve all over yourself, and hold in your pee to unhealthy levels with pop music playlists playing in the background through a broken speaker, and you'll roughly have a slightly better time if you went to see the real deal.


You're not missing anything and nobody ever went to their death bed with not being in Times Square for NYE as their biggest regret.

"If you take the 2 train out to Brooklyn college, I feel like the further out you go, the more surprised she sounds, like who knew the train goes out this far?"
Movie and Chinese food right? That's common knowledge. 
"Let me tell you about my friend who bought a dog.

He could no longer join us for afterwork activities because he had to go home and walk his dog.  He could meet us after but that could require a 3 hour time gap in between.  

He constantly felt guilty about leaving his dog.  

Whenever he went on vacation he had to board his dog at a kennel.  He was an avid traveller, who stopped traveling.  He would take his dog to trips home.  This equaled to extra costs on flights.

His dog ripped up the hardwood floor in front of the door.  Like there is a huge hole.  He is hating the day he will move out.

You have to get up every morning, early (also meaning you have to come home every night) and take the dog out.  No matter how much rain or snow.  

If you work longish hours you will have to hire a daily dog walker.  For over a decade.  

His dog had a few emergency room escapades, all extending into the 4-digits.  

Owning an animal is a huge commitment, and owning a dog requires tons of effort.  It is one part of your life; you are its entire life.

That means you need to give tons of attention daily, and tons of time.  You need to shop for food.  You have to groom your pet.  You need regular vet visits.  You will be limited on where you can ever move in the future, etc.

If you are ready to ""settle down"" in life, go ahead, get a dog.

If you are wondering if it will ""limit"" your personal life, it will.  And it is super expensive.  

"
"""Non-touristy stuff""

""Hidden gems""

""We're coming into NYC to watch the ball drop on NYE, we've heard it's so cool! Is there a cheap place we can go with a good view? Preferable with cheap beer and Italian food, Indian strippers a huge plus!""

""I'm moving to Brooklyn, is it safe?""

""Where do you guys park your car?""

""I'm looking for a decent size apartment close to midtown for under $1k/month, any tips?""

Did I cover everything?"
"I'm a big fan of walking around the city by myself. If you prefer to be in nature though, it will suck."
"The day that I was the asshole that accidentally spilled two large iced coffees on a crowded subway car, totally drenching myself and hitting a few other people next to me.  Everyone scattered like roaches and I sat there, kind of stunned, just apologizing over and over. The only person that didn't move was an old hispanic woman next to me. She reached into her not extraordinarily large purse and pulled out an entire double-Bounty sized roll of paper towels and proceeded to blot me while kindly whispering ""is ok, Mami.  Don' worry. Is ok."" I hope I am never that asshole again, but I also don't know where else I would ever be blotted by a stranger carrying an abnormally large roll of concealed paper-towels. 

Before anyone asks- I had a carrying tray, the lids were not on the coffees well, I should have checked them but I did not.  The entire thing was in slow-mo when it happened. Never again."
"Been living here for over 20+ years. It’s not about who you are that should be your decision to live in NYC, it’s about the opportunity to do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING you think of. 

Want to go to bars? There’s a million with a unique theme. 

Want to stay home and game all day? There’s always a stable fast internet connection and at least 5 pizza places that will deliver. 

Feel a bit lonely and Want to meet people? There’s apps and events for any time of day. 

Feel like eating weird and exotic food? More places than you can count. 

Want to buy ethnic ingredients for cheap? You betcha. 

The list goes on. If you can think of it, NYC has it (ok minus stuff like off-road racing or skiing, but you get the point. Those activities are few and far in between that shouldn’t define your daily lifestyle). You don’t necessarily need to “take advantage” of what the city is known for, it’s really about the opportunity to be who you want to be and do what you want to do. "
Somebody stole my credit card info recently and tried to spend $70 at a Brooklyn Domino's before the bank recognized it was fraud and called me. I was mostly upset someone would spend that kind of money at a Domino's when they lived in Brooklyn...
"Lots of coupons, can order online, the Domino's Hawaiian Pizza reminds me of my dad bringing it home every other Friday when I was a kid. "
"How-ston, exactly like the city. "
"&gt;$50/night for NYE in NYC

Delusion"
That’s cool if you don’t mind living in an apartment that’s decorated like the inside of the Cheesecake Factory.  
Saw a hawk soaring through the air with a giant rat squirming in its claws.
"Domino's is in the same class as McDonald's.  If it's convenient and open late, it's an acceptable cheap option.  Sure a pie from Di Fara would be better, but at 2 AM when you're in midtown and the Domino's app is on your phone, why not?"
I’ve mentioned this before but watching two male ballet dancers having a pirouette-off on the corner outside the Ballet Hispanico on the UWS
"1, 2, 3, let's party, mother fucker

1st Ave, 2nd Ave, 3rd Ave, Lexington, park, Madison, 5th ave"
"Holding out for the ""details"" part of peoples' answers."
"I wouldn’t, but some people are fucking insane, so I’m sure someone will tell you it’s ok."
Almost certainly those basement apartments are illegal and that's why he's so weird about it  - he's terrified of being found out/fined/arrested. 
"This ones subtle but the first moment it really hit me just how ""New York"" New York really is was a subway car where I overheard Chinese, English, Spanish, and an eastern European language of some kind - not even a very crowded train, and not even in Manhattan, and still, 4 languages in one subway car. The linguistic diversity of this city is stunning and pretty unique. 

Also whenever everyone casually walks past a homeless man masturbating, that's very New York. "
"I would live [here](https://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/2546956) in this giant clock tower apartment. 

My main goal in life would be to eat at every great NYC restaurant. "
"If you have a 4 story brownstone in the West Village I think you could install a water filter on your upstairs bathroom sink no problem, or you could just drink the tap water like a normal New Yorker."
Asked for pretzel without first asking $. Paid tourist rate $5. Every other cart showed $2. Still can't sleep well.
"Pizza Food is my term for it.  It's like American Processed ""Cheese Food"".  No, it's not cheese, but it melts fantastically, and it's what I want on specific things.

Sometimes you want pizza food."
Its Howston. Both are named after different people who pronounced their last name differently.
"Domino's garlic buttered crust is just addicting, ok? "
and you don't have see 432 park
"3 bedroom apartment on the UWS, walking distance to the Met Opera.

Box tickets for the entire season.
Ubers everywhere. Grubhub every night. Weekly resident eater at Per se. 


Frequently rent out bars to host events and parties for my mates. "
"What's even stranger is flying to another country and hearing Carolyn Hopkins voice at both airports and then getting on another subway and still hearing her. 

She is the defacto American english voice now"
"The way she says Wall St in “The next stop is, **Wall St** makes me think silently, “Fuck yeah, New York”"
"My aunt: ""How can you go into the subway? It's disgusting!!!""

After traffic has come to a standstill and we're late to the very expensive musical, we go down into the subway and she holds the pole between her elbows. "
"I wait in the Strand by the architecture books and when someone comes to look at them, I kidnap them and hold them captive in my room where we talk about design non-stop until they escape. God I'm lonely."
"&gt;I wasn’t writing you a bed time story.

This fucking sub yo."
It's NYC. It will always be packed. Always. Forever.
"How-ston.

Anyone who says it's like the city doesn't know what they're talking about. The street is named for [William Houston](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-georgia), a founding father of Georgia, and it's how his name is pronounced. "
"$19.99 gets you 2 medium 2 topping pizzas, 16 piece order of Parmesan Garlic Bites, an order of Cinnamon-Twists, and a 2-liter of Coke. That’s why."
"Don't forget ""What's the best pizza place in NYC?"""
"Check hotels and Airbnb on LI. I wouldn't even bother with NYC - everything will be booked or incredibly expensive for Nye festivities here. 


If you're planning on coming into the city just use the LIRR to commute to and from. "
Refer to subway lines by color instead of the correct number or letter.
"What a shitty invitation!

Come visit us in fucking Long Island but we won't put you up. Theres nothing to do here except fart around st our house but again... You can't stay here.

Make your own arrangements.

That would be the fastest no thanks ever. "
