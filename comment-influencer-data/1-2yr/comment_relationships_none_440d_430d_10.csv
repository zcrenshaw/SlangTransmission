"Any reasonable person can understand basic budget constraints. 


""Sorry, babe, but it's not in my budget right now. I understand if you'd rather not get coffee/go out to eat/whatever in that case!"" "
"I might drop the ""you're dropping hints"" part. That may come off as a tad confrontational, or make her feel a bit desperate. I would try something like, ""The place we're going to is beautiful and romantic, and would be ideal for a proposal. I just want to let you know that I am not ready for that to happen just yet, mainly for financial reasons. I DO want to propose, I just want a bit more time to be prepared."""
Thank you. I will look into this. I'm looking up doctors that are on our insurance right now that I can talk to. I'm making appointments ASAP.
"now if he’s treating her badly, he’ll just know to hide it from you."
"&gt; It's really important to understand, the notion of being known/appreciated/embraced for who you are, particularly by someone who is nothing like you (ie across generations) is really a pretty new one. In days gone by, companionship within families took the form of passing time together on projects (fixing cars, needlework, etc), not in trying to get to know one another's inner selves.

Not trying to criticize your advice, because it sounds alright to me, but where are you getting this particular impression/bit of information? Because I can understand, like, medieval peasants not having time to exchange personality quizzes, but I also can't get behind the notion that families don't really know each other or care to know each other, at least as recently as the last couple centuries.

Edit: Downvotes for asking a polite question? Stay classy, relationships."

"When we get our bills, some of them are based on usage (gas, water, electricity) and some aren't (rent, Internet). 

I think all 5 of you should pay the fixed costs of rent, cable and Internet. As you say, it's a contract they entered into. 

When the utilities come, check the breakdown on the back. Usually the ""service charge/rates"" is about $100 and the usage $150 in my house. Split the service charge 5 ways and the usage 3 in my opinion. 

If your housemates don't want to pay this, then they should get someone in to sublet for a couple months. Or rent out their rooms on Airbnb lol. "
Don’t bother commenting if you’re not going to even read r and just make assumptions that could easily be answered by reading it. Ugh

"This is so fucking not right. This is so wrong on so many levels. You are not overreacting, she is taking advantage of you seems like you fascinate her in some ways, but THIS IS NOT PROFESSIONAL. Get yourself a new therapist and report her behavior immediately. "
"Doesn't mean she doesnt need it.
She has no life no friends shes far from everything she knows... and stays in bed all day watchung netflix? Sounds like depression to me.

He can ship her home if he wants to.
Or he can insist she get help."
"If they're selling the house then that means they should be fixing the dishwasher anyway. Any realtor would tell them that. If I were a potential buyer I would not be pleased if they said ""the dishwasher is broken so you'll have to fix it yourself."" If you're selling the house everything should be ready for the next residents. "
"There is one of two things happening here neither of which sound very appealing from your point of view.One,she is going home and telling her parents that you are fighting with her.This isn’t good in the long term because mom and dad won’t forget you made their little girl cry.Two,she’s not going home....."
"I think you’re convincing yourself that it must be your ex because you don’t want your current bf to be responsible. I can’t think of any reason why your doctor would reach that conclusion either. It doesn’t make sense that the reason he must be clean is that he didn’t have sex for 2 years, when the conclusion is that you got it a year ago or longer.

Hopefully once you’re both treated you’ll feel clean again."

"He was love bombing you after the incidents. You should read up on the cycle of abuse, you might find it useful. I think you should take as much time as you need to before entering a relationship with your father again (if ever). There is zero reason that you must decide now. Tell him “I am not ready to forgive everything that you did right now. Trust takes a long time to rebuild and I’m just not there yet”. If he doesn’t like that answer, well tough shit, his actions have consequences and he can just wait."
Only screened for viral STIs? I've never ever heard of someone getting an STI test that didn't include chlamydia... 
"She probably started it thinking that you would be reasonable and mature, but you demonstrated pretty quickly that you were unable to do so. You put too much pressure on her to put you first in a three-month long relationship and she probably got tired of having to manage your emotions on top of dealing with her own life. "
how is swiping a glass out of her hand so it breaks not violent? 
"It sucks, but you have to accept that you may never get the support you want from your mom and stepdad. Plan on moving out as soon as you legally can and start building your life without your family's support. They've made it clear that they've chosen their other children and with their decision, they've chosen to ruin their relationship with you. It sucks, but after you move out, you can start building a life on your own and build a family out of people who will actually support you."
"Why do you feel so distraught though? Is there some kind of regret you had with your ex? Despite the fact that he works for the ""sister company,"" I don't believe you should feel some sort of way. Cheer up, OP! Happy thoughts. Think happy thoughts!"
"I wouldn't ask someone to do me a favor, have then actually do it, and then not even use what they got me. It feels a little disrespectful imo. It's not even like she did it randomly for you out of nowhere and you didn't plan on it, you actually asked her to go out of her way for you. If it was me, I'd respect that.

Though you could always mention it to her to hear what she has to say about it."
"Not expressing an opinion either way but ""I snapped and told him that if he doesn’t want to have our marriage annulled, he will do this with me"" is in the main body of the post, it was definitely threatened."
"Ask the doctors and nurses to keep your parents away from you until you say so. 

You are 21, the hospital will respect your preferences (or they could get their asses handed to them by a lawyer). They'll refuse your parents access to you until you give the word.  They do this every day. This happens all the time (pushy MILs at births being a specialty!) Your parents don't NEED to be there, and don't have any automatic RIGHT to be there (whatever they may believe to the contrary, not even if they are paying for this)"
You're fucking loaded if that's true. shut up.
"I know you love your mom, but this behavior is really pathetic. Its childish pouting, its manipulative, its intentional guilt-tripping.  Months in a studio??? I couldn't deal with ""months"" in a huge house.  You've offered her very reasonable alternatives but her reaction to not getting EVERYTHING she wants in HER WAY is to burst into tears and made sad ""poor meeeeee"" remarks whenever she can slip theme in?

No.  No no no no no no.  Learn to stand up to your mom.  Its much healthier for you (and her) for you to be straight up and tell her to please stop crying, stop with the guilt and snide remarks, its unreasonable and you will not engage in this sort of behavior."
"Thats all great and fine, but I hope you dont wait  8yrs and a move across the country to tell your partner? "
"No is a complete sentence. So is, “ I can not accommodate that request.” "
"Can he agree to just drop this, even if he can't be dissuaded from his incorrect conclusions? Because otherwise I don't see how you can stay together, if he insists on trying to impose his reality onto you..."
She can't get grants because of her parents income and can't get loans on her own nor will anyone accept them as a cosigner. She's going to have to wait till her parents income don't  affect her anymore to get fasfa
"Or he’s just absolutely shameless and needs a new damn hobby. That is just so disrespectful of him, and pathetic. "
"If she's crossing boundaries that have already been drawn then you have every right to tell her off in public. Cancer or no cancer, she is being extremely rude and controlling. Here's what you say to her.

""MIL, you've been asked not to bring up us having kids. Since you continue to do it, I assume that you don't want to have any relationship with me at all. I will also assume that you don't want a relationship with any children I do have, as people who don't respect me and my boundaries will not get to meet my children.""

You don't have to be cruel about this, but you can be matter-of-fact and direct."
[deleted]
Agreed. The difference between my parents and OP is that my mom loves scratching my dads back. OP does not and if she doesn’t want to do it she shouldn’t have to 
"This sounds like the right approach if you don’t want to be dramatic. It ends things neat
And quickly. And honestly, from your first post - the relationship was already over and he’s a a low key jerk for not just ending the relationship before your grandfather’s passing. You put the effort in for be people you care about. "
"Honestly I have no idea why he would  even tell you this. He didn't do anything wrong, and telling you is a guaranteed way to make you feel insecure (as it obviously has). Most of my relationships in my 20's and 30's have a 'don't ask don't tell' policy about what happened before we were exclusive, because it's honestly not relevant to our relationship. At the point you become exclusive is when you decide to invest 100&amp;#37; of your dating energy into that one person, and although you were already doing that prior to it, that was your decision and your choice. That's completely fine, but you can't expect him to do the same if you haven't had the conversation.

I think he goofed up by telling you. I don't think that was necessary. But you need to decide if it's something you can get over or not, and if not you need to end it."
"'Their parents are letting them'

Maybe she should ring their parents and check 🤔

No really though. If he was 15/16 I'd say, why not - but have a curfew. 13 is way too young. It's too young to be left at home on your own! "
"It's amazing what you can do when it's your only option! Nobody just sits around, dreaming of living in a tiny, roach infested, overcrowded apartment! But sometimes that's all you can afford. And the fact that she thinks he doesn't need the money as badly as y'all do, knowing how he lives and what he's been through is astounding to me! I mean, that's your brother. If you're dad wasn't some Evangelical jerk, then presumably the inheritance would've been split evenly between y'all anyway, as it should be with siblings. So he was already screwed out of the money once when he hasn't done anything to your father to deserve it, and now your wife wants to screw him out of it AGAIN when he's done nothing to her to deserve that. And you guys have great income, job security, a great house with no mortgage and ample savings?? My God, maybe it's just me but this would actually have me rethinking my entire marriage. I'm appalled by your wife's callousness and I don't know that I could stay in the marriage while seeing my brother's life every day, knowing I could help it but being restricted from doing so. If you think you'll feel resentful going along with her decision then that may doom your relationship anyway, if giving him the money doesn't do it first."
"Everyone responding must not be married. Its kind of crazy. If you have joint finances, then this is a joint decision.

Every time someone posts an inheritance question on here, EVERYONE responds and says keep the money, because THAT IS WHAT THE PERSON WHO DIED WANTED!

It sounds like your brother chose an expensive degree that doesn't have a lot of career prospects. The fact that you would study something that costs 100K that can't find you a job anywhere but NYC is quite ridiculous. Just as ridiculous as the fact that he is CHOSING to live in Brooklyn, which is extremely expensive.

Point I'm trying to make is, your wife is right to be upset. I get that your brother has gotten the short end of the stick regarding the relationship with your dad, but your IMMEDIATE family, your wife and future child are #1. What if you lost your job? What if your child has health issues requiring long term medical care?

I would sit down with a financial advisor, review all of said circumstances, and reasses. Something to consider: you make significantly more than your wife; does this make her feel like she can't make purchases she really wants sometimes? Maybe a compromise would be 70k goes to her. She can save it, spend it, use it for the house, whatever, and you ""get"" the other 70k. And if you chose to give that all to your brother, than so be it? Either way, I'd honestly be pissed if my husband pulled this, so remember where your long term priorities lie."

This is an awesome and very practical advice :) I am going to try this today! Thank you!

"It’s a bad, but somewhat understandable, idea if it’s just joint checking, but the shared credit card/savings account is what propels this idea into the stratosphere of stupid."
"A baby shouldn't be born with a job.  The job in this case is to pass Grandma's genes on to another generation.  That's too much to put on a little baby.

Also, given OP's narrative, they're both young, marriage is new and there are still things to be worked out, job is physically stressful right now and they just plain aren't ready.  

OP, wait until you're both ready and in a good place to bring a little one into your family."
"Just thinking out of the box here; but would it make sense to help your brother with smaller payments on his loan? Like 500 a month or something? That way you have financial security for your family in case something bad happen, and it will still be a huge help to your brother. Also you wont really notice 500 in your position. Or like 10k down and then 500/m"
"You’re right, I didn’t think of that. That’s so sad.

OP, if losing this job is the price you have to pay to get away from this man — consider it a very cheap price."
"No, your girlfriend is being weird. Blow her mind and tell her about white girls you've had sex with."
"Wtf girl why are you dealing with this?! Where tf is your backbone I wouldn’t have done this when one night! Waking you up?! NO

He’s not HELPING you with chores he’s doing his very basic part in keeping a household together! Does he think you WANT to do chores?! He can’t eben cook dinner for you or order delivery so it’s there when you get home? With partners this selfish you’re better off single"
"Sure, but that assumes he would be WILLING to do that. Which is unlikely. "
"When you have in to the hug and he used that as an opportunity to grind on you, that’s what’s called **coercion**. It still wasn’t your choice to hug him, he took your choice away by wearing you down/leaving no way out for you. And it was definitely assault and indecent exposure. 

If your mom doesn’t believe you, there are others who will help you. You’re 18 right? So technically you can get out if you need need to. But t will be hard. There are shelters and I’m sure a friend or a family member would take you in. 

You could bring it up like this *”Hey mom can I tell you something that happened the other day when you weren’t here?”

And just say it exactly how you said it here. Read it off your phone if you have to do you don’t have to think of how to say it. Tell her exactly what you told us. 

Also, if you’re in the US, depending on what state, you may be able to record these conversations. Find out if your state is a one party consent state. So if he gets called out on it and he admits to it, then later denies it, you have proof. Hell, maybe talk to him about it first so you can show your mom that he admitted to it. 

It’s not going to be easy. But your safety is worth it. "
"Honestly I think this is way too nice OP this dude is an asshole. I'd just push the blame lol. ""I don't feel like you support me or fulfill me so I'm going my own way."" ""This past week has made me realize what kind of boyfriend you are""

It's over and I know the more mature thing is a peaceful message lik the one I'm responding to but yknow if it's done, why not express your damn feelings. He hasn't let you this whole damn time. I'd get it off my chest"

"As is mine, as is mine."
"Yeah no. Sorry, but no one in their right mind defines ""ex"" as someone a person slept with one time years ago.

Edit: additionally, policing someone's time spent on Facebook, monitoring their interactions - that is not a healthy or acceptable boundary and is not in any way similar to smoking."
"Being a friend with an ex does not affect your health, there is no smell that you have to deal with nor is there an expense associated with it. 

Your analogy sucks

The only reason you would not want an SO to be friends with an ex is because you don't trust them. If there are other reasons that don't boil down to that issue, please enlighten me. 

You are taking this woman to task when it doesn't seem like she has done anything wrong other than go against your arbitrary rule. I get why you are presenting it this way because you are in denial of how bad you are looking through this. Let's take your rules to the logical conclusion, you should break up with her since you can't be with someone who is still facebook friends with an ex. 

You made the rule, now follow it  "
"Here's the thing, OP, the reason he is chasing all these women is because he is not happy or content with himself. There is an unhappy void in his core that he is trying to fill with sexual gratification and validation. He doesn't feel good about himself if he is not working towards bedding a new sexual partner, because when he does not have that distraction, he is forced to sit with himself and his root unhappiness, whatever that is.

He is not in a healthy place on which to build a lasting, trusting relationship with you, because he does not have a good relationship with himself. You sticking it out to ""help him through it"" is most likely going to end in a broken heart for you, simply because there is nothing for you to do here. HE needs to come to a place of inner peace before he can be a good partner for you.

Your head is correct here: you need to distance yourself from him. Hopefully he gets it together (maybe you breaking things off will be the catalyst, who knows) and y'all can reconnect in the future, but I don't see anything changing magically in the meantime, and you are heading straight for worse and worse heartache."
"\&gt;  My bf can be blunt and callous 

So, he is an asshole then, who ""tells it like it is""?  Yeah...nobody likes that kind of person.  You Dad doesn't like him, your BIL doesn't like him, your sister doesn't like him.  He quits jobs without something else lined up.  You admit he is callous.  

\&gt;  Basically, I’d like some advice on how to handle when your family doesn’t like/approve your SO 

You maybe take some time to think about why the people who love you most, disapprove of an admittedly assholish guy.  Is that really who you want as a life partner?"
"Where did she say that? She said her privileges were restricted, not that she didn't have them at all. "
"This quote really stood out to me too, and OP if you do decide that separating is the right thing for you, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take time for yourself and discovering what YOU want. Many people who have been conditioned like this (16 years of this crap?!) seek relationships similar to abuse they've endured, because they've become dependent on that sort of relationship. It's very relieving to know you're seeing a therapist, and I implore you to continue treatment after (if) you decide to end it. 

The way he's treating you is manipulative and abusive, you shouldn't live like this in a happy relationship."
"This is a genuine question that I truly believe is important for diagnosing this situation. Maybe someone else can phrase it better, but this is what I've got right now.

Is your husband an idiot?

What I mean by that is would he walk up to his boss and muse about how much better the company would be if he was running things? When he's a dinner guest, would he tell the host how much better the food would be if he had cooked instead?

If he's an idiot, then this may be a bit on you. You knew what you were getting into and he may not ever come out of his own head. You'll have to assess what you can live with in that case.

If he's not - if he can have words in his brain, hear how they sound, and react accordingly - then I'm totally with you that he showed you his hand, either on purpose or accidentally. You're allowed to have this be a deal breaker. 
"
"Couples counseling, immediately. "
I agree on this one. Many suicidal tendencies arise out of not feeling welcome and safe at home.
"Fair enough--I just feel like using terms like that is what people with this ""condition"" do to excuse their behavior and make it seem like it's just one of the reasons they're smarter than/superior to everyone else. Meanwhile they're just being shitty and refusing to change."
"for what it's worth i think you handled this situation pretty well. we're all still young and figuring shit out, like you said it's your first relationship and you were lonely, but YOU were able to realize when you made a mistake and stepped past your personal boundaries and made good choices afterwards. yeah, you might have invaded on your sister's privacy a bit. maybe you were dating a creep. but you realized it and stood up for yourself afterwards. you're young and i guarantee you learned important from this interaction. so don't be too hard on yourself. in 2 weeks this experience will have no impact on your life whatsoever."
"""Her and her boyfriend, whom she met around the time of this post, just put an offer on a house""


and that, kids, is how I found out my roommate was batshit crazy "
"You should crush her in whatever sport you two play. 

"
"Yeah but it also serves as a parenting lesson.  Rather than taking the kid to therapy, say “you didn’t take care of the rabbit so we found a home where it’s happy and that’s why you aren’t getting another pet until you’re more responsible.”, not “let me reward you for not taking care of the rabbit.”"
"Chiming in on this part. I went through a traumatic experience with an ex before and absolutely felt trauma bonded. But that's all it was, a bond because of trauma we experienced together. 


I was able to process and work through my trauma eventually by separating myself from him and realizing it was my trauma and his trauma not our trauma. I went to therapy and found support from others who experienced the same. You can bond with a support group but it's much different than suffering a trauma with somebody. "

"You need to leave this guy in the rear view mirror. He’s extremely manipulative and controlling. Almost borderline dangerous. “He won’t let me break up with him.” He doesn’t have a choice in the matter. Don’t stay with him bc sometimes he’s fun and bc he’s there. You deserve so much better. Seriously, run. “Dump” him by completely removing him from your life and making sure he can’t contact you.  "
"You do not have to tell your grandma. Tell your parents - or ONE of your parents, the one you think will handle it better than the other - and let them help you decide on your best course of action. 

He should not be asking you to sleep over at their house, especially in a private conversation. It would be different if he were talking about it in front of your parents and the rest of your family. 

You're allowed to tell him that he's making you uncomfortable when he does things like this. And you're allowed to say ""you're making me uncomfortable and I'm going to walk away from you now"" and then do it. 

Getting into your bed with you is completely unacceptable. 

I'm very sorry he's been behaving this way. You don't deserve it. "
It’s rude. Regardless of intent it’s rude and should stop. Just stop offering. People like this need to learn that invitations stop if they don’t engage. 
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

No."
And you believe her after the timeline of events that just happened to you? 
"Because she was lonely and the guy probably validated her. It’s why long distance usually goes so bad, it’s easy to say “distance is nothing when we love each other”  but being alone living like a monk in your 20s is pretty shitty when it comes down to it. "
"Ok, after edit 2, when he tries to contact you again tell him to fuck off. But Also, this is your answer hun. He was using you, whether it was because he was cheating on someone else or not, he was straight up using you. YOU ARE WORTH SO MUCH MORE THEN THAT. Don't ever let him drag you down again."
"Thanks, the consensus seems to be to tell my boss so I'll call him tomorrow (he works weekends) and let him know what's going on. 
"
"&gt;""Yeah...but this has to be done""

Okay, so which projects can I drop or postpone or give to Alice?"
"About five years ago, I introduced my best friend to a newer friend of mine that had recently joined our social circle. Eventually they became boyfriend and girlfriend, moved in together, and just celebrated 4 years as a couple a few months ago.

Last year, the boyfriend and told me he wanted to propose in her favorite country on the planet (Greece), and so I was tasked with making a trip just the three of us sound like it was totally my idea. It took some convincing, but we finally all agreed to the trip and he is going to propose to her at the top of a mountain.

To make things even more spectacular, I ended up meeting my boyfriend at the end of last summer. He is a wonderful, well-traveled man who loves to eat and drink and go on adventures and has agreed to fly across the planet with me to witness two of my best friends get engaged. We travel together often and make an excellent team with a great balance for organization and planning (me) and confidence and familiarity for travel while maintaining an ""everything's going to work out"" mentality (him). So happy to have finally found my true other half after nearly 30 years.

We leave on Sunday and I am already peeing my pants in excitement, you guys."
"&gt; Should I end this sooner rather than later?

Yup.

You two are in different stages in life.  You're just starting out and he's likely ready to start settling down.  That's a fundamental incompatibility, and it likely means that it's not going to work out.  It's better to do it now rather than prolong the inevitable."
"By not doing the work, your manager could start to see YOU as the problem child.


I realize you don't want to look for a new job, but your manager has no reason to force Alicia to do work while you're around.  


This happened to me in my old office as well.  And when I left, then they split my entire job to TWO people.  I was pissed. "
What if I'm bisexual? Can I not have friends anymore?
You do not have to babysit if you don't want to.  You already have plans this weekend so you have a built-in excuse.  Simply tell her that you already have plans for the weekend and that you are unable to babysit.  No need to give further explanation than that.  If she continues to try and guilt-trip you simply restate that you already have plans and will not be cancelling them. 
"...ah yes, *that* view. By that definition, as a bisexual person I am currently in an emotional affair with every single one of my friends"
"You didn't agree to the part time work or the freelance research.

I think you should think about what you want your ideal married life to look like before you talk to him.  Is it just more time with him, or is it also a more equitable division of chores; what happens if/when you have kids; are you going to be able to go back to grad school or take a couple years off and he takes care of everything - financially and all the household chores?  There's a fine line between being supportive and just a doormat for whatever he chooses."
I hate when posters ignore the comments.
i dont think you are doing anytrhing wrong its just that the demographic you are interested in is VERY VERY small. A lot of people are not really interested in engaging couples. I had a lot of threesome myself but never looked for people only for that purpose.
Read OP's post history and you'll come to the conclusion he is the child in this relationship 
But that’s really not a good thing though. You can show him this to proof there’s another person that said it’s not ok to treat you like that. 
"You have already told your manager about the situation. Are you in a union, or otherwise have good job protection? I think you need to make him understand everything is not fine. I personally would call in sick a few days, because at this rate you will burn out sooner rathe than later. 

A milder version of calling in sick is to stand up for yourself more when work is pushed on you; okey I can take on her task/x project, but then this will not get done."

"Think of it as a $3k, 6 month course in ""getting back into the dating scene""

"When I was in graduate school for statistics, two of my professors were married to each other and about a year after I started the program, they ended up separating because they felt like they were each other's competition. During their years together, they did collaborate on multiple studies and published numerous research papers, but, eventually, they ended up disagreeing on their ideologies and it blew up in their face. It should be noted they both also had *serious* egos, particularly the husband, who thought he was God's gift to statistics."
"But she might think ""Well, I'm not going to go out of my way to do it for this person again""

Because it comes across as using your friend as a way of hooking up your other friends.

She can avoid making her unhappy by taking advantage of the nice gesture that was offered to her by her friend.

This is like politeness 101"

Chinese woman here. Asians can have natural eyelid folds. It's not that we want to look white at all. Certainly we don't want huge noses or stronger brow bones since that looks more masculine. But thanks for misinforming everyone Asians want to look white. Oh and I was born with my eyelid folds. Everyone in my family has them.
"&gt;a) get over being resentful about his career choices and their impact on our relationship


I'm not entirely sure you *should* get over it. I think this resentment is a natural consequence of what's happening, and I think it's an important warning sign that there is a major problem that needs to be addressed. You don't ask how to get over the pain of a broken arm; you ask how to heal the broken bone. 


&gt;b) have a productive discussion with him about this without it turning into a rant about feeling alone and like a mistress in my own marriage?


I have found a few important factors for me personally in communicating well. That doesn't mean they'll work for you, but they might give you some starting points.


One, I give my partner a head's up about what I want to talk about and schedule it. That way, he has some time to think through what he wants to say and that way we ensure we have a calm time set aside. ""Husband, I'm feeling really resentful over the lack of time we have together and the amount of work I have to do to support our lives. Can we talk about this on Friday afternoon? It's important to me to set specific time aside for this.""


I also script our my most important points. I revise them during a calm time to ensure I'm being clear and honest, but not mean. So you might have points like:


* Our relationship is suffering badly because we have no time together. This is serious enough to undermine the marriage. I am at the end of my rope, and I cannot go on like this. We need to make major changes to our lives to prioritize the relationship or it won't survive.


* It is not sustainable for me to continue to do the amount of work I'm doing around the house. I need you to be able to help with the chores and with caring for the dog. I need you to be a part of our lives in a tangible way. Let's talk about the changes we can make to have that happen.


* I am carrying a lot of negative emotions about the fact that we've gotten to this point. I feel like I am the last priority to you, I feel resentful that I am lonely in the marriage, and I feel disrespected and hurt. 


Make sure you have productive solutions at hand as well. Think about how things can be fixed and talk to him about that. Since time is the key here, you should figure out how to carve out more time.


Practically, it seems to me like what he needs to do is either quit the part time job if finances allow, or quit the freelance research work, or both.


If he refuses - if he is not open to compromising - you should be ready to lay out clear consequences for that.


""I need you to acknowledge that this is fundamentally damaging our marriage. I can't count on you to be my partner anymore and I can't trust you to prioritize our relationship when it's in danger. I'm going on this trip alone, since you won't be present with me if you have work. During that week, I'm going to be seriously thinking about where I can be in a marriage like this. You should know that I might decide that I can't."" "
"I can totally relate, but I can’t even fathom a dry spell of 4 months! I thought I’d lose my mind waiting for the all clear after our last baby was born.  The OP sounds a lot like me.  We had to “try” for a couple of months with our second child, and I was beyond satisfied, I would have been content to “try” for years.  Now, I’ve had to come to grips with the fact that my wife just doesn’t work  like I do when it comes to sex.  I try not to let it get me down.  She’s a beautiful person, an awesome Mom and the woman I love. Sometimes, “for better or worse” may mean less sex, less personal time, less health, less money.... 
That’s marriage.  


That being said, here’s what I’ve found dealing with my own overcharged libido.  

Be honest about what you’d like, and look at any factors that could help your cause.  

Is your wife on meds (esp the pill), anti-depressants, etc? Meds and birth control can significantly impact libido.  

Is she stressed?  Stress is a huge libido killer.  You might be able to take some of her burdens and a less stressed mate, could mean more interested (wink, wink)
Ex- she comes home to a clean house, laundry done, dinner taken care of, babysitter for the kids, and a romantic evening planned.  Yes, this might require more work on your part, but these simple things could be why your wife feels tired, instead of burning with desire.  

Are you or your wife significantly out of shape?  Physical fitness is good for your heart and your sex life.  If you’re both out of shape, get back in shape together.  My wife generally wants sex more when we’ve been spending quality time together.  Working out together is a great way to improve your intimacy mentally.  

Don’t forget about hygiene.  Manscaping can sometimes be a factor.  Remember, you want her to want you.  

Diet?   Are you guys eating crap?   A better diet could help libido.  

Kids?   See the note about stress.  Less stress = more booty. 

Trauma?   Anything in her past that’s make sex psychologically painful on some level.  Never underestimate the power of some couch time and professional help getting past those feelings.

"This may be bonkers but I find I get much, much better at understanding people with accents when I watch a television show with a character with that accent with the closed captions on so I can initially be reading what they're saying when I miss something.

Perhaps consider a show or a movie with a character or characters speaking english with similar accents?"
"Have you had a serious conversation with her about this? Have you asked her how she feels about hanging out with your daughter? How she feels about kids? How she feels about being a potential co-parent or step mother? Communication is the key. 

Ultimately your daughter should be your priority.  "
"Yes to this a hundred times over. You don't owe your mom anything, OP!"
"Maybe a marriage counselor?

Was your sex life every healthier than it is now? If so, there might be more going on."
"There are no other reasons given, either. But stealing and wearing others peoples underwear is very strange and inappropriate behavior for a 15 yo girl.

This is a big enough issue that the girl's parents should handle it, not OP by trying to gross the sister out. Because if that would work, it would have worked already."
"I would wait until after the party just so you don’t have to make up some lies or reasons that this would happen/if your bf wanted to read the message for himself. I’m 100% for open honesty, so you should definitely tell him, but since you didn’t do anything wrong, I think it’s best to wait until after his birthday so it doesn’t make things awkward. "
"&gt;If you knew there was an end date would that make it more tolerable?

I am extremely doubtful: Even without claustrophobia and anxiety, my work station requires a certain amount of space for equipment and materials which at present already nearly fills the room it's all in NOW. So either I find other living arrangements, or I'm unemployed and miserable."
"Do not take her computer and do not remove her door. That only makes the situation worse, trust me, she's gonna rebel more and she will be highly upset. I know for sure if I was in that situation I'd despise my parents for doing that and would do whatever to stay away from my family. That person did not give good advice at all. Give your child space and time. Don't try to force her to stop misbehaving. She will stop on her own terms. Leave her alone"
The sister regularly steals and breaks into locked rooms. I don’t see her spending her own money. Especially with the mom taking her to Goodwill - seems like the family doesn’t have much funds to spend on clothes.
"This might be me jumping to a conclusion, but the amount of emphasis put on you losing says quite a lot about how he sees ""conversations"" between him and you going. I think you need to have a sober discussion of this behavior. Ask him if there is honestly anything he is missing in your relationship. Then make a hard boundary that you're not going to have serious discussions with him when he's drinking. "
"I honestly don't know about this one. On the one hand I totally empathize with you and have been through similar periods with my own spouse, and on the other hand, I know that making someone be responsible for your emotional wellbeing by demanding sex is pretty coercive.

So I think the answer here is to tell him that you have noticed the drop in sexual frequency and quality and that that makes you unhappy and you would like it to change. But leave out the ""I'm going to go nuts / can't function without sex and you must do me or my misery is your fault"" kind of talk. One is simply stating your case, the other is manipulative. "
"There’s also the idea that if you don’t feel up to doing “normal” things during pregnancy, or if you’re taking extra steps to protect yourself, you’re some sort of whiny hypochondriac.  No, I don’t care that you worked a physical labor job throughout your pregnancies.  No, I don’t care that you ran marathons throughout your pregnancy and gave birth at the finish line while finishing first (of course!).  It still won’t make my fatigue go away.  "
"You didnt let yourself get taken advantage of, that's 100% on him. I am glad you recognize it, but I certainly don't want you to blame yourself for it. "
"&gt;In my previous sex life, I’ve enjoyed rough, wild sex but I also associate that with flings &amp; don’t feel comfortable to show that side to me when we have sex.

What is the deal with this mindset? Why in the world *wouldn't* you want to have the kind of sex you enjoy so much with the man who actually means something to you? It makes no sense at all. And if you're thinking ""I don't want him to think less of me"" or whatever, then let me tell you this: just about every man wants a woman who is a prude with other men and a freak with him. Being a prude with him and a freak with other men does nothing but hurt him and deprive you. "

"Sorry, I know how hard it is to come to the internet seeking someone to validate your feelings and take your side, but your friend isn’t totally in the wrong. If you’re not happy with the friendship/continuously spending money that you don’t have/ get little effort in return, stop initiating. Stop picking her up. And while FWB isn’t exclusive,  a true friend wouldn’t hook up with someone they know you’re into. But at the same time, you told her you’d rather it be him than her ex. While I can pretty much see that you obviously were making an exaggeration, she took it literally. I’d say cut your losses and focus on friendships/relationships that are a better fit for your needs. 

Edit: also, she ghosted him because you told her you were upset. If your fwb is upset about that, he’s obviously into her as well. If you’re looking for exclusivity, he might not be that guy. 

Edit: also, to answer your actual question.. go, be cordial and mature. If you think the friendship is worth salvaging, try to privately talk to her about it. If not, enjoy the other company you’ll be with, but I wouldn’t make a big deal about this. "

"Sometimes, it takes an event, even a small event to make you realize you are unhappy. I was at a job for almost a decade. I was convinced that I was happy in this job, that I loved this job. There were things that bothered me about management but I was okay with it because I loved this job. Then, one day there was a job posting for the only other employer I had ever really considered working for. I looked at that job posting rather regretfully. Somehow, just considering working for this other employer opened my eyes to how much I was suppressing about how truly unhappy I was in my job. I didn’t end up applying for that job. But, the damage was done. The scales fell away from my eyes and I realized that I didn’t love my job, that I was miserable. Suddenly, everything at the job made me unhappy. I could no longer even pretend to myself that I loved this job. I started job hunting and a year later I left my employer and started a new job. I have no regrets. 

The point of all of this is that sometimes you can go from thinking everything is fine and dandy to realizing it really isn’t in a very short time period. All it takes is an eye-opening experience. It sounds like your conversation about the texts and your husband’s realization about how much he valued this co-worker opened his eyes to a lot of unhappiness he has with your relationship. You should definitely take him seriously. 

Also, I have anxiety and, while there is definitely a chemical component, there is more often a situational component that drives it. It is very possible that his unhappiness is not *because* of his anxiety. His anxiety is *because* of his unhappiness. Knowing how unhappy I was in my job and feeling trapped there really exacerbated my anxiety. It wasn’t the anxiety that caused the unhappiness, though. "
"My mother in law is a hoarder, and when her kids moved out she ramped it up.  Over the last 40 years she has accumulated so much junk in her house (and also her deceased mothers house next door) that both places are almost inhabitable.  It’s impossible to keep a house full of crap clean, and there are bugs and rodents in both.  She recently almost killed herself using a filthy c-pap machine.   I wish we had intervened 40 years ago when this started but we didn’t.  Now we are facing the fact that it will be up to us to clean up her mess when she dies, which could be soon given her age.  Give that some thought - it would be better to be honest now than have it be an aggravation later. "
"Studies show this not to be true. The younger they are (besides being infants,) they cannot understand why the separation has happened and if the child is being bounced back and forth between homes, that constant change in routine is quite jarring to a 3 yr old, versus an 8 yr old who understands basic relationship concepts and that when their parents aren't together anymore, they're going to be in two households. 

What there ISN'T information on is the effect of divorce on older children: preteen to preadulthood. I was 22 when my parents divorced. If given the choice, I would have rathered they divorced when I was younger, living in that household has really caused significant damage. This is anecdotal, just my experience."
Do you have any family/friends you can stay with? 
"Of course she's hesitant to say when she's free, she's probably scared to talk with you now cause she's confused as hell. Also idk if anybody else has mentioned this, but the fact that she's ghosting the guy seems like she's trying her best to rectify things the only way she can think of. She slept with him, you're mad, she tried to get in touch with you, you're still mad, so she's cutting the guy off to try to not further complicate things with you. Also as far as making dinner goes, did you ever ask her to contribute? I know it shouldn't be necessary but some people need the reminder. Like ""hey, I'll pick you up if you grab groceries and then we can cook together"" something like that. Stop bottling up the things that bother you and expecting people to read your mind. I'm even confused af reading this. Lol"
"I see people in this sub talk about counseling a lot and I’m sure I does fix a lot but as OP is working 60 and doing school, his wife is doing 40 and caring for a child I think that might be a luxury of money and time that might be out of their range?

My wife and I don’t have kids and hold down decent jobs and I doubt we could afford it looking at the rates that come up on a quick search.

Assuming that they don’t have access to a free religious opinion (I know those are out there and if OP is part of a community like that they should check it out) it would be great if some people could recommend low cost resources for people who want to do the work on their relationships but who don’t have the disposable income."

Don't tell your boyfriend, best case scenario he'll try and talk you out of it,  worst case scenario he'll hurt you or worse. Do not try and get your stuff without someone you trust to accompany you.

"When I was dating an ex, she randomly decided that she wanted to dedicate an entire day to me, without directly saying the whole day was dedicated to me. It was one of the sweetest things anyone has ever done for me. I slept over at her place the night before. Woke up in a way that most men would love to wake up. Neither of us worked that day, so she got me some of my favourite alcohol and we started our day with breakfast and a couple of day drinks. After that we just spent some time together in the afternoon. I thought all the surprises were over with, and I was fine with that because they were more than enough. Little did I know she had organized a night for me to hangout with some of my buddies from high school that I haven't seen in quite a bit due to life getting in the way (school, work, relationships etc).

"If you and your fiance are currently on the same side about not having his parents visit there's not much to be gained from changing your minds.  If you don't want to tell them the true reason about you feeling that way, make up some excuse that will keep them from visiting your apartment.  If they push you on it, tell them that since you and your fiance aren't married yet you aren't allowing parents into your home until after the ceremony."

"He should pay for a place that belongs to you because people have to pay rent for where they live? I really don't understand this. Why should she live for free?

For OP (and maybe you in the future? idk) it seems like a good compromise to rent the house he already owns and perhaps rent a DIFFERENT place together, that no one owns, until they are ready to buy something together.

I owned my home and when my boyfriend moved in, he paid me rent (although it was not half the mortgage, it was less) because there's no reason he should live somewhere for free, and he understood this. It was a good deal for both of us - his rent was lower, and my burden was also lower, as it should be since I was sharing my space."
"I don't think you are wrong morally but I wonder if practically this could be difficult/bad for OP. I

OP says the dog is chipped, the owner knows she wants to remove it, the owner knows she wants to send it to uncle's farm, and the owner wants $500 out of her. Also, given the owner is basically blackmailing OP over a dog he's neglecting he's clearly a pretty shitty guy and we can't just assume will be forgiving or let this go.

OP can't take this pet to a shelter ect (unless he could somehow remove the chip first?) as they will return the dog to the owner and he may well even find out OP gave it to them. Also, it seems like she can't just give it to uncle since the dog is chipped, OP is the only one who takes out dog, and the owner knows she wants to give it to uncle. So wouldn't it be really easy for her to get caught? Owner could go to the farm and find the dog there himself and call the police, or maybe even call the police first? 

Also, how does reporting lost and stolen dogs work? Even if OP manages to smuggle dog off to uncle and owner doesn't find it where OP said she would take the dog, what would happen when uncle takes the dog to the vet? Would they read the chip and return the dog? Then owner would be pretty clear on the theft. 

How much trouble can OP get in? Could she be arrested? What's her risk here? "

"Maybe I'm reading too much into this because of your name being silentwife, but you brought up not being able to talk to your husband about basic parenting concepts like ""if one of our kids needs more, we will give them more"" because fair does not mean equal. 

Is communication a problem for him in all areas of his life, or just with his mom, brother and you? Because frankly, that seems like a lot of areas, and you have a kid with this person (and are planning on more). He needs to get some therapy/counseling. "
"Here, what I could deduce from the little information OP gave:
  
&gt; We've never been able to have children (...). Both of us wanted to be parents.
  
&gt; Like any couple, especially one that's dealt with pregnancy loss, we have our hard moments. There's silent dinners, nights where we aren't even in the same room, times when we can't bring ourselves to touch each other.
  
&gt; He said he's compromised so much for me, that I have to do the same for him.  
  
1) Both of them wanted children.   
2) They lost a pregnancy.  
3) Resulting in either the impossibility or unwillingness to try again.  
4) Husband says he compromised a lot to stay with OP.  
  
My read: OP can't or won't have children, husband could but decided to stay with his wife (a huge compromise).   
As usual, making such a huge sacrifice created resentment (silent dinners, etc...), further exacerbated by the appearance (to him) of OP being willing to care for everyone and everything besides HIM. "
"We have been together for 8 years, married for 2. Sometimes I use uncommon words but I don’t think any of the words that he pointed out were difficult. I also don’t use sophisticated language that much at home. I mostly use it at work. 

I’m sure his family has said something to him. They rant to him about my degree and my job all the time. They don’t understand why I couldn’t get a “normal job” because “why would anyone want to go to school for longer than necessary???”  My husband has his master’s but they don’t have a problem with that."
"Something along those lines, I'm guessing. Some emasculation issue, most likely, hence he's reverting to his family's dumbass macho (and probably sexist) attitudes for reassurance"

"Thanks for making this distinction, it's a really important one. The more I've read comments on here, the more I think it's a crowding/space thing (which feels insane since the apartment is a 1,200sqft 2BR 2BA). I left a &lt;700sqft 3BR 1.5BA apartment that had 5 people living in it and was so excited to finally have just ONE roommate when moving into this 2BR. So now that I have this unofficial 3rd roommate that was not part of the plan, I definitely feel that's more of the case (I was used to being crowded and this place was supposed to be my freedom/escape from that). I agree with what you say, that asking to pay is legitimizing her being there and as such for me to ultimately feel better I think it's a time in the apartment/right of access issue."
"&gt; he said ok in front of the therapist, but later told me that it's not acceptable.

That's really not a good sign. If she's going to lie in front of the therapist then she doesn't really want to stop which means she's not going to. Do you want to live with this for the rest of your life?"
Exactly. Classic projection 🙄. She wants to take advantage so naturally she accuses OP of trying to take advantage 😑. I can’t stand these kinds of people

"I’ve never telecommuted, but I have worked night shift. I learned the unfortunate lesson that people understand on a surface level night=work, day=sleep, but it is very difficult to understand it psychologically. Day=awake for the vast majority of people, for their entire lives, so it was hard for my family to break the habit of day=awake, therefore, my day=sleep, meant =lazy to them, therefore be as passive aggressively loud as possible to get at me. Unfortunately, I don’t have advice for how to break that, because I switched to day shift in large part because of this issue. Also unfortunately, I get instinctively angry when I’m woken unwillingly to this day because of it. 


But I can easily see where OP’s wife has a similar psychological block, where she believes Home=free, therefore OP is being mean/standoffish, whathaveyou. OP did well establishing a separate workspace and a strict schedule to start off with (he definitely should stop being so flexible until wife can get it). Now he just has to get wife to understand. They need to talk, but hell if I know what to say."
"&gt; I know a lot of women who do their husband's and children's laundry AND fold it

Those people are probably doing all the laundry because it's one of their designated chores. Their husbands (and possibly children) likely have designated chores of their own that they do. These womens' relationships are probably (hopefully) not as one-sided as yours is."
"yeah, definitely getting to the root of the problem would be great. really tease out the issues at hand.

i also think it's really important to point out the differences in circumstances too: you and your husband are older and obviously in a more stable and secure situation than your BIL was when he and his wife got pregnant considering they were very young.

not having kids sooner means perhaps your husband missed out on free childcare, but it's the trade off for bringing a child into the world when you're older and more established."
"Before I clicked, I thought, ""Oh.  That could be sweet.  He wants to give her his undivided attention.""  But after I read, his habits have changed, and that's shady as hell.  I'd be suspicious."
"How many people would change their wedding dates for 1 person?

Not saying anything on their relationship because I agree with you on it, but not many people would change a large event they have been planning for one person.

That includes changing the ceremony date and time (if available), the venue if available, the caterer, the honeymoon.  All for one person."
"Don’t stay in a relationship because you *hope* your partner will change. ”If he only realised...” ”If he only stop doing this...” ”If he only change that...” If only, then you’d be happy! But it’s not healthy to be unhappy and put all chances of happiness on someone else.

Especially if they are showing they your happines is not a priority for them!

It should also be noted that your boyfriends issues are not small issues. He have unhealthy views about women that he has been taught to believe aince childhood and that he has continued to belive. You have already alterered you life in significant ways to accomidate his beliefs. He sincerly believes you will continue to do so. Now he is moving closer to even more toxic views on women in talking about wanting to be closer to his extremist family and how he wants you to accomidate their extremist beliefs. Your boyfriend has been quite clear what his expectation of you are, and has stood by them firmly and is even escalating, so your hope that he will suddenly want to swing around and adopt a completly different set of beliefs is unrealistic. You are staging your schooling, job, and relationship on a hope he will suddenly change something he doesn’t want to change about himself. That’s not going to end well.

Lastly, your boyfriend has expressed a wish to become closer to his extremist family who has a lifestyle you could not possibly fit into and at the same time is dialing down his commitment to you? It’s seems extremly likely that your boyfriends is starting to realise that he can not have his families approval and a relationship with you at the same time, and he is already angleing to favor his familys approval. The risk of him dumping you soon seems high tbh.

You can ask him how he sees becoming closer to his family effecting his relationship with you, especially considering how deeply his family dissaproves pf you and how deeply you dissaproves of his familys values. Listen carefully to his answer, and if itks a lot of talk about how his family relationship is important to him and not abput how he is his own person that won’t just adopt their views again and thay he will priroritise making it work with you and protecting you from his family, then it’s a good indication that your relationship won’t survive him seeking to return to his family cult."
"You don’t want children, you don’t believe in women being subservent, and you’re jewish. Those are things that means that with you as his wife he will never get the approval of his Quiverfull family. Him getting his families approval and him being in a relationship with you are not possible atthe same time.

That he is talking about wanting to be closer to his family and talking about not being sure about his commitment to you is him *realising* those things are not possible together. He tried to figure out a way to have both by figuring out a way to make you more appealing to his family. Then he simply stepped back from commitment to you. So he is gearing up to choose his family over you.

To be clear, for him to be a part of him family again he must marry a subservant woman who will give birth to many children, meaning he must breakup with you first as you are not that women. If he chooses his family, then you are out. How likely do you think it is that he will choose his family right now?"

"&gt; Even after the children become adults, parents have absolutely zero legal right to ask their children to pay them back

They have the legal right to ""ask"" (or I guess, sue) for their children to pay them back. They have the legal right to ask/sue for literally anything they can think of. The problem is that if they try to, a court won't find there to be have been an agreement on the part of the child to pay anything back since, first and foremost, the child didn't choose to be born, and second of all, a minor can't enter into a contract like that even if, somehow, the parents got the child to ""agree"" to pay them back in the future. In fact, a court would not find in the favour of the parents even if their adult child agreed to pay them back NOW. As in, if OP turned round and said ""sure, I'll pay you back"" because that wouldn't constitute a contract. A contract requires consideration (an offer of something, basically) on both sides and it comes back to the above issue - even if the child is an adult now, the ""consideration"" offered by the parents (their parental care and the expenses that incurred) was one that was provided years before, without the child's permission (again, since they didn't choose to be born) and before the child could have legally consented to receiving it.

As for more recent expenses incurred by the parents on behalf of the adult child, unless the agreement to repay them was made before the parents incurred the expenses, it'd be supremely difficult to argue that it constitutes a legally binding contract even now, especially if the expenses were incurred years before.

And even then, that's all separate from the moral discussion of whether people *should* pay their parents back for raising them. And that's something that individuals need to make their own decision about. But as above, even if they decide that they have a moral obligation to, there's not going to be a legal one.

TL;DR they can ask to be paid back but unless OP decides to do it of their own volition, there's no court that would enforce the ""contract"" the parents seem to think they have."

Block his number and if anyone gives you a hint of shit about it explain that you went on a date, he asked for sex the whole time, when he walked you home he tried to come up and was aggressive and later insulting about it. Anyone halfway decent will see him as a creep. "
This is abuse. Please leave. You deserve better. There may be domestic violence organizations in your area that can help. 
"I have to ask, if a condition of your relationship is that he needs to maintain his friendship with this girl, and you're not okay with him doing that, why did you agree to get into an exclusive relationship? For the record, I think it's completely fair to not want him to visit someone he hooked up with behind your back last time he visited them. But presumably, you already knew that he was going to want to visit her like he has done in the past, because he's said that it's important to him to stay friends with her?

You're not insane, it's reasonable to request that he doesn't visit her alone. But if that's what he's going to do, and you're not okay with it, maybe this isn't the right relationship for either of you."
"This. 

If expensive jewelery is stolen, this is the only way to go. "
"All of that is actually, unfortunately, common and fairly mild.

I've been roofied twice.  Once by a stranger, once by a ""friend"".  I started getting catcalled and followed home by grown men before I even hit puberty.  I've more than once had to duck into a shop to try and lose somebody.  I've been cornered and harassed on public transit.  I've had to cut out ""friends"" who would not respect my physical boundaries despite repeated attempts asking them to.  I've had men slow their cars down and just start driving really slowly next to me for a few blocks.  I actually prefer when they slow down and ask, ""How much?"" because in that case, usually just ignoring them makes them go away, but the silent stalking is infinitely creepier.  I've been drunk and had a boyfriend not stop when I told him to stop.

Her experience is incredibly, heartbreakingly normal. "
"This is what OP needs to do.  I'm the other person in my relationship, meaning I know I take awhile to do some things, especially eat.  My fiance used to get irritated by it, but I honestly can't eat faster without feeling sick.  The issue always was that he would tell me we needed to be somewhere ""in 15 minutes"" (or something of that nature), and by the time he said something about it there was no solution.  Now, I have asked him to give me a solid time he needs me to do something so that I can plan myself accordingly.  He now comments on how, using this method, I'm always ready to go, I just needed to be given the opportunity.

OP - could the both of you plan a bit more?  It sounds like, since the issue is with them eating, you both could plan your meals a little earlier in order to make your other plans on time since you're aware of the issue, or could choose restaurants that are quicker (like fast casual).  It seems there are solutions here that you could both compromise on if you planned ahead."
The brain is surprisingly simple at times. Things like this work.
Your devotion to your daughter is admirable.  But I am afraid that you are dreaming if you believe that your son is going to take on the burden (and  yes it is a burden) of taking care of your daughter after you pass away.  You need to face the fact that eventually your daughter is going to go into institutional care.  There is no way around this unless you outlive her.

"Yeah, you are correct. He didn't fall into some terrible tragedy. This is his fault, he did this to himself."
"I would change all my passwords and check that he hasn’t messed with any of your other technology. Then I would just wait him out. It’s obvious he’s messing with your phone and soon it will drive him crazy that he can’t snoop.  Eventually he will accuse you of something. 

Or you can just save yourself so time and dump him now. Zippers don’t unzip themselves. Bluetooth doesn’t turn itself on. Aps you’ve put in folders don’t access themselves. Stop making excuses for this guy. "

"Um, it's her family's home.  She's allowed to make the plans since she's hosting.  I would, however, give the others a heads up as to what you were imagining for the trip, OP."
I can’t imagine ever having sex again with a guy who would send such a cringe-worthy message to a stranger.  He has no self-respect.  Gross. 
"Definitely take time to process it. But honestly it doesn't sound great. If you frame it as a conversation on boundaries, rather than accusing him of doing something wrong, that might go over better."
"My best friend is like this. She got really bad at one point where she was just calling and texting me multiple times a day, she would blow up my phone at night and is the reason for me putting do not disturb on the phone now whenever I go to bed. What worked for me was just pulling back and not making myself as available to her.

When she would blow up my phone I would “screen” the texts and make sure she wasn’t having a serious issue (i.e suicidal) and then decide whether or not I wanted to help her with that particular issue. I decided to start pulling away from her after she ruined my honeymoon by calling me sobbing that her boyfriend broke up with her; she knew I was on my honeymoon and couldn’t really talk but she still blew up my phone. I think I received 30 plus texts from her before she called me. That was when I reached my limit with her to be honest. 

Pulling away from her helped tremendously! After a couple weeks of not being as available to her she called me and asked how I was doing and she knew she had been a handful; she wanted to just talk with me about my problems and made the entire thing about me. Frankly I was shocked that approach had worked! She’s still kind of like that to this day but all it takes now for her to realize she’s going overboard with the drama is for me to just pull back a little.

You deserve to have time to yourself in a relationship, especially in one like this because if you don’t, it’ll just continue to eat at you. I would try to start pulling back from her just a little, you aren’t her therapist and it’s not fair if she’s treating you like you are.

Holy moly this got super long, feel free to pm me if you would like some advice on how to handle a friend like her! 

TLDR: maybe it’s time to start pulling away from her a little just so you can have some of your space back and spend some time on you.

"Kids you ""can't"" met, that age gap, being shady with plans and timing - I really think you might be the other woman here. Do you know what kind of relationship he has with the kids' mom? Is he affectionate with you in public? Does anything else about this feel off?"
"I’m Colombian American, and most of my family has been here for the majority of their lives. Everything you said is spot on. My family gets in borderline shouting matches in a fun atmosphere and are super friendly. It’s part of the culture.

I can’t say that it’s something you get used to though to be quite honest. My uncle’s wife is white and they started drifting away from the family over time. Not saying it was her but I can tell she felt uncomfortable with everyone being loud, speaking Spanish around her and kind of being obnoxious at times.

Also keep in mind that these people can be fiercely loyal and if they like you will stand by your side (if you guys stay together of course).  "

"Wanting to suddenly cut out the wedding party because he thinks the tradition is stupid vs. feeling like he doesn’t have people he’s close enough with to be groomsmen are two very different things...and if this post is any indication I don’t think you have handled this well. This is the man you want to marry, and it seems like having your sisters be bridesmaids is more important to you than your fiancés feelings if he’s just saying the tradition is stupid because he doesn’t have anyone to ask.

&gt;My heart hurts for how lonely he apparently feels, but I also feel that he’s being dramatic and he brought this on himself

This just lacks all empathy. ‘Sorry you don’t like it, you’re problem, not mine!’. This wedding belongs to both of you.

Instead, I would apologise for your initial reaction to your fiancé, and work to problem solve the situation or find a compromise. To get to the core of what the problem is. Is it 4 people he thinks is too many for him to find? Maybe he could find two? Do you guys have any male mutual friends? Do you have a brother? Could you find a different photographer for the wedding portion or the whole event in general? Is there any mending the relationship with his brother? 

This wedding day is for both of you, do you really want your future husband to feel uncomfortable on your wedding day? Do you want to have him end up having to deal with the embarrassment of hiring groomsmen, or putting new friendships in a weird place if they think it’s weird they are being asked to be groomsmen? "
"Yep, fully-grown man finds an immature (literally, physically, developmentally, through no *fault* of her own) teenage girl to groom and to abuse the inherent power imbalance. Now that she's hitting the mid-twenties neurological development completion hump, she's beginning to see him for who he is. It's like she's beginning to clean the lenses he put on her.

Not only that, but he also plucked someone who was already abused, which made it easy for him to forge the next link in the chain.

OP, you are being abused. No woman this man's age (and I'm just about his age, with a narc-parent, no less) would put up with his shit for an instant. You need to put together a plan to safely get out, and don't tell him you're leaving until you have your ducks in a row."
"As someone who was once a teenage girl who had plenty of 30-year-old guys “befriend” me and call me jailbait, but also add that I was “mature for my age”...

It’s because he’s a creep. They all are, even the ones who claim to be “just being friends” or “just looking out” practically never have good or healthy intentions. "
"&gt; These types of manipulative men rarely change as they don't see their behavior as a problem

"I totally hear you on that!!  Also, Idk...... I just couldn't bring myself to spend so much on a *watch*??  I mean it only tells the time - even Apple watches that do a shit load of other stuff aren't that expensive.  Thats like the cost of a car?!  Maybe its just cos watches aren't my thing...."
"I had the weirdest experience with this. My friend has a computer repairs business. I took my PC to him and he fixed it. this then happened...

Me: How much do I owe you for the repairs?

Him: Oh you work in digital marketing right?

Me: Um, kinda, I'm more a digital producer/project manager

Him: Right cool how about instead of me charging you you do some marketing work for my IT business

Me: Um

Him: I'll email you!

I was so taken aback at the time that I didn't know how to respond. I later emailed him and told him I would really prefer to pay for his service, I'm not a marketer in the sense he wanted, and I don't have any experience marketing small businesses. Honestly it was so frustrating, the expectation that I could create an entire marketing plan and strategy in my spare time. I just wanted to pay him!"
"&gt;I went through his conversation with his male best friend and found that he was sending him some of my nudes, even after I told him not to and he promised he wouldn’t.

OP, you're not taking this part seriously enough. In one of your replies to a comment on here you say ""I'll be bringing it up to him soon"". Why are you being so chill about this super fucked up thing your bf has done to you?!

You're dating a terrible person. Sharing your nudes is reprehensible and beyond unforgivable. It's also illegal in some states where it falls under the category of revenge porn. 

In another reply on here you mention that your ""plan"" is to ask him to swap phones with you so you ""can go through each other's things"".

Please have some self-respect and confront him like an adult. This is a serious offense and if you are letting men (boys) get away with this kind of shit as young as you are then you are setting a very low relationship standard for yourself. You need to figure out what your boundaries are. Don't let someone humiliate you and degrade you this way. "
"The problem is that you think you are better than him and you deserve better than him, just because you put a lot more effort."
"Totally agree. Reading it I think it’s more about her own resentment to herself and her shortcomings rather than her husbands success. 

Also life and careers include so many intangible, soft skills like confidence and communication which he clearly must have, which also suit management very well. Although you were studying and working hard, he may well have refined his social skills much more than you have which are incredibly valuable attributes.

OP - you and your husband are a team! Be happy for him! "
"I’m a mad planner. I’ve worked and scrimped and pushed myself into the GROUND to get to where I am in my academic career and if anything is a thankless task it’s academia lmao. 

It got me a mental breakdown is what it got me. I still have the position I want but my grandad intervened after a while and said I need to be working smart sometimes, not just hard. And he was right. I brushed up on my people skills, started speaking up for myself more and going on intuition and it really helped me advance and network while maintaining my academic skills. 

When you work hard for something, you run the risk of basing your self worth entirely around it. I had everything that I am judged on how smart I was and how good I was at research. And yes, I’m great at it. I do a good job. But it doesn’t make me a better person than someone else. 

I struggled for a long time because I was *smart* damnit why couldn’t everyone just *accept* that and give me what I *deserved*. The harsh truth is we deserve nothing in this life. 

I would talk to your husband and possibly a therapist. And maybe stop downplaying how crushingly hard army life can be."
It sucks to be ghosted but trying to get closure instead of accepting you've been ghosted makes it worse.
She sounds like an abusive and manipulative ass. Leave her. She can marry someone else for her green card. 
"Well, obviously, you’re going to have to ramp it up if you want to keep attracting the rare attractive western woman. Make sure to make a ton of money (and keep it — no medical bankruptcy or stock market crashes for you!) and keep your responsibilities limited, so you can continue to maintain your own impressive physique. Don’t have kids, and if you do, don’t have any with special needs that require round the clock care. Find a job that enables you to support ever more intense exercise. Obviously don’t get sick — something like rheumatoid arthritis can seriously limit your ability to stay hot. Make sure you’re able to afford the occasional nip and tuck as you age, since you’re not going to want to be stuck with a middle aged woman. In other words, stay rich, lucky and unencumbered, and hopefully you can stay hot enough to attract someone in a similar position.

Good luck with that. Sorry you have to look at the rest of us, with our various burdens and limited gym time."
"&gt; Sex and intimacy after a baby is weird.

"\&gt; ultimately they would defer to what my fiancee wanted because it was her big day.

What? It's \*your\* big day too, your fiancee isn't marrying herself.

It's not unusual to be poor while in college, our generation got screwed over. Your parents and your fiancee's parents don't realize how hard they made the economy for us, and that not everyone can easily finish college in 4 years. I think as long as you're keeping busy with work and your education, you're on the right path."
"I wish I had advice, OP. My step brother is schizophrenic (+everything that comes with it) also. The fear that came with him living in their house was paralyzing.  He was baker acted a few handful of times, but like your sister, refused to take medicine due to paranoia. He thinks everyone is trying to kill him. It is heart breaking.

My dad + step mom are very low-income. They managed to scrape up enough money to rent him a house a few miles away from theirs. They would bring over week's worth of food on the weekend and visit every so often. It was no solution, but it helped us all to breathe a little easier knowing he was not in the house all the time. That bit of freedom seemed to help him a little tiny bit too. Now, his bio dad who disowned him a while back is paying for everything because he had to go to court for his most recent breakdown. I do believe it landed him in permanent support, but it is an obviously touchy subject so I don't ask for details since I know they are safe now.

While all of this was going on (10 years?), my dad and step mom went to NAMI support group meetings and honestly, that helped them a TON. Gaining a support system of people going through what they were was truly empowering, and gave them the strength and knowledge to keep fighting for him (our mental health care system is a complete let down) and to stay together as well.

Again, I wish I had advice. I just want you to know you are doing a great job handling it all. It's not easy."
"I don't know man. I've lived abroad for five years, and what you listed in your pros and cons is exactly how I feel. The family, the familiar and the comfortable over the uncomfortable, exciting and novel. I can tell you I have chosen the uncomfortable time and time again. I don't think there is much left for me back home. I am such a different person. I still got a long with my friends last time I went back, but it just wasn't quite the same. But then again, culture differences and language differences make for such a frustrating life sometime that I'm not sure I can do it anymore. The only advice I can really give is to not go home until you are really ready. I have friends who are sure, who are just waiting until their contracts are up, but I'm not sure. And it's way easier to keep going and have the option of going home, than to go home and muster the strength to leave again if it's not right. "
"You should report this straight away. 

It is very disturbing."
"Youre not overreacting, thats the general opinion here. 

But heres the thing, it doesn't matter. Because HE thinks you are, and he'll continue to treat you and the situation as such, so if you're gonna settle on not acting, then yes, you're overreacting and you should drop it, she's his friend and you cant tell him what to do. We can't change that for you, we cant make him not be insensitive."
"You don’t value peace, you are just afraid to tell your parents no. I guarantee your partner isn’t feeling peace. Your family is toxic and you let them treat you and your partner like shit. That does not sound like any kind of peace at all."
"Well, I think the actual exact number is more like 9.999999999986848/10 but I felt like that level of detail wasn’t really relevant to OP’s question,
y’know? "
"I dunno, he doesn’t sound content to me. Content people don’t remind each other not to get too uppity with the self esteem, like he did to OP. He sounds resigned to not liking himself.

There’s this unhealthy thing where, if you think poorly enough of yourself, you may think less of someone if they like you. Or fall in love with you. BF sounds like this, to me. Or he wouldn’t have squashed the crazy notion that one of them might have a jealous rival.

The thing that bothers me is, people like this don’t rise up to find joy and pursue dreams; they actively pull you down when they see your eyes sparkle a bit. Sparkling disrupts the complacency of ‘why bother, that’s not for people like us.’ 

This is a lot to read into a comment, but based on how OP describes him, BF seems complacent in a morass of low expectations and not rising above whatever he sees as his station. It’s a stifling tar pit of a mindset. Hopefully I’m totally offbase, but if I’m right and it’s the crab bucket mindset like I think, better OP can see if she’s hitched her wagon to a lead weight instead of a star, or even just a loving companion who’s a good wagon-pulling partner and points out pretty scenery."
"&gt;You could also think of it as earning a favor.

"Its pretty judgemental to say its selfishness. My wife and I met in Germany, live in Germany, and have lived in Germany for a combined 25 years. I'll invite extended family on the off chance they want to visit europe and have a place to stay, but I wont be paying for them to come here! "
What are you at a loss about?  She's told you she's only married to you because of the lifestyle.  You should believe her.
"I enjoy smoking as well, but sounds like your hobby is smoking weed. My two cents, but if your relationship truly evolves around smoking weed it's not much of a relationship. Try not smoking at all and see if the relationship endures. If not then I think your SO values weed more then what you guys have."
"Honestly, it sounds like she got you drunk to try to take advantage of you which is super sketchy.

I would honestly tell your friend the truth.  I’m guessing this will come out at some point and it would be better coming from you.  I would just be super honest with him and see how he reacts."
She won't even consider daycare.  And I'm betting there's some serious PPA/control issues at play there too.
"He called the other parent the “son’s dad” which in the context it was used implies there is only one dad. Since there are two parents it’s further implied that OP’s partner is the kid’s mother.

Edit: It’s not perfect, that’s why I said it was “kind-of implied” rather than it was directly stated.

Edit 2: As for the gender neutral terms, I think it’s because they aren’t married. He can’t say “wife” but “girlfriend” seems too casual for a 15 year relationship that is similar to a marriage. Thus “partner”."

"My landlord is great, he's excellent at coming and fixing stuff.

But that doesn't mean that you should be completely clueless about how to fix things in your own apartment. We've had our oven break, a doorknob wobble, that sort of thing, and it's infinitely easier to spend ten minutes fixing it yourself than to wait days for someone else to do so.

Plus, I kind of consider it house-owning 101. I can practice fixing things here when I have a backup, so when I own my own house I know how to do more things."

"this is by far the best reply as a 17M that just was heartbroken by his 17F of two and a half years, in remarkably similar circumstances I might add. People here suggest cheating but I doubt it.

"Try letting someone make such a huge life changing decision for you. Something like that creates huge social and personal obligations to stay and be a parent when you didn't want to be at the time. Not only that but it is all consuming to be a parent. You have something precious to think about care for and protect, it takes loads of money and constant thought. Imagine being obligated to be in the situation you never wanted in the first place for the rest of your life, it's hard to be anything but bitter about it. It is the reason I firmly believe both parents should be consenting of having a child, having only one person agree to it often creates a toxic environment for the children. One shouldn't stay with someone who doesn't want the same life goals as them. It is going to make one of you unhappy in the end, I agree you should just go if you want to be a mom."

If she goes to the gym more than once a day, two groups of people might recognize her based on the times of day."
"Did you sign any legal agreement when you turned 18?  If not... you owe her nothing.  If she was serious- as soon as you turned 18- she should have sat you down and explained how it all worked, what would be charged and how it would be repaid. At that point, since you were an adult- you could have made informed decisions, including college debt. 
I would explain you will not be paying her back and her comments about your “tab” are offensive. You never took her seriously nor were you privy to what exactly her scheme involved.  Your relationship might take a hit for a while.  So be ready for that. (Could any of this have to do with you currently living with your dad?).  

You just need to stay strong and make it very clear repayment is not an option and it doesn’t matter if that is how she was raised.  Honestly... it is weird if she is serious. How do you even know what is on your “tab”.  

Probably goes without saying that you cannot ask her for money or to use her credit card ever again. 

Good luck. "

"This is a strange problem, and I'm definitely sympathetic. 

I have had a new friend become intensely dependant on me in a short time. It's... overwhelming, especially if you're an introvert. I eventually withdrew from this friend. I just couldn't handle that level of contact and intimacy from someone I hardly knew. Like you, I think she was just starved for friendship and so became overly emotional. 

I think you could try treating it like an inappropriate crush. That is, you hide it and ride it out. Act friendly, because you're friends, but tone down urges to vent personal problems. Try not to contact him constantly, or insert yourself in his life too often. Try to keep invitations to a fifty fifty ratio. That is, you interact at the same rate you observe him interacting with you.

Over time I think the intensity will fade to something more comfortable and realistic.

If possible, I would try reaching out more to other people as well. I know it's hard for you, but you just discovered that you're not a natural hermit. You NEED friends. The more friends you have, the less pressure you'll have on this one friendship.

Good luck! "
I think it’s important to figure out where this pressure is coming from to always have your hair and makeup done. Does he make comments ? Was there a past relationship that made you feel this way? Did your mom dress up for your dad every day?

Why not sit down instead of standing?
"After 2 years and you're not ready to at least try living together?? Dude, sounds like you're just not that into her. Look at it from her perspective, you've been dating 2 YEARS, and you get a new job offer, while that's great for you -- what about her? You guys have built a life together, for 2 years, and you get this new job offer -- did you consult her about the possibility of you moving for work? Or was this a decision she had no say so in? Because frankly, if you see a future with this girl, this should've been a team decision, not a ""you"" decision. 

That's just the first blow though! The second blow comes when she wants to come with you! She was willing to give up her job, her life, her dreams, her friends, and her family to come with you! But you hit her with the ""yeah babe IDK, we may end up together or we may not...I can't tell the future"". Wow. How would that make you feel? 

So basically you're telling her you would rather be 12000 miles apart, and do the LDR thing -- as opposed to living together, sharing a bed, and a breakfast table. Worst case scenario: what, you moved in together and you hate it, and you break-up! But at least you cared enough to try, right?? So really, you would be ok with seeing her maybe once every few weeks? Traveling hours on a plane? living out of a suitcase? You pick that over having her move in with you? Are you afraid to move in together?

 Because in all reality, you ended-up choosing your desire to have your own place, and this new job, over your relationship. That decision speaks volumes as to how much this girl really matters to you. "
My god you sound like a child...
"""I have to work a lot"" is very different than ""I can never travel"" which is how you presented it at first.  Even if you are the person with the more demanding job, she shouldn't be doing 80%+ of the travel.  60% maybe, but not 80%.

&gt;I don’t see how not being ready to move in with her = no commitment

You're both adults, you've been together two years.  It doesn't make any sense to spend three years long distance when she's willing to move.

Either you don't really want to be with her or you are one of those people who thinks they get to have everything their own way."
"Why do you keep going back.

Get a new job now. Don't go in the morning.

It's assault if the witnesses also agree, for all intents and purposes. You can file a police report but if you want it to move, have clear witnesses."
"So. I had my daughter at 18. Not as young as your mom, but young enough. My daughter's father was not as bad as a drug addict, but he was a chainsmoker who used my hard-earned money to pay for billiard girls EVERY night, leaving me alone to take care of a newborn baby while still in stitches. He also was mentally abusive, always telling me I wasn't a good girl, I was so ugly and unlovable and only him would pity me so much to want to impregnate me, isolated me from my family and friends, and beat me once (fortunately that hit was what woke me up).

I left when my daughter was two. She was old enough to remember ever having a father, but she actually couldn't remember at all because her father was almost nonexistent.

&gt;Around the same time though I asked her what my fathers name was &amp; you would had thought i slapped her across the face.

When my daughter asked me about her father, it was like she was physically slapping me. All the horrible memories and painful things I have endured at his hands surfaced, barging through my mind, unstoppable. I actually cried because it just brought back all of my past trauma (and looking for therapist in my country is pretty hard, people here think mental illness is a stigma, and many people got chained instead of being brought to mental hospital, so I never get one).

After I left, he started looking for me. Telling me he would change, he would always love me, that he was wrong, and he would do anything to keep our family together. Promising that he would work and earn money to support us, and he would drop the two girls he fucked night after night using MY money.

Perhaps 13-year-old me would believe what he said (I started dating him at that age). But after 7 years, 20-year-old me could just heard all the insincerity and saw that he feared he would not be able to live in leisure again like when we still lived together. So I cut all contact with him.

When my daughter was 10, I told her about her father. Fortunately she understood it pretty quickly. I told her that meeting him when she was still in a tender age would never result in good, and it was much too painful for me, so if she would like to meet him, she would have waited until she turns 18 so she could meet him herself. Not that we would know where to find him, though, since it has been 9 years and not a word about him reached our ears.

So what does me telling my own story do to you?

I'm telling you this could very well be the case with your mother and biological father, nay, might be even worse if he was truly a drug and alcohol addict who dated a minor (mom was 15/14 when they had sex, the dad must at least be 21 if he could buy alcohol, or at the very least 18, he might even have been raping her just like how my ex raped me)

&gt;He could be looking for me. I could try even tracking him down so we could meet. I could ask him all the things ive ever wondered about him.

The fact that it has been 14 years and not a shadow of him ever appear makes me think very likely that he never tried, at all. He might just be like my ex who doesn't care about his own daughter, his own flesh and blood, whether she is alive or dead, so long as I brought money home for him to spend at the billiard bars.

&gt;Maybe even get him to pay for some stuff, i dont know that my mom has ever gotten any money but it really could have helped us over the years i think.

Ah, the naivety of a child. I remembered when I was your age I too, believed everything my ex told me.

Your biological father very likely doesn't care about you. Your mother left when she was 8 months pregnant so there's little chance he didn't know you exist. It's probably nearer that he doesn't care whether your mother give birth or not and whether you exist or not. He just doesn't give a damn about you two. He won't ever give you money. I bet he won't be very pleased when you track him down and go meet with doe-filled eyes and a bunch of fatherly receptions you imagined in your head.

&gt;Maybe my mom made him stay away, i have no idea!

I'm pretty sure if your mother knows where he is, she damn well makes him stay away to PROTECT you, just like what I would do if I ever know where my ex is.

&gt;Hes had over a decade to grow up &amp; mature now. Its pretty selfish to think he hasnt changed at all in that time. Plus I'm 14 now and deserve to know!

Again, the naivety of a child. It's pretty selfish of you to disregard your mother's feelings and trauma (judging from her violent reaction) to please your own selfish imagination. I said imagination, because sounds like you are imagining a lot of things your biological father could be and think them as the truth. The fact that you are still so naive at this age makes me thinks your mother is perfectly right in not telling you about the ex.

&gt;TL;DR My mom is being pretty mean by not telling me my father name, even though ive asked a few times. How can I make her tell me?

You're being pretty mean by forcing your mother to remember again all the trauma and painful things she have endured in the past to have you just because you ""find it annoying"". You need to learn some freaking empathy before opening that little mouth. She may very well have endured a whole world of horror unimaginable for 14-year-old you when she was staying with the ex. Stop asking, shut your mouth, and wait until your sorry little ass grows up to an adult woman of 18 and if you still want to find him, go find him by yourself and don't bring your poor mother into this messy whirlwind you created for yourself.

TLDR: I'm sorry for being harsh but I'm very angry right now imagining if my daughter were you."
"As I was reading this I assumed that what you found was something kinky and weird and my response would have been to have a conversation and find a way to compromise. As I read on my stomach dropped and the post became mortifying. I would consider myself an extremely open-minded person that would probably somehow find a way justify grown men's attractions to animated sexualised early teens but that is not what this post is about. These are real life children this man, or person ( I'm having trouble qualifying him as such) is sexualising . There is no excuse, there is no understanding and empathy. There is just anger and rage that these people exist and I have to think that there is another one out there giving himself more and more allowances. Report him to the police."

"&gt;He is already insisting on exclusivity, and says if I value him, I need to go exclusive with him now.

Yeah, that’s a red flag. Particularly the wording: it sounds like a variant of “if you loved me, you’d...” You’ve *just met* and you made it clear from the beginning that you weren’t looking for a relationship. 

I’d tell him that since you two are obviously looking for different things, it would be best not to hang out further. 

Edit: Grammar"
"“I guess my mistake was assuming that my husband wanted the best for our family too” 

This made me feel sick. It’s toxic and disgusting! 

She needs to go get a job herself! Depression is probably crippling her because she is at home 24/7, which she has admitted she hates. 

This screams of laziness to me. Which feeds the depression which keeps the cycle going. 

Three jobs!! This man was a hero for not breaking sooner. "
"The out of pocket would be when I moved back into their house whilst I was an out patient for about a year afterwards. I wasn’t able to work but I did get a hefty insurance payout so never needed them to pay for anything. Rehab and bills were all covered for medical and treatment wise.

 I did borrow 2grand initially when I wanted to change learn my new career and then repaid them as the first bit of money I received. I think if anything it would be money when I was a teenager, maybe got $30 for the movies or something. "
"I have a huge Filipino family. For my parents' 50th they expected my siblings and I to throw them a party like this and invite everyone we've ever met and everyone our relatives have ever met. It was very expensive just for booze and rentals and stuff (we only did passed appetizers because we knew we'd never be able to stop people from bringing food, so we set up a potluck style table and had more food than we'd ever know what to do with), because we were also expected to fly people in to the US from the Philippines (and in a few cases, China).

I have 5 siblings who were able to help (and a few more but they were in high school) and it was so so much money. On top of that, my parents kind of hate each other and are only married out of stubbornness, and none of us were allowed to mention the 10 years my father abandoned our family in the middle there. The event isn't a common event in our culture, but the expecting children to move heaven and earth for mommy and daddy is, the showing off your wealth to your friends and extended family is, etc. It was a gigantic pain in the ass and big financial burden but none of us even thought of saying no because it would've been considered so 'disrespectful' and 'ungrateful.'

For reference, too, the kids who paid were all in their late 20s into their 40s and even my brother who was 43 was like, 'Yes mommy and daddy.'"
"My MIL did this too, she just wants to show off her rich kids. "
"Definitely talk to her, but it is not her job to unpack all of your issues with sex. "
"That's really not your problem at this point. You seem like a really nice and giving person, but inviting someone who you already know can barely afford rent is a terrible idea. 

How long is this trip? That's time she is taking away from work to earn money to pay for things! Don't foot her bill. But if she comes, it's going to happen most likely. Be prepared to be miserable. I highly doubt the others will back out since Sue wasn't part of the original group."
"If he cares about Karen as a student, he needs to shut this shit down.

People talk. It doesn't reflect well upon Karen if people are talking- every success she has, people will speculate whether she truly earned it. It might not be right but that's the reality of the situation.

Granted, he should be worried about saving his own hide but it's not like this benefits Karen in the long run."
"And shut it down *in writing.* If the only paper trail is her consistently inviting him out to dinner and witnesses saying they observed inappropriate behavior between the two of them, it's not going to look good for him. He needs to respond firmly and in writing to anything she puts in writing that could potentially tarnish his reputation. "
Oh my goodness. I'm cracking up in the middle of a coffee shop right now.

"This is SEVERE depression, and that is totally understandable given the incredible loss you both suffered. But this is not fair to either of you. You both deserve to have your lives back, and this cannot happen if you are having to take care of her like a parent, and her only real life is lived online. 

She needs to find another psychiatrist. Ask about all the different options. There are very mild medications with few side effects for most people (like wellbutrin) that perhaps she could start with. Find a psychiatrist who will talk through all of the options and their potential side effects with her. 

Then you can pair that with grief counseling, and you can try around until you find one that fits her. 

Your wife needs help. And I wonder how long you can go on like this without ending up worse off yourself. It is impossible to take care of yourself properly when you are taking on all of the work of caring for someone else. It's amazing that you care for your wife so deeply, but over time we can only stay well enough to take care of others if we make sure to take care of ourselves."

"This is one of the most intense posts of denial and projection I have ever seen. If he does not go to therapy his relationship will be over soon or his gf will be put in intense amounts of pain by trying to make him feel better. Which of course she cannot, because this is not about her.  


OP if you read this: Go to therapy or have the decency to break up. She does not deserve this."
"This is only my opinion. The (42f) is YOUR friend so your husband should appreciate that and respect that boundary. Confiding in her, behind your back, by discussing your sex life is horribly wrong and should’ve been talked about with him. Don’t let your guard down on this one. Stand your ground and nip this in the bud. He’s playing a dangerous line and crossing too many boundaries. I’m not saying your husband will cheat on you. He should know how his behavior is making you feel uncomfortable even if it makes him angry and defensive. At least he’ll know. Like I said, only my opinion. Would love to know what others think. Keep us posted if you can. Good luck!"
"As someone who was abused by my first boyfriend, I was 15 and him 17, she won't listen but still talk to her. Let her know that you are there for her. And be there! If/when you see something call it out right then and there. Because the thing is if he thinks she told on him he will punish her. So talk to him as well. Tell him what your girlfriend saw, emphasis on saw. 

My ex did that to me, grabbed my arm and threatened me. Then it escalated, he pushed me into oncoming traffic, he strangled ne would not allow me to sleep on the bed, called me all night every night and if I didn't answer on the first signal I was obviously cheating. He raped me. 

It will get worse. Protect her. I know you are not home a lot but still. I wish someone, anyone would have done something for me. That's what I can't get past, even with therapy: That no one did a thing. "
Your boyfriend is a bad fish. Throw him back. There’s too many people out there who won’t do you like this. You deserve better.
"If it doesn't bother you you won't do it. Fair enough. But if your SO has been obviously bothered by it previously would you wait until it bothers her to the point where it effects her day to day life?

"What about having your husband invite his friends to his own guys-time-in ?

My thought was that this way you're building up his confidence in asking his own friends to chill out with him. "
Her mission is to poison any relationship you have since you aren't interested in her or to get you to take her up on her weird way of asking you to fuck her on the side.
"Given her age, this might be the first time that she met up with someone she knows only online. And she just headed straight to your apartment to stay? Really it would have been best if she'd been in her own hotel and you met up for lunch or something. It sounds like she thought it would be a fun adventure, bit off more than she could chew, started realizing how crazy it was to spend a weekend in a stranger's apartment, panicked her way out of the situation, and was too embarrassed to salvage it after that."
"There is no conceivable reason that a man of 27 should follow girls of 13-14 on any social media platform if they aren’t relatives.  He has nothing in common with them.  Nothing.  They are too young to understand the power imbalance.  Teenage girls nowadays will simulate sexual acts and even get naked on Snapchat.  It draws attention and they really don’t understand the danger.

Many of the red flag behaviors you described sound like grooming, which is where a sexual predator gets his targets used to or familiar with his presence and attention, so much so that the girls may develop friendly or romantic feelings for him and won’t resist or tell when he makes more physical moves.  

I’m not one to recommend snooping, as it’s very invasive, but I’d suggest doing that and also calling the cops. Your dude is majorly twisted.  Have you ever met any of his exes?  That would be telling also.  "
Isn't it super illegal to date someone and not mention you are on the registry?

 That’s a pretty big red flag for a 28-year-old. She cries when you don’t buy her what she wants? That sounds like a child. Her choosing to stay in your country is her choice. It does not make you automatically indebted to her and mean you have to finance her lifestyle.

"This is so well put. For the first part of a child's life they have little to no identity outside of being an extension of their mother. OP, you were there for the beginning and all the time you've spent with her since means the world. 

I have a 2 month old who arrived via emergency c-section 5 weeks early. It was not the way I expected birth to go and from time to time I cry about not carrying her to term and I worry about long term health impacts. I feel immense guilt over the 2 weeks she had in the NICU. But the fact of the matter is, our little girls weren't concerned or even really fully conscious at the time. All they know is that we love them and we've been there for them. As they start to really experience the world, we're there with them.  And we went through some scary stuff to make it happen.

Please look in to therapy. You have two negative experiences that are getting rolled up together and will eat away at you. You need to get your thoughts clear before you go through pregnancy again."

"I mean, it's crappy to say to your partner that you'll always love someone else more than them. It would even be weird for her to say, ""I'll always love you less than I love my mom."" It's just unnecessary and hurtful! Why do it? You can absolutely say that this made you uncomfortable. 

As for the other stuff... eh. The nudes are potentially a red flag (not the birth ones - it's not like those are sexy pictures), and I think you should ask what that's about. Just being really close, texting all the time, and going to each other for support? That's just some friendships. 

For context, I'm a bi woman in a relationship with a man. One of my closest friends is a married bi woman. We can hang out for hours at a time, turn to each other for support, including with our relationships, and text each other things like ""I LOVE AND MISS YOU, YOU ARE AMAZING.""

"Because it's how an adult takes initiative for household responsibilities. You do or ask if you don't know what to do. (Ideally there'd be a plan so that everyone has a good sense of what to do, but at least asking the question demonstrates that you realize you should be contributing.) You don't wait to be asked for daily chores because you know the household can't function without them. 

I can see waiting to be asked for special/unusual chores, like scheduling an annual deep clean or painting a room, because those expectations aren't always easily known or obvious, but I can't see why it should be one partner's responsibility to ""step up and ask"" the other partner to do his or her share of the basic chores.

That lack of initiative is so demoralizing and unattractive, to be honest. "
"You're not being ridiculous. All you're asking for is one holiday with your family, and your bf and his mommy are whining and acting like you're being unfair.

What'll happen when you marry your bf and if you have kids? You'll want them to know all their grandparents. Is his family going to whine when you want to take them to Korea for a week instead of going to their lakehouse to see people they just saw last month?"

100%. If you had doubts before the kid was born, ask for the paternity test before you sign the birth certificate. If suspicions arose during the marriage, get a paternity test right away.

Dude deserves to be alone. "
"I can tell you, since my ex-wife sent me language checking jobs during work.

It's fine if you accept a quick &amp; dirty answer, a pointer. The most annoying part of what my ex-wife did, and I ultimately had to put a stop to, was demanding high-quality work from me (proofreading) when I was at work, and then if I ever missed something, she'd hold me accountable.

This didn't happen every day, but god was it annoying when she sent me a semi-complex task expecting a prompt and thorough answer."

"I'm not sure if this is an age thing, but as a woman, I'd say it's up to her if she puts up with it or not. Some comments say he shouldn't be touching your gf the same way they'd say, he shouldn't be touching your X box. The only way this has anything to do with you is if SHE asks you for advice how to make it stop. However, I'm in my 40's and would flip the fuck out if my bf had this possessive outlook. We would see it as immature, but maybe people your own age would have different opinions. "
"It is a toxic way to live, and could be why she's not doing as well in life. She thinks her way is the right and only way and when presented with evidence that she may be incorrect, she attributes that to dumb luck rather than reevaluating her assumptions.

"&gt; I do trust him not to cheat. I think it’s strongly option 2, which is why my no-fraternizing comment made him angry: so I know/trust him so little that I think that’s the only thing stopping him?

So, then, let me ask you this:  If you trust him so fully, then why did you keep pressing on the issue of this woman messaging him?  If you *truly* think you have nothing to worry about, then *why* did you make the remark about the no-fraternizing policy?

Was it an ill-chosen attempt to be funny, or was it a latent and subconscious fear-driven ""humorous but only if it's not actually warranted"" kind of thing?

I ask because it's an important distinction; if he has given you no reason at all to think he might be a cheater, but your demeanor communicates to him (even unintentionally) that you think he *might* be, then this might simply be the culmination of him stewing about the fact that you have been subtly hinting that his faithfulness is in question for longer than you realize.

This is something I struggle with, myself:  I hate it when someone calls me out on my BS, but nothing makes me angrier than being accused of something I am *not* guilty of."
"That’s not “non-romantic”, it’s smart.  I’m glad to hear you are thinking about this, but just remember that engagement and marriage is a decision made between both of you.  Be honest with her!  Tell her your timeline (&lt;1 year for engagement) and tell her you’ve been saving for the future.  While she may be initially disappointed that it won’t happen on the trip, I think she’ll be excited that you are thinking about engagement and there is a timeline for it to happen. "

"(she’s not reacting well to the situation but she’s not on this sub asking for advice)

I dated a guy who claimed that this online long distance friend had made up /exaggerated their relationship and she was “crazy” because she thought she was going to move to be with him. I don’t know when they fell out, but it was right around when he and I started dating. He claimed she lied about him and he had to leave that internet community. Flash forward two years and I am away for the summer (we’re in grad school) and he starts being critical of me and generally sketchy. Turns out he has a new gf that he’d known online for years and had recently spent the summer in our city and she’s now looking for jobs there. After I found out, he tried to paint ME as the stalker because I figured it out by following his online account on a forum he had told me about and because I sent her one brief email telling her about me. He also claimed we were never serious, despite having previously criticized me for not saying ily soon enough or being willing to move in. Idk exactly what happened with that girl but I know that internet community has since expelled him too. "
"Sure, man. I hear most women travel to the middle east to begin their careers. "
I can believe he said such a douchy thing to you &amp; not even in a fight just cause hes an asshole that wants an accessory not a wife
"Keeping your daughter humble and kind in the face of abject admiration will be your challenge as a parent. It was always going to be no matter what, you've just probably got one of those doll-faced kids. You're going to have to teach her to be gracious on hard mode. Oh well.

Let the world love her. Every kid deserves it."
And she’s not your MIL because you are not married. She’s not your future MIL because you are not engaged. She is the mother of the guy you are sleeping with. And you are doing it in her house. And you are willing to sleep with a 30yo man who lives with his parents. These are all tough to respect. 
"I'm 26/F, and if a guy told me he didn't have or want a phone, it would probably be a deal breaker for me too. Calling you anytime I wanted something (or... email, I guess?) would just be too much hassle, when there are plenty of guys I could get along with equally well that have phones. Be true to yourself and all, but recognize not a lot of people are going to be willing to date that self.





Seconding most other advice here. Put it on your profile, and weed out the people who have a problem with it that way."
"Don't beat yourself up too much, it's only human to want companionship, romantic or otherwise. Whatever happens though, don't be with someone out of loneliness. He with them because they're a good partner for you. 

I second what others have said about trying a new hobby or meetups for meeting new friends. "
It's ok for her to feel a little hurt. Harsh truths tend to do that. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be told. You did well and she'll get over it. I hope she really gets off your back this time.
"&gt;Also when you regularly repair things and forgive quickly, you get less afraid of fights, and freak out/lose your cool less (and less often) when something tense comes up. It just gets everyone into a better cycle where small things don’t become big.

This is a good point.  If you're not afraid of an issue becoming a fight because you know you can cool it off quickly, you don't tense up nearly as much around certain topics and are more likely to actually discuss them and end up not even fighting in the first place."
"Well, I did get a tattoo because I want to. Because it’s my body, and it’s my choice. Not to spite my mother. My mom asked, I answered, and we didn’t have any further discussion about it. That’s why I said it was the end of it. We didn’t fight, she wasn’t hurt, we are both doing okay and have a good relationship. We respect boundaries, and she knows I can do what I want with my body. She doesn’t like my tattoos, but she knows who I am as a person and a daughter and my tattoos doesn’t change the way we treat each other. 

If she has to weigh which is more important to her, her tattoos or her boyfriend, can’t she ask the same question? What’s more important to her boyfriend, his dislike of her tattoo (if she gets one) or her? 

Also you can’t judge me and say I’m ungrateful because you have no idea what my relationship is with my mom. What we’ve both done for each other go waaaayyyy beyond tattoos. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
You two sound toxic together.  You sent her a classy text after she refused to respond to you.  That should be it.  Don't call her.  Let it die.
"How hard is it to accept, “My company says that we can’t give out any information that hasn’t been released by the press” though? "
"&gt; But girlfriends are not rehabilitation centers for men with anger issues. If someone has a violence problem, they need to address that with a trained professional before dating AT ALL.

fucking PREACH IT. your girlfriend is not your therapist (even if she happens to be a therapist). go get some help like an adult!"
"Could you add her on Facebook?  I wouldn't find it weird if someone I see a lot wanted to keep in touch over the summer.  It would also confirm that she's single, if you haven't been able to confirm that yet."
"I wouldn't give her those options even. You're just giving her something to argue with. Just keep telling her you're not paying a penny for her to move and let her figure it out herself-by coming up with options for her, you're just engaging in her fantasy that this is your problem."
I think they mean she's a July 4th (American Independence Day) baby.

"Exactly. This is her business! She has trouble finding caregivers for her child, and if he is causing part of that trouble, she should know. Maybe she could/should fight for more custody of her child so that he won't be able to cause that trouble anymore."
"I think if you got tested when you broke up with your ex like you were supposed to, you wouldn't have this problem to begin with. I think you should start your conversation with Jeff with a sincere apology for neglecting your sexual health and compromising his in the process. It isnt your fault that your ex was an asshole, but it was pretty evident that you suspected he was sleeping around and you did nothing with that information, there was a lot you could have done to be more proactive and it was your responsibility to do so. 

I think seeing you take ownership for your part will help with the whole conversation. If he's as kind and understanding as you say, he won't take advantage of your self awareness/vulnerability and turn it against you

"
"Thoroughly agree. This is something I look out for-people who will do stuff for people if there's glory in it, or to make strangers think they're great, but not when nobody's around to see it or for the people who already support them. 

Personal anecdote; I live in a house with four bedrooms of various sizes. When the girl from the biggest bedroom moved out, I moved into her room with higher rent so that there'd be more room for my boyfriend and his stuff so he could start keeping clothes at mine and what have you. I was working late the day I had to move rooms and my boyfriend, who had the day off, only agreed to move my stuff when I offered to PAY him to do it. He moved everything but literally just dumped it-books everywhere, clothes all over the place, I couldn't see the floor, he did NO organisation. I came home to him building new (young, female, pretty) flatmate's furniture for her and her telling me what a sweet and thoughtful boyfriend I had to do such a nice thing. I'm still angry about it.

He later cheated and I remember how he wouldn't do the thing that would make my life easier when I was moving for his benefit and stressed, but he was super happy to help a stranger who told him what a great guy he was."
"&gt; The only viral STDs are HIV and herpes

Hepatitis B (A and C are not usually transferred sexually) and HPV (warts) are also common viral STIs.

Then there is cytomegalovirus and molluscum contagiosum which are also viruses and often passed sexually."
"I think your wife secretly it even subconsciously doesn't like it herself, and is passing it off like the neighbors feel more strongly than they actually do. I don't doubt that they've expressed to you that *they* don't like it, but I think, if your wife didn't care, she would push back harder against them. "
"So much yikes. Each of you need to sit and rethink your values. Speaking at her about your boundaries and reintegrating them is gross. Also you asked if you were being controlling the majority said yes and now you are trying to defend it and not understand it. She lied which she definitely should not have. But ffs you sound like a terrifying person to be around let alone married to. You’re married, partners, life committed, by you’re still allowed to have friends even if her friends don’t meet your criteria. "
"I mean, if you’re already beginning to wonder “what if?” now, it will be all you can think about at 30. "
"Thanks for your advice! Sounds like a good chat before the trip is in order. As ""non-romantic"" as it may be, the main reason I haven't proposed yet is money. I've just recently got to the point where I can save up enough for a ring, wedding, all that. I see it happening in the near future (&lt;1yr)"
"&gt;  making her give you a full apology and coaching her through it in such situations would be very weird, controlling and patronising.

I agree. There's a difference between a simple ""I'm sorry"" because you bumped into someone and a full on apology because you did something that deeply hurt someone."
This guy sounds like he has a textbook Avoidant attachment style. The adult attachment styles may be a helpful framework for decoding what's going on in his head.
their plan is to let the 15 year old make the plan.
"Stop worrying so much about hurting this guy's feelings and do what you need to do to put distance between you and him. Why are his feelings more important than yours here? Make it clear to Liz that you never want to spend time with Jay again and if she insists on him tagging along with her, then you may just have to decide to spend less time with Liz in general. His poor mental health and alcoholism isn't an excuse to be a shitty person who sexually harasses you."
Exactly. My engagement ring was $70 and I love it. He is just using it as an excuse. If it was important to him it would happen. You can always upgrade to something later on an anniversary.
He needs a better way to cope with his work stress and learn how to communicate with you. My SO managed to teacb me this - if you cant get him to treat you right simply ditch him. Give him a chance to learn if he cannot be taught go find someone that deserves you.
"Can't link in this subreddit, but google this text and you should find something:

**Perception: the courts are biased against fathers, who almost never get custody.**

Fact: Though it is true that women are far more likely to be awarded custody, they are also far more likely to *ask for it in the first place*. To establish bias, one must show (at the very minimum) that equally qualified fathers who request custody are denied more than half of the time, and here the data prove inconvenient. Courts can't be expected to award what they're not asked to. It turns out that fathers who ask for custody (and don't give up) are very likely to get either sole or joint custody:

From a state of Massachusetts study of custody awards at the state and national level come these studies of cases where fathers requested custody:

**Study 1:** MASS   
2100 cases where fathers sought custody (100&amp;#37;)  
5 year duration

**29\% of fathers got primary custody**  
**65\% of fathers got joint custody**  
7&amp;#37; of mothers got primary custody

**Study 2: MASS**  
700 cases. In 57, (8.14&amp;#37;) father sought custody  
6 years

**67\% of fathers got primary custody**  
23&amp;#37; of mothers got primary custody

**Study 3: MASS**  
500 cases. In 8&amp;#37; of these cases, father sought custody  
6 years

**41\% of fathers got sole custody**  
**38\% of fathers got joint custody**  
15&amp;#37; of mothers got sole custody

**Study 4: Los Angeles**  
**63\% of fathers who sought sole custody were successful**

**Study 5: US appellate custody cases**  
**51\% of fathers who sought custody were successful** (not clear from wording whether this includes just sole or sole/joint custody)

The study concluded:

&gt;The high success rate of fathers does not by itself establish gender bias against women. Additional evidence, however, indicates that women may be less able to afford the lawyers and experts needed in contested custody cases (see “Family Law Overview”) and that, in contested cases, different and stricter standards are applied to mothers."
"&gt;she learned growing up that relationships were dangerous, not safe. unpredictable and more likely to hurt you than help you. but some (most?) relationships can be helpful and enjoyable.

you just defined my problem!! thank you! I knew how to describe the reason why I am that way, but never knew how to put into words the problem that I have.

&gt;is there anyone in your life who you'd like to spend more time with? 

you probably won't be surprised, but I don't have much friends.  3 in total, that I consider friends, and all of them are in another country as I have relocated recently.

"If you can sleep at night having fulfilled the final act of your abusive father against your brother, you're a sociopath in my opinion.

"I think it's very concerning that she sees this as a potential for negotiation.  The child aside, pregnancy alone can have consequences, sometimes severe.  She has absolutely zero say over what you do with your body.  Imagine she asked you to get a nose job or liposuction, would this be something she should be able to ""negotiate"" with you on? "
It probably can't actually end up ok
"As a wife, when you said it was your inheritance, that would of been the start of a bad turn in the marriage.  You live in her house and work for her dad!   Does she call it her house or our house?  I don’t think she is a money grubber but a partner who should be included in the decision!

Your brother.... it is guilt driving you.  Honestly, the $$ given to you were your father’s wishes.   If you choose to give brother $$ and your wife is on board.... consider giving him $10K a year for however many years you want.    Don’t pay off his student loans.   He may need the $$ elsewhere.  It allows him control of the $$.  If he decides to squander the $$ away (like drugs) then you haven’t lost the $$  and may be able to help him later in life.   20’s are still pretty young to have access to such a high $$ amount and truthfully it won’t be til he is older for him to really mature!

I wish you luck... this decision would be easier for you if your wife was on board!  Work to that end with communication!"
"Where does he live in Brooklyn that it takes him an hour and a half to get to work? Can't he move closer to his job? I bet he could find much more affordable housing in Queens, the Bronx, or even New Jersey that would cut way down on his commute and rent."
Why didn't you tell her before she started the treatment? Now whatever you do you will be an asshole in her eyes.
"I think you need to sit her down, tell her exactly what you wrote here, and see if there is any adjusting of your life trajectories to be made. It sounds like neither of you is willing to sacrifice your 'plan' to be with the other person, and that's not a bad thing - it just means you can't be together.

She wants commitment. You don't. You haven't expressed anywhere in here that she's more than fun and comfort to you."
"She doesn't know my brother that well, but I think there are some cultural differences there. She doesn't dislike him, but they are massively different people. My wife is more professional and responsible and sort of suburban-esque whereas my brother is... well living in Brooklyn. I remember she was *astounded* that people could stand to live in the apartment my brother lived in, she is kind of sheltered from that kind of stuff. "
"If you weren't official, then he did nothing wrong, imho.

"Divorce is an option. Get a divorce. The answer is divorce.

Divorce. 


You feel like shit because your wife is lying to you and cheating on you. Of course your confidence is in the shitter. You need to get out of there and work on yourself. And who cares if your parents find out? They're not the ones who have to live with this asshole. 

Take control of your life, get a divorce, and get the hell out of there. Move on with your life. Have some self respect. 

And don't be an idiot, she is not going to give this other guy up, she knows you went through her shit, guess what, she doesn't care. "
"What a fucking snob he is. Cakes are hard work, and presumably she's doing that on top of looking after the kids/house so she's working long hours as well, double duty. But it doesn't come with high party and letters after your name, so he can't recognize any value in it."
Doesn't matter why she started it; she's not into you now.

That said, the line about knowing you'll be with him forever... I hope you can see that this is a hope and not a certainty? When we go into relationships thinking the world of a person we can fail to see when they treat us badly. If you want advice: try not to base life decisions on your early-relationship emotions. Ride this out for a year if it lasts that long, and then start considering things like cohabitation, etc. I spent way too much time losing myself in LTRs with people who held me back."

&gt;She's said before that I shouldn't expect us to have more sex in the future which really scares me.

She's not lying. In fact, she's probably implying that sex will be had even less in the future. And if you plan on kids, just forget about intercourse. Not happening. 

Unfortunately, this isn't something you can fix. She has medical issues and other reservations that precede your relationship. She is at peace with her libido. You are most definitely not. 

Your only decision now is whether to stay or not. Determine whether it's a deal-breaker or just an inconvenience for you. One thing is for sure, don't expect it to get better. She's told you herself that it's not. 

Good luck. "
"Your relationship sounds as if it’s been toxic for a very long time. Just because you are a man and she is a woman does not mean that physical abuse (or any abuse) is ok. Just because she has a cyst that may be cancerous does not mean it’s ok for her to hit you. Please, end this relationship and get out fast. This will happen again. Please, work on your temper so that way you can have a healthy and loving relationship with somebody else when the time is right. 

In short: End this toxic relationship. "

"Actually this sounds a lot like social anxiety.

I don't have social anxiety, mine is much more generalized, but with my anxiety also comes some pretty intense claustrophobia and agoraphobia. If I am panicking and don't actively have an anchor I tend to wig out and just leave.

This, however, is definitely not how to go about solving your issues. Your girlfriend needs to learn how to communicate, even when she thinks what she is going to say to you will make you sad or hurt your feelings. 

Social anxiety sucks, like hella bad... But she does have a duty to those around her that she cares about and part of that duty is effectively communicating her thoughts and feelings and not constantly going on the notion of ""easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission.""

Let her know you aren't upset she chose to leave, but let her know you *are* upset that she went dark and chose not to respond to you for hours. What if you had been hurt? Or kidnapped? She doesn't want a ""boy who cried wolf"" situation where she uses the ""I'll be right back!"" Excuse then disappears. 

One day you might just figure ""she just went home"" and you may not alert authorities until days later if something happens to her."
"These are reasons why she needs a baby sitter, not why you need to baby sit for her. Her reasons for needing a baby sitter is valid, but there is nothing about how you are her only option or why you owe her such a big favor you should sacrifise your birthday so she can go out partying.

To be clear, you are not her only option. She asked a lot of people before you and they all said no, which means you are not her only and defenitly not her first option for baby sitting. Also, they other people she asked saying no was respected by her. So it’s not that you are her only option or that saying no is not acceptable to her. It’s that she thinks that of all her options you are the one most likely to be guilted into taking back your no. Not the person who would have to give up the least, not the person who is her prefered choice of baby sitter, but simply the one easiest to push into doing it.

You shouldn’t feel guilty based on the reasons she gave you. It should make it clear that if she could accept a no from all the other people she asked before you, then she should just as easily accept a no from you. Telling her no is clearly acceptable in this situation by her own admission. So why should your no be treated as less acceptable. Especially by yourself. You said no because you don’t want to give up your b-day plans to do your friend a boring favor, and it’s just as valid to say no now as when you first said it. Don’t mistreat yourself by agreeing to do something you know will make you miserable to make someone else happy. Love yourself more than that.

Also, this is all because of her bad planning, and asking you to give up your very well planned out day to salvage her bad planning is extremly selfish. Personally, I would rather loose some money and apologies to the friend I’ll have to stand up rather than make someone else have a crappy b-day just to cover for me. I can’t think of a situation outside of an emergency where I would ever ask a friend to cancel her b-day celebration, but absolutly least of all because I messed up myself. That your friend is even asking this of you shows a concerning lack of disrespect for you, and you might want to think over if this friendship is a healthy and happy one."

"So, is this a larger trend of her putting you at fault for her choices? Like, do you think that she really thinks you're forcing her to cook and eat meat? It doesn't sound like it, and I ask because it sounds like she has a real pickle of a mom to navigate, and if this is just her way of keeping the peace with her family, and she really doesn't think you're forcing her to eat meat, then I think you have a much smaller problem than you think you have. Yes, you should talk to her that you're concerned her parents won't like you because of this. The reason she told her dad this is probably to make her look better, and if that comes at the expense of making you look bad, that's not fair. But, if she's dependent on her parents, and towing some line about eating meat is what she needs to do to not rock the boat, then I think you taking an arrow to the knee on this one is okay. Of course, it shouldn't become a pattern, and that's why you talking to her about this is important, and she's going to have to figure out some way to deal with this long term that isn't ""look at my controlling and animal murdering BF, he makes me do it""."

"I understand that it's hard, but you cannot go on just lashing out and not telling her what's going on. The only way you're going to resolve this is if you communicate with your wife. I wouldn't really recommend starting with open-ended questions, I think you just need to be direct and tell her what happened.

I told her the dates I was planning to take of work, the travel I intended to book, and asked her to let me know if my plans suited her.

He told her as soon as she opened it that it was for the both of them. He made it clear from the start she didn't get it twisted until speaking with hank.

She's been cultivating a separate, intimate relationship (platonic intimacy is still intimacy) with someone else and whether or not you realize it, you have instinctively withheld part of yourself because of that.

And the crazy thing is my co-worker’s wife is a very very good friend of my boyfriend’s mom and even his wife has told my boyfriend’s mom to fire him (coworker).
"What’s really funny is that when I said it, he didn’t know the word. I showed him the comic and he said he didn’t see anything wrong with what the sea lion was doing..."
"Very pegnant with #2 right now. I have one of my best friends who loved every second of being pregnant... We don't hang out while I'm pregnant because I will contemplate bludgeoning her with my flip-flops (the only shoes that fit my fat, swollen feet) of she tells me one more time how magical it is... "
"Do yourself a favor and just dump him, this dude sucks and I guarantee you it isn't worth it"
"As a non-American, I actually can't really fathom that as a 'starter'. It's probably different in houses vs. apartments, but for me &amp; my partner an apartment of about ~680 sq ft is more than enough space and my DINK friends usually live in even smaller ones (about 600 sq ft). "
"&gt; Her family telling at her should do a better job than girl to girl conversation.

This is almost never true.  Yelling is the last thing you want to do if you want someone to listen.

&gt;This girl,sounds entitled with lack of boundaries.

This girl sounds jealous and awkward.  A conversation about what's going on could go a long way towards making her stop, plus finding out why she's doing it and helping her with that.

"
That's true. However if she can break into a locked room she can break into a locked cabinet. That why I suggested hiding a box in a place only OP knew about. Not a bad  idea though! 
"We did. It was fun. But I guess my husband and I are kind of eccentric. It's just another self imposed challenge. Some people do no spend November, or dry January. We lived in a tiny house for 2 years and loved it. 

We finally moved out because we had a baby and I was scared of him falling down the loft. And he needed silence to sleep. Now we live in a spacious 800 sq ft two bedroom."

He isn’t quick-tempered. He’s an abuser. Your advice is appropriate for a healthy couple in a respectful relationship. That is not what this is. 
"I think it's perfectly reasonable for you to express discomfort at her spending one on one time with a hook up who is actively interested in her.

Edit: Especially since she's already lied to you about the nature of their relationship."
"Get her a bottle of cocoa butter lotion for the areas where her skin is stretching, if she doesn't already have one."
So can cosmetic surgery. But both are done for aesthetic reasons as well.
"I really like “anger vice”!

I love screaming at the Refs through the TV. I don’t think I have anger issues, but it’s fun and kind of cathartic to let loose like that. 

Environment and the people around you should always be taken into consideration though. If you can’t contain it depending on the setting, it might be a problem."
"Just out of curiosity, why do you dislike Jon Oliver? Not that you need to defend that position, I'm just curious. "
"This would.just keep the conversation going, imo. Mary Kay uses predatory sales tactics. I'd just say 'no thanks- not interested' .. something like that and stop responding to her messages about Mary Kay after that."
"A nice tiny home is also not that cheap. My friend just moved into a beautiful 300sqft one with all the latest appliances and ready-made for her, and it ran $60k. I don't think you'd get a cushy, nice, cozy tiny home without spending at least 10k on it. And then that is money taken away from your real house! "
It's embarrassing to many people even when they know the medical reality of it. I know I would be extremely peeved. It's okay to be embarrassed by something you don't want.
"You initiated a serious conversation with your BF over snapchat?? snapchat?? snapchat??

Geez...where do I even start...

But nevertheless, even though your method of communication was dumb and childish (if it's a serious conversation: call him! Learn to communicate like an adult, and you'll get treated like an adult) -- he should've responded, he should've called to check on you/talk with you. Clearly, you are NOT his #1 priority"
who said they have a husband?
"Former teenmom with ‘an extra special’ son here, my take on your situation:


- she is in the lead on if and how to fix this. Ask her what her plan is. Maybe she is ok with her adult son living with her and not moving out (ever)? Dont pressure her to be more strict bc you want her to. Without judgement hear her out. Afterwards you decide whether that is acceptable for you or not.


- consider this behaviour has been cultivated/allowed for 19yrs, you are not in the position and not capable to change him. 


- Labelling it pure laziness is a bit too easy for me. Definitely dont express this to him or her without them explicitly asking for your personal analysis of his character and this situation. 


- her son isn’t happy, focus on feeling empathy for him. That doesnt mean you go along with his victimhood, but use it in your own mind to prevent yourself from getting annoyed. See him as someone who is suffering but doesnt know to make it better. And maybe he will never be able to do so. 


- My guess is he needs mental care, and his condition had been neglected by you gf, causing it to get worse...


- With my boyfriend I have an agreement that I consistenly call my son out if he is rude or too blunt with my Bf. All he (Bf) has to do is be friendly to my son, he can and should(!) leave all the hard stuff to me and the professionals that I have sought out to help. 
It took some time to get to know each other, this went really slow but it paid out. They both have told me seperately that they like the other person now. And that they both like that the other one is more open, whereas they found it difficult in the beginning. Mind you, my kids did not hear about or meet my Bf until we were in a relationship for six months. We have been together for almost 2yrs now, but this summer we will have our first joint (one week) vacation. (We do not live together yet.) Bringing me to my last observation: 


- Sorry, but the two of you messed up by moving in together so quickly. You both could have used more time to get to know each other and each others lives. And you should have allowed this troubled young adult enough time as well."
"First: Drop him like  bad habit. The indicators suggest he knows his game, and is a bad person (trading up from your friend etc).

Second: I'm not a big fan of karma, but telling your friend you would stop seeing a guy (to be emotionally supportive) and then doing so behind their back, and possibly getting herpes? That just seems a bit poetic to me.

So tell your friend that you lied/betrayed their trust, but also tell them that you probably have herpes. Might make them forgive you a bit quicker. Or it might prompt her to go get checked, as homeboy is probably seeing her on the side too, why else would she have been so put off by you seeing him?"
"Oh, this is a great one! Just make sure that Delivery Company knows you are not a manager and are just making the observation as you see he comes in with a great attitude.  "
"Does he do that sort of thing when he's sober? You handled the situation as well as you could have; he was just being super annoying.

A lot of people are calling what he did abusive/controlling/etc. and if he acts that way when he's sober (even to a very lesser degree) I'd be careful. But my husband gets super obnoxious when he's drinking. He's pushy (not physically, I mean) and likes to have long conversations about things that I usually don't care about, often at 4 AM after he's convinced me to stay up that late (see: pushy) when I'm trying desperately to get to sleep. And when I try to go to bed, he accuses me of ignoring him/not caring about what he has to say/etc. He's not abusive or controlling in any way; he's just a very annoying drunk."
"Then there's the onslaught of complete strangers who thinks that baby bump = free pass to fondle you. I fucking hated that. My cousin's abs separated so far she needed an operation to get them back together. I couldn't sleep the last month cause not a single position felt comfortable, and I was hella constipated. The dump I took before birth was a small birth it itself (and only possible due to the miracle of modern medicine), but it was glorious.

I think it's fascinating how we are built to grow actual humans inside us, but it's clear that the machinery that is the human body could use a whole lot of tuning before pregnancy becomes magical."
"It would be polite to go and offer your sympathy. Say you are sorry for his loss and wish him well. 

You sound worried that that would he too much or make him feel awkward or creeped out. Here is where I think it would get creepy...

1. If you stayed a long time or tried to talk to him while he had other guests he is closer to 
2. Apologised or were overly emotional and made it so he felt like he had to comfort YOU because you feel so bad for coming/not coming sooner/ never meeting the son/not knowing coworker better

You aren’t a friend or family. You don’t know him very well or his son, don’t say “let me know if there is anything I can do!!” But if there is a specific thing that you can do (there probably isn’t!) it would be fine to offer. “I can walk your dogs on A Sunday morning if you need a sleep in because I always go for a run that day! Here is my cellphone number let me know if you want me to come and pick them up” but most likely there isn’t anything. Bring flowers and a card or a voucher for a meal delivery place. 

He’s not going to remember anything specific about this time. Grief makes it hard to form memories. He won’t remember what you brought or what you said and honestly he might not even remember that you showed up. But he might remember “a lot of people let me know that they cared and were thinking about me and my family” and that connection to humanity will help keep him anchored to his life,

Go and be part of that anchor. "
"You aren’t helping your children by staying in an unhappy marriage. Children observe and see things more then you think. Just because they aren’t physically in danger doesn’t mean watching the cold emotional failing of their parents relationship isn’t going to affect them mentally.If they think this is what marriage means they could easily fall into the same cycle of staying in situations that make them unhappy when they are older. I strongly suggest a therapist with or without your wife to figure out how to fix (if she is willing) or end the relationship. It’s okay to stand up for yourself and teach your kids that they deserve to be treated well, respected and loved . I am not saying divorce won’t be hard on them or you but I think you should keep in mind they aren’t dumb and all the fighting and distance in your marriage isn’t going un noticed . Seek some counselling before you make any decisions and they can help you. Good luck! "
"I know you like talking to your mom daily, but doing so is leaving you open to her tirades. Perhaps develop other people you can talk to about your anxieties/whatever? Because using your mom for this function isn't working out at all. 

Look up Captain Awkward ""difficult people,"" #362 in particular. These might help you develop scripts/ways of thinking about and interacting with your mom that will help keep you feeling sane."

"He now thinks he can slip right into bed with her AND get caught in bed with her with zero repercussions whatsoever.

OP, for the love of yourself, tell you parents, tell someone! The next step in his plan is unequivocally RAPE/SEXUAL ASSAULT of some sort.

Think about you for now, and protect you at all costs."
"I agree for the most part. People makes stupid decisions or change. It doesn't mean they've been lying or hiding under a mask the whole time

If someone assaults you though, the past isn't as important as getting yourself safe so it doesn't even matter if they had a mask on."
"He didn't almost hit you, OP, HE HIT YOU. You're in an abusive relationship and it seems like he's starting to escalate. You need to get out of it as soon as you can. Stay safe, OP."

"Also, CBT isn't for everyone. If you look at it very crudely, there's a ladder from behavioural through cognitive behavioural to cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy models require a level of self awareness and grasp of concepts that not everyone has, so while a therapist might recommend cognitive (-behavioural) therapy to a postgrad, they might not to a gardener with the same problems (or to a postgrad showing extremely low levels of self awareness). Therapy is not a one size fits all sort of thing and in my opinion, a first therapist should always look at what the patient needs and refer them if needed. Those referrals are where it goes wrong because there's this giant taboo on referring (in my country at least), as in you only do it when you feel you're out of your depth intensity wise. Which is bullshit and a stupid status quo, because it makes the situation such that a client, who is usually in a vulnerable state and at least somewhat confused and looking for help, needs to be guarding their own interests and signalling the need for a different approach if necessary.

Therapy is personal. Stand up for yourself, be straightforward and ask your therapist if the therapy you're getting right now is the best fit for you, in their professional opinion, and if you're not convinced, go elsewhere. "
"I am so sorry you are  getting bullied for being your artistic self. I know it doesn’t make you feel any better, but I was bullied severely when I was in high school. But once I got out of high school, everything was better.

Keep playing, do not stop. Your race and ethnicity does not dictate what sort of music you should be playing or listening to. You should play what you enjoy, and also what you are good at playing.

Once you are in college none of that will matter. 

Edited to add: btw are you aware of Samuel Coleridge Taylor? "
"You went back on your word. He's shitty and so are you.

"What these people forget is that domesticated dogs' natural lives are to work alongside humans. They're not wolves or foxes, they genuinely enjoy having jobs. Little lap dogs were usually bred to be guard dogs which is why so many little old ladies' dogs get snappy at strangers- they're just doing their job as best they can with the limited guidance they've had. 

Horses are the same, they also like to have jobs. About the only domesticated animals who don't care are cats, but they are a special CATegory all of their own. "
"So she can insult you. 

If I told you, ""Please let me come to your house so I can scrutinise your home and life and pass judgement, because insulting you and your work sounds like a really nice way to spend an afternoon,"" would you invite me over?

"You absolutely do deserve better. Your baby deserves better than to grow up watching their parent be degraded, disrespected, and abused on a regular basis. Pain is not an excuse to treat another person like garbage.

Because the doctors told her she wasn't? It's the first sentence of her comment lmao
Of course you can have a close friend.  That doesn't mean every close friendship is appropriate.   The OP's husband has actually left his marriage a hollow shell while he's maintained his relationship with Amy.   
"Hey OP, her being there is a factor in the utilities, but I wouldn't jump to that immediately if you don't have anything to base your summer electric prices on... 

I live in FL and in an apartment that is about 10 years old with similarly dated all electric appliances and our power bill is about $65 higher in the summer. (I can't imagine having a bill under $100, damn). Just my 2¢ "
"She doesn’t feel comfortable paying off a house she has no ownership of? That’s exactly what renting is, paying off your landlords mortgage. Which is what she is doing now renting with her sister

I wouldn’t let a girlfriend live in your house rent free that results in losing income. 

Think about it logically , Assuming you want to marry someone in the future , you still haven’t decided if you want her to be your wife hence why she is still your girlfriend and not a fiancé or wife.

It sounds harsh but she could not be your girlfriend in the future and you would have lost a heap of money and financially invested in a relationship that ended .

She should pay rent regardless because if you did marry then all incomes and investments go into one pot and are equal. If she is serious about this relationship then she wouldn’t mind paying rent for something that could be her future and instead of paying rent for a  landlord 

If you break up, then she rightfully paid her fair share for living under that roof for that period of time

"
"She isn't.  Discouraging as it may be though, i believe that you can find someone. You wont find someone if youre sitting at home and feeling discouraged. I know it sucks,  but the hard truth is that dating takes work and a lot of effort.  Just keep at it,  we often meet people when we least expect it.  "
"Sorry tis happened to you man. That's fucked up. A BJ to one guy and leaving with a different guy when she is suppose to be getting married? She added the guy on FB because she palns on going back for more. Fuck her! Hell no! I'd just leave. Tell her why if you must.

Make sure you screen shot and keep all evidence you have. She'll deny everything but then you have proof to throw at her and protect your good name when she trash talks you to your friends and family."
"And I'm actually terrified for that little girl. She probably has no idea what happened to her. She probably doesn't feel like she can tell anyone. And she probably also doesn't know how to stop it if she gets brought over to the house again, and the son pushes for it again. Her parents have no clue this has happened and will probably bring her over again and again. So she gets brought to a house where the father wants to buy his son condoms and a kama sutra to use on her poor 10 year old vagina. I honestly feel like I'm about to be sick thinking about it. I feel so scared for that girl. If your husband saw that girl trying to get out of your son's room, I wonder if he would try and convince her to stay and be sexual with your son, or even block her path out. Please tell her parents, OP. Someone has to protect her from your sick husband who wants her little undeveloped body to be used to satisfy his bizarre sexual mental issues."
"cheaters usually believe the other spouse is cheating too, since it was so easy for them to do everyone in the relationship must be cheating right!? "
"I'd flat out tell him that. No little remarks, no complaints about smelly clothes. Just ""hey, I know it's embarrassing when you mess up like that, but next time, please clean up after your mistakes."" 

But really, the washer isn't your problem. What REALLY stinks is both of your communication skills. "
"You may not want to hear this but it sounds to me like she needs to see a doctor or therapist. This sounds like some crazy version of post partum depression. I would be afraid for your kid. As a parent you need to do something to protect your kid. Man this is tough. 
"
"My exH used to do the same; belittle me for using a $5 word, or asking what the word means in an attempt to catch me using a word I didn’t know the meaning of. 

This behavior extended into other areas of our relationship, of course. Especially, as time went on.  He’s an ex for some very good reasons. "
"You've met other human beings in the past, right?

Your job is not to interrogate her to determine if she is a ""good fit"" for your brother. Your brother has already done that vetting and feels she's a good enough fit with him to decide that it's time to meet the family. If you happen to form an opinion that there's something seriously wrong with her, you can figure out what to do with that info down the road."
"You are not responsible for your mother's debt. I remember being so poor that even $20 seemed like a Godsend. You have every right to feel betrayed. It was yours that you worked for. But you also mention she is actively trying to pay you back. If she's otherwise a good mother try to give her a break on this. Poverty and fear are scary things. Money mismanagement is irresponsible but it doesn't make her a terrible person. 

I'm guessing you're more upset about the deception around it though. That needs to be addressed and made clear is not ok. "
"The doctor is guessing. People can hang on for a surprisingly long time in surprisingly bad condition. OP wants to sign up to be responsible for her long term care. She won't be able to extricate herself if mom hangs on 6 months, or a year or 2 years. She will be the one who knows the doctors and the meds and everything about her care. It would be one thing if she wanted to go a couple weeks at a time but she is talking long term move where she leaves him with a house full of her foster animals to take care of in her absence. 

&gt; We foster for me. 

My advice would be to move mom to where they live so she can be with her husband, continue to take care of her animals and care for her mom. "
"Think of some random guy OP. Think of a man who dates a 17 year old when he’s 25. Who doesn’t try in life, who slacks but pushes his much younger partner to do what he thinks she should do. Who has an excuse for everything, still, by 27. 

He’s a loser. He will remain a loser. Don’t be the woman who stays with someone like this OP. It’s a cliche. Get out. Live your life. Grow and meet new people, better yourself, be the person you want to be. He won’t grow. He won’t. He doesn’t want to. But he will be content for you to carry him. 

No boundaries and no drive. Leave. "
"You could start a GoFundMe to get this neglected dog a real home, and name your roommates, with pics. Works well in small communities. May as well find another place for yourself while you're at it. Theft it and release the funds only after Neglecto's reputation is ruined. "
"Can I just ask: is it possible that he did cheat, but this is an elaborate way to try to cover it up? It seems like such a stupid thing to do that I’m wondering if he’s not just trying to cover his ass really shittily."
"I wish this comment were higher. I thought I had deactivated my old OK Cupid account, until a friend texted me after having sent me a message, seeing me online and realizing that someone seemed to have taken my profile and was using it/my pictures after talking to the person controlling it and realizing that they didn't get any of our 'in' jokes. I had to reset everything on it, remove my personal info and go through a long process to delete it."
Everyone is a little bit lacking in one of these area's at any point in their life. We make these mistakes all the time and it is on us to in a kind manner inform and  correct other people when they are being unreasonable to us.

"You work full time have a part time job and do all the housework? I’m glad your husband has time to pursue his hobby, but no wonder you don’t have time for yours. He needs to do stuff around the house otherwise you are going to become resentful of him. "
"Yeah, I think you should tell him that his family is claiming you said this to him and you're really confused because you don't remember it. That's a pretty loaded statement for you to forget saying. It really sounds like they're jealous and trying to compete for his attention."
"Even if that was actually a personality trait and not a *shared interest,* do you think your story is so incredibly common it debunks the idea that *personalities aren't visual*? That people often see random memorabilia and then track the owner down to date them?"
"You are dismissive by thinking  that her idea of a night in for her celebration wasn’t good enough. 

She has already compromised, by going out fine dining with you three times a month. That is probably about all you are going to get at this point. Anything more is not a compromise, but a capitulation. 

The way you compromise in this situation is by going out with your own friends, and giving your girlfriend some solitude.  If you do not feel that her compromise is good enough, you are probably not compatible."
"There isn’t a happy ending for you here, sorry.


These people you’ve met through your girlfriend are primarily *her* friends. That doesn’t mean that they don’t like you or don’t consider you a friend, but they are her friends first and your friends second. It is really hard to stay friends (or at least close friends) with both partners after a breakup. It’s awkward, it’s really hard to not pick sides or play favorites, and it can be hurtful to your friend to stay friends with their ex. And your girlfriend also will get all the sympathy because *she* was the one broken up with and *she* is the one who was hurt. 


Your best bet is to try to stay friends with her more casual friends or acquaintances, but I wouldn’t expect to stay close with most of her friends or any of her close friends.   

But *please* don’t use this as a reason to keep dating her. Use your experience getting to know her friends to make new friends and expand your own social circle. "
"I agree that it may well not have been intended as a reminder of OP's mum, but the fact that the friend doubled down when Dallas was clearly incredibly upset is the problem. Indeed, the fact that the friend didn't seem to accept/understand why it could be seen as upsetting suggests it may have been intentional.

 Making a joke with a gift that goes horribly awry is unfortunate but it happens sometimes. Making a crying, stricken pregnant woman take photos with said gift is, at best, staggeringly insensitive and selfish. The proper response would have been to comfort Dallas and immediately offer to exchange the shirt for something more appropriate"
"I would recommend finding someone in your local area who offers these kinds of courses. Using a weapon needs face-to-face *long term* training with a professional. I can't emphasize that enough. Movies and cultural impressions have made it seem like it's not that hard to safely defend yourself with a weapon, but there are a lot of dangers associated as well.


Look, no offense, but you're a guy who did not believe her lived experience when she told you it's common. Why *would* anyone bring it up to you before? Women are constantly told ""not all men"", ""I would never do that"", ""is it really that common"", ""it's not that big of a problem"". 


It's not something I actively discuss with the guys in my life either. Usually because I get one of the above responses, de-legitimizing or devaluing what I'm trying to say. "
"Awful advice. You don't confront someone who is already behaving inappropriately, especially when they probably want to have sex with or abduct you, or both. You tell the police now and your parents and let the police deal with it."
"That sounds like a really tough situation, but it seems like he’s given you your answer, which is that he isn’t someone who will stand by you and be supportive in tough times. How much time do you want to devote to a fair-weather boyfriend? Plus it sounds like this relationship is, what, less than six months old and he’s already being secretive and giving signs of cheating on you? I would get out of there. Sorry about the pregnancy situation, that sounds really distressing. "
"Your friend is probably gay or bi and afraid of those feelings, so much so that it took truly loving a man to make him confront them. It’s an unfortunate situation but he’s your best friend and you guys need to have a talk. 

This same situation happened to my female friend’s straight sister, where her good female friend confessed feelings for her. She turned her down saying she’s not gay, but it was still difficult for her to see the friendship the same. 

The most important thing about this is to communicate. You’re not gay and not interested in him in that way and never will be. Make it clear you value the friendship an incredible amount but if this is something he can’t accept, you two should spend some time apart so he can confront his feelings. Also, as a friend, you might want to bring up him reconsidering the marriage. Tbh I’ve seen it before where gay men afraid of their sexuality marry a woman to try and live straight and it doesn’t work. "

"Don't go to the wedding and don't feel bad, but understand that their personal schedules may have required this day. When choosing my wedding day, we scoured over our schedules and determined that we wanted to ensure that we were on our honeymoon on a certain holiday for the free vacation day. That meant that we literally had a three day period that we could schedule our wedding."
The consensus is that you drop the FRIENDSHIP.  Not that you drop the subject.
"Meh, I'd say more real life obligations. 

OP's brother isn't being manipulative here. He's planning HIS life and spending HIS money to invite others to celebrate. "
"Heh, ok, your OP alone made me think you should dump him.  But the more I read your replies, it makes me wonder how you got to 3 years at all.  He's got tons of baggage surrounding his family, he's wildly insecure, and is vastly unsupportive regarding your education, which is nearly certain to translate to your career.  Not to mention the whole no student loans thing is very controlling.  I'm not seeing any redeeming qualities here."

"It's important that you not soften the language at all.

"But you still used his miles under his name, so it again falls into the camp of “he’d be kind to split it but it’s not an obligation.” 

You’re also not “paying for your ticket and his” because a buddy program doesn’t work like that. If you weren’t using his miles, you’d be paying full price anyways without an extra free ticket since you weren’t enrolled.

Anyways this is a good lesson to get your own miles account and don’t use other people’s in the future. In my experience it always causes a lot of drama because the account holder can’t equally divide up things like air miles or points or what have you. It’s hard to put monetary value on these things and airline perks can be really random and arbitrary."
"Option 4. Buy the gift and explain to girlfriend that there's no pressure to meet the daughter, that you just wanted to do something nice. "

"You're right. I don't think she would actually back down or rethink what happened. She'd most likely either not respond to me or come back with something even worse. 
It does suck to lose friends, especially those that have been in your life and memories for so long... but this one is just not worth it. In just those few months I stopped talking to her, I feel so much better, instead of sad or missing her. I actually feel better about myself without her in my life in any way."
"male and female bodies are soOOoOOooOOooo different that girls just dont feel the same way boys do.

for example:  my orgasms arent blasts of pleasure like the average man,  (i'm a girl) mine are more like waves that dont reach the excitement and explosion that men get. 

my partners can hardly get me off, if i do, sometimes it takes a vibrator.  dont worry about it. I know you want to make her feel good, but its just added pressure.  "

"You're bothered because you have a 3rd roommate that you didn't sign up for. The incremental cost of electricity and other utilities isn't the main issue, it's the disrespect of your roommate and his SO taking over your shared spaces, and assuming that you're just ok with another person living there. 

I think you should talk to your roommate and set ground rules. For starters, it's completely unfair to have her over when he's not even home. That is 100&amp;#37; treating it like 'her' place, and if she's living there she should be contributing to rent and utilities. Second, you should set a max number of nights she can stay over - they should sleep at her place a few nights a week if possible too. Maybe 3-4 nights a week? Up to you to determine what you think is fair.

  
At the end of the day, you guys just need to have a conversation about it and agree to what is fair. If you suddenly had an SO that was also staying over and basically living there, your roommate probably wouldn't be too pleased either,so the rules need to apply to both parties. "
Ya He sounds like a keeper... I cringed so hard at that message lol
"This isn’t really the advice OP needs. They need to be able to set boundaries with their mother and for her to listen to them. At the very, very least, OP’s mother needs to know who the party is really for. 

If this is mother’s party, OP needs to tell her that this is no longer OP’s. Bring that fact out into the open. I would personally refer to it as a family reunion and NOT a birthday party for OP, even to OP’s mother. 

It’s not okay for someone to hijack your birthday just because they want to do something *really* *great* while they hijack it. "
What a shitty parent he is. And you're not much better honestly. None of this is acceptable. You're meeting his kids only 6 months in by surprise and you think it's perfectly fine to get married and totally drop a bomb on their lives when you've been dating under 2 years. You are not mature enough to be in a relationship with someone with children and he is not ready to be dating if he can't put his kids first.
So she should just continue to be rolled over by this person who rudely invited someone without even asking first?  No way.  OPs expressed that she does not consider this other person a friend.  If this person invited someone else without OPs permission they are the one that messed up and it's not OPs responsibility to accommodate people she did not want or expect to come to her family's vacation home.
"Alcohol isn't creating this side of him, its suppressing his inhibitions and allowing him to act on the things he already feels. He swears at your eight-year-old cousin over losing at go fish! You've tried to talk to him and he's unwilling to change. It doesn't help that your mutual friends normalize this behavior.

For me his behavior would be a deal-breaker. You have to make your own choices, of course. It can be hard when the people around you see things a different way, but you don't have to be okay with it just because your friends minimize it. However, it isn't realistic to think he will change when he's told you flat-out that the issue is you being uptight. The choice is between tolerating this behavior or moving on."
Use the kid as a way to send a message to your wife. That's not passive aggressive at all. /s
I completely agree with this. Everyone saying the festival is more important- why? It seems to be a yearly event for one. For two she will still get all of the planning experience and simply miss out on the day- she can still be HEAVILY involved in this day without being present on the day- and training someone else to take her place will also be great experience as well. A wedding is once in a lifetime. There are lot of people insinuating this won’t be the case which is fucking rude when we do not know this couple and their relationship at all- I think we should assume the wedding will be the brothers only wedding- in which case she should absolutely be present. 
"&gt;you need to show how you aren't a flake and how reliable and fabulous you are in all things work-related.

It is *not* flakely to miss a work event for a sibling's wedding, provided you start planning for it as soon as possible and ensure a smooth transition. She can show how reliable and fabulous she is through her succession planning. No reasonable employer would have a problem with this as long as her successor is fully competent and prepared."
"At some point, he could be making rules about you seeing your mom. It doesn’t get better. He would maybe say something like “why are you doing things with family and not me, I made this [video game]sacrifice to spend more time with you and all you do is leave me to spend time with other people!” "
"This situation suuuuuucks. ):

He shouldn't go through with the wedding if he's in love with you, and not his fiance. So, that's the first thing. Tell him he needs to talk to his fiance if he needs extra time before the wedding, and that it's okay to put the wedding on hold if they need to talk it out, it's important everybody's on the same page BEFORE making such a big legal decision, not after. Also ask his permission to talk with your girlfriend about it, so you're not betraying his trust by outing him to everybody. You can clarify he's your best friend, you'll always be there for each other, but you're straight and love your girlfriend, and aren't interested in the relationship being a sexual one."
Where did you even get this from? Where did OP talk about the division of chores? 
"This is not a good idea. It will cause problems and they will likely be against it, not to mention she’s 15. You’re almost 18. This is just a no go, definitely just end it now. "
"You try to use your money to win arguments. It fails because she's not an idiot and has self respect. If you have a problem with what she's doing, explain why, how it makes you feel, etc. Communicate like an adult. Don't try to fall back on entitlement from having done something completely unrelated for her. It (understandably) makes her resent you and is probably undermining the whole relationship. You can't trust or be fully comfortable around someone who's constantly waving a power imbalance in your face. "
"Yes this is spot on.  My mother in law went to the neighbors and asked if she could borrow a bottle of ketchup cause she was making spaghetti that night and she forgot to pick some up at the supermarket.  Needless to say, my man's standards for food are much lower than mine and the recipes he does know are not okay with me. So I took over 100&amp;#37; of the cooking and he cleans the dishes.  Boom, done."
Children that age often provoke dogs. That's actually somewhat normal behavior for a 3 year old and it's one of the reasons you don't leave a 3 year old with a dog unsupervised. OP messed up very badly. You cannot expect a very young child who doesn't even live with the dog to understand dog behavior. She should learn how to behave around dogs but it's not her fault or her parent's fault that she doesn't yet.

Oh good. Glad to know that's just fiction. 
I’m not married but honestly masturbating is a quick and easy way to go. I love sex don’t get me wrong but masturbating gets you to that same point without the sex. It’s less time consuming honestly. Unless your wife specifically says so don’t take it as her not wanting sex. Just like guys jerk off. Girls vibrate. 
"If you're going to be nice about it, you want a two pronged approach:

a) Find a ritual you can do with Stan, that's Stan time. Can you bring snacks and go sit and talk with him on his porch? If possible, do it on his territory (so you can leave) keep it short, and do it on a regular basis. Asking him stuff about himself is catnip for lonely people, and you want to feed his desire for attention as vigorously as possible. However, when you're done, just be done, ""it's been nice visiting, I've got to go now!"" and leave.

b) When you want to work on your thing, and he comes over, face him up close, and be kind but direct: ""Stan, this is my project, and I want to do it my way, without you helping or correcting me. I'll come visit you for coffee this afternoon when I'm done gardening. Please go home."" Don't ignore him and get back to work, stand up facing him until he leaves. If you're at a serious impass, and you can't wait him out, then pack up your tools and go inside.
You can repeat yourself in this part, but don't add anything new or defend yourself verbally, just go back to ""because I want to do it alone"" like a broken record. You can lead him by the elbow out of your yard and say ""please leave my yard now"" if you have the gravitas to pull that off.

However hard it is to get him gone, do keep your promise for a later visit, and be all sunshine about it.

It's crucial that you don't back down and let him stand around in your yard, once you've set the limit. Part a) is about feeding his social needs while keeping you in control of your time. With some structure to it, he will understand that you'll have time for him at your pleasure, but that he can't force his way in."
"I’d take a look at legally what is the best option for you as well.

If you are considering firing someone it is often better to get them on a documented Performance Improvement Plan first.

From a business standpoint, it protects you from being sued. From a person standpoint, it gives him every opportunity to see that his behavior is poorly affecting his work. Surprisingly, even though you’ve told him verbally, many unaware people would say they were “completely caught off guard” if you fire them without documentation."
Thought so.  I would be pretty annoyed this ticket is going to waste.
"Your comments are maddening to be honest. They are diverting/avoiding at best and you don't really seem to own up to the responsibility you have towards your fiance.

Let's sum up the choices here:

* Keep enabling your parents to torpede your relationship, your fiance will leave your life but *thank god you have your abusive family to have your back* (this is a thing called cynicism by the way);

* Stop enabling them and grow a spine. The man *you will spend the rest of your life with will thank you* and your life will be a lot more issue free than it is now.

*You HAVE to make a choice. Standing there doing nothing will default to option 1.*"

"What is your definition of “getting away with assault”? Because I can almost guarantee a huge percentage of women posting on this subreddit have been assaulted by a male who got away with it.  I was groped multiple times by strange men where I worked (comic book shop and the mall) and had a guy I was dating grope me non-consensually (kept sticking his hand down my pants and chasing me around a house party), I’ve had men spank my ass at clubs, etc when I was a teen-20s. All these guys “got away with it.”  And I have always been a strong minded, vocal female. And this still happened.

You mean the advice is different on this subreddit? Because that’s NOT the same thing as “getting away with it.” Get butthurt about the advice difference, but don’t for a MINUTE think that somehow girls get fucking coddled in this world. "
I would have a lot more sympathy for her if she did side gigs when her hours go down. I bet op would be ok with her lack of money if she made an effort. Oh and the hair and nails gotta go! 
Agree. Not fixable.  She doesn’t care about your feelings or even general well-being it seems.  She sounds like a narcissist.  Being a stay at home mom isn’t a small luxury. It’s a private plane sized luxury.  Boggles my mind to hear someone complain about it while you shoulder the full burden of your family’s financial support.  If couples therapy isn’t helping then strongly encourage you to find your own therapist and you may need to try a few to get the right one.

"&gt;6 months ago they started going out once every 2 weeks with their kid to things like movies, dinners, amusement pars or sports games. According to him they did it because their daughter really missed them doing things as a family.

In other words, he's dating his ex-wife with a kid in tow.  They aren't a family any more.  Instead of dating his wife, he should be focused on establishing a separate relationship with his daughter."

"It sounds like both of these things are true tbh, and if op has no reason to distrust her husband then she should speak to the guy who says he saw her husband and the woman kissing, not the messenger trying to recruit her into his paranoia.

Going on a stakeout with this guy when you have no proof of cheating on your husbands end doesn’t make sense??"
"&gt;Ever since we’ve been together, we’ve basically fallen into traditional gender roles. I would prefer that we shared more of the household / emotional burden, ...

So your expectations were too low when you started out, he has lived down to them, living like a teenager instead of an actual adult partner when it comes to maintaining your household.  Now you would like to see some growth and his ""solution"" would be to move his actual mother in with you.

Women leave relationships like this after 5/10/15 years everyday.  Stop fantasizing about this man as the father of your future children and start thinking about your life today.  You can begin with some required reading about this problem:

* She Feels Like Your Mom and Doesn’t Want to Bang You""
* ""Women Aren't Nags—We're Just Fed Up

It took Matt's wife 12 years to realize that her marriage was never going to be a partnership of equals in that respect; so she left and took their kid with her.  Don't do that to yourself.   Discuss the articles with him.  If he doesn't get it, make plans accordingly."

1) Have him say no to photos, so you won’t seem like the baddie each time.

Block her. Stop seeing her. She's cheating. You want NOTHING to do with this. 
"I think ""facebook friendship"" doesn't actually mean anything at all. If he's participating in discussions where they are mean to you, or ditching you to hang out with them, that's wrong...but if they're just passively on his fb friend list I don't think that means anything. "
"One day late? No. No no no. You only tell him when you have a positive pregnancy test.

"Can we get clarification on why you want him to buy a nice house before buying a nice car? I really dont see why you would see it as such a problem to get a car first that you chose to nag (your words) at him over it several times when he was talking in excitement with you. 

&gt;  And I turned around and walked off. He never called me. Never texted me back, and clearly was not concerned that I was alone an hour away from home.

You broke up with him and walked off. Was he supposed to chase you down? If someone did that to me, I wouldve assumed they were getting another ride. "
"I know being wrong sucks especially when it means your parents were right. Honestly, you gotta bite the bullet here. An I told you so is a lot better than living with a man who has no qualms about cheating on you. Where’s your self respect? What about you? You’re so much better than this.

"I mean, would you rather he not work and be unsupervised with nothing to fill his time?"
"Stop enabling him. Give him a list of expectations, chores, a timeline to complete them, and let him know that you need his help and this is what you expect of him. Write it out with as much detail as you can. Let him know you won't be checking up or checking in with him about these things and you are going to trust him to follow through on these. Talk it out and leave some room for compromise but set a boundary and then stick to it. He has to want to change and you need to show him that he needs to if he wants to keep you. "
Why didn't you just tell her to go ahead and divorce you? 
"im sorry if this comes off as rude because it’s not my intention, but did you read the part of the post where he said she only “lets” him go out once a YEAR ? if it were me, and my partner was being controlling in such a manner (ie, i am at work or i am at home), i would find it completely hypocritical that they got to go out 12 times for my 1 (and get mad at me for even that). honestly, i would want to spend time with anyone besides her if given the chance (who wants to be around someone who resents your work and constantly brings up divorce). and considering she has no job, she has every opportunity to go out during the day and make the most of it (with the child, of course). some may argue that having the child around would make it difficult, but i think her loving spending time with them (as the post says) would mean they’re likely to have fun outside of the house. if she doesn’t go out, that is not his problem. he has a job supporting their family, he doesn’t control her, so i see no reason for once a month to be an issue on her end regarding him"
He did choose that guy over him. He's well within his right to do that and op is within his rights to act on that knowledge.
"They're *linear*. They're never logical. Watch them freak the fuck out whenever they don't get their way; that is not a logical freakout there!

That's a fair criticism. 
"Thank goodness you actually found this out now, instead of actually having a child with him, and figuring it out.

Any time someone comes here and asks ""how do I convince him? How do I get him to see my point of view?"" My answer is the same - you dont. Unless you're speaking in a foreign language he doesn't understand, you've made your points clear. In return, he has made his points clear. His actions show that he's not really going to help out too much, and his words are telling you that he'd rather have his mom move in with you then to participate in the labor of child-rearing.

He might be generous, thoughtful, loving, kind, honest, and a fantastic listener. He might be everything you want in a partner. But he's definitely not what you want in a father for your child. He's been crystal clear about that. Your choice is to either pay attention to the reality of the situation, and his words and actions, and reconsider having children with him so that you have a chance at a happy life. Or you can continue to stick your head in the sand, and pretend that it will all be okay once the baby comes, like so many people do, and live a miserable life where you do all of the work, his mother lives with you full time, and he swoops in and is the fun dad whenever he feels like it, no more, no less.

My friend married a man who was and is a big-time gamer. He plays video games more than he does anything else. She thought for sure that if they had a baby, that would change his heart and personality and he would step up and become a full partner. So they had the baby. Now, she is basically a single mother who happens to live with their financial provider. Her husband did not change in the slightest. He still plays video games all day, and when asked to even watch his child for a couple of hours, he has a ton of excuses. He says that the baby doesn't really like him that much, and honestly, the fact that he has never paid attention to her might have a little something to do with that. He has never given his child a bath, he has changed very few diapers, he doesn't even babysit. And I say babysit, because he's definitely not a full parent, and my friend doesn't trust him to watch his daughter, so she usually has a friend look after her baby if she has another obligation. 

Before they had the kid, he expressed some reservation, but did make it sound like he was going to be an equal parent. And to be fair, my friend really ignore the warning sides. He never dealt with his gaming addiction, he was never really a great partner in the marriage, but she really, honestly thought that as soon as the baby came, it would change his heart in an instant, and he would become the man she always thought he had the potential to be.

You can't really change other people. And your fiance sounds like he's been clear to you that he's not going to change, he's not going to step up.

My friend struggles a lot, but overall, she's pretty happy being a sort of single mom. She loves her daughter, and she's thrilled that she had her. But her marriage is all but over, and her daughter will never have an engaged and loving, responsible father."
"&gt; How do I get over this 

By continuing your work with your therapist - starting is the hardest part, and you've already done that! Good for you! And by avoiding the negative influence of your family on this subject. 

Have you heard the analogy of the crabs in the bucket? It boils down to - people who are unhappy hate it when others in their group start to be happy. They'd rather pull that person back down than figure out how to pull themselves up. 

Don't let them pull you down. You know yourself and you have a good support system in place. Focus on that and on the things that bring you joy in the relationship. As long as you're happier with him than without him, life is good. 

I know that doesn't help the anxiety. That's the worst thing about trying to shake off that old programming. 

One thing that can help is by having a sense of what you'd do without him. I don't mean a practical exit strategy, but knowing in your heart that -- ""yeah; if this does end, it's going to hurt, and it's going to suck, but I will survive. I have survived a breakup before and if it comes down to it, I can do it again."" -- That gives *you* power back over the situation. 

&gt;has anyone happily been with their first loves for years and years without misery?

Yes. I had a number of short-term relationships in high school and early uni, but my partner is definitely my first real love. We met when I was 19, and we'll have been married for 15 years in August (19 years together). 

We've had fights, obviously, and times when things were harder than others, but long-term relationships go like that. They cycle in and out of *passion -&gt; friendship -&gt; right now even the way you chew annoys me -&gt; oh hi, I remember why I love you -&gt; passion* and around again. 

When I was pregnant I was 100% convinced that he was going to cheat and leave me, because that's what my father did to my mother. Didn't happen. What did happen was that he encouraged me to talk about why I was in a constant panic state, helped sort out counselling options, and we worked through it together as a team. And we're still going strong. 

You've got this. Trust him. Talk to him. And trust yourself even more than that, because even if he screws up, you are strong enough to handle it. "

"More stoic advice: You should never allow someone else's success to make you feel bad. If they succeed at something through their own virtue, skills, positive traits - great, you should be glad that there is a good person achieving good things in the world! If they succeed through deceit, undercutting others and taking shortcuts, well, you have nothing to be jealous of. Real happiness isn't found from external validation of peers and fancy jobs, it comes from being the best version of yourself (i.e. the person who puts in hard work, does the right thing, is honest, is humble) so, the success of others shouldn't impact your happiness anyway."
I am in therapy. I emailed my therapist and am trying to schedule an extra session this week. We have mostly been talking about some abuse that happened to me (also my fault) but it might be time to dive into my self esteem issues. I am also on anti depressants but I admittedly forgot to take it yesterday (I take it before bed).
"&gt;**If** having bigger boobs will make her feel better about herself then she should do it.

That 'if' is the big sticking point I think a lot of posters are hitting on here. 

From OP's writing, 

&gt;I think it will make me feel better about myself

it *seems* like instead of approaching this as an enthusiastic ""bigger boobs would be awesome, I want that!"" - she *seems* to be approaching it as a means to solve an issue that's generally considered to be a (mental) self-esteem issue. 

Getting surgery to solve a self-esteem issue *might work* in some cases, but there's also a fair chance that after all is said and done, it'll turn out to just be a temporary mask for an unresolved issue that'll still exist afterwards."

"Just by not getting sexually compatible anymore I think is enough ground for divorce. She's decided she never wants sex again? That's awful. Op, you have needs, too. It's not fair.

This isnt even considering the rest of her nonsense. I think she's not going to be able to see how she needs to change until you leave, unfortunately. She'll either grow up and treat the next one better or die salty. "
"I mean man. You allow it by doing what she says. So yes, you are allowing it.

Don't waste the rest of your life with her. She's a completely different person. "
"My read on this is that your friend was acting from a place of pain. I don't think it's a personal assault or that she's trying to damage your relationship with your boyfriend. When someone is so caught up in their own pain, they won't necessarily be thinking of others. I think that she's just hurting and her damaged ego is trying to find some validation. Right now, she is confused and wondering why her ex left her. She very likely feels like she is unattractive and inadequate. Your boyfriend in this case, was simply safe and he was there. 

That said, I don't condone the behaviour. I just don't believe it was malicious in nature. I'd be inclined to say give your friend a bye on this but when she's better, have a very gentle word and remind her that whilst you forgive her this once, it is not a boundary she is allowed to cross again. She may be hurting right now, but she needs to find healthier ways of finding an outlet.

Forgive her, she needs your support right now."
Ouch. This seems shockingly plausible. You basically just described her family dynamic and her best friend has been going through a bi experience and dating around. I could totally see her having a lot of these feeling just by looking back on the conversation we had months ago. Thank you for taking the time to write this out it's actually helping quite a bit.

"You need to set extremely strong boundaries with your wife or else you may be out of a job. Your work is suffering and your boss is already aware that you have huge distractions at home. Sit her down and explain to her that you need to be absolutely undisturbed in those hours. If she tells you that you don't have a real job, point that that your ""not a real job"" pays for everything and that you are starting to feel like she doesn't respect you. After that, be firm. Lock the door and do not answer it outside of your office hours. Always refuse her demands that you stop working and do family stuff during those hours - no exceptions. You do not leave work during those hours except for coffee or bathroom breaks. Tell your daughter directly that daddy has to work and that you can't play with her right now and that she can't disturb you. Then soundproof the door and/or the room so that if she does start banging on the door when you're in the middle of a phone conference, the other participants at least won't hear her. Get some noise-cancelling headphones so YOU can't hear the banging. She can text or e-mail you if an emergency occurs. Someone else also mentioned putting something on the door to indicate when you are approachable and when you aren't so that she at least won't interrupt telephone conferences. If you're extremely firm on these points, she will eventually get the point. I would give it a month or so and if you can't get through to her, you might have to go back to commuting or rent an office somewhere nearby. You would still get to sleep later and get home earlier. I kind of wonder whether you going back to commuting might be her intent anyway, because of the pay cut.

I've worked from home for 25 years and I don't have this problem with my husband, luckily, as he works from home once a week and for longer infrequent periods inbetween projects. It works with mutual respect for the other person's time. I have occasionally had to set boundaries with neighbors, which has led to a few hurt feelings along the way (especially 20 years ago, when I encountered people who couldn't conceive that a woman at home would be doing anything other than housework and simply didn't respect my time)."
"&gt;He sent a photo of me in lingerie to an online artist to commission a drawing of me.

Hi, full-time freelance and commission artist here. Receiving these photos for reference material without warning is super fucking uncomfortable, and I think I'd be even more disgusted to find out it was done without the subject of the photo's consent. This is a HUGE RED FLAG. If he had no issue sharing an intimate but dressed photo of you without your consent, I'd hope and pray he didn't share your nudes with anyone else without your knowledge or consent. If he goes nuclear when you decide to break up (I'm not saying ""if."" PLEASE break up with this guy), and you have evidence that he's done this, you can possibly get him for revenge porn, but IANAL.

On top of everything else, your boyfriend is displaying so many other red flags. Do yourself a favor: RUN. Get the hell away from this dude. He sounds like an abuser in the making, and the constant disrespect of your boundaries speaks VOLUMES. Fuck what your father says: Ben is showing dangerous behavior and you two are not compatible. Go with your gut.

EDIT:

&gt;the amount he does this makes me feel really over sexualised and quite frankly, its annoying.

This is objectification. It's a way of making you feel dehumanized and eventually trying to break you into giving in to this behavior and dealing with it. It is extremely degrading- that is why you feel uncomfortable. Do not let him do this. Slap his hand away, embarrass him in public (yell ""I TOLD you not to touch me in [x place]!""), and make sure he knows that his behavior will not fly. Ideally, just dump the dude, and ghost him- and make sure you've deleted your nudes off his phone and/or computer if possible before doing so."
"You can continue to think that you are inadequate compared to her previous lovers. Or perhaps you can just try to listen to what she wants or doesnt want. I bet you that if you just try for a better sex life for you and her, you'll be far more attractive than you think you are. Realise that in this situation, and most, the only thing that is really holding you back is you."
"It is 100% fair to ask her to avoid certain acts you feel discomfort performing. Even if you're good at them, it won't feel good if youre miserable the whole time. Thats why you work TOGETHER to find things you both want to do! 

You need to know that you definitely need to be comfortable talking about the specific acts of sex and how they make you feel to have a better sex life that you find satisfying. That is not negotiable. The alternative has led you here, where you will stay until you can change. 

You don't say you'll never ever do those things. You say you want to work towards doing those things after becoming more comfortable in your sex life together, building more intimacy and trust. Over time, those associations will likely fade and you will be able to replace those bad memories with good ones of the same acts! But you need time to get there. And you need to get wayy more comfortable in your ability to please your GF and be pleased in return. 

Speaking for your own needs does NOT make you a selfish asshole. Repeat that until it sticks. You're clearly interested in pleasing her as well so you're, by definition, not selfish. Just start SLOW. Talk about things, no holds barred. Do things you both agree that you want to do. Do those things until you feel comfortable adding in some other stuff. Talk about that stuff. Do that stuff. Repeat cycle as many times as you want! You can do it. "

"""Get your shit together before it's too late"" is some pretty solid relationship advice."
"Hey there, I'm on a throwaway but this is kind of ""my"" question to answer.... I'm celebrating my 20th wedding anniversary this year with a spouse who is EXACTLY like this. 

There are 4 main things I'd like to say. 

1) In case no one else has said it (I Haven't read all the comments), this is a common issue in relationships to varying degrees and has a name. Your husband is co-dependent. At least now you have the term for it so you can discuss it, google it etc. 

2) Your husband will almost certainly take it as a personal offense or an indication you don't love him enough or something similar when you try to discuss these issues. With this in mind I STRONGLY recommend that you find a marriage counselor to go see together. In my case it got bad enough that I decided about 3-4 years in, that I wanted a divorce over just not having a life anymore, but my wife convinced me she was willing to change and we sought out a counselor. Since then we've had maybe 7-8 counselors (mostly because they seem to retire or move after a short while!).  What a good counselor will do is talk to you both as a third party about how you can make things better (suggestions given by a trusted third party carry so much more weight than those from someone we love for some reason, but its' true). 

If you find a counselor but feel like you don't get on or s/he is not being effective, THIS DOESN'T MEAN COUNSELLING ISN'T THE ANSWER! It just means that that wasn't the right counselor for you guys. Like any other profession there are good and bad counselors, also an individual's communication style and how you guys ""gel"" with them can make all the difference. 

3) If you can, get him to read a copy of the book ""Co-Dependent no more"" by Melodie Beattie. Our counselor recommended it for my wife and although she's not much of a reader she read it (fearing divorce). Between our counselor explaining to her that she was co-dependent and what that meant, and this book, she finally understood WHY there was a problem. This didn't fix the problem overnight by a long way, but it lead to the monumental first step of her realizing it WAS a problem and not just that her spouse doesn't love her enough (which was the frame of reference up to that point, in her mind, happy couples always did things together). 

4) This one is HUGE and it's for you, not him. The other thing our first (amazing) counselor did was sit me down and make me realize that I'm part of the problem.... When I look at the language you use here I can see that you feel like it's his problem that's affecting you. Well here was my wake up call... I was feeding it, and so are you. Every time my wife complained because I wanted to stay an extra hour or two after work to have a team-building drink with my co-workers, or wanted to go see a friend to do something she had no interest in doing it went the same way. I'd ask if it was okay to go, already knowing the answer and she'd say she didn't want to that happen (in whatever way she chose to communicate that) and I'd say okay, feel more resentment and not go..... 

I was making the decision not go. I was doing that because of what I'd have to deal with if I did go and because of the guilt I'd feel... but it was MY decision and the counselor helped me realize that I played a huge part in this process, I had the agency to change things too. 

You're going to have to sit down with your partner and explain to him that you've been making a mistake in your relationship, that it's normal and healthy for people in a relationship to do things without the other. It give them things to talk about and connect over. Explain that you're going to fix this problem in yourself and that this means you will be going out more and that it'll be difficult at first but it'll get better for both of you and suggest he find a hobby or friends to do the same with (he almost certainly won't but take the opportunity to get him thinking about doing it anyway). 

After this, if you want to go out and he is uncomfortable with it, have a quick check in with yourself... if the thing you're going to do reasonable, i.e. it doesn't step on other specific time commitments you have with him, it's for a reasonable amount of time doing something reasonable (I wouldn't use the time to go to any strip clubs right now!), if you can put your hand on your heart and tell yourself it's something a normal healthy couple would do (e.g. going out for a coffee with a friend without him or something), then go. Tell him that you love him but the time away you're asking for isn't unreasonable so you're going to take it, then go. The first few times there's likely to be huge sulks or knock-down-drag-out-fights where guilt will be thrown around heavily, which is going to be really tough to hear because you love him, but also to be expected (after all, you've spent the entire relationship to this point living within his comfort zone and catering to his boundaries and now you're completely moving the goalposts unilaterally and it will rightly feel unfair to him, but that'll just take time to get over). 

I'm now 20 years in and we still have those ""I don't want you to go"" conversations sometimes but they're very few and far in between. My wife still has very few friends that she sees without me and no real hobbies, but she is better at that than when we started. Like any other major issue, it will probably never be completely fixed, you'll probably never be the perfectly happy couple that comes free with picture frames, but you'll get to a point of compromise where both of you are happy most of the time. 

I hope this was helpful, please feel free to PM me or whatever if there are further questions. "

"You seem like a decent, respectful guy trying to do the right thing, which I appreciate.

I'm white and my husband is Asian, just so you know where I'm coming from. I feel like your post itself, and some of your comments, show you may not know a whole lot about racism, and the lived experience of nonwesterners in the west. I don't mean that in an insulting way; no one knows everything, we all have to start somewhere, and I appreciate you recognizing that something didn't seem right and doing your part to do the right thing. 

I would really encourage you to start researching and learning more about modern day racism, what it looks like, and what combatting it looks like. And, well, for those of us in interracial relationships, the onus is on those of us with privilege to make sure we learn, listen, and are doing our part to stand up for our partners. 

There is a -ton- of information on the internet written by people of colour, written by Asian Americans on what racist micro aggressions (and not so micro) looks like. The more you're willing to learn, the better equipped you will be to a) recognize racist attitudes earlier b) support your girlfriend (without talking over her of course!) and c) deal with this kind of stuff.

I hope that didn't come off as patronizing; I really don't mean to be. "
"They paid for part of our wedding, yes. We paid for a sizable percentage ourselves. The thought has crossed my mind that part of this is expected as a repayment of sorts."

"Same. If anyone needs to learn how to be a proper ally, it's a person in a relationship with a black person. They're young though so hopefully they'll both grow out of it - for her part that she will be more discerning with her partners.

"For my grandparent's 60th they got all their kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids to come to their house for a weekend. All significant others were included and there were several feasts of home cooked food and beer by the river. It was an awesome time. My papa passed away 2 days before their 63rd anniversary. He also had a stroke. I'm glad your grandpa is doing well."

"You might have to go to court again and get the agreement changed where a new partner doesn't get any right to discipline the child. 

Your ex seems to be one of those who just loves watching drama from afar. You and ex fighting over him. He is a loser. Protect your child from this drama."
Surely she's only using it as a communication tool. Isn't that a good thing?
"Nope.

You knew what he was all along, you hoped for the best, and you chose to believe his fairy-tale that he was cured. But liars never, ever, ever change. I sometimes think it must be hard-wired in their brains such that they can't change.

And it's not just the lying, or the disrespect of the lying. It's that he does not respect *any* of your input, opinions, values, worries, preferences, demands, requsts, needs...  

Not to have a husband risk becoming an organ-donor by getting a bike is a reasonable preference, as is not having a new husband piss off for months at a time and keep moving around in the services. But he just *doesn't care* what you want. 

Let that sink in. He literally doesn't care what you want, and he has no intention of ever considering it, let alone take it into account.  You have to wonder at what point he planned on telling you he'd been accepted into the Air Force, assuming he ever is. Presumably he was going to just wait till you wondered where he was. Or was going to present it as a fait accompli.

I don't think counselling will achieve anything. I'd go direct to divorce.

Sorry."
"&gt;  As a general rule, if you want an amazing boyfriend, you need to learn how to be an amazing girlfriend.

&gt; Realize that if he's going to leave you for someone else, he will. This is not something you have control over. 

Come now, you can't both have no control and control. 

This is how people get so jaded and hate cheaters, people put their being into making someone happy then they fuck around anyway. 

Also the suggestion someone rewards bad behavior with being nicer will never go down well. "
Wanted to make sure someone said this!! He definitely messed around with his friend and was trying to get around the guilt by getting her permission afterwards/during.
"Before we got married, we lived with both sets of parents (they live in different states). I only made it 6 months with my in laws before I had to leave because I was on edge all the time and had nowhere I could relax. They love me and we're so kind, but they had a lot of rules (we weren't allowed to be in the same room with the door shut etc.) 

We saved a lot of money there but I was super unhappy. My then boyfriend wanted to stay because we were saving and he wasn't as unhappy as I was. He was comfortable and safe and getting out on our own is scary after comfort for such a long time. 

Eventually, I had had enough. It may have been a bit different because it was before we married, but I said I was done, I was moving out, he was welcome to come. I showed him all the apartments I looked at and the one I finally chose. I showed him my predicted weekly income based solely on my own income, which was much lower than his. I showed him my savings plan. I didn't do anything to sneak behind his back, and he was welcome to have input, but he wanted to stay and so didn't give any. 

I moved into my new flat and felt SO RELIEVED. My happiness improved, I had my own rules, I could wear and eat what I wanted. He didn't stay at home very long after I moved out if his parents home. He has never been a risk taker at all, so sometimes he just needs me to take the risk. 

I know that ""logically"" staying is beneficial, but anxiety is huge and mental health is more important in the long run "
"Exactly what I was thinking. He wants her to be the one to file, so he's treating her horribly. "
this reminds me of when we got rid of my daughters' pacifiers - they asked about it for one afternoon and then never again. I was really scared of how much it would suck to get rid of them and it was not nearly the big deal I thought it would be.
So you made this thread to brag that someone at work has a crush on you and hasn't acted on it? Congrats?
"You might have to reach out to a muslim sub about this because the perspective that you're going to get here will probably not be well-received.

Personally, my take on your situation is that you are incredibly insecure, petty and controlling. Your wife *shut that guy down* in the most respectable way to try to get him to leave her alone. Then she told you about it.

Your reaction was to belittle her and abuse her.

Her actions were reasonable. Yours were horrible.

I do not understand what she did that would make you lose trust in her. She simply told the guy that she was married to get him to leave her alone. I suppose that you would rather she receive harassing messages from him for the rest of her life? 

You need therapy. Your insecurity is brutally unhealthy and I'm concerned that it's going to cause you to harm her beyond the emotional abuse you are already doing to her."
"There's a stigma because sex work has a history of being damaging. Because a large number of the people involved in it were not doing so of their own free will. 

There's no oversight.  
Also, it's generally a crime. That doesn't help anything. "
My ex was an alcoholic and one time when I wouldn’t engage him in an argument he squirted the shit out of me with the bottle we used on our pets. It was actually more frightening than it sounds. I knew it might be followed by something worse. I know it’s not quite the same as this story but it reminded me of it. 
I do agree and think therapy could help. I just worry that it may be completely out of our budget at the moment and our insurance does not cover it. Thank you
"Yeah this is very strange. Tbh a lot of these experiences were very relatable to me as well, I’m 4’11”, 90ish lbs. People did similar things like this to me in elementary school and even high school. It stopped when I went to university and it definitely stopped once I started working at an office. That is a strange environment for it to still be going on like that..."
"Nothing is creepier than a father trying to take ownership of his daughter's sexuality at the age of 3.  This is probably not what is happening, but if it is, he is even creepier."
"I never said that his current feelings aren't legitimate - of course he feels blindsided, and of course he would prefer a partner who is on the same page as him about this. It's natural and understandable for him to react that way.

But if he carries on dwelling on those feelings and doesn't process them and try to accept the situation then his marriage will be over. 

I also think ""sexually settled"" is a really unhealthy and unhelpful way to represent the issue, and reflects OP's insecurities much more than it reflects what he says his wife actually said."

"Nope, this is on the adults here. You don't leave a dog alone with small children."

"You miss having a partner. You don't miss *him*. It's really important that you separate out those two things in your mind.

If you're lonely, you need to reach out to somebody else. Reach out to friends or family. Start making those bonds stronger. Date. Find meaningful connection in places that are not abusive."
FWIW I think 90kgs is impressive
I would end the relationship she is very insecure and if she hasn't cheated on you yet has already violated a number of your boundaries. 
"She keeps it under lock and key?  OP will be killed if he looks in her closet?  

Either he pitches in or he doesn’t.  Sounds like he’d rather just sit on the couch."
"&gt; I don't even get respect for my shredded body from my younger relatives either

&gt;I mostly stick to classical music anyway

Jesus. Nobody thinks you're cool because apparently you act like an asshole. 

&gt;And no I don't want to train one hour every day to get good in one of those shooter games just so I can beat him.

Beating him is not the point. I bond with my 15 year old nephew over video games and I've never once won. I suck. But the point is, we do it together.

It sounds as if your nephew doesn't think you are cool because you're a jerk who thinks he's superior to everybody."
"This was my thought, too. My boyfriend and I are both proficient enough cooks, but not great at thinking up dinner ideas, so getting the meal prep kits has helped us a ton. Not only do you have your meals planned for the week, but the directions in the kit are super easy to follow. We end up spending $10/serving, which isn't much more than fast food, and it's so much healthier and better tasting. "
My friend and I tested this the other day. Facebook will say you’re active just because someone sent you a message
A “Break” is just a poor excuse of a breakup.
He should march right up to her 2 years ago and inform her they are getting a divorce. 
"Yep. I have had to rework some weird things put into my brain by my mom and stepdads relationship. They have gotten worse and worse and I’m really sad for what my much younger brother has been taught a relationship, love, and a marriage is. "
"In my experience, you can only learn debugging by getting a lot of experience doing it because there are so many different failure scenarios. You get an intuition for most situations once you have experience, but it doesn't work if someone else solves it for you. Kind of like how you can't learn to drive without actually sitting in a car and driving.

You learn something by having someone else point out your bug, but you lose most of the learning you could've been doing. This is my anecdotal experience from having TAd intro programming for 3 years."
"op, is this really the man you want to have children with? step back for a minute here. you're engaged. you have time to call it off. you have time to walk away without anyone getting hurt. these are the kinds of conversations you need to have if you want to have kids with him, and if he's showing you his true self, you need to listen. his behavior won't change when you marry him or have kids or introduce any other new aspect to your relationship. take him on his word and if this is how he is *planning* to have a child, it doesn't sound like he is the husband or co-parent for you."
"Fans are fine. I need one too.

Sleeping with mom in these circumstances -not fine. Weird. Red flag that their relationship is way too close. "
"&gt;Am I being too demanding to insist that she not sleep with her cellphone beside her in the bedroom?

Dude. It's been *10 years.* If she hasn't been willing to leave her phone outside of the bedroom in 10 years, what makes you think that will change? 

She's made it clear that she wants to keep her cellphone beside her. You can't control anyone else's actions but your own. If this is a deal breaker for you, then go ahead and break the deal, but personally, it seems like a silly hill to die on. "
But the person you responded to is NOT OP's husband. Just someone who said they wouldn't be happy their wife got a boob job... 
"Thing about loans in this situation is that they need to be a one time deal.

Additional loans don't happen unless the first one is paid off. (or there is an amazing track record of paying it down.)

That first loan is a sign of good faith. If the kid doesn't live up to her end of the bargain, then the consequence is no more loans.

He should definitely assume he won't see the money again, but it is a way of giving her a chance."
He looked for a vulnerable girl he could manipulate and gaslight.
"She has unambiguously told you that she does not want to get back together with you.

Cut contact with her, no more housesitting or getting intel from her friends or hugs or even chatting. Give yourself time and space to move on. Look for someone new. It'll take a long time to get her out of your head, but you just need to stick it out."
"&gt; Red lipstick is apparently a woman's ""main seduction weapon"" and no one wears it just because, especially to a chill hang out in the park.

That’s interesting, I use it when I’m trying to conceal the fact that I’m goddamn exhausted. Had no idea that “I’m trying not to look dead” meant I was trying to seduce everything with a penis. 

It sounds like something else is up with your girlfriend. Either that or she has some genuinely fucked up beliefs about women. Only you’ll be able to find out which it is. What I CAN tell you is that the *worst* thing you can do is indulge this behavior. You’ve done nothing wrong here, and acting like you have will only reinforce her suspicions. "
"So now you know that maybe threesomes aren't for you. And maybe you're starting to realize that you might not be as poly as you thought. Which is perfectly okay, but I have to ask: who wanted the open relationship?"
"You've had a lifetime of cooking lessons.  She's jumping in as an adult and it can be overwhelming.  Order from a meal prep service for her nights.  All the ingredients are there with step by step instructions.  It'll take the scariness out of it for her, and you'll be eating better food"
"My best advice is to be an active listener. You are human. You're not always going to be on top of things. Let her know that, despite being human, you will always be there to hear her out if she has a grievance. The fact that you care, and that you're cognizant of your past experience is a huuuge step! It means you are, at the very least, willing to accept criticism if it comes.


Which brings me to point 2: if she is communicative, then constantly worrying about possible situations isn't healthy. You should be able to trust and take the leap that as long as you're doing work to be your best self, not only will she meet you there too, but she will tell you if you're not meeting her halfway, too."
"If you've watched Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, you reminded me of the episode ""Charlie Work.""

If you've not seen the show, the gist of the episode is this:  Charlie is the 'lovable' idiot of the group.  They're all horrible people, but Charlie is the especially dumb one.  But he and the gang run a bar, and somehow keep it in business.  This episode revolves around an upcoming health/safety inspection that Charlie is preparing for, and everyone else just blows it off because it's bogus and they always pass with no worries.

However, in this episode we see Charlie doing a flurry of work behind the scenes, ushering people in and out of specific locations, keeping certain health hazards hidden, making sure the inspector doesn't catch on to whatever bizarre and certainly unhygienic antics everyone else is up to.  He's hard at work gaming the system and making sure this inspection passes with flying colors, when by all intents and purposes the place should be immediately shut down.  And at the end of the episode, when they're given a passing score by the inspector he's over the moon with his achievement and everyone else looks at him saying, ""Of course we passed it, those things are bullshit and we always pass.""  No one sees that Charlie put in all this hard work to make sure everything worked out, and in the process even ensured that they pulled off their scam involving live chickens, airline miles, and a truckload of steaks.

So, to you, it might appear that Charlie is just winging it and flying by the seat of his pants -- this lovable idiot husband of yours charming his way to a high-paying job.  But the guy had a successful career in the military, took classes in leadership, chose a dedicated and hardworking woman as a partner, and has been able to get into a new career in a new industry and climb the ladder two rungs at a time.  While you might not be able to see it, there's certainly hard work involved there."
He lives out of state.  She doesn't HAVE to do that at all.
"She has 360k saved up. 

She’s not treating her parents like royalty, she’s helping them out, helping them survive. That’ll go a long way into helping them live decently once they can no longer work. She’s still making and saving money, she could be well into 500k of savings by the time they need to be put into a home. 

To live below your means is to have money left over, money you ideally save. You suggested she doesn’t have to live that way, but she wouldn’t have 360k saved up if she was spending as much as she earned. That numbers gonna keep growing and after the parents die, will be used to secure her future, she may even be planning for early retirement. 

But don’t fall into the mindset of “there’s 360k in savings, that’s 360k to play and have fun with”. Because going back to $0 is awful hard buddy. God forbid disaster strikers and you get plunged into debt. "
Seriously. He's just stubborn but she's hormonal? What an ass. I sure as hell hope he figures shit out quickly because this baby is going to be a rude awakening for this guy. You can't boss around a baby.
"Well, he clearly loved the relationship when she waited on him hand and foot and relied on him for everything, but now she isn't doing his laundry so he has to find a new bang maid. "
Weirdly I had this thought too. Some hero complex or need to fix.
"It seems pretty plain she is not sneaking.  She handed you her phone willingly and didn't make up any lies or bizarre excuses when confronted.  That's not sneaking around.  That she is, at worst, oblivious and a poor judge of men's intentions is an easier case to make.

Nonetheless, if you've only dated for 8 months, have had multiple blowout fights, and are drunkenly breaking up and the breaking down with each other, I think this relationship is probably not working out for either of you."
"&gt; my husband is quite a big, athletic man and I doubt I could physically hurt him,

&gt;  I know that if I actually took a real swing at someone like my husband, physically he would find it a minor annoyance.

YOU PHYSICALLY HURT YOUR HUSBAND.  You may have hurt him more emotionally, but don't get it wrong, you hurt him physically. Your five-year-old can hurt you accidentally if he stepped on your bare feet while s.he's in shoes.. Just because he may be physically stronger, doesn't mean he doesn't feel pain, and the statements above suggests you trivialize his discomfort, thus trivializing the pain he might have felt being delivered by the person he is supposed to love and trust most. He flinched, thus felt vulnerable. YOU HURT HIM.. You need to acknowledge this.

You’re not exclusive. You’re married. Married. Give it a rest. You both should seek therapy separately. And show her this Reddit thread.

"I agree with the others who want more information.  But with the little you have said it seems to me you are over reacting.  For a lot of people  a simple ""I'm sorry"" is sufficient.  If every little thing need a full blown apology I would be annoyed.  You were taught that.  She wasn't.  "

"I wrote a letter to my dad with the same logic. To this day he still uses it against me. After he copied it and handed it out to various family members to try to demonize me.

You decide who your family is. And it's the people you care about and support you."

"I'm honestly not sure where my fiance heard that from. He works from home at his computer all day, and doesn't leave the house much. He was having a lot of intrusive thoughts, and said they went away when he started taking vitamin D regularly.

 From what I have researched though, vitamin d deficiency is linked with cognitive brain function, and can also play a large role in depression. You need vitamin d for nearly every part of your body!"
"If it gets to the point where you can't express your feelings to your SO of two years, you should just end it and move on. It’s not a relationship anymore at that point.

Your gf could have a personality disorder.  She could be massively spoiled. She could be intentionally manipulating you to where you're afraid to disagree with her. 

Your gf could be any number of things. What she isn't is adult relationship material. "
Its possible that she had a pap and thought that was a general test? it's surprising how many women are unclear about what that sort of thing tests for
"But here's the thing, I honestly don't think you will leave drugs alone based on the language in your post. I don't think you even intend to try. Further, she is totally correct to be afraid of you. You're a violent drug addicted abuser and you're escalating. She should listen to her gut and run far away from you. This post is a posturing move and nothing more. You don't want to change or do better, you're just here to talk about how your behavior is not indicative of your person and to ask how to get people to treat you accordingly. Actually your actions are indicative of your person and you're being judged entirely appropriately. Leave these poor people alone and get into in patient treatment so that *some day in the far future* you can be a part of their lives."

"THIS!! I, unfortunately, picked up herpes from the first person I slept with. I was young and stupid. It was horrible. The outbreaks look like shingles (same disease really), but are concentrated on and up inside all of your naughty bits. Gave me hellish UTIs. 20 years later, I still get outbreaks, nothing like I used to, but they hurt like hell and I also feel dirty and embarrassed as well. I told my dad and he understood. I can’t ever tell my mom. I try to bury it....OP, please know, you did NOTHING wrong, you are not a bad person and if he leaves because of this, then it wasn’t worth it anyway. Trust me....I have had to have “the talk” with anyone I slept with because you can get it even while wearing a condom. Do the right thing and you will feel better. I promise."

"Yeah, the script thing, good lord. Not everybody grew up with the same script, and it's not the only way to apologize. I had an ex who was that way but about forgiveness--he was never convinced I'd really forgiven him when *he* apologized, because there was a formula in his head, and I never did figure out exactly what it was, nor did he tell me. You can't expect other people to know how you scripted a conversation in your head."

"I had an ex-girlfriend who used to do this to me. She would follow good looking male youtube vloggers and models, as well as other lesser known models and actors that she had met/worked with - and she also used to message them (*for friendly reasons*). It used to make me feel like utter shit, and I completely understand your situation. Similarly to you, I wouldn't class myself as an ugly person. I'm ever-so slightly overweight but it isn't as noticeable because I have a bulky physique from when I used to lift weights, but obviously I am nowhere close to the perfect hair/body/jawline that some of these guys sported.

Regardless of whether it is okay to follow all these girls and message them (which, by the way, is NOT OKAY), he as your boyfriend should be concerned that his behavior and actions are affecting you in a very negative way. A very important part of being an SO is to make your partner feel great about themselves and to reassure them. He is doing neither of these things.

It seems that he really isn't bothered how his actions are affecting you mentally. Do yourself a favor and find someone who appreciates you.

Let me be clear. **What he is doing is straight up selfish, sleazy, and cruel. His behavior is NOT normal.** I am a male in a relationship of similar length (almost 4 years) and I would never dream of doing this to my girlfriend, and I wouldn't stand for it if she did it to me, because it is beyond hurtful."

"So agreed. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for two and a half years.  Known his kids a little over a year. 

We don’t live together. So I don’t administer big punishments. But I certainly offer reasonable corrections like if they fight over a toy they have to give it up to me, or not running by the pool, etc. I don’t put them in time out or anything like that yet because I don’t live with them and he and I are not married. So it’s reasonable he is the real disciplinarian. 

Even so, my boyfriend backs me up 100% of the time. And if he disagreed with me we’d have a separate conversation about it away from the kids and he’d explain his position to me. And they’re his kids so I’d listen. But I know we would have a *discussion*. Because he respects me and my thoughts. Even if he doesn’t always agree. 

This is a sign of lack of respect OP. She doesn’t care what you think or how you feel. And that’s a real problem. She’s using you and then demanding you cater to her decisions. And that’s not ok.

Do you really want to be with a person who has no respect for you? Because your requests are reasonable (no devices at the table, the should attend school unless ill or an emergency situation). You’re not asking to be able to spank them when she opposes corporal punishment. That’s a hard line for many parents. Which is fair."
"Sorry about your grandad, and sorry your (ex) boyfriend has not been supportive when you need it. I'm glad that you have a lot of other excellent support though.

Petty me thinks you should text him, ""Our relationship is over"", and when he asks why, you should say ""sorry, didn't think you had time to go into it."" But realistically, you shouldn't do that. It sounds like he's not responsive, so I think a goodbye text and block is fine - you don't need the added stress of trying to call and him not picking up, and then wondering if you should leave a voicemail or wait until he can call back or whatever."
"&gt; My ex would lie and delete evidence to hide her drinking and infidelity so I almost certainly projecting trust issues about that situation onto my new girlfriend too.

Yeah, this is pretty obvious.  You're punishing her for your issues.  

And I'd imagine if everyone was as black and white with you as you are with them, we'd all be lonely as fuck."
"Did OP ask for all that though? Did OP's wife have someone in her family to support?

Also, is OP's brother not deserving of half the inheritance just because their dad was an asshole?"
"This  is the exact thing to do and say. You need to explain to your wife that it's not about giving your brother part of your inheritance/helping him out. It is about making right the scumbag thing your dad did, namely leaving your brother out of the inheritance for shitty reasons. "
I found it very telling that he says “we live in a house WE inherited” but also that this money is HIS inheritance. Really? Did WE inherit the house? Sounds like SHE inherited the house. These things are either joint or they’re not 
"She's not going to stop until she badgers you into submission. She is a bully and she is using her cancer to blackmail you. She literally thinks that this is a negotiation. Think about that. She thinks that *she* gets a say in when you have a child. That is not normal unless you're a huge narcissist.

You need /r/justnoMIL - this woman sounds *beyond* horrible and if you don't start getting hardcode now, this is going to get out of control and you are going to be miserable.

You and your husband are not doing this right. You can't draw boundaries properly unless there are consequences. You need to start enforcing consequences on her."
"I agree they're both being irresponsible. I'm just baffled by the comments lambasting the 24 year old guy for job hopping while giving the 23 year old girl who has never been employed a free pass. Is she absolved of all personal responsibility because she popped out a kid?

I'm also lol'ing at the people telling her to give him an ultimatum or leave. Who's gonna support her if she leaves? She has no job or work history."
"C'mon man, empathy. The original comment is right. Set boundaries and make it clear, she's recovering from a shitty situation and clearly has unhealthy ideas of what's good for her here.

Sometimes the hard line is necessary but this sub can go over the top with it on occasion."

"You. Are. Not. Over. Reacting. You are SEVERELY underreacting because you have no idea what normal relationships look like. Your previous boyfriend and your parents model
Abusive relationships. It's all you know. I don't mean this as a dig, it's so so sad to me that this happened to you. But step one is recognizing your normal meter is completely off here. 

Google ""love is respect"", or read the book ""why does he do that"". I can't link here but you will find it from googling. These are resources that will help you to see your relationship more clearly. 

It is totally normal for abusers to hide their worst qualities from other people and to start their abuse slowly over time. This is a horrible sign for the future. Many abusers are also super personable and their victims friends all love them. What matters is how they treat you. In this case, how he treats you is he hurts you for fun and WONT STOP. 

You aren't to blame here, but you need to open your eyes and leave him. "
"I would be hurt in your position too. Despite what the comments say saying, I feel like most would (or at least most ~college-aged people) would. 

That being said, I’d still recognize that they didn’t really do anything wrong.

Ultimately though, you only knew him for a week. I don’t know why he decided to tell you because it served no purpose, but if he’s truly great, this seems very forgivable. "
"I also agree with the wife because the brother made these choices. There are also a lot of questions that OP has to ask.

- Are you setting up an expectation that you can and will bail him out? You make enough salary and have a paid off home, so you could conceivably keep funneling money to him.
- Is he going to do a bunch of drugs with the money? Is he going to die or end up in rehab?
- Will giving him money help his depression at all? It won't make his career progression go any faster, and it reduces his student loans from ""impossibly high"" to ""barely possibly high"" if he's making very little money.
- Given that money isn't a panacea for depression, is it possible that he commits suicide and you've only just successfully made a student loan provider richer?

Honestly, I can understand your wife's POV. My SO has a brother who has collected more than your brother in student loans, insisted on living in a high CoL city, got a good job, and then proceeded to quit the job because it wasn't his passion... so he could live with his parents and contribute nothing. It would drive me crazy if my SO gave him tens of thousands of dollars of inheritance because his brother's lack of money is based on his own choices. On the other hand, I made choices to minimize debt, sacrifice fun to save for retirement, pursue a stable and well-paying and boring career, and make every other unfun and responsible choice because money and stability matter to me. 

Your brother made the decision to take out that much in student loans to pursue whatever career passion he had. He picked a career with a depressingly slow progression. He chose to establish himself in a high cost of living area. He made choices that debt and money and quality of life matter less to him than whatever his career path is and living in a trendy area.

This is all besides the fairness argument and how much your wife's family has given to you. What income would you be receiving if you had to get your own job?"

"Doing ding ding. Guaranteed there are 14-18 year olds there. Booze and drugs are a given as well.

This isn't camping with the boy scouts. This is an unsupervised race at the beach. 

Clearly there are different parenting styles and it is very important to be aligned with your partner. Some parents are Laisser faire, others are controlling. Neither is correct really, but its most important to be consistent. 

Every kid is also very different. Some kids are irresponsible and we'll get into a lot of trouble in the situation, others will make good decisions and not end up dead on the beach. I know from first-hand from my kids that my oldest is very susceptible to peer pressure, and my son has no self-control and would end up dead on the beach for sure."

BUT that does not mean you are wrong to have your own wishes to live alone and it's not what he is saying anyway, this seems to be more about convenience for him.

As for what to do, stand your ground and be crystal clear with him about what will happen and what will not happen. You can also initiate longer term conversations, especially ones about when you would see yourself moving in together.

Is he the one for you?"
So you don't trust your wife enough to be able to handle these things? To be able to turn down an offer for drinks? That's on YOU.

2:  you are assuming your wife had no control over her sex drive and will approach any man in her vicinity

3: you assume men have no control over their sex drive and actions

What this says....YOU have no control over your own sex drive and don't view women as ""people"", and project that onto everyone around you.  You also have little to no respect or trust in your wife."

Nah I’d assume summer internship. Most students wouldn’t consider school a “professional environment.” (Not that it makes it less predatory for a man a hair away from 30 to hit on a girl a hair away from high school.)
The dynamic isn’t the same. A firstborn is about survival. The parents can neglect everything else around the home without any major disasters because newborns aren’t able to move and get into much. They can’t do that with an older child running around.

"I agree with almost everything except his addiction- was he actually diagnosed or is this something he’s telling OP because he doesn’t want to be monogamous? Too many people self-diagnose “sex addiction” for what really is playing the field.

Also, and you didn’t say otherwise but I hope OP sees this, he didn’t use to be an alcoholic.  There is no “use to.”  Also, if he truly is one, he is still in the throes of his addiction if he is getting drunk 2-3 times a year.  And if he is one, I doubt the veracity of his claim of 2-3 times a year."

"Thanks to everyone for your great advice! 

I talked to Abby today and told her what was up. While she is a cool, fun Aunt, she was definitely not down for a relative stranger and 3 extra rambunctious kids tagging along with me and my crew.  

She agreed she wouldn’t send anymore pictures, etc. I explained that I thought she was beyond kind for trying to show Becky that the rabbit has a great home, I was afraid that Stacey was mistaking this kindness for an invitation for more contact.  

For those asking if I have told Stacey “no,” I have told her what I thought was no, saying things like “Abby isn’t set up for extra company,” and “ Abby works a lot and I don’t get to spend much time with her, it’s a ‘sisters’ weekend.  

The next time it is brought up, I’m just going to say “ Stacey, I’ve tried to be kind but I need to be blunt. No.” 

I’m also going to ask if there’s anything else we need to talk about. This really, really doesn’t seem like it’s about the rabbit. I’m not sure what else is going on, but I think she’s really projecting some other issue onto this one.

"Your feelings are valid.  However I would urge you to look at it this way: You didn’t really get her what she wanted.  You definitely tried, and your heart was in the right place, but she didn’t want the Fitbit, she wanted the Apple Watch.  Next time, it would be better to get her something totally different, or maybe an Apple gift card she could use toward what she wanted, instead of a substitute.

I know you wanted to make her happy, and you put a lot of thought and care into selecting the Fitbit.  But in the end, it really wasn’t what she wanted, so please don’t be upset at her for it.  It doesn’t mean she didn’t appreciate the gift, it just means she needed to get what she really wanted.  That’s ok, right ?"

"Ah man. Your girlfriend is in the midst of something I've definitely fallen into before. I'll give you my story in summary:

Me and this guy were super close friends. It had never been sexual, not even a little, we were both in relationships off and on and never single at the same time. We hung out alone, texted a lot, our friendship was based around intellectual stimulation, we would send huge chunks of text to each other talking about all kinds of stuff. Never anything inappropriate, but definitely giving him more time than I guess I should have looking back. In both his head and my head (for almost 4 years) we were just friends. We even joked about how annoying it was that people assumed we were anything more than that. Then, we were both single at the same time. That intellectual stimulation turned into something more. In my case, he turned out to be a royal asshole so it was short lived and now we don't speak, but I definitely fell into this without ever realizing that's where it was headed. And upon reflection, I do have to say I think in the back of his mind there was always a bit of ulterior motive (whether he actively realized this or not is a different story) and he was ready to pounce on an opportunity if it rose, which it did. I guess other people around me could see it but I couldn't, and I'm guessing that could very well be the case here. I think it's completely possible that your girlfriend has talked herself into thinking that it doesn't matter he ever liked her, that because she's not single and he has a GF that it can't possibly be inappropriate.

Have you tried phrasing it like this: ""how would you feel if I was constantly texting a girl that we both knew carried a torch for me?"" and go from there. I think remaining calm while you talk about it would make all the difference. The most you can do is try and work with her to see your perspective and go from there I think.

Edit: It has been pointed out that I come off pretty holier than thou in the above text. So I'd like to be clear - of course I played my own part in my situation. I was barely out of high school and my context of healthy/realistic relationships was completely different than it is now, I went from one long term toxic relationship into the next and then fell in with this guy who had a slew of extremely manipulative behaviors and severe mental health issues who I thought was a very healthy person in my life. I had behaviors myself that would certainly be seen as emotionally manipulative as well, which although I didn't see at the time I absolutely do now and have grown from those realizations about myself. I'm not attempting to excuse my actions by saying this about him, just that in my situation ""S"" turned out to be a real piece of work who had been playing the long game and I had been a severely naive young woman who wasn't realistic with her approach to what was going on. I hope this clarifies a bit, I'm not some perfect angel. "
"He's not sending mixed signals, he's clearly telling you he doesn't want a relationship but still wants to sleep with you.

"Thank you. I understand hes looking at it differently which is why I've been lenient on some of his aweful comments in the past. I offered the arrangement where I didn't mention her in return he wouldn't be insulting her. Cause at the end of the day this isn't about him. He didnt go through the good or the bad. I did. And I felt like he was making this all about his feelings when it was something that I had experienced. 


I dont want to force him to feel a certain way towards my mother 


What I'm not okay with though is my mother being dragged into completely unrelated topics and arguments even after he had promised he wouldn't. At this point its just being used to serve him and it has nothing to do with him worrying about me. 


If he cared at all about me he would have asked how I was going with everything. He would have focussed on my fear with the pregnancy scare. Instead he mocks my feelings and brings in my mother to point out that she's ruined me.


Maybe I'm reading into it but to me at this point it feels as though he does it to discredit me and my feelings. To point out that I was emotionally ruined etc. 


If that's how he feels then he should equally want to walk away im not his charity case "
"There is nothing* embarrassing about getting tested for STDs. It means you’re a responsible adult who is looking out for their health and the health of their sexual partners. 

As someone with herpes, yes it is embarrassing at first, but it just becomes a routine part of life. It does make me sad that you said this though. I consider myself more or less blameless in contracting it. The man who gave it to me was asymptomatic, and I also made him get a full STD panel (which come to find out does not include herpes) before I had sex with him. I wasn’t acting irresponsibly (I mean how many people make a new partner go to the doctor for testing before sleeping with them?!). And I don’t think I should have to live with shame because I contracted it. 

Maybe this experience will change your attitude towards people with herpes, since you could have contracted it but were fortunate not to. We don’t deserve to be embarrassed, we shouldn’t have to feel ashamed. And tbh, we are everywhere. 


*well, there shouldn’t be. It’s part of being a sexually active adult. "

"Once a month is bordering on dead bedroom territory, and I can understand why he's so unhappy with the current state of things. If intercourse is difficult for you at the moment, what other things can you do with him sexually? Cuddling and snuggling isn't a substitute."

it's easy to be brave on someone else's behalf!"

"Misogyny is pretty much the hatred of women. How is having expectations mean you hate women? Sometimes people use words that are powerful to shame someone into behaving a certain way. 

Look at the age difference, dude. She's still a kid. I would move on. There are plenty of women more your speed."
"You should make an extra effort to show the mother of your children that she is your priority, if she truly is and never stop doing that. "
"Chiming in here as an attorney who has worked at a firm (and will return there soon enough): this office manager's behavior would be unacceptable. Because partners (themselves attorneys) hold the power at our firm, non-attorney office managers behaving like this would not be permitted to fire a good receptionist and would face some consequences over treating delivery people shitty like this (including possibly termination if they're not able to stop being shitty).

For the times we can't file on the docket electronically, we *want* our couriers/delivery people to be super fucking happy with us to make sure our stuff gets in on time. Don't treat the delivery people like shit. Also, don't treat anyone in the building (including those visiting it) like shit. It's bad for the firm, and part of what I have enjoyed working there is that everyone gets treated with the utmost respect and kindness."
"Ask him if he's willing to try pegging. If he actually is, say, ""That's great. We can incorporate that, but the answer for me is still no. Don't bring it up again."" My guess is he's not, so he doesn't get to whine and complain about not getting it if he won't take it himself.

But I would not continue to date someone who pestered and begged me daily for anal. ""Clearly your needs aren't getting fulfilled, and I'm sick of your shit anyway, so there's the door."""
"Funny thing: I guarantee that the hotel guy had access to a can of Coke someplace.  The kitchen stocks such things, along with bottled water and small packets of chips, for events, and the bartenders have them for making mixed drinks in the ballroom as well.  If the guy had been a bit more polite, I'll betcha a million dollars the desk agent would have told him to hang on and run off, found one, and just given it to him."
Yeah...robbing someone of sleep deliberately is actually often considered physical abuse as well as psychological.  I'm so sorry you endured that

"When I was 12, my mom had another baby (I already had a younger brother who was 8 at the time) and I think I reacted very similarly to your daughter. 

I was completely gutted by the news that I would have a new sibling, because I was used to the way things were. The idea of things being upheaved so dramatically really bothered me, especially when I was already careening into an increasingly hormonal state of being. I’m sure some of it was that I knew I would get considerably less attention - especially when I think I needed attention as a teenager that would help inform how I should grow up, or what kind of person I should grow up into. My sister was planned, so part of my trouble was that I felt like I should have had some say - and even in retrospect (she’s 15 now, and my sister still sometimes calls me “second mommy”) I think that I was put into a position of having a lot of responsibilities that someone else signed me up for, and felt that it was unfair.

Teenagers are quite naturally self-centred, so it would probably help to some extent if you do give her some of the attention she is obviously trying to get by acting out - talk to her. Ask her questions about how she feels about the whole thing - really let her explain her perspective and feelings on the matter and try to consider the way she sees the situation, even if she can’t really do anything about it or have things her way. Ultimately I had to accept my parents decision, but I appreciate that my mom did talk to me about what was bothering me about it and what my specific concerns were - even though I hadn’t been originally consulted in the decision, it helped me to feel like I was a part of the family, and my opinions did matter. 

One of the solutions/compromises that my mom came up with me to help me feel important and involved in the family was to let me name my sister. Honestly that also probably helped with the responsibilities I had to take on towards her later as well, because I already had that connection with her. I realise of course that letting someone that age name a baby might be… a gamble, so really actually they had me make a list of ten names, and they choose what they liked best from that (which was the name I wanted anyway!) But things like that might help - even just incorporating her in the process of deciding a name, or in other decisions that might be made can help her adjust to the change."
It’s wrong. Similar to people who leave their pets alone all day in a cage. Children need room go play and a space for themselves. I could not imagine not being able to go to a different room if I needed a break from my child. 
"You obviously need closure. You should get it whether it's good or not.  Besides what do you have to lose?

At worst you get told off by your sister ( or your mom) and  ""lose"" a relationship that has already ended

OR 

You possibly reconnect again and become a family once more."
"This demand, this early, is a serious fucking red flag. 

It's made all the worst by the ""I never want to meet him"" position. That is just some serious childish bullshit from this supposed adult man.

You're friends with a guy you dated for weeks, over a year ago. You don't need to deliver this friend a formal notice that your body is no longer 'available' to them. It hasn't been 'available' for ages.

Ditch this guy you've been seeing for a few weeks. He is not ""fine"" with you being friends with this ex. Everything about his position here is telling you he how he views the world. There are going to plenty of other things that he says he's ""fine"" with that he turns around and tries to bully and punish you over. "
"Yeah. So there's a thing called ""compromise.""

My mom LOVES visiting old historical home and do tours, my dad not so much, but guess what? He goes to support her interests.

She supports his interests by going out on the boat to relax while he fishes or goes to his collection club (60's vintage GIJoe stuff) with him once and a while.


Have you stood up for yourself and told him that you would really appreciate if he'd go along with you once to something you're interested in.
""Boyfriend, I feel rejected when I want to share an activity with you when you brush it off or make an excuse not to go. I'd really appreciate if you'd do something with me that I'm interested in.""

He'll probably say, ""What do you want to do?""

In which case, you tell him what you like to do.

If he huffs and puffs or gets defensive, then maybe consider that this relationship isn't going to work out. 
We don't need to enjoy each other's hobbies and activities, but we do need to participate once and a while out of consideration.


I always find it best to find an activity that I enjoy, but also has elements of what my partner might enjoy. I like going to the secondhand store. He doesn't, but he always finds something cool while we're there so he doesn't mind going every time. "

While I get where you are coming from, I think what they asked for was pretty normal for someone her age. I would understand you saying no to someone that's 18-19, but you're barely older than her. 

She's allowed to be upset. You are allowed to say no. I do think the consequences you are worried about are almost non-existent, so it seems a little weak, but that's your prerogative. "
I feel like so many people just aren't reading the whole thing lmao. He said normally he would do it but he wants a clean record because he wants to become a cop. He just doesn't want to risk it. You can't say absolutely nothing would happen because it could. You never know. It's also shitty to just demand a friend do you a favor or you're not going to talk to them.

"He made her think that her long term boyfriend was cheating on her.

All the while he is FILMING her with the intent to show other people later, thus intending to humiliate her in the process. Yes, hurting your girlfriend and humiliating her publically...so funny!

If she broke up with him right now and walked away, it would be well deserved. This is a massive fuck up on his part. "
"They're the ones being immature, thinking that their way is right and yours is wrong. Your only approach is to secure independent access to things like money, phone, car, etc. such that they can't take them away from you. Things may suck right now but they are in your power to take control of, eventually. This paid internship sounds like step one - get some money he can't track, get a phone he can't track. Car might be a big expense but public transport hopefully works. Likewise moving out - you may need a better job and / or to save up, but it's absolutely doable. You can get yourself free from them.

I'd also say to an extent it doesn't matter whether they've got the best of intentions or are awful people. You're your own person - you get to make your own decisions about your own life, even if they end up being the wrong ones. Your parents can either support you or not, agree or not, respect them or not. But whatever their opinions, they have to accept your decisions, because they literally have no other choice. They can't lock you in the basement (and if they do, call the cops). And if they kick you out or cut you off, they clearly value having control over you more than they value having a good relationship with you. "
"&gt; no he didn’t. he offered to help. I didn’t realize he meant help at the time but you have to pay me back later

Help doesn't require the promise to pay it back.  Legally speaking, that is a loan.  If your dad didn't say ""I'll loan you the money"", you owe him nothing.  And you certainly do not owe your father for money for raising you.  That's ludicrous.  We seem to hear that a lot lately.  

Please do not pay him a red cent, much less $5/month.  That is validating the debt that your father claims you owe him.  If he feels you owe him money, let him take you to Court and prove you owe him money.  I guarantee he won't go that route, because there is no way he can prove you owe him a dime.  If you never promised to pay back any money, you owe him nothing.  I realize at one point you made a ""deal"" for some payback, and normally, I'd say to honor that deal.  That said, your father canceled that debt, therefore you owe him nothing.

Move out debt free and be happy.    "

Your ex has the maturity of a 12 year old at best and is an antagonistic monster at worst. What kind of person would do something to cause the other pain? To make them cry? How does anyone begin to find that funny?

For me this is a dumpable offense. For yourself, ask yourself how you’d advise your bestie or little sister in this situation. Or your daughter if you had one.

I think it’s fair that you assume the bills related to the apartment. As for the rent, it sounds like it was prepaid on the assumption you were going to be living together in the apartment for that duration. I don’t think it’s crazy that you’d pay the rent going forward. I don’t think he has a legal right to demand you pay him back. 

The fact of the matter is you broke up and still want the apartment. Honestly it sounds like you can’t really afford it and hope he’ll still help pay for it. "
"&gt; ""Reprimand"" is a word that carries a very specific connotation in a professional context. If your husband is in finance he must certainly be aware of that.

Definitely. And same with “complicated” vs “hard” - complicates means consisting of many interconnecting elements or parts, while hard means requiring a great deal of endurance or effort. Things can be complicated but not hard, hard but not complicated, or both complicated and hard. 

Something is wrong with OP’s husband. "
"As another commenter said, the “we’re not in love or having sex with each other or she’s like a sister to me,” arguments are red herrings. Frankly, I would not want my SO to be that close to his hypothetical sister either. That might be weirder to talk about our sex life.



He is withholding emotional intimacy from you out of some misguided sense of loyalty to his long gone sister that has now evolved into an unhealthy attachment. His brain seems wired to seek comfort in her since she was his comfort after losing his sister. Sorry to be blunt, but he needs to move on. Girlfriend needs to move on. They are emotionally codependent and it’s not healthy. 


So I don’t think you should call it an affair. It is and it isn’t. It’s a pretty far deviation from what we think of as far as affairs go, you will get stuck on defining what it is they are or aren’t doing. Instead, just directly tell him what bothers you and the bothersome manner in which you very fairly were exposed to those texts. Your husband seems oblivious and like he never dealt with his grief well enough. How did it get this far? Has this other girl had many serious relationships? Was your husband ever a problem for the boyfriend? 


They need to untangle a bit, and he needs to rewire his thinking. When anything funny, interesting, or worth saying crosses my mind, I text my SO and he texts me. It makes me feel special and intimate with him. OP, I’m not sure who your husband would text first, and that is a problem."
"She's definitely being unreasonable! All unmarried couples I know who live/lived together split expenses pretty evenly. And it's not like your mortgage is paid off or something- wtf.

"Yep. 100%. Especially if the OP expects (or gets offered) full or part financing from her mother. 

u/krongus , I don't know you, and I don't know if you want to ever get married in the future, or if you don't at the moment but you might change your mind. Whatever your stance is on marriage: if you think you might (ie a 0.001% chance you might) want to have a wedding in the future, then you need to start saving up, and you need to start practicing your reasons for refusing your mother's offers of paying for it. In some cultures, the bride's parent/s pay for the wedding. I would strongly advise you to make preparations now, even though you're still quite young. "
"Every woman is different. A female orgasm can be like cracking a safe. This is made nearly impossible when the woman doesn't know the code to her own safe in the first place. I've dated women who can't orgasm during PIV, ones who only orgasm during PIV, ones who only orgasm from masturbation and ones who only orgasm from a specific position under specific conditions. Stop letting this bruise your ego. This is nothing to be shamed or embarrassed about. I know you're just ""trying your best"", but hours of desperate oral and frantic fingering isn't the way to go here. More than likely, she very much enjoys having sex with you. Stop casting a shadow over everything just because you're not ""winning"" the race every single time. "

My response was ""good, hopefully it's annoying enough that you never do it again."" This friend actually thanked me years later for saying that and kind of adjusting her perspective on it a little.

"I’m gonna second the “speaking with a child” part, because reading OP’s responses was like me reading my 10 year old sisters responses to certain things. Either op is fibbing about her age, or is mentally/emotionally only capable of what a 10 year old is capable of (man, that sounds kinda harsh writing it out like that). I think OP would benefit with speaking to a proper medical professional who can better address her specific needs. Again, this sounds so harsh. God dang. "
"&gt; I personally think the photos thing is crossing the line. It's fine to send pictures IF HE ASKS FOR PICTURES but there is an over familiarity there that irks me. 

Sweet Jesus. My daughters preschool sends pictures of her day to me without my asking. Guess I’m having an inappropriate relationship with every teacher who has ever taken a picture of her. 

&gt; Why does your parenting relationship have to be any more than civil? 

Because a good coparenting relationship is good for the kid. And what the kid needs is more important than what you want. 

&gt; My relationship is crippled by a lack of boundaries and some pathological need to be close and friendly and chatty. 

No, your relationship is crippled because you’re threatened by a friendly chatty coparenting relationship and your partner can’t lay down the law with either you or his baby mama. Instead of a having parents who can chat and be friendly you think the poor kid ought to have her coaches and peers watch her parents act like five year olds who have to stay on opposite sides of the pool because “he’s looooooking at me! She’s tooooouching me! He’s breathing my air!” You’re probably one of those who would expect the kid to go to great lengths to accommodate your feelings during their milestone events too, aren’t you? That’ll make weddings and graduations fun for any future adult stepchildren. 

This insane girlfriend has been actively trying to engage in parental alienation. She’s been sabotaging their coparenting relationship because she thinks her feelings are more important than that child’s wellbeing. She’s gotten rough with the child before and the cops had to be called! And you’re on here telling op that being friendly is a bad thing so instead she needs to publicly embarrass her child in order to coddle crazy violent girlfriend’s feelings. The girlfriend shouldn’t be anywhere near the daughter much less at her swim lessons. 

Do the poor kid a solid and break up with your boyfriend if you can’t handle his/her parents being friendly. Nobody wants to be that person with the parents and stepparents who make every event they attend shitty and awkward."
"Wow a common sense reply, who knew such a thing was possible? Most of the others here have sharpened the pitchforks and are cranking up the fires."

"Baby Got Back was my karyoke song for many years, so I get the joke. If the friend knew the mom's name was Becky and still thought this was funny, then yeah, that friend is an asshole. But I have a hard time believing that. I think this is a simple case of a ho-hum joke gone wrong.

The thing I'm sort of perplexed about is why isn't anyone asking how the Dad is feeling or how he reacted? It was *his* wife that died. If he was chill about it, then I think everyone should relax and move on. Same with you OP, it was *your* mom. You seem more stressed/upset about the fiasco rather than having your feelings hurt over the shirt. If the dad and OP are okay, then Dallas and everyone else should let it go.

Oh and when people say they don't want a party, don't throw a surprise party."

I agree, spending money is likely to just stress him out. We do spend a lot of our free time hanging out together, since we have the same interests (video games, music, comedy), but he definitely tries to always do whatever I want to do, so I think it would be nice to give him a day that's just for him, so we can do whatever he wants together.

"I wonder if this is less about the waitresses' name and more about your long time friend Aubree encouraging you to date someone else. Which I don't think is something you did wrong (I assume this was during the time period when you and Sabrina were still not dating) but could be the root of the insecurity here. To be clear I still think your wife needs to grow up about it, but maybe getting at that will help."
"&gt; when I moved with him from abroad for his work he had a choice between an NYC and a smaller city, and he chose the former because it would've been easier for me to find a job/friends/etc.

Why wasn't this a joint decision to begin with? It's your home too. Him choosing NYC ""for you"" isn't nice, it isn't considerate, it's the bare fucking minimum of partnership. If that is seriously the best thing you can come up with that he's ever done for you, then you need to divorce now.

My husband kisses me every day. He makes me feel loved. He loves spending time with me and I love spending time with him. He makes sure I finish during sex. He does a hundred tiny things that make me feel loved--cooking dinner, washing the towels, making sure to prioritize what I want if I've had a bad day--and I do all those things for him, too, because I love him. He's my best friend.

You deserve that. You deserve so, so much more. This has nothing to do with him finding you sexy; he just doesn't *care* about you. I've also struggled with ED in my life and I know the idea that ""if I were just thinner then everything would be better."" That's not the problem. You're not the problem. He is. 

I'm so sorry. Stay strong. Protect yourself and start planning to leave."

the best friend tried to get him to cheat on his gf lol the best friend tried to kiss him. i don’t think he needs to ask his best friend for permission to talk to his own gf. its his relationship that the best friend tried to interfere with. so too bad for the best friend. 
"It kind of sounds like you’re his second choice, honestly. "
Yep. After the hook-up with her and the request to keep being friends with her I really think he likes her. I'd say it's better to cut your losses and let it go OP. You're his second choice and I don't think it's worth it to cry everytime he decides to visit her. If your bf really loved you he wouldn't have asked to keep being friends with her and to keep visiting her alone. He gave in because he saw you cry but I doubt he's going to be ok with not seeing her forever.

"Even though it's really stressful to pick a date that works for all the important people and also works with a venue, it's sucky that your sister didn't ask you what dates work for you.  
   
We had a group of people who we wanted to make sure would be there (bride and groom's parents, bride's grandma, and bride's siblings), so we made sure we picked a date and a venue that worked for all 9 of us. Beyond that, it was logistically impossible to make other accommodations. Planning around an aunt's birthday, let alone any of our 200 other guests special dates, would not have even crossed my mind."
All of this. This is a super sweet idea. 
"Well, if he can't use his words to tell you want he wants, then dumping him is the best path."
"My main concern would be getting her to us. We're located in NY, but my mom is all the way out in WY, so I'd be worried about her traveling all that distance. Air travel would be her best bet, but my mom's cancer is in her lungs, and she gets very easily winded and relies on oxygen. I'd be really worried about the pressure and oxygen levels in the cabin. As well, I'm just a little worried about moving her because of how easily disoriented and confused she can be these days. I definitely worry about how she'd fare in the city, as opposed to the rural lifestyle she's always lived. Even taking her in a car would concern me, how would she doing rest stops? Would it make her scared?

As well, I don't want my mom in assisted living. I do plan on hiring a nurse to supplement her care, but I would not want my mom to go into any sort of care home. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing she was dying surrounded by strange people in a strange place, I just wouldn't feel good about it. My mom has always been a woman that put family and community first, and I want her to die surrounded by the people she loves.

Her doctor says that at most, she has six months, but that's pushing it. It's more likely she's down to two or three at this point. And I want to be there for those months."

"Honestly we can’t fully grasp your relationship with your brother in this small snippet of your life, but it seems like your heart is set on being at that festival. I would just ask you to consider that 5 or 10 years from now, which one will you regret not being at more? Which one will have more negative impacts upon your life? 

Personally, I would go to the wedding. You did the work for the festival, it can go on your resume and you built the contacts you needed to leave uni with a bang. You even said that you don’t have much to do that day and you can find a filler. 

A family wedding of one of your own siblings is a rare occasion in ones life, and something very meaningful that can have huge impacts on your relationships with said family for the future. It will make a huge impact if you don’t go. 

Good luck. "
"Nope. I'm a lesbian too, and you don't want to be friends with her. 

""Not cutting out anyone who disagrees with you"" is about being friends with people who root for different sports teams or feel differently about pineapple on pizza. Not maintaining relationships with people who disagree with your existence fundamentally and ""support a lot of things that disgust you.""

If you stay friends with her, there's a good chance she'll stab you in the back at some point- I was friends with a girl who was only *slightly* homophobic when I was around fifteen, and she eventually ended up trying to get me suspended from school. After you're not friends with this girl anymore, or maybe even now, you're going to remember a million little things she did that added up to take a big toll on your mental health.

Plus, other people, potential friends you have more in common with are going to assume you're a bigot because you hang out with her. And that's not the kind of impression you want to be giving people. Members of your own community who've met her would assume that you're not worth talking to. And that's tragic. "
"If you bought tickets using his miles then it was heavily discounted no? You’re essentially just paying for the surcharge and fees but not the whole cost of the ticket. 

I don’t think you should ask to split the cost since you are already benefiting from his miles that he could’ve saved to use on a trip for himself. You’re not reimbursing him for the full cost (because you only got the discount by using his saved miles) so it’s not like you’re walking out of here with 0 benefit.

So if he has a program that allows him to get a free ticket, that free ticket is really just his. He’d be kind to split the cost with you but it’s not an obligation nor is it really fair imo."
"I think you made this such a bigger deal than it needed to be. You even told your parents? Goodness, hon, you might have scared this guy off for good."
"Not really. Wills are often contested, and there's no guarantee OP would win. Even if they did, it might mean months or years in court, and hefty legal fees. Adoption makes it much easier.

Also, without adoption, they wouldn't be considered family where medical decisions are concerned. Op could be kept from visiting them in the hospital. Worse, if OP ends up in hospital, biomom could keep his/her chosen family out. "
OP this is emotional and sexual abuse - you really shouldn't be treated this way!

You don't deal with her. She's not your kid and she has every right to be angry. You shouldn't be involved at all at this point.

TONS of military dudes are abusers.
"First and foremost - I need to know if he is cheating or not.

All I know is he signed onto a dating profile. 

I do not know if it was because he was intending to cheat, or if it was something else such as attempts to delete the account or a hacking situation- as other posters in this thread have shared similar experiences. I've been investigating further and it is clear that the pics on the account predate our relationship, so I believe it is an older account, not something he made recently.

I am not going to implode my relationship without evidence. 

If he was creeping, then I will ask him to start looking for a new place. "
"I agree with you on the job front, but she doesn't owe these assclowns a fucking dime. They were scamming her. "
"&gt; Now, my bf and her both NEED fans to sleep.

Don't you dare sully the name of us proud fan people. "
"Listen. I'll be blunt. He's a loser and he's ruining your life. And STILL acts as if he's entitled to more (having Missie live there too). He's dragging you down. He's exploiting you. You are being taken advantage of. BECAUSE THATS WHAT ADDICTS DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  He may be clean, but his mentality has not changed one iota.

Out he goes. "
"When you feel satisfied with your answers here I would recommend for you:

 1 - apologize to your spouse for not being on his team in this

 2 - go on a date night and make things right between you, I'm sure this has all been very stressful on your marriage

 3 - rehash or reaffirm together your timeline and conditions for Missy (if any)

 4 - hash out a timeline for your brother to move out and be on his own two feet again

I think that this will help you to remember there's a larger picture here. Don't forget about your spouse, they've been in this situation too for a while and you love them. &lt; 3"
"She would have to be really jacked to not be overweight at that height and weight though. I’m a dude her height with high intermediate lifter numbers and she weighs 15 pounds more than me.   Realistically it’s extremely unlikely she has anywhere near my muscle mass as well. 

Not a dig at her or anything, but she absolutely could lose some weight. She’s 5 pounds heavier than a male who’s almost half a foot taller. She’s a full point of BMI into overweight on a scale that trends higher for males and lower for women because of natural genetic differences in genders. 

Her boyfriend isn’t just one of those tall skinny guys. He’s a tall guy who’s skinny because he works out and controls his eating. "
If your gut is telling you it’s probably not a good idea. LISTEN. Doesn’t seem safe regardless of how much you think you know of this person (it’s a stranger on the internet). 
"Yeah, so if her dad's paying for her phone, the consequences for mistreating him and his household could be, among other things, him cutting off the money to her phone account. She would have to start paying for it herself. That's an adult consequence forcing her to take responsibility. That's the only sort of thing that works at this point. "
"But in fairness, if this is something that could put her at risk, she should be warned about what it was. "
"&gt; they are also violating the privacy of everyone you communicate with

This. They may justify checking the phone because ""shes my daughter"", but that doesn't stand up on the other side."
She obviously posted those pictures for you to see and the fact that your bf knew you would see those photos shows he did not necessarily care what your perception of their “friendship “ is. Then again perception is reality..... 
"You don't ""bring it up"" other than to dump him. There is no discussing this. He shared your nude photos with other people. That is disgusting and unacceptable. He doesn't respect you or your privacy. "
"If you didn't take her on vacation or pay her rent for her, you'd still expect, I hope, that she'd be kind to you and clean up after herself. So throwing it in her face is just a spiteful power play. It has nothing to do with the real issue. "
"If your girl friends exploit their boyfriends the same way your boyfriend exploits you, they're not good people either. It's not about gender, it's about appreciating each other and making each other feel valuable (not necessarily through money gifts, but they're one of the meters). "
"Exaclty! You know I completely reject her assumptions that he's lazy and that his is all luck. This dude has been in the army for many years which is one of the most difficult and gruelling jobs ever. Has op ever considered that maybe he got this job and the promotion because he's smart, talented and hardworking?

As a chill, laid back person myself there are certain people that assume because you're smiling and happy and because you don't stress and get burnt out that you're not working hard or that you don't take things seriously. It seems like op doesn't think hubby deserves success and doesn't think work is valid unless he's made himself miserable and grumpy like she is."
"He's the perfect combination of thoughtless/stingy AND demanding/greedy. Not really a gem, here.

The kicker is being ungrateful and rude after you gave him very nice gifts. 

I know you don't want/expect expensive presents yourself, but he has behaved like a spoiled child. 

Do you want to end up with someone like this and have him set that sort of example for your kids, if you had them?"
"&gt;  He told me I was free to go through his phone at any time and it’d only  be fair that he gets to go through mine, if he didn’t give me his phone  then that alone is something I could use to break up with him over. 

You....do realize that you don't need his permission, or what he considers a ""valid"" reason, to break up with him?"
[removed]
This was an intentional move on his part.He is telling you that he won’t be pressured by you to do anything he doesn’t want to.He is selfish and borderline abusive.When someone shows you who they really are you should believe them the first time.This isn’t the first time........
"I agree completely. I do all of the cooking/grocery shopping/meal planning, because I love cooking and have much higher standards in terms of quality and variety than he does. He also has incredibly pale, sensitive skin that burns easily and even just reaching into the oven to pull out a pan with potholders will set it off. (He's not lying, I've seen it - it's seriously weird.) Also we cannot grocery shop together because I drive him nuts calculating the unit price of every single item, reading the labels, carefully inspecting the fruit and thumping the melons, etc. and occasionally going to multiple stores for specific sales. 

In return, he carries in the groceries, does all of the dishes, and lots of other cleaning (laundry, vacuuming, etc). He actually ends up doing more than me and it works out so much better for both of us than if we tried to alternate cooking days out of some arbitrary requirement."
You lost me at taking polls of co-workers.... jeez
"So let me understand this...you think you're entitled to call all the men at your work as 'off limits' for other people while you 'get to know them better' as potential interests, yet somehow she was supposed to know this particular one out of all the other ones you declared as off limits the the ONLY ONE you've been interested in years?

Do you hear yourself? She has respected your 'off limits' juvenile thing and she's right, you did nothing with any of them. So all women are supposed to back off until you get first dibs on all men just because you called it. Now who is treating people as things to stake claim on? 

He was interested in her and asked her out. Based on all the other 'off limits' guys, how many asked you out that you dated? So why is everyone expected to be celibate to let you go first? I don't know what 'friends' took your side on this but I got to think they also think it is ok to just piss on some guy and claim him."

"well, putting on weight with pregnancy IS normal in the rest of the world? so...yeah. Most people do lose it after pregnancy, but bodies do change, and change permanently with pregnancy - like stretch marks, the shape of one's abdomen may change, etc. And there's a pretty vast range of ""normal"" - some people are naturally chubbier, and don't overeat - they are just fleshier, whereas some people are naturally skinnier. you're correct that the US is fatter than it should be, there's no doubt about it, but there are some societal reasons for that (look into hours of leisure for the average american vs. the rest of the world, corn subsidies, no health care, poor education - honestly the US is kind of fucked in a lot of ways, and there are a lot of ways that the government could intervene to make us all healthier, other than just shaming). 

But anyway, what's your question? are you just venting or do you need advice about some aspect of this?"
You are assuming that abuse victims are thinking logically.
He refuses to call or text her and won't have sex with her.  He was a shit bf and is selfish af.
I would have lost it on her the first time. I love animals but you know I treat them like animals. I personally think it  is animals abuse to treat a dog like a baby. I also think many vegan animal lovers have all these delusions about animals but really know nothing about nature. I much prefer conservationist. 
"Not taking the time to properly train her dogs IS a form of animal abuse. ESPECIALLY abused rescues need to have structure and rules to help them cope. A trained dog is a happy dog.

You mentioned that one  of  her dogs attacked your FIL's labrador...One of these days, one of her untrained asshole dogs is going to bite the wrong animal/person and have to be put down because she refused to do the difficult work of teaching her dogs how to cope."
"She saw concrete, explicit evidence of the ""old you"". She might as well have been there. She's questioning now if you really are changed or just putting on a show. Plus, she sounds pretty sexually conservative, so she might just feel disposablr and like another notch on your belt."
"Sometimes you just want an orgasm, not sex. Yes, you are wrong in feeling the way you feel. "
"You say “new you” like you just woke up one day in a new body with a new personality. That’s not how it works. You are the sum of your life experiences. You may not behave exactly the same now, but those parts of your past still played a large part in shaping who you are now. And she may not like the fact that you have those pieces of the past influencing your life. "
"Okay, maybe I’ve changed my mind and DO think it’s the sunk cost fallacy. 

You’re 25, not some old maid. "
"Yeah, I agree. Just because alcohol is the most popular &amp; most socially acceptable ""mind-altering"" drug doesn't mean that drinking brings out your true nature or whatever.

No one would say ""weed you is the real you"" or ""cocaine you is the real you"" sooo..."

"This is all second or third-hand account of manipulative behavior and still doesn't imply abuse only that the guy APPEARS to be having a problem making his own choices. 

You could argue that there's emotional abuse taking place, but again it would be third-hand accounting and every relationship has two sides. We have no idea who's actually making it worse. I don't think this should be an issue about who to ""blame"" for OP's problem, rather talk about what's the best way to make sure the friend his getting help if he needs it. Which is exactly what the top scoring comments in this post have said."
Completely agree with this.  I also think he is mainly responsible here. She is being controlling and he is being a doormat and an asshole to his friends. Invite somebody else in his place if that is an option. 
"Oh my lord, this woman has no boundaries, wow. You are not the problem, she is. Stand your ground, even if you feel guilty and it's hard. Easier said than done of course."

"I actually don't support him. He has his own place and pays for his own stuff, and same for me. That's a firm boundary for me, since I don't like having dependents."

For balayage it’s 170-250. I usually have to pay extra on top for a haircut. Regular nail polish are 20-30 while gel can be 30-50 not including tips.
"I mean this with respect, but has it ever occurred to you that ""her control"" isn't really a phrase people use to describe marriages that are healthy?"
"Please don't have kids with this guy. He's shown you who he is going to be as a parent, by pointing out his example friends, and saying his mom would just come live with you.

He will not change a diaper. He will not give a bath. He will not take the baby so you can have a shower. "
"This is heartbreaking.  Taw, what you've described above is an abusive relationship.  Your wife is abusing you.  I'm going to PM you a link to The Hotline - specifically the page called 'is this abuse?'  At least a third of those behaviours match what your wife is doing.  

This relationship isn't healthy and it isn't safe.  You deserve to be treated with love and respect, not act as a whipping boy for your wife to take out her frustrations.  If it matters, I'm a housewife close to her age with depression too- but there is no excuse for abuse.  None.

Please, please check out the link I send you, and the whole 'the hotline' site as well.  Please take care of yourself."
"Honestly, it doesn't sound like you believed a single inch of what she said. I reckon you just wanted to figure out why someone who is not attached to either of you in any way would target you. Did you want to gain an understanding of why she would say those things or was it more that you were skeptical about your husband?"
"Yeah, this is what you get for dating an 18 year old. Your call, dude. "
"Haha, yeah.  The sacrifices he’s made are just par for the course, not bonus points.  How dare she bring up things like a bigger car or air conditioning that could make both of their lives better, how *dare* she think of ideas to improve things.  I’m just imagining the conversations.  

Her:  “Hey, I have an idea, let’s get air conditioning.  I know that we can have it installed for xyz amount, should I look into contractors? It would make putting the baby down much easier, and we’d get a lot more sleep!”

Him: “I gave up a plane for you, how dare you ask me for anything more.”

Lololol.  He’s angrily rejecting her reasonable suggestions on things they could do together to make life with a kid easier, and that will definitely not help her to feel the love and respect that one needs to feel in order to be intament."
The saving face scenario would do the trick I think. He's all about appearance and such.
"3 nights alone in a row is lots of work. Heck I don't like doing it for my own children. Maybe have a babysitter come in for one night so she can get a break. My opinion but you might want to reacces the bedtime. 745 is on the early side for a 10 year old and 8 year old.

How is the house work split? Can you prepare dinner before you leave and clean up. Even if it is just sandwiches. Make sure their chores are done, homework done, and give your GF a real break before you leave? Even q hour for her to shower and relax before you leave. The trick is the household tasks still have to be done during this time."
"Holy crap...yeah.  The guy is a sadistic and violent rapist.

OP...please please please call a domestic abuse shelter and get out safely before he kills you."
She sounds like an immature baby. Tools are a classic housewarming present. Spoiled babies who blame others for everything usually stay that way for life. 
"Not your circus, not your monkeys. Your choices do not have to be dictated by Rob's sister. You stepped up to help them with *medical care*. This covers infusions and wound care. Since you're a really nice relative, you decided to save them on Insta Cart services as well. This does not suddenly make you a free-for-all servant that has no personal choice. Rob is an adult and you make no mention of his fingers being amputated or rendered useless. The man can download Rover or Wag! and use it. 

Honestly? You are doing *everybody* a favor by refusing to walk their dog. People who are uncomfortable around dogs should not be on the other end of the leash. Your discomfort and mild fear can make them more likely to show aggression and fear; that's a recipe for a bad situation. Especially since it's likely that you've never handled a large dog before. So, feel very comfortable telling Rob that you know it's safer for everyone, especially small children who may forget to ask before petting, if someone else walks the dog."
"Bedtime at 745 for a 10 year old?  That is really early.  Maybe you can flex on that, unless he's getting up at 5am..."
I agree..bored and parking and my partner doesn't always take my advice..I wish i had a relationship where those were the big issues...
"Wow. First off, it's just bad form to get upset over a gift that shows either thoughtfulness or expense. Your gift was both. She's being unreasonable.

And to hide in her room while you unloaded her belongings? I am amazed at her entitlement.

Honestly? If she wants to apologise, listen, maybe she's growing up. But otherwise, this is not the sort of trouble you should go chasing after.

Finally, awesome gift idea."
"Shit, if my bf was willing to support me in that way. I'd be at the gym yesterday."
He's a cheater and a liar. Tell him that now that you've broken up with him he can have all the privacy he wants. 
Stop talking to her. Crushes only last when you feed them. From now on you only see and speak to her with your gf present. Invest in other friendships and stay active. 
"Call me cynical but I'd be somewhat wary of a girl who dropped you like garbage as soon as a better guy was available, and who is divorced by age 23 (although here it could well be she just got unlucky, but still). Besides, she could have changed significantly over those 8 years, so be prepared for that possibility. "
"&gt; She will give me the silent treatment, turn off the Xbox, or throw a tantrum about something meaningless when I know it’s because I was playing video games. 

Dude, why the hell are you dating a toddler? Stop dating toddlers. It's not a good look."

"Interesting how stay at home moms get all this pity on this sub even when they are full blown abusers. Having a kids and being unemployed is a choice.she is an adult, there are no excuses for what she is, and I hope she ends up alone with herself. "
"No. He wasn’t introduced until after. She opened up to me about it and told me she wanted to meet him, which again, I was very hesitant about because letting some new paternal figure into my life is very uncomfortable to me. I agreed, struggled through a dinner together, then went home and completely broke down. "
"I'm really into deep wine red lipstick these days. What does that say -- Aging nicely? Sad, old drunk? "
Then I’d talk to your mom about that. He’s not your parent. 
He's saying that neither one of you is so attractive that someone would want to jump through hoops to break up or steal one of you. That seems reasonable. 
"Be super careful outside of work now. Make sure to always have your home secure and observe to make sure no one is following you after work. 

And I agree with others that you NEED to also tell this to the higher ups. Just a heads up, even, summarizing the sequence of events. "
"If you are dead set on not living together before engagement/marriage, and he is dead set on not formally committing to you without living with you (aka really finding out the ""real"" you/relationship), then yeah, you might have a problem.  Neither one of you are exactly wrong, but you want different things.  There are just SO MANY things you learn by living with someone.  Marriage is a big commitment and most people want all the information possible before making it."
"I'm not sure what else you could have done?  I'd have gone to my husband as well. It wouldn't be for him to prove anything, just to say ""Hey, so, this ex of yours is saying this stuff, I thought you should know."" and go from there.

Block the ex, and explain to your husband that you didn't doubt him, you were just blind sided by this person reaching out to you out of nowhere."
"Because they might not be lies. I'm not telling OP to accuse her husband of anything, but I'll take Dylan's side, since no one else in this thread is, and say that maybe he has a hunch and thinks his wife is cheating on him with OP's husband, so he's trying to find a mutual ground to stand on to help him catch Flora. Also, when OP's husband is hanging out with Dylan's wife, it doesn't necessarily make Dylan a ""rando"".

OP, why doesn't your husband invite YOU to the gym and invite YOU to play tennis? I would tell your husband about what you're being told by Dylan and let him give you his side of the story."
"What more is on his plate now than before? From what you describe in the post, you are the one doing pretty much everything, from bills to childcare to household maintenance."
The op wants kids though....
THANK YOU for putting words to my discomfort about this whole ness. 
"Your husband sounds a lot like my dad. He was irresponsible and his poor planning and complete unwillingness to help my mom with ANY household tasks (from bills to cleaning to dishes to laundry to yard chores) somehow always got twisted--it was HER fault he couldn't find his shorts (which he had left on the bedroom floor and kicked under his side of the bed). It was HER fault if he signed up for a new credit card without telling her and the bill went unpaid (bills were not HIS responsibility to take care of).  If he forgot something, her fault for not reminding him. If she forgot something, HER fault for being irresponsible and careless--didn't she even care about her family?!

They are now FINALLY getting divorced. Finally.

I love my dad and I actually don't believe that he is a bad person, or that he does these things intentionally. But he's ruined his own life, and there were ways he could have helped himself. I wish he had seen sooner that he needed HELP.

His mom was a hoarder who also suffered from extreme depression (most likely bi polar, based on the prevalence in his family). He wasn't really *raised*--he and his six siblings basically started raising themselves when the oldest was 14 and  the youngest was 5. They LOVED their mom, but I think all of the kids maybe also buried a lot of deep, deep resentment for her and anger over their pretty fucked up childhood. My dad was paying bills and buying his mom a fridge when he was 14. He KNEW that shit shouldn't have been his responsibility, but I don't think he ever processed his grief for the childhood he never got.

So he married my mom, who is sweet and patient and hardworking, but who is (was--she kicks ass these days) also a relatively meek and easily bullied person. I don't think he ever realized this consciously, but it's like he thinks he already paid his ""adult "" dues when he was a kid, and he was so hungry to be taken care of that he forced my mom into that role that his own mother never provided. I swear to god the man has responsibility-trauma, like any expectation that he'd contribute ANYTHING was met with anxious rage. And yeah hed often apologize. Sometimes he wouldn't, but often he would. It really, really, really didn't make things better.

He was a fucking asshole to my mom and I'm glad she finally demanded a divorce. I am proud of her for it. 

I really do believe that if my dad had started seeing a marriage counselor with my mom (which she BEGGED him to agree to) they might have made things work. They still love each other a lot. Lack of love was never the issue. It took my dad 25 years and divorce papers to finally grasp that every time he took his shit out on my mom, he was forcing her to bear the emotional burden--guilt, stress, regret--that should have been HIS. He did it so reflexively and so unthinkingly.

I hope there is SOMETHING you can say to convince your husband to seek marriage counseling with you. After living with my parents, if I ever found myself in your position, I'd make that an absolute condition of staying. Don't wait until he's ground you down."
"You're not getting it. You're putting words in her mouth. 

&gt;I’ve tried to talk to her about it. She’s not receptive. She says she’s still attracted to me

Why do you think she's lying? Why are you trying to convince her she's lying? You don't know that she is! You're trying to tell her you know how she feels better than you do. "
"I'm not sassing you, and its not against the rules to give advice the OP doesn't want to hear.  

You can't control your boyfriend.  You can control yourself.  You are committing an exercise in futility by trying to convince another adult to do something that their words and actions prove they do not want to do.  We offer advice, not fairy dust to solve your problems without any pain or sacrifice."
"You are creepy and your letter is creepy. Stop saying “wuv.” 

This isn’t about you being nice. None of the stuff you wrote in your post or letter is nice. You are not entitled to a relationship or to intimacy. Maybe being a monk will help you learn about yourself and grow in a way that isn’t so entitled. 

Edited to be less mean and more specific. "
"This is exactly how I feel. Having his mother help would be... uncomfortable. I wouldn’t be able to run my own home the way I want to, and I don’t think I’d ever be able to tell her what to do / push her to help. Plus, there’s a language barrier. I’m learning, but I’m not there yet. 

And I guess I just want him to be an involved dad. My parents had a traditional relationship. My dad just provided the paycheck. I don’t want that. I want a present father for my kids. "
"I think you have a really great attitude, and I wish you all the best. Where were boys (and girls!) like you when I was in high school?! "
Learn to be more assertive. The world won't end if her feelings are hurt.
"Honestly, I think ignoring her would frustrate her more then anything. She clearly wants a response so don’t give her one. Let her be childish and have a tantrum. "
"Yea, no.  Your husband is like OP's.... lazy.

My 12 year old son is ADHD.... and has impeccable bathroom manners.  Always puts down the toilet seat before flushing.  Washes hands and closes the door (tho he doesn't have to anymore) but still does."
"I'm sensitive to latex. I tried one once just to see. I had to stop after only two minutes and I was burning and uncomfortable for days afterwards. No bueno. 

Skyn by LifeStyle is a great brand (average size and pre-lubed). If you're having sex a bunch, you can get them in bulk online (50 for like $20 on condomdepo.com). My partners have said they feel better than latex, too. "
Holy shit. That's such an absolutely horrible thing to say. Fuck him.
"Get out. Be free. Take public transportation. Apply for loans and subsidies and grants for school. You may work hard now but it's time to *work ten times harder*.

This isn't about the preservation of your relationship. This is about the preservation of *you*. Your independence, your self worth, your confidence and trust in other people. 

Don't be pulled into the narcissistic, generational wheelhouse, where your narcissists hold their power over you until you've been brow beaten and broken enough to accept their absurd accusations against others  and demented world view out of pure self preservation.

You don't need that, and you don't want to live like that. If they want to issue ultimatums and create horrible narratives about seemingly kind people out of thin air, do *you* want to stick around?

Edit: a letter"
