"OP are you near a major city of any kind? if so, PM me and I'll look to see if my company has any open positions I can refer you for. We are in pretty much every major city with contracts so that is why i specify major city.

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: Rip inbox and wow gold thank you Reddit. I've seen a lot of people mention that it's rare to see this happen from strangers, and I've already PMed this a couple of times but if have the opportunity to offer someone help, it is your moral obligation to extend your hand so they can recover

Edit 3: no it's not a BS job I actually found him one that would be suitable based on what he knows

Edit 4: update. OP and I are working to get him placed in my company. 

Edit 5: 3 golds? You are too kind reddit. OP and i are working outside of reddit to get him a position. Ive been getting requests for positions a lot, let me just say one thing. I work for a very large company that primarily does IT contracting. I AM NOT A RECRUITER. I am your average system engineer just trying to help a fellow IT dude in need. AS OF 2245 EST NO MORE REQUESTS. I will do what i can to sort through those in my inbox now, but please. Linked in and indeed are the best ways for you to find jobs. If you’re ex mil or have clearance, there are specific websites you can look at (clearance jobs .com and .net are the best). 

Godspeed to those who are searching but don’t worry. Entry level jobs are a dime a dozen. A year and a half ago I was at a service desk fielding calls and hating life and through countless hours of overtime and studying our system, I proved to my company I was better than the rest and was worthy of a promotion faster than normal. Your time will come and when it does you will know. "

"Hey man here's some advice, I've been in this situation a million times and this is the best way to deal with it. Take the drunk persons' phone, ring (depending on the situation I guess) their bf, gf, mom, dad, brother whatever (for me it was mostly a bf or dad). Tell that person on the phone where ""drunk person"" is, wait till they arrive and then clap your hands of the situation.

I've done this more times than I can count. For people I don't even know because of that shit feeling you just don't want to leave someone drunk and alone in the street.

But yeah this is a good way to 1. help them without making it your problem and 2. not feel like a shit person haha!

Edit: also telling the person on the phone this line ""I barely know them I just want to help"" will make sure they come lol"
"This reminds me of an apple joke my grandmother used to tell me.  It's been a while, but here it goes:

A man walks into a bar, and upon sitting down is promptly told, ""This bar is incredible! The bartender serves apples of any flavor, any one that you can think of!"" ""That's incredible, you can't expect me to believe that."" The bartender looks up and says, ""It's true, mate. Any flavor."" ""Okay, do you have coke and rum?"" The bartender serves him an apple. ""No way.. this tastes like coke!"" ""Turn it around"" Says the bartender. ""It tastes like rum!"" Exclaimed the man. A second man takes a seat next to the two, hearing the commotion. ""Hey, mate, you have to try this! The bartender can serve you any flavor apple that you can think of!"" Says the first man. ""You can't expect me to believe that!"" He replies. ""Any flavor."" the bartender says. ""Okay, get me a gin and tonic."" He is handed an apple, and upon taking a bite his face lights up. ""It tastes like gin!"" ""Turn it around"" Says the bartender. ""It tastes like tonic! I don't believe it!"" he exclaims. A third man walks over, hearing the commotion. ""What's the fuss about?"" he asks. All three men who are already seated pipe up about the apples. ""Any flavor, eh? Well... I doubt it. Get me one that tastes like pussy!"" The bartender, as in the previous cases, hands the man an apple. The man revolts, and nearly throws up. ""This tastes like shit!"" He shouts.

The bartender replies ""Turn it around.""

"I made a similar device in high school that I dubbed ""the nutslinger."" it consisted of a bunch of rubber bands, a small Allen key driver as the guide, and a metal nut from the robotics lab as the ammunition. The nut fit nicely over the driver, like a reverse barrel. With three rubber bands, it could penetrate an entire pizza box with pizza inside, and still come out the other side. After discovering this, I swore to never use the weapon again lest something like your story occurred.

For research purposes only of course. And since many people's friends are asking.

"While in College I was riding my bike while holding a smoothie. I saw a girl on a bike coming toward me, rather erratically. It became apparent she was losing control, so I stopped, but before I could move she rammed right into my front wheel. She went over the handle bars and I managed to grab her with my left arm and stopping her fall. Didn’t even spill my smoothie. Anyways, she’s very appreciative, says thanks and then gets back on her bike and leaves. I start to go too only to realize my front wheel is bent. I found out who she was and approached her to tell her of my damaged bike. She yelled at me, said I’d run into her and then stormed off. Felt so betrayed. "

Sprite went everywhere!  Of course being the intellectually curious people we were, we needed to test and see if the results could be repeated so we grabbed a case of Dr. Pepper and decided to have an impromptu soda fight."

I wouldn't take the HR person's word as the final say.  If they want her to work there enough to have offered her a job, there is probably someone that can do something about it.  

ETA:  What about the Pregnancy Discrmination Act?

"**TL;DR**: This also happened to me.

After college, I lived in a shitty apartment with my two best friends, Tito &amp; Ringo (names changed).

We only had two spoken rules to living together:

1. If you fell asleep anywhere outside of your bedroom, you were fair game.

1. If you finished the pitcher of ice tea, it was your responsibility to make more.

One evening, I returned home from work particularly parched. Opening the fridge, I was aghast to discover some dastardly fiend had sidestepped Rule #2 by leaving the subtlest of trace amounts of ice tea in the pitcher; an amount so small, it would be better served in an eye dropper than a mason jar. Tito blamed Ringo. Ringo, still at work, wasn’t home to defend himself. Thus, I blamed Ringo too, putting the pitcher back in the fridge and grabbing a beer instead.


Not that making a pitcher was that onerous of a task (add 4 scoops of powder to a half gallon of water and mix), but I’d rather be damned than to play patsy to such an egregious circumvention of the rules.


Tito, sensing an opportunity to drink, grabbed a Smirnoff Ice out of the fridge, as I took the NASCAR car-shaped church key/magnet off the door. I quickly opened his flavored malt beverage, before turning to open my beer. “Huh,” I remember thinking, “that felt funny.” Looking down at the bottle of beer in my left hand, I discerned that part of the neck of the Harp had come off with the cap. Still sensing something not quite right, I looked at my right hand, still holding the racecar tchotchke. 

Tito asked something like “Are you alright?” 


“I don’t know…” I said, as I dropped the bottle opener onto the counter. That’s when I notice the hooked, one inch gash on the inside of my ring finger.


“Oh shit, I cut myself!”


“Bad?”


“I don’t know.”


It was barely bleeding, but the opposing edges of the wound had taken on an unsettling blue. Then, in flexing the finger, the gash opened, blood began to gush, and beyond the exposed adipose tissue and into the hole, I saw bone.


“Oh, fuck! Yeah, it’s bad,” I said, running the incised finger underwater, as Tito presented me with a paper towel. After wrapping my finger in the towel and applying direct pressure for several minutes, Tito &amp; I discussed possible plans of action:


‘Do you think I’ll need stitches?”


“Shit dude, I don’t know.”


“Fuck!”


“We should call Ringo.”


So Tito called Ringo at work. Over the phone, Ringo’s quickly decided I should go to the emergency room and at least have it looked at. He even offered to reimburse us for the cab fare. “Just go!” he said.


Still, I hemmed and hawed, not wanting to admit the cut was as bad as the obvious evidence said it was. 


For four hours.


Until Ringo got home. 


Running up the stairs and into the apartment, he said something like “What the fuck are you two still doing here?” expecting only to find a note telling him which hospital we had gone to. After taking a glance at my still unclotted, gaping finger, he called me a dumbass, and off we went to the emergency room.


First, I met with a triage nurse who asked me to describe my pain level on a scale of 1 to 10. Holding my finger straight out, I declared a one; gingerly bending the finger, reopening the gash, I declared a nine. The nurse then suggested that I refrain from bending my finger.  


Secondly, I met with an account representative asking for my insurance; I had none. 


Then, we waited. My time was water down the drain.


After what seemed like several episodes worth of bad television, I was taken to a nurse who “tsk’d” when she heard it was a beer related injury, despite my protestations that I hadn’t even had the opportunity to drink any. She then sent in another nurse who soaked my finger in iodine for 10 minutes, warning “now this may sting a little…” 


Afterward, he proceeded to crazy-glue my finger back together; admonishing me not to touch it, lest I adhere another finger to the wound; a complication, he direly warned, happened more often than you might think and one that I most definitely would not enjoy. Given his previous predilection to understatements, I resisted the temptation.


Several hours later, Ringo &amp; I returned home with my finger comically wrapped up like a giant tampon.


Lessons learned from that evening:


* Bad things happen when people don’t follow the rules.

* Only assholes don’t make more ice tea.

* I was finally a grown-up. I had gotten a big booboo and I hadn’t cried.


I actually kept the bottle of Harp, aka the most expensive beer I never drank, as a pseudo-art project for several years afterwards. Residing in the stuffed body of a decapitated Fisher Price glow worm, it was my failed children’s toy: “Baby Broken Beer Bottle.”

**EDIT**: Thanks for the gold.

To answer questions:

* The iced tea in question was ""tea"" in name only: store brand Pathmark Ice Tea was the best dirty sugar water (with a hint of lemon) you could imagine. Truly addictive stuff.

* For over 16 years the villain of this tale remained unknown. Only just recently, Tito casually confessed  ""Oh yeah, that was totally me.""

* Unfortunately, this was not the pinnacle of my finger injuries. That's a tie between lacerating my left pinky on a pull-top can of split-pea soup and putting screw bit through my left thumb.

* Crazy-glue is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.

"I have a student that has tutoring 16 hrs a week. 3 hrs on fri/sat and 2 hrs for all the other days. 

She was getting D's and low C's as well as failing most of her tests. Doesn't help that she was also taking 5 AP classes including calc bc, physics and stats. She ended up with all B's and an A or two so the tutoring definitely helps but yea, 16 hrs a week is rough."

"Never hesitate to go to the doctor. I went for a slight ache in my one testicle (had been like 3 days, I was still working but wanted to check). Turned out to be testicular cancer. 26, healthy, very active, clean diet. Caught it super early and surgery took care of all of it. The weirdest part was while I was waiting for surgery the pain went away after a week or so. If I had have waited the pain likely would have faded and I'd have gone on like normal, within 6 months it could've easily been in my lymphs/kidneys and more."

Hi OP’s mom!
"Omg this reminds me of the horror I recently went through at a movie theater. 
I wanted a hot pretzel as any normal theater patron would. There was a single pretzel hanging in the display case where they keep the pretzels warm. The attendant handed me the pretzel without saying a word. Not thinking anything of it, I went back into the dark theater to continue with my movie and sink my teeth into a nice warm, salted pretzel. I’m 1 in 1,000 people that like tearing my finger food in pieces and eating it that way rather than going right for it. It would not tear apart. Red flag #1. Eventually I said fuck it, dipped part of the whole pretzel in cheese and took a bite. It had no taste whatsoever besides the cheese. Red flag #2. My bf offered to take it back and exchange it with a new one. When he returned, the first thing I said was “that pretzel literally tasted like plastic” he sort of chuckled and gave me the new pretzel. After the movie, all I could think about was that pretzel considering the HUGE difference in taste between the first and second. So I asked my bf if the attendant had anything to say about the pretzel and he just kind of gave me a look. At this point we were just driving away from the movie theater and I KNEW that I had eaten a styrofoam display pretzel that was not even suppose to be displayed in the case to begin with. Turns out, my bf didn’t say anything to me immediately after it happened bc he thought I would make a big scene and ruin the movie (he was totally correct) I made him turn around so I could talk to a manager. He told me he had been telling his staff over and over to not put the decorations in the display case. Apparently three other people before me had taken a bite out of those delicious styrofoam pretzels. He refused to give me a refund for my pretzel and instead gave me four IMAX readmission tickets for any movie I wanted to watch. "

Testicular cancer is one of the most curable ones if caught early enough. Survival rate is something like &gt;95%. It's definitely something you want to know about.

"As does the boyfriend. You could have just as easily said ""she's not my problem"" and left her drunk on the street. He should be grateful that a trustworthy person helped her get home safely. I'm sure there are probably a LOT of shitty people out there that would have jumped at the chance to take advantage of that situation. Good job on being a true gentleman OP. "

Write a TIFU 
"It's probably too late, but I'm gonna write it out anyway.

The deadliest school supply weapon in my day was the pneumatic paper bullet gun.

All you need is one of [these type pens.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/03-BICcristal2008-03-26.jpg/1200px-03-BICcristal2008-03-26.jpg) The key design being that the hole in one end is smaller than the other.

You start by disassembling the whole thing. Toss the butt-cap, keep the tube and the ink cartridge. 

Next you make a super slimy, yet smallish, spit ball. You take that spit ball and put it in the big hole of your pen tube, put the small end exit side down on a desk, book, some kind of flat surface. Use your pen cart to tamp it down into the small hole end of the pen. It needs to be small enough to only fill the tip of the pen and be a consistent cylinder shape that can exit the pen tube.  It will squish out most of the spit and become pretty solid, and firmly lodged into that smaller hole of the pen tube. It takes some practice to consistently make them the right size. Once we'd figured out the right paper size, there were many many ready made dry paper blanks ready to be slobbered up.

Next make a much larger spit ball. Large enough to completely fill in the entire width of the pen tube. Now, you have a tightly compacted yet tiny paper bullet wedged into the small end and a larger slimy spit ball wedged into the back end.

Push the larger spitball through the tube with your ink cartridge, if done right, building up tremendous air pressure behind your small paper bullet until,  CRACK. The air pressure forces the smaller paper bulled from the small end of the pen tube with amazing speed and force. 

Hope this is explained clearly enough, as this was a marvel of Jr. High engineering at the time."
You sound like a man with a worrying amount of experience...
How could you possibly believe this bs.

Well besides the potential brain injury.
"When I was younger we went to Florida for a week and my dad left his car at the airport lot when we left. Got back to a car completely coated in sticky Pepsi, 2 cans were in the back and one was up front in the cup holder. He ended up giving me that car and it still had a stained brown interior roof lol"
"As someone in a school-style rubber band war with the Journeys store across from our place at the mall, any and all makeshift weaponry knowledge is golden. We've been using those monster blue rubber bands and tying them in knots to fling at each other, but I've been working on a foam arrow launcher."
"Similar bike crash while in college but mostly my fault. I was flying full speed hoping to beat a red light on a declining hill and another guy on a bike was flying full speed anticipating he was about to get a green light at the same intersection. I heard someone yell ""yo watch out"" and I turned my head as we collided and flipped forward over the bars landed on my back rolling/skidding to my feet. Felt like a ninja but then saw this other guy rolling and groaning on the ground with a mangled front wheel on his bike. Offered to pay for bike and hospital because I assumed I was fully at fault for likely running a red light. Had his bike all fixed up on my dime, luckily he ended up OK with no need for a hospital visit."

"I've been in this situation, the problem was that the girl (a friend of mine) was an international student with zero family members around. Cabs wouldn't stop when they saw her drunk face, which is understandable. So I had to help her walk to the subway instead. Not a pleasant experience, and in my case there was no way around but to endure everyone in that crowded subway judging me."

**PRIMARY TIPS**

* **Do not drink or do drugs to cope with this.  Go to therapy.**  You frankly can stop reading here.  Everything else I am going to tell you derives from these two points.
*  The state government will pay for you to go to whatever therapist you want, even if you move out of state.  They will do this until you are better.  Pick the best therapist you can find and be greedy with how often you go.
* There is no set timeline for getting over this.  Some people get over this stuff in a month.  Some people take years.  **However long it takes you is okay as long as you are actively engaging in your recovery.**
* Your parents will need to take keep track of a lot of paperwork.  If that is not something they are going to be able to do a good job with, that's okay.  Ask the hospital social worker if you can get a victim's advocate's card and make the victim's advocate handle the paperwork.
* It's okay if your world shrinks for a while.  It's okay if your mom drives you around for a few weeks because you don't feel safe driving yourself around.  It's not okay if you develop a drinking or drug habit.  You will need to pick your emotional battles.  Pick the ones that are going to matter five years from now.
* Fourth of July and New Year's Eve are going to be unexpectedly hard for you because fireworks sound like gunshots.  This completely blindsided me while I was out on NYE--I don't want it to blindside you.

Please also be watchful for signs of PTSD.  Here's a non-exhaustive list of symptoms to watch out for:

* Having bad dreams at night or have trouble sleeping
* Being afraid or nervous
* Feeling very sad or angry or without hope
* Being forgetful or not able to pay attention
* Feeling as if you cannot control your thoughts and memories
* Losing or gaining weight
* Having headaches, stomach aches or problems eating
* Feeling like no one understands you or that your life was stolen from you
* Avoiding places with crowds
* Drinking or doing drugs
* Avoiding talking about the shooting

You might experience a few of these for a while, and then they'll dissipate on their own.  Great!  But if they persist or are interfering with your daily life, you might need to seek professional counseling.  Please hear this: counseling is not anything to be ashamed of.  If you need it, get it.  Seriously.  Like I said above, Florida will pay for it, and society wants you to take advantage of it.  

**WHAT KIND OF COUNSELING SHOULD I GET?**

I did prolonged exposure therapy (PET). I have gotten PMs from folks who did EMDR and liked it.  At any rate, the most important thing is to find a **good** therapist. Someone at the school will develop a list of folks who are qualified to treat you.  If you don't get the list directly given to you, contact your school counselor.  If you don't have access to a list, or if you end up needing a therapist after you go to college, look for a level one trauma hospital in your area.  See if the hospital has an affiliated ""traumatic stress center"" or ""post-traumatic stress center.""  Very often, a hospital that receives GSW patients (like a level one trauma center) has a baked-in PTSD clinic.  If they don't, they can probably refer you to wherever they refer their PTSD patients.

**ARE THERE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR ME IN FLORIDA?**

Yes.  The standard Florida Victims' Compensation Program should apply, and I am confident there will be other financial and medical resources made available to you.  I am also confident that your parents or a social worker will handle all of the paperwork--you should not worry about this today.  If you ever need help figuring out what forms of compensation are available to you, you can contact [the Florida Attorney General.](http://myfloridalegal.com/victims)

**I'M A PARENT AND NEED HELP FIGURING OUT HOW TO TALK TO MY CHILD ABOUT THIS**

[This guide](http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Talking-To-Children-About-Terrorism-And-War-087.aspx) from the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychology might help guide your conversation.

**DOES IT GET BETTER?**

Yes.  You're not the first person to go through this, as awful as it is.  I'm about three years out from being shot, and life is fairly normal these days. I sleep fine. I can go to places that look like where I got shot.  I promise you, it will get easier--and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about what to expect.  

ETA:  A school shooting survivor reached out to tell me that one of the challenges she faced in the wake of her shooting is that some people judged other people’s grief and trauma if they weren’t in the “right” area of the school or something.  She asked me to mention that you may feel the urge to discount or judge someone else’s story by comparing it to yours or to discount or judge your own story by comparing it someone else’s.  That urge is super normal, and you should talk about those thoughts.  (My therapist called it the process of “right-sizing the tragedy”).  Talking about it with friends might make them less likely to get the help they need, though, so to the extent you can save that topic for therapy and your parents, you will probably be doing your friends a favor.

"My mother bought a Ford Expedition King Ranch edition. Not super rare but our county only got two. So one day we go to Target and in the parking lot is the other one! Identical, and right next to it is an open spot so we pull in. Not only do they match, but on the back we had a pink ribbon magnet for breast cancer, and they had a yellow ribbon. My mom and I being my mom and I decide to leave our car unlocked and sit on a bench nearby to see if anything funny happens. Lady with two kids comes out, unlocks the doors to her car as she's digging around in the bags in her hands and the kids quickly get in the right car. She walks up to ours (still not paying much attention) opens the hatch and puts her bags in. Goes around to the drivers door and let's herself in. After about 45 seconds  (I'm assuming she tried her key) we saw her quickly jump out, grab her stuff, and run into her car. The kids were cracking up as she sped off fairly quickly. My mom and I were laughing uncontrollably for a while before we could calm down enough to go shopping. 

No one's as unique as they think they are. "
I can’t believe they took your cash. It’s one thing to stop you from selling the salt. But they definitely shouldn’t have the right to steal your money.
