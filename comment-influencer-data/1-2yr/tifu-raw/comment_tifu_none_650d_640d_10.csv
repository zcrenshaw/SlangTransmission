"&gt; My fingertip unlocks my phone which is great because I can stitch it to my gloves now

I don't even know what to say to this"
why would you _name the alarm????_
So he's flying Seoul-o.
It was 1996. I was 8. Woke up on Christmas morning to run out into the living room to see what Santa had brought me. Presents galore. Looked on coffee table and saw the receipt of said presents. Found out Santa wasn't real on Christmas morning. Didn't care. Got a N64.
"I lost my father when I was 14. He was in a car accident where his car rolled 3 times when he was travelling at highway speeds. I had an opportunity to see him after his body got to the funeral home, but my older brothers told me I really shouldn't. Sometimes I wonder what he looked like, but I'm happy that my brother's were just looking out for me. "

Thats just more protein man
"Reminds me of a story my mother told me a long time ago:

Little kid liked to do drawings with crayons. Would bring ones from home done in using nothing but black. Teacher's aide gets it into her head that kid is ""depressed, suicidal, homicidal, etc."" *without asking anyone any questions*. Makes DCF case because she thinks kid is going to murder someone. Kid gets taken from parents, parents get accused of all sorts of crap. Finally, someone asks kid the simple question ""*Why all black?*""

Kid answers: ""*I live with 5 brothers, sisters, and cousins. The black ones are the only ones that aren't broken.*"""
I'm excited for someone to leak the security footage.

"When my grandfather died a few days after Christmas a few years back, I made a similar mistake. He had died of a heart attack, but he had been aggressively worked over in the hospital ER in the attempts to resuscitate him. I'm sure they pumped him full of fluids and drugs as they continually tried to shock his heart back into normal pumping. When we saw him at the funeral, he looked nothing like the man that was my grandfather. It was jarring, to say the least. I wish I hadn't looked. To this day, I struggle to remember his face when he was alive versus the ghost in that coffin. That need for closure is strong. And an absolute bitch."
Shouldnt it be pingpyong?
At least the car thief‚Äôs gonna get quite the scare when he checks his haul.
"I had a friend who was really worried that her ‚Äúbirth control‚Äù alarm would go off in the middle of a date.  My wife and I just stared at her open mouthed, because apparently the concept of naming it literally anything else hadn‚Äôt occurred to her."
"And considering that you have taken the courses already, and you will have to do them again, you will have the answers.  If you submit an answer that looks like your previous answers, will you still be cheating since you already have the answers???"

"This happened to me a few years ago when I was super sick with the flu. I had a glass of Gatorade on my nightstand and fell asleep in the middle of the day. When I woke up I took a sip from the glass without looking at it. It was covered in ants. COVERED. I was so incredibly sick I didn‚Äôt even care, I was just like, ‚ÄúWell, that just happened‚Äù and I rolled over and went back to sleep. When I finally started feeling better and I thought about what actually happened I was skeeved out, though.

That‚Äôs all to say welcome to the I Drank Ants club."

"I would pay so much money to see that reaction.

There will be confusion, shock, incredulity, fear, panic; like all the good faces you can make, this guy's gonna make em in like 5 seconds."
"Me: Oh great another guy exaggerating saying he ""cut his finger off"".

*looks at the pictures*

Also Me: Holy fuck he actually cut it off.


Kudos to whoever made/maintains the knife you used. That is one clean, sharp cut."
"I would throw up and pass out, this is one of my nightmares."
Ohh this happened a few months back. I have not been able to find my mother and the car is still reported stolen in Poland. However my insurance payed for it so it is something
"I was an apprentice embalmer about a decade ago. It was the year after I graduated high school. A guy that was in my grade shot himself in the head with a 20 gauge slug. He did it about a half mile behind his house on the edge of a corn field (very rural area, obviously). It took like 3 days to find him. The top of his head looked like a banana peel and his brain was pretty much gone (they did find a few pieces and some of his skull). His head was filled with maggots.

So, they bring him to the funeral home I worked at about 2 AM. They called me in and told me the situation (I already knew he had been missing) and asked if I could handle it. I said that I would try (we weren't close or anything, so I wasn't really attached to him).

I got there and saw the body. It was in pretty good shape considering he laid outside for three days in the middle of a midwest summer. We embalmed him like normal (look up the process if you really want to know how it works). As far as the head, one of my bosses had an idea and ran across the street to his house. He came back like 10 minutes later with a Nerf basketball (the squishy ones that come with the mini basketball hoop). He cut it in half and put it in the guy's skull cavity (after we cleared out the maggots, of course) and it totally fit! He then had the idea of trying to have an open casket. We thought he was crazy but he insisted.

We sewed up the pieces of flesh that had peeled back with a stitch that was practically invisible from the outside, filled the hole with wax, amd slathered him in makeup. The whole process took like 1w or so hours, as compared to a regular embalming that takes about r to 6 hours. He actually looked really good. Other than the copious amounts of foundation, he looked as good as any other dead body. My boss did an amazing job.

We showed his parents and his dad said he looked good enough for an open casket. So that's what we did. Everyone there was flabbergasted that a guy who shot himself in the head, with a slug no less, cpuld have an open casket. I know that really made things easier on his parents, sister, family, amd friends to see him one more time. It was definitely an experience I'll always remember."
Welcome to Poland! (source: am polish. Hotel staff always helped me with my corpses.)
"In Maori culture here in NZ, its normal for the body to be put in an open casket on the floor of the wharenui (meeting house) , with the deceased surrounded  by close loved ones. This typically goes on for a few days in preparation for burial, and people will essentially sleep with the dead. And us Maori do this no matter the condition of the dead. I've seen people who have half a neck from trying to hang themselves - all the way through through to people who look like skeletons with skin.

Sometimes it can be a bit of a shock at first, but in a fucked up way I think it's also a good thing; people don't beat themselves up for days on end wondering if such and such really are dead, or how they died, etc. It helps people move on with their lives. 

"
Did your parents leave it there as maybe a hint? I know my parents were getting pretty sick of not getting any credit. They spoiled is rotten.
"Are you ok OP? Need something off your chest?

Did anyone, hurt you? Down there? "
"I was on a plane to go say goodbye to my grandfather when he died.  The chaplain had instructed the organ people that I would be coming by to say goodbye before they went to work on him to harvest his corneas and femurs, and a few other bits that were viable.  Only they didn't wait, and the chaplain didn't find out until he walked me into the morgue and it was too late to tell me not to see him.  He was a mess and it was pretty f'd up.  At least I was able to keep my mom from coming in to see him agin as I was walking out."

"I'VE UPVOTED SO MANY PUNS TODAY I'M STARTING TO REGRET THE INTERNET.  HERE, TAKE THIS ONE AND BE ON YOUR WAY."
"I was asleep on the couch one school morning when I was about seven, and I'd just lost a tooth. I sort of woke up without quite moving yet as her ex left for work, and I guess she didn't notice because a minute or so after he leaves I hear her open the front door and call out ""Wait! I need cash for Mouse's tooth!""

I wasn't even upset, more amused by the fact that my mom slipped up that hard. I still give her shit for it almost 20 years later."
"My dad was shot shot and killed when I was young. My uncle asked the funeral director if it would be an open casket. The funeral director glanced at me and said 'no'.  Being 11 I wasn't given all the details and assumed that he was shot somewhere in the body. After that I knew he was shot in the head/face. It was bad enough losing him, but never seeing him that last time was really rough for me."
FUCK MAN WHAT THE FUCK
"Some teachers assign things and then get upset when a student doesn't do exactly what they expected. Also, sometimes people read too far into things. My little cousin had to write a poem about 9/11 this year for a class and then got sent to the school therapist because her writing made her seem sad. "

Not as bad as the Squirrel Girl me and my friends know. We call her that because one day at the park we saw her put nuts into her mouth and then dig holes and plant them with her hands. She also ate a wallet so I‚Äôm guessing she wasn‚Äôt totally there in the mental scene.
Gotta say... That's a super hardcore way to cut your thumb nails
"Turns out I just got a warning to basically, not do that again.  But for this issue to last two days, and I resolved it in about 30, I should be commended!!"
"I used to be bothered by ants when I first got here to Hawaii, where ants are everywhere. After a couple of months of tossing food cause of ants (literally set a dish down and less than two minutes later it was crawling), I see my room mate cooking food. He sets the plate of chicken down on the counter and sure enough, the ants swarm. He turns around and sees the chicken crawling with ants and tosses it into the pan anyways. When I asked him about it, he simply said ‚Äòif you throw it out, the ants win.‚Äô I haven‚Äôt been bothered by them since. "
"""Sorry I got hit by a car, couldn't type out the report because my arms were broken. I know it's completely my fault and next time I'll aim for the truck instead and hope it just severs my head"""
"I can just imagine the horror on the first exterminator's face as he slowly backs away, careful not to disturb the spiders, fumbles for his radio, and, in a broken, shaky voice, mutters ""dispatch, I'm gonna need backup..."""
What? Did this happen in the past or is this happening right now? You can‚Äôt end on a cliffhanger like that.
"The thing that my mom did was have gifts from Santa, and *and* gifts from her, too. We eventually figured it out because they both had the same handwriting. "
"Who is upset about a sad poem about 9/11? It sounds like the teacher should be learning some empathy, not the child."
"When my father was laying in his casket, he looked like a wax dummy of himself.  Cleanly shaven and trimmed up, very unlike the 'real life' him.  His hands were crossed over his chest, and I thought, 'When's the next chance I'm gonna have to touch a dead body?'  So I put my hand over his ice cold, putty like hand.  Before then I was kind of in shock over the whole thing, literally laughing at my sister while she called to tell me he was dead.  I didn't believe it until then.  It was a real bummer, turned me into a sniveling mess."
"My great grandfathers funeral was closed casket. 

I was like 7 when it happened, and didn't really think anything of it.

As an adult I found out what happened. He slipped outside in the winter most likely froze to death if he didn't die from the head injury he got from the fall. His face was then devoured by the feral dogs that wandered the area."

"This hits home. Here in the states we don‚Äôt have anything remotely like this but seeing my mother climb into my dads casket after everyone left the viewing room and it was just me, bro, Mom and her sister it really Hit home how sad she was. I can see why your culture does this kind of deal. It‚Äôs been since November of ‚Äò15 since he passed and moms just now getting her shit together. Dad was an organ donor so not much of him was there except head, hands and whatnot she kept trying to look up his sleeve and asking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up there? That‚Äôs not his arm, what is that?‚Äù I believe he donated marrow so Im sure it was some kind of plastic/rubber imitation deal. "
"Now she can be part of the tradition. Instead of surprising her with it, you can all take turns coming up with the cleverest ways to stage the elf around the house. This can take something that would have run out of steam in a year or two and turn it into something that will last your whole lives. "
My parents never did Santa either because they thought Santa getting credit for all their gifts wasn't right. 
"Stores open to the public CANNOT force you to stop and show them your receipt/check your merchandise. Once you've purchased it, it is yours and you a free to leave, period. Membership stores are a bit different. 

Forcing you to stop or detaining you is technically unlawful arrest, a crime. Technically you can resist with as much force as is reasonably necessary. 

Now if the alarm goes off, even if you definitely purchased the item, you still have to stop and show them proof. And if they see you conceal something and not pay for it, they can obviously stop you. Whether this is legal or not hinges on if they were correct or not.

"I've done the same thing myself.

My friend committed suicide back in March.

I picked up his cousin and was one of the first people on the scene besides police and paramedics.

After comforting his cousin for a bit and learning that he was out on the fire escape, for some reason I wanted to see... Part of me felt like it wasn't real.

So I walk over to the side of the building, and he's sitting on the second story fire escape. He's covered with a sheet, but his legs and shoes were visible. I broke down then.

After talking to police and a few other family members that showed up, I was getting ready to leave, and I just wanted to say goodbye to him.

So I walk around to the side of the building and look up. He was uncovered now. Saw his face, and it was blue and swollen. He had hung himself.

I wish I hadn't walked over there."
"Well, he had been a sailor (of sorts), so I don't really see what the problem was. Then again, I'm not Catholic. "
Something about this story smells off.
Everyone embellishes their story at least a little bit. Unless their was something seriously wrong with that girl I don't think his hair was literally crusty or his body was literally covered with slime. It's just water. Gross water that contains traces of human bodily fluids but still water.
You sound like a real life Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes.

"His family were staunch Catholics,and just didn't like the irony. I have to say, I think my company hugely over-reacted but if I really caused so much upset to the (shocked, emotional, grieving) family as claimed, well, to this day I still feel I was sacrificed in an attempt for the company to be 'seen to be doing something.'
Me? I'd have told the family (thousands of miles away) that the person responsible had been sacked. Then I'd give me a mild warning to be more careful next time, and close-out the issue.

"The problem with the Tooth Fairy is that she is overworked. She just can't get to everyone as quick as she used to. After all, kids' teeth are falling out at an unprecedented rate. The soft drink epidemic is partially to blame. Jenny McCarthy telling everyone that fluoride makes children artistic hasn't helped. And Kool-Aid branching out into the toothpaste industry has been particularly damaging. As a result, efforts have been made to bring on temps to help the Tooth Fairy out. Unfortunately, they have been unsuccessful thus far. None have gotten past the screening process, the one which all magical entities must pass if they hope to work around children (thanks, Catholic Church). The Canine Pixie was deemed ""mentally unfit,"" what with her anxiety disorder and addiction to cough medicine. Still, she did better than the Molar Troll. Turns out, he accepted more than traditional currency, like US dollars and Dave and Busters tokens, in his previous occupation as toll collector on a bridge.

Long story short, she's just stupid as hell but I hope she learned something from that situation. "
"That is where i expected to go.

Honestly im not religious, and even I'd be ok with the patron saint of traveling being marked on my coffin for my journey home."
I'm really sorry dude. I know that's gotta be rough. 
"Seeing everyone share ant drinking stories makes me glad I'm not the only one.
Came home from a movie, took a sip from a mug of sprite I left on the counter. Smelled like chlorine. Turn on the lights, ants everywhere on the counter. The mug was an ant drowning pool."
Never heard of this tradition but it sounds kinda weird. Honestly I don't think kids really care about these sorts of things. They might get excited at the prospect of a reward but you don't need to go to massive lengths to trick a child into thinking something is magic. Everything is magic when you're a kid.
How curved is absurd? Although I'm not a hand model I don't want an ingrown thumb nail
"Were those gopniks who stole it? They wear a cheap sport-suit, a leather cap and pointy leather shoes. Also they carry a purse and beads. ( Got to know by some googling )"
"Damn, didn't know getting visas took so long.. I got mine (born and mostly raised in Florida) to go to Cuba the day before I got on the plane lol "
"I work for a much larger company than this. When those reply-all chains start, they last for several hours. My favorite part is when people start replying all with memes."
"Holy crap I just realized that ""the black ones"" referred to the crayons"
The real tifu is always in the comments.
"""A student on hospital placement"" good God this is out next generation of medical professionals... We really are screwed..."
Well the loss of her corpse is not that big of a deal honestly. I have tried to convince myself that it is just a bag of flesh and that my mother was already long gone.
"My parents were so funny with this. They used a different writing instrument (ex their presents were pen, Santa's were marker), made sure Santa had different handwriting. They even had a couple of rolls of giftwrap that only Santa used from year to year (in case we remembered that Santa used it last year, and they used it this year I suppose).

I'd put out cookies and milk, and carrots for the reindeer every year. Even when I started to suspect it wasn't real, because I knew it was my dad eating them and I wanted to give him special ones."
