You ever fucked a girl so hard you made her deliver a ghost baby right then and there

&gt;He says ""I will.  Actually they ask for you sometimes. Weird, oh well.""
&gt;
He knows its you and he's plotting his revenge.

"He's telling all his friends about this right now, just not as a TIFU. "
I imagine a certain amount of redditors grabbing a towel right now to see if it is really that bad.
I cant wait to hear from the boss's perspective in a few years.
"Man makes machine, machine does job, but like Icarus, man gets greedy and flies too close to the sun, cutting half of their foreskin off."
I think a lot of people would be astonished to see their true genetic family tree overlaid on their historical one.  I found out I was a doorstep baby and the lies running through the generations before ours are mind boggling. 
TIFU by accidentally waterboarding myself while fucking a coconut
Make sure you pop it under the Christmas tree so your dick can wear its little xmas sweater on the big day!
TIFU by serving expensive steak to a moron
Why anyone would put a drill anywhere near their manhood is beyond me. And then to automate it! Jesus fucking Christ.

Tifu by not torrenting all the shows I wanna watch for the next 3 years ahead of time. 
I'm pretty sure that would be a TIF...
This post gave me anxiety just reading it 
Some guy gave his father my phone number.  His father calls from time to time asking to speak to his son.  He yells at me because he thinks I'm the guys girlfriend and am keeping his son away.  It's really heartbreaking because obviously this guys son has no interest in having the dad in his life.  It may be easier for the father to think that some girl is keeping his son away.
To make it public and as a result he discovered that he's his own grandpa 
"Silver lining: If it had happened  today, it would be captured on video and all over Internet. For. Sure."
Yeah. Tomorrow we're going to get a petty revenge story lol.
Well did you find the other piece of foreskin in your room?

"Amazing, I went to a pretty big school and it made the rounds there, I wouldn't be surprised if my humiliation was dragged out into the greater Melbourne region."
"Oh god

I feel like i should say something"
Someone did the same thing to me but with her grandparents. Each time they called I would have to explain again she wasn‚Äôt there. One day they asked if they could just talk to me for a little while.
"I just got a DNA test. I had the choice of making my results private or public. There was a warning that if you make the results public, you might discover previously-unknown relatives."
This was painful to read
"Once my gf (now wife) took a massive, gigantic shit that wouldn't go down no matter what. We tested a few techniques, because we also didn't have a clogger, and here is what you should do: put liquid soap in the toilet, break the shit with something and pour hot water on it. Like 2L of hot water is fine. It was a beautiful moment of building intimacy in our relationship. "
"I‚Äôm a high school science teacher, and about 15 years ago I spent a year teaching science in Bogot√°, Colombia at a private school. Rich kids, raised in Spanish and English. Great kids, in fact. 

I was teaching genetics with one group and we were looking at blood types. Unlike North America, identification in Colombia includes blood type (seriously, this is a great idea for emergency situations, no idea why it isn‚Äôt here) so it‚Äôs common for people to know the blood types of their entire family. We did blood tests in class and the students were able to see that it matched up with their ID info. We then used this info with their family‚Äôs blood types to look at pedigrees. 

One of the girls in the class came up to me after class with a concern. I don‚Äôt remember the exact blood types, but her parents blood types didn‚Äôt fit. Basically, there was no way her dad was her dad. I fumbled through some bullshit possibility of a mutation, but I learned my lesson - never again will I have students do blood type pedigrees with their families. "
Might be the funniest comment of the day. I actually lol'd. Then it made me think of the red women from game of thrones.
Would a solution be to reschedule the return flight for 2 days earlier?

You seem Ajitated....
"I used to be a travel agent; I‚Äôm so sorry that you weren‚Äôt advised this. 

It does seem strange though - did you give copies of your passports to him? If so, it‚Äôs usually our duty of care to check the expiry dates. Same if we give you any visa documentation/information. 

Check your flight itineraries as well; ours had in large writing ‚ÄúPASSPORT MUST HAVE SIX MONTHS VALIDITY FROM RETURN DATE‚Äù or something similar on it. 

If yours doesn‚Äôt and you weren‚Äôt advised about any of it, I‚Äôd be going back to the agency and seeing what can be done. 

Your uncle should be able to get a fair amount of his money back depending on the circumstances as well. Lots of hotels will be non-refundable within 24 hours but sometimes you can cancel prior to then for a small nominal fee and get the rest back. 

As others have said, this isn‚Äôt just a Kenyan rule, it‚Äôs a rule for a lot of countries. 

It‚Äôs enforced in most African nations, almost all of Asia as well as Australia and the South Pacific. I believe Canada, the US and Mexico also have these rules except for one another (so an American can travel to Canada and only have 3 month validity but a New Zealander would require 6 months validity). 

Again, I‚Äôm sorry this has happened but I would take up something with your travel agent/agency. It might be harder if they‚Äôre just a small local business but if it‚Äôs a chain, you‚Äôll have a lot more luck. "
TIFU by deliberately waterboarding myself with a coconut.
This happened to me during sex and it was a cyst rupture.  It does indeed feel like birth contractions.  Please get an ultrasound if you haven't already.
Did you get the sodas at least?
"Dude, you just saved my trip to Thailand, I'm going to renew my passport tomorrow morning "
what i want to know is if the exam really was that easy or if you were just so out of it that you thought it was easy. 
"Because normally without the towel you can spit the water out and breathe. But with the towel on your face at first you can pour water through it, and once it‚Äôs wet you can‚Äôt breathe back out."
"Ouch, I just felt something break..."
The funniest part of this to me is that the dude decided to chuck the whole steak.... would the boss think he ate the whole thing in that short amount of time???? Think it through buddy..
TIL in Australia they call them V-Plates. 
Wait is this another thing about that aged panini guy
Lol water sports must not be her thing.
"Ive read the destroy dick guy and the coconutters, but for some reason your story made me more uncomfortable than both of those, so props. "
"I have sent faxes and voicemails to all senators and reps that are relevant to me and they've either said ""yep we're with you"" or ""fuck off"". What now? Honestly, this shit is exhausting. I want neutrality and I think most other people do too-- but how many times do I have to yell myself blue in the face before this issue is settled once and for all?"
"I just can't get over how bad the story is on so many levels. 

1. Humiliated himself in front of hot girl
2. Probably embarrassed her and made her hate him
3. Was witnessed by all the cool kids, other girls, and circle of nerd buddies.
4. Got friends kicked out of party.
5. People probably thought the whole thing was intentional
6. Piss off dad and make him drive all night for dumb reason
7. Wait hour and a half for a ride before you can leave.
8. Still have to sit with all your pissed off friends and dad on the way back.
9. You ruined everybody's night."
I remember the story well. Very fun to hear the other side. 
"Could be an ovaruan cyst rupture, evt. ovarian torsion with spontaneous detorsion? I suppose the doctor did an ultrasound to look for an adnexal mass? üòä The explanation she gave sounds extremely unlikely to me!"
You‚Äôre incredible OP. You both have experience being waterboarded and understand the mechanisms behind it.  
TIFU by not going back in time and convincing more people that this was an important issue.  Obligatory this happened last week.
"Doctor was a lady, when I told her he wanted to try a new position, she just looked at him and rolled her eyes... priceless!"
"Because you need to show the drill that you're not afraid of it,  you need to show the drill who's the man. "

We actually went out with a few of his friends last night and they were all giving me looks and high fiving him like he had won the lottery.
"I feel like masturbating, I need a drill and some screws."
Alright Stannis
"I've done something similar. Sad part was it was only a few years ago. I was 22 or so at the time. Few friends and I decided to try it. Set up a bench stool in the backyard on a slant. Grabbed the towel and just a  few water bottles. We drew straws on who would go first. Came up with the thumbs up your good, keep the torture up. Thumbs down help, get the towel off and stop dumping the water. Well I was up first. Laid down on the bench put the towel over my face and gave the thumbs up. Friends started pouring water and within 2 or 3 seconds I felt like I was being suffocated. Tried to hold my breath just to experience the effect until I had to give them the thumbs down to stop pouring. All in all it wasn't horrible, but the thought of actually being tied up and water boarded for real is a whole lot scarier now. If you do try it, have a buddy system going at least. Glad you're okay OP."
Plot twist: years later you see her in a golden shower video.
"Yes! I can.

hey there, /u/mrs_defenestrator, how *you* doin?"
"If you had to give scans to the travel agent, 100% go back to him and say that he hasn‚Äôt done his due diligence for your flights. It was part of our job to check expiry dates; if this had happened at my agency, we would be 100% liable. "
He is OP‚Äôs biological grand father.
Buy a plunger before you need a plunger.

Only upvote because similar circumstances kept me from grandmother's funeral in Russia

It would've been amazing if he pulled it off only to have the steak splat on the windshield of her car.

" The 4th of June is only five months from the 4th of January though.  With their current tickets, they'd need passports valid until the 6th of July. "
Is it not something like A Shit Pie?
Can someone ELI5 how waterboarding actually works? What about the towel makes it any worse than just pouring water on someone‚Äôs face? 
"&gt;South East, so it holds up. That's really funny.

"That's it, that is all the political power a US citizen holds. "
This literally happened to an old Science Teacher named Mr. Wolfe from our school. He did it in the 90's and accidentally outed an adopted girl who didn't know her parents weren't biologically her parents. He never did the finger prick tests for blood types again. 
"When everyone is consensual it's not so bad. Unfortunately, waterboarding is often not a consensual activity. "
Use it as a lesson
"OP I'm so sorry :( I work for a travel insurance company and anytime I hear cases like this it breaks my heart. Fuck your TA (travel agent) for not going over passport/visa requirements for such an expensive trip. I've found that some TAs can be real lazy POSs often passing the work off to a department like mine just because they can. I'm hoping you feel my virtual hug, OP. I sincerely hope things work out for the better for you and your family. "
I knew this sounded very familiar. Thanks for the laugh. 
"The exact same thing happened to me except my girlfriend's parents (that I had yet to meet before this,) had to hear that I ruptured (at the time, current wife) an ovarian cyst. They are pretty normal... But when the cervix is hit they can rupture. Well it happened after we had sex she had started to have some pain and it was just getting worse until she couldn't even stand.

Like idiots we didn't think it was sex related and we told her parents we were taking her to the ER.

The doc told us with a blank face that it was caused by aggressive sexual contact.

Her mom freaked the fuck out and started texting her asking if she used BC, ECT "

Its somewhat depressing to hear their hopeful machismo turn into dejected comprehension."
"It also bears noting that a lot of these tests don't recognize Native American ancestry because many Native American tribes have not submitted to the genetic testing necessary in order for the genes to be recognized. I'll try to link the study that I saw regarding this but many of these genetic testing sites do not have adequate samplings of Native American genes in their registries in order to be able to recognize Native American ancestry. Just something to consider when having these tests done. Sorry for your troubles, OP."

"For once, I'm actually disappointed to find that this wasn't a ""This was a few years ago but..."" story.  I'm genuinely curious about how much circumcision affects sexual enjoyment, but it's pretty rare to find someone who's experienced both sides of the story.  When you've had several months for healing and for the nerves to become accustomed to having that area in contact with underwear and such all the time (as opposed to protected behind foreskin) would you mind letting us know what the differences are?  Like a 1 year update/AMA type thing?"
"Once I took an ambien and took a shower. I don‚Äôt remember this happening but my boyfriend loves to tell the story. He said he heard water splashing and was asking if I was okay. I never answered so he came in and the lights where off, and I was in really hot water and had put a washcloth over my face and was letting water cover the wash cloth and when he pulled it off o was gasping and he asked what I was doing and I mumbled and he asked again and I said ‚Äúwaterboarding myself to see if I can survive‚Äù he pulled me out of that shower. I then went and made a peanut butter sandwich... on the palm of my hand but that‚Äôs irrelevant. "

"My mom has found out a couple people in her family are the result of affairs. She said she isnt going to tell her siblings.

"From what I've heard, by the time babies are old enough to be aware of things and indicate to parents where something hurts, it's long since healed and they've become used to it.

"The reason you instinctively can't breath when water hits your face is the same reflex that sometimes causes a cold wind to ""steal your breath.""  It's a much stronger reaction in babies - they will hold their breath if you just blow gently in their face. 


...Which means waterboarding should be extra effective against babies. And now I'm on a list. "
That behavior is beyond unacceptable for a grown man. Have you had him checked for Aspergers? 
"Oh buddy, I did that months ago."
"‚ÄúDid I pass my exam?‚Äù

"As someone who gets nonstop calls about my credit cards (I don‚Äôt have any), cruises I‚Äôve won, my car warranty running out, and generally people looking for someone else, I am constantly afraid people are giving out my phone number.

"We found out the neighbor kid growing up down the street from my mom and her 5 brothers in Boston was actually... their half brother.  (Our Grandpa had an affair with the lady down the way and the poor boy was told when his parents died but never told my family.) Our new ‚Äúuncle‚Äù finally let us all know the day of our Grandfather‚Äôs funeral- telling the family he had promised his mother to keep it a secret until then. Of course this posed the interesting situation of my Grandmother learning of her husband‚Äôs affair 65 years ago- and also realizing the boy she had over to play with her children for years (and even once kissed my mother before he knew) was the product of said affair. We expected fireworks. Instead, her response is one I still am amazed by... ‚ÄúWhat a blessing! I have another son!‚Äù She passed away two years later, firmly having accepted him as one of her own.

I yelled at many of them to tell ‚Äúguys name‚Äù to stop giving out the wrong number. 

One day his bank calls about a loan he applied for. I politely tell the bank employee that ‚Äúguys name‚Äù has been giving out the wrong number and that the bank has the wrong number.

 Fast forward several months... One of his high school buddies show up at our horse barn looking for him with a beautiful woman that he's engaged to and wants to introduce her to my son AND ask him to be in the wedding.

Turns out He didn't believe her and kept texting her random (apparently hilarious) crap thinking he's sending it to my son. Eventually, she started to reply to his texts, pretending to be my son.

That sucks. What happened? As someone who is feeling the pain right now I'm sorry you had to feel it at a time before
This is /r/tifu and I recommend divorce. What kind of socially broken nightmare of a human being thinks this and then does it?
Actually I'm curious too. My gf is tiny and sometimes ill uh... bump the back end. We try new stuff all the time and I dont want this position to be one of them.
"Hijacking top comment. Do NOT post your ticket info. The barcode has all kinds of information embedded in if. Your Name, itenary, frequent flyer number etc. With that info it is possible for someone to log into your accounts and cancel or change the itenary and end up costing you more."
Thanks -- I hope so! It'll be another couple of years until we can tell both of them.
"Better yet, follow the pic up with a winky face and the words ‚Äúmy friends call me ‚ÄòAndy‚Äô‚Äù (or whatever nickname would be appropriate for the girl)"
This literally happened to me but resulted in an ambulance ride and I had also had a cyst to burst on impact so to speak and my boyfriend was over there feeling like a legend they gave me dilaudid I was so high from it that I blurted out about how well endowed he was with his mom in the room and she said we sure know he doesn‚Äôt take after his dad then. Everyone died with laughter üòÇ

Message your rep otherwise itll be bad"
I didn't know the Inbetweeners had an Aussie spinoff
I like that this is tacked on as a separate comment.  Really seals the emotion into a nice little compartment.
You married a real life Homer Simpson.

"Thank you very much for the support. Ya, honestly I'm just so pissed at my TA. We gave him photocopies of our passports when he was booking the ticket so he had a big opportunity to tell us. But then again, I should have at least known, but me being me, not travelling a lot, and worrying about final year high school, I didn't check. This definitely was a learning experience. Just sucks that it had to be given out in such a hard way"
"It would have been more amazing to hear his ridiculous, half-wit explanation to how he ""ate"" the entire steak in a matter of a few seconds."
"&gt;  as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.

I can feel it. "
"&gt;She laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased.

Since both of you are here,  is this true ? "

"I know it sounds so simple, but remember that women didn't always have the options they do now in terms of spousal selection, marriage, sex, and divorce.  In a modern country,  if a woman is unsatisfied, unhappy,  or abused, she has the option to leave/get help (hopefully).  This was not always so. 


There is also the very awful possibly of unreported rape.  

Due to these possible factors, if I found out one of my grandfathers wasn't my biological grandfather, it would go no further than me.  The possibility that one of my grandmothers was unfaithful would be overshadowed by the possibility that she was a victim.  And as much as I abhor cheating, even if she did have an affair, I am sitting from a position of immense privilege, married to a man I chose  when I was a full and educated adult, whom I could leave without much stigma, if I needed or wanted to. 

We need to consider the possible circumstances.   "
That woman killed a man in a hospital and nobody did ANYTHING?!
"It's not much of a story.. 

I knew I had to pee before but not that badly, and I was too horny to notice it anymore. 

I finally came and I knew right away it wasn't just cum... there was a good amount of piss... but like usual, she swallowed. All of it.

She had a weird look on her face and asked if I had to pee.. I said ""no why?""  

She said something like ""it was just A LOT of it and it was watery and...""

I just said no, I guess I just came a lot

We both knew..."
"So much misinformation in comments. It's super common to have countries require a passport that's valid 3-6 months after arrival date.

This is due to VISA regulation. Ex. I go to the US and can stay there for 6 months per the VISA rules. If I have a flight leaving after 3 months, I can cancel that flight and stay for 3 months more.

And in that case my passport would have to be valid. Hence the rules. "

Once I fucked my girlfriend too hard and gave myself a hernia.
Nice story

"I just experienced a similar dna wtf. I have also always been interested in DNA and decided to do 23andMe. I felt like I was reading Microsoft terms of service so I just started clicking accept while completing my profile. Turned out I enrolled in connect with other 23andMe customers who share dna. A few days after I received my results I got notified I had a connection. Interesting, I don‚Äôt know anyone in my family that had taken a dna test. 

The connection showed we were 1st or 2nd cousins. A little background, I know very little about my father‚Äôs side of the family. The person who submitted the DNA was the parent of a boy adopted at birth from my home state. We begun communicating and trying to figure out who this kid‚Äôs father was. The DNA ruled out any of my father‚Äôs siblings, so it had to either be one of my father‚Äôs sibling‚Äôs children or another completely different branch of family. I got in contact with the only person from my father‚Äôs side I knew which was his sister and I barely know her. I tried to introduce the adopted mother and my aunt over Facebook but apparently my aunt doesn‚Äôt understand how to hold conversations over Facebook, only how to forward spam. So I was stuck trying to figure it out because I felt bad for my cousin not knowing who his father was as I also grew up without my father in my life. Long story short, I reluctantly called my aunt and explain everything and wondered if she knew who the father was. Turns out the father was my aunt‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs son. He apparently raped a girl 15 years ago at a party (the birth mother claimed but didn‚Äôt file charges), the adopted parent believe she lied to stay out of trouble.  After some further investigation of the boy‚Äôs biological father, both the adopted mother and I agreed it was best left a mystery. The dude is like a serious criminal. I‚Äôm ashamed I am even related. On the bright side the adopted mother and I both share the same professional career path which is specialized information technology and are planning to meet up and she‚Äôll introduce him to myself and my siblings. 

The point of this story is DNA testing can reveal some serious family wtfs . Lastly, my aunt was devastated that she is 68% Irish, I also have wet ear wax and my second toe is longer than my first toe. 23andMe knows me well. "
"Best line from the show.

I knew I needed better friends"
Did the principal find out about the other school's meme pages? 
You'd be surprised by how much perfectly good stuff gets thrown out every day.
"Same here, elderly lady calls me about once a month and I try to explain there is no ""Jon"" here but I hope he is doing well. Sometimes I'll talk to her for a bit. If I miss her call it's always this heartbreaking voicemail of how she misses Jon and wishes to hear from her grandson. She always ends with ""I know you are probably busy but just keep in touch hun."" I wish I could find Jon and smack him upside the head. Could be more history to them but seems like this woman genuinely cares."
