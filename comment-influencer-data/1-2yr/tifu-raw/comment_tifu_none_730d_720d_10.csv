"Some advice from someone in Healthcare:  
Breast tissue is mostly fat, skin, lymph, milk ducts, and some blood vessels. The outermost layer is thinner and more sensitive. Without blistering, it sounds like a borderline 1st to 2nd degree burn.  
Baby it to a degree. If you can get some Silvidine cream, use that. It's expensive because it has silver in it and is known to almost completely reduce scarring (other variables and stuff). Burns should not be dried out.  
Inflammation is normal and good for injuries and illness. The outer layer could dry up and scab over but do NOT pick at it. Cover it when you must, apply triple-antibiotic ointment, and in later afternoon/night let air get to it.  
Note: No matter how or when 'the mood' might strike....always wear underclothes in the kitchen or doing similar tasks. I tried cooking burgers on the stove with just swimming trunks on....no scars but hot oil......  
Lastly, scar tissue (depending on size and location) is permanent."
"I played this for my 7 year old tonight because he said he was scared and couldn't sleep. He laughed until he cried and is now sleeping soundly. Great lullaby, thank you."
"You need to get you some good roach bait traps. Not the cheap shit at Walmart, good bait traps. Because I doubt seriously if you killed them all and if you didn't you WILL have a whole new infestation in the coming months. Especially if you are not super good with cleaning after yourself. Oh...and be glad it was roaches instead of bedbugs."
It's weird that you had strict parents that would prefer you walk through 4 villages at night with foxes and bloodthirsty Danes wondering between the villages but wouldn't let you stay the night at a mates

"Try emailing the teacher about it. Hopefully she'll understand.

Sometimes I forget that people find things like that vulgar/upsetting/offensive. The internet completely desensitized me long ago so there's very little that would make me turn a movie or show off in disgust.

When I drop the bar soap in the shower I like kicking it up the curved walls of the tub and trying to catch it
"You don't see them around it because they're all inside of it, duh.  Next time it's sitting on your lap, thousands of them will come pouring out of the vents, slip under your waistband, and try to force their way into your pee-hole."
"Are those the ones that you can bring a boot heel down on, scrape back and forth, and they survive completely unscathed?"
Did you run through a field of wheat? I hear that's the naughtiest thing one can ever do. But seriously your parents suck ass. 
The only way to fix this is to make another reunion and show a picture of yourself naked 
I did that too until I kicked the tub faucet and cut the side of my toe

&gt;The German cockroach is very successful at establishing an ecological niche in buildings, and is resilient in the face of many pest control measures. Reasons include:

&gt; * short reproductive cycle


&gt; * the ability to hide in very small refuges


&gt; * sexual maturity attained within several weeks, and


&gt; * adaptation to and immunity from chemical pesticides

That girl was probably there meeting her Tinder date as well.

Just try and talk to a girl with the confidence you had when talking to the girl that looked like your date and, with a little luck, you'll have spontaneous dates.

"I had something like that happen with a job interview. I was told by the recruiter to meet the guys in a pub up the road from the company. I pitched up and asked the bartender if he knew about these guys from this compay. ""Yes"", he said, ""but they're doing an interview right now, you can just sit here and wait till they're done"". I order a beer since I can see them slamming back a few... and the time passes... and passes... and eventually we're going into night time and they're just sitting there drinking with this other guy. Eventually I gather some courage and go ask them if it's going to be my turn soon... ""Who the hell are you?"", ""I'm X"", ""No, this is X"" ... point at dude they've been interviewing. Somehow two different recruiters at the recruiting company got the message that ""X"" had been asked to come for the interview. So they each sent an X. These guys had ""finished up"" their interview hours ago and had decided to just keep drinking and shooting the breeze with other X. They then decided ""screw it"" and went ahead and interviewed me whilst they were suitably toasted....

I got the job. I try not to think it was because they were drunk. They've never told me if I was the guy they were expecting or not..... 

EDIT for confusion: Company A hires Company B, a recruiting company, to find it candidates for a job. ""A"" goes over resumes sent to it by ""B"" and (I was not privy to this because I wasn't there) does a phone call or email or something to B saying something like ""This X dude looks cool send him for interview @ pub at this time"". Two different people in Company B get CC'd or hear this or get told this or wtfe, and they each send a candidate named X to the same interview being conducted by Company A."

Edit: To balance out my 'promotion' of a Dupont product, let me tell you a secret they don't want people to know:

DuPont loves to brag about their exceptional safety standards, but what they don't tell you is that they purposefully maintain their standards at an onerous level so that they can use their army of lobbyists to lobby government officials to push regulations so high that their competitors can't meet them and go out of business.

Also, when DuPont patents expire they immediately turn around and reveal health and environmental issues with their previous product and lobby the government to heavily regulate and/or outlaw it, allowing them to introduce a new product that does the same thing to maintain their stranglehold on a product segment."

So how do you get snails off an island, hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum, and hinged the lid. Then we wired aquatic plants to the lid as bait. The snails come for the flora, and... [imitates mollusk scuttering.] They fall into the drum, and after a month, you've trapped all the snails. But what did you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it. And they begin to get hungry, then one by one... [imitates snail munching sound.] They start eating each other, until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what - do you kill them? No. You take them, and release them into the sewers.

"Was watching a psych patient, pt was also high on pcp (work in an ER) Now idk if you've ever seen someone on pcp but it gives them hulk strength and that mixed with schizo/bipolar is a bad combo. She was probably about 260lbs and looking for a fight. Came out of her room and pushed me back before I could fully get up out of my chair. Pulled the switch under my desk aaaannnddd... Nothing. My heart sank, it was a very busy day and I knew no one would check in on me for a bit longer. Yelled out for help but no one heard. That's when I realized I was fucked. Im not a fan of going hands on but your really can't deescalate a pt that far gone. Luckily as I was pushed up against a wall and pushing back, my vocera(like a radio, but is voice activated and has a hard time recognizing commands when theres screaming in the backroind) went off with another nurse calling me. He heard what was going on over the vocera and rushed in. We restrained her and thats when I realized to never let your guard down for a second. got a good lesson that day, no matter how long your in this field you will always be reminded to never let your guard down.

"I wasn't so lucky.... Never thought the ""swift kick to the balls"" thing would apply to me till I was crying in pain at a professor's desk. "
"Chiming in.  This. Stuff. Is. The. SHIT.  

I dealt with a roach infestation at an apartment that was being professionally treated with boric acid twice a month and didn't even put a dent in it.  I moved to my new place and apparently brought some along in my toaster and coffee maker.  After a couple months, my new place is completely infested again.  I heard about this stuff and gave it a shot.  Within a week I completely stopped seeing roaches.  Apparently it's super duper potent and sticky.  It also takes about 24 hours to actually do its job.  So a roach is attracted to the peanut butter smell, climbs all over it and gets some stuck to itself.  Then it goes back to wherever the other roaches are congregating.  It climbs all over it's little friends and gets this stuff on them too.  Then they all die.  It's a roach holocaust and you're a successful version of Hitler."

"you're comparing an emergency alarm trigger [for instance, fire] with that of a security distress signal [for instance, gunmen].

The former are intended to be easily and readily spotted and activated.  The latter are neither intended to be easily activated, nor spotted.

Hell yes. A trick any broke college freshman has learned.

I've thrown many a party in the south and that's exactly what would happen.
"I'd like to point out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LingerieXCum/comments/6yxspq/yaarrr_maties_this_be_yer_captain_speakin/) post OP made five days ago.

It really corroborates his gay pirate fantasies.

Also, if you glance through the rest of OP's post history, you'll find that he is indeed an idiot capable of a fuckup like this."
Shit! HE FOUND US! QUICK! SCATTER!
"Cubicle environment. Loud &amp; nasty.

"How do they survive in such places? Anyways if you have a PC you can play PS2 games on it with your PS2 gamepad by downloading - PCSX 2.

It emulates the PS2 in Windows, and works very accurately.

"I work at a large bookseller. I see old couples come in, the little old wife and the little old husband are buying a bible or a book about the pope. The old men come in by themselves, they buy Penthouse. I'll bet only one of your grandparents was genuinely mad. "
"In all seriousness. I found that the best thing for a burn is honey. I absentmindedly grabbed a cookie sheet straight out of the oven with the hand that didn't have an oven mitt on it. It was some pretty excruciating pain. I held my hand in some honey and by the next morning it felt a million times better. 

Edit: I should add that I used the honey after keeping my hand in ice water for more than an hour. When the pain wouldn't subside, a quick Google search recommended honey. The pain started to subside and I fell asleep with my hand in honey. I woke up with honey all over my bed and hair. I couldn't be too mad since my hand didn't hurt so much anymore. "

"Not gonna lie, I thought this would end with you falling out the window because you masturbated too hard.

Edit: My top comment on Reddit is about me assuming someone fell out of a window while caressing their manhood. And my mom says I've never accomplished anything in my life."
It's all so tinderising.
Disagree that was hilarious

"We saw each other off and on for about 7 years. A few days after I finally fucked her (on her mother's bed), I dumped her for good.

I do have a serious WTF story about the two of us, but I have to figure out if it counts as a TIFU. "

"Your story is inconsistent.

Edit: chill

Likewise. Jumped the shark there. 
"Listen, bud, a piece of advice. I don't want to scare you, but as a teacher, don't ever post any kind of shit like this on social media. I don't know what age kids you're teaching but if they're older than about 6, you might get one who is on reddit sometimes. You might get one who sees this. You might get someone who connects the dots and sees that their student teacher is on reddit. And reads through their post history.

Now, a kid telling another kid at school that so and so posted about the alarm on reddit is one thing - if the principal overhears you would for sure be in deep shit.

A kid thinking it would be a laugh to print out your post history, no matter how seemingly harmless you might think your posts are - that would be bad for you at school.

Just don't post about stuff that people can identify you by. Seriously."
But he might get the chance to see the pearly gates which may or not be gilded.
