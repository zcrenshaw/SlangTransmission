They're talking to you. People put those words on things for you."
"Hilarious, but just want to point out how odd it is that OP feels awkward masturbating in private in a family home, but no problems walking around the mall doing this. The latter seems waaaay more extreme."

This whole story feels like a catfish. I just can't quite figure out the angle.
Came here expecting some good ass hair scratching with the bristles of a comb...Was met with soapy sodomy. The internet wins again.
No but her bulb is sore

Does your husband know you got wet at another mans house and left in his clothes?
"So you won‚Äôt masturbate in the privacy of a bedroom in somebody else‚Äôs house, but you‚Äôll do it while walking around the mall???"
I thought you were going to find the dog at the other end of the kiss.
I can't stop laughing at this.  I'm glad your cat is okay. :) 
Oh god. I'm going to be sick
When the dad got involved and didn't tell them all to stop and get the proper tools I got really disappointed. 
you were probably already on the chopping block and this was just an easier way of going about your removal.

Well at least you got a /r/tifu story out of it. 
Oooh yeah that. Usually your credit card company cares about these things more than the merchant. Def go to your card company and get the whole thing refunded. You didn‚Äôt get the service they said they were giving you.

Think the main question I have is whose comb was it??  Seemed weird you just had a random comb show up in your shower without it being someone elses...
"My daughter demands wrap songs before bed, and makes my wife sings them.  Once I put rap on the radio to see if that would calm her, she screamed that's not rap.

The vibration from Pokemon Go Plus are weak so unless they are extremely sensitive, I don't buy it. Even my lady parts need more action before it works. 

And if something broke into a clitoris (which I am assuming is their code for ""just the right place""), you aren't just pulling out a shard and slapping Neosporin. You're fuckin' screaming in pain. That's like a shard in your dick hole. And no girl is dumb enough to put a Band-Aid on a clitoris (we know from personal experience when the glue on back of menstrual pads get bent backwards and stick to us and nobody chooses that life again). 

Yeah, this sounds like a guy who doesn't know how female anatomy works. "
"Greyhound is alright as long *as you understand what you're getting into*. Yes, you're saving a lot of money, but the trade-offs:

1. Don't count on being at your destination on time. Greyhound is just too unreliable
2. The bus will stink. It always does. Sit closer to the front away from the toilet.
3. There is always a crying child. Always. Bring earplugs
4. Keep your valuables on your person. There are a lot of shady people riding Greyhound. "

"Greyhound is the epitome of a shithole company with no intentions to change. Was at college in Burlington, Vermont a few years back, semester had just ended and was at the bus stop waiting for the Greyhound bus with a few friends. About 30 people total were there. The bus was scheduled to come down from Montreal and arrive maybe 10 minutes late at most. Wasnt a huge deal. Until 10 minutes turned into 6 hours. Thankfully after the 20 minute mark a Papa Johns just down the street had opened its doors for us to wait so we wouldnt be in the below-freezing weather. Called up Greyhound and they gave zero reasons for being that late and just said another bus was on its way and hung up on me before I could ask when or where it was coming from.

On the 7th hour, the second bus finally arrives. But with 2 fucking seats open. Keep in mind these buses are like 20 years old, musty, and constantly breaking down. A Concord driver saw all the commontion as he was stopping (was a dual-company stop). It was a two-floor bus, all shiny and new, and about half of each floor was open. Well he decided to blast Greyhound on the spot for being a shit company, he offered free trips for everyone that was still waiting (everyone was going to Boston anyway). Called Greyhound to see if I could get a refund, they denied it, so I forced a refund request from my account, the request was accepted in a day. Called Concord just to thank them and praise the driver (got his name after we stopped). Turns out he got a raise and everyone on our trip was offered free trips to/from any destination. I, along with my friends, only rode Concord from then on, still remains my priority company any time I need to take a bus somewhere.

Fuck Greyhound and everyone asscociated with it."
Yeah get on it now. You could also lose your gf 
"Did something similar a few years ago.  Was convinced I could see the contact slid to the side of my eye.  Got out the tweezers and proceeded to work on it for a good 15 minutes.  My favorite part (also partly what convinced me I was ""close to getting it"") was the popping sound my eyeball made."

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt masturbated for two weeks bc I‚Äôm too shy as a guest, even when everybody is out of the house, but I‚Äôll comfortably walk around a mall with a makeshift vibrator.

‚ÄúCoincidentally, I choose to fly without underwear due to the oft-occurring problem of getting a wedgie on a plane, and I need to go directly from the plane to buy a Secret Santa gift at a mall that, as it happens, is a Pok√©mon hotspot.  

‚ÄúAlso, I don‚Äôt understand that even with skinny jeans, unless there are underwear or something to keep a mini vibrator in place, walking around would eventually dislodge the Pok√©mon toy until it was sticking out from my inner thigh like a tumor.

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you know it, I somehow managed to fall really hard right between my legs directly on my clitoris, hard enough to shatter plastic, at just the right angle, to create a shard that pierces my skin.

‚ÄúI go to the doctor and they don‚Äôt check out my supposedly lacerated genitals, I‚Äôll just take care of that at home with Neosporin.  And a band aid.  On my genitals.  (I guess I must have shaved or waxed while on my vacation, otherwise how would I stick a bandaid to my genitals? 

‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm just a cute little horny girl gamer who‚Äôs at home all alone frustrated, ignoring all of the comments that call out my pathetic post for the bullshit that it is.  Haters will say I‚Äôm making this up!!!‚Äù"

"Well, now they you lost your job, what shitty company was it?"
Holy shit
"I've taken the ol' Dirty Dog from Pennsylvania to Utah and back, then from PA to San Diego and back. Each trip lasted more than three days. Some of the memories include
* Witnessing a heroin arrest while laid over in Denver
* Picking up a drunk passenger in Effingham who became progressively more drunk until kicked off in Denver. He said he was going to Vegas to meet his girlfriend, then said his wife left him for his brother and took the dog, then claimed he had no idea where he was from. Ended up having a one-sided conversation with his brother on an imaginary phone, taking a swing at him, collapsing to the ground, then rolling around laughing and asking the driver if he liked girls with pink panties. The driver had an eerily calm and distant voice and said ""Everyone just caaalm down"" repeatedly
* Having the bus break down in Eagle's Pass CO. I went to a pizza place with a black dude going to a bachelor party in Vegas  (he paid our $200+ bill), a woman from Haiti, and a three-hundred-pound female bounty hunter. Saw my first-ever raven. Got super drunk, returned to the bus, and proceeded to play a game with the assembled. Everybody had to make a racist joke but it couldn't be about your own race. Hilarious, then we got back on the bus and passed the fuck out.
* Watched a non-stop lighting storm while passing through Kansas
* Made friends with a pretty blonde who shared her vodka and I shared my Copenhagen (seriously, this chick was freaking awesome)
* Saw my first-ever cross dresser. They seemed really skeevy and dirty, probably fucked up on opiates. They fell getting off the bus once and I admit I didn't put my hand out to help. Some other dude did and I give him mad props.
* Helped this young kid who was smuggling a pit bull puppy to his friend's house. He was coming from a town with a no-pit-bull rule and wanted to save its life. We all took turns hiding the dog from the driver and such. He carried it to the bathroom where it peed and probably pooped.
* Met a guy going to Vegas who I think tried to get me back to his house to drug me or rape me or something. He offered a wad of cash to play the slots with him and suggested I get a few drinks and spend the night at his place. Really weird dude, caught him in a big lie about his time in the Navy.
* Taught a guy how to make a minnow trap out of a plastic 2-liter bottle of soda. He was sincerely grateful, took two months off of work to go fishing.
* Got a handjob from a girl going to Kansas. She was headed home from New York because her dad died and she needed to take care of his estate.
* Said goodbye to my then-girlfriend and got on the bus. The driver looked at me and said, ""She's a pretty girl, you sure you wanna go?"" Minor thing but it sticks out in my memory.
* Watched a few meteors at night in Montana during a meteor shower through the bus window with that pretty blonde snuggled up against me. We both agreed it was too uncomfortable to avoid touching each other so we had a nice 23-hour relationship. She didn't give me the handy.
* Saw a boat abandoned on the side of the road in the desert somewhere.

A lot of Greyhound sucks and is a bad, bad time, but I fucking loved the experience and recommend anybody with a sense of adventure and a taste for rough traveling give it a shot."
I tried explaining that to my wife... She's now pissed that I even have those songs on my main playlist to begin with and wondering why anybody would listen to those songs more than once.
The skinny jeans no panties thing was fishy as is...
"Yeah... the fuckup here isn‚Äôt really your going in for the kiss, it‚Äôs having an aggressive dog in your house. üòï

"Yeah, I mean I guess I didn‚Äôt really think of it as masturbating as I was doing it."
Yep honestly I don‚Äôt believe it. Even reading it sounds like it‚Äôs a made up story.

"Work in a police dispatch center. Greyhound stopped at a station, driver got off told all the passengers to fuck themselves then left. 3 hours later he had not returned. They called the company, who said a new driver would be there soon.

"Adults don't know everything. You've learned a VERY valuable lesson. If you think there's something wrong then take care of it. Your doctor doesn't listen? Get a second opinion. Doctors don't know everything either.

I had a cough for a while once and one day I heard a crackling when I exhaled. I remember this being a bad sign, but didn't know where I had heard it. I mentioned it in passing to my mom and she said, ""Oh, that's nothing"". I went to the doctor anyway. He sent me for X-rays and sent me home with an antibiotic. The next day he calls me at work and tells me I need to go home and rest immediately. No work, no nothing. It turns out I had pneumonia in one lung. Normally you feel lousy with pneumonia, but since my other lung was functioning fine I didn't feel anything aside from the cough. What this meant, though, is that my other lung could never recover as long as I was leading a normal life since the lung needed to rest.

Don't let other people's opinions override yours when it comes to your health. You have to live with the consequences, not them."

That being said, if one of my students were to do something like this, I wouldn't hold it against them.  God knows I remember that hormone-addled craze.

I'm sure that teacher doesn't hold it against you either."
"hahahahahahahahahaha I‚Äôm sorry for your pain, but this was fucking hilarious. Thank you for sharing! "
"Yes, I would highly recommend you do this. Also, very rarely do companies fight chargebacks. I‚Äôd also recommend contacting their customer service department and speaking with a supervisor, in addition to leaving some detailed reviews online. "
"Ok, so I play a lot of pokemon go and I also use a Pokemon Go Plus

OP's story is fucking bullshit. In order to catch something using a Plus, you have to press the button. Every time. If there's a pokemon or stop nearby nearby, it buzzes like three times, then **you have to press the button to initiate the catch**. If you don't press the button, it assumes you don't want to use the Plus anymore and will automatically disconnect after awhile. There's no way it was going off constantly, even with a fuck ton of pokestops nearby. OP would have to hit the button after it buzzed for every pokemon and pokestop she encountered or it would have shut off. I find it hard to believe she'd be punching her crotch every 5 seconds to press the button.

The aftermarket Plus (called the Go-tcha) has an auto-catch feature, but she specifically mentions that this is a Plus and even mentions that you press the button."
If you punch your girlfriend at exactly 11:59:45 you'll start your new years off right.
"As a person who works at a gas station in SD where the greyhound gets let out.. Bless you. Every night at 9:00 I have to brace myself for whoever is going to walk in. I work alone at the sketchiest gas station in town. Some passengers have cool stories, most just harass me about not taking EBT, buy smokes, desimate the bathroom, gamble, and leave. I only pray that they make it back on the bus in 15 min when it leaves. Some don't. I help the bus driver look sometimes but usually they'll just leave with all the passengers things. Always wondered what would happen to them. Pretty unbearable with this -6¬∞ hit we'll take tonight. I hope you get the compensation you deserve, sorry you missed Christmas."
"&gt; whose comb was it??

Why is this comment so far down? Everyone's talking about how weird it is to stick a comb up your arse, but nobody is wondering about OP using a comb he didn't buy. Even in your hair would be a no-no."
"After being constantly hounded by my wife for photo-ops, my daughter now sees the phone pointed at her and just shuts down any chances of ""cute"". We have to be sneaky now if we want to give relatives any decent photos. "
Kindergarten Robocop: the crossover movie you never knew you needed.
Just another one of the many red flags on this bullshit story.

Now that I think about it, it's the only good sub on Reddit."

"Uh, the fact that your sister screamed AGAIN when you woke her up without the mask, in front of the sheriff, makes it so much funnier and way more on her than you at that point. "
"Yeah, I'm sure you grabbed the ""scalding"" pocket pussy and didn't hesitate when it started burning your hand before shoving your dick in it.

Yeah. For sure. "
"""And how did injury occur?""

""I shoved a beer pong ball up my ass""

""Alright fair enough""

VS.

""And how did this injury occur?""

""I...swallowed it""

""You fucking moron, that wouldn't have cleared your throat you lying dickhead, and within an hour, that's not a bowel movement, that's a bowel sprint"" "
"If it makes you feel any better, your entire family had faith in you that the disk was in the Xbox one to begin with. 

And no one doubted you.

They will now. Forever. With good cause."
