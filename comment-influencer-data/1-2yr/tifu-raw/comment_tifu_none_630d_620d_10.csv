"I'm really sorry dude. 20 years later, your email addy becomes your identity. If it helps, it reads like you did as much homework as you could so this isn't a careless or unthinking TIFU so much as an unintended-consequences TIFU. Those are easier to swallow as time passes, believe me.

My suggestion: help him get the word out that ""due to technical difficulties, Business-X no longer has access to a specific email"". Sit down with him and review his customer list, put together a reach-out correspondence involving his new email, and sent from his new email. Get him to browse any paperwork or electronic files he has besides email to help uncover his history of business. And use a spreadsheet to make an alphabetical list of contacts so you're creating a database of sorts if he doesn't already have one.

If he's not comfortable doing this with you, suggest it for him to do himself or working with someone else as a course of action. 

And do NOT state in any mass correspondence that all email history has been lost! This could open up opportunities for customers to unfairly demand refunds or something because there's no longer an audit trail."

He said he'd try to resolve that issue tomorrow and that he will let me know if I can help at all.

In an alternate universe: ‚ÄúTIFU by laying my eggs inside what I thought was a hollowed out log‚Äù
"I know you may not want advice and probably figured it out for yourself. I‚Äôm going to say it anyway. Never buy a pet without talking to the people who will be living with it. Easing someone into it provides time to get used to the idea and builds the excitement leading to the day you bring the new family member home. I suspect that the biggest reason for your parents reaction was that it sprung on them with no warning. You were probably expecting them to love the dog at first sight and that didn‚Äôt happen. Everyone grieves on their own time. After losing my service dog suddenly it took me years before I even contemplating getting a new partner. My mother who was actually more attached to poor Jesse than I was (and Jesse to her honestly) only took months before she was ready. (By that time I had moved out.)

Now all of that being said I think your father‚Äôs reaction was harsh. Even if he refused the dog he should have had enough compassion to let you find a new home for it. He was wrong not to do so."

"This is a funny story, but I'd just like to say that you made the right move in getting it checked out right away.

I recently noticed what I was pretty sure was blood in my stool, but it was easy to dismiss it as a one-off occurrence and that it probably didn't mean anything serious. I thought, ""Maybe it's not blood. It might just be something that I ate that looks that way or something.""

Fast forward a couple weeks and I see the same thing; what basically looked like a clot in my stool. I knew it would be a little embarrassing to talk about, but I figured I should just bite the bullet and get it checked out by my doctor. It actually was extremely easy to talk about once we started the conversation, and they gave me a take home test that was easy and not invasive at all. Took it back to the doctor and, sure enough, the test came back positive for blood in my stool.

I was scheduled for a colonoscopy, which again might sound scary, but was actually an extremely easy, painless experience that was over in an hour. The colonoscopy revealed four polyps, two of which were precancerous. They were safely removed and I haven't had any issues since. I'll have to go back next year for another colonoscopy to make sure I don't have any new polyps or issues, but I consider myself extremely fortunate. If I had dismissed my symptoms and/or waited any longer, who knows how badly things could have progressed.

I'm a healthy male in my late 20s, so know that this kind of thing can happen to anyone. If you notice any symptoms like this at all, just bite the bullet and get it checked out. You've got nothing to lose and potentially everything to gain.

Again, thanks for sharing, and I'm so glad you didn't actually have any serious issues. Happy Holidays!"

"A few years ago, my son, who was around three at the time, was on my shoulders as we walked towards the bus stop.  Then we saw the bus coming in and instinctively, we ran towards the bus stop and got there just in time.

"Ex-gf's a therapist. One night way back then I pulled the blanket up except she'd got her feet wrapped around the bottom somehow, trapping it. Hand slipped off the blanket, arm flails back, elbowed her right in her face. Terrific black eye. Nasty.

Of course this was the night before she was running a group therapy/counselling session (idk what, not my area of expertise) with domestic violence escapees and she's got to walk in there looking just like she's been slapped around by an abusive partner and legit all she can say to any question is ""Oh, it was just an accident. My bf's nice. He'd never do anything to hurt me. His hand slipped. It was my fault for trapping the blanket."" I'm sure they'd all have believed her, right? Yeah. Right. Not at all professional.

As of right now, I am friends with almost the entire vfd and the pd where I live and go to college, so they know to give me more time, and to help me to a bed to sleep it off rather than send me somewhere to sleep and get charged for it. Bill collectors call all the fucking time.

They love me and I have just spent the night putting toys together. Forgiveness is swift. 
the last sentence is the edgyest shit i've ever read
I can only imagine your wife explaining it to her friends and colleagues
"I got into an argument while out for dinner one night with my (now) ex, and basically just got up and left.  I walked home and, tried to calm down by playing some wii tennis.  While I was playing, I went to hit the ball, and instead smashed my hand into the glass chandelier.  

Blood EVERYWHERE...like lots of blood.  I called a cab to take me to the hospital, wrapped my finger up with packing tape (it was all I had) and almost passed out in the back seat from loss of blood.  

I got home hours later, and my gf was sitting in the living room crying.  She came over after I left to apologize, saw all the blood everywhere and had no idea what had happened.  I didn't have my phone with me, so she had no idea what was going on.  Freaked her the hell out.  

I still have the scar...and that's seriously a pretty fitting way to remember my relationship with her."

Talked my parents into giving my sister (charcoal) coal when she was a teen. Sis made a basket to put it in to display &amp; brag to her friends how she got coal in her stocking.
"Pretty irresponsible thing to do. 

That animal is a living thing, not an object. Hundreds of animals end up in shelters around holidays for exactly this reason.

‚ÄúShe told me what they were‚Äù
"This story has, like, four separate climaxes. What a rollercoaster. "
"&gt;slowly sank to the floor bawling in disbelief&gt;

This had me dying laughing. That level of drama is all too real. I used to be a camp counselor for kids aged 5-12 and good god do children know how to be dramatic.

"You know, if you believe there‚Äôs any sort of existential cosmic ‚Äúplan‚Äù or ‚Äúinterconnection‚Äù to everything, you could surmise that the totality of events that lead your father to find and acquire that didgeridoo, bring it home, have your curiosity piqued over *years* of walking by it paying it no mind all were set in motion so the universe could ultimately ejaculate spiders down your throat.

I grew up with wood and coal stoves/fireplaces. The idea that anyone thinks a chunk of coal is unique just gave me a mild shiver of culture shock.
When i was little i bit my grandma in the ankle. she thought i was a wasp and hit me as hard as she could.
Owning a husky is a big responsibility. It's a breed that requires vigorous exercise to be happy and healthy. On top of that you bought a full grown dog which would require a lot of extra work to adapt it to a new owners lifestyle. You fucked up but I think your heart was in the right place. I don't think his response was normal at all. I think there might be more to the story you might not be telling us.
" My parents, dad especially,  used to tell me all sorts of stuff.  Like being A DIRECT descendant of both Christopher Columbus and Julius Caesar.  So,  when a kid at school said that wasn't true,  I punched him,  and my parents had to try to keep straight faces in the ensuing parent teacher conference....

"My mum grew up on the same street as Rolf Harris (you know, the convicted pedo) she was working as a travel agent and the company she worked for had a competition where you had to bring the most Australian thing you could to the airport in order to win a trip to Australia. Being neighbours with Rolf Harris she went to his house and politely asked him if she could borrow something for his, he let her borrow his didgeridoo. She brought it to the airport and of course many people didn‚Äôt believe her that it was his, however she did still make it to Australia.

And that‚Äôs the story of how my aunt has held Rolf Harris‚Äôs didgeridoo. (She didn‚Äôt get molested however)"

"No it‚Äôs alright, I get it, it‚Äôs why I posted here. I did it because I figured that when I was told not do exchange $2500 in cash, that it shouldn‚Äôt stop me from exchanging for something less than it, like say $1000"
"Don't worry, I totally almost did the same thing once. Guy hands me ¬£1000 in 20s and says he wants them in 10s, I count them and give him the 10s, count them out in front of him he takes and looks confused and says no, I wanted euros and hands them back. I say the rate of the euros and the guy then says no it's too high. Just as I was about to give his money back a colleague says, count the money he handed back. The fucker took nearly half of the bundle of 10s I gave him. The look on his face was priceless when I counted them and he hastily put the rest back in the tray. "
"Right up there with recognizing some of the finer forms of wit, including sarcasm and passive aggressive jokes."
"I don't believe you, but that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard if this is true.  Why would you do that?  Again, I don't believe you."
Take this as an opportunity to set him up with a real domain and email host (office365 or g-suite). It won't fix the past but should look more professional to new customers and there will be a lot less chance of something like this happening again.
"When my daughter was around 5, she liked to play this game where she snuck up on me and scared me. I had put her to bed one night and went to my bedroom to fold some laundry and watch some tv, when I heard a noise. We lived alone, so my guard was up, so to speak. I got up and crept down the dark hallway to check the door, when she jumped out of the corner to scare me. I panicked, instincts took over before my brain could make sense of it, and I raised my arm and basically karate chopped her in the neck. She was stunned, then crying, then I was crying and freaking out thinking I crushed her little windpipe, it was madness. She was fine, not even a bruise, thankfully. I still feel terrible everytime I think about her little face looking at me like, 'Why, Mommy?' It was over 7 years ago. "
