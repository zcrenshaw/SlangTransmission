This is why feedback from colleagues is important...
I honestly don't understand why any parent ever just barges in on their kids when the door is closed (unless they are a small child). That just seems like they're asking to see something they don't want to.
"I feel like no, but there is really no way to know without a true peer reviewed study. We will need multiple children, and some very questionable consent forms. "
I kept having to remind myself you couldn't have possibly gotten murdered because you had to be alive to write this up.
"Ouch... I suggest you stop talking to her. It's one of the best ways to get over unreciprocated feelings. Best of luck, OP. "
"I'm a real estate guy, done flips, manage properties. 

Someone broke several laws, and you have a payday coming.

If a bathroom was added unpermitted, it's an issue. 

If a bathroom was added permitted and the city permitting guys didn't check something basic like this, it's a problem.

I know hundreds of flippers, I can't see a single one doing this. But there are bad ones out there.

It's possible they bought it not knowing too, though from your description it sounds like the flipper added it. But if they bought it with the problem, they are also victims.

Essentially, whoever did the original and then didn't finish it and disclose it is going to be turning that shit into gold for you, and not of the reddit variety."
"Dude youre lucky thats all that happened.

I had a chick facebook message me wanting to smoke some green and fuck. I had maybe a hitters worth left and thats all. She wanted me to park on a certain part of the road near a local park. She was out there waiting and told me she wanted to walk through the back door of her house so her family doesnt notice. As we got to the back of her house two dudes jumped out and beat the shit out of me. One of them had me in a stranglehold and demanded I take everything out of my pockets. They stole my wallet, phone, keys, and the little bit of weed I had on me. One dude said if I ever talked to his girlfriend again hed kill me. They then beat me some more and all ran off. 

Had the neighbors call the cops and few weeks later I managed to recognize her and her boyfriend at my work. Picked him out of a lineup and he got charged for felony theft. Got some jailtime and had to pay me $1,200 for everything they stole.

The girl didnt get in any trouble at all even afer showing them the facebook messages of her trying to sell me cocaine and heroin."
"The least you could do is to trash her phone number, sign her up for every sweepstakes entry you can find. fill out car and health insurance quotes just for fun and lastly get a friend to call her and pretend they are from the department of health tell her she needs to come in because someone she has been with has tested positive don't say for what let her go down and test for everything and wait weeks for the results "
"Just had an emergency vet visit with our dog who acted the very same way as Leo. The vet tech right off the bat thought he had eaten some weed and was so convinced that she even convinced my partner also. Granted I don’t partake any of that, but when she left the room my partner started asking if I have any drugs in the house and it was ok if I did. Wish it was weed, but our little guy had a stroke. He’s all good now, just with old age. However I guess they have the same symptoms as being high as having stroke. "

"Computer: ""Retire or delete this phone configuration?""

Your script: ""Yes.""

**EDIT** After the OP deleted the post someone asked me to put it in this (top, thanks all) comment.

*TLDR; Computer support engineer for a device management company modifies a script to try and save time, ends up bricking 20,000 client smartphones, amazingly doesn't get fired.*

&gt;This FU just happened this morning, I'm  sitting at my desk waiting for my boss to call me into his office. I  work at a company that runs an MDM service for customers. For those who  don't know what an MDM is, we manage our customers mobile devices, PC,  etc using 3rd party services like AirWatch, Mobile Iron.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm a support engineer and it's my job to help customers when they call with issues, give them steps to resolve problems, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;So  here comes the FU. I got an emergency call last night from a customer  who said none of their devices could get access to their corporate data.  They have 20000 iPhones and Android devices. Something on the backend  was broken and the device records in the service were broken.  
&gt;  
&gt;I  spoke to my developer, and he asked me to reproduce the customer's  configuration and see if I could reproduce the problem. Sure enough, a  few hours later I had on my test environment.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  dev did some more investigation and had spoken to the MDM vendor on the  phone and they told him to test out a script that would delete the  device record but once the device checked back in it would recreate  itself in the service and everything would be fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;He  gave me the script to test and I ran it on my account and everything  worked fine, except one little thing, the script prompted you every time  you deleted a device record and asked if you wanted to delete or retire  the device. After 20 seconds the script would automatically choose  “Delete”. Now deleting is fine, because when the device checks back in,  it gets recreated. Retiring is bad, because it unmanages the devices.  
&gt;  
&gt;So  me being a smart guy I figured I could modify the script to enter  delete every 3 seconds. I tested it out a couple times and it seemed to  work ok on my test account with a few devices.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  customer said it was ok to run on their account and my dev also  approved (without knowing I had modified it to run faster so I could  save myself sometime.)  
&gt;  
&gt;I take the script  and kick it off, it's going great. Plowed through about 200 devices when  the script goes haywire, throwing errors all over the place.  
&gt;  
&gt;I tried to close it out but my computer was acting up and it wouldn't close. I finally just unplugged the computer.  
&gt;  
&gt;After  I booted back up I loaded the customer's account and found it had run  19590 device retire requests. I couldn't breathe. I called my dev and  explained what happened and asked him what we could do. He replies ""Get  your resume ready, that's about it"".  
&gt;  
&gt;So  as I sit at my desk, probably for the last time I'm pondering how I  could be so stupid. The customer has 20000 devices that cannot access  email or corporate data without completely re-enrolling every device.  
&gt;  
&gt;TL;DR - Tried to save myself some time helping a customer and completely obliterated all their phones. Probably getting fired.  
&gt;  
&gt;UPDATE:  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok  I just got out of the meeting. I'm not fired. (THANK GOD). The DEV  saved my ass, told the bosses he wasn't clear about usage for the script  and should've been explicit with me how to use it and not to modify it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But, guess who gets to fly around the country and help this company's IT fix phones for the next month? ME!  
&gt;  
&gt;So  while my job is safe (for now) my wife is going to fucking kill me. We  have summer plans, vacation, all this shit now has to be cancelled. My  bosses made it very clear if I wasn't able to travel to help the  customer I might as well just resign.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I'm packing my bags soon and I'll be on the West Coast on Thursday after the holiday."

"Well, ok. How much of $0 do you think is fair? "
"“Come somewhere else” sounds more inviting, albeit a little sexual."
"I just got here.....

and WTF. Is this a reality comedy show?"
"This is exactly it. As a woman, I’m really pissed off on behalf of op and it brings back memories of all the times I’ve seen women take advantage of a guy who is obviously interested in them, only to take that free drink, free ride to/from another date, free meal, etc., and with the same breath, bitch about how guys take advantage of them and are creeps, etc. 

It’s bullshit. Men have feelings, worries and insecurities just the same as women do and if you’re taking advantage of that, you’re an asshole. 

I had a friend that I was pretty close with for a few years, ‘besties,’ if you will, and she would do this shit all the time.  I talked to her about how I felt and why. I tried to understand her side by asking why, but I never got a decent response that wasn’t brushing me off to change the subject.

One night at a bar, we were both waiting to order our drinks when a guy approached my friend and asked if he could buy her a drink. She looked at me and I gave her the nod, implying that I was cool with her sitting with him to chat for a bit or to invite him to our table where my husband and a few other friends were waiting. 

She accepted his offer and when he handed her the drink, she thanked him and then walked away. Unsure, the guy followed her to our table until she turned around and said, “NO. Stop following me!” She said it loudly as if the guy was harassing her and there were many inebriated white knights around us ready to spring into action to her defense, and so the poor guy walked away momentarily stunned and completely embarrassed,  defeated and probably a little scared to get his ass kicked.  My husband and our friends were confused for a moment. 

I was pissed. I told her off and after talking to my husband briefly, I walked away to find the guy, hoping he hadn’t left yet. He was with a large group of his buddies but when I found him, I noticed he was sitting slightly apart from them, disengaged and quietly sipping his beer.  

I went back to the bar, ordered a drink and approached his table. I was afraid for a moment that he was going to tell me off until I handed him the drink and said, “I’m sorry that my friend was an asshole to you back there. I know I’m not the girl you wanted to hang out with and I am happily married, but you seem like a nice guy and so I bought you this drink hoping to make amends. May I sit with you and chat for a bit?”

He accepted and we hung out for the rest of the night, my husband joining us about 20 minutes later. We laughed so hard and had a great time and I hope I was able to ever so slightly take away the sting of my friend’s disrespectful and rude behavior. 

My friend and I parted ways after that.

Ladies, please don’t treat men like pieces of shit. Not all of them are focused on only sex and it’s really hard to be expected to make the first move most times when searching for companionship. Put yourself in their shoes and imagine the nerve it takes to approach a stranger you’re attracted to, hoping to have a chance to get to know them. Imagine how you would like to be turned down gently if the shoe were on the other foot. What my friend did that night was the equivalent of, “HAHAHA! Loser!”  Don’t be that girl. 

If it’s not obvious, if a guy offers to buy you a drink for example, that’s his ‘opening line,’ before asking your name, etc. Be direct and polite if you’re not single or interested. Thank them for the offer, explain that you’re with someone and then DECLINE the drink graciously. Don’t accept the drink and then tell him because that makes you an asshole.

It’s ok to ask guys for favors but again, be direct about it. Be forthcoming that you’re asking a favor and bringing a friend or boyfriend and explain what your expectations are. Treat him like the human being he is. Don’t imply anything. Don’t lead him wondering or excited and then embarrass and disrespect him in the moment. You’d fucking ugly cry if someone did that to you. Have some empathy.

"One time a chick who had been googly-eyeing my husband from the dance floor at the dance hall for months followed him to the bathroom. When he came out she asked him if he was there with his girlfriend. “Well, she’s not really my girlfriend,” he said. (Since we were married it was technically true.) She handed him her phone number folded up on a piece of paper. 

On the way home, he confessed this whole thing to me and threw the paper out the window and we’ve joked about it ever since. We’ll be married 33 years next month, and it has never bothered me that he’s a bit of a flirt. However, had I been pregnant at the time, I’d have probably punched him in the throat. 

She will get over it in time. But yeah, you should probably get a minivan."

I know someone that normally is not a good hearted person (Doesn't give homeless a dollar, only looks out for himself, etc) still a very decent man, but did not reap his wealth from random good deeds from the kindness of his heart. 

He was driving through the city, it's pouring rain, like soaking (owns a private transport company, is picking up a client) and sees a young woman with nothing but a t shirt and skirt on or something. He's at the light, sees she's walking same way he's driving and asks if she wants a ride. 

He tells her he's going to 80th st, she through the traffic noise says something about 80th as well, but does not get in his car talking about needing her cell phone or something. Light turns green, cars are honking, he shrugs and drives off. 

Gets pulled over immediately for [edit:  soliciting] a prostitute, gets booked into a cell, tarnishing his perfect record,  bails himself out and has a terrible row with his wife over it.

My man!
"Huh. That's interesting. I've been struggling financially lately and haven't been taking very good care of my nutrition. I don't eat a lot of fruits and veggies, and have been experiencing rashes, sore gums, lethargy... Just googled scurvy after reading your post, and I think it might be safe to say I have it as well. Guess I'm gonna have to get some oranges or supplements or something."
A smooth criminal
Wow. I’m really sorry she treated you like that - completely unacceptable behavior. You didn’t fuck up; she’s a horrible human. 
"No. Not an Amazon gift card. A bottle of scotch. 

When a fellow human saves your life, you buy them a drink"
He’s 13 not 5. Have him stay with family and fly out 3 days later. 
"&gt;grab a sizable cup (ladies)

Lmao, this cracked me up. I appreciate your humor."
"Hell yeah. Getting robbed, and especially violently mugged is traumatic as fuck (been there, done that) so I'm sorry that happened to you, but I'm glad this story had a 'better' ending."
$3k and everything. 
"I guess the good news is your dog was high and not having a stroke. Could have been much worse. 

Also I wouldn’t feel too bad. He was sniffing your trash, it’s not like you left it out in the open for him to potentially eat. "
Unzips?

"""go somewhere different"" would've been a nice direction of saving his ass "
Word of advice: Do NOT suggest you name your baby Sarah.
"Lol, they are actually not that expensive where I'm from. I didn't go for the really expensive stuff and had six different items for under 100 euro and I was slightly drunk, because sober I wouldn't have bought them in the first place..."
"Absolutely. Then took advantage of OP's manners by acting like it was meant to be a photoshoot, trusting that he wouldn't want to get confrontational and call her out on her shit. It's a scummy move to do to a stranger, never mind when the person actually likes you - hope OP isn't too heartbroken because this girl is trash "
Was her name Sarah?
"Because they find most stuff.  We had an inspector, everything looked good until I started to renovate the basement a year later and found that the main beam for the house was eaten apart by termites.  No way an inspector was going to find that without ripping your drywall down.  But he saw that my attic fan wasn't working and that our house was still hooked half up to well water, both of which we were compensated for by the seller."
Take a wild guess
"I am gonna be SO CAREFUL from now on! I didn't even realize there were any left in there, one must have fallen out of the tin I kept them in and just hung around the bottom of the freezer until I cleaned it out."
"""we skimp on rent to pass the savings to you!"""
"Yeah, I'm back on my multivitamins but I figure if I'm dumb enough to let this happen, I  should probably see what else ive I've missed, lol. "
WE WERE ON A BREAK
Did you just try it?
Eat the food you stupid bitch
"Honestly this

If I was in his shoes, I wouldn't even comment on anything to her or David. She will make inevitable contact, OP then says yeah I have the photos done, they're *insert regular rate*, but since you're both ""friends"", I'll lower it for you guys.

OP she fucking used you because she knew you liked her. Get your revenge by fucking with her, and you might even make some money.

Girls like that have an ego, and she honestly might just pay so she doesn't feel like SHE was the one to get played.

GOOD LUCK"
"I mean, it's easier than self-diagnosing someone else."
"&gt; I am sure that she needs my $40 more than I do.

People need to stop with this. I have, unfortunately, been in the position to know some people like this in my younger days. They're just scumbags. Not down on their luck angels just trying to get by. Shitty people with no conscious and no remorse getting over on people they view as easy marks. 

There's always the odd exception but for the most part people like her and her friend are just predators."
This is evidence that OP is lucky to be alive. Sonic slushies are like a pregnant woman's nirvana. The fact that she sacrificed those perfect for chewing ice balls means she was seconds away from murdering the thing she loves most in this world and opted for the next thing she loves most at the last second. 
I could not agree more.
"Good luck man! Or, you could transfer the booking details and stuff to my name, I'd love to go to Portugal. 

I'll send you a postcard, I promise."
"I think Be Somewhere Else would have been a little better. Maybe try coming up with another slogan? Who knows, maybe the owners loved it? "
After posting them on r/photoshopbattles
"This is the best outcome you could have hoped for, you also have a chance to redeem yourself.

Big props to the DEV that did all he could to not get you fired, you owe him big time.

Also, dont write/modify a script to reactivate 20k phones - god knows they will catch fire when you are the one executing it."
"This is a good idea

Just tell her that you had the time to think about it yesterday after you got home. And that you felt uncomfortable, because you ended up being their driver and their photographer. That you can't give her the photos. But if she really wants the photos, she can pay for them.

By doing this, you wont end up looking like a complete fool and retrieve some of your dignity.

The girl is seems manipulative and hurtful to the point of not realizing it."
I was carrying my cat down the stairs of my apartment complex in her bag so we could go to the vet and the strap broke and she tumbled down a flight of stairs and I haven’t forgiven myself even though she’s 100% fine.
Photoshop your head on the guys body before you give her the pictures.
Uhh pretty fucked up they arrested you on that. Seems super wrong to come and arrest you the next morning based off of what a random girl said 
"Surely this bitch knew she was taking advantage of you. Don’t give her the photos.

At least you acted with dignity."
I'm not your girlfriend but my family is also like this. It drives me batshit since I'm very private and they want doors open or unlocked at all times. 
"Nah, take her out and shop yourself in. Stare deeply into his eyes. Make the pictures as uncomfortable as possible and post to facebook. "
"The original pic can be bought as a DLC for a mere $69.98 ~~($69.99)~~! Or she can unlock it in pieces by opening these $3 lootboxes, providing her a sense of pride and accomplishment. "

"Dude... DUUUUdeeee...

...makes me wonder how you'd feel finding out she pulled something like that on you..

Edit: nowhere did i say he cheated

Edit: itd be different if she wasnt 5 mos. Pregnant, miserable, in 100 degree heat taking care of their daughter. He had a bad stroke of luck, thats for damn sure, but he knew he was wrong. Yes, id be hurt. "
"“Fucking stupid” will suffice, I’m sure."

Believe it or not two bell peppers have twice the vitamin C as a single bell pepper.
"Hi everyone.  I'm glad everyone is enjoying this post.  Unfortunately, the comments have devolved primarily  into areas we really don't want to see here and this post has been locked.  Have a lovely day."
As a dev I would rather have an Amazon gift card lol
"[At least you didn't watch *Planet of the Apes* with no subtitles, listening to monkeys grunt for 2 hours.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/38ut4u/tifu_by_showing_my_dad_rise_of_the_planet_of_the/?st=jiy8znpg&amp;sh=6215e919)"
The funny part is the desk guys total lack of fucks. Lol
"My sister once left two STRONG brownies on the floor of her room..... my dog DEVOURED THEM. He promptly started pooing all over the place then fell unconscious. He ended up getting his stomach pumped and stayed a couple days, now he spazzes out sometimes but still 90% the old dog he used to be 

Edit: I hated my sister a long time for this lol"
Thanks! I'm currently staying with my parents for break so fruits and veggies abound. 
"Lol your username means ""robbed"" in Turkish. It checks out.

That's terrible about your uncle though. What a shitty thing to do."
A lot of parents to this. It's like they don't think their kids need an privacy. Hell mine don't even knock and just walk in anyway. 
"You mean “whoops the card got erased,” right? "
that's the last thing you wanna do is give the wife a cash incentive 
"You can get a payday out of most discrepancies in the contractual drawings. Its kind of a big issue in the industry currently, where you have firms buying up entire developments just so they can go thru them with a fine tooth comb to find what wasn't built to spec or code, then sue as many people as humanly possible.  Google construction defect lawsuits for more info on that.

This typically includes the site plan, arch, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural, civil, geological, and landscaping. All those drawings had to go through technical review with the city/county, and carry signature blocks of approval from the government engineers &amp; planners. If reality doesn't match what they signed off on, thats typically a big deal. "
What the heck haha *Go Somewhere Else* nice job 😂
This reads like the script for an episode of something starring Kevin James.

Dev is going to do everything in his power to make sure everyone knows it wasn’t his fault.
Am I the only one that thinks op acted inappropriate??
"Lol yes, I followed up with them. They’ll for sure tease me about this."
"This isn’t your fuck up, it’s your moms. She should have called home ahead to let you know she was bringing this woman to meet you, and she shouldn’t have opened the door to your bedroom with a stranger. She was totally out of line. "
"Now, your mother is still on the wrong with no social graces. She should prep you before you meet the person. Even a text saying she's coming home with a friend that would get you an internship."
"At a certain point in life you are given a set of choices, none of which you want but there’s no opting out. For me it was crawl through a swimming pool of human waste or give up and die in a swimming pool of human waste. I had no other options so I went with the choice that would allow me to tell a good story and laugh about it later. "
"No.  Not at all.  They would have had to worked with the air force to do this type of test where you light up a military plane. 

The Air Force would have planned a flight just for this type of test. Lighting up an unsuspecting pilot would be a big no no. "
What a nice girl 
"Joke's on them, you got a bunch of free drinks. Cool as a cucumber"
I agree that's a terrible name for a boy
"You wanna know the worst part? My other dog came down with a horrific, random and nearly fatal disease last month. As soon as she was home I bought pet insurance for all my animals. Checked it on Monday for Leo, doesn't kick in until 30 days after the purchase date. It had been 27 days."
"read this story out loud and my friends all agree while its not grounds for a divorce and to split a family, it's a nasty little seed of distrust that's going to take some patience, finesse and a lot of communication from OP to kill it."
