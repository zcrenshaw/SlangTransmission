"Ok. I wont talk about the tifu. But I have a great deal of experience rehabilitating and rehoming dogs that have been abused/neglected. 

First off good for you for providing a happy and safe home for your pup. Lets talk about ways to help your dog move past its fear of objects and strangers. Repetition. Its been trained to expect bad things under specific conditions. Raised hands. Objects lifted above. Probably doesnt like people standing/coming up behind them. Or even the presence of strangers. Maybe even a specific gender or race. These are as you know classic responses to abuse. 

How do we help the dog move past these? You are already doing the big part. A safe happy home, a good walk schedule and plenty of love and attention. The longer nothing bad happens to your pup the more he'll forget that anything can. 

Now how about some behavioral training. People tend to think if your dog doesnt like something then avoid it. Example. ""My dog doesnt like it when we touch his paws."" So they never do it. They pet his head, his back, give belly rubs. But never touch his paws. Because of this he freaks out when they try to trim his nails. How to fix this, incorporate paw touching into pets. A little at first then more and more. When you give treats put them into a sit or a down and put the treats under their paws. Play handshake. Make what they dont like fun by incorporating it into a game. 

How to apply this philosophy to your dog. Add an object to your play. A rope toy or large chew toy, if he likes fetch a chuckit works well. Something that if you raised it would incite his fear/defense response. Dont raise it. Keep it low and play. Every so often toss it over his head. Then pass/swoop it over his head. Have friends do it to when they come over. Or people at the dog park. Over time he will forget that sticks mean pain and remember that with you now they mean play. 

Carry treats with you on walks and ask people to give one to your dog. The more people he meets that dont hurt him is a pattern that your dog will recognize. 

Keep it fun. Never pressure them. He will let you know the pace he is comfortable with. Dogs dont learn things you want them to under pressure. They learn when its fun."
"My favorite part is how if they underpay you, you can expect the difference starting 3 paychecks from now and distributed over the following 4.

But if you are overpaid? Hope you didn't spend the extra, because that's coming out of your next check ASAP.

Air Force once randomly started sending my pay to someone else. Took half a dozen visits to Finance to get them to start addressing it, 2 more checks for them to actually fix the issue, and another 3 to have them slowly repay me.

Even Finance hates Finance."

Needed something wet to be able to function, so naturally I grab my monster right? Fucking score! Nope.

My actual fucking traumatic moment with them involved having a nice warm cup of hot cocoa. Hmmm what’s that? A part of the cocoa mix didn’t dissolve? I’d better roll it around with my tongue. Hmm. Didn’t work. Spit it out; it’s a baby roach- proceed to have an actual fucking meltdown at age 12.

"I would caution you to be careful putting them together until the kitten learns how to behave.  I had a experience where our big bad ""rescued"" pit cowered to a yippy chihuahua pup.  This pup was constantly nipping at the dogs cheeks, so he would retreat and hide out upstairs so he could rest.  Once the smaller dog was able to climb the stairs he startled the big dog during a nap and the bigger dog instinctively put a hole in the smaller dogs skull with his tooth.   He didn't mean to but it just happened that quickly.   I would advice you to keep them separated as much as possible until the kitty learns some boundaries.  At least that's what I would do, it was hard telling our friends that our wonderful pit killed a harmless puppy..."

"dang i am sorry to hear about this way i am sorry that you are in trouble with the BIG CITY that is to bad and sad days ahead. i have read these comments there are lots of good points so i think there are two ways of seeing this 

FIRST WAY is LEGAL WAY which says 'this is my heckin house i can listen to whatever the heck i want' so i think this is important and a true way if you are in your own house. i know many t-rex lawyers that will agree with this.

SECOND WAY IS REAL WORLD WAY so this way is saying just because you can dosnt mean you should. so i think in this way it might be nice to think 'hey maybe this buckaroo dosnt want to hear about this right now maybe it will make them uncomfortable in their skin?' so i think that really this is MOST IMPORTANT way to remember when talking about pounds and other things because this is a PRIVATE THING for many people. just because me and you are CONFIDENT in our way does not mean that others are so i think this is an important lesson. i do not think others should be upset with you about this way i just think that in the future you can say 'i know that it is my right to listen to this but maybe it will be poliete not to' so i hope that is okay

thank you for writing about this complicated situation i hope it can prove love for all and i hope you house gets fixed sorry that happened and also i hope the original fixer can feel better. even though i am comfortable with my way of preferred pounds i know there are some things that i am not comfortable with (like when buds start talking about the lonesome train too much it makes me sad to think on this journey too much) so anyway i hope they feel better.

thank you for this story i hope you will still listen to the BIG TIME PODCAST SHOW maybe next time on headphones or better yet say 'hey buds who can hear this im about to listen to something that might make you feel bad so is that okay?' then maybe they will say yes and you will make a new bud and if they say no thats okay too thanks"

"Back when I was a teenager and in Narcotics Anonymous, I was helping to set up a meeting. The meeting took place in the upper floor of a Volunteer Fire Station that was used as a hall for dinners and meetings and stuff. 

It was a hot summer day on a Thursday.  The Station had held a breakfast the Sunday before. 

There were some things to clean up, but not too bad.  I saw a large white box sitting on a table. I made the mistake of looking inside.

At first, I thought it was full of tissue paper or something. Then it moved.

It had formally been a mostly full box of bacon.  A few days of hot summer in the closed hall caused it to be a box of undulating maggots.

"Just in case anyone else is in the position of having no brakes on their bike suddenly: use your foot/shoe as a brake and softly jam it between the wheel and the frame or fork. Don't go full on or you'll flip over the handlebars, but it's routine for BMX riders without brakes to use their shoe as a friction brake on the tire. It will at least slow you down so that the bail isn't as rough. It might take some practice but it's worth knowing how to do in case your brakes go out!

"Unfortunately, I think I can top that. I want to say that I'm not proud of any of this.

I used to be very poor. My family lived in a shitty run-down house in a not-so-clean neighborhood. Tons of overgrowth all over the neighborhood, so the entire area was riddled with insects. Also this is Texas, where even nice, clean houses will get the occasional gigantic fucking cockroach.

But because I lived in a shitty house that was not sealed very well, we got them *all* the time. Several a day. It was a normal occurrence, and got so bad that sometimes you wouldn't even really notice them because it just became a part of life. You learned to never leave *anything* out, and make sure all your food is sealed airtight. 

Summers are always bad, because the cockroaches breed like crazy and they're pretty much everywhere all the time. But one day, we noticed there were a lot more than usual. So naturally we bust out the Raid and fly swatters and start going to town. Within about 30 minutes, we killed at least 10 of these fuckers. But they kept coming for some reason. After the first hour we were probably at about 50 roaches killed, one by one but almost nonstop. 

Then, out of nowhere, they started *flooding* out of the cracks in the walls and from under doors. They fucking swarmed. We saw dozens of them at a time, zooming about and running wildly across the entire fucking house. We tried what we could to swat and spray them, but we were desperately outnumbered. Our best guess is that a snake crawling around in the walls of the house must have tried attacking their nest, causing them to all panic and flee. 

Oh, did I mention these fuckers ***fly?*** Yeah. It looked like a scene from The Birds. 

We've since moved out of that place and it's been torn down. But that day seriously fucked with me, and I still actually get nightmares of that shit."
"Women love scars. Makes you look tough. And what's tougher than having your penis basically torn off and reattached? Nothing. 

In all seriousness though, it's honestly nothing to worry about. It probably just looks like a circumcision scar. At least that's what it sounds like. Also, when you're getting down to business with someone, you generally don't stare at their genitals lol I'm sure no one will even notice! Don't let it stop you from being intimate with someone.

This may sound silly, but if you're really insecure, look at pictures of penises. You'll learn there are soooo many different looking ones out there all with their own quirks. It'll make you realize you're perfectly normal :)"
Yes indeed. Got real un-excited fast. 
"If you are old and feeble or an infant, or have a weakened immune system. My cat saved my son from a bark scorpion. I was surprised she wasn't stung. She is 17-18 now. I find her sometimes looking at the wall meowing, reliving her glory days I guess."
"Australia, England, and probably most other English speaking Commonwealth countries. 

Speaking reflexively in your native idioms is a hard habit to break. You poor bloody sod. 

Pro tip: do not cross a pregnant lady."
"Agreed. At least his ""Faith in humanity resorted lol."""
"Someone in their 30's is a cougar?

Edit: English hard"

"One of my cats kills cockroaches, and another likes to eat them. Great team. We almost never see them alive, and rarely see bodies either! "

You’re not wrong
Lmao this is one of the trashiest stories I've ever heard
"It's stainless steel, not stainnever steel."
"""I'm different from the other guys"""
"Tells story to all of Reddit

Was worth the wait for this. Sounds like you bit off more than you could chew at the time.

Who was stupid enough to think a second kitten was a good idea? 
"Man that must suck. My old bus driver was my neighbor and I can remember one day, I must've been around 6, that he just cruised until I woke up. He said, ""You have a good nap, bud? Let's get you home."" I was the last stop on a long route."
"&gt; I'm kidding, I just want her to laugh at you

Lol, you bastard! 😂"
