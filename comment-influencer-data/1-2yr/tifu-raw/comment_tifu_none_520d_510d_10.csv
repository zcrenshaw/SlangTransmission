I am colorblind as well and work in IT.  Many times I have been sent to check out failed drive and couldn't tell the difference between red and green lights. I've found creative ways around it (take picture with phone and send to someone who can identify) or use app like colorblind pal to identify the colors.

"I did that to my orthodontist after having just a bowl of cereal too. He went in for an impression and boom, milky, grainy cereal all down me and down his shirt. I'll give him credit, though! He just left, was gone for a few minutes, then came back in a fresh scrub shirt and gave me one of his smallest spares. Told me to go get cleaned up, shit happens, and I could keep the scrub because it didn't fit him well anyway! He was a good guy."

I knew he was trying to scare me the first time, that was his hilarious way of letting me know he was color blind.  I took it super serious and now that 5 people have said what you just did I think he was joking...and when I started telling him the color of the lights he must have thought it was funny or cute or something and never told me it was unnecessary...Then I took over and did 98% of the driving.  So when he drives the other 2% and im like, ""Green."" he probably just smiles in his head about what a dumb ass I am.

"My husband does this to me.  I about shit my pants when we were dating and driving through town he says, ""Quick, is that light red or green?"", I was like, ""What?"", and he looked to the other lane and said, ""They aren't braking, its green.""...

He explained it was nice to have someone in the car that could see color.  His usual tactic was to get his indication from the vehicles around him.  The only time this didn't work is if he was pulling up to the light and there were no vehicles in front or beside him.  He would have to slow down and creep up to the light waiting for another driver to get to it.

I almost always drive but now its second nature for me to tell him what color the lights are, he doesn't even have to ask anymore.  

EDIT:  I want to delete this comment bc it shows what an idiot im capable of being...but its also sort of funny...So, several of you have said he should be able to tell the light color by the order.  I was a little taken aback by it bc it never ever occurred to me.  Then I realized....

"Funny you should mention that. When my wife went out of town to a conference in 2017 I was on my first watch through Game of Thrones. The first night she left I stopped at Taco Bell on the way home from work and bought one of those dozen taco boxes and a burrito for the commute.

After I got home I plopped in front of the television and turned on GOT. I was on Taco #11 when Daenerys was chowing down on a horse heart. I sat there trying to force this taco down my throat just as she starts to gag and wretch a little. I couldn't force it down, I kept gagging I was so full and the show wasn't helping. I put #11 down and passed out on the sofa. 12 hours later I woke up drenched in sweat, the first authentic meat sweats of my life. I had a moderate fever that lasted all morning, never thought food could cause that. 

I haven't gorged myself since then, I just don't have it in me to waste a day recovering from my own stupidity haha."

That said, here's a learning experience for you. Next time you feel like it might be a good idea to become involved in someone's relationship, rethink it. You did a stupid thing, and now there are several people paying the price, some of whom are completely innocent and undeserving (their kids). But the best and only thing you can REALLY do right now is to learn from your mistakes and never do ANYTHING like that again. We all do dumb crap, especially when we're young, hormonal, and thinking with our genitals instead of our brains. Cut communication, let her clean up her own mess. Any involvement from you at this point will only make it worse. And for God's sake, I hope you learned your lesson, lol!"

"Here is the definition of Spiderman:

&gt;When a girl is going down on you, and just before you climax you pull out of her mouth and nut in your own hand. Then fling the jism in her face, as you jump to your feet, making sure to properly mimic Spidey's web slinging hand motions. Now stand in a position of bravery, and power like any superhero would. Be sure not to react when she yells at you. Stand tall and proud, not too many guys get the chance to do that these days.

&gt;Sample usage:

&gt;Yeah so i nutted in my hand... And i was all like ""PLAH SPIDERMAN!!!"" And then she was all like ""WHAT THE...?"" And i was all like... ""shhhh baby, the games back on.""

"Years ago my Dad was working shipping.  A older employee got promoted and began working with him.  It took him forever to get the right boxes and my Dad was losing patience.   He told him that he had to work faster.  The guy cracked and started sobbing.  
In a factory with a majority of older male employees it was the first guy he ever saw crying on the job.  It was a really awkward situation; my Dad thought the guy was sick and dying.

The Man admitted that he couldn't read. He took the promotion because the pay for better but he just couldn't do the job.  Going back to his old job was too humiliating for him so he was thinking of quitting.

My Dad didn't want him to lose his job so he started color coding the boxes and they worked together until he retired. 

(When his Boss ask my Dad about the color coding he told him it was because the writing on the boxes were in English and a lot of employees couldn't understand it)
