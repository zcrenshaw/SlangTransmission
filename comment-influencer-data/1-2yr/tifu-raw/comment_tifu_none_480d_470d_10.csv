"Just a heads up, if you ever get the urge to 'splode something again, there's a compound called Tannerite which is legal to purchase, manufacture and detonate for reasons that I don't actually understand. It can be detonated by shooting it with a high velocity bullet. So go innawoods, fill up a pumpkin with the stuff (note, it's not recommended to use more than 2 lbs of Tannerite per detonation), and shoot it with grandpappy's .30-06.

Edit: if you're gonna fuck around with Tannerite, don't put it in anything too hard, don't use a ton of it, and blow it from a safe distance. There's quite a few videos out there of people getting hurt  (or nearly) because they decided to pack a vehicle with 100 lbs of the stuff and shoot it from 30 feet away. Do not do this. Its why I specified that a pumpkin would be a good choice for something to blow up, and included the manufacturer recommendation on maximum use."

"Yeah I do everything from light sedation to full general anesthesia. With a colonoscopy you are definitely not awake. You might talk silly for a min or two, but the majority of the time you are just sawing logs. This deeper sedation is referred
to as a “MAC” or monitored anesthesia care. Conscious sedation can be given by a RN, but a MAC will only be given by nurse anesthetists or anesthesiologists. 

For a true conscious sedation case, where a person is actually arousable, the drug of choice is versed. It inhibits the brain’s ability to form new memories. So the person is often awake and talking, but has no memory of it. 

E: fun facts

The inability to form new memories is called anterograde amnesia

Versed is one of the drugs known to be a “truth serum.” I often joke with the spouse of my patients that I’ll get them access to the secret Swiss bank account

"My aunts husband did that and immediately he laid down on the (kitchen) floor and went to sleep. We tried multiple times to wake him and move him to bed. Nobody thought anything of it (nor did I know he was on heart meds). The next morning when everyone was up, he said if it was ever to happen again immediately take him to the hospital. He had no idea what was happening and when he finally came to he didn’t know where he was for a decent amount of time. Glad both of y’all are okay. 
Tl;Dr Don’t play games with heart meds, you won’t win. "

I would contact your landlord and break the lease as soon as possible for breach of contract and unlivable conditions. 
Well you fucked up in front of a lot of people. It made for interesting conversation but people have a short memory and you likely have a skillset in demand.

"Sounds like the fakest shit to ever grace this board.

I bet my father would've, even more so my *mother* gone to reddit to post about how they caught me jerking it. Sure thing.

"I think his problem or concern with the whole situation is how unwilling Google is to even communicate with them. It’s a bad business practice, especially for a “one bad apple, nuke the whole harvest” situation like this. "
"&gt;Assume any odd phrase that seems irrelevant or out of place is a *junk* for his junk and it’ll make sense.

It still doesn't make any sense :/

Edit: Uh.. look at the quoted part again. I didn't understand the word 'euphemism' and replaced it with junk, but it didn't work. That's what I meant.

Fun fact: There is no such thing as a fart when you take that laxative.  
literally slapping my knee 
"Suspensions are generally permanent, so not too much luck there, sadly. It's unfair and a piece of crap. Youtube support is basically a FAQ and ""getting help"" equals to talking to other youtube users with no more power or authority than you have.

I mean I'm hoping someone proves me wrong and gets me an email that actually works but for now, I'm screwed."

I love Australian storytelling!

"I can assure you there more to the story than this. Firstly there's no connection between consumer accounts and GSuite accounts, and Google do not suspend entire customer domains for single user behavior. It's most likely that IT haven't updated the credit card details to be perfectly honest."
"Thanks buddy. Yea, I plan to propose again  *officially* on a family cruise we’re taking to the Caribbean later next month as a “celebration of life” to her grandma she was named after, who past away recently.

No one is aware what’s going to happen, but we each had to choose 1 excursion that we’ll do as a group, no excuses, everyone has to participate. (Her side is very strong about family values and doing things together no matter what)

Anyway, so my choice for one of the excursions is called a “Catamaran Caribbean sunset”  where you get to rent a giant catamaran for like $150 an hour with a Captain to navigate and they have champagne included. 

The immediate family will be there for the proposal so it’s more intimate &amp; memorable. 
She was very close with her grandma, being her namesake and all, so that’s what they both would’ve wanted.  A very intimate proposal event with immediate family."

Pistachios in the Dark sounds like the title to David Duchovny's memoirs. 
"That is so fucked up. 

Coming off meds like that without the proper tapering can seriously fuck with your head. 

If it was me I'd try and get a hold of the contractors HR and ask why you are not allowed in as a guest OR as an interviewee.  There is a good chance someone told porkies like illegal drug use.  Or anything other than 'yeah we told him to stop his meds and that fucked him up' "

Tell him you are underage and if he shares pictures of your dick he faces jail time. 
I doubt they even recognized it. Its not like it was ever a popular tune in the west.  And except for occasional snippets being played In cold war era spy movies most people would have had no reason to even hear it.  They probably just looked at you funny because you were annoying kids in general.  That's the way most adults look at people under the age of 20.
