"I feel it man, I have worked for a school for the past five years, and I get a student making a suicide joke at least once a month. The law requires that we report it even if we think it is a joke.

"For good reason though. A lot of people with suicidal ideation will use humor to test the waters to see if its okay to ask for help or as a subtle cry for assistance. If they send 100 students who are just joking and save 3 people's lives, that's a massive win. 

Some people seem to believe this is the school wanting to punish them by sending them to detention or something. I mean zero offense when I say this, but if this policy can save a few lives, or prevent another school shooting incident because no one paid attention, that's kind of a good thing. It's also not months of mandatory therapy. You go in for a single consult, the doc says you're fine and you walk out. They only keep you if they deem you to actually need it-- they ain't paying for that if they don't have to. "

"Try taking over feeding duties, so the cat associates you with food. If he's in one room, try sitting in the same room at a distance without attempting to approach him and don't chase him if he runs out. Try sitting near someone cuddling him, and slowly get closer over a course of days/weeks and see how close you can sit without disturbing him. If he actively likes being brushed, get his brush out every now and then when he's in the same room as you and just sit there with it and see if he approaches. If he does, brush him for a few seconds then wait and follow his lead. Sitting or lying down makes you seem less of a threat and he's more likely to come over and check you out, and avoid eye contact.

It sounds like he's comfortable in the home environment and that's usually the first step in gaining a cat's trust, but just go slow. Don't try too hard to make him like you again. He will eventually, just don't try too hard or you'll just end up pissing him off. Ignore him a bit, if need be."

"if your pee turns brown or seems unusually concentrated...see a doctor asap - rhabdomyolysis is no joke.
source: have had rhabdo after hitting the gym hard again after a long break.

**EDIT:** So since I'm a bit shit at reddit and this post already has exposure - I might as well add what I can to it, from my personal experience at least.

For context I'm a 25 year old in average shape, mostly just getting in a bit of cardio now and then and this happened to me just after NYE - so very recently. Hell, I'm getting my CK levels checked again in 2 days to see if they've finally normalised.
I got rhabdo after starting to hit the gym again following a prolonged absence (more than a year) from any real weight training. I even decided to shell out on a personal trainer to ease me back into things, but that didn't prevent it. The tissues most affected were my triceps.

First day in the gym with him (Monday) was basic circuit training as an assessment of sorts, followed by some stretching and figuring out my goals - went home feeling tired, but happy and limber.

Second day (Tuesday) was chest and triceps - but once again, was more of an assessment. 
Since it was the day that screwed me, the exercises I did were: barbell bench press, incline bench press, tricep pushdowns, push-ups and dips followed by some ab-work. I ended up going to failure during the push-ups far faster than I expected to but chalked it up to being out of practice. I also went to failure with the dips.
When I went home I felt sore as hell but satisfied, to be honest, I was looking forward to the DOMS after so long. During the night I felt sore and tight in my arms, chest and abs - as expected - but had no trouble falling asleep.

The third day (Wednesday) was leg day - which was a relief since my upper body was screaming. I remember feeling like I was getting a full workout just trying to brush my teeth and get dressed. I did feel that it was worse than the average DOMS, but I thought that was only natural after being away from the gym for so long. Anyway, legs went well but I made sure to tell my trainer that I was still feeling surprisingly tight and wasn't sure if I could do back and biceps on Friday or Saturday like we were planning to.
After changing and getting home, I crawled/slithered into bed since my arms were so weak and painful and decided to just rest up for the remainder of the day.
I think woke up a few times during the night due to the pain of rolling onto my sides, but even at this point thought it was still just a particularly bad case of the DOMS. 

I ended up changing plans so that I could study at home and stay in bed for most of Thursday too. I was trying to drink more than I usually do because I'd noticed my urine was pretty concentrated, but once again thought little of it.

Finally on Friday morning I got lazy and took a piss while showering. When I looked down and saw myself pissing what looked like tea or oil I freaked the fuck out. I thought it looked like there was blood in there and headed to my local GP's. By the time I saw him, I felt that rhabdo was the most likely possibility - but still didn't feel I had pushed myself anywhere near hard enough to actually have it. 
After my bloods came back it turned out that my CK was more than a thousand times above the reference range. After some further testing, it became apparent that I was very lucky to have not sustained any real kidney damage.
In essence if I was perhaps a bit older, less worried about hydration or simply hadn't decided to piss in the shower and carried on in the gym for another day or two, things could have been a lot worse.

In hindsight, even though I messed myself up the most on tuesday, the fact that I drank quite a lot on sunday during NYE would have meant I was still pretty dehydrated throughout my workouts which would have definitely contributed.

TL;DR Rhabdo is much easier to get than you think, especially if you aren't hydrated. If you have to put someone on speaker just to ease the pain of holding your phone up, it's might be more than just DOMS. Pee in the shower just to be sure."

"Ah well.  Most likely (unless you stumble onto some underlying issues) the therapist will recognize things right away and you can use the therapy time for growth in areas that might help you going forward - goal setting, etc.  Kind of an ""if I gotta be here, lets make something out of it"" deal."

Find a new job.. that behavior from your boss is unprofessional. If the box was out when you arrived then it was not your responsibility. Whomever accepted the delivery should have put it away rather than leave it there and for you to be given a month off as punishment is ridiculous. Take the month to find a new job and don't go back. I've worked in a place like that and it was hell.

"There was a news article that popped on /r/offbeat (I think) sometime in the last year of a group of friends who had plans to go on a trip somewhere exotic together. The only thing was, one of them came down sick, or pregnant, or something of the sort, and wasn't able to go. They already had the plane ticket booked though, so they searched online for somebody with the same name to go with them. Somebody did indeed respond to the offer, and went with this group of friends on the trip. Apparently they all had a kickass time and really did become best buds for life.

So who knows, maybe OP just won the friend jackpot!"

"Yes, coming from an ICU nurse this whole story screams rhabdo. Your organs eventually shut down if you aren't treated. You probably damaged quite a bit of your muscles biking that long. What concerns me is that you still can barely walk after 3 days. I would just go ahead to the emergency room and get labs done, particularity a CPK level- that's the main indicator of rhabdo. They will give you lots and lots of fluid through an IV to filter all those damaged muscle cells through your kidneys.

Just to add extra: I know reading this looks really scary- everything will be ok. If you do have rhabdo, the doctors and nurses do everything they can to treat your pain so you're comfortable. They'll closely monitor the CPK/MB levels, kidney function, electrolytes, etc. You'll look back on this and have a good laugh"

"Dude this sounds like an epic story in the making!

I once took a cab driver to a hockey game (100 levels, directly in front of boxes good seats, but I got em free). I wasn't allowed In with my bag that contained approx $600 in electronics. Wasn't stashing that. Tried to upgrade the tickets if a father/son duo free: nobody would take em.

Almost got in a fight with a scalper.

I'd been shooting the shit with the cabbie for a few and asked him if he wanted to work.

""Fuck no""

""You can come watch the game if I can stash my bag in your car""

""Gimme your bag ill be in in 5""

He came in with beer and pizza, turns out to be a music producer who moved to Canada. Chill guy, talked music and hockey.

Game ends: he never parked the car with the valet ticket I gave him. Stuck it on the fucking curb in front of the arena (cab car, didn't get towed) we were out of the parking lot before 80% of the arena had even left yet.

Afterwards he gave me a free ride all the way downtown (35-50 cuz of the hockey game) directly to the door of a concert I was invited to that night.

Moral: sometimes the least expected adventure can become the most hype. Go to the concert, this is a TIFU now but it's gonna be a story soon."

Gotta report it by law or they'll be held responsible. I've known a bunch of people who joke about suicide in a really obviously fake way and you find out a year or two later that one of them were actually super considering it and only held off by a thread. 
"Actually the reason is faulty. A lot of recent research has shown that it has nothing to do with the actual joking about suicide, but a lot more to do with depressed people tend to have a more humorous take in life. It all revolves around Terror Management Theory, where anxiety towards morality dictates your behavior.

So its a situation of correlations vs causation. Joking about suicide isn't because people are testing the waters, but there is a correlation between people with morbid senses of humor and suicide."

"You don’t need that job at your age so PLEASE find another one.

Get a meeting with the big boss who said it didn’t matter, hand in your resignation, and explain that your manager has victimised you by illegally withholding shifts from you. Even if you’re on a zero hour contract, most laws say that you cannot just withhold shifts - if you’re “usually” working X number of hours a week, they can slowly reduce them but they can’t just stop them without good reason - and a good reason includes a disciplinary.

If you were told to put the cheese away then yes it’s your fault. But as a “trainee” it’s your managers fault for not being present and specific about what to do. How the hell were you meant to know that the box was full of cheese and that it needed refrigeration? For all you know, a chef or whoever could’ve left it out to come back for it 5 minutes later. 

Your manager knows she screwed up which is why she’s taking it out on you. You will face people like this in your professional life. What’s important is that you follow the rules as they have been explained to you, and that any lapses in explanation are the fault of your manager. Stick to the book and any bitchy behaviour that results must be reported and dealt with. NEVER just “let it fly”. You need to be known as someone not to be messed with otherwise people will use you as a scapegoat for everything they screw up.

Simply explain to the boss that you don’t want to leave, but as this is clearly a personal punishment for something that wasn’t your fault, you have no choice. You’re here to learn and help, not be used in stupid mind games. Thank him for his time and make him aware of this manager’s screw up and attempted scapegoating of you.

"Ha I had this SAME fuckup in school years ago, except I didn't say anything.... a kid stole my notebook with all the lyrics to the songs I was writing, and after reading through it to make fun of me turned it in.

BAM mandatory therapy and they called my parents who had a mental breakdown over the idea their son might be suicidal...

The reality is, them going nutso over the whole thing instead of just saying ""hey whats this book about"" to me actually MADE me want to run away or commit suicide out of sheer embarrassment. The mandatory therapy sessions were a complete joke too. Guy right away looked at me and was like ""you really don't belong here do you"" after asking me a few questions to gauge my mental state. I think I went 1-2 more times before he went to the principle and vise and told them that they were overreacting.

I say “someone” is dipping into the till by writing off these “spoiled” items and selling out the back door. I’ve seen this happen at the supermarket where I worked deli and also at a restaurant  where I worked. The chef would sell a case of steaks, uncooked, out of the back door, for cash, during the height of a Friday night rush.  He would write off the steaks as returns to the kitchen. He made sure he would yell at someone for over cooking steaks while he was doing the waste inventory. He eventually got caught when one of his assistants fished the garbage out at the end of the shift and recounted the wasted steaks in front of the whole kitchen.

I did something similar to my old roommate’s cat (I got annoyed cuz he was scratching the door and I yelled at him) and he acted similarly to your cat. Normally he’d wander into my room and get really close to me but after I did that he ran whenever I got close and kept a good distance from me otherwise. So I got him some treats and apologized to him. It may seem silly to think of apologizing to a cat but he understood my tone of voice and he let me get near him while I was apologizing. I also played with him for a really long time. It helped that I also fed him and spent more time with him than my roommate so he already liked being around me. I’m sure if you put enough effort into spending time with the cat and getting the cat to associate you with more positive experiences he’ll start acting normally again. 
If everybody responded like you did far less stores would be robbed. 
"My friend met his wife on a wrong number.  They ended up texting back and forth, then basically all the time and since they day they met, you couldn’t keep them apart.  

Enjoy your new friend.  Don’t kiss him on the first date, play hard to get...."
":( I'm sad that this is required.

The other day some guy replied to my comment and was being a jerk. Just to see I looked through his recent history. Earlier that day, he had been on r/suicidewatch. Giving someone advice on more effective ways to kill himself.

I hate how awful people can be sometimes."
As a mount or a melee weapon?
"I do triathlons and I can’t imagine how on earth you managed that. For me fours on a trainer on a stationary bike is nuts and mind numbingly boring so if you have that kind of stamina  and mental fortitude now, the world of endurance sports had better watch out if you ever decide to get involved. And for what it’s worth, I hope you do look at doing a triathlon as it’s an awesome sport and you’d be warmly welcomed wherever it is in the world you are from. Congrats!"
"I agree with you, going to therapy isn't necessarily a bad thing."
"So at T &lt; 0, things started to heat up... I know this may sound useless but is really essential in understanding how I accidentally mooned the church choir last Sunday."

"Pro-tip: never prank someone involving anything they use on their skin or hair. 

I know it doesn't seem like it but it's kinda like fucking with someone's medication. 

Skin is *very* sensitive and without trying to generalize, many women spend years learning what works for them and what doesn't. 

You really didn't think and showed some obviously negligent behaviour towards your girlfriend. 

Frankly, the whole story says to me that you do not actively listen to her and are dismissive and disrespectful of her personal items and care.

Before reading your post I thought you were no longer in speaking terms with your family over the cat 
You mean your ex-girlfriend

Electric powered water gun that fits in your mouth. You blast away stuff between your teeth 
"I was involved in a similar incident in college. I told my councilor what happened (which took 3 minutes of the first session) then shot the shit about photography every session till I was done. They see a lot of these ""false positives"""

"Expected this to be your regular fake lottery story : She was surprised,  I broke the news to her.  Now she's sad and I feel like an asshole.

"Bby girl. (Or boy, since I don't think you specified.) I'm so sorry this happened to you.

Do me a favor. When you wash your face, you probably do it with some water and soap, right? And rub kinda hard? And it doesn't really hurt or feel bad or anything?

Try rubbing your face in the same way that you do when you wash it, except no soap and water. Rub real hard. Especially around the eyes and ears and the weird little spots right next to your nose. Kinda hurts, yeah? Pulls the skin around a little? Gives you some friction burns a bit?

So that's why we use lube for anal -- because unlike the vagina, there's really no natural lube back there, and so the dry skin of his penis just pulls around against the dry skin of your butt, and neither of you are gonna really be happy with it. Plus, with the sudden stretching of the external and internal anal sphincters, the muscles get a bit strained too, like trying to do a split without any practice, and so it's a really good idea to do a gradual warmup from one finger to a few fingers to a smallish toy before inserting a whole penis. (I know, I know, they don't look like they use lube or do any warmup in porn! ... But that's just because everyone is prepped before the cameras roll, including gentle stretching of the anus and liberal application of lube to the outside and inside of the butt. Often times, they'll use silicone lube, too; some formulations are less shiny than water-based lube, in addition to lasting longer and not getting sticky, so it doesn't look like there's much there, and they don't have to re-up as often.) So since you guys seem to both be into the idea, I'd recommend getting some lube and maybe some beginner toys, just to have around for the next time you feel ""inspired."" 

Sliquid Sassy is one I recommend a lot; it's glycerin-free, propylene glycol-free, and paraben-free, and has a thick texture to last longer and not drip as much as basic lubes. You can also do the silicone lube route, but be sure to spot test before using silicone lube on silicone toys (a lot of toys and lubes just aren't compatible, and you can damage your toy).

And anyway, I recommend using silicone toys at first; it's the only non-porous, non-toxic sex toy material that doesn't have to be rock hard, and as a beginner you really want some squish for comfort. (If you're not familiar with safe sex toy materials, check out the r/SexToys wiki: reddit.com/r/SexToys/wiki/index for a basic rundown of dos and don'ts, plus google ""Dangerous Lilly Amazon"" for an explanation of why it's not a great idea to buy your sex toys from there.)

I hope you're not too scarred from the experience to consider trying again, properly this time :) give yourself a few days, at the very least, to heal and relax a little bit, and don't think about it until then. Get some lube and toys, just to have on hand, and then the next time you guys are feeling naughty, start slow. It doesn't have to be all the way the first time. You might just lube up and use some fingers during regular sex. Next time you're feeling it, maybe move up to a small plug or dildo during or after or before sex. Make sure you're comfortable at all times, and if you're not, it's totally okay to say ""hey, okay, that's a lot to handle, I think I'm done with anal for today."" Anal **does not hurt** when it's done right (might feel uncomfortable and weird, like you need to poop, but actual pain means something is wrong, stop what you're doing). For this reason, I also never recommend desensitizers or numbing agents for beginners! You need to be able to feel that pain if it happens, so you know when to stop.

Good luck to you, and I hope you feel better soon :)"
"Not gonna lie, I upvoted this"
"sounds great but you gave your 600$ electronics to a stranger who promised to ""be in in 5"", sounds risky"

"That's funny because I'm reading this on my iPhone 6 and I just got home from work and I need to cook dinner. When I left work I went to the nearest shop to get some eggs for dinner and without looking at the price I grabbed a 12 pack and scanned it at the self checkout... nearly £4 for a fucking box of eggs. 

Outrage. I cancelled the item but that required a store assistant to come and verify it... and she took the eggs and put them back and I felt guilty for putting her through that simply because I didn't look at the price. I ended up buying 2 packets of hollandaise sauce. 

Anyway, I decided to go to a newsagent closer to home since it's cheaper, got to the counter and he says the card machine's not working SO I had to cross the road (it's a really busy road) withdraw cash and the go back for the eggs. The worst part is he didn't even have any £5 notes so I got all my change in coins which I'll now have to deposit at the bank because I hate carrying cash.

Anyway my fuckup was when I accidentally smashed my head on a shelf at work"
