Your manager is a dumbass
Shout out to all the single shrimp moms out there
"A total pushover, too."
Shrimpin' ain't easy
"Stuff like this is what makes me wary about serving older customers. It seems like there's no grey area. They're either nice, or have the patience and temperament of two-year olds."
"I get customers threaten to tell my manager Jim how rude I'm being when I won't let them do something not allowed. Jim hasn't been my manager in over a year in a half ever since he transferred closer to his home. I tell them next time they're at our store in Show Low (150 miles away) to go ahead and tell Jim what I'm up to. I haven't heard a peep from Jim yet so I guess none of them wanna make the drive.

Customers are a hoot sometimes."
"It sounds like he was trying to pull a bait and switch, but didn't have a clue of how to do it properly. It seems to me that he was trying to make you nervous so that you'd just give him the umbrellas, but when it wasn't working the way he wanted it to, he got frustrated and gave up."
Awe! This warmed the cockles of my cold retail heart! 
"Pretty common, it'll be almost midnight at my store and people will bitch about us only having one or two registers open. 

I'm usually tempted to say ""who has two thumbs and didn't make the schedule?"" _points at self_"
"Nah, she's just a spiteful hag, who hates her own life and only receives brief glimpses of happiness by making others as miserable as herself.

You just keep on folding the way you do. "
I should add we both remained very professional and cordial to the couple. He just didn’t get what he wanted and was in disbelief and looked a little defeated as he walked out.
"Retail made me hate old people in public. Not them as a whole, but if I see one in a store, there’s a good chance I’m getting pissed off"
"What a dummy.  Every good fashion stylist knows you put tape on the bottom so you can return them ""unused."""
Next time try it with your best Thanos voice: “Our tills need to be perfectly balanced at the end of the day. As all things should be.” 
"""Oh no register? That means its free?"""
The bloody nerve she has. It's infuriating.
"This has all the feels of the Christmas Shoes song.  I cry like a baby every time I listen to it, and I did the same now.  Props to the owner, I’m sure it meant more to the little boy than anything in the world."
"That's pretty much been my experience with them in the last three years, it's pretty black or white. 
They're also the ones who will spend $80 on truffles and then complain that bags cost $.05(which is the law by the way, not our decision!)."
"When I worked in my dad’s office (he’s a doctor), I used to get the same crap. “The doctor said to put me straight through because I’m a close family friend!!” “Uuuuh really? Such a close family friend that I, someone in the doctor’s family, *have never ever heard of you*??”"
"&gt;He gave me a huge look of disbelief


Ironic because that's exactly the same look I'd be giving him at his stupidity. "
What a bunch of immature disrespectful asshats. 
"I once had a customer “teach” me how to fold jeans. She lined up imaginary pleats and everything.

Lady, it’s denim. It’s flat front. You’re wrong. "
People love to try to do this at our store with luggage.  Once we found a successful return on the shelf with a unopened southwest pretzel bag inside of it.

"That's hilarious! 

Also, what other information did she think you'd have? I mean, where it's from, how many per pound, fresh/frozen, and the taste are really all that's important when buying. Anything else isn't really going to make a difference in how they turn out or can be used."
He was a salty boi
"I didn't know the true meaning of the word ""panic"" before I started working as a cashier.

Panic is: that feeling when you know you have very little change in your till and a customer approaches with a large bill for a cheap purchase."
"Normally, it's when a customer tries to pay for a cheaper item, then confuse you into letting them take the more expensive one. This post makes me think of it because the guy made a big deal about the umbrellas being too expensive and wanting the ponchos, then seemingly trying to sneak an umbrella into the purchase while paying for ponchos, perhaps thinking that if he frustrates/confuses the clerk enough he can take the umbrella like it's part of what he paid for."
"For a minute, I was worried she was one of those people who gets offended that the store 'thinks she needs sales to afford items'. I'm glad she was only joking, but I bet she'd have been embarrassed if she saw some of the tales on here where people freak out about sales for exactly this reason."
"""Your urgency is not my emergency"""
"Known your dad for years, didn’t know he had a son that worked in the store."
"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
(deep breath)
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha"
"You better safe that one for your last few days, lol"
You mentioned it messing up your sales - do you guys make commission? Cuz I'd be real pissed off if my mangers pushover-ness meant a smaller paycheck for me
Does he think cashiers work on commission?  LMAO
"My store recently removed one of my tills, so now we have three for my department.

So now we have an empty space at the end of our desk. We normally use it to dump unwanted clothes, or to do our folds. Customers don’t see this. 

When we’re busy and all the other three tills are being used, I have had customers yell at me to open another register “RIGHT THERE!” 

There is nothing there Janice. There is no computer, no scanner. You will wait. And suffer. "
"So I have heard the term ""bait and switch"" but I'm not 100% sure of the meaning in a retail setting. What is it I should be watching out for?"
"I will never, ever, EVER understand why it isnt common practice for everyone to have ID on them at all times. It would eliminate SOOOOOOO much hassle everywhere..."
"&gt;Is it really too difficult to understand that parking in the fuel lanes is only for customers getting fuel?

I once knew somebody that did this. She parked in the fuel lane and left me in the passenger. It was a crowded place too. She considered it a ""life hack"". I'm like wtf, there are designated parking spots for walk-ins customers."
"&gt;Me: Ma’am, i’m sorry but i have to end your transaction as any tender  on my account after i’m supposed to leave can get me in trouble, regardless of the circumstances.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: Well that’s your problem, so finish scanning my items please and you can go once you’re done.

Just based on this one exchange, I am thinking this lady is a psychopath. What a total lack of empathy."
"My parents own a restaurant. I remember one time I was working the drive thru and I asked the woman if she wanted to add fries because our basket (value meal thing) was the special that day and it would be cheaper. She told me we didn’t have fries. I just kinda paused a second and told her we did. She snapped back that if we did we just added them. I told her we’d had them for years, and had added them at least 10 years before. She told me she knew the owner and that I was obviously not familiar because I clearly couldn’t have been there for more than a year. The look on her face when I told her I remember when we started selling them because my dad, the owner, added them right after he bought the place was priceless. "
"Answer for your next incident: “Would it kill YOU, if you asked nicely?”"
"I don't get people like this.  My childhood bestfriend opened up a boutique.  When I visit my home town I'll stop there and buy something because I want to support my friend.  

If she's there she generally gives me a discount.  If she's not there I don't harrass employees for a discount."
"If you listen very closely, you can hear the reverberations of thousands of retail workers facepalming themselves hard enough to cause damage........"
"I worked at a only-ladies gym that rhymed with “smurves”. On Saturdays, we were open until noon. Last lady leaves at noon, so I turn off the music and the computers and start wiping down the equipment while my boss sits just out of sight and does bookkeeping. 

At 12:20, a lady walks in (knew I shoulda locked the door!!!) and unsuccessfully tries to scan her keychain several times. I’m just watching her, mouth agape, waiting for her to finally clue into what’s happening. She finally looks up and sees me, and **SNAPS HER FINGERS AT ME** and points to the scanner. 

Her: “This is broken!!”

Me: “One, please do not snap your fingers at me. I am a human being, not a dog. Two, it isn’t broken. It’s turned off.”

Her: “Why is it turned off??”

Me: “...Because we’re closed.”

Her: “No, you’re not.” [tries swiping her keychain again, all my wuts?]

Me: “Yes, we are. On Saturday, we close at noon.”

Her: “On Saturday, you close at *two.*”

Me: “No. We close at noon on Saturday. We have always closed at noon on Saturday.”

Her: [like a damned toddler] “***ON SATURDAYS, YOU CLOSE AT TWO!!! I WILL HAVE YOU FIRED!!!!!”***

Boss: [coming around the corner] “We close at noon. Go look at the door.”

[Lady goes and looks at the door, comes back in.]

Her: “WHEN DID THAT CHANGE?!?”

Boss: “Never. We have always closed at noon on Saturday.”

Her: “**TURN THIS COMPUTER ON SO I CAN DO MY WORKOUT!!! RIGHT!!! NOW!!!!**”

Boss: “.....Sure thing. Wait here a moment.”

[Lady gets smug smile on her face and whispers, “You’re so fired!” to me. Boss returns with a check.]

Boss: “May I see your keychain, please?” [Lady hands it over, then goes purple as Boss snaps it in half and hands her the check] “There’s your membership money back. You’re banned. Don’t snap your fingers at my employees. Don’t yell at them because you can’t be bothered to read. And don’t bother going to [other location] because I own that location, too.”

Lady could say nothing and just huffed out. 
I bought my boss a dozen doughnuts the next day. "
"Don't know what you're on about. Standing behind them for 3 minutes at a time as they park their cart diagonally across the aisle and stand next to it while they focus too hard on the 2 different kinds of flour to hear your ""excuse me""s gives your day a nice change of pace imo."
I was fuming when i went home
I'd be careful of that second co-worker.
Should suggest he go with the kraft deli singles
"""Why would I? He has you, you old bag."""
"And then he waddled away... til the very next day.

"Cockles. Maybe even deeper in the sub-cockle region. Maybe the liver, maybe the kidneys, maybe even the colon."
"Back when I worked in retail, we had a crazy lady who would come in and refold some of our towels in what she considered the correct way; I have no idea why she thought that was a good way to spend her time. It was really irritating having to go fix everything she'd messed up."
"We don't do cash back in our store, and it's amazing the number of people who are astounded and offended by that. Had an older woman a long time ago who informed me that ""if it's debit, you HAVE to give cash back, that's what it means!"" Uh, no, and at that time our system processed all cards as credit, which pissed off people for various reasons as well."
You'd think that before going into any country he'd check into getting the local currency. Seems like the logical thing to do but customers usually aren't logical. Everything is supposed to be for their convenience (in their opinion) including paying however and with whatever they want. 🙄
