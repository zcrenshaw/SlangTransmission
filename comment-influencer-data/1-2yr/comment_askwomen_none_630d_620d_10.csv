"Words on walls.  I don't need to be told to EAT in the kitchen, or that the HAPPY family is built on LOVE.  

Of course that is personal taste and I don't really care what people do in their own homes!"
"I dunno, seems kind of basic, you know? Like it seems as though every guy I meet is just out there, breathin' away, picking at his poppyseed muffin and just being a run-of-the-mill average exhaler, ugh.  
  
I dunno about anyone else, but I'm looking for a man who's evolved past the need for oxygen, it just seems so *old fashioned.*"
Don't stick with a mistake just because you spent a long time making it.
"I fully support their choice, if that's the lifestyle they choose to live. I've never had a problem with men who breathe, in fact several of my friends are male ""breathers"". "
"My boyfriend is impressively oblivious when women hit on him. There were a lot of times he didn't realize girls were hitting on him, but there is one that still makes me laugh 3 years later.  

He is a musician and he just finished playing his set. He would always come out and meet people at the mercy tables after to hang out with people interested in buying shirts, etc. 

My friend and I were having drinks about 30 feet from where my boyfriend was standing, and this girl comes up and starts talking to him. She starts asking about his tattoos.. and keeps touching his arm to ""look at the tattoos"". He started telling her all about the meaning behind them, and going into full details about where he got them, etc. She would step closer to him and touch his arm again and he would take a step back and just happily continue talking all about his tattoos. This happened 2 or 3 times. I could see from a mile away what was happening and thought it was hilarious. My friend asked if I was going to go stop it, and I said no because he had no idea what was happening, and quite honewtly, it was fucking hilarious. When she finally left, I told him what happened and he was still convinced she wasn't hitting on him, only that she was friendly and was interested in his sleeve. 

Babe. She didn't give a fuck about your tattoos."
"My high school sweetheart. He was a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù and had been arrested a couple of times before I met him. He straightened up when we met, his mom used to call me his angel. We all thought we were headed for marriage. Due to a bad home life, I lived with his family my senior year of high school. I still love them deeply. 

He broke up with me on prom night.. and I moved in with my grandpa and basically was comatose until college classes started. In August I met my now husband. 

After he found out I was dating, he tried everything to get me back and even though I was still very much in love with him - I couldn‚Äôt go back, he‚Äôd hurt me too much and I couldn‚Äôt give him that chance again. Over the next year, he wound up in the psych ward twice for attempting suicide. Both times calling me to come save him. I was sympathetic but knew I had to move on to save myself so I cut him off. 

He was later diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and from what I‚Äôm told, never really recovered from our break up. I saw him once a couple years ago and he was high - foaming out of his mouth. So I called his mother, his sponsor, and an ambulance and put him in my car to wait. His mother told me to never come back, he was still in love with me. That hurt, but that‚Äôs what I did. 

He‚Äôs in prison now. "
"Enough daily to possibly make anyone else within earshot roll their eyes. 

"
"For example, yesterday my boyfriend was telling me about how a woman in his office added him on Facebook &amp; then while at work she mentioned she saw that he was in a relationship. His other office mate chimed in saying that we are getting married &amp; my boyfriend told her a bit about me. Then she said ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs nice... do you ever wonder if there‚Äôs someone better out there though?‚Äù My bf was totally caught off guard &amp; she continued, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with my bf for 3years &amp; I think I love him. But I work with such attractive men here, I think I‚Äôd probably leave him if any of them gave me a chance.‚Äù

My bf thought it was a weird story, meanwhile I‚Äôm sitting there laughing because she was clearly coming onto him &amp; he was oblivious. It was kinda cute. "
"Speaking as someone's ""one who got away"", I know that *I* was the dodged bullet because of how much I changed. We had a chance to reconnect after I graduated from college and he was in a bad marriage. I got to see him as an adult and he got to see me for one too. The spark was still there but we were on totally different planes, we wouldn't have made it and we wouldn't have been happy long-term.

For anyone still pining for a lost love, please know that you're time-locked and your memories very likely wouldn't live up to the present and who you are as different people. It's ok to let go and seek new."
"That they don't get many compliments.

I now give a *lot* of non-sexual compliments to a lot of men.  Every man in my life now knows when I think something positive about his shirt."
"This thing where you buy an old house full of beautiful wood moldings and ""character"", and then *paint it all white*."
We were at this bar that has a whole bunch of arcade games. I disappeared to go to the bathroom and this girl came up to him and started stroking my boyfriend's back and telling him how good he was at Shrek pinball. My boyfriend had a mild moment of panic because he's an awkward guy and is pretty socially anxious so he just straight up sped walked away to come find me. 
"Swallow your damn pride.  It's hard to admit you're wrong or being a shit, but if you are, for the sake of the relationship and your partner, own up to it and try to make changes.  


This one does not come easy to me. At all. But it's important. "
"I had a guy stab me because I turned him down at a party.  I am not sure if his intent was to actually kill me or if he was just attacking me for funsies without purpose.

I still hate guys approaching me cold.  I doubt I will ever get over it.

What else happened?  I had to go stay in the hospital and get my first GYN appt because I had a stomach wound which was possible to have affected my reproductive stuffs.

Also, I was 14 when this happened."
It's really inconvenient. How am I supposed to comfortably lay on their chest while it's *moving*?
Sounds like a great way to get most women to stop using their website. We already have to deal with enough creeps when just using a username.
"Don't waste your time and effort on someone who won't put in the time and effort for you. They might be the best person in the world, but they're not for you if they don't love you in the way that you want and need. "
"Pillows with writing on them, they always say something stupid like *believe* or *dreamy* in an ugly ~ whimsical ~ font. "
"I was at a party with my SO and my friend started hitting on him very obviously: touching him casually, giving him compliments, asking him to make her drink (‚Äúoh, you‚Äôre so good, I will keep you close for the refills all night‚Äù). 
She wasn‚Äôt being mean toward me, she had never met him. When I approached after I finished a conversation her jaw dropped: ‚ÄúOh, you know each other?... Oh, he‚Äôs your boyfriend...‚Äù. She was really disappointed. 
I had to explain this to my SO and to convince him, he wouldn‚Äôt even believe me"
"You don't have to share every interest and hobby, but respecting your partners interests and hobbies is vital. You can be supportive without participating and showing a little interest won't kill you. "
"Guys who are excessively into sports. Like plans their schedule around whenever their team is playing, or gets in a legitimately bad mood after their team loses.

That, and liking Big Bang Theory or Nickelback."
Women do not pee out of our vaginas. Seriously. 
"I get a lot of hate for this in my industry, but funerals.

I work in a low cost facility and you can get the exact same stuff, with way better service because I'm gifted af with restorative art, for a fraction of the cost.  When people tell me about services at other facilities and how the body looked like shit I just shake my head, because I know I could have done better and they would have been way happier.

But people are scared of my side of town and you say low cost and people hear trashy and ghetto.

One of the local big chains around here, I went to a personal funeral last week and they gave her a horse face and over waxed her lips.  On a 13 grand funeral.  And tied up her tits too high.  She's 80, they shouldn't be in her throat.  

I could rant about this all day so I'll just stop here. "
"SO and I were walking around some shops in Vegas. Stopped in a clothing store where we were greeted by 2 female sales associates who saw us walk in holding hands. One approaches my SO and says hello. As they‚Äôre chatting I split off to check out the rest of the store. I can hear my SO‚Äôs voice and loud female laughter coming from their direction. I eventually make my way back around to them and my SO turns to me and says ‚ÄúBabe, wanna go to a party tonight?? These girls just invited us!‚Äù to which one of them replied (only looking at him) ‚ÄúWell...just you. And your guy friends.‚Äù"

don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm
"Oh I had completely given up. Everyone I dated was a disaster. Half of them seemed unable to hold down a job, half of them were emotionally unstable and sent up red flags, and half of them were long distance relationships that could never come to fruition. (""But those are three halves!"" you say. Yes. They overlap in several places.) I moved cross country to restart my life and I dated two people who were frosty-cold and emotionally unavailable. I joined Match.com, my first paid dating site subscription, and gave myself a three month limit. If nothing interesting bit after three months, I was done, and I was content with my lot in life as a cat lady.

A few weeks after I set up my profile, and several very boring and/or rude individuals later (""Y NO NUDES"" or ""I want to be a docile stay at home daddy to those kids you mention not wanting to have""), a guy messaged me and just told me I was very pretty and that he wanted to buy me coffee and chat. That was it. No dick pics. No insinuation that I should incubate his babies ASAP. Nothing. Just a compliment and an invitation. His profile was kinda dry and he took a bad selfie so he looked like a thumb wearing a bow tie, but he was so nice, so I gave it a shot.

He turned out to be much more interesting and cuter in person. Four months later I was diagnosed with stage IV endometrial cancer and told him he didn't have to stay, but he did, and supported me every step of the way through surgery and chemo. Now I'm in remission, our wedding is in July, and I really need to send out our save the dates already. But I'm still a cat lady. Turns out he makes a good cat daddy."
She sure sounds like a catch lmao
Couches with low backs. You can't even relax on those things. 
"Most women will not get off from penetration alone, which is completely normal. "
If you wear transitions glasses (the glasses that change from clear to shaded in sunlight). I hate them. I don't know if it would completely put me off a person but it would definitely kill any initial reaction. 
"Sorry, can't resist answering this one.  Peak health and youth,  everyone around them stays happy and healthy as they wither away.  Bonus, once people figured it out they wouldn't get a moment's rest."
Any of those detox teas like flat tummy tea and etc. they‚Äôre just laxatives and probably do more harm to your body than good. your kidney and liver detoxes just fine.
"No normally women hit him over the head with how obvious they are. Poor guys never once asked someone out, women -including me- have always pursued him. 

My favorite, that I sadly wasn‚Äôt there for, was a woman in her 40s at the grocery store. She told him ‚Äúyou know, older women know it won‚Äôt break‚Äù

He goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think my fianc√©e would appreciate that‚Äù

She goes ‚Äúwell call her, maybe she can come too‚Äù

He said the worst part is she had her kids with her and the oldest DEFINITELY knew what was going on. That parts sad. But the other stuff makes me lol "
"I‚Äôd only ever consider men who breathe and have a pulse. What can I say, I‚Äôm picky."
"I thought it'd be funny to get the word ""POOP"" on the bathroom wall because this girl I knew had ""EAT"" in her kitchen. I never did follow through though."
"Does it count if we eventually landed the one that got away only to then realize they were a bullet that we were kind of unable to dodge?

I worked at a fast food joint in high school and had a crush on one of my coworkers. We became really good friends. We hung out a ton. Then one night we were watching movies and he kissed me. 

We never did anything about it, though. Eventually I moved to college, he joined the military, he got married, I got a degree. But we bumped into each other about two years after I graduated college. He was getting divorced. So we figured, ""Hey, let's finally do this!"" 

He was a pretty crappy person. We had nothing in common. He stole a dog. He got me pregnant. I broke up with him by telling him I wanted an abortion and to never see him again after it. "
"Finally, a real question "
He took me on a date to a restaurant that he regulars. The waitress only talked to him. Even when I was ordering she only looked at him. It was like I wasn't even there. After we left and I told him that she liked him and it took a lot of convincing until he believed me.
"Expensive moisturizers that claim to get rid of wrinkles. Like if you really want to get rid of wrinkles, get a face lift. There isn't a magic cream that's going to do that, no matter if you pay $300 for it or not.

"As often as you need/want to.  Some people get dry skin if they shower too much, while other people are perfectly fine showering twice a day.  Some people like to wash their hair every time they shower, while other people only wash their hair once a week or less.  There's no right or wrong way to do it, as long as you don't stink."
I tell my cat many many times a day. 
"OTC medicine! I don't know if this is a specific to the UK thing or not but if you're shelling out for the brand names on things like paracetamol and ibuprofen rather than buying the 20p packs from the supermarket you're a mug. Exact same thing.

Vaginas don't permanently stretch out or become loose because of sex. 
"- What periods are and how the cycle works - including hormone changes which links into how most birth control works. 

- That the urethra exists and is a separate hole.

- That the hymen can come in many forms and should not break, tear or be painful during sex when treated with respect. 

- On that note, that sex/penetration of any kind shouldn‚Äôt be painful if done correctly and to seek medical opinions if it is. 

- Discharge is a thing. It‚Äôs weird and sticky and changes over the month, will ruin your underwear, and shouldn‚Äôt be mistaken as a sign of arousal/being wet. 

- The clitoris is a fucking huge interior organ, not a tiny little button.

- The vagina is just one part of the vulva. They are not the same thing.

- Labia come in all shapes and sizes, none of which are abnormal or wrong.

- Everyone should have a better understanding of how breast/bra sizing works

"Saying ""I don't dance"" 

I'm okay with ""I don't feel like dancing right now"" or ""I never learned how, so I feel awkward doing it"" or ""Some sort of physical condition makes dancing painful"" - hell, I'm fine with ""My dancing looks like a flailing chicken so I'd rather not in public"" 

But flat refusing to dance at all, even in private, just because? Not even a hip wiggle or bouncing to the beat? Nah, get out of here. You gotta get jiggy with it to get jiggy with me"
HONESTLY Reddit has made me a lot more wary of men in general. It‚Äôs not doing your sex a lot of favors.

"I read a lot of McMansion Hell and watch a lot of HGTV so I'm basically an expert in interior design!!! (I am not an expert in interior design)

So, I love old homes. I hate putting carpeting over perfectly good hardwood floors in said old homes. I hate carpeting in general.

I hate beige. Just absolutely sick of it.

I don't understand putting like 60,000 tiny pillows on a couch or a bed."
Bad shoes. Cannot fuck a man who wears New Balances to a restaurant.
"Vaginal discharge. For over a year, I thought my perfectly normal vaginal discharge was a sign of a long-lasting yeast infection. 

Nope. If I'm excreting white, stringy 'mucus' (or whatever the fuck it is) that doesn't burn or itch, I'm a-okay."
"This was a couple of years ago. My boyfriend was trying to choke me. Apparently, I'm an awful human being and deserved it. This guy had already pulled a knife on me once and tried to shoot my dog. He was fairly unsuccessful at strangling me that night, having broken his hand punching apart my furniture. 

Eventually, i talked my way out of it. I really dont know how. I ran. I grabbed my dog and ran like hell. I still have nightmares about it. It's had an effect on how I deal with personal stress. I don't enjoy panic attacks. They're awful. I'm dealing with it though.

I've moved about a thousand miles away from him. I still jump when I see a truck that looks like his. It's getting easier. 

It's changed the things I'm afraid of. I went on a backpacking trip this summer. We were briefly lost in the wilderness. I fell off a log bridge into an icy creek. A bear sniffed me through our tent. (Alaska problems!) There was some other stuff like rock slides and Grizzly kill. That trip was an adventure. It was also an epic disaster.

And it was far less scary than that moment where someone I loved was trying to choke the life out of me. There will never be anything as scary as the way he was looking at me. 

It's Christmas. I'm a tiny bit full of whiskey with a small black dog sleeping on me. He's half pug. Hes snoring and farting like a champ. My dog is alive. I'm alive. I'm grateful. Every day that I'm still here is such a gift. I still have flashbacks, but I am so incredibly happy to be here at all. I honestly believe surviving that has improved my life."
Love is not enough. There are so many other things that are necessary for a successful relationship.
"The amount of fully grown, sexually active men and women who don't know this is shocking.

"I‚Äôve been in the Army for 9.5 years; military police in a combat support unit. I‚Äôm one 1 of 2 women in the unit. 

My experience has been overwhelmingly positive, but I had strong female leadership in basic training which I believe set me up for success. I‚Äôve always maintained my physical fitness and passed my annual PT tests, I‚Äôve always made sure I‚Äôm proficient with my weapons (I‚Äôve cycled through carrying an M4 and M249, and always had an M9 side arm as an MP). One of the biggest complaints from male soldiers (that I‚Äôve heard personally) is having to do pick up the slack for women who can‚Äôt be assed to learn the essential functions of their job.

I‚Äôve never been sexually harassed, sexually assaulted, or even threatened.. but I have been discriminated against in terms of leadership being the only female, they felt it would be ‚Äúdifficult,‚Äù for me to pass on information adequately because the males were all in the barracks together.. so that was an obstacle out of my control that I had to work extra hard to prove myself in that regard. 

I‚Äôve made sure not to mix ‚Äúbusiness with pleasure,‚Äù and stayed away from developing romantic relationships with my co-workers - men get high fives for ‚Äúsmashing,‚Äù and women get shamed for being easy, the sexism double standard regarding sex in the military is blown way out of proportion compared to civilian life.

I‚Äôd be more happy to answer any specific questions you have if this wasn‚Äôt the answer you were looking for!"
"this may be a bit meta, but the overriding concept that minimalism is all white/black furniture with a sheepskin throw here and there needs to die. minimalism can look any type of way you want it to. imo it just means being conscientious and deliberate about what you own. but whatever style of decor a person likes can be applied to minimalism.

I say ""blech"" now because one day I finally moved back home. And slowly discovered that he liked the off-and-on long distance thing because he was fucking *allergic* to any form of committment. Refused to call me his girlfriend for years, cheated anytime he was given a chance, all that jazz. Turns out, he had ""gotten away"" for years because he *wanted* to be away.

"They need way more educating about periods.

"Some of the things that make it worse (for me) are- 

He was the smartest person I‚Äôd ever met. His big bro went to MIT and was really intelligent, but his mom always said he was her smartest because he never had to try. He was just gifted. When he was arrested and sent to prison he had a 4.0 and 1 semester left. 

The night I found him high, he told me some girl was pregnant and it might be his. He lies for attention so I told his mom, but didn‚Äôt believe him. That same night, when we were waiting for the ambulance, he was shoving pills down his throat and I was trying to stop him. He was crying and I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I called my grandma (who he loves now - but had a very tumultuous relationship with when we were dating) and she told him that if he died in front of me, he may as well kill me too because it would destroy me.. he hung up the phone and laid his head in my lap and just cried and apologized. When his parents got there, he broke down in his dads arms and literally collapsed. That‚Äôs when his mom asked me to stay away from him. 

Almost a year later, I stopped by his moms house to give her a birthday gift ( he didn‚Äôt live there, we planned it, and she was like a mother to me) and there was a newborn baby in his sisters arms. I held my first loves first son and cried. I loved that baby immediately and still send things to his mother for the kid(s.. he has another now). 

March of 2016 I had a weird feeling. I tried to call him, no answer. I told my husband I was really worried but he brushed it off.. because I worry about everything. In June, I decided to google his name.. arrested the night I called him. 5 year prison sentence. I reached out to his mother and she said she regrets not listening to me, I know him better than anyone, etc.,. Since then, I‚Äôve been battling within myself on writing him. My husband is supportive, he knows me inside and out. 

This makes it a bit complex so bear with me: my now husband and I split up for two years and I dated an abusive asshole. Small town, my high school sweetheart found out that he had broken in my apartment and fractured my jaw, so he confronted him and you can guess what happened. I‚Äôm not proud, but he was the only person in my life that gave a shit about it. 

There‚Äôs more but honestly, it hurts to remember. Breaks my heart for him all over again. I hope he‚Äôs okay and turns his life around. "
An irritating voice
"I have no idea if it was his intention to murder me, but my ex strangled me and i fought back with everything in me. He finally let me go only because I was trying to take his eye out with my thumb. He caught me twice more before I finally got away, ran through the woods to some random person's house and called the cops. 

The trial was horrible. His attorney tried to make me sound like there was something wrong with me because I remember everything that happened but have no idea what he said. Like video with no audio. Ex finally pled out to only 5 years. 

I tried counseling but I never felt comfortable and the counselors just couldn't seem to grasp that most of the time I didn't exhibit the typical PTSD symptoms except the hypervigilance. I was just really goddamn angry. I still don't like to be touched without permission, particularly if I'm feeling anxious, but I'm working on it. The casual bumps and touches in crowds really take a lot out of me and I tend to avoid places with a lot of people. 

The biggest thing that helps me is practicing self care. Giving myself the time to decompress on days I need it. I had to learn to let things go undone sometimes when I need some down time and that needing that time doesn't mean there's anything wrong with me.  It's been years and I still have bad days,  but I refuse to give up and let that bastard take anything else from me."

Walked past one with a couple sitting out the front, one is talking and the other is lifting his fork to his mouth.

"I was at the dog park with my husband, but he wanted to listen to some basketball game, so I wandered off and chatted up some strangers and petted their dogs. After a bit, I look over and hubby is on a bench with his earbuds in. 

A lady our age heads over to him and I see him take out the earbuds, say something briefly, then replace them.  This repeats itself about 4-5 times, basically any time I look over. I see her put her hand on his arm and just make it obvious she was flirting from 40 yards away. 

Later, after we leave, he‚Äôs telling me, ‚ÄúThis lady kept asking me about the game. It‚Äôs weird. I guess she‚Äôs a big fan, but she didn‚Äôt really know the players or anything. And she kept interrupting when the game was getting good!‚Äù  He was completely floored when I told him she didn‚Äôt care about the game and was hitting on him. "

Seriously, though, if you lack self-worth, self-respect and feel you don't deserve love it's better to work on those issues first before getting into a relationship. You might get lucky and find a kind person who supports you but you could also find an asshole who'll hurt you. Or you could hurt the person you're with. Self-love first, baby, tons of self-love."
I pity her boyfriend.
"I escaped, he went to prison- served 8 years and was released. I bought a gun- took weapon defense classes, and sleep with it under my pillow. I sleep pretty well! "
"I was my high school boyfriend‚Äôs one who got away, and I feel the same way as you. We wouldn‚Äôt work, we had grown to be so different, it would be a disaster. He was stuck on sixteen year old me, and I‚Äôm a completely different person. He sent me a letter when I graduated college about how he still loves me and no one has ever compared and I just wrote back ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know me. You‚Äôre in love with a ghost.‚Äù 

Mutual friends report that he was furious at how flippantly I dismissed him, and that was apparently the kick in the ass he needed to move on. Told you, dude, you wouldn‚Äôt even like me these days."
"The little nagging gut feelings I had, the ones I tried to convince myself meant nothing because it would mean ending the relationship, were always right."
"To add to this: Lasting until one of you dies is not the only way a relationship can be meaningful, successful, or important. Time you spent with someone before parting ways is not ‚Äúwasted time.‚Äù You experienced life, you learned things about yourself and others, and you hopefully gave and received love and support. It makes me so sad when people completely discredit relationships that previously made them happy just because they didn‚Äôt last forever. To me it‚Äôs like saying all your previous jobs didn‚Äôt do anything for you just because you don‚Äôt work there anymore. Presumably you learned skills there, gained experience, got paid, and provided services to other people that they cared about. Even short-term, non-serious relationships often have a profound effect on people‚Äôs lives, and I hate how casually we deny that. "
"That they are wildly anxious about approaching women and in most cases just decide to not.

I then pointed out a tattoo he had forgotten to explain and she looked a bit annoyed at me. After me and my SO chit chatted about when he got it done she realised I must spend quite a bit of time with him and had this horrified look on her face and asked ""Are you two...together?"" and when we said yes she apologised profusely and I honestly had to take a moment to understand what she was apologising about before I understood she'd been planning to get it on with him.

"My ex had his ex girlfriend while we were dating and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to tell me. We started dating when he was 26 and I 17. The first time he was supposed to meet my parents he was too hungover to show. I was a freshman in college. I was convinced he was the one and understandably devastated when he graduated and moved home to be near his kid. We broke up. 

He went on to get a teaching job for a high school. Had a 2nd kid with another woman and married her. His parents babied him and supported him well into his 30s and he still lived with them. Now he is in prison for exchanging nudes over a period of a month with his.... 17 year old student. He continued to harass me with phone calls and letters from prison up until a few months ago. When I didnt respond he‚Äôd make his mother or other friends reach out to me on Facebook. Ended up having to call the prison warden to get  it to stop. Needless to say I learned a lot and pursue much healthier relationships these days. "

"The risks and issues and side effects and logistics of how The Pill works. Saying ""just go on the Pill!"" is really oversimplified since there are many many types, not all women can take it, many don't want to, and that eliminating your natural menstrual cycle comes with a LOT of changes in mood, libido,  attraction, medical issues. It's not a small decision and I wish more people knew how it works to prevent pregnancy. 

Not wanting to be on hormonal birth control is 100% valid, and there are effective methods for couple that are not hormonal. It should be a 2-way thing"
"* Heart attack symptoms tend to look different in men than women. The stereotype of dramatic, acute chest/arm pain that you see in movies mostly applies to men. Women's symptoms are often much more subtle.

- Penis-in-vagina intercourse doesn't/can't lead to orgasm for most women -- there's nothing -wrong- with either of you if this doesn't happen. While vaginal stimulation feels good for many women, clitoral stimulation is usually necessary for orgasm to happen. 

* The clitoris is the most sensitive part of the female body and has many times more nerve endings than the head of the penis. Generally speaking, the motion you use when you touch it should not in any way resemble digging for treasure.

* Vaginas, like penises, expand length- and widthwise when they're aroused. If a woman's vagina is so ""tight"" that you're having troubling entering her, she's probably just not turned on yet.

* On that note, women tend to take significantly longer to reach full sexual arousal than men do. Foreplay is important -- not being wet after two minutes of kissing is *normal*! Don't just jam it in. Turn her on first!

* Women metabolize alcohol differently than men do. Women will be more strongly affected by the same amount of alcohol as a man of the same size. 

* Women are much more prone to a number of (unisex) illnesses than men are, including depression, hypothyroidism, eating disorders, and urinary tract infections. "
"stretchy clear, thin mucus = fertile (not as harsh for sperm in both ph and moevement). if you can stretch it between your fingers and it looks almost like non-frothy spit, chances are it's that kind of mucus.

thick opaque, whitish mucus = less fertile. it tends to come before and after ovulation, it's not an ideal medium for sperm movement, and tends to be more acidic (it's the mucus that's more likely to bleach your black underwear) "
"Dated. He ""cheated"" (he told me he was exclusive with me even though I didnt care) with who knows how many people. I didn't care. It only annoyed me because he would lie all the time to try and make me think he was boyfriend material. No dude, stfu, I just wanted to go dancing and get faded and laid, relax Romeo.

He wasn't and never will be partner material. He was a broken record. Cheated on every gf he ever had, multiple times. Games, so many games. But I did enjoy our time together. Wish he hadn't tried to play me while I was so willing to just have a good time.

I keep in touch with people in his circle and he's still doing the same shit at almost 40, bald, and not nearly as attractive as he thinks he is (he used to be, but hard living ages you). He got some girl pregnant and his live in gf was livid... which is hilarious since she tried to steal him from his last gf and seemed cool with cheating then. 

People like that just live in their own melodramas. It's not fun unless it's exciting and dangerous and messy. It's exhausting."
"Depends on your activity level. If you feel gross or start to smell, take a shower. I take one every day to every other day."
"Mostly it was boring. With a lot of downtime. Day to day was basically...

Woke up super early to sweep, mop and clean the toilet and sink.
Either went back to sleep or ate breakfast.
Went back to the cell for an hour.
Went to the common area.
School.
Lunch.
Back to school.
Cell for an hour.
Went to the common area.
Back to cell.
Dinner.
Back to cell.
Hung out in common area till bedtime. (Between 8-10 depending on how you behaved) The lights never went out, they dimmed.

No fighting, or drama. At most there was five girls there, the least was just me. (Was there for about three months) The boys were packed though. Two, to a room and at one point they had cots setup in the gym. 

Most of the CO's were nice. The morning woman would sometimes sneak breakfast into my cell do I wouldn't have to get up. When I was the only girl, I was given Dunkin donuts. Another CO fought to get us hair products. 

Because there weren't many girls, we got to shower alone (with no other girls. The CO stood at the door when we got razers.)

Had some entertainment from one of the boys, we'd leave notes under the tables, or on the computer in school. But besides going to court we never talked to them.

Did a lot of reading, and took the end of course tests so I ended up ahead when I went back to school. 

Food wasn't good, it was made at the adult prison. And had literally four pieces of bread with every meal. They don't force you to eat unless you go too long without. I'd often skip breakfast or lunch. 

Sometimes parents would bring in food for someone's birthday. My mom brought a bunch of candy for mine, which I was allowed to bring back to my cell with me. (Asked to give it to the previously mentioned boy, but was given it back when they found a hidden note in it! Lol)

Like the other person said no writing utensils (in our cells at least) we had access to them while in the common area as well as school. We were given journals to write or doodle in. 

Not sure what else to comment on. If you have any more specific questions, I'd be happy to answer.

"as a guy, this. after taking basic anatomy and physiology in college, I realized some of what ya'll have to deal with. and listening to how other guys talk, they don't have a clue. I heard an adult radio personality - who's married, has two daughters, criticize his female coworker for leaving a tampon wrapper in the bathroom trashcan - live on the radio - even though it was just the clean wrapper - he thought she should take it with her so he didn't have to see it. and that's just the tip of the iceberg of what ya'll have to deal with. I know some women don't want to talk about it, but guys need to know and just get over it"
"There isn't really a single defined way I can say I ""got over it."" It's really just a matter of time.

I left and he moved on to a new victim. When he almost killed her he was arrested because he stabbed one of the cops who came to get him. He only served 6 months for that which I think is fucking shameful in the eyes of the American justice system considering he had a prior violent record. And considering that people caught with weed get years and years in federal prison...

I slept more soundly for those 6 months than I have in the rest of the past 4 years.

I slept very poorly after I found out about his release.

I had continual nightmares about him last month because the last time I had to deal with him was around Thanksgiving 4 years ago. Going forward I hope that holiday is not a stress/ PTSD trigger for me in years to come, but apparently I have no say in what my brain does.

I sleep okay now. I feel safe in my home but if I'm home alone (rare) I don't go to sleep until the sun comes up because if he finds out where I live and decides to attack I want to be awake and aware and prepared to kill, and I know he won't come for me if it's daylight.

On a day to day basis, I don't really think about it anymore. I know that once I move away from the town where we both lived together I will finally feel safe. But ""just move"" isn't as easy as people like to make it sound."

Also I want to be able to just leave the window open.

"His dog literally thinks the sun shines out of his ass. Like, she‚Äôs a very well-behaved dog that adores people, but she will ignore the fuck out of everyone else if my SO so much as looks at her. Pets from him are superior to pets from anyone else. She will abandon full-on afternoon nap snuggles from me to go greet him at the door (but not the other way around). She‚Äôll run away from anyone (new person, old person, person giving her treats) to him if he calls her. Hell, she will passively let him take food literally out of her mouth (he‚Äôs done this when she gobbled up stuff with onions in it before) and runs the hell away when I try to get that stuff away from her. It‚Äôs an abnormal level of love, even for a dog.

Oh, and it‚Äôs not just his dog. Other peoples‚Äô dogs love him, too. Like he stays with friends and their dogs want to sleep in his room instead of their owners‚Äô. A couple we know has a really . . . temperamental dog. It‚Äôs a rescue with massive anxiety issues that distrusts new people and the owners give anyone who visits their house this whole primer on how to interact with their dog. *That* dog adores him and constantly sits on his feet. (Meanwhile it snarled at me once because after a few visits I tried to pet it *while it was sitting in his feet*.)

TLDR: Dogs LOVE him.

He got another girl pregnant within a month of our break up, got into hard drugs, openly cheated on all of his next girlfriends and was accused of raping several girls before 22.

Seriously a great typo. I‚Äôve got a whole image in my head of what a mercy table is now. 
My older half brother (given up for adoption) was able to get in contact with us because he took the Ancestry.com one. It somehow matched him with my great aunt who figured out who he was and put him in contact with my dad.

"A couple times a week. He tells me even less. With my ex it was constant I love yous and I realized that saying it more doesn‚Äôt make it more true. 

So now, I say it when I feel the need to, and he does the same. And when he says it to me, I know he really means it and in that moment he is thinking about how much he loves me. It‚Äôs not a habit and it‚Äôs not forced. 

It‚Äôs much more important to show love. I know he loves me because he takes care of me, and I do the same for him. 

But anyway this is just what works for us. My ex used to say it to me constantly and if I didn‚Äôt say it back right away he would say it again but almost like a question. Like he needed me to say it back. And I would get so annoyed. I just felt like if I‚Äôve already said it to you three times today, why do I need to say it again?  "

My SO and I went to get coffee one morning in college and the barista was into him. She was flirting with him pretty obviously and gave him an extra shot of espresso for free and he had NO idea that he was being flirted with. It was really cute. 
"haha! My friend used to date a guy we called ""New Balance Barry."" He was attractive, but the shoes knocked him down a few pegs."

"That we have to be NICE all the time.

On that note, I find it infuriating that I can't just say 'no' to something without being questioned. Men especially tend to look astounded if you say it firmly with no attached explanation or excuse."
"My absolute favorite quote ever: 

&gt;Do not kill when you can wound. Do not wound when you can subdue. Do not subdue when you can pacify. But do not raise your hand at all unless you have first extended it.

I quote this to myself whenever I get into a confrontation. WW seems to have found a reasonable medium between being a doormat and being an asshole. "

"I was pretty damn in love with a guy for six years and thought that I‚Äôd never find anyone that I could feel the same way about ever again. I pretty much gave up and had the ‚Äúsomeday we will reunite because it‚Äôs meant to be‚Äù mentality. 

Then about a month after I hit rock bottom with how much I missed him and hating myself for fucking it up, I met a lovely, charming, beautiful guy. I don‚Äôt really believe in love at first sight but there was definitely an ‚Äúoh fuck‚Äù at first sight. 
 
Ever since then I haven‚Äôt really thought about the first guy. I am so in love. It is scary how blinded you can be by someone not meant for you and that possibility of missing out on someone even greater. "
"I ""dated"" him when I was 13 and he was almost 18.  Of course, being the na√Øve tween I was, I imagined we were so super in love and an epic romance for the ages.  I probably was more clingy than he wanted seeing as how I was a child and he was my first ""real"" boyfriend, but the worst I ever did was call him twice in a row in case he missed it the first time (this was back when caller ID was an additional paid service that no one I knew had).  We ended up breaking up when he decided he wanted to date a friend of mine.  

Anyway, I didn't find out until I was 20 that he'd been talking about me ever since.  Apparently everyone who knew him thought I was batshit insane and obsessed with him.  I found out when he was hanging out with my then-boyfriend.  He convinced my now-ex that he could just call me up on a whim and I'd just break up with whoever I was dating to be with him, and then *actually called me* to prove it.  I barely even remembered him by then, hadn't spoken to him in more than half a decade.  I think--or at least I *hope*--it was a major blow to his ego when I told him he was a fucking creep and to not call me again.  I don't know what the hell he was thinking."
"I didn't have a big part in handling my mother's funeral since I was 15 at the time, but my father asked for my input regarding casket, I got to pick out a flower bouquet, etc. Even at the time I was astounded at the costs. When we were casket shopping, the guy was saying how we should go for such and such upgraded unit because it would last longer underground and not succumb to rot like these cheaper caskets which let moisture in.. in retrospect in was all bullshit but probably a lot can be gotten away with when you're dealing with people in extreme grief. It's shameful!"
Start a fire for a man and he‚Äôll be warm for a day; set him on fire and he‚Äôll be warm for the rest of his life.
I can't believe this was *grounds* for breaking up.
"Shallow? Height. I've had too many short male acquaintances who have ego issues. 

It's kind of like the jerks throughout school. You remember their names and could never use them for kids or even pets. "
Allergic to cats or dogs. I cannot live the rest of my life without pets. It would bring me too much unhappiness and eventually cause a rift in the relationship. I also have small dreams of owning my own doggy daycamp one day. 
"Closure is an internal process, not something that someone else can give you, not really. Closure is what happens when you accept, fully, that the relationship is over, and when you understand what you are able to understand and accept that the stuff you don‚Äôt understand doesn‚Äôt fundamentally matter. Seeking closure from an ex isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúseeking closure,‚Äù it‚Äôs preventing yourself from reaching that point of total acceptance. "
"Just like...be aware of your influence on the people/world around you. 

If your roommate has just tidied up the living room, don't dump all your crap on the floor and leave it there. 

Step away from the elevator doors in case someone needs to get off first. Don't just barrel in without looking. Same applies to buses. Let people get off the damn bus before you rush in.

When you're at the store and you need to stop to look at something, pull your shopping cart to the side of the aisle so people can get past you. 

Speaking of shopping carts, just put them in the cart corral. It's not that hard. 

Throw your garbage away. Don't just leave it wherever and expect someone else to clean it up. Especially in public places. 

Look cashiers in the eye and return their greetings to you. 

Basic traffic laws apply to parking lots. Stop cutting across parking spaces. Use your turn signal. Drive at a safe speed. Seriously guys. 

I could go on and on honestly, but it all comes down to doing little things that might make someone else's life a bit easier and more pleasant. If we all did this, there might be a little less stress in the world. "
"My husband is super understanding. My ex never did anything to threaten our relationship and we‚Äôve had no contact since getting married. My husband knows the whole story and has encouraged my relationship with ex‚Äôs mother and has spoken with me about writing him and helping out anyway we can when he gets out. I don‚Äôt think my ex is still in love with me by any means, I just think his mental health was already fragile and our break up exasperated it and he‚Äôs had a hard time getting back. I think ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù plays a big roll in my ex‚Äôs issues as well. He had everything, now he‚Äôs in prison... 

My husband is an amazing person. "
"THIS. It‚Äôs sad, but so many people- women included- don‚Äôt realize women have three separate holes down there. "
"To be fair, it's kinda hard to see the difference between a barista who does well her job of being friendly to the customers, and a barista that is trying to flirt. Both would smile at you, have an open body language, and maybe use a bit of banter. Even when single, unless she's touching my arm or something, I generally avoid considering as flirting anything from someone whose job is to be nice to me"
"&gt; mercy tables

What's that?"
"Avoided eye contact until he thought I hated him. His face is just so cute, I don't want to get caught staring.

Yay."
Don't be too grateful for someone liking you. Think a bit about what you think of them.
"Eh if you‚Äôre in crisis mode I sort of understand this. Sure, it‚Äôs silly to pay more for Tylenol over generic paracetamol, but if you‚Äôre freaking out about a possible unplanned pregnancy I can see why you‚Äôd want the name you‚Äôve heard about. "

"My HS/College bf. We dated for over 6 years, talked about getting married and where we wanted to live and about kids, the whole shebang.  We broke up once because he cheated on me with a girl we both knew. I was devastated and spent hours on the phone with my mom wondering if we would get back together and drive my roommate absolutely crazy. Looking back I would have been beyond annoyed too. A couple months later we wound up getting back together on my birthday after laying on his bed, both still half drunk, and him telling me that he missed what we had and then sleeping together that same night. 
After that though it never really felt the same but I was just so happy to be back together I just shoved it aside. We lasted another year and a half when a couple months before he graduated college he broke up with me, tried to do it over IM before I finally got him to come over and talk in person. There I was a Bawling snotting mess and he just walked out like it was nothing. He came back over a couple times in the months after but nothing ever happened, think he just felt sorry for me. Last time I saw him or talked to him was at a dinner right after his grad ceremony with his parents and friends. 
Got super depressed and dropped out of school and wound up Moving to a new city to get away from the bad memories. Messed me up for dating for a long, long time.
Anyway I saw a picture of him a few years back on Facebook since we still have a couple mutual friends. Holy neck beard Batman!  He is a full on fedora wearing, obnoxious know it all neck beard. He‚Äôs like their king I swear. All I could do was laugh myself silly at the fact that this was the same  person I was gutted over years before.  I look back now at how awful he was a lot of the time and how young and naive I was to deal with it. I was never smart enough for him and never good enough for his family and his untreated bipolar disorder was so stressful to deal with. I was crushed at the time but eventually I saw I Majorly dodged a bullet there"
"I fell for my best friend but I was with someone else. It killed me inside to have to stop being friends with him because we both had such strong feelings for each other. 



A few years later I had broken up the guy I was with at the time and mall friend and I started sleeping together. All he did was mess me around, manipulate me and secretly kept me as his side piece while he was with a girlfriend I didn't know about. 



Shut that shit down and never spoke to him again. "
"I can't decide if I want to watch Love Actually, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Grinch, or the Muppets Christmas Carol. "
"My SO is a charming fellow.. He's also extremely oblivious to being flirted with or hit on.  A few years ago, we were visiting his family back East.  A neighbor family (who was active in his their lives growing up) invited all of us  to a nice big dinner. We get there and the Mom of the household is extremely happy to see him.. Dinner starts.. She starts talking about how handsome he is all grown up (this is the entire topic of conversation).  At some point, her husband leaves the table to put their youngest to bed (he seemed uncomfortable).. My SOs sisters are looking at me every now and again to see if I'm reacting to this at all. Eventually this woman starts talking about his previous girlfriends and how he was handsome when he did yard work and etc. In my mind, I'm wondering if my SO had some weird college/neighbor mom fling with this lady because it's just odd.  Once it was time for goodbyes, she made her way to him first.. He's still oblivious.  His sister, Mom, and I are not oblivious.. so we start the walk home and they started dying of laughter.. he didn't realize how awkward it had become.  I don't get particularly jealous.. but it was definitely an awkward few hours."
I think they meant she never got a cookie from her parents even before juvie. Like getting a cooking in juvie was the best thing that ever happened to her.
"My married friend always says to evaluate the cost of being right.  Is it worth it?  Because sometimes letting go of the argument and being ""wrong"" helps the marriage move forward, and therefore it's not worth being ""right"" because it stalls the relationship and causes road blocks.  Essentially you have to look at the big picture and not get caught up in the little road bumps."
"The names my boyfriend used for his grandparents.

 My family was never very inventive with nicknames (I call my mother... mother). My boyfriend once got off the phone with his grandfather and said, ""Poppies and Mom Mom say hello."" I literally stopped in my tracks and was overwhelmed by how casual and cute he was."
"First love, we were kept apart by social politics (mine) and I always wondered if it would have been worth it.

Yep. Bullet dodged."
"Guys who are goody two-shoes. I can‚Äôt really describe it better than: someone who is terrified of breaking the rules. It‚Äôs a little emasculating for me.

"That for a lot of men, there is nothing worse than when someone bucks social norms.

"i always *knew*. the real work was in soul-searching to discover why i tolerated being treated poorly.

it was some weird of inverted narcissism (''if i date someone *like that*, they'll *have* to treat me right!''), and when this loser didn't love me, i stuck around trying to prove him wrong, because the alternative meant being so awful that even someone *like that* couldn't love me.

yeah. messed up. and they realize how messed up you are and how full of shit you are, so they'll never turn around and give you what you supposedly want. it's hard to love someone who has no self respect."

"The emotional, in-love part of me who is married to my best buddy with the same hangups/ values/ goals, is a good roommate, my fuck buddy, my confidant, my friend had/ has 0 doubts.

The accountant who deals with nasty divorces and inheritance issues and alimony daily refuses to believe that I'm exempt from divorce.

Do I think we'll divorce? No. But very very few people go into it thinking that they will. It was important to me to discuss what could/ would/ should split us up - infidelity? lies about money? addiction with the refusal to get help? taking out an extra credit card? getting a hobby that I/ he finds immoral? inability/ disinterest to have sex? ALLLLL these things I've seen people divorce over, and I think that talking candidly about it, and being in the position to walk away if I need to (or him to, too) makes a stronger union, because it's based on more than ""we love each other."" Which we do, I'm not saying that we don't, but love is not enough, and only by honing into those doubts could I eradicate doubts. 

So, yes. I have/had doubts. NOT because of my specific marriage or spouse, but marriage and human nature and emotional stability more generally. I work and hope and think to ensure that we won't be part of the 50% of divorce, but I think it's naive to not consider it as a possibility "

"I enjoyed it for what it was but I don't think it was great.

The whole Finn/Rose adventure which took up half of the movie was pretty pointless. Not a fan of Rose. It seems very forced. The whole casino bit and the sudden ""but look at the slavery!"" scene was really random. 

It bothers me a bit that Rey is so awesome at everything with zero training. Luke trained forever, Anakin trained but now suddenly Rey can do it all? Maybe I'm missing something but it just seems really bizarre to me. I'm guessing she's going to basically be a grey Jedi by the looks of it. 

I think maybe there is too much silliness in it. It takes away from the movie at some points.

Im still looking forward to the next movie, but I think my expectations are just a little lowered and I'll just enjoy it for what it is.

"Hair Stylist here. Shampoos and conditioners that are salon quality are much different than grocery store products. Salon products tend to be in smaller packaging, because they are not watered down, they are more concentrated. Budget products are usually larger, with water mixed in, increasing the size to appear better in a price/oz situation.  Salon products also tend to have a 12 month shelf life. This decreases the amount of parabins that are used as preservatives, which allow a grocery store products to sit in a shelf for a few years and can be stored in hot temps and won't go rancid. Nicer shampoos with sulfates(soaping agents) (not *all* sulfates are bad!) will have milder sulfates, cleansing the hair without stripping color and as much natural oils, and is less harsh than cheaper sulfates in less expensive shampoos. Cheaper conditioners tend to have waxs and ingredients that will make the hair feel slick and smooth in the short term, but will always start to build up and leave hair lifeless, lank, appear greasy, and coated! As soon as someone is laying in the shampoo bowl with wet hair, I can feel if they use cheap products. The hair feels coated and thick. When it gets really bad, it causes hair color to not work as well/as anticipated and doesn't hold curls."

For instance if you love each other completely but one of you wants kids and one of your doesn't then it's not going to work. If you love each other completely and one of you has a job that forces the family to travel constantly and your spouse isn't up for that it's not going to work.

"&gt; what is your experience with (the) other women in the army?

It's hit or miss. If you're attractive, there are women who will give you a hard time purely out of jealousy, especially if you're given male attention for being attractive (even if you never become romantic). Other women are true battle buddies and will have your back no matter what and since you're female and you go through the same struggles, you stick together.

I've woken up in the middle of the night to drive drunk soldiers home from the bar so they didn't get a DUI, I work with my soldiers on their PT on my own time (after work, weekends).

"I was deep in puppy love with this senior in my co-ed fraternity when I first joined as a sophomore. I was heartbroken when he broke things off after a couple dates. I did everything wrong afterward, like continue sleeping with him and put off sleep and studying for just one additional moment of his attention. When my infatuation eventually wore off I was able to see him for how he really was: a deeply-flawed, immature, smoke-weed-everyday type that I would have hated to have gotten serious with."

The look on her face when I came over with his drink and sat on his knee, like she had a chance with my husband and I spoiled it for her.

"The same problems you might face as a 16 year old. I think the only difference is you have the maturity to learn the lessons much quicker and move on with your life. 

1. Dating someone simply because they like you, with no introspection as to whether you actually like them in return and want to date them. Lesson learned very quickly, one should be discerning when choosing SOs. 

2. Falling madly, stupidly, in love WAY too fast. This lesson was most painful. When the guy dumped me to go back to his ex, even though we'd only been dating like 4 or 5 months, I was a pathetic blubbering mess for weeks. This isn't a race, its OK to take your time and get to know the person. Guard your heart a bit.  

Within a year of trying the whole dating thing for the first time, I found a guy I connected with, I asked him out, we've now been happily together for 5 years. "
"I love this trend, but I love it *in offices and waiting rooms*.  It is way less awkward to sit on the same sofa as a stranger when that stranger isn't, like, lounging luxuriously into the fluffy sofa."
"When I was a kid, no one actually had showers in their houses. They didn't exist. We would wash at the sink, and have a bath about once a week.

Loads of people in the world don't have access to that much water, so are very frugal in their washing.

So I don't think it is *should* as much as how much you want to. Mind you, there must come a point when you become a bit biohazardous."
"No, that also depends on your product use, skin type, activity level, etc."

"Secretly shallowest dealbreaker is really thin lips. I think it‚Äôs more about me than them though. 

I have quite full lips and I always feel like kissing them will be awkward or our lips won‚Äôt fit well or something. It‚Äôs just a weird aversion I have in my head that probably isn‚Äôt even true IRL but I‚Äôve never tested it. "
"Actually that's here already, haha! I just saw it recently, I can't remember what the word or phrase was, but they were those pillows where you can wipe your hand across it and the texture changes, and there was an ""offensive"" word revealed in the new texture. I'm blanking out on what the material is called, blah. "
"I kissed a friend the morning after a night out. We were hungover dozing on his sofa (I was crashing on his sofa anyway) and it just seemed very natural. He was talking about a museum he really likes and all I could think was ""I need to kiss this man. Right now.""

We spent most of the day hanging out with some friends before I got the train back to my city. The next day I realised I hadn't actually asked him if he wanted to, you know, date. So I fired off a quick message which I think read something like ""hey sidebar are we dating now because that would be super cool if we did ok thanks"" and somehow that worked.

It's now been a few months and I'm ridiculously happy so I guess it worked out."
That they must have a difficult time dating bisexuals. 
"Haha, I have more!! How about the time we got an apartment together and our roommate told him she was too shy to say anything before, but she thinks she‚Äôs in love with him and she doesn‚Äôt want him to move into the apartment with me, but to stay living in the roommate situation and give her a chance?

Or my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who got his number off his Facebook profile (he was dumb and had that information out there) and offered to take him to the drive-in theater (surprisingly, we still have one of those in our part of the state) for a ‚Äúgood time‚Äù if he wouldn‚Äôt tell me? Yaaa, he picked me up and handed me his phone so I could see the texts and stop being friends with her.

Or my other ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who begged him to sleep with her while I was on a family vacation?

I initially thought all of this was suspicious and maybe he was initiating these interactions... but was able to triangulate mutual friends into helping me discover that these girls were all just bat-shit crazy. They were ALL co-workers, so work was incredibly uncomfortable.

So apparently, he is just extremely appealing. I don‚Äôt know. He surely drew me in. I find him very attractive personally, but I also know that he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúconventionally‚Äù attractive (not a Channing Tatum or Justin Timberlake type), so I believe that his personality, kindness, and sense of humor really draws people in. He‚Äôs very likable and knows how to make people feel comfortable and happy around him. I think when we were younger he didn‚Äôt realize that other girls mistook his friendliness and politeness as romantic interest and attention being given to them. He used to be very naive and it was kinda cute."

"It can break, telling y'all for a friend."
"I think the moment that I knew it was definitely over was when I was puking in the toilet and trying to fend my curious just-walking toddler away. He came home from work and I was so relieved, thinking thank God finally he's here and can take care of me/watch the baby. But no - the first thing he did was come up the stairs and shout at me because apparently it was my fault I was sick and now I had definitely made the baby sick too and he was mad about it.

Um. Okay."
"**Be careful who you choose to vent to about your relationship.** Outside influence can have a huge and unnecessary negative effect on your relationship. Genuinely asking for advice on a specific topic is one thing, but getting into the bad habit of whining and complaining about your SO to your friends is disrespectful, unfair, and unproductive. Your friends are already going to be unrealistically picky for you and biased towards siding with you, and now they have a one-sided emotionally-based picture of your SO (especially if you only really tell them the bad parts). 

Plus, you never know what your friends' subconscious motivations might be, and if you complain to them about your SO, it's harder to figure out who is toxic to your relationship. I've had friends encourage breakups because they were jealous that they were single and/or not engaged yet. I've had friends encourage breakups over an issue, and then I later find out that their own partners have done much worse but it's somehow okay for them."

"Any time we have a conversation over text, facebook messenger, or phone, before I go to bed, and if he's awake before I go to work in the morning.

All the time.  I want him to know I adore him.  I also call him things like ""pearl of my heart"" ""Lighthouse of security"" ""love of my life"" 

Cheesy things.

"Ours actually was a dual proposal, I proposed to him and he proposed to me one week later (I had no idea he had been planning it).

We were making sushi in our home, while listening to music. One song I had dedicated to him came up, and while I was singing and dancing, I went to our room to pick up the ring I was hiding, he didn't notice.

When the song said ""all those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me that I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life"" I got on one knee and presented the ring to him. He cried."

"I like doing nice things for people, like cooking for them, cleaning the common area, being sensitive to their emotions, etc. 

But if you're a woman doing that kind of stuff, people take advantage real quick and try to put you in the role for thankless caregiver. So it's hard to balance being nice and being mean enough not to be be taken advantage of. "

-labia minora doesn't mean these lips have to be ""minor/small."" They can extend past labia majora, be asymmetrical, smooth or wrinkly, and all sorts of colors
-darker or redder pigmentation of the labia majora is a normal sign from puberty if you've got enough melanin production in the area. It's not abnormal
-1/3 of women have nipple hair and it doesn't mean they necessarily have a hormonal imbalance
-the clitoris is both external and internal
-womens' hymens vary in how they look. Some tear or stretch before puberty, some after sex. It's not a reliable indicator of virginity
