"Speaking of unicorns, one time I had someone call me to say their computer has been working fine ever since I looked at it a few weeks back, and they just wanted to say thanks.

It hit me square in the head, wasnâ€™t prepared for that lol"
"Call from $HeadOfSales to me: ""We have a new employee starting today. Do you have a $TopOfTheLineLaptop and a telephone for him?"". This was ten-ish in the morning on a Monday."
Was the stab-happy user reprimanded or billed for this bout of knife-wielding insanity? 
"Reminds me of this glorious moment (the flairs were not originally present).

"IT people: I'm so use to stupid users that nothing shocks me anymore.

Users: Hold my beer, and watch this"
"It's good you didn't mess with her.

I have a few clients who demean themselves or otherwise get down on themselves for needing my help. I actually argue with them and tell them they shouldn't get down on themselves for not knowing. The fact that they're willing to learn is the real key.

I have one particular old lady who had a job a long time ago when computers first started hitting businesses. Her manager trained her and all the other employees that if they did anything contrary to EXACTLY the method he showed them they were terrible people and would ruin everything. To this day, even though we've gone over it and I've talked her through it she's traumatized and afraid everything she does will break everything...."
"The murderer is unfortunately still on the loose, but the money came out of his departments pocket."
For a second there i thought it was turning into a horrible death by printer somehow 
"The moment he touched me, that would have been the end of it.  Hang up the phone and walk out. Calmly call the boss and explain the situation on the way back to the office. Customers don't get to treat employees like shit. 

And I worry for that FI. That's a bad environment for her to be in. "
"&gt; Me: ""I am the manager.""

Followed by lightning crashes and ominous rolling thunder.  The four best words you are able to say to a customer when they ask that question."
Someone forgot to get their sandwich toasted at the store?
"I exist as an anomaly of limitless perfection poised gracefully on the razor sharp fence separating hate and love. Your unrest is the product of my holy balance.

"
"My parents are the opposite of this. Any link on the Internet is dangerous and will give their computer a mega virus that fries everything!

I emailed my mum a link to an online photo album from my vacation and she refused to click it until I showed her that I had indeed sent the message from my computer and that the link was safe. "
"That's honestly better than the alternative. 

My parents used to be very wary of online retail (keep in mind that my mom was a business analyst developing online/mobile banking software for large banks) but mellowed after a while.

Now they order stuff online like everybody else. "
"Sounds like my time at a $nonorofit...

I was the IT guy, but we still had two contractors for some reason.  One day a guy shows up with a server, and that's when I discovered we we're replacing the exchange server..."
"I've had this conversation many times:

&gt; me: ""You need to follow this process to get that done.""

&gt; them: ""When did this start, and who was informed of the new process?""

&gt; me: ""I don't know, I've only been with the company since 1998, I wasn't there for the rollout of this process.""
"
We need to know if this murderer is still on the loose!
"My boss has requested this as well.

&gt;Any time the line goes down I need to know about it

And yet his phone is always turned off or on silent when I call."
"Glad to see its not just in my corner of the world...

(I know its not, but, you know, its pretty damn lonely down here in the basement)"
"Huh, I always figured it was going to be a printer that summoned Cthulhu into our reality, but it appears laptop chargers are also an option.  Who knew? \^_^"
"Reminds me of this tale (quote taken from [this](https://news.slashdot.org/story/01/02/06/2030205/david-korn-tells-all) slashdot article)

Question 5) True Story?


*Was the story about you embarrassing a Microsoftie at a conference true? Specifically, that he was insisting that their implementation of ksh in their unix compatibility kit was true to the ""real"" thing and trying to argue the point with you. The argument ended when someone else finally stood up and informed the speaker who he was arguing with.*

*Just curious ...*

**Korn:** This story is true. It was at a USENIX Windows NT conference and Microsoft was presenting their future directions for NT. One of their speakers said that they would release a UNIX integration package for NT that would contain the Korn Shell.

I knew that Microsoft had licensed a number of tools from MKS so I came to the microphone to tell the speaker that this was not the ""real"" Korn Shell and that MKS was not even compatible with ksh88. I had no intention of embarrassing him and thought that he would explain the compromises that Microsoft had to make in choosing MKS Korn Shell. Instead, he insisted that I was wrong and that Microsoft had indeed chosen a ""real"" Korn Shell. After a couple of exchanges, I shut up and let him dig himself in deeper. Finally someone in the audience stood up and told him what almost everyone in the audience knew, that I had written the 'real' Korn Shell. I think that this is symbolic about the way the company works."
"I'm having trouble with the fact that someone who stabs printers to death with a kitchen knife is allowed anywhere near a printer that costs $10,000. "
He could easily get off on an insanity plea.  All he'd have to do is say the printer started it and no one in the room would doubt him.  
"Ticket marked ""~~User Terminated Successfully~~ Resolved"".
Reason:
&gt; I am the law."
That red ink refill
"I respect your for having lived through some of the same problems as I have,  
however, by making me relive them I've also grown to hate and despise you."
"Mmm. Welcome brother. Glad to have you in the coven. Here is your ceremonial baton...

See? Still too trusting. You just grabbed a cattle prod. We'll get that out of you soon enough."
"&gt; $HRManager: ""I guess I see what you mean.""

In some companies, $HRManager would have gotten fired... not for messing up, but for conduct unbecoming in admitting IT might have a point. Managers gotta have some self-respect!"
".....I can't help but feel that this is like a homeowner diagnosing an issue with their town's wastewater treatment system because their tapwater tastes like shit.

Sure, it's possible, but it really feels like the issue should have been caught a lot further up the line."
No malware from shitty programs also a big benefit imho
The question is: should you log the call as a support request or an incident?
The level of detail in this post is damn near award winning! 
"At least you got am ""I'm sorry."" and not a rant of insults.

""WELL, WHY WASN'T I TOLD IT WAS ON THE FRONT? IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SOMEWH-""

""Sir, it's on the user manual that came with the-""

""I WASN'T GIVEN A USER MANUAL! YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME THE MANUAL!"" "

Psychopathic behavior can be hard to spot before it's too late.
Maybe the line went down?
"When they ask to speak to my boss they just end up with two people who don't understand anything tech related and end up just forwarding them back to me, for me to tell them the same thing. "
"That's a shame, yeah my customer basically had that mentality. I suppose living in an age where stuff like this is common sense to us is not to them. I always had those evil thoughts after the fact, but naturally I never actually went through with them. I am to this day extra nice to everyone when working with tech support (which is basically what I'm doing now, even after my retail career). "
"Too bad he didn't hit a hot high voltage power supply.

"&gt; A pair of human legs are hanging out of an access panel in the side of the printer. 

There are some awful implications if you don't keep reading from here..."
"Lol. Wait til his coworkers learn the system will run just fine with two keyboards.  One for him, and a wireless one in another room for messing with him.  "
Dropped on an intake fan... fun times. 
"Yeah, you don't just grab employees like that suddenly. Why does it matter if he hears things or not? I don't care if he's a big shot, you don't interrupt a phone conversation unless it's an emergency. *EVER.*"
"TL;DR Non-profit hides massive, expensive project from their MSP for months only to find out it won't for their needs on the last day of implementation.  Could have been prevented had they read the vendor's paperwork.

"Man, he got shut. down."

Now you know why malware is so effective.
Should call him about that.

You filthy casual :D"
Secure from photography but not from sandwiches. Got it.
"We had someone who was doing that; he was telling his co-workers he was working from home, but telling his manager (who lived in another state) that he was working from the office. One day this conversation happened:

&gt; mgr: ""Where are you?""

&gt; emp: ""I'm at my desk.""

&gt; mgr: ""No, *I'M* at your desk.""
