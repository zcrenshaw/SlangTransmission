I don't have advice but I want you to know you're the parent that every little gay boy should have. 
"A lot of the depression and anxiety young gay men face comes from the fear that no one will accept them for being who they are, especially their family. The fact that you’ve told him that you support him is enough. Sure he’s gonna struggle with other people who don’t understand, but as long as he has that support as a rock to lean on everyday, he will be fine. Just make sure to let him know that he should never feel ashamed to tell you what is going on in his life and that you are there for him 100% of this journey called life. "
Jokes on you I am always awkward.
Don´t be a dick and invite him for a beer. And pay.
You are hereby classified as a Gentle Giant.
"If you are talking about your ass yes it will be larger immediately after sex, you did stretch it open after all. Don't worry it will tighten back to its normal size soon enough :D"
"It means you have the will power to take 100 lbs off your weight, in my opinion that's pretty impressive!!! Dude that is a great accomplishment. "
You're watching people whose income is dependent on social media and wonder why they're obsessed with social media? 
"You sound like a good bf, he’s in good arms now :)"
"You need to read The Epidemic of Gay Loneliness. It’s a comprehensive article that covers that many gay men struggle to find fulfilling companionship. Being cognizant of this would certainly make you a much more empathic person overall.

"Stay in, just leave the door open.

"
"It definitely does get better! High School is an extremely awkward time for most people.  For me, and a lot of people I know, my life really stared after high school.   After high school you can really find friends you feel comfortable with and start shaping your own life.   He’s already off to a great start because he has such a supportive father! I’d say just keep letting him know that you love him and are there for him.  Encourage him to be himself and everything will work out eventually!  Best of luck!"
"The last one. 

Kidding. Just do nothing. He's probably scared shitless right now. Let him have his peace. You know it can't go anywhere positive."
"I’m actually happy they went with that cause it represents how some gay people don’t act stereotypical one bit and that’s something a lot of people really should know.

But you know what? Some people would watch a movie about a gay character and understand the messages and explanatory of what it’s like - while if they made him stereotypical they might have been annoyed by that and not sat through the whole thing. It’s irrelevant, so it’s very good to just drop that for the purpose of the movie delivering the actual relevant messages to more people."
This is the cutest thing I have ever read in this god forsaken subreddit 
It was to a girl 
That's what all the teenage twinks think. Before you know it you're going to be tripping over it.
Sometimes I forget how much being a teenager sucked...
"I had an automatic negative reaction when I read his response wow. The Spanish part was too far, and if he wanted to bring race into it, then don't feel that bad you replied in the same way. "
"I wouldn't even messgae him.  There are no boundaries to set. You guys slept together. Now you have a student-professor relationship, so there should be zero contact that isn't strictly academic."
"I don’t know if you fully realize how much your brother really loves you and how much more he looks up to you now after all this. To you, this might not seem like a big deal, but to a semi-closeted 16-year old, this means the world. Thank you so much for being a good brother. It’s someone some of us wish we had in life. "
"I would be sad for him. If he would be likeable, I would make sure to hang out with him sometimes no matter if the date succeeds."
"I dont think its overly protective, you did what is right for your son as a wonderful mom. I think 14 is toooo young as well! So I dont think its wise to comeout publicly at his age, especially once he came out, he automatically make himself sort of available for the gay dating pool. If he's mentally strong enough to deal with the backlash, teasing or even bullying at school, then let him do it. You should tell him about that too, life isnt always pink, mom supports you but mom also knows best. 

But honestly you cant watch him 24/24. If he wants to try, he will. So i think its best to do what you are doing. But please also give him sex-ed talk for gay *cough* STDs*"
"As a quiet guy, I like quiet guys. It's nice to be with someone who knows how to stfu and be comfortable in silence. And people who don't talk much tend to have the most impactful things to say when they do talk. The thing is though that it can be hard to break the ice"

"Didn't know how to douche. Well, it happened."
The word is nigger. The fact that you're willing to type one out and no the other kind of answers that question; does it not? 
No unless they start talking about how they think a girl is hot.
Rape.
Welcome to the world of “Gay Preferences.” Where racism is masked as a “preference.” 
Correct: you can be a girl and curious about how it feels to fuck a gay
Shocker: the reverse is also true
"thank you.  He is going to do great things.  I just think he is loosing his way.  I love him more today then yesterday. 

"
"Maybe, but gays like him do exist. We also have Queer Eye, which is amazing too. It’s great to have a diverse view of the kinds of gay men. We don’t have to tear down masc, fem, or in-between men to life each other up. :-)"
"One professor's perspective here: if you message him now and try to talk about your prior hook-up, there is a decent chance he will think you're trying to entrap him and get screen shots to use against him.  Just pretend nothing ever happened. And do not, repeat DO NOT, tell anyone else in the class you hooked up with him. It will get back to him that you did. "
The freedom to be as masculine or feminine as I want at any given time without having to answer for it. 
"I’m straight and came across this from r/all, but what I can say (having read the other one too) is that sometimes, the box that you have those emotions in gets kicked. Mine was kicked, recently. After close to 20years, so it’s an old and musty box, but it was never dealt with or fully examined. 

I’m pleased your man has found the strength to sort this. Much easier now than in how ever many years down the line. "
"i watched too much porn. When i sucked my first,  i tried spitting on it but didnt even reach his dick ;( so embarrassing!!! "
We didn’t use lube. Hurt like hell.
"You did right. Be real. There might be a woman that gets him excited, but not any he sees. Certainly not her. He needs out of that relationship. He needs to start focusing on him and looking into dating people he actually appreciates, which are probably going to all be men."
Because movies are made for profit and if you put Armie Hammer's dick tearing apart Timmy Chalamet's asshole then your audience will go down by 98%

"it's just as offensive, but many people do not care about homophobia as much as they care about racism. "
Damn I wore one for 6 months and people at work still randomly ask me if I have a girlfriend. I just gave up and threw mine out.
"First impressions are unavoidable but there's a lot you can do to shape them. Be upfront about these feelings and people will respond to them. It's not like there's no demand for guys like you out there. 

It doesn't sound to me like you're a ""Twink"", which is a meaningless term that mostly describes a very narrow body, age and ethnic type; you just sound like a sweet, slightly submissive guy. "

"This might have already been said but, the whole point of the film is someone who’s been trying to hide his orientation and is scared of coming out.  I didn’t think that would be a very believable story of the character is extremely flamboyant/camp and you can tell he’s gay from a mile off.  

One of the messages of the film is that anybody can be gay and just because you’re gay doesn’t mean you have to conform to stereotypes (ie camp/effeminate).  So no, I don’t agree with that criticism."
Gays can be cruel bitches. Try staying away from the night spots and catty gay friends until your relationship finds a more solid footing.
"I'm gonna hang out with him again, he lives a mile from my house. He wasn't my type romantically or physically but he's a cool kid and I enjoyed hanging with him. I bought him breakfest this morning. "

Not ever worrying about an accidental pregnancy is up there.
It certainly won't get smaller pushing things up there ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
"I'm monogamous and have no desire not to be. That being said, if people want to sleep with multiple partners, that's their choice and none of my business. More power to them for living the way they want to. "
No risk of unwanted pregnancy!
"Maybe he's white and feels uncomfortable about it regardless of whether he's saying it out loud, but also gay so he has no problem saying faggot. That doesn't invalidate his question lol."
"He sounds like a really shitty person.

Keep blocking him... But keep a record in case you need to get a restraining order. "
"Top: hey, what are these strings hanging out of your asshole?

Bottom: it's to tighten up after this bussy gets beaten up."
"Well I am black and gay. The trials that you face as a gay man and a black man aren't really comparable. 

For me being gay is much harder on an internal level. As being black is obviously genetic, there is never really an internal struggle to 'not be black'.

However, I have found that being black is much harder on an external level. Struggling to find employment because of a 'black sounding name', being shot by the police for walking down the street whilst black, teachers giving you harsher punishments at school etc. 

At least when you are gay you have the option to hide from the external pressures when you are black you never have that choice. You should never have to make a choice but deciding not to come out on certain days so you don't have to deal with homophobic shit is a luxury that you aren't afforded whilst black. 

So yeah, in my experience they are both just different really. One last aside

&gt;Struggles that black (straight) people can't even imagine


The fact that many white gay men are *extremely* racist implies that they don't understand the struggle of being a racial minority as well as you might think. 
"
This. Do *something* for him to show your thanks...not talking sexual. Buy him a beer.
You can get a procedure that will add drawstrings on it that will help tighten it up after....
Not sure if it’s 100% a flaw but he hates it- he is a guy where the wind blows a way and he gets hard. I’ll not start getting hard until there’s hand to naked skin but before we’ve got to intense kissing he’s fully erect. He lounges around the house in cotton boxers a lot and he’s *constantly* hard. I think it’s adorable but he finds it really embarrassing. Says that he feels like a teenager still.
Alright I will let u use a towel if you come have sex with me! Deal? If it's good I'll even let you shower. 
Thought this was gonna be about love simon
Are you sure that you're a dude?
"that i didn't immediately leave when i actually met him in person

He used pictures that were clearly several years (if not a decade or so) older than what he looked like in real life, and he was *way* too aggressive (and too big!) even though i clearly told him it was my first time

Felt like shit immediately afterwards and didn't hookup for months after that"

Welcome to askgaybros where gaybros will go to great lengths to defend racial preferences and compare them to having height preferences or body type preferences 😂
He gives me upvotes and tells me how amazing I am.
"Porn is generally not my thing, but I stumbled upon this one a couple of years ago (one of those rabbit hole things where you start out looking up something innocuous and 20 minutes later you've landed somewhere totally unrelated) and, while it doesn't do anything for me sexually (and they don't even show that much), it's very intense and just really hot.

"I dated a guy for four years that would do this full-bodied chortle laugh if he found something to be ironically funny. 

I didn’t do it EVER when we dated. But when we broke up I found myself laughing the same way he does. 

I don’t mind at all, but there is some weird psychology going on there. We’ve talked a lot since the break up, and he says he does my high-pitches “eeeeee” sound when he thinks he might fall or something. "

"Hmm, I don't know actually, I'll check with my doctor."
There's a fine line for me - I really like guys that are quiet and reserved a majority of the time but they have a confidence that comes out in social settings. Definitely find that crazy attractive. 
I asked him not to use a condom... I was extremely horny and stupid. Nothing bad happened. But I still cringe and regret it. 
"When I teach him English and he says words with that cute Spanish accent or mispronounces words and we both laugh at it. Also when he starts talking about the things he loves and is passionate about and I just stare at him in amusement and give a deep sigh and say man, I love you! "
"LOL! As soon I read what he said I thought the exact same thing you said to him.

Also, where the fuck do you guys live that foreskin is ever an ""issue""?

I'm a fair skinned Cuban guy in Ft. Lauderdale and all the Anglo snowbirds and white guys that move here to escape the snow love the fuck out of my foreskin. Every single time I send someone a dick pic or show them my cock the first time out of their mouths is ""I love uncut!"". 

Being uncut has basically been an all you can fuck pass for me. "
"I’d wonder why.

It’s easy to assume the worst about someone, but it’s shown to be exceedingly hard to make lasting friendships after like 30.  Maybe he relocated.   Maybe something weird happened.  I, for instance, had an entire carful of female friends from college die in a car accident when I was 35.  A few more passengers and I’d have literally lost my whole clique.

I’d give him the benefit of the doubt."
"I worked in retail a few years back and the guy and his friend came into the store and then left, then the girl came back and walked up to the register and asked if I was gay and then single. 

That guy and me dated for a while . He was super sweet. "
It sounds like you might be in highschool or just have really boring straight friends.
U mean shit happened
"Wait why does this GSA also sound like the GSA at my college. There was only one other gay guy, everyone else was gender non conforming women who like another poster pointed out had blue hair and piercings. They was actually the president. Lol

No shade, me and the gay guy got a long really well and we're still friends today. But everyone else was obsessed with anime and horror movies and I couldn't relate. There was about 12 people."
"All my kids get the ‘you can’t wash it off with bleach’ talk... he knows, but maybe I should refresh him. Thank you! "
" this sub and r/gaybros absolutely lose their shit when they get called out for their ""preferences"" being thinly veiled racism. It's fucking hilarious"
"Well, this is really messed up.  I feel like you need to sit him down and have a talk with him about why this is wrong and how you will never feel the same way to him.

I guess it's a breach of his privacy, but your privacy has been violated way more.  Not to mention the trouble you could get into if someone else found these images.

My best advice is to talk to him, tell him this is wrong and very illegal, and make him delete any images he has of you.  If his behaviour isn't stopped now it could develop into something very dangerous.

You're a great person I give you that, my reaction to this would have been much more violent."
"That’s so adorable! 

I don’t have a husband (yet) but my boyfriend has the most amazing smile I’ve ever seen, he also is so cute with our puppy. We take turns holding him and singing songs to him and change the lyrics to something silly with his name in it lol "
"No, honestly be yourself. Chances are someone is attracted to you just the way you are. Someone might be in the same boat and you could potentially go to the gym together. "
That was an emotional rollercoaster.
I want a boyfriend like you. Continue loving your man the way you have and more blessings will come your way. Thumbs up.
If y'all out here trickin' on Grindr and you ain't got fuck-towels on deck you need to get it together and step your pussy the fuck UP.
I dropped it on my Facebook and don't care to explain it to every single individual.  If they ask I'll answer but I'm so not gonna come out to every single individual.
"Indeed, having a supportive parent makes a huge difference in a gay kid’s life. "

"You‘re an awesome, loving brother and I think you handled the situation just fine.
I think he will eventually embrace his sexual orientation  and stop thinking it is wrong to be gay, and find someone with whom he can develop a healthy romantic relationship.
Just make sure he keeps going to the therapist and he‘ll be just fine :)
Kudos to you for being so understanding and loving to hin"
They're probably waiting for you to say you're not into girls 
the possibility of fucking and being fucked at the same time
r/LGBTeens might be a better subreddit for him actually. Great and supportive community which personally helped me out alot when I was a young teenager. 
"I thought this was going to be about wanting guys to shit on your face. 

Your speedo/swimmer fetish is barely even kinky. "
"On one hand I get what you mean, but at the same time it sounds like they never had a brotherly relationship and they also didn't see each other during the years you actually start to become a person (7-teens). So to this kid he was probably less of a brother and more of a hot guy that stayed at his house sometimes. "
Another professor here: all of this. And is there another section of the same course you could take? That is the first step to clear ethical issues where I teach. 
They never forget. 
"This x10. I've always jerked off to it before, but then when it happened it was so fucking awful."
You go Glen Coco! 🙌🏻
"Incest obsessions onto older gay siblings are not uncommon. 

Now that you know,  and he knows you know by the way, he may be hoping against hope that this may be an opportunity for him to have sex with someone he trusts. 

Not talking about it is just exacerbating it. 


Get him to go with you to a park to throw frisbee, spend some time with him and then casually bring it up: “I have to tell you that I think you are crossing some lines.” “Letting your desires for other people turn into taking naked pictures of them without consent can get you in big trouble. I want you to promise not to ever do it again.”

“I want you to know that I respect and love you, so am hoping you develop some boyfriends or girlfriends, and I get that you might have messed up a lil bit, so needed to help you understand how to go about things.” 

Basically, he needs to know it doesn’t matter, that all is well, and that he needs to be appropriate with s other folks.
"
Sounds like someone needs green card.
He’s gay.
"I dated a guy years ago whose 'trick' in picking up guys in the normal course of his day was ... wearing a wedding ring.  He swore that when he put that on, he got so much more action.

That probably speaks to the dynamic going on with regard to men on Grindr who claim to be 'straight'."
Literally all of my straight female friends. 
"I know what you're talking about - the GSA they started in my high school, and the LGBT clubs at both of the colleges I went to were very small and full of these types - mostly alternatively dressed women and such.  If you stick around, you'll see it turn into a group where everyone dates everyone else, and by the end of the year no one is in the group anymore.  

I think gay guys sometimes have to find community and similar perspectives elsewhere."
My problem is that after I cum I lose interest in sex so a guy trying to make out with me with my cum is gross in the moment.
"One of us! One of us! We accept you, one of us!"
"cocks, hairy armpits and hairy legs and how hot guys are, thank fuck I'm gay I could never like pussy, ah the life"
"Yeah, a simple not interested would have been enough. "

"Once you’ve come out, and you’ve been out for a while, you tend develop a don’t give a shit attitude and a thick skin. It’s a pretty good trait to have."
"&gt;Based on data from their cell phones, neither Mateen or Salman had ever been in the vicinity of Pulse before. On the night of the attack, Mateen first went to Disney Springs and EVE Orlando ― both of which had heavy, visible security ― before ending up at Pulse after a Google search for “downtown Orlando nightclubs.” Notably, his search did not include the words “gay” or “LGBT.” 

Interesting - so it does seem to have been randomly chosen. At the time of the attack, I lashed out at Salman and thought she should go to jail for a long time - she had confessed to knowing he was going to Pulse and helping him scope it out. This apparently was a false confession. It’s good to at least know the truth now."
"How he's always down for cuddles, and reminds me to calm the fuck down when I'm being hysterical about dumb shit. He's so cool, calm, and level headed..."
Looking good 😁 You should remain friends and hang out
"I wouldn't care if a guy wanted to shower, but honestly, I prefer using tissues over towels myself so it's what I'd offer to someone else.

using a towel seems kinda grody, tbh. like, what, it's going to sit in the laundry basket all week with dried cum on it? at least with a tissue you can just flush it down the toilet."
"I do think its a legitimate problem. When people say ""that's so gay"" implicit within that is that ""gay"" means something bad. 

If a young kid hears ""that's so gay"" and asks what ""gay"" means, what do you say?

Maybe for people who are old enough to understand nuance it isn't a problem. But when you're teaching kids that ""gay means bad"" it can really fuck with them when they start asking themselves ""am I gay?""
"
"Once you're out, you're out. After that it's just providing clarification. It doesn't ever have to be a proclamation or extravagant gesture: just casually say something about dudes. "
"I dated this cute Korean with a strong accent almost a couple decades ago. To this day, I sometimes worry that I'll ask the barista for a copy please."
The absence of women makes gay porn better than straight porn.
"I do most of the laundry. I kind of just ""know"" what is mine and what is his. Though we share shirts, socks (we threw out most of our old ones and just bought a ton of the same general kind for basic use), and even sometimes underwear anyway. We have different waist sizes so we can't share shorts/pants. Even despite the sharing, I put his shit on his side of the dresser/closet and mine on mine. No idea ""how"" I know, I just kind of do?  "
"“I’m just so scared of commitment to one person. I turn into a monster. But if you want to fuck me and be my emotional partner while I fuck others that’d be great.”

And so I ended the relationship. "
oh honey
"your points about reducing gay relationships to sex and attraction are important. however, then you said this:

&gt; god i wish the stereotype that gay men are just horny pigs would just be dispelled already but you guys make it so hard


it's not our fucking job fight stereotypes of our community. it's everyone else's job to stop looking for confirmation of stereotypes; stereotypes should be disregarded entirely. You know what? some of us ARE horny pigs, and that's not only just ok, that's fucking AWESOME. we have earned that right to express ourselves in that way. and if people look at horny pigs and reduce the entire gay community to that, that's just homophobia reinforcing stereotypes. 


yes, if we all wanted monogamy and were less open about sexual attraction, straight people would like us more. that is undeniably true. but you know what? that's not our problem, as individuals and as a community. fuck everything about that, i'm not changing my behavior nor anyone else's behavior so that we ""look better"" to straight people. i suggest you interrogate your motivations for writing this post in this context."
Can you hint at which republican seat in congress he's currently in?
I want him to explain to me why multiplying two negative numbers ends up with a positive one
"Some in the men’s locker room in high school when they were taking showers.

Some in my friends pool when we all decided to swim naked.

And some gay friends when they’ve sent me nudes."
"It's not that we support mass immigration. We just see it as something inevitable and think that the best thing to do would be to treat people who come to our country with decency and compassion instead of the violence and rejection right wingers propose. 

Why? Because it's the right thing to do. Treating people as humans. Not judging them and thinking they're all the same. Because that's what homophobes do with us. And it doesn't feel good.  

Besides, in most countries, politicians and groups who reject Muslims or immigrants in general are usually the ones who fight against gay rights so...

Edit: Even in my country, Mexico, we have a similar thing with people from countries like Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, where they literally kill gays (picture a similar situation to Chechnya) coming in by the thousands. I say: let's keep them. They're fleeing for their lives and it's not as if they're all from gangs."
He's just bisexual 
"I've noticed on here nobody seems to fantasise about finding out their apparently straight friend, that they sit next to in Science class and pine over, is actually bi! Despite it being a much more plausible sexual scenario. Sucking bi cock or getting fucked by one, even if you were his first guy, clearly isn't anywhere near as hot a fantasy as a pure str8 one :)"
"Just tell him that you'll be there for him, no matter what happens. That you'll listen when he decides to tell you anything. That you can keep secrets, if he wishes. Bring up the topic again, when the situation is right - maybe ask if he knows any other gay kids, but don't be overly inquisitive. Give him the condom talk once and only once. If he doesn't have a crush yet, just offer to invite him over, when and if he finds someone.

As for grandkids: You said it jokingly that you still want some. Perhaps you should make it clear that it was meant as a joke and you didn't intend to pressure him into anything.

On the topic of dating: Please be aware that dating does not equal sex. 14 is okay for a kid to start exploring relationships. If you feel uncomfortable with him being too young, you should tell him that you are concerned, he should be careful, but it is ultimately his life and his decision.

Oh, and please don't go to jail over some asshole being mean to your kid. Religious communities can be tough, maybe you should go out there and talk to them if your son is out and they want to trouble him. Most people can be persuaded with reason to leave him be."
"My advice is to encourage him to do guy stuff,  even if it's with you. To develop interests that will allow him to connect with other males. So many young gay boys grow up completely disconnected from healthy masculinity and are then unable to relate to straight men or navigate male spaces/groups and then grow up into adults that can only function in the gay ghetto and all their friends are women. 

If he's just not interested that's OK too but in my experience young gay boys are starving for friendship and validation from other guys. They're just too afraid, sometimes justifiably, that they will be rejected or struggle to fit in. 

I'm very grateful for my dad for taking me to sports games, hunting/fishing, involving me in his hobbies etc. I was a shy, effeminate little boy and I think it was obvious even then that I wasn't ""normal"" but he always made it clear that he was just happy to include me in his hobbies and wasn't out to try and make me ""straight"". 

I understand this might be difficult with so many kids. I was the only son. I'm sure you'll get plenty of good, and not so good, advice here but that's mine. "
"Absolutely. Both words are used to insult two historically oppressed and still discriminated minorities. Except one of those minorities still faces death, jail or other forms of punishment in 70+ countries, and still faces other struggles in places where that's not the case. Struggles that black (straight) people can't even imagine, like getting kicked out of home, despised by your own parents because of a harmless biological trait you never chose, being taught since young age that you are sick, that even the creator of the world - who loves everyone and everything - finds you disgusting, that you need to change the unchangeable or suffer for all eternity. If anything, I think people should be more careful with the f-word."
"This may be an unpopular opinion, but rather than teaching him just resiliency or to be tough in the face of bullying and small mindedness, I would suggest focusing on empathy. 

Understanding why these people are the way they are and trying to see things from their point of view is essential to growing up without bitterness. 

It’s not that homophobic people deserve empathy, it’s that he deserves to grow up being everything that they aren’t, especially when it comes to empathy. 

Your son was born gay, his classmates were made homophobic, as were the people who made them that way. 

It may seem counterintuitive, but your son is the one who has to do the understanding because he is the one operating in his natural state in this scenario, There is nothing about your son that needs to be figured out or understood, he is himself. The ones who need someone to help them work through what is making them act in such an unnatural way are those who would bully him for being himself. "

Talking to this guy on Grindr and we both love RPGs and games in general. I am significantly more interested than most others before him. 
Not sure this has anything to do with getting older. I've been watching porn for 20 years now and I've never thought about any of this stuff.

"I was raised way out on a Native American Reservation.  A very butch cowboy culture.  In a huge clan with a military tradition.  I was doing cowboy tricks on the horse before I could read or write.  Raised from early childhood in martial arts.  Three year Letterman, etc.  

When I came of age I joined the military like all my kin.  That is when I figured out that I liked the boys and not the girls.  My problem was the fact that gays gave me grief pretty much every where I went.  I was perfectly fine with the straight guys, and my military comrades.  It was the gay community that was hard to break into."

" I lived in Korea for 4 years where it was very common to sleep at a Sauna-Hotel after a night of drinking (about ten bucks a night). Being a sauna where dudes walk around naked, I saw all of my male friends naked at one point. 

After four years of that I really don’t consider being naked that weird anymore. I kind of chuckle now at the gym at how hard guys work to never be nude for any reason. "
"EXCUSE ME do I look like I'm fucking made of towels!? Is there a towel tree growing outside? NO! If I hook up with a guy a couple times a week that's at least A HUNDRED towels a year extra I need to wash!

You'll get tissue paper and like it! There's not even a tangible benefit to using a towel! Fresh towels are for houseguests not Grindr hookups. I bet you go down on your prostitutes and cuddle them afterwards, Jesus."

"It's great she's so supportive but you're also right in demanding you come out at your own pace. It sounds like she loves you and cares for you and since you're living abroad, her outing you should be a bit less concerning to you.

sadly a lot of guys will just get you to send pics and tell them what you’re into so they can rub one out at home. Happened to me a few times and it always sucks.  Ive never had an experience 100% like yours and as your first hookup experience it’s really no good.  It’s just the nature of the beast that is Grindr.

Aren't you???"

"Am blond and I think I have a bright pink asshole, if my (face) cheeks are an indicator. I have never heard of that being a especially wanted combination before, that is cool :D

And to answer your question my boyfriend has this thing he would do when he was frustrated or losing his patience, he would tilt his head and his mouth would go flat, in a special way. And I find myself doing it now, it's a little wierd. I have heard its normal for people who are attracted to each other to copy body language though so that is probably why"
"This is usually my favorite part, tbh."
I made the mistake of reaching 19 and having the mentality of 'just wanting to loose it' I messaged the most open sexualy active guy I knew and straight up told him I want t my v card stamped. Bleh... Looking back I wish I had waited. 
"Girls, I had no problems with. When I was 18, me and this other dude we’re gonna fuck each other and because it was our first time doing it with a guy, we didn’t realize that lube was needed, and the first half hour was filled with “WHY WONT IT GO IN LIKE IN PORN”. In retrospect, it was hilarious. "
i'm not sure a rainbow wristband is as subtle as you think it is.
"There's a difference between ""sorry I prefer uncircumcised"" and ""sorry I don't play around with uncut spanish penises."" He was clearly a jerk and shaming you. 

But also what you said back was hella racist. Fortunately it's sort of a free pass because this guy's feelings don't matter and you shouldn't worry about him. But yeah definitely check yourself-- that should not be your first response when insulted. Otherwise you're kind of just as bad as him.

So you know, no harm done. Don't feel bad, just take note. Live and learn, be less racist next time."
"Damn, buddy. I'm sorry to hear that."
"I had a good gay college friend who would deliberately -to be funny- mispronounced certain words, (he was a linguist) for instance: ""daffodils"" would be ""da-foo-duls"". Our group of gay friends got so used to doing it, that years later most of us are still catching ourselves saying those silly words, to the puzzled looks of strangers. Maybe, they think we have little kids at home and we don't know how to speak ""adult"" anymore! 😁"
"&gt; I'm 26, a virgin, never kissed never did anything intimate with anyone

Good, it will always be more easy to start all that in your twenties.

&gt; closeted

You don't have to wait to be out to start dating

&gt; fat

The first thing you must work on : you will be more attractive, and above all it will give you your confidence back. And that's something you can work on even while depressed, so make it your priority.

&gt; 0 social skills, no friends

That's the second thing you can work on, because it's less scary than dating. And to meet people, you can try to...

&gt; lazy, unmotivated

... find a hobby / a job / a club / an association. Something constructive to work on, and with people.

&gt; depressed

Therapist. No kidding, don't waste time trying to come out of depression on your own.

&gt; poor

That's just not important for friends and/or dating.

Seriously, 26 yo is still young enough to have all the cards in your hand. Don't wait another 10 years to try to solve the problem, it will be much more difficult then."
"He is getting a lot from you just being there and listening to him. 

It is amazing that he was able to talk to you. Probably the first time he ever felt safe enough to say aloud that he is gay. 

The lazy girlfriend will eventually fall by the wayside, he has some work to do in cleaning up his life, don’t “fix” it for him, let him do it himself, and he will be stronger for it. "
I advertise on Grindr that I will draw their dick :)
"You can tell him: ""Hey, man, I know it's awkward, but we did some stupid things on my birthday. I want you to know that that kiss mean nothing to me, we were just drunk hahaha I miss your company. Let's hang out or something"". "
"Damn, you handled it too well."
If your boyfriend said you’re not like the rest of them I’d be more concerned about that.

He's not a size queen for not wanting to bottom a micro-penis. It's a medical condition and it's practically impossible o enjoy bottoming with it...
I confronted a colleague at work about his use of the word “faggot.” He clearly doesn’t know I’m gay and he’s not as enlightened as I once gave him credit for. I asked him not to ever use that term in my company.
"If you’re tall, hairy and muscular you are not a twink. End of story. Lol

Those “labels” are purely to describe body type really. You don’t need to be a certain way since you’re bigger, just be yourself! I guarantee you there are people out there who would be into your body and personality."

"It's pretty weird for straight people to wait nowadays never mind anybody else. Sexual incompatibility is normally fatal for any relationship in the long run, so most wouldn't want to risk that and of course sex is often pleasurable, not many want to artificially deny themselves that pleasure. If it was really important to you though, it doesn't matter if it's weird to others."
"The movie even touches on this, when Simon talks to Ethan and realizes that being out early is a double edged sword. Ethan came out younger and seems more confident with himself, but he also got bullied and ostracized in a way Simon didn't. I like that they made it clear that we all have different paths, and each one has its own unique struggles and benefits."
I was too young
Lol you say this as if its an unpopular opinion.. pretty sure everyone would agree with it being their choice. The post was about people flaunting negative stereotypes about the community. Not questioning the right for them to make those choices.
"Nah, I wouldn't really call jacking off to pics of your brother normal teenage problems..."
In the past I came to the conclusion I will probably be without a romantic partner but that didn't mean I was going to be alone. I still had very meaningful nonromantic relationships like my friends and family. While that changed 4 years ago ( got together with my current bf) I still think that living without a partner would not be that scary. You can live a happy and fulfilling life single.
"I always offer a shower and always offer a clean towel. I completely agree. 
What's wrong with some of these guys!?!"
Well let me tell you most straight guys don't only talk about girls. They talk about them more in highschool but after that its a rare thing to come up in conversation (baring they are dating/married to one)

"simply put: i'm a horny 20-something, and read countless other hookup horror stories and realized that this isn't that uncommon

My second hookup was 6 months after that. I was very upfront with the guy that I had a terrible past experience, and i wanted to take it slow. He was very understanding, and since he knew how to give massages, he suggested that to get comfortable, we start off with a massage. And it was great. He was friendly, gentle, and funny, so all of that helped a great deal.

Apparently it's very common for the first time to be bad. And even the 2nd and 3rd and 4th. But you make mistakes and you learn. And ever since then I've been an insatiable horndog and gotten ""good"" at sex"

That twist got me more than M. Night Shyamalan! I was envisioning some tearful girl trembling as she looks at his workout music library: “The entire...discography of...Britney Spears?! Nooooo!”
U get a towel in any case! But shower is only if it was decent sex. If it was horrible it'd feel awkward for u to stay long enough to shower. 
Awwwwwwww &lt;3

"It bothers me that LGBT people turn away allies of any kind. I don’t think the type of police officers that would target minorities are the same type that are open minded enough to go to a pride parade. I firmly believe in bridging divides and excluding police is far from that.

 Now I don’t know how much BLM has to do with this as I’ve lost interest in the news recently. However last year I believe they got the police eject from Vancouver pride. And while I still don’t think police should be banned, I don’t mind queer black people voicing their concerns over police being at parades. However it rubs me *extremely* wrong when straight black people say they feel uncomfortable about gay police being at the parade. No straight person should be able to tell any gay person they can’t attend a pride parade."
I would love to rest in penises....
"You should look up the Sacred Band of Thebes also. It's basically a military squadron composed of male lovers (couples). The theory was that they'd fight better if their lives or their lover's lives were on the line, and were less likely to desert as well. "

"1. Gay guys are masters of blowjobs. When a woman gives you a head, you have to give her commands and directions, other way she won't know what to do. Sure, you can train her to do good but it will never top the natural tenderness and knowledge about dick's weak spots that makes stimulation so much easier for gay men. With them, you can just relax, lie down, get your hands under back of your head and enjoy without worrying about having your orgasm ruined or getting hurt by teeth. Gay men have been on the other side of a blowjob, they know what to do, when to slow down, when to focus on the head, so naturally, they will be superior in that matter.

2. You have twice as much things that make you click. You can easily be not only lovers but also best friends. I've been with my girlfriends on football matches before. All I heard whole two hours was ""when will it end?"". When I went for a match with my boyfriend, we both knew what we were doing there and we wanted to be there. That's why all my best memories are from back then, when I was still with my first and only boyfriend.

3. You can borrow your clothes, cosmetics, shaving machines and, obviously, sex toys. Seems irrelevant but you have no idea how many times he saved my ass with a clean shirt or when I ran out of deodorant.

4. You can make a dick-dick rub, cum in one hand and make swords fights."

"Being enthusiastic and emotional and open. He once asked me how I manage to keep my cool and remain muted and mellow at all times, the answer’s not always pretty. He traverses the world like he’s never been scarred or hurt, like a child. I love him for that so much because he gives me moments where I feel like that: airy, amenable, alive. 

(Conversely, he’s told me that my default monotone voice and shyness made him want to “glomp” me the minute we met)."
"I've had a few people make subtle comments when I've been out with my bf, nothing to the degree that you mentioned though. Think it bothered him at first, but he just kind of goes along with it now. Have had some not so nice things said here on reddit when i posted pic of us, granted neither of the pics I posted have been very flattering pics of him. Regardless I make sure he doesn't see this account.

I'm pretty much in the same position as you're bf just the opposite, bodybuilder here and I think people perceive me as hyper-masculine (even though I don't think I am). the ironic thing is my bf definitely wasn't that into my body when we first started dating."
