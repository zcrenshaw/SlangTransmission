Sounds like your car had some serious body damage.
"Dude, sit on the toilet! It makes a great echo and helps with any unwanted poo-jectiles"
"When you get chewed out by your manager, break out into an even louder fit of nervous laughter. You have to commit 100% now."
"Today I made the play I was in 100% more entertaining 

Or

Today I gave the crowd their money's worth."
**TIL** you can't microwave the newer Pyrex measuring cups. Go figure. Hopefully your wife's eyes healed up!
"This is the point where a parent just goes and locks themselves in the bathroom for awhile, or mows the lawn, or just steps outside for five minutes to recover. The mess will still be there and so will your family. It's better than any other alternative choices at that point."
"They should have fired the person who approved painting a wall that'd cost $5,000 to fix if it got a fingerprint-sized blemish on it. 

Then again, that was probably the owner. "
"&gt; I asked them how this would affect me at the temp agency, and they told me not to worry about it. However, I haven‚Äôt heard a word for them for two weeks now, so I‚Äôm starting to really worry.

You're fired bro, find another temp agency. "
take your fucking upvote and get the fuck out. 
"This is one of those posts I click on and read, even though I really, really, REALLY don't want to.

And now, among many other complexes, I can now worry about centipedes invading my asshole the moment I'm not paying attention while on the shitter."
"MD here. That is absolute horseshit.

1. Men who contract HIV via non-IVdrug routes (ie sex) do not have a lower life expectancy than people without HIV. Again, contracting HIV, if you are treated, will not affect your life expectancy. You will not die earlier.

2. Yes it sucks right now, yes you have to deal with a whole new, complicated world, with medical appointments, strange pills and a new vocabulary. But this is temporary. After a couple of years, if you take the meds, it can literally be a MD check up every six months that last five minutes. Actually.

3. The stereotype of '' a lot of meds each day'' comes from the early days of therapy, when people had to take huge amounts of pillls at varying times. Now, it can be on pill a day. So every morning, you take one pill and thats it (this may depend on financial ressources, where I work its government funded and free, but I don't kow for South Africa).

4. There used to be serious side effects, but with the integrase inhibitors discovered in 2007, the therapy  is actually beyond begin.

5. You can 100% have kids, dont ever let anyone tell you otherwise. Obviously tell future partners about your situation, but if you are controlled (ie no active virus (usually achieved within 6 months)), then you partner takes prophylaxis (a softer version of the full treatment) , then you can 100% have a kid. She will not have HIV. You will be a father.

6. All of the above is conditional on getting treatment. Sure it sucks, but a pill a day and a couple of blood draws ever months is nothing. This used to be a death sentence, and it is without treatment, with treatment its kinda a meh..... The social stigma is the worse part.

7. The social stigma is the worse part. Remember that this in no ways reflect on you as a person. It is not who you are.

At a party a while back, someone asked a bunch of us if we would rather have HIV at 25-30 or diabetes. Every single doctor there said HIV. If you take control of this, it wont define your life."
I would think the remains on your car would need to be treated and cleaned as a biohazard.
You won the theater.
"I don‚Äôt want to be suspended on a matter of uncontrollable laughter, I‚Äôll sound like a psychopath haha!"
You need to start using the bathroom across the street at the gas station. 
I think every decision you've made in this story was the wrong one 
"Eeesh I was worried the boiling water was going to meet the table sex somehow, ended much better."
"Kind of similar to me. I was pulled over as a teenager back in the 90's and the cop said he pulled me over bc a taillight was out. I was like 'oh really?' and opened the door so I could go take a look. He ended up smashing the door against my leg and was like 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!' I was like, I wanted to check the light out. He was like 'oh', and then let me go look lol."
"My story of almost getting shot.

I was playing airsoft with some friends earlier. Sit outside near the street chatting it up with my friends cus it's dark and we can't play more but still want to hang out. 

Cops roll up cus it's a small town and there are some young adults standing on the side of the road. One notices s gun in my pocket. Remember we were playing airsoft and I still had the pistol in my pocket.

Cop looks at me ""is that a gun"" and I get all excited ""ya, let me show you"" as I start digging it out of my pocket. Before I know it 6 cops have guns up yelling at me. I drop it and a cop runs up and kicks it away as they restrain my dumb ass.

Scariest moment of my life. "
Well that was an unsettling read.
Probably just stick to being a wide receiver.
I did a similar thing in HS with my lapel Mic backstage. The guy working the board didn't mute me so the entire play &amp; audience heard half my burger king order before they realized I was hot mic'd.
But.... Did you finish? 
"&gt; I‚Äôll sound like a psychopath haha!

There it is again, that nervous laughter is really out of control.

"Yup, looks like the brand was sold in the late 90's and they switched to soda-lime glass instead of borosilicate.   "
"&gt;I was maybe 20? It was like 7 years ago

""Yeah let me show you!""

Please tell me in the last 7 years you've gotten a bit more common sense 

"
Why do you fart naked on the floor in the first place
"I read somewhere that in a lot of countries, people who've had a murder or really messy death occur in their house, are often left to their own devices after the emergency services are done.

Imagine that - having to clean up gore and shit by yourself, and then living there."
How do you make shit that's NOT microwavable nowadays?!
"Ooh how i have waited for this moment...



See, Microwaves don't actually use heat.
They use microwaves. The microwaves end up moving any water molecules inside whatever is being microwaved at intense speeds, so fast that the friction causes them to heat up.

The formula in Pyrex cups doesn't break with heat, rather by the glass being a somewhat softer material with a molecular density likely similar to ice.


So, it isn't heat that broke her cup, it was vibes."
"You may have ruined a gold wall, but you can still look for the silver lining!"
"""There ain't deer in mesquite"" is perfect script dialogue "
Ya exactly. If you where on the toilet then this would have been avoided.

"GRAPHIC WARNING 

This is actually what happens in Louisiana (from my experience at least). A family friend shot himself in the head, in the home on his bed. There was blood everywhere, soaked into the matress, spewed on the floor, and face/skull/brain bits splattered everywhere.

His family was left to clean it up literally with whatever they could find at the store."
"*""I'll have 2 number 9s...""*"
"Haha, with all those worms in there, bet there wasnt.. *mushroom* in there..."
"I find it really hard to believe that a normal person *wouldn't* do this, so i'm calling bullshit. "
Now I'm scared because I have one and have microwaved it and it hasn't shattered...  *but what if it does?!*
"I'm imagining the scene: /u/alglas  and wife standing by the side of the road, perhaps arm-in-arm. Shaken but safe, ""I think we hit a deer!""

Dude climbs down from his F250 Super-Duty. Looks at OP and his wife. Turns to look at the carnage. Turns back to OP and his wife and gives them *that* look. You know the one I mean; it's the one where you can't decide whether what you heard is wishful thinking or just plain denial. 

He takes the toothpick out of the side of his mouth and stares into the distance. 

""Son, there ain't nary a deer within three-hunnit mile of here. And shoot, even if there was, they don't make Reeboks that fit a hoof."""
Wait...you didn't realize a turd came out until you saw it on the floor? How loose is your asshole?
I think the age is necessary for better appreciation of this story

I was so confused at first because I didn't realize what you meant by dropping off your kids at the pool 
Sex. The answer is sex.
Sorry to break it to you Canada :( just a shitty basement apartment
I still can't imagine what goes through the mind of someone who considers climbing on a table that has a hot plate with boiling water on it
"Same thing happened to me, except the cop wouldn't even let me out of the car to see which tail light was out while I sat there for 45 minutes in pain because he'd literally put his full body weight into slamming the door on my leg. Hurt for days."
"My wife introduced me (father) to the ""mommy break:"" give the kids something to do that you know will hold their concentration for at least five minutes, then sneak off into the other room with a pint of ice cream. Might only get 2-3 bites in, but it helps"
"Completely agree, but... isn't it kinda sad that we have to be coached on how to interact with ""public servants"" without being shot? I remember being told in school that police were your friend, now it's tips for how to not get your head blown off. üòû"
Considering Pyrex is specifically a heat resistant brand (it's even in the Latin root of the name) labeling something Pyrex that shatters when heated is really almost criminal. 
I was maybe 20? It was like 7 years ago
Scarier than 99% of the shit you see on r/nosleep
Same thing happened to me with a state trooper. I leaned out with my hands up as he had his hand on his holster. Told me I almost gave him a heart attack. Glad he was cool about it and we shared a laugh while both our heart rates dropped to normal.

"At least you caught it early (I'm assuming). If you take your meds and listen to Dr.'s orders you can live a full and long life. Remember this feeling, and don't spread this to anyone else. It sucks, but its not the end of your life. Best of luck. "
"Nope, PYREX was bought out by a company that makes shitty knockoffs of respectable products and cashes in on the name (much like EA).  You can tell because they changed the name to a lower-case ""pyrex."""

"My wife thought she could knock me of a raft in a similar fashion.   I'm 15 inches taller and 135 pounds heavier.  I saw her coming out of the corner of my eye, reached back, caught her life jacket with one hand and tossed her like a toy into the freezing cold river."
Go with it. You're a fucking legend at school now.
"I was expecting food poisoning or at least the shits. Also, do you have flies? That's a lot of maggots to get out of the blue"
I love the dedication to the punishment. Everyone suffers at the hands of your mistake. So brutal but ultimately harmless. Thanks for sharing.
Holy shit. How are you doing mentally/emotionally?
It could be exploding right now! Have you checked? *Should* you check?!
"Once, I got pissed off that my daughter had just poured new kitty litter on top of the old kitty litter instead of cleaning out the old and replacing it with new. I got so mad that I flipped over the 3 litter boxes, and had to clean up a huge pile of shitty litter. Then I had to drag the trash bag of litter up the basement stairs, which are wooden and have spaces in between. So I get this extremely heavy trash bag to the very top step and it rips, sending all the kitty litter back down into the basement for me to clean up once again."
"I guess you're lucky you pull your pants down to let loose a bung blast, or you would've shit your pants.

"Ah for fuck's sake.  So sorry about that.

A friend of mine killed himself after a long mental illness. He shot himself in the heart, in a remote part of a forest near Santa Barbara, CA, leaving a note where could be found.  "

He was pretty far up the road. He went about a mile up the road before pulling over. I never actually saw him. 
Where was the semi in all of this? Did they flee? Cops say they talked to him but he is nowhere in your story. Wouldn't he have been right there after calling it in?

"My wife did something similar to me, but by ""accident"". I have to put an ointment in my eye every night before I go to sleep. I keep it by the bathroom sink. I'm usually fairly sleepy when I have to get up and go to the bathroom to put the ointment in. Well one day she sweetly cleaned up the bath room. Placing my ointment away, and in it's place left a very similar looking thing of earwax removal.

She was nice enough to read to me for the next 3 days while I was temporarily blind."
"Yeah, temp agencies are shit.  They offer ""opportunities"" to candidates they like, and they probably don't like you very much."
Had a cop pull a gun on me once. Only time I've ever been in handcuffs. Don't smoke weed next to an abandoned barn and then try to drive away from the cop kids. I've since grown and smoke weed like an adult. Late at night in my bedroom.

"A teacher at my high school did it like that too, went out into the woods alone and shot himself.  He was so gregarious and happy appearing on the surface so it was a huge shock to the school but I guess he was mentally ill and just covering it up."
"I had 14 guns trained on me at once. The police were looking for a dude staying at my neighbor's. This guy was living in a van with hippy stuff painted all over the sides ""save the water"", ""love trees"", stuff like that. I lived out in a cabin and was a sever alcoholic at the time.

So I'm upstairs, drunk, and hear car doors slamming. I look out the window and there are 7 squad cars. So I think, whatever, guess I'll go talk to them. So I stroll downstairs, wave out the door's window and open it without a care in the world. Suddenly I find myself staring down the barrels of all their guns. They command me to show hands, and I do, smiling and saying whoa.

They relax a bit and start questioning me about the guy they're looking for. The hippy dude and his friend were doing the dirty in the back of the van out in front of a neighbor's house, so they called the cops on him. The police showed and he reportedly took off, naked, through the woods towards mine and my neighbor's house. There were pounds of mushrooms in the van.

I let the police search my house and they couldn't find him. I even gave them ideas where to look since there are a lot of nooks and crannies. Then they left after asking me more questions. They warned me that they recorded the conversation, but I didn't care.

Turns out the dude *was* in my house and hiding under a bed. He was my sister's friend and she told me this.

Anyway, I had a grand mal seizure when I told my sister this story. The end."

"Hahaha, you got lied to.  They don‚Äôt make microphones that just automatically turn on when you pass a certain area or boundary.

There are boundary mics that are put on stage that catch the stage noise and whatnot of cast members without mics, but they suck and only really pick up foot traffic, unless you know how to strategically place them.

As an aside, according to a driver I spoke to once, when they see someone on the tracks, they're instructed to toot the horn, slam on the brakes, and either leave the driver's cabin or if they can't, turn around, close their eyes and cover their ears because there's nothing you can do at that point."

"When I was 17 I was driving home late at night. I had just finished smoking weed with a friend in my truck and still had a bag in the back seat. I notice a cop is following me out of town. Stoned me is getting very paranoid. 

Then I notice my head lights getting dim and the engine starting sounding funny. I am going downhill  half mile away from my driveway when the engine dies. I  throw it in neutral and am able to coast until I am 100 yards away from my driveway. He lights me up as I slow to a stop. 

I couldn't roll down my windows because my battery had died. So I quickly jump out and lock the door behind me as he I walking up. I start sputtering out my truck broke as he is reaching for his gun. Luckily I didn't get shot. He was actually nice enough to call 2 other cops. 1 to block traffic and want to jumpstart my truck so I could get home safe."

"I've been a nanny for a really long time. When I interview for a new job parents often ask what about me justifies my high salary. I ask them to think about that time they snapped, that parenting moment they are so ashamed of, the one that they dwell on and feel guilty about. 

Then I tell them that in all the years I've been a nanny, I've never had that moment. That I've never snapped on a kid and thrown something, hit them, screamed at them. They're not so much paying me to teach their kid to count, the ABC's, to be well adjusted human beings, many nannies can do that, they're paying me for my many years of even tempered  rationality even when a kid has just stepped on my last nerve. They're paying my all that money because they can be 100% sure that even in the middle of the night when I've been awake for days and a toddler has just smeared shit all over the walls and bed I'll handle it calmly and without turning into an asshole to the kids. 

It's a huge help that I get to have breaks, I get the luxury of having time off from the kids. It's why I try so hard to stress to parents that they have to take care of themselves first. Parenting isn't a sprint, it's a marathon and you have to save something for the years ahead.

It also helps the life taker feel as if their actions had no contribution to the incident. 

On a personal note, I don‚Äôt feel terribly bad for a murderer (or equivalent crime) dying as a result of his / her actions. But I find myself sad thinking about all the years the murderer could have changed course but didn‚Äôt. 

It reminds me of the times I‚Äôve warned a 12 year old that if he doesn‚Äôt straighten up, he is going to end up on an RIP t-shirt. Only to wait 5 years to find out i was right. I was sad the boy I knew was dead, but not said the would-be drive by didn‚Äôt happen. "
"My father was a locomotive engineer for about twelve years, and this is exactly what he‚Äôd tell me. A lot of people choose to commit suicide by train. Locomotives weigh several thousand tons at least, and sometimes can take upwards of a mile to come to a complete stop. So if the person doesn‚Äôt move, there‚Äôs literally nothing you can do. Dad said he‚Äôd speed the train up to make it quicker for them once he knew they weren‚Äôt gonna move and he‚Äôd gone through all of the steps (blaring the horn, etc). He even hit someone who wanted to take his whole family with him in a minivan once. Shit‚Äôs fucked up, man. "
‚ÄúLet me show you‚Äù 
Ha ha yes I have. 
"Not until I had kids did I realize how much self control is required.  Not making excuses for these purple, but it's easy to see how someone who isn't as mentally stable could shake a baby."
"When I was a kid, my mom would tell my sister (6 years older than me, but we were very young during the time of this story) and me that whoever got into the front seat first would get dropped off at school last. Well, one day after she said that, we both took off running to the car, and my sister beat me to the front seat. As she got in, I pulled on her arm a little like I was playfully going to pull her out. She looked me dead in the eyes and slammed the car door on my arm/wrist, and I passed out. She ended up spraining my arm, and I had to wear a sling for a few weeks. Growing up she did a lot of fucked up shit to me.
But since I was taken to the doctor right away, I obviously got to school last that day. "
Aaanddd that's enough internet for the day
The Show Must Go On
Golf clap  
"That's what I was about to say, he was happy.

Listen to his wife's stories and you'll see evidence that he realised he had dementia and so didn't want to become a breathing human without any sense in the world, which is a common thing to do."
"Lost it at ""hid my bong"" lol"
"Terrible gift idea. Its never a good idea to make a fool out of anybody.

Its worse to make a fool out of a friend

Its much much worse to make a fool out of someone who is suffering so greatly.

And its infinitely worse to intentionally give them hope just so you can cut them down into bitter disappointment."
"Robin Williams WAS happy, he developed Lewy body disease, and the dementia ran its course on him. His wife wrote a pretty heart breaking [letter](http://m.neurology.org/content/87/13/1308.full) about what was really going on with him in his final years/months."
"1 day, 2 years tops"
"I think it's stupid to fire people for doing stupid and unpredictable mistakes. It 's not like you don't know how to do your job, and now they need to hire someone new who could potentially do the same mistake, where as the one who has already done it would not do it again. Mistakes happen, and their insurance covered it. 

And who even uses 5000$ to paint a wall with a paint that gets ruined when you put a tape on it and doesn't even tell people to be carefull? I'd say this was totally on them, not you. "
I‚Äôll have to think of this next time
I love how you got downvoted for being concerned
Probably....
It‚Äôs difficult to compose when being caught off guard :( 
"Tell Marcellus to call mister Wolfe, he'll know what to do. "
"Yeah your 10 yo is only going to get more argumentative with her mother with age tbh, take it from a girl who was once that young. Don't beat yourself up, take a deep breath and a few minutes to yourself and then wrangle your little adorable demon in. Life'll go on and you'll laugh about this in a week."
Yeah that's because this is a completely bullshit story that is ultimately just advertisement for his web comics. 
A chance Crappening
She'll tell you that she's OK now (but that might just be the drugs talking).  At her last appointment the doctor said she's healing nicely and she gets her patches off tomorrow.  First few days were pretty rough tho.  Now it looks like her vision will be the same so it's easier to talk about.  
It exploded as soon as she took it out and set it on the counter.
Came here to post just about the same thing. More than likely a super lazy sound guy
"What company spends $5000 to paint a fucking wall. Seriously, I want to boycott them because they're that fucking dumb."
Seems like a common mistake. I wonder how many Pyrex Pirates are walking around out there today?
"&gt;I've lost a good friend.

On the upside she lost a *super* shitty friend. So at least something good came of it. "
"please tell me at least one of the people in the audience was recording this

also, my condolences"
"So true ... sleep deprivation (especially on a constant basis) *really* impares your judgment to an unbelievable extent. My mom (who had 3 kids in 4.5 yrs) said she remembered reading in the news one day about how a frustrated mother shook her baby causing permanent brain damage and her first reaction was a horrified, ""That could have been *me* !"" 

Btw this is coming from my awesome mom who always loved and supported us &amp; gave us the best childhood... every parent deals with the frustration and anger at some point and I think it's something that should be more openly discussed. "
where's the vid?
Did you get tested again? False positives happen all the time with blood tests.
"Draining the lizard, cross cross Apple sauce sitter, meat missile, glue uzi. Yet you also say cock. Pretty weird narrative. "
Those cops need to watch cops. You u always search under the bed
"I clean up crime and trauma scenes for a living. There are definately companies that can clean your car for you, and it is usually covered by auto insurance if you have full coverage.

You could have mechanical damage to your car, and a mechanic isn't going to touch it until it has been properly cleaned and decontaminated.

I have cleaned several cars that have run over a person, and the cost runs $4,000 to $10,000 depending on how much disassembly is needed. At the least, they will have to take apart the wheels and brakes to clean everything."
LOL at least the intentions were good..:
Were you listening to [this song](https://youtu.be/k7in-9E3ImQ) by any chance? 
I also found a similar looking thing of superglue on a separate occurance. I was lucky enough to catch that one before it was too late.
As someone who has found shit on the floor of the bathroom at work... this sort of infuriated me lol... at least make it to the toilet like a grown up 
He hasn‚Äôt stopped apologising!! I think he thinks he might get the rest of his BJ later......
I thought it was hilarious. Hubs was pissed and gagging LOL.
"Can you say with complete confidence that this was a centipede crawling onto your ass, rather than some parasite crawling out of your ass? Get to a doctor."
The parents real secret was to acquire a taste for the ginger beer before hand. 
"who would win?

A meme or /u/Tyler1492 ?"
"This. OP and most of the comments are making out as though this is a fault on the civilian's end - as opposed to a systemic issue with trigger happiness. The only police force I've had experience with is the SAPOL in Australia and as far as I know cops can go their full careers without drawing their sidearm. 

Slippery slope if we start calling our own completely innocent actions ""Fuck ups"" just because of the completely disproportionate police response it elicits."
"And physically unless OP manages to scrape him off completely.

"
Never ever do this in the United States if you pulled over. They will think you are high and violent and in the base case situation order you to lay face first on the pavement until they can address and question wheter you are crazy.
"Lol. ""Absence"" as pregnancy deterrent.

""Can't have sex with me if I'm not there!"""
This is a man who speaks from experience.
That's not the worst way he could've hidden that little chocolate truffle
I all lost on this day.
Damn bro
"Not going to lie, the trophy post spoiled me with media-laced TIFU's"
I find it amazing that you made 3 distinct different tones simultaneously to form a B flat minor triad.  Didn‚Äôt know that was possible. 
"This is like a story I read for English... a little. Woman borrowed a diamond necklace from a friend, lost it, worked herself and her husband into debt for twenty years to replace it, then found out it was made of false diamonds. The lesson was to just own up to your fuck ups... because little fuck ups might turn into big fuck ups. "
I don't see anything in a gold wall in your ig. 
@op please?
Make sure you check the tip of the buttplug for centipede eggs first.
"I'm here to show you the wonders of a butt plug. No super glue needed, unless you want it? Extra protection."
"I onetime has a hermit threaten to shoot me because I walked in his ditch. Guy had to be insane. I was a 10 yr old kid who was walking on a PUBLIC TRAIL when I was climbing on some rocks and accidentally stepped into a ditch on the side of the path. The guy freaked out and told me that he would shoot me if I took a step off of the PUBLIC TRAIL.  We later came back down the trail to see a sign that said ‚Äútrespassers will be shot on sight‚Äù

There‚Äôs a 0% chance that the guy had any right to live there as it was on a national preservation where no one lived for miles. "
IIRC it was part of a push in the 90s where drug cookers were using Pyrex dishes to cook and they were pushed to change materials to things that couldn't handle the heat needed to make the drugs
I was expecting let the bodies hit the floor
you laughed the cop laughed and your license plate laughed - then you both shot the plate - damn mimicks 
Did you contact her?  She may not know she has it?
"Can you imagine being that centipede in his last moments? Just chilling in a dark damp place just to get swiped away why a floating blanket into a bunch of fresh shit. Then hearing screams as the shit you're stuck in ruptures into an earthquake and pinches you in half watching your bottom have sink to the bottom the the toilet while the upper half is impacted in pieces of shit being grinded away over and over.


Intense."
Well isn't that a shame
"I honestly cannot think of a situation where this would end well. I'm already imagining handing one to my friend who's a single parent with twins, my sister who barely got her own apartment, or even my parents. I know for a fact it would end with them extremely pissed off..."
