"Just because there is an understandable explanation doesn't mean it is still not ridiculous. It's probably some sort of coping or defense mechanism of his, and he may not even realize he is doing it, or why he is doing it. But it is still an inappropriate response for an adult. Hopefully they can get to the bottom of things together and work on it. "
He's continuously touching you in a sexual way without getting your consent and then he tries to coerce you into consenting when you protest. That's sexual assault.
Therapy and have you thought about adoption?
"He needs to learn how to calm himself down without smoking. It’s not a big deal to smoke pot but it sounds like he’s become dependent on it. There are better ways to cope with stress/anxiety then lashing out at your partner over a minor mistake that is easily fixed. 

Reiterate to him that it is not OK for him to treat you disrespectfully like that and he needs to learn some better coping skills. If he starts yelling at you like that again feel free to end the conversation and leave. "
This sounds like a combination of factors but depression sounds like the biggest factor.  
"If you just take them for a few days, you aren't going to have many withdrawal symptoms, I don't think.  You aren't going to see any effects either"
Too soon to move in with a boyfriend. You’re going to have to get over it. It’s not abnormal in my city for men and women to be roommates.
"Ummm, there's literally no evidence that this is true. "
"When you are married to an abuser, nothing you can do will change them.  Couples counseling is not recommended because whatever you expose in therapy, she will use against you.

SHE needs to admit she's being abusive and go seek help on her own.  If that doesn't happen, this will only continue to get worse.

It is not ""giving up"" to walk away from an abuser, it's doing the right thing.  You can only control yourself.  She chooses to abuse you, it's not accidental."
"This sounds like a nightmare. Can you stay in a hotel for a night or two just to get some sleep? 

Tell him his behavior has you questioning the marriage and your decision to uproot your life. "
"I don't see how looking at public posts on social media is stalking someone, honestly"
"Aggressive behavior can somewhat be modified with training, but a strong prey drive can be hard to change.  Your dog would be better off in a home with experienced dogowners and no other pets/children.  I don’t think any amount of internet advice will help a novice dogowner (such as yourself) train an older, aggressive dog.  

I also don’t understand why you won’t use a crate.  A crate is not a punishment.  A crate is the dog’s den, his safe space.  You can use the crate as the starting point of his training.  

Anyways here are some tips to get you going.  Keep the dog separated from the rest of the animals by keeping him in a separate room.  Don’t use enclosures to isolate the dog, you have too many agile pets.  Use the dog’s meal as a training tool.  Make him sit and calm down before giving him his meal.  (Some people will take issue with this as it is similar to dominance training, but it is really not that cruel).  Reward him for good behavior with treats using consistent commands or a clicker.  Exercise him so he can focus better."
"I spoke to a divorce attorney late last year and she thinks I have a good shot at primary custody, especially since my wife has threatened to take off with the baby under those circumstances. I currently have two hidden recording devices at home, and I'm waiting for her to make the same threat again on a recording, which will help in divorce court. 

But what I really want is for her to come to her senses one way or another, because the best thing for our daughter is to grow up in a healthy two-parent household. I had one of those growing up, but my wife did not, and the differences are immediately obvious. "
"I left some details out in the post accidentally. One of my first mentions to her was that she could choose any appetizer/dessert she wanted and there was no need for a full meal if she didn't desire it! I told her to drive to Outback, multiple times, but she made it seem like she didn't want to go and continuously refused. I'm not necessarily trying to blame her though, I should have taken charge more and not even consider other options. Though, I guess I'm more practical in that sense as I do tend to look for compromises rather than settling (until the stress gets to me lol).

Thanks for your insight! :)"
Sounds like he wants a live in girlfriend during the week but wants the single life at the weekend.Has he another girlfriend at home?
Before his wife ends up on [r/JustNoSO](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/)
"Your husband sounds very hard headed but a lot of factors can lead to ED. Stress, Trauma and testosterone are some of the most common. What does he do for a job? I work in the military and law enforcement so I’ve had my fair share of ED moments"
"My wife does something similar, but we didn't go to therapy. We decided that she needs to highlight whether this is her venting, if this is a two-way discussion, or if she is looking for actual advice to make a decision.

During the venting, I literally just tune her out. She knows this. She isn't happy about it, but I can't listen to someone talk **at** me and not want my opinion on stuff. I think it's fucking rude, so our compromise is that she can talk at me all she wants, but I'm not necessarily going to listen. It helps her to talk it through out loud, she doesn't feel crazy just talking to herself, and I get to browse Reddit while saying ""uh-huh"" or ""well that's stupid"" every so often."
What the hell? No dude. You had your chance with this guy and he moved on. Don't be a homewrecker. It makes you a shitty person.
"I mean to be fair I'm keeping 'score' too, but that's mainly to keep from feeling like I'm going insane.

I recognize that her cat predates me and is important to her, and as she says unlike me, she can't explain to her cat why she is ""abandoning him"", however I feel like the compromise is like the bare minimum I can take, and I'm getting less than that.

If you want beans, I could say that she hasn't cooked a meal since she moved in, apart from sometimes taking over what i've started on a handful of times."

"He doesn't sound terrible. He's trying to give another perspective, how his parents may be viewing this.  I would say asking grandparents who live an hour away to wait 4 weeks to see their grandbaby isn't normal and they're having a hard time wrapping their head around it. He's not terrible for giving a different opinion and perspective. Sheesh."
"If you say no, and you don't stick to your no, then your no means nothing. Enforce your boundaries, or you will be walked over."
The big deal is that his parents are tramping all over their decisions here. Where will it end now if they give in to this? What happens if the baby is a bit older and they don't respect parenting decisions he and his wife agree to?
"Maybe I'd have agreed with this if the grandfather hadn't yelled and screamed and threatened in the face of a simple boundary. Is a month a bit long? Maybe, but that's the boundary they agreed on. If the grandparents wanted to meet the grandkid sooner, maybe THEY could have taken the reasonable route and suggested something like what you suggested. But once someone screams and threatens, why should they be trusted? Especially with a newborn, if my in-laws behaved this way I would not feel very safe."
"Thanks to my great-aunt Ruth I spend a total of zero. But we had the rings appraised for insurance reasons and they are worth quite a bit less than $10,000."
"I don't think the issue is that you are not 100% the fantasy of a woman that your husband imagines. The problem is that *he* thinks this is a problem AND he has told you that this is a problem for him. 

I actually don't know what my husband's fantasy woman is like. I have my suspicions, but I don't know for sure because he has never told me. And why would he? What would it accomplish other than making me insecure and driving a wedge between us? God, I cannot imagine having to listen to some man whine about how I'm not the perfect amalgamation of his masturbation fantasies from his formative years. 

It is a *bad sign* that your husband realizes that his ""dream woman"" is probably unattainable but still dumps this on you every few months. Him vocalizing these issues isn't going to change you into that woman. All it does is make you feel like shit. So he thinks it's okay to make you feel like crap about yourself over a problem that you cannot solve every 2-3 months. Wow.

I don't think it's your responsibility to help him work through this. This is something he needs to see a therapist to address. Why is he clinging to this fantasy woman? Why is he burdening you with this problem? 

You could also consider going to couple's therapy if you want to work through this problem. It could be that he does have legitimate issues with your current relationship, but isn't introspective enough to figure out what they are. For example, he might be bored with your day to day life and he imagines that this fantasy sporty woman would bring more excitement to his life. So the actual problem is boredom and he is convincing himself that this magic woman would fix the problem because that is easier than trying to figure out how to solve this himself. He also might feel like the spark has gone out and you guys don't flirt as much, so this fantasy woman that is great at sexy banter would always be amping up the sexual tension by flirting in conversation. Again, this removes his own responsibility to fix the problem by making it something that is your fault that some other women wouldn't do. That, of course, is stupid because maintaining movie levels of flirtatious banter isn't realistic in long term relationships and you need to find more sustainable ways to keep that mysterious spark in your relationship.

Anyway, I bet that your fiance is freaking out about not having honeymoon levels of sexual tension and excitement in your lives and instead of understanding that this is normal and you can work on fixing it, he imagines a fantasy woman that has the powers to elevate a relationship above these (totally normal) problems. "
Now I must say that I’m not a saint either. I definitely have some anger issues. I have a very short fuse but I think that I’m better at being responsible than he is. I am careless every once in a while. I get mad instanly when he wakes up in the afternoon and walks out of the bedroom like nothing is wrong. I raise my voice and don’t want to talk to him during the day because of how pissed I am. 
"&gt;The grass isn't greener on the other side of the fence, the grass is greenest where you water it.

Yep. But make sure he waters it too. Because water **is** a big part of intimacy for some."
"No, there is no question about the money.  The money is hers.  They do not cohabitate, there has been no discussion of a future that involves merging finances.  And no, she ""shouldn't have anticipated"" that one day they would, so she should have put her money aside for that moment.

Which did not come, by the way.  "
"in a previous post that OP has since deleted in /r/relationships with similar advice, she completely disregarded it :(

the post signified that her boyfriend (of then two weeks) wanted her to throw out all things and gifts she has received from past boyfriends. she either did not listen to the comments that warned him that he is showing signs of abuse / insecurity / control or she's already stuck..."
"If you're not going to call off the wedding then postpone it until you're 100% sure you know what you want to do.

If there's no attraction and no connection then what would your marriage be? You'll just be roommates. Is that how you want your life? 50 more years of this?"
"I live with this girl. She does not have depression. Even if she did it does not negate the fact that she’s a living nightmare. 

If I make her the wrong food. She screams. If I don’t get her something fast enough, she yells. If what I make for her isn’t good enough she will literally toss it at me or on the floor. She’s broken my phone because she thinks I’m talking to chicks. I’m not. Don’t have the fucking time. But it’s totally ok for her to mess around with other guys.

She sold my PlayStation and my bike while I was at work. She’s thrown away important pictures I had. She threw away the only pictures I had of my dad and the birthday cards he’d sent me. He’s dead. Those things were irreplaceable.

The list goes on and on."
"More importantly, IMO, it sounds like OP is doing potentially irrevocable damage to his girlfriend's self-esteem in the process. She looked the same way when they started the relationship. I can't imagine being in a relationship where I had always looked the same but was now having to ask my partner to please just fantasize about someone else while we had sex because they were actively telling me that they weren't attracted to me to the point of it being a deal-breaker."
"I was in a similar boat. I was 19, had been with my bf since i was 13. All we knew was each other. He stopped putting in effort. I mean seriously, he played video games constantly, didn't contribute around the house, we stopped having adventures and the relationship felt more like roommates.

I ended it because i thought there had to be more out there. He spent several years trying to get me back, and hasn't had anything lasting since and we broke up about 7 years ago.

I'm currently dating someone I've been friends with since around the time of that break up. We've been together 2 and a half years and I'm extremely happy with him. We have a lot of staying in days, especially in the colder months, because we're both just starting our careers but I'm never bored. We have movie marathons, play board games or video games together, cook together or play with our dogs. 

See, if my first boyfriend had continued to make an effort when we were together, we'd probably be married now. If we had turned towards each other instead of away from each other.. 

With my current bf we turn to each other for everything, we problem solve if theres an issue, we're partners. One thing I've learned is in long relationships its easy to get complacent and stop trying and get bored and be curious about whats out there.. the grass is always greener syndrome. When i was single for years, I'd think about the security i had in my first bf and wish I'd tried harder. 

Truth is there is no right answer for your problem. Committment is about choosing that person every day. If you don't choose her, then don't be in the relationship. You're curious about whats out there, maybe theres a hotter girl or a girl whose more fun you could be with and there probably is. But theres always going to be a hotter girl no matter who you're with. So whatever you do, realize that we always want what we don't have, and one of the hardest parts of life is being happy with what you have. "
"I like this. This is like the inverse of my suggestion, which was have the wife come up with a plan to manage her own mental health (which in itself is a step in the right direction, and forces her to identify/recognize the issues and weaknesses that a pregnancy would exacerbate on her own rather than having it handed to her). But this would also help OP, because then he would know what he really needs to be comfortable with the idea. 

Perhaps they should each come up with a plan and compare to see where the gaps are. Best of both worlds. Of course it's possible OPs list is ""nothing will convince me to have a second child,"" and that's also fine."
"IT'S A TRAP!

The reason they're trying this is so they can interfere with and control your life again. Your mother would absolutely try to control you like your brother but you proved you would resist and get away from her control. Now she's trying to lure you back with an apartment you don't want. Think about what this will mean. They're not signing it over to you, they're going to own it. So think of every landlord problem ever but it's your parents who expect you to take care of it on your own dime because they 'gave' you the apartment. Want to redecorate, renovate, change anything? Not in THEIR apartment! And they'll have keys, and always feel like they can waltz in whenever they want, since it's THEIR apartment. They'll never respect your rights as a tenant.

If they want to buy you an apartment, they can give you the money and let you buy an apartment that YOU want. But they don't want that, because it's not about getting you a home you want and supporting you, it's about putting you under their control again."
"He is deceitful , he goes behind your back and tries to hook up with people. He has poor judgment for getting you involved in his young daughters' lives so fast. he blame games you and gives you the silent treatment.

Hes a shitty person depsite his good qualities.

Would you eat a wonderful ham, cheese and shit sandwich bc the ham and cheese are so great?  I hope not."
"&gt; This is a really poor reason to bring a child into the world.

I know and I feel like she knows but she has so much anxiety.  Every time she is alone with her family, she comes back to this line of thought. "
"You can't make her feel differently about it.  If this isn't something she can get over, it sounds like this isn't going to work.  If that is the case, be assured that she wasn't the right one for you."
Then break from him for a while. Protect yourself and your birth control.
Then ask your obgyn to tell him why it's not a good idea and what another pregnancy might do to you - and the baby.
"right? it doesn’t sound like a relationship- it’s more like a sociology phd thesis.  no wonder they’re unhappy.  

try just seeing how you both  _feel_  without labeling it, OP. "
"I tried doing the cooking together thing - it ended up with me making food and desert on my own and her watching. I just feel like I'm her dad, not her boyfriend

I don't wanna constantly be nagging and asking for help, I want her to want to help me because she sees me putting in effort"
LOL they won't buy any because they don't care enough now it's not free.
"First of all, the run-on sentences and lack of line breaks make this really hard to read. Seriously, this was nearly incomprehensible.

Secondly, you threw something to punish her for not behaving like you wanted her to. She ought to leave you because clearly you're not safe to be around! Don't just go to counseling to manipulate her into staying with you. If you really loved and respected her, you would never have done this. Go to counseling so you won't do this to the next person you date."
"I think everyone realizes the time suck, the same way that all addicts realize they're doing something wrong but can't help but keep going because it feels good."
"You acknowledge how wrong it is to base someone's value on how many sexual partners have. You realise that just because she didn't save herself for you doesn't mean she loves you any less. It's not fair that you let your insecurities impact her - there's literally nothing she can do about her past.

You can either accept that your partner has had sex before you. Or you choose not to, drive her away with your insecurity, and learn the hard way when you're no longer a virgin and go into your next relationship. "
"6 months to see other people? That's bullshit. Either you see other people and then decide you want to stay with her because no one else compares and you got everything out of your system - which is a horrible thing to do, or you decide to break up in the end, which is also horrible because you strung her along for 6 months. If you want to explore, you lose her forever. You can't just keep her on the back burner. "
"Women like that wife annoy the shit out of me, because they’re the first to throw other women under the bus and then claim it’s because they’re just stronger, more superior women than the rest of us lowly peasants who have been conditioned to remain silent when abused or harassed. "
"~~You're enabling your spoiled brothers. They could learn how to do these very basic tasks, but why should they have to, because even when mommy #1 isn't around, mommy #2 (you) will come and wait on them hand and food.~~

~~Ignore your grandma. She's the selfish one. Go, you're the most important person in your own life. If you won't take care of yourself, nobody else will. Go. Leave. Go take that test, and take some time to yourself. Let your mother's house fall into a dirty mess. It's not your responsibility.~~

Edit: Actually, nevermind. Reading all of your responses here, you don't seem to have any interest to actually fix your problems. The only way that things are going to change is if *you* change them. You're looking for some magic words that will convince your brothers to stop being spoiled, your grandmother to stop being lazy and entitled, and your mother to stop being a narcissist. *Those words do not exist.* You have my sympathy, but I don't understand why you even bothered posting here if you are going to have excuse after excuse to as why you refuse to actually change your situation."
"I absolutely don't mean to sound mean, but yes this will definitely be a problem. Your girlfriend does not want to marry you because she knows the trouble that lies ahead. Shes smart. If you really want to marry this girl, you have to change . Giving her an ultimatum will backfire, and isn't right to do."
"Sometimes, small conflicts are indicators of big issues. 

Tell her that she is responsible for her own body, mind, emotions, and sleep cycle, and you are responsible for yours. If she cannot accept that, then you should both move on, no harm, no foul. Unless you are dealing with a baby or toddler, somebody who wants to make you responsible for these things is not partner material. 

She sounds like she may be the type who has to win every conflict. If so, this is not a person you want in a relationship either. "
"&gt; this dude needs to work through some shit. I imagine he's dealing with some emotional stuff that he doesn't know how to deal with effectively, 

Agreed 100%"
He seems happy when we are alone together. He doesn't like the in-laws stuff much because he's bored if I spend too much time with my mom without him. 
"In my opinion, things seem to be more consistent with ""Sean is an abusive asshole"" than ""Sophia is lying"". Her parts of the story check out, Sean is being decidedly weird, and Josh's reaction is exactly what I would expect to see from someone who didn't believe that his friend's on-again, off-again girlfriend was being abused. The very public makeouts are also consistent with what she describes - it's a way of publicly asserting posession.

Sean does not need to own the entire town for this to work - all we've seen is that he has one very loyal friend (Josh), that he has a brother in the police department, and that he has evidently convinced Sophia that everyone's on his side.

The best option would be to get Sophia a bus ticket somewhere else, preferably somewhere where she has old friends or distant family members, especially if they are people Sean made her cut ties with.  You should NOT start dating her: right now, she's in an abusive relationship and thinks she NEEDS you to rescue her, so she can't freely choose. And in the (unlikely, IMO) event that she's lying about Sean, getting her away from him would be the best thing anyone could do for him.

I don't think it's at all likely that she's trying to run away from the police - right now, she's got a contact in the police department, which she'll give up the moment she splits with Sean.

You should make sure someone you trust (preferably someone who lives far away from Sean and therefore cannot actually tell him any of this) knows the full story."
"Not a trans thing, but a coworker of mine changed her name completely. A year or two later, despite me knowing her new name and using it a lot previously, one time I saw her in passing and was like Hey OldName! It just slipped out and I didn’t even notice until a few minutes later after I’d left, and I didn’t see her again for a week or two. I felt awkward."
Be the person you want to be with. Invest all that energy into loving yourself. Explore interests and hobbies and career advancement and just loving and investing in *you* instead of trying to attract a partner. Fulfill your own emotional needs by making yourself awesome. 
Thank you.
"my intuition is telling me that you posted this in order to confirm from strangers what you already believe: that your BF is incredibly disrespectful to your body. 

look, my wife is hot. ill randomly grab her from time to time if we're in close proximity. do you know why i feel comfortable doing this with my attractive partner? because i dont do it at inappropriate or rude times, and because i know (explicitly) because she likes it (in the right situation)

you know when i dont do this? when we're having a conversation, or she's talking, or basically any OTHER situation besides being mutually frisky.

if my wife ever said to me (especially on repeat) that she didnt like it when i do this to her i would be horrified and feel awful for making her feel like i wasnt listening to her...

he's being a rude asshole, and while 4 years feels like a long time its a drop in the bucket of a marriage, it sounds like it will get way WORSE."
"&gt; Even though found innocent, I was still uneasy about it all. That's another reason I wanted to meet in a public place.

WHY MEET AT ALL. He hit her repeatedly in the face with a close fist? What explanation did you want to hear? She had a bee on her face? "
You're just going to have to say it. I would honestly prepare yourself for a break up. Please tell me you guys didn't trade any explicit material before you turned 18?
"Oh no that's not what happened. I asked him about it before we all went on vacation and he got really defensive so I let it go. Then my family teased him about it and he REALLY got upset. 

He just won't talk it about. He says they're his feet and his socks and he'll wear them if he wants and he doesn't care what anyone thinks so drop it. "
"Also ""making fun of the fact that I was a virgin when we met"" really upset me. In other words, you were no longer a virgin after you met.

PLEASE get counseling before entering into a new relationship. You need to realize you are worth more than scum like this."
Yeah I highly doubt she threw that money away. It was just said to get a reaction.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with having your own support system when someone you love is injured or ill. There is a LOT wrong with becoming completely emotionally and physically unavailable but still stringing along the person you're claiming to be inconsolable about.
"Hell, she should go past ""shocked"" to ""why the hell did you just say that?"""
"Your right he doesn't respect you. 
Is marriage therapy an option or divorce? "
"The only person lashing out here is you. Filling in the blanks that OP's boyfriend's family are trying to get him to find a partner who will take care of him when he does move out isn't a huge leap. Joking that he'll be eating take out the rest of his life if she doesn't learn to cook is some grade A bullshit, &amp; shows they want him to be with someone who cater to his needs. I've seen it before OP, I dated a guy who's mother coddled him so hard that when I told him to use some elbow grease he asked me where we kept it, it's behavior that needs to be addressed. "
"You sound like a crazy person. Are you in therapy? 

""A difference of opinion on clothes"" hes a baby. Babies need to be bundled
 
""May have skipped a few baths""
Uhhhhhh he shoulsnt be skipping any. And like..... they probably wouldnt intervene unless ur kid was definitely seriously  gross. (Ive worked with kids. Its expected they be a lil nasty now ans again.)

I highly doubt that anyone tricked you into getting mental help. If you were committed you probsbly needed it considering youre borderline. (Im bipolar. Ive been there.) Its very easy to live inside of your delusions and believe theyre real. 

Please get into therapy. If your son thinks you react weird. And its very obvious from this post that you do. You sound envious because you neglected him as a kid (even if its because od ur mental health issues. The fact remains that you in fact did.) Now hes bonded with SIL. Its not out of malice or spite. It just happened. 

If you want to fix it work hard. Try to get to know him at HIS level. Dont be pushy. Dont force him to do anything. 

And for the love of God do NOT cut your SIL out. Youd be on the fast track for fucking your kid up worse."
"How does he not realize that when he's a 49 year old going after a 19 year old, obviously only in it for the sex. Like duh dude you're going after her for shallow reasons, you can't figure out she's with you for shallow reasons too?"
"I know this clearly must work for you but... man, that sounds really upsetting from my view that you have to have an agreement that he cuddles you after sex instead of him wanting to. I know that would make me really sad. How do you cope with that?"
Thank you for saying this. My blood is boiling reading her replies and I'm finding it hard to be civil.

"Honestly, I think you’re being a little petty. He pays his proportionate share of household and bills based on his income (i.e. more than you) and just happens to have more disposable income than you do at the end of it all. If you weren’t saving for school (which you are choosing to do, so think of that as a “me” expense), would you have a proportionate amount of disposable income? 

He didn’t blindside you with this. He explained his experience with a past marriage, and you accepted it; but it seems that since you started saving for school, you have less money for fun things, and seeing him buy new toys bothers you, which again—I really don’t think is fair. "
"After you tell her no,remember to freeze your credit in case she decides to open a credit card in your name or steal your identity.

I know right now you’re probably appalled and thinking “what is this internet stranger saying, my mom would never!” But lots of people thought so and ended up saddled with tons of debts because their parents screwed them over and they either couldn’t prove the identity theft or weren’t willing to send mommy and daddy to jail. 

Nobody was ever betrayed by somebody they distrusted in first place. Also, she never has to know you’re doing it - or that you’re doing it because of her."
Don't drink and Reddit 
Why are you even with this guy? I see zero redeeming qualities from anything in your post. Just break up with him already.
"Well, she was a child when you guys got married, and now she’s getting her (first?) taste of independence.  What else would you expect?  She’s just having some overdue fun."

"Funny story but I’m a first time mom too. A month before my due date, in the dead of summer, my husbands friends and I all went hunting for Pokémon. Then we headed back to chill to movies and video games. It was probably like the party your husband was heading to. But my back hurt real bad and I couldn’t get comfortable so we went home early. 

Walking in that heat triggered labor. My back hurting was active labor. I was halfway dialated by the time I woke up. I’m glad I didn’t know because I slept through the night. 

Babies definitely can come at any time. She was fortunately healthy and happy and she’s snoring next to us right now. "
yep. He is at like -999 instead of -1000
"At first they probably didn't invite you guys over because that would have meant inviting everyone, including your Dad and his new lady. Seeing that new lady was probably maddening to the aunts and uncles that just lost their sister.

But then it became force of habit. And instead of thinking about what they were doing, the wrote off the entire family including you guys. Now you're in the space of their mind that isn't quite family. It's tempting to call them up and bitch them out. I wouldn't blame you if you did.

Others will say the classy thing to do is never rely on them again. Keep the memories of your mother to yourself and don't try to reach out to them. Be polite where they're not, and keep your distance.

Or feel free to have a heart to heart with someone in the moment. It'll probably blow up but it might blow up in a cathartic way."
"Glad to hear it.

Now go start making a list of your favorite girl names, bring home matching Big Sister shirts and  a Little Sister onesie, plan something special with your two girls, and overall start rebuilding your wife's faith in your excitement about the new baby.

"You're right that I am kind of over-complicating this.

I've been thinking that I'll say something along the lines of what you mentioned in your reply. However, I did want to check here to see if there was in fact a better way to go about responding to this situation. Some of the advice that I see on this subreddit makes me think to myself, ""damn, that's excellent advice. If I ever find myself in that situation, I will be sure to remember what that person said on reddit.""

Thank you for your advice!"

"you might not have blown it but you should have definitely given her space. anxiety and depression are serious issues and people often cancel/reschedule plans because it gets too much to handle. give her a couple of days to calm down and text her something simple and short, “are you still up for that date? no worries, just looking forward to hanging out/going out with you!” 

if she ever mentions feeling uncomfortable again, back off but assure her you’re around if she needs someone to talk to or just needs someone to listen or just a simple “sorry about that, i’ll be here when you’re ready”. "
"The first time I went to my boyfriend’s house (so we’d been dating about 2 weeks), I got sick all of a sudden and needed to throw up. He looked at me and said “are you okay?” And all I could do was shake my head. He leapt into action and grabbed a bag which I immediately threw up into.. while he was holding it. I was SO mortified, but he was so sweet about it! Had me lie down and rubbed my back, made me a peppermint tea, and kept reassuring me that it was fine and I shouldn’t be embarrassed. The way he handled the situation and took care of me told me so much about the kind of person he was. It’s going to be our one year anniversary this Friday :)"
"Some people really buy into that ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" lifestyle mentality.

"As a CS major myself, holy heck. Your dad is giving him the opportunity of a lifetime (guidance, not handing him a job) and he’s really missing out. University leaves you often feeling totally unprepared in this industry, and Impostors Syndrome is really common-your Dad is being great.



That said, your BF sounds either entitled, or depressed. My money is on the later. It’s a stressful degree and CS can be a stressful industry. Just try picking a job where (most jobs, out of university) seem like they are only hiring the academically smart, “passionate”, in a field that literally changes week by week and is not easy to keep up with. There is a lot of pressure. Programming comes easy to some, but not all, and depression/anxiety is VERY common in this field, especially around your BFs life milestone (just graduated). Your BF really needs to open himself up to the idea of therapy and getting support. Not only for his degree/experience, but it sounds like his family life likely impacted him as well, although I cannot speak to that. 



I know that probably didn’t help the situation, but I want you to know that what you seem to have already noticed is not uncommon, and I agree he would do well with professional support. 


If you can get him out, going to meet ups, hack Nights, etc, maybe he can network and gain some confidence back, get to know people and the industry outside your dad (someone who he’s currently reliant on for housing? Financials?). Google “programming meetup” in your city for a language or concept he likes (java, mobile, games, etc). It’s a good way to get to know others and meet recruiters and hone his skills. It’s also a space where he may discover that it’s not easy for everyone - I’ve gone to specific dev meet ups on anxiety and impostors syndrome and health/wellness. They are big topics. "

Tell him that you don't want to offend his delicate sensibilities again, so the friendship is over.

If he doesn't see you as more than a friend, you can move on and pursue other options. He could reciprocate your feelings and then you can feel more confident and less anxious.

"*They did give me a warning about the way I was calling Kate in the evening about newspaper business and told me to stop that. But they were vague about behavior they specifically wanted me to stop*

They were not vague, it was clear- stop calling her after hours. After reading the rest of your post its obvious you were over bearing to her, putting all your emotional issues on her and unloading during these phone calls. She couldn't let you down nicely so she had the director do it. The behavior you exhibited would have you dismissed in ANY work place. 

You mutter her name subconsciously? It is not normal to be so fixated on someone you said was completely platonic.

Short answer is you need to get in therapy, and fast. ESPECIALLY before you get another job. How do you move on? i dont want to be mean and this is probably harsh, but you learn coping mechanisms from therapy, to prevent any obsessive behavior that has caused you this much trouble in the past. These people were uncomfortable by you, the fact that you are completely oblivious to that, and cant get over it,  means you should talk to a professional about it.

Do not do not do NOT try to contact Kate- She has blocked you for that reason. She has it documented that she does not want you to contact her via her employer."

I'm grossed out by people who dump mayo on everything.  I saw person putting mayo on their pizza and I had a pretty visceral reaction (and also, you are ruining the intended taste of the pizza).  They weren't 'wrong' in doing it (except from a culinary point of view) but I'm also not wrong for finding it disgusting.  I don't think they, as a person, are disgusting.

Ketchup on a steak though, I will judge someone for that.  You are objectively ruining the entire steak and destroying the flavor profile.  Just eat a hamburger at that point.

Go ahead and down vote but ketchup on a steak is straight destroying the steak."

"&gt; My husband like goes all day and doesn’t care if he talks to anyone. 

Yup, some people ski like that. Me too; I’m female. On the few occasions when I got to the Rockies with friends or family, I ditched them after 2 runs. I don’t stop for hot chocolate. I take sandwiches in a plastic grocery bag and I leave them in a snowbank for later. I go to bed early because I’m beat. 

I get your husband.  With my doctor’s blessing, I kept skydiving until I was 18 weeks pregnant, then promptly spent the next 2 weeks backpacking in the Sierras.

I am not a different person after having children. They are 12 and 14. 

Right now, I do ultrarunning. Overall, this one is pretty safe. 

I’m insured for $500k. I’m also honest with my doctor - she fully understands that I’m going to overdo *something*, and it’s just a matter of WHAT I overdo. 

I mean, I DO ski and bike with the kids - they are 12 and 14 now - but nothing has changed with my broken brain.  On Saturday they all threw me out of the house and said, “Don’t come back until you’ve run for five hours at least.”  "
"Oh, honey. I can tell who's being honest, and it's not him. I think deep down you know that too. Aren't you tired of playing these games? You're a mother for goodness sakes. Would you wish this relationship on one of your children? Start learning how to love yourself, if only for the example you're setting for your kids."

"My husband has the same issue for another reason. I wish, wish, wish he'd get them fixed. He also has a chip on his shoulder about it and wont do it. Trust me, she loves you, but she doesn't wanna push what is clearly a sensitive issue. But as someone whose husband wont budge... please just do it for her. He also does the stupid shit of covering his face up in photos and it kills me. It also affects his personal interactions and looks way less professional for his business prospects."
"Even if you've moved on from past trauma, talking about it can bring some of the feelings back to the surface.

I used to be a computer programmer, I had mega ""dyke hair"" and that wasn't an issue. Your A-&gt;B therefore A-&gt;C reasoning is absurd and speaks more of personal issues than anything.

You're more likely to get away with this look if you're middle class and privileged, preferably white. The Sudanese youths who get harassed for simply being in a shopping centre together? They are super clean cut."
Seriously. My biggest problem is their response. Sure there’s plenty of reasons they might have felt uncomfortable telling her. There is not a single justifiable explanation for carrying on flirting and sending fucking kiss emojis back. 
Not to be rude but how do you get prescribed medication after only one visit? I was seeing my psychologist for weeks before she recommended something for me. How can they tell you need something after one session? And like the other person said if it is a benzo then it could be a very bad precedent set.
It’s never okay to follow your kid around screaming while they look for something and then assault them repeatedly. It’s definitely physical abuse and I’m shocked that I’m seeing someone try to defend it. 
"The difference is that people have agency. She isn't a wallet that's been left lying around, she's a teenager who's exploring her identity. Telling her to cover up because men might harass her is teaching her that she doesn't have agency, that she isn't in control of her own actions and her own sexuality. It teaches her that it's her fault if someone assaults her. 

Presumably, as a parent, you'd want her to come forward, speak to the authorities and get proper help if something like that were to happen - but by teaching her that dressing in revealing clothes is ""asking for it"", she'll learn *not* to speak up in that situation. Instead of teaching her accountability, you're teaching her that men can do as they please and face no consequences. 

Instead, teach her that her body and her choices are her own; that behaving inappropriately towards others results in consequences. If you show her that men can do what they want and it's not okay but it's kinda her fault too, she won't learn how to advocate for herself, she won't see accountability in action and she won't feel supported by you - so she won't go to you if someone does assault her.

"Yeah, if it goes to an uncle who just wants it as a sentimental piece or to say, ""Hey look I can afford to put a baby grand in my house!!!"" and doesn't actually know how to play it, then it's not likely he'll ever bother trying to keep it in playable condition to notice it's problems. "
Clearly you two weren’t on the same page about your relationship. She thought it was more than FWB and it sounds like she was pretty blindsided by finding out that you two weren’t exclusive like she thought. Talk to both of these women and clarify what their expectations are for your arrangement before any more hurt feelings surface. You may end up having to end things if she wants something more serious / monogamy
Talk to the financial aid office and see if you can refuse your dad’s money and qualify for scholarships or grants.  Do this for both your current school and te one you wanted to go to

"I would of. It's right to see someone's kid you know ditching school and not say anything. What if something happened to him and his friends when they're not at school? Just a couple of days ago, some loser ran over a bunch of young kids and a mother crossing the street in my city in a hit and run. Melisa and her son have gotten into argument about him being rude to me these past two weeks. She does put her foot down with him. It's just a gut punch to everything going so well to the kid acting so abrasive.

"Co Cou Vin is my very, very favorite!  Since I love chicken, a Chicken Marsala is a biggie in my ""slow cook"" recipes. Also Guinea Hen (  AKA use chicken) with cabbage.

"I wrote another comment for you somewhere else, but I wanted to respond to this one, too. 

Cheating on someone and the situation you're in right now are in no way similar. They *feel* similar right now because you're experiencing grief. When your relationship ended, you felt grief over the ""death"" of the relationship and over a lie. That's okay, but these two things aren't tied together.

The human brain processes things in ways to make them relate to things we've been through before, because we survived that so we can survive this, right? This pain feels similar to that pain, so it's the same thing, right?

Brains are notoriously good at making us feel weird and attach memories of other pains to current ones. Your ex cheating on you was horrible. We can all attest to that. But this isn't the same.

I'll leave you with a Mark Manson quote that resonates with me a lot, because I have felt similar pain to you - both being cheated on and losing someone close to me:

""Our minds biggest priority when processing experiences is to interpret them in such a way that they cohere with all of our previous experiences, feelings and beliefs. But often we run into life situations where past and present don't cohere.""

These two things just don't cohere. Your brain wants it to cohere, because it wants to go through the motions it's already been through."
It’s up to you if course. But what’s wrong with a man seeing your profile online and thinking “wow she’s gorgeous” and sending you a message? 
"I think for most people it’s simply symbolic, but I also don’t know anyone who actually thinks there some tangible significance to the remains. "
That is a worrisome double standard. He encourages and facilitates your son to be sexually active but shames and discourages your daughter from even premarital kissing? 
"Alcohol happened to you. The second that your personality changes like this while drinking, is the second you need to realize that you and alcohol are not going to continue being friends. Ever. No matter how much you want to think otherwise. Believe me, I know. "

"This is dangerous misinformation. I had it straight from the mouth of the police officer who heads our local human trafficking unit. I live in one of the most popular trafficking areas in the US.

I wouldn’t stay married to someone who thought a prostitute was an acceptable gift for their own 18-year-old son. Do you understand that there are many women who won’t even consider him partner material if they discover he once paid for sex?

How did your husband know where to take him, and why was he so comfortable doing so? I think it is deeply naive to assume he isn’t a regular of these sorts of establishments. Places where YES, many of the women are there by force. 

Your son likely participated in what I consider to be rape. And he did it because your husband paid for it. 

I don’t see a way back from this. "
"If he cannot answer that, don't get married. "
"I was very much like your boyfriend in college but I'm a female. Almost exactly identical and I don't think the boundaries you set for him are harsh. I'm now out of college and dating someone who i can partake in these activities with, besides sleeping around obviously. But if he asked me to stop drinking or doing drugs because it negatively affects our relationship or makes me a shitty person (which sounds like it does for your bf) then I would agree to his boundaries. 

Everything in moderation!"
"&gt;I don’t know if he’s able to say no to his mom or how fair it is of me to tell him to

It is 100% fair of you to tell him to say no. You ~~are~~ will be his wife. By custom, by most religions, by law, it is fair for you to tell him. The law is 100% clear on this. How do we know this? If your future husband becomes incapacitated, who would have to make decisions for him, who would be the only person legally able to do so? Not his mama, but YOU. and same for you, legally then your husband is your next of kin, your primary decision maker in the event of coma or some other event that incapacitates you. Unless married couples draw up paperwork eschewing this and designating someone else, this is part and parcel of the marriage contract. So please don't even believe you don't have the right to insist upon such a thing with your husband. Yes, he wants to help his mom but when push comes to shove his loyalty ultimately is with you. 

Your future MIL is going to have to return to work and get a small apartment she can afford. I suggest you tell your fiance that while she and future SIL cannot live with you, perhaps you two can gift her the deposit on a small apartment if you are able. Consider that if you took them in that would easily add at least $400 to your monthly expenses, as one adult generally costs at least another $200 when you consider their utility use, food, misc stuff. So instead of moving them in, gift them a deposit and 1st month's rent somewhere if you can swing it.

You said he has a tendency to overreact with anger so this probably won't be an isolated incident going forward. Whether he hits you or not is a different story but punching the wall is not good. See what his apology is and what he's willing to do to work on his anger. If nothing then suggest some counseling and if he doesn't like that then decide what to do. Usually these things get worse before they get better.
"Yep, if you want a monogamous relationship you should break up. Tinder is not for making friends!!

Or if you don't mind not being exclusive, you can use Tinder yourself and meet new friends. ""Male friends, you don't wanna put female, as you are afraid you will find lesbians"" haha.

"I think I would be annoyed if I were in the boyfriend's shoes. I totally understand why OP did what she did, and I think she did the right thing.

I don't have anything for you in the way of advice but maybe he is married and has an arrangement with his wife (or with himself) that he can have sex outside the marriage but only with sex workers?  It sounds insane but this whole story is kind of insane.

"I'll come at you from the other side.

When I met my boyfriend he was 4 months out from an end stage renal disease diagnosis. His kidneys were at 16% functioning. His blood pressure was at heart attack levels. He couldn't walk for more than 10 minutes, he was grumpy all the time because he was in so much pain.

Well we made it through. It was hard. And we didn't have sex for half a year because he quite literally could have died from it. We live with the fact that even after his transplant he'll be immuno compromised forever and that's if the transplant is successful. Now we live with dialysis, the fear of infection and the lingering effects of him having had no kidney function for 2 years before his diagnosis and 2 strokes after. He's 28 by the way.

I'm not saying I was always the most patient. But I was supportive, I was sympathetic and I was laid back enough to let his stress and anxiety roll off me without taking it personally.

What helped me was that he explained to me what he was going through every step of the way, through knowing I could understand and it made everything a lot less stressful for me and he was honest about his diagnosis when we met. I knew before our first date, so I knew what I was getting into.

You can find someone that can be with you without having a Florence Nightingale syndrome or a need to heal you, you'll find someone who'll take you the way you are, no pretentions, no strings. "
"In most states the termination of parental rights does NOT terminate the obligation to pay child support unless it is a termination of said rights is so another party can adopt the child. So unless the mother marries and the step parent wants to adopt their kid, then OP certainly will still be financially responsible for their child.

There is a difference between parental rights and parental duties. He certainly can give up his parental rights - to visitation, medical information, to have a say in choices that need to be made for the child, etc

"&gt; I know but bathing with him is just so fun and I don't want to let go of that

This quote is really what gets me. There's no actual reason for her to be bathing with him. It's not that she was assigned this chore by parents too lazy to do it themselves, she just wants to. It's not unusual for a 6-year-old to need some assistance with his bath but she can do that with her clothes on.

I really, truly hope you find a way to stand up for yourself, in more ways than just this one.

And they should have met at a neutral place. Dogs can get weird when you introduce them to another dogs home or when another dog is introduced into their home. I'm sorry for both the dogs.

Maybe one day you will have a kid who you want to throw up in the air or chase. Hell maybe you just want to be able to go up the stairs when your older without it being a mission.

Those will be (most likely) the two names that your son goes by and the general public/friends/co-workers know him as. *With that first and last name he's already going to be ""fitting in"" with your husband's family and your friends' kids.*

Tell your husband that your son should have a Hispanic name so your son fits in with *your* family. If your husband doesn't realize he's being a giant hypocrite at that moment, please try to get him to understand. It really sounds to me like your husband wants control over all 3 of your son's names and can't give in a little bit over the least consequential name.

Also I think your son will like having a name that is associated with both sides of his family. It's something that can be really special to him later on and he'll feel cooler than all those kids with ""William"" as their middle names."

"Apparently in name only. Listen, I’m genuinely sorry that you’ve lost your sister, but you need to focus your hurt somewhere else. As far as your sister you basically didn’t keep in touch for Reasons. Her mother doesn’t actually owe you anything, as shitty as that is for you to cope with.


Get therapy, write about how you feel, maybe write her mother something heartfelt (that is about the mothers loss and maybe apologising for not knowing and maybe asking if there is any chance you can visit and pay respects) but otherwise, do your own memorial. This one cannot be about you I’m afraid. Let step mum grieve. "
"If you are able to keep him make sure you get that microchipped changed to your info. 

Additionally since I'm already here, I agree with offering to ""adopt"" the cat by giving her money. She probabaly feels guilty for not actually taking care of him. And it shows because he doesn't even bond with her. I actually got an auto feeder and water for mine, but it's because I am sometimes out for dinner time but I always give him his wet food treat and we cuddle when I'm home. She's silly, cats need attention and love, and though they can be fickle and weird, they will show they care about someone. 

I'm glad you are trying to give him a better home. Good luck! Also pet tax? "
It wasn't your job to tell her. It's not your job to manage her feelings about the divorce. She's putting too much of this on you.

"You're not being tough you are being unhelpful. Despite how your parents have raised you what worked with you will not work with her. Or hell many people. Have you considered the fact your sister might have anxiety? I mean jesus christ step back for a moment and ask yourself how ANYTHING you've said to her is actually helpful. you haven't made suggestions, you've simply told her what to do, as if that is how life works.

It doesn't. 

&gt;I recognise that telling her she's overweight might be hurtful

There is no might to it. It IS. More so when you add in your tone deaf and one size fits all commentary of eat better and exercise more. 

&gt;she keeps telling me her school is really stressful and I have no idea how hard life is for her.

You don't and I bet you have never EVER genuinely asked her if she's alright/needs help without immediately hopping on the judgement. what you want for your sister and what will make her happy are not the same. 

&gt; I don't know if she's genuinely trying her hardest but I can't stand to watch her carry on the way she is.

because you haven't actually tried to know.

&gt; I want the best for her, but she's really hard to work with. 

Because you aren't trying to work with her, you are trying to direct/lead. Not the same thing.


EDIT:

Ask yourself the following

-What makes my sister happy? Note: not what you think, what you know.

-What are her hobbies?

-Is this major what she wants or what she picked to make our parents happy?

-When was the last time I listened and didn't just tal?"
"&gt;This also kinda implies that his wife (J’s granddaughter!) is somehow less family than the uncles. That stuck out to me too lol...

That's not too uncommon, depending on the culture. In many, it's common and even expected that a woman will give up her family name to honor her husband's family. Then, it doesn't make sense to consider female family members long-term perpetuators of your family line. It's kind of depressing how common it is, actually."
"I hate to say it, but this had to have been somewhat premeditated. While she was with you, she realized her ex was available again (or was won over by him, either way), and chose him over you. 100% ignore her, do not let her back into your life, don’t settle for someone who sees you as option 2 man- you can do infinitely better. I hope you feel better soon."
"Ok, well when you and her stop saying negative things about anyone you can get back on your high horse. Until then, we're all human, so set your expectations in the real world and not Disnyeworld. "
"Getting pregnant on birth control is not a super rare thing. There is literally no reason for you to automatically suspect she ""tricked"" him into a pregnancy (I have that in quotes because adults know how pregnancy works and that birth control isn't a 100% guaranty against it, so anytime a man ejaculates inside of a woman, bc or not, they should both realize that there is always a chance of pregnancy)."
"&gt; It's not your job to soothe your boyfriend's insecurities.   
   
And the more you let him lean on you for it, the more it becomes your job, and the worse this will get.  The more you let him talk to you about this kind of thing, the more he HEARS you talking about it, and the more he'll assign his insecurities to YOU and get even worse.  Like, because you dignified this question, he now knows you must have (at least in that moment) compared their looks.  Which proves he's right to be insecure.  Not in reality, but in insecurity-land.  The more you engage the worse it will get.  The more chances you have to slip up and say ""fine Danny is more attractive"" which he will then never get over.  Best thing you can do is refuse to talk about it."
As dude I don’t even want to be “approached” by someone.
"Ah ok, sorry for the false alarm on the throwaway.

Counseling could help get to the root of why he doubts you, but maybe there isn't a rational reason under there. I do think having a deadline is a good thing for you, but if you feel like you've been communicating clearly, there's not much more you can do."
"&gt;Learn the actual definition of racism, not the colloquial one

By actual do you mean prejudice plus power? Because that's not the actual definition, it's one definition used by a subset of academics. The colloquial definition of prejudice based on race/ethnicity is fine. 

They should definitely learn about institutionalised racism, and implicit bias though. "
"Honestly, this shows a massive power imbalance at least in his head and this that it gives him a right to talk to you like that. He sees his place as his place only and so he can do what he wants, including being loud etc. 

Have you ever responded with a ""yeah and?"" because I would. 
 "
"You don't need to make a big song-and-dance about ending things if you don't want. Hell, you can just text him and say ""I don't think we should see each other anymore"" then block him and never see him again. It's not like he's considerate of your feelings, so why should you be considerate of his?"
"It's...a pretty standard definition across the social sciences. Not sure if you just dislike it or what, but that's a bit wrong. It's definitely wrong for you to describe it as an esoteric definition and to describe it as such detracts from what's being discussed here.

OP's sister is actually experiencing this form of racism directly and her life is being influenced by it. She's learning how prejudice and power are directly intertwined and influence her life in a white family as a black woman. "

"Listen to her, be supportive, offer to meet her boyfriend or drive or where she needs to go. Be someone that she can trust.

You can't control her relationship with your parents, but try to strengthen what you have with her. She's getting good grades, and I don't see her falling off the deep end or joining the wrong crowd yet. But keep an eye on her

Find some good material to read on what's it like to be black in America, and then ask her about her own experience. Continue to listen and let her be heard. When her parents tell her that they don't see race, it's not making the other bullies disappear."
"&gt; and he said that it was to protect her feelings because she notoriously has issues with people who are in relationships, due to not being in one herself.

So...he has trouble saying ""no"" to her, but no problems saying ""no"" to you?

Oh, OP...

He may not be fucking her, or even interested in fucking her, *but he is very keenly interested in privileging her and her needs over you and yours.*

I suspect that she may start having little ""crises"" that necessitate cancelling dates or spending the evening texting her as you sit there and spin your wheels.

Do NOT be the ""chill girlfriend,"" OP.  Stop trying to finesse this.  And, no, do not go out with the two of them:  I promise you that she will spend her time hanging all over your bf, drawing him into conversation after conversation about the Good Old Days, full of in-jokes and references to people and places and events that you don't understand.  It will be an evening spent *establishing dominance,* and a little part of you will die.

Thought experiment:  if you asked him to choose, are you sure he'd choose you?  Your relationship sounds tentative, probably because he's not sure whether he wants to abandon a sure thing (you) on favor of striking up things with his ex. (Hint:  she's dropped veiled suggestions about this.)  (Also:  she will quite likely lose interest in him if he did dump you, because that was the goal, reaffirming her wow power.)

I would just walk away from this."

"&gt;His dad broke the law. You can't kick someone out like that legally. If brother has been living there, the brother has tenant rights and legally can't be forced to leave like that.

lol seriously? Everyone on this board always goes on about how you can't kick people out because of tenant rights and sometimes it's just so ridiculous. While in most cases it's ""technically"" true, it doesn't matter unless the person being evicted a) is aware of this specific tenant right, b) wants to try and sue over their eviction, and c) has the means (money, time, etc.) to pursue the case. It's something that can't hurt to keep in mind, but for the vast majority of situations that get posted here in which it's not a formal, contractual tenant-leaser arrangement, it's not gonna matter and is the equivalent of telling OP that speeding is illegal. Do you really think OP's brother is gonna sue his father? Do you think Random Unemployed Leech #1031 is gonna try and sue? Hell, I dunno if they even can sue if they willingly leave and it's not a ""formal"" eviction notice (though IANAL).  
(Note, I'm not advocating for people to illegally evict someone, just stating that in most cases here it's the equivalent of telling someone that drugs are illegal).

Also, coming from someone who has ADD, don't try and blame it on ADD, let alone *the possibility* that he has ADD. ""Pranks"" are stupid and childish, and if his mother really does have such an intense arachnophobia, then OP's brother should have known better, regardless of if he has ADD."

This is beyond the pale.  Your boyfriend is absolute scum. I actually gasped aloud when I read what he did.

"If you had to leash your dog in your apartment, it means you don’t have a crate. Get a crate. Regarding kids, you need to understand that even well trained dogs should not be left unsupervised with toddlers or babies. So although you and your boyfriend absolutely do need to train your dog, please be very aware that although training will help, and will improve your ability to manage a household with dogs and babies (once you have kids), you *will* *not* be able to just let your dog and baby hang out without close supervision. Which leads me back to getting a crate. 

So, yes, invest in some training courses. These courses will not ‘fix’ the dog. Training new behaviors requires time and effort and re-enforcement. Frankly, the dog appears to be exhibiting fairly normal dog behavior, esp for an untrained dog. But, training courses will teach you and your bf how to behave, and how to re-enforce lessons with your dog. You will need to do this consistently, and over a long period of time. It will be a lot of work. It will require discipline (on your part). It will require you to have patience with the dog. It will cost money. It will be an investment, and won’t solve your problems unless you are willing to put some work into it. 

And one final thing - I take exception to your comment about your bf’s dog being ‘basically a bad dog.’ He is untrained. He is not bad.

"&gt; It's been an uphill battle to get her more comfortable with herself, and it's 1 step forward, 2 steps back.

There are plenty of small, beautiful towns in the US that are much more racially diverse then BFE, Oklahoma.

You need to be honest with her and not hide your feelings."
"Hm that is a scary thought. I have told him clearly (in the beginning, after he messed up) that if he wanted to do sexual things with other girls he could leave because I would not put up with it.

How long has she begun being treated for anemia? When I was a little older than her (14) I was sad and tired all the time and was diagnosed with chronic anemia. The thing about it is that when you're so exhausted all the time I would find that I was at times painfully sad and worried about everything. When you're that exhausted your emotions are all over the place and don't make any sense. You're a wonderful brother who clearly cares so much about her. Hopefully she will feel much better once she has normal iron levels again but if not therapy would be a wonderful idea. Also make sure she's taking Vitamin C with her iron supplement to help her body absorb it. 
"""Older brother""??? 

I'm with the others who have suggested you're not the only one he's done this with.  Have you heard of Larry Nassar?  The doctor who's been in the news for sexually abusing female athletes at Michigan State?  This story sounds strangely familiar.  Find someone you trust and TELL them what's been happening NOW.  Eventually, this will all come out in the open.  Would you rather it came from your mouth or from someone else?

Even though you feel bad about this, it's not your fault.  He's manipulating you and been planning this from the beginning."

Sounds reasonable to me, speak to him about it when you are just at home and not travelling, then if he makes suggestions on the plane you can remind him of the conversation. 

If he's one of those people who always want to offer solutions and not just listen, maybe get him to dig out your nasal spray or painkillers so he'll actually be useful."
"&gt; I've mentioned he deserves better before and he is denying it 

If this is happening, you’re not doing it in private. 

There is no point to saying things like this beyond manipulation. If you sincerely believe this, then it should be pretty straightforward that you need to break up. If you *don’t* sincerely believe this, then saying it is just an attempt to solicit comfort and reassurances from your partner by sounding pitiful. 

Believe it or not, I’m really not trying to shit on you here. I recognize that you may have a personality disorder and those are difficult to control. But you’re an adult now, so it’s on you to do so - no partner of yours can ever be expected to do it for you, nor can they be expected to bear the outcomes of your worst impulses. You’ve got to learn to communicate without violence, and to apologize without histrionics. And most importantly, you’ve got to recognize when a relationship, of any kind, is more than you can handle. If you’re physically lashing out at a partner, you have absolutely reached that point. "
"So I think part of why he hasn’t stopped is that up until this point, there haven’t been any consequences. You ask him to stop, yes, but it doesn’t sound like that’s enough for him, and that’s a big problem to me. I also have a husband who likes to touch me, but I’ve never felt objectified by it, because every single time he touches me, he literally says, “Is this okay? I don’t want you to feel like I’m not paying attention.” And if I say, “Not right now, please,” he immediately apologizes and stops for the duration of the conversation. He does that because he respects me, and my bodily autonomy is reason enough for him. It doesn’t sound like your partner is showing you that same respect.

Now, like I said, you can make it clear to him that conversations and touching will not continue if he keeps doing this, but it won’t solve the problem that he doesn’t think you inherently deserve to be able to decide what happens to your body."

Tell him how you feel, the shit he does to you. You have a list, all you have to do is read it off. There is no *nice* way of doing this. He treated you terribly and he needs to hear it. He needs to realize that he was horrible to you (so he can try and work on this in the future. But not with you.) 

Tell him and then leave. Find someone who actually loves you. Find a relationship that isn't just ""good when it's good"" but that makes you happy instead of stressed. Find a relationship that is simply ""healthy and good"". "

You need to grow up and handle your own relationship. If you can't deal with your wife without running to both sets of parents, then you're really not in a position to be married. "
"It will be hard and close on the lawyer before she comes to get her things. So OP needs to look around tomorrow on Avvo or something and then Monday morning, get in someone's chair. "
"&gt; I wanted to marry and have kids with her, but one of her messages was about how she would never want to have kids with me because of my age and sperm quality. It was honestly pretty offensive. 

She's actually being smart - advanced paternal age is linked to birth defects."
"Do you two have a joint emergency fund?  Does he have an emergency fund?  Is he putting anything towards retirement or long-term savings?  

He's currently paying 850 a month plus 50% of groceries.  You're paying 800 a month plus 50% of groceries.  He makes 70% more money than you do.  It's understandable that you're resentful.  You're trying to be frugal and are feeling rather impoverished, and he's not just buying the occasional splurge, but making a ton of expensive purchases that only benefit him.  

I third/fourth/fifth going to see a financial planner stat.  "
"He wants to fuck you.

What he is doing here is testing your boundaries.  When you finally pushed back, he dredged up something called ""plausible deniability:""  he never actually asked you to go out with him or have sex with him, so he can always fall back on the Ol' Reliable, ""Oh, but I didn't mean it!""

&gt;  He said he'd help me to get over my ""shyness"" and social awkwardness.

A-OOOOO-GA!  A-OOOOO-GA!!!!

That is the sound of the Creep-o-Meter hitting overload.  He wants to ""help"" you by applying his helpenboner.  Look, you are a woman, and this means that you have been subjected to a lifetime of gaslighting about this behavior.  You've been told to disregard your gut, you've been told that men just don't know what they're doing, that they're just sweet bumbling bundles of cluelessness that have to be carefully and endlessly handled by the women around them so that they never experience Teh Bad Feels because if that happens...well, then they have bad feels and for some reason that can never EVER happen?

Listen to your gut.  You are underreacting.

Go to Captain Awkward and read letters 322 and 323.  Your prof isn't a full-on creeper so you'll be tempted to dismiss those cases as not relevant to you.  The point is that you need to recognize the patterns.  Every  woman caught up in this kind of drama feels isolated and alone.  Every woman instinctively feels guilt and responsibility.  Every woman believes that she has no right to speak out or defend herself *because she doesn't believe she deserves defense.*

And while you're there, trawl through the good Captain's archives.  I think you'll find a lot of eye-opening information about manipulative behavior.  And after that?  Read *Why Does He Do That?*  I want you to read this because you need to learn what the red flags look like.  You need a firmer grasp on what bad behavior looks like.  And after *that?*  *The Gift of Fear,* which is about trusting your gut.  (But tear out the chapters on abuse.  The author is, alas, a victim-blamer and so there is nothing there anyone  needs to read.)"
"Cosign this advice. I am sorry you are going through this

I emphasized it since it was buried 2/3 down in the relevant comment.

"I think we found OP’s brother.  

Edit:  I mean the person you are replying to."
So ignoring her and acting uncomfortable speaking to her and complaining publicly about having to work with her on a project is A-ok but her reacting to that by changing projects and not going to a bar with him is immature? 
Then explain to him that you enjoy your strictly professional relationship with him and respect his marriage. Ask him to set the boundaries of your friendship so that he is most comfortable. If rumors about your friendship continue go to HR and document everything. 
You're an adult and he puts you in the naughty corner? Heck no. End the relationship.
This is a pattern of abuse. You are in an abusive relationship. You know you need to leave
"&gt; she started accusing her of being a terrible friend because she never hung out with her and she was always hanging out with her coworkers after work instead.

Hanging out with other people doesn't make Abby a bad friend.

&gt; Abby is our only fully white friend in the group and Emily made frequent jokes about it despite nobody really laughing and it setting a weird mood. 

Emily shouldn't do that. That's racist.

&gt; She started by explaining that she mainly was upset that as a person of color I don’t speak out publicly on political issues that are relevant to POC even though people I know are being affected. 

You could speak up about her treatment of Abby. 

&gt; she said we didn’t have to volunteer because “all we need is a share or like”. 

Sharing or liking will make no difference in the world.

&gt; there hasn’t been contact since.

Good, then the problem is resolved.

"You know millions of people in relationships still watch porn, right?"
this is some damn good advice. 
Sounds like you aren't allergic to dogs.

I think it might be best to call off the wedding. Sorry.
Life and responsibilities get harder not easier.  I felt busy and overworked in college; it was actually a picnic compared to real life and real job/family responsibilities.  Red flag here if he can’t turn it around.
Thank you for the advice. I appreciate this :)
"I don't mean this to hurt you but your stepmom probably feels like her daughter's family shouldn't have needed her to get cancer to make her a priority.

It's very sad and I am sorry for you loss. I think it might help to see this from where your ex SM is coming from. She raised you for 10 years and you said she wasn't evil so it's not likely she turned into a monster.

How often did your father see his daughter? When was the last time he talked to her? Did he pay regular child support? "
"The fact she ""lost"" it tells me she either doesn't respect you.  either that or she isn't willing to or doesn't want to negotiate.  I""d back away without an agreement.

If you don't take charge early on she'll walk on you."

"&gt; I still have this instinct not to go out with him

Babe, go with your gut. You felt like you were one step away from being in danger this entire date, and from the sounds of it, so do I. 

This is a good lesson to learn at your age. We don't owe anyone second dates, we don't owe anyone an explanation, and we don't need to do anything that makes us uncomfortable. Block his number and forget about him."
"Talk to him, tell him he hurt your feelings. It's an immature joke, I wouldn't like it either. "
"Your parents sound psycho, and you sure as shit don’t stand up to them.  I wouldn’t want them around my child either. "
"Is it about the teeth or about the fact you perceive that your fiancée is trying to change you so you look like someone you are not? Do you think deep inside she wants to change you, and doesn't accept you just as you are?

If she is generally not a shallow person, if she has shown she is there for you and accepts everything about you but the teeth, maybe she just wants you to feel better about yourself (she has known you for 10 years, maybe she sees you feel more strongly about your teeth than what you are telling us)? You say you hide your smile on camera, maybe she wants you to look happy to marry her and not look like you are being forced to do it? And maybe she thinks you will feel better about yourself after you do such a small thing? 


Sometimes people wants us to change not because they don't love or accept us as we are, but because they feel that a little thing would make a big positive difference in your life. I totally get what you are coming from, believe me, but here you should reflect about what could be your fiancée's true motivation to ask for such a thing. You know her far better than we do, just think about it."
"Your boyfriend is 29 and knows what he's doing. 

I'm 22 and my boyfriend is 28. He makes nearly 4 times what I do ($20k vs 78k). He pays for a LOT of stuff for me, and at first I did feel a bit guilty. But he's responsible with his money and he likes doing it. 

My contributions to our relationship aren't financial. I cook, I clean, I iron his shirts and hang out his laundry. I cut his hair at home and hang out with his entire family for 10 hours at a time. So I'm making sacrifices of time and effort instead of cash. He can't drive so I do the driving and he buys the fuel. I suggest you look into your own relationship and see what YOU'RE contributing. I bet if your BF wants to give you all these things you must be worth a lot to him. 

Also you can just buy cheap presents. For V day my boyfriend received a homemade card, a chocolate egg, a lottery ticket and a blowjob. I got a trip for 2 to a day spa. I reckon both had equal thought into the present, one just cost more money. "
Okay well maybe it needs to be an argument. He needs to realize what he said was wrong. 
"It really isn't. Other people are telling you that this dynamic isn't healthy or normal. Maybe try to fix that, and you mind find that your other issues resolve themselves."
"So this is probably true, but that doesn't mean it's not emotionally wearing on OP and that she should have to just deal with the constant digs and cold-shoulders from these assholes.

Yes they are assholes but it still hurts.

OP, maybe Shabecca could be more of a one-on-one friend than a go-to-the-bar friend?  Girls night in with wine and take-out? Seeing a rom-com?  

Or if you have to just cut her out of your life because this is taking a toll on your emotional well-being, that is an okay thing to do.  You don't owe anyone your time or friendship."
"He's still dating her.  Maybe not as frequently, but they are definitely still dating.

"
I think that deep down this is what I'm most afraid of. We've been together almost a year and he might actually be a stranger
"Also please be prepared for him to be hot and cold on this issue. I wouldn't be surprised if in a week or two he is back to being supportive. I also wouldn't be surprised if that doesn't last very long. Please please continue to plan for the baby in a way that isn't dependent on him. I know it is so nice to think that his supportive moods will last, but don't count on them. "
You're still so young! Life's just beginning for you. 
"Idk....people are making it sound like she’s starving and barely making ends meet, but all it looks like is that she can’t buy luxuries for herself while he can, and she contributes a proportional amount to the mortgage, pays the cell phone, and half of groceries. My guess is he’s happily paying for everything else since he makes the higher salary. She just can’t buy fun things because she’s saving for school, so I don’t think the resent is justified, but maybe there’s other things I’m missing."
Things already have changed. Her need for sleep trumps his need to sleep in the same bed as his wife.
"Oh, he is... If the ""full package"" includes misogynistic beliefs and double standards!

Eww!"
"Uhh, no. If they were dating for a significant amount of time, then yeah she should be fully open with him about all her options. But when this offer came along they had JUSF started dating. He didn’t have to agree to be long distance. He’s acting like a child now. A boyfriend of a few weeks doesn’t get to decide a major life choice for her, fuck that noise. "
"I have noticed this misuse of the term also, and not just here. It seems people like saying it, but don't really know what it means."
Chameleon is the best out of all of them. I feel so bad for Guppy. Who calls their kid Guppy holy hell
"Also, a casual relationship breaking up because one member has some serious trauma makes sense. Still hurts a ton, but the amount of emotional labor it takes to support a partner through recovering from an abusive childhood is a big ask for a casual (apparently primarily sexual?) relationship.

With his current partner, however, OP has a year long commitment and a partner who is clearly invested in overcoming obstacles in the relationship. I bet that if OP explained his scars to his boyfriend it might actually make them a stronger couple. "
"Look, once you get in the habit of eating healthy, it's very easy to eat healthy. Tastes buds change. Many people like your bf don't choose to not eat sweets, they just don't taste good anymore. I think you're looking at this from the wrong perspective."
Sometimes people know they’ve gone too far so they try to poison the reputation of the other person.  He probably realized he’d fucked himself at the club and thought his only option was to get to management first to give his version.  Unfortunately there’s no way to put a positive spin on what people saw.
"I could maybe see where he was coming from if it was a container of rice you left in the fridge for a week and weren't going to eat it... this is just pure disrespect. Fuck that guy and the horse he rode in on. I'm going to second the suggestion of a fridge lockbox, because it's cheaper than getting a minifridge for yourself. "
"She might see it as worth it, she'll be saving lots of money by moving back in with her mum. But you're right, I do have all the documents in a safe place (hard copy in the safe, soft copies in my email and USB drive) so I think it's okay :S"
"I agree. It seems like a minor incident but it speaks loudly about his character. Honestly, this would be breakup worthy to me."
"What about the fact that being vengeful the way you did might make your girlfriend question if it would be safe to break up with you, lest you do something like that to her in retaliation?"
"But the ashes are gone, regardless of whatever ties may have existed between them and your mother’s spirit. Your boyfriend fucked up and now you’re in this conundrum because he’s a careless nitwit. There’s no option C where you can opt to get the ashes back as far as I can tell, so either you lie and let your father live in blissful ignorance, or you tell the truth and let him be devastated—either way, you guys have no ashes and no connection to your mother’s spirit through her remains if that’s how you see it."
"Would there be additional training, schooling etc.. that you could do on line if you waited it out. 

Are there volunteer opportunities that could plump up your resume in your chosen field if you decided to stay?"
"Did I get this right? Your ""friend"" told you to ""get with a real man"" after your partner came out as trans? how is he still in your life and what does a person have to do to get on your bad side? Sorry not trying to be an ass, you seem way too kind to some jabroni who does not deserve it at all."
"It takes about an hour and a half, the fact is it was time wasted, food watsed and in the end he didnt even ask if he could use her fucking container.

It was a shitbag move on this dude's part, and honestly I'd sit down and have a serious, calm talk about boundaries and if he still isnt willing to fix himself, fuck him. I'd start looking for a new roommate "
"I agree, and OP, they may not want you to stay a whole month if your bf is a danger as it's possible that would put their kids at risk. 

OP, they will likely be understandably a little disappointed at first but they will also understand that you're in a bad situation and need to get away. I'm sure they'll be sorry to see you go for their kid's sake but they will want you safe if they are decent people. You've got to put your health, safety and wellbeing ahead of the commitment to them. "
"The rest of my care whilst I was in there was absolutely spectacular, but they told me the whole time I was in all of my prenatal classes that active labour is the best. Move around, change positions, don't lie on your back and then as soon as I went into labour all they did was lie me on my back and tell me to stay there. No wonder my labour was about 23 hours long he would have come out a lot quicker if they'd let me move. To all those who want to move in their Labour and are under the NHS put your foot down, I wish I had with mine as it was the worst experience of my life. "
"Absolutely. I was wide awake and just using one in the living room and it started sparking and flaming, which is everything I'd been warned about from my childhood, decades ago. This happened only a couple years ago. Thankfully when I unplugged it stopped but I was ready to get the fire extinguisher!

Edit: it was a few feet from anything, on hardwood floor and the parts sparking were in the top half where the heater was. It was only a couple years old with all the safety bits, like if you tipped it over it would shut off. It was literally what I'd heard could happen and never believed, but I was paranoid enough and hand enough blankets that I wouldn't run one even if I didn't have power while I was asleep. So glad, even fully awake it was pretty scary.
"
"Breaking up is scary, a lot of unhappy relationships are driven by momentum and fear of being alone. He might be hoping you'll do it so he won't be the bad guy. It your needs aren't being met and he doesn't want to change, you should leave. "
"Depends on the state though so be careful. If the kids have been around the grandparents for a certain amount of time in their life, regardless of parenting status, they may actually be entitled to visitation rights. "
"I don't think you're overreacting. You weren't asking for comments on which swimsuit you should buy and you have every right to feel insulted that they gave you unsolicited advice that they dont feel you look good enough to wear a 2 piece bikini. 

But if there's one thing I learned as a teenager it's that girls often make these comments about others because they are insecure in themselves. No matter how beautiful a teenage girl may be, they will often think they have numerous flaws. 

Whatever their reason, try not to take it on board.
They are not the authority on your body. You are.  "
"No offense dude, but I would make sure that kid is yours before you start assuming daddy duties. Your girlfriend is obviously very unstable, and is continuously in close proximity to other patients in the hospital for frequent amounts of time, with you unable to even communicate with her directly, so by that alone, I would do a paternity test.  "
"I'm the same way as your husband - skiing with friends is fun, but inevitably leads to getting frustrated waiting at the bottom all the time because I'd rather be bombing trees and moguls than chilling on the green slopes with them. Maybe a beach vacation would be better next time! "
Please don’t wait around to find out what else he wants to destroy :(
Husband tried to compare it to college and that's where I thought it was way different. And went to the creep-level. We're grown ups now and pornography is even more available then ever.
"I find his behavior frightening in the respect that it seems very much like something an abuser would do. Turning it around on her is edging on gaslighting. His behavior overall is definitely a giant red flag for potential physical abuse, and it is already raging emotional abuse. 

I would run fast. This behavior is not okay and is not normal. People are allowed to have memories of good times with other people. This is only the tip of the iceberg as to what is to come in the future."

"Your boyfriend is a wastoid piece of shit.  Throw him the fuck out and slam the door behind him.

He pinches the dog and flicks his nose? Abusive piece of shit. He yelled at the dog until the dog peed in fear? Abusive piece of shit.

Open your fucking eyes, girl."
"I dont know if I'm sad or glad I'm not the only one who thought of this. Whatever it is she needs to see someone. It could be clinical depression, weird teen sadness, or something like molestation happened and she's keeping it in. "
"Agreed. Once puberty kicked in, I also went through my first major depressive episode. The hormone changes, the change from elementary to middle school and all that came with it, etc, just exacerbated it."
"When I take a vacation with my girlfriend, I miss a week of work. I have to spend the month before the vacation getting ahead, tying up loose ends, and preparing for my absence. I have to spend the month after making up for all the shit I wasn't able to do while I was on vacation. While on vacation, I'm in a strange bed, strange shower, strange gym, rental car, unfamiliar roads, unusual schedule, unusual diet. I enjoy the time with her, but it's also a source of stress.

Not everybody is way into traveling and vacations. Especially really busy people. It is completely reasonable for your boyfriend to be stressed instead of kissing your ass about how grateful he is that you bought him a vacation. He'll enjoy the trip, as will you, but he's entitled to feel how he feels instead of feeling the way you think he's supposed to feel."
"&gt; Some people live out their 20’s in a hippy communes doing LSD or traveling the country with a duffle bag. Those people don’t keep doing those things once they’ve settled and decide to reproduce

Personally, I wouldn't marry someone and have kids with them without an agreement that the behavior would change! It just sounds like the OP assumed her husband would give up his hobbies after becoming a father - did she ever actually ask if he was planning to? "
"&gt; he’d only marry me if I got plastic surgery

lol - holy shit.  Dodged that bullet pretty nicely!  "
"He should get the life insurance regardless as long as he's doing this. And HE pays for it, not from your joint money."
"100% your fault, and to be honest, you deserved to have the ring thrown back at you.

&gt; I have accepted and happily gave up things I can longer do like threesomes

Except you have **never ever said to this to her.  You just expect her to read your mind despite everything you have actually said to her being the opposite to what you claim**.

Notice you never mention any FMM threesomes.  How would you like it if she told you that was her dream?"
"She doesn’t want you to go away, and she most likely doesn’t want your brother to go away either. She’s tired of the impact the situation is having on her emotionally.  Although she loves her family, It’s still mentally draining, having to go on with your life but care for a sick child too. She’s probably finding it all too much. That being said, she should talk about her feelings like an adult instead of making passive aggressive comments. 

Ask her if she needs to talk, maybe bring up the idea of a therapist if she doesn’t already have one. 

I’d take the job, you can’t put your life on hold for other people. But I’d try getting help for my mother to get into a better place mentally, first. "
"Yep.  I'm an adult lady with luxuriously feminine, long pastel pink hair.  I also spend a pretty penny at the salon every month maintaining it.  I am also a gainfully employed non-junkie.  

Where did I go wrong??!!!!1"
"There's never going to be a time when she's not going through some kind of stress, especially the mundane moving-house and fight-with-friends kind.  But let's say that some magical time comes when everything clears up in her life and everything is going great and her life is perfect.  You won't feel guilty breaking up with her then, as well?  You won't feel like you're ruining her first good stretch in forever?

Just rip off the bandaid.  There will never be a perfect time to do it, so you have to just do it."
"wtf-he f*g LIED to her about the debt and has been ignoring her for a year and when she asks for more intimacy/closeness tells her her feelings arent justified.

They havent been in an up time for at least a year."
"Wow. Honestly I'd just leave. You're young and he has a family with this woman. Even if this woman and him were to break up, he's still the father of her child so they will forever be in each other's lives. 

That's an awful lie and for almost a year too. Thank goodness you found out now and not years from now when you were even more attached. "
"Your mom sounds like a piece of shit. I would never deal with that shit. It's your fucking decision and there's nothing wrong with leaving the past in the past as long as it works both ways.

And if you do say something to him just tell him you dated an older guy that got you in a lot of trouble with everybody.

I cant beleive your mom. God damn."
"Choice means choosing to have sex when you want to have sex and not a moment sooner.

It will put you in a niche no doubt about it but look at how much time and money you'd be saving from dates that'll go nowhere. 

That said, be upfront about what your beliefs are and EDUCATE yourself about sex, consent, contraception, male and female sexual health, what healthy sexual dynamics and expectations look like, what does female pleasure look like and how to communicate effectively about sex. Remember that sex is not a dirty thing, especially within a marriage and your wife is a person with wants and needs around intimacy and romance too.

Abstinence is not a good excuse for ignorance. Don't find yourself with the right woman and then spend 10 years make the mistakes that some who has been sexually active from a teenage years would make and have over a decade learning from.

Also look for realistic porn as opposed to manufactured porn so your expectations aren't skewed or downright wrong. 

The actual act itself will be awkward for the first time even with experienced folks but ignorance and awkwardness that could be excused in an 18 year old won't be with someone who is nearly 30."
"That makes complete sense. Regardless of who is ""right"" this is how he feels and we can't have a healthy relationship when he feels this way about me. "
"I work at a group home for people with profound mental disabilities and I can tell you, that if you do your research your brother could have a very fulfilling group home life. Our residents have jobs and daily programs, go on outings every afternoon when the weather is good or have game afternoons. They eat better than us, have constant medical help and supervision. The nurses work 24/7. And most importantly, they are happy. I think your mom could benefit from something like this; it is not easy to take care of people with mental disabilities. 
Aside from that, your brother is not your responsibility, it is your parents. However, that doesn't mean you should not be part of his life and be involved. I would say before you leave, talk to your parents with a cup of tea and a lot a of love. If they understand that he's not being dropped off and forgotten, they may be more inclined to find him a group home and you would feel less guilty about leaving your mom. "
"She retired early to go take care of her parents. Her parents are very old and very ill and they begged her to come help. Apparently the situation with her daughter is bad enough that they’ve accepted they could lose their help, though. 

And that is absolutely her plan with her daughter, she has told me and my SO multiple times that she expects us to take care of his sister, though I am 1000% against it. My SO knows this but we’ve always stayed quiet about it toward her to just avoid the argument "
"&gt; She is a hardcore feminist 

Nah, she’s a judgemental and controlling. She’s definitely not a feminist.

Good for you."
"&gt;But I am very uncomfortable with the idea of him being interested in men.

Seems like the bigger issue is his unwillingness to divulge this info to you.

But then again, he is pretty openly subscribed on reddit knowing you mess around on his computer. He could work way harder to hide it. Maybe he is hoping you find out?

All relationships are based on honesty. You're afraid because you dont understand why this is happening...but there is probably a perfectly rational explanation, if you actually talk to him about it.

Not gonna be an easy talk, but it needs to happen if you really want to stay with him."
Maybe if her dog barking is a nuisance she could do what any sane dog owner does and bring it inside.
"I dunno, I think it's a fairly fine line to walk since at the end of the day, what other people wear and like is well beyond ""nobody else's business"". I find that something like this is a case of ""I wouldn't be caught dead in those clothes myself, but if they like it..."" And then just find a way to accept that it's beyond your control and say. I'd be mightily offended if a friend expected me to change something so stupid for their comfort, anyway, cause my clothes isn't about them at all.

That being said, if my partner suddenly switched to a niche style like this, I'd probably sit him down and say it wasn't doing anything for me and could he possibly scale it back a little bit (and could we at the very least find clothes he likes that also flatters him?). If, however, it was a friend, then meh. As long as they stayed good people, it'd be irrelevant. "
"My ex were together for 6 years. He loved me more than I loved him. I tried and I tired but I couldn't make myself feels something I just didn't. He tried so hard to make me as happy as he was in our relationship, which was impossible because only one of us was madly in love and it wasn't me. I started to resent him and his efforts to make me happy. I felt hostage to his emotions. I wasn't happy enough and that made him sad. I tried breaking up with him, but he would freak out and I didn't want to hurt him. He would talk about our future together and I just didn't feel it like he did. The breakup was terrible and I still feel a lot of guilt.

My advice is break up now. It's only been 8 months. This doesn't get better with time. It only gets worse."
"&gt; Who are you to tell me what I'm not ready for? 

Well, he's your parent, so yeah he can tell you that. 

I get that it sucks, I really do, but being taught to drive is not a god-given right. Feeling angry and entitled about it is not going to help your cause. Maybe he's worried about letting you out into the big scary world with all the range of motion driving provides. You think being bullied has nothing to do with it, but as a parent, it's normal to feel protective and worried, and perhaps connect that bullying episode to ""what if he gets involved in bad situations and can't say no"". 

I'd try to approach him with courtesy and compassion and try again. And driving might seem easy, but it is a huge responsibility. You have people's lives in your hands. So yeah, a 16-year-old who talks like ""who is my father to embarrass me by denying me the right to drive"" might not be ready for it."
Anyone who is willing to call their SO a fat pig and say things to purposefully hurt you needs to be dropped like a sack of hot rocks.
"If you never find the ashes, would it be possible to take a few of your favorite things that remind you of your mother and place them inside the urn to create a special place to remember her?

This does not help you with your current situation which is truly heart breaking, but may be something to help going onward."
"In my opinion, taking his child to a prostitute to have sex with is not a good mark of a father. "
"She is looking at your family in the long term sense. Would you want to subject yourself to this for the rest of your life? Having to defend yourself, your race? get told to go back to Africa. Be treated with such disrespect. Every holiday? Every Birthday? Reunion? Every Funeral and every wedding? 

You need to deice what is more important, draw boundaries and stick to them. Even it means never seeing your shit uncles again. Or even your Mom and sister since they are such vocal apologists. "
"The point is that it matters to her, and she does most of the laundry.

When you’re in a relationship you try to do things to make the other person happy, not deliberately do things to upset the other person.

The fact you call this ‘rolling over’ is so bizarre. "
"The more I read about her the more I want to urge you to rethink continuing this relationship at all. She doesn't seem to understand that people are different from her she doesn't seem to respect you, help take care of you or actually love you as you are.

"Tacky, uncomfortable polyester sex costumes and lingerie aren't a gift for OP. They're a gift for OP's boyfriend. He does want her to perform for him. Or maybe he thinks it will be good for ""them"". But as a woman who was gifted equally gross outfits by an equally clueless boyfriend, it's an awful feeling."
You have a daughter. Your husband hired someone's daughter for sex...someone who we have no idea was willingly participating. Is he planning on hiring a man to deflower your daughter? Would be be OK with your daughter working in that place...or knowing that's where he took her brother?
Drive directly past this circus. Don't even bother waving as you go past it.

Specifically start refunding him 50% of what he lost

"&gt; Or would you rather break up to stop wasting each other time?

You worded this incorrectly. Break up and stop wasting HER TIME. You cheated and it's likely you'll do it again based on what you wrote. Leave her and give her a chance to be happy with someone that respects her. "
Because he's a creep and he's hoping you'll let him fuck you again.
"You didn’t read the post. He is doing it intentionally, refuses to stop, and tells OP she’s the one in the wrong."
I had a girlfriend just like this. Had. She somehow believed I should be honored that I got to see the real her. Cut your self free now.
"Sure, his in-laws are jerks. You won't get any argument from me, there.

But if I'm right, it seems your main issue is with your husband for giving in to them. This is a really common thing. Couples (especially married couples) are supposed to be a team, supposed to tackle all obstacles together, and are supposed to have an impenetrable bubble around them (and only them) that no one else may enter, not even his mother.

This can be a difficult adjustment for a lot of people. MILs often have a *very* difficult time adjusting to not being the caregiver, and not always being the voice that gets listened to. And their children (your spouse) have a difficult time learning how to say no to their parents, and work with their spouse. Doubly so when there is any sort of conflict. Your husband feels like he's stuck between you and his parents, you feel like you're being pushed to the outside, and his mother feels like the world is going to end because her baby boy doesn't want to tell her about every little boo-boo he gets. From your husband's point of view, he's trying to appease everyone (and as a result, he isn't appeasing anyone). You are in a position where you have to ""compete"" for your husband. Your MIL is responding by hanging on even tighter (ridiculously so). Pretty standard, unfortunately.

So what do you do about it? The bond you can influence is the one between you and your husband. That's the one that matters. The two of you will have some work to do, but it's *so* worth it. You need to establish boundaries on what that ""bubble"" means; I'd suggest that the two of you agree, explicitly, to solve all major problems, to wage all wars, together, and not let anyone (especially his mother) to meddle in your affairs. It's fine if he wants to talk to her all the time and respond to her crazy texts (although, for everyone's sake it'd probably be a good idea to back off a bit...), as long as he isn't letting his mother interfere in your relationship or problems that you're solving together. If she attempts to, it's up to *him* to shut her down or at least go ""yeah, uh huh, mom"" and subsequently ignore her. If the mother says something and he thinks it's a good idea, he can bring it to your attention and you can decide together.

Finally, for your own peace of mind, once you set up those basic ground rules, I'd suggest taking a more hands-off approach with your in-laws. I have an in-law that is a milder version of what you've described. If she calls and my wife wants to talk to her, it's to the point where she looks at the caller-ID and says, ""it's my Mom. You might want to put on your headphones,"" and I do. I trust my wife to tell me the important bits later, and wow, is that ever a lot less stressful."
Yes. And the last five years saw some incredible gains in the market. Losing that is huge. 
Yeah he is the person who let me know she was misinterpreting the situation and complaining about me. We discussed it and he says she has always had this side to her but it currently much worse. He sees it as she is a victim of being emotional who needs support and understanding. He and his brother put up with it and basically humour her. He thinks I shouldn’t rock the boat and it doesn’t matter as we don’t see her much. But it’s making me miserable. 
"You say no and ask them to plan some time for him to pack his own bags. ""WERE GOING ON A BADASS TRIP, GO PACK YOUR BAG. WERE LEAVING IN 30MIN!"" is just as exciting as leaving just that moment. Although that's maybe a thought for next time since you already agreed to this time. "
"&gt; Anytime we were about to sign a vendor, he would run it by all of us, list the money we would each owe, and then the ""total"" we owed based on other vendors we were responsible for. He was pretty on top of it and even had a google spreadsheet he shared with us that broke it down.

She says it right there. The parents knew the prices, agreed to all of them, had a running tally of their total owed."
"Tell them that you are considering just selling the house, buying a smaller one outright for you and your parents, and he can have any money that is left over. Considering california prices (oh god, the pain is real) he'll probably end up with nothing. Or he can take the thirty grand outright and be grateful that not only did he benefit from your hard work for all those years, he's getting a very generous amount of money for free, and on top of that, he still isn't the one who will be supporting your aging parents. 

If your parents argue, you can tell them that they are more than welcome to move in with your brother and his wife. But either way, brother and his wife need to find their own place now."
Yeah and the instructor also said he was in the wrong and behaved like a dickhead so....

"I hope this sparked some serious self reflection about you as a person and your values/morals. 

You know this guy is a predator, but you’ve befriended him and brought others around him. Giving a ‘heads up’ about predatory behaviour still indicates to everyone around you that you, on some level, accept and approve of him. 

I mean, that’s why you’re still friends with him right? Because being friends with him and maintaining your own comfort, outweighs the dangers and risks he presents  to your friends. 

Just because your boyfriend approves of his scummy behaviour doesn’t mean you should too. 

My advice is to use this experience as a chance to really self-evaluate. And stand up for what’s right. Good luck, it doesn’t sound like what’s right will be the easiest decision for you. "
"All I could think reading about what happened with Laura was ""holy crap, this woman is so lucky she wasn't raped"". This man is not your friend. And I would very seriously take a look at your boyfriend, he hangs out with this guy and says things like ""maybe she wanted it"". You need to sit yourself down and see if he aligns his views with James, even on small stuff, because as of right now I believe you're putting your female friends in absolute danger and if you weren't with your boyfriend you would be in immediate danger yourself, maybe you still even are. James has got to go, one way or the other. "
"It's a fair question. Why do you hate her?

Seriously: Why ARE you being so rude and dismissive to her, shutting her down with minimal answers, when she is just trying to engage in conversation?   Sure, she may not be able to help practically  - and I'm sure that frustrates HER too. 

Your fucking MAID gets more politeness from you.

How to handle? You go and fucking apologise for being so rude, and thank her for taking an interest."
Was going to say the same! So refreshing to hear someone that sounds so nice in here
"you have 2 kids and one on the way, he does not understand the aspect of being a SAHM of 2 small children under 5 let alone while pregnant. I would point out to him that you do clean and take care of the kids among other things during the day, and you do not get ""off"" at 5 pm as he does, if he wants the house cleaner he can pick up some of the slack when he gets home. This just makes me so angry reading this. you should not be expected to work a 15 hour day when he is only working an 8. "

"Is the car on property owned or leased by you?  Or is it parked on the road?

If it's on property you own, you'd probably need to give her the notice for abandoned property for your area.

If it's on property you lease, you could contact your landlord and tell them the car was left by an Ex and let the landlord deal with it.

If the car is parked on the road, you could call the police on the non-emergency line and report it as a car that has been parked there for X days.

"Unless you are abusing him or manipulating him in some way (I am assuming you are not), you deserve to have your partner know where he stands with you.  I would probably do the same thing you’re doing, especially if the relationship is otherwise great. But don’t discount yourself and what you want too!  I don’t believe in “the One” and I am willing to bet there are other people who you’d be amazing with who are also looking at a similar timeline as yours. You absolutely deserve to realize your hopes and dreams of marriage and starting a family. "
"Here's another idea. Try to think of women as ""people."" As in, are you trying to connect with someone on a human level?

"OP should ask the least musically inclined uncle if he wants to ""temporarily"" keep it. A temporary period that lasts until after J has passed away and all of the uncles are conveniently older and engrossed in their own families and grandchildren and never actually visit OP's home anymore. (I mean, really, how often do you actually see your aunts and uncles once you get older and start having a family of your own?)"
"Just....don't try to fuck him? Remember that he sees a hundred girls like you a day and has to be friendly and flirty with all of them because it's his job? I guarantee he is NOT interested, and would probably not be happy to be propositioned. 

It should not be this difficult to cross ""married"" out of your personal romantic potential list, and if it is, you need to find a new gym."
"I beg to differ to a degree. They still share 50-50 custody of a minor child (16 M). Though he's obviously not a little kid anymore, it's still a shared responsibility of theirs. Once 18 comes around though I think your point becomes a lot more relevant."
"Youre very rude in insulting him through this conversation. He didnt just outright buy it, he brought it up to you so you two could discuss it with the possibility he buys that one or a different one. Instead of discussing it with him, you kept insulting him and were kind of passive aggressive. You say you dont mind that he masturbates and find it normal, but youre getting very upset about him masturbating with some plastic.

First off, apologize for your rude behavior. Second, offer a compromise. If your main insecurity about it is that it looks realistic (lol@""realistic"" vibrating butt), ask him to look into a sex toy that doesnt look real. There are several that are like holes in a silicone tube with ribbed insides. The outside doesnt look 'real' but the inside feels 'real'. 

Sex toys like these (and in general) can be very helpful to masturbate with as they take out any possible hand caused problems with the penis (example: death grip, decreased sensitivity, etc). It is very likely that compromising with him and allowing him to get a (nonrealistic?) sex toy will improve your sex life when you are back together. "
"Okay dude, I am feeling bad for you. 

Most girls are not into older guys for maturity -- they either have daddy issues or want your money. That is not wrong. She's not a bad person, and she's just trading her youth and beauty for money.

You cannot shame her for that, as you were probably interested in her (be honest) for more than her intelligence and humor. 

It sounds like you don't want this trade-off. Well, date women in your league, and you'll find less gold-diggers. If you don't mind the tradeoff, continue dating with her.

She's honest, you are not."
"That you know of. It’s easy to hide a phone in 2018, especially from a dinosaur."
I can see why your mom is uncomfortable. 2 years ago her friend could’ve been arrested for this. You need to understand and accept *why* people find this disturbing and respect their boundaries. 
So? You're not her dad and she doesn't need your permission.
"Yea, I didn’t need to read any more after that, but I did anyway - shock of shocks, her husband is a colossal piece of shit. Good luck with that OP. At least you don’t have kids.

Edit - oh shit OP you and the kids have to get out."
Is there anyone over that particular mentor? Because no one should be coddling the creepy guy.
"I would suggest separating finances, moving out, and THEN deciding if you want to continue dating. Let him do any legwork to see you once you move out. 

Separating finances and moving out will communicate how serious you are about the need for real commitment vs promises for future commitment. If you are single at age 30, you can go with donor sperm."
I am suggesting OP meet her sister where the sister is: beginning to learn about these academic approaches to race in America.
You shouldn't be moving to a more expensive place that you cannot afford. He'll keep holding it over your head. You two really shouldn't be living together as there are some underlying issues of money and respect.

"I don't think the word ""love"" alone is going to make him think you're actually in love with him.  Was the rest of the note normal?

"But like I said. She can be angry. But it doesn’t give her the right to blow up. Full stop. 
People who explode like that are typically not the same people who calmly explain their grievances as they happen. If this was the straw it’s probably because she’s been bottling shit up. But still that’s not anyone else problem. "
I completely understand. And you’re right- it would be very unfair to ever expect him to change his mind someday. 
"Here's your explanation: He's a passive aggressive asshole. 

&gt;Is he done or is this him torturing me as he can see how upset I am?

Is he done? Is HE done?!?!

"
"Okay, based on that, I definitely think most of the blame lies with her then. So you have to ask yourself, is she receptive to (calm, kind) feedback and willing to change? Or is it impossible to have the kind of open communication you want with her? 

  

 

I'm not encouraging you to break up with her immediately, but I would wait a couple days and then try to have a serious conversation about this. ""GF, I don't know if you've noticed this, but it sometimes feels like you expect me to read your mind or even that you tell me the opposite of what you really want. For example, on Valentine's, I suggested going to Outback and several other restaurants and you said no, but later you said you were disappointed not to go to a restaurant. You might not have meant to do this, but it felt like you were asking me to read your mind and I couldn't win. I still don't understand how you wanted that night to go, or why you said no to every restaurant I suggested. In the future, I'd really like it if you could be more open with me about what you want and what you're thinking, so that we can work together and avoid misunderstandings like this.""

 

 
If she's able to have a conversation about why she handled things the way she did, and agree to try not to do it again, then you guys might have a future. If she just doubles down on blaming you, then that's a bad sign that if you stay, the rest of your relationship will be just like this."
"You should do the same thing you would do for a friend. I've stood up many times for my friends. Standing up for someone doesn't mean you have to start a physical fight. 

And again..you are okay with showing violence towards your girlfriend but not against someone who humiliates her. You need to look deep down inside whether you do really love her as a person.

"OK, with that context, I think that SHE is the one being abusive.  She yells at you, that's abuse.  She calls you abusive over minor things, that's abuse.  She spends your money without thought and blames you for trying to be frugal when YOU are footing all the bills (that's not abuse but it is very shitty).  

Honestly, what are you getting out of this relationship now?  Has she always treated you this way?  Did you live together before marriage?"

"I guess telling her that she was going to pay for all of day care if she wanted to have a job isn't something you see as coercive?

She felt humiliated asking for money for their son, and when trying to fix it by having her own money he decided to punish her by forcing the entire expense of day care onto her. This absolutely fits into the abusive category. 

Also her complaint isn't simply that he spends his money the way he wants, it's that what he wants to spend his money on is his own self rather than on their marriage. "

Trust me when I say the difference between having no nonwhite people and 83% white people is enormous. That 17% of non white people means they see and encounter non white people every single day.

It's not always that simple. Hormonal birth control may have very unpleasant side effects and an IUD may have it's own unpleasant and painful effects for her. It may also be a breeze for her, but it's up to her to decide what she wants to do with her body.

Have a mature conversation with your wife. Discuss options, preferences, wants, etc. and you may find an overlap of your timelines that you are both comfortable with. It may take some time to get pregnant, though. Needing 6 to 12 months is not unusual. "

I'll be honest with you: sudden increase in religiosity at around 30 is a bad, bad sign. It's a sign that he's about to turn into someone you won't like to be around. Indeed, it has begun. 

And don't think marriage will fix it: now he has started to get ""sex=sin"" in his head, even marital sex will feel sinful (yes, it's illogical, yes it has no scriptural authority, but he's not being *rational* here) and you are in for a life of him performing a bare minimum of unfulfilling duty sex.

"Well it’s a red flag if she won’t marry you without it. 

She needs to understand your financial means and if she really wants that ring she should help pay for it. The whole idea of diamond engagement rings exploded after an ad campaign in the late 30s. It’s not part of any meaningful tradition until marketing made it so. 

She needs to respect what you can spend on a ring and be happy that you love her so much you want to spend your life with her. She should also keep in mind that “upgrades” later on in marriages are popular. You can start with a beautiful ring that fits your financial needs NOW and then after 10 years or whatever time frame you can see if that same ring will fit your need THEN. 

We’re talking about a lifelong commitment to the person you love. The size of a material item should never prevent you from getting married. Would she rather have you and a smaller ring or not have you at all? "

"Mate you are just stealing time from her if you can’t bring something substantial to the table.

Not wanting a family when she does is a huge thing that divides any relationship, unless you can change your priorities to match hers you are just preventing her from finding someone who can help her achieve the future she desires.

If you want this to work you need to bring something new to the adventure and see if she wants to explore that with you.

OP isn't against him skiing in general. Finding out he was off skiing in the back hills is what was problematic to her.

Participating in extreme sports, off route and without the right safety gear is **dangerous as fuck.** If it wasn't dangerous, he wouldn't be doing it.

Ultimately she chose poorly for a husband. This guy will likely wind up divorced a couple of more times as his wives eventually get put off by his incessant risk taking. That's if he doesn't wind up with a serious injury along the way! None of us are immortal. If he really needs to be close to death to feel alive, eventually his luck will run out. Death may be an easier fate to him than waking up an quadriplegic and thus unable to do his beloved extreme sports anymore.."

Let me tell you.

It is a VERY BIG DEAL.

Emotional abuse like this stays with kids for a lifetime. I know, I suffered some myself and it wasn't half as bad as your son's by the sound of things. 

Get all the evidence you can (texts and whatnot, anything) and get yourself a lawyer, STAT. Your son is depending on you. "
"I meeeeeean, I feel like what you’re feeling is inappropriate guilt, and the solution to that is to feel the guilty feeling and not run away from it so you can learn that it’s not dangerous, it just feels icky. You’re already doing lots of things, so it’s more a matter of thinking, “Yup, I have this feeling. Good thing feelings aren’t facts!” and continuing to do what you were doing. Leaving the area because you feel guilty actually reinforces the anxiety.

OP’s spouse, on the other hand, is feeling the kind of bad feeling that’s designed to tell you when your behavior is shitty, which his is. I also got the impression that OP cleans when the spouse isn’t even *home* to feel guilty about not helping, and he’s just nitpicking about her “not spending enough time with the kids” after the fact. Super different, IMO."
"&gt; forcing a partner to suffer financially as a sign of love

If you google ""cost of engagement ring vs length of marriage"" you'll find a bunch of articles about one academic study that found

""Women who received expensive engagement rings also experienced higher rates of divorce. The study, by two economics professors at Emory University, found a similar correlation between less-expensive engagement rings and lower divorce rates. Women whose weddings cost $20,000 or more were 3.5 times more likely to end up divorced than women who spent $5,000 to $10,000. (According to The Knot, the average cost of a wedding in the U.S. is $30,000)""

The authors didn't posit a reason *why* the more expensive weddings tended towards divorce, but I would bet it has something to do with people valuing money/appearance/status over the compatibility and the longterm work it takes to maintain a happy relationship"
"I think that friend needs to grow up a little bit before he is ready to face the real world.  He’s clearly uncomfortable with the idea that humans are mammals.  

I know that “lactivism” has a bad name, but seriously - you have the right to breastfeed your baby.  Your baby’s hunger trumps whatever “offense” anyone might take.  Tell your friend he can come over again once the baby is weaned.  

By the way, please don’t let this reaction scare you away from breastfeeding in public.  Most people are not going to care, and you need to get outside and do things outside the house every so often.  Just remember that legally speaking, a woman is allowed to breastfeed anywhere where she is legally allowed to be.  "
"To me, it seems like you view getting the procedure as succumbing to vanity. It also seems you feel a bit hurt that Lucy doesn't accept this part of you. 

It's great that you accept this imperfection--body confidence is really important, after all!--but I wouldn't view this procedure as a vain fix to please your fiance. After all, it's affecting how you're posing in photos, yeah? Maybe consider reframing it as an investment in authenticity--you could give genuine smiles in pictures again following this procedure. "

"Twice divorced, cheated 30+ times, didn't love either wife, doesn't seem to love his three children, doesn't seem to love anybody except maybe himself, and has had a lot of random hookups.  

I really hope he keeps a handful of condoms on him at all times, but he probably doesn't since he has those three kids that he doesn't seem to care about very much.

Yes, you dodged a bullet.  

He wanted you to be #81 on his scorecard, so he did and said what he thought would attract you.  When you made it clear you weren't into just being his next random hookup, he backed up.  

However, the fact that he is still telling you how amazing you are and apologizing means he hasn't lost all hope that you'll have sex with him.  He's just switched tactics.  He knows you are attracted to him.

Please don't fall for it.  He will either drop you instantly afterwards, or do the slow fade.  And you will *really* feel bad then, because you *will* have been played.

Shut the door on this guy.

"No, not suddenly and I wouldn't call it drastic for a 40-year-old woman with four children to get a more permanent form of birth control.

"Yeah, that's the whole problem if you can't stop from crying at sensitive moments: you either can't stop yourself or the methods you can use both don't stop you entirely from getting teary-eyed and also make you look like a mad person.

Your parents are the landlords let them step in. 
"&gt;  Each relationship is unique and each relationship has another timeline. 

Yes, and no. I agree that different things work for different people. But I definitely think that there are universal red flags, too. There was a post here about how the OP's BF kept saying ""don't compare your relationship to theirs, we're not ready for marriage"" after, like 5 years - at a certain point, comparisons do serve a purpose of measuring social norms. And I think it's valid for OP to want to know what the holdup is, even if the reason that inquiry came to be is due to others' engagements.

Overall, I agree with you, though. Comparison is a thief of joy, I just think that it is human nature to see others' lives and reflect on your own, too. Because you're right: they need a timeline that works for OP *and* her BF - the fact that they don't have a mutually beneficial timeline is a crucial thing to address "
"That could make sense, assuming OP went to Japan for college and got married straight out of it,but in that case, this has happened in a REALLY short period of time. I mean, that means in a year, they have:

* moved back to the US and in with the mother (all is fine...let's say 2 months for this?)

* Found their own house, bought it, moved in, and had all appparently remain fine for MONTHS. (And it takes, what, 3 months minimum to go through with a house purchase, so let's say that this period was 6 months total)

* Stuff starts deteriorating with mother, a few conversations are had, before OP starts to worry about his wife's mental state and asks his mother to leave (let's say this takes a minimum of a month)

* OP thinks all is fine for approximately a month afterwards but is distressed that his wife 'still isn't over things'.

Like....dude, adding this all up, your mother can't have been out of your house for more than 2 months. 8 frigging weeks - that's all! She distressed your wife to the point that you had to kick her out of the house, and you expect her to just be over it with next to no recovery time? She's a person, not a machine - give her at least 6 months of minimum contact and you putting your NUCLEAR family first (that's your wife and kids, not your parents and siblings) and let her get out of it.

Also, side eye that apparently your wife's mental state deteriorated to the point you thought she was a danger to herself or others, and the only thing you did was remove your mother from the situation. That suggests one of two things: either you knew the only thing effecting her mental health was your mother and you still let it escalate to that point (why why why) or your wife needs real, serious, professional help, and you're here asking why she's being meeeean to your mommy on the internet. Just...WTF."
"Sorry to jump in here, and I'm surprised nobody has mentioned it, but can you get your wife to a doctor? Sudden behavior changes (especially from things seeming fine and then it's all hellfire) and erratic responses can mean something scary like a tumor. I'd want to rule things like that out asap."
"Have you talked with him about the issue explicitly? If so and he is not able to change or interested in changing his behavior, cut yourself loose."
"&gt; she starts lying like crazy

&gt; So.... how do I bring it up with her?

You don't. You keep this relationship casual or move on.

&gt; I do not want to dump her because I think it would hurt her more. 

This is not healthy reasoning."
Is she from a religious background by any chance?
"“I’ve actually just decided to keep the dress shopping private since I’m a bit nervous about it, but would you be able to come to flower/cake/band meeting? I’d love to have you there!” Then make sure your parents don’t post about dress shopping on Facebook.

"How is it to spite another person? She's already stated she is done having children, that is 100% her right and if she wants it done permanently she still has that right. I wouldn't recommend her doing it without her husband knowledge but she doesn't need his permission. "
"I really don't think this is salvagable.  Do you want to be with someone who doesn't know how to apologize?  You told him that he hurt your feelings and disappointed you, and he basically tried to turn it around on you.  

I don't know if it's exactly gaslighting but that doesn't make it less shitty.  It sounds like you are sexually incompatible, and he's insensitive.  You're going to great lengths to accommodate him and he does not even make time for you.  He also refuses to work on his issue in therapy.  

I would not move across the country with him until he makes progress with the sex issue and learning when to admit when he's wrong and feel remorseful about it. "
"I’ve fostered cats too so I get it, but there are limits. It sounds like she has gone overboard with it and this needs to be addressed. Try to talk to her about it and set some boundaries. Either limits on the number, frequency, or both. If she cares about you she will be willing to compromise. It’s not like you are asking her to stop entirely so hopefully she will be willing to agree to some boundaries on this."

Why are you mad at your ex and not your current boyfriend? Both men sound like such dirtbags. 
"have you apologized? have you expressed the magnitude of what you failed to do as a partner? you let her down in the biggest way. in her lowest moment, she couldn't depend on you. does she know that you GET that? not because you're afraid of losing her, feeling rejected, but because you know she was hurting that whole time? 

yes, you were sick. but there's treatments for it. there are coping strategies to mitigate the damage. she was also healing. 

it sounds like you had, what, not even a year of equal? healthy? partnership before you lost your job? that's not really very long to know each other and learn to work together as a team. do you have a job now (sounds like yes?)? were there any good times in the year-ish between the job loss and the car accident? it's looking like 75% of your relationship wasn't an actual partnership. and now it's been only two months. 8 weeks. that's barely enough time to try a new SSRI. you are going to have to be far more patient. your brain doesn't heal and become undepression-prone in 2 months. her heart won't, either. 

i know it's heart breaking, but i can completely understand her walking away. she needs to know she can depend on you. and she's gotten in the habit of not asking for your support or help. it's not meant to be hostile. it's self-preservation. the counseling may help her to open up, but ultimately that's something she has to want to do. you can't make her work on forgiveness and trust if she's had enough pain and disappointment already. she agreed to go to that appointment, even though she isn't feeling like there is a future. that's actually a BIG thing that she's giving you. keep at it. 

show her what you're going to do differently to manage your mental health and stay connected with her even if you have low spots. you didn't mention that in the changes you feel you have made. if the difference is only that you saw divorce coming, then what will keep you motivated/active if she decides to stay? what happens next life-crisis when your brain conks out on you again? 

assess the household division of work: it's not truly about house projects, although doing what you say you will do is part of it. it's about paying attention to her feelings and needs, appreciating what she does, and taking on a more equal share. how much burden of managing everyday things did she take on when you were out of commission? can you take some of those things back? read up on emotional labor. do a time-chart of which chores/errands/planning each of you does in a week. don't wait for her to tell you what needs doing. 

both of you should spend time with other friends &amp; family. don't rely your entire social lives on each other. have other people to talk to, to be validated by, to vent to. take some of the burden off each other. but also, possibly try something new together. have adventures. date each other. dream about possible futures. show her a partner who is worth having. 

sure, she might not be romantic or particularly open with you for a while. she has a lot of pain to get over. it's not her job to try and make you happy, or to reassure you that she will be there. she might not be. if you're going to try, it has to be for your own respect and approval, not hers.  learning to do any of these things are useful for you whether she decides to stay in the marriage, or not. "
"Ok, going through this:

* your wife might not have thought this through, but neither did you and you were the one with the knowledge and advantage here, having lived in both countries. Honestly, you should have erred on the side of protecting your wife. You are asking a huge amount of her - not only to go from one country to another, but one culture to another, one of which is hideously alien in comparison. That's difficult enough, but then to ask her to add another adult to the household, but one that in her culture she'd be subserviant to? Huge, huge amount. No wonder. To give an example, expat communities normally recommend anywhere between 2 and 5 years to settle into a new country - you've asked her to deal with twice the challenge in half the time while juggling kids. How old are your children? If they're still primary school age, that's going to make things so much harder because she'll be helping them adjust too.

* arguments, you shouldn't have been the go-between. You and your wife should have been a team, making decisions, and then it would be your responsibility to communicate those decisions to your mother, not running back and forth like some translator, which will mean your wife will have felt vulnerable and exposed, because if your mother took offense at anything, it would obviously be her fault, rather than a decision the pair of you had made. I will say again - teamwork. You two need to operate as a TEAM. The arranging things, if it frustrated your wife, should have also frustrated you, not you just passing the annoyance along while claiming to have no part in it.

* Money: Your mother should have gotten alimony if she was prevented from working outside the home during marriage, not just child support. If she didn't, she got stiffed, and that's sad, but isn't something you should have to compensate for forever. She was, by your numbers, 55 when you started subsidising her. My mother picked up a new career at that age. It's hard and a bit of a PITA, but it can be done, and what's more, should have been done, rather than just expecting her children to subsidise her forever. When you started paying her, there should have been discussions about how this would work in the long run, and what the plan was, rather than just the expectation that you'd keep shelling out.

Yeah, I think marriage counselling, ideally with someone with a experience of Japanese culture and the transition to living in the US, will be very helpful for you."
"This. Guys act stupid around attractive girls even if they LITERALLY have no intentions to cheat or anything like that. It didn’t make you feel good, so you talked about it, and he recognized it and apologized.

"&gt; you cant scrutinize others for their financial choices while holding out your hand.

Buuullllshit he can't. They set up a verbal commitment with their son. His only problem was assuming his parents wouldn't fuck him over, which to be blunt, is damned pathetic on their part. They had a discussion about the upcoming semester, they informed him that they would continue helping out financially, and when it came time to assist on *allergy shots*, they near literally kick him to the curb and to go to Disney World/Land (I say near-literally, because there was no physical kick). 

It's not like the kid is a slug, sitting on the couch all day playing vidja games. He has two jobs. He's paying what he can. He's holding up his end of the deal. They're the ones who failed here. Now, his immediate academic future is put in flux because they can't handle living up to their word.

&gt; Did you need to take extra classes?? It sounds like you made your life harder than it needed to be.

That was the plan that his parents agreed to in the first place. He took on extra responsibility *because* he had a conversation with his parents and they came to an agreement. Now they're not only reneging, they're booting him for calling them out."
I’m 24 and had a friend like kelly who is also 35. I couldn’t remain friends with her. I felt like I was the adult and she was the child most of the time. Then I realized there is probably a reason she hands out with young 20 somethings because people her age couldn’t stand her childish behavior.

"&gt;Well you've been together for 4 years. How does he get ""sensitive"" when you tell him that there aren't appropriate times for him to be grabbing you? You say he gets angry, how?

You're being told the truth and that may feel like you're being torn down but that isn't why people are saying it. 

What do you want? To have a relationship with your son or to feel like everyone agrees with you and pile on SIL? What if the only way to have the relationship with your son is to be open to SIL and let her know how happy you are she is a part of your sons life? To embrace her and let son know he can have both of you. Wouldn't that be worth it to have the relationship you want with your son? He has to feel like you won't take SIL from his life to open up and become close with you."

Take times when you stop and reflect and try to look back if you've been objectively equal to all three of your kids. Don't remember it's his home too, he will grow with you as a fatherly role whether you accept it or not and you will be one of the rocks he will look for support.

"A friend growing up in NJ was Mormon. 

She would tell funny stories about church dances where they were all reminded to leave room for the Book of Mormon between them. Their retort would be, ""My Book is on CD-ROM!""

She was pretty chill, though we were all impressed she got up early and did religious study at church (temple?) in the morning BEFORE school. None of us considered it possible to get up that early and still function.

She also took off the button up she wore out of the house and wore just her tank top at school (except for the period she knew she would pass her older sister in the hallway).

She also dated before 16.

Anyways, she went to BYU and appears happily married now almost 20 years later.

My impression of Mormons therefore was always positive, if slightly confused."
"It sounds like this has been brewing since your youth. While you didn't confront him about your pain, except that one incident, you finally stood up to him and set boundaries. And he doesn't like it, so he's pulling a megatantrum. So now you have a choice: grovel and try to win him back or actually keep your stance and stop looking for his approval. 

Do what's best for your mental state. He's elderly and your relationship has never been without its issues. If you pick it up again after some heavy apologizing, it will continue with that pattern where he puts you down, but that might be the best version of a bond with your parent you'll get. Your brothers get a different version, this is what it's going to continue to be for you. The why's don't really matter as there's likely no answer that will satisfy or answer all those niggling questions. 

You could also see if you perhaps need some counseling and basically grieve the parent you never had and wish you could've enjoyed. With the intention of never contacting your father again. You could dive into possible why's with the counselor then and again never get a proper answer. It could help you with unburdening yourself of the put downs you've been cherising the past years.

The puppy did things it wasn't supposed to do, because that's what puppies do. And it sounds like your mother and her BF left all messes for the neighbor to clean, which was thoughtless.

"STOP giving him money, and change your PINs, and maybe even change your accounts to a different bank, too, because he will get desperate for gambling funds once you cut him off. He's already stole from you (taking more money out of your account than he said he would IS stealing). Sign up for online-only statements (not paper), too, and change your banking passwords.

If you want to keep dating him, make it contingent on him getting professional help for his gambling. Don't settle for ""I promise I'll quit."" And KEEP YOUR FINANCES SEPARATE!"
"So...is he unattractive? Lazy? Difficult? What it is, exactly, that you don't want to pass on to a child?"
"She hasn't really told me when she's moving out. Some time during the week when I'm at work. She needs her brother's truck and he works weekends, so a weekday is the only time she can do it. That's my fear that since I won't be home, she'll just take the cat with the rest of her stuff and leave. "
"So, you kept talking to this girl even though your gf had asked you not to, just to get her back for talking to guys you didn't like?  That is immature and does not bode well for your relationship.

"You don't pay by the hour for salon services. You pay for the end result, and the time is not billable since the stylist should have estimated that in the quote.

She knew your hair, you knew how long it was supposed to take, and you need to tell the salon manager. "
"Nope. 

One thing you may not realize is that injectable chin fillers are for people who want a small, nearly undetectable increase in the size of their chin. No reputable plastic surgeon would suggest an injectable for someone who “literally has no chin”. Rubberized silicone implants are the gold standard for that level of adjustment.

The problem is that rubberized silicon implants are so successful and so worry-free that the patient rarely if ever needs any more work done. It’s a dead end for the surgeon’s income flow, and a good surgeon will absolutely accept that because a good surgeon cares more about the patient having a good end result than “income flow” (after all, a good surgeon doesn’t need to create income flow other than with talent; patients flock to a surgeon who has good results). Injectables on the other hand require expensive yearly visits. 

This surgeon is shady af. Either your chin isn’t as small as he says it is or the remedy he’s recommending isn’t the right one - which makes me wonder if he’s the best choice for the procedure you’re already having."
"I agree with everyone recommending that you find some other place for both of your cats to stay temporarily until your ex moves out and the locks are changed. 

Also, do not let her be vague about when she is moving out, because you want to make sure you and a friend are there when she is removing stuff from the place. Breakups make people crazy and vindictive, and even people you'd never think would stoop so low have been known to steal stuff if allowed to move out unsupervised.

Is she already staying elsewhere? Can you change the locks now and have her make an appointment with you to pick up her stuff?"
Yeah if it's the US most places require 30 days and an official eviction notice.
If she's that bothered by it then she can buy you a replacement laptop. Tough chance of that happening so she needs to get over it. She's moving mad.
"My issue with this response is that a lack of understanding and a religious background are no excuse for being so aggressively rude. People can be uncomfortable with a situation and still be polite and kind. Ignorance is not an excuse for cruelty.

"Thank you for your response. He earns significantly more than I do, but we pay equal rent, bills etc, food shopping we share, we don't really keep track and it's always been that way. He probably spends a bit more money on dates, drinks and meals, but other than that, we're equals financially. 

I don't want the money, and wouldn't have asked him for it, but feel if we've been given the money to cover the expense, it should have been given to me, or at least he could have made me aware of it. "
"You can break up with your partner if you want to explore your sexuality and try new things.

Are you sure you're not overvaluing being famous? It's irrelevent to your problem. Take a step back, you barely know this guy.

But be prepared that he's busy and doesn't feel the same way "
"Yes, it's a conflict ... with a very, very simple solution (or rather, a few solutions):

1. Live somewhere with two bathrooms.
2. You get up earlier for your bath.
3. She starts getting ready in the bathroom while you're still in the bath.

You like a long, leisurely wake up before work. She likes to hustle and run. Figure it out."
"My parents had a LOT of rules when I moved in.  It’s a very nice/expensive house in an expensive area so I do get it. They’re... interesting people and overly strict sometimes about this stuff, but I accepted their stipulations and appreciate their generosity. 

I could definitely spend the night somewhere with the kids at some point. I’ll set that up. "
"It's not always easy to laugh something off when it genuinely hurts. 

When you mix in the abusive relationship(s) of the past and how hard her current partner slapped her, it could've really scared her in the moment. It's important to have a discussion about boundaries. OP's BF should've been gentler in the moment because of her history, and OP may need to return to therapy."
"Etsy is a great place to find beautiful rings with almost all the same designer styles, and many of them are ethically sourced metals and gems or lab created! Do try to discuss it with her. It should never be about the ring; it's purely symbolic. If the value of the ring is what matters more than the declaration to spend your lives together, there's a problem. "
"So I personally would not want a $16K ring and I’m sympathetic to your perspective. I think the 3 months rule is ridiculous. However, I think you’re falling into the trap of prioritizing your own opinions over hers on what should be a gift to her.

If you couldn’t afford a pricey ring I would completely respect that. But you said you’re willing to buy her a car because at least it has functional value. So you are willing to spend the money — just not on a ring, because you think it’s stupid. However, this is a gift to her, and the ring will mean a lot more to her than the car. It’s not stupid to her, and that’s what should matter to you.

If I were you I would work something out with her (such as her paying part of the cost, or looking at less expensive rings too). But you need to start from the position that what she wants matters, even if you don’t personally see the value. This won’t be the last time you two make a big purchase because one of you wants something — it’s part of marriage, making room for what your partner values.

We see a lot of guys in here complaining that “engagement rings are a scam / pointless / not rational” but we need to recognize that as an opinion not some universal truth. She had a different opinion, so respect it and work from there. That way you can tackle the “3 months salary” part (which I think is bullshit) separately from the whole “it’s a stupid rock that has no value” argument.

I paid for my own engagement ring. I love it. I’m sure you two can find some type of middle ground.

Edit: Everyone is acting like nobody spends $16K on an engagement ring. And here comes everyone who got proudly engaged with a 50 cent plastic ring because their love is just that pure. 16K not actually that uncommon among those who can afford it. A lot of people do buy into that 3 month rule.

I spent less than that on my wedding and ring combined, but I know a few people with pricey engagement rings. They aren’t shallow or stupid or selfish. This is a difference of opinion that can be resolved with compromise. She’s not some evil greedy shrew for wanting an expensive ring. Please don’t let reddit convince you otherwise. Talk to her, work it out."

"A boob job is not the same as teeth whitening. A better comparable is shaving legs and arms pits, and wearing make up. Technically, if he accepted his bride just as she was, she would not do those things on her wedding day. But I guarantee you that she is doing those things. She probably going to even get a professional tondo her make up, covering up her facial imperfections. So it seems fair to me to ask him to whiten his teeth. "

Tell her what you're doing immediately. Give her the opportunity to either help you hold yourself accountable through therapy or leave you.
Get a separate hamper for your clothes. Keep it on your side of the bed. Would that fix it?

"OP, I don't know if this helps, but by the time a person's remains have become ashes, there is no organic material left.  The living parts that made up your mom's body are gone.  All that stuff about making your ashes into a tree pod or whatnot are just a gimmick to help the deceased's surviving family.  The only things left are dry minerals.  The ashes aren't your mom.  They're not her body, in the sense that a body is a biological organism.  Your mom exists in you, your dad, and all the people she touched in her lifetime.  She exists in whatever actions you take to commemorate her and show how much you love her.  She exists in the way you live your life.  In this case, I think it's possible that she exists in the option to give your dad the most peace you can."
"Listen, OP. My mother died very unexpectedly in January of this year. She was cremated. If someone accidentally lost her ashes, I would absolutely want to know. This really isn't something you can lie about. 

Please do not listen to people who say 'it doesn't matter' or 'don't tell him because it'll cause unnecessary hurt.' 

It does matter. And your father deserves to know. This isn't something you can honestly keep secret for the rest of your life. If you tell this lie, you have to keep up the lie forever. 

That will weigh on you. Please do not burden yourself in that way. Please do not create a wedge between you and your father by lying. This is a time when unity is paramount--do not create distance between you and him. "

"You should figure out what you want to do with your life, and make your decision based on that. No point in being a physician for the so-called ""prestige"" and money if your life is going to be a living hell the next ten years through med school/residency/fellowships. Also 50% of US med students come out of school being over 250K dollars in debt. 


PAs can assist in surgeries and work in the OR, while a pathologist could never see a patient the rest of their lives. It's all dependent on what you want to do. You shouldn't base your decision on the fact that ""you could do better"" or because it's what your boyfriend wants. Being a doctor is a lifestyle that you commit to, even if it means giving up the best years of your life, or giving up spending time with your (future) kids. "

And even if it is an admirable thing to do to take care of your parents, I don’t feel like it should be mandatory. As a parent, I’ve especially found this to be true. When my daughter grows up, I want her be happily independent and free. People have children to give them a good life, not to get a free caregiver out of the process. Parents should never leech off of their children to their detriment. I chose to have my daughter, but she didn’t choose indentured servitude.

Edit to add: I will for sure be a caregiver to my own parents. They’ve given me so much and I’ll pay it back. But if that would possibly harm my own future, I know they’d absolutely deny my help."
"You absolutely nailed this.  OPs post is remarkably scant on details.  On top of it she doesn't seem to demonstrate any sort of remorse about how things played out, nor does she try to explain any efforts she made to make her husband less upset.  I am sure his resentment was not a random occurrence.  The parents skipping out on the bill is probably another symptom of the bride here going overboard as well but she doesn't want to admit it...

"Spot on. Plus, honestly, by the time most of us are 21 we've purged the majority of our high school friends because, hey, as it turns out proximity and being ""kind of the only decent or interesting person around"" does not make for lifelong friendships! OP and Molly only ended up friends because they both didn't fit in, not because they were a great match for each other, and that's okay! That's... Kind of what high school is like for a kid lot of people. OP is going to start her post-secondary school life in much better shape *without* Molly hanging around her shoulders and guilting her for **being sick.** If she's this uncompassionate about a visible illness, I can only imagine how awful she'll be about any of the myriad of common problems friendships have transitioning into adulthood. Good riddance, imo. It might feel awkward finishing out the year without Molly, but OP is much better off in the long run.

**Edit:** and I say this as someone who met her best friend in *elementary* school. We only got closer as life got harder because we realized we'd both be there for each other in whatever way we could."

Because that girl gratefully went and sat with *two strangers* for half an hour rather than talk to this dude for another second. You don’t do that unless you feel it’s the best/safest way to get out of the situation.

It’s ok to be miffed that a date night didn’t turn out as planned. But it’s not ok to keep bringing it up, especially after OP has already apologized.

OP, I think this is the sort of thing you’ll need to work out I person, but I think it IS something you can work out together. 

Some questions you might want to have in your back pocket:

What would he prefer you do it you see something similar again? Discuss it with him first? Not do anything? - make him be specific, because it might also help you both to know that there are some things you won’t compromise on. (So maybe a heads-up would be ok with you both, but you won’t agree to ignore it)

What is his best possible outcome RIGHT NOW? You can’t go back in time, so what would make both of you feel loved and appreciated in your relationship going forward?

Are you a couple that shouldn’t argue over text?"

"Wow. I would love to be your boyfriend. Pizza is my absolute favorite food. But still, 50 pizzas. Even I can’t eat that. 

I don’t know if you live in the city or what, but if you do, you should think about giving the pizza away to homeless people. Not only will the pizza not go to waste, but you’ll also have made someone’s day, if not week. Seeing the face on someone after receiving a free pizza is just priceless. I think all the joy you two can bring is worth far more than any gift you could have got him. 

I don’t know if it’s just me, but I feel great after giving something away to somebody less fortunate. Multiply that by 30, and you’ll be ecstatic. "
"&gt; He gets really attached to stuff, at the end of the day. And that's something I have to respect.

Nothing at all wrong with that. It's just that he doesn't seem to anticipate that when his attachment affects other people, like, say, his wife, during *their* wedding, they might want a say in how he expresses that attachment.

&gt; A little over a year and a half.

These tirades, has it always been like this? That's really unhealthy."
Consent to being recorded doesn't constitute consent to having it posted publicly. That's why he should be upset for her. I can't believe I just had to explain either part of that.
"Just feeling you shouldn't have to pay for that mistake doesn't matter. The consequences remain the same no matter how you feel about it. You chose to have unprotected sex, you chose to not pull out to attempt to prevent pregnancy, and now you have a baby on the way. If you did not consent to having a child you should have tried harder to prevent pregnancy. "
"Could also be embarrassed. However, all outcomes plausible."
"It's definitely not hard to do at all.

You text him ""I want to break up. It's over"". And then it is.

You aren't lost at all. You are fully aware that what he is doing is not cool. That's why you have this sense that something is up. That's why you are here on reddit asking people ""Does it seem sketchy that my bf is using Tinder to make female friends?"" And **everyone** is saying ""Yup, he sounds like he is using your naivety to his advantage and lying to your face while trying to cheat on you""

So let me ask, how are you lost? You have all the answers you need. Your suspicions are confirmed. Everything you suspect is right.

So no, you are not lost. You are trying to find anything you can to convince yourself that the reality in front of your face is not true. But it is.

So if you choose to do mental gymnastics and deny the very obvious signs in front of you, you will have no one to blame but yourself when you find out he was cheating on you.

And you will be hard pressed to find any sympathy if you ignore all the advice telling you to leave now."

"Okay.  I'll let other people decide.  Here is an actual excerpt from *A Spell for Chameleon*:

&gt;“She says she was walking down by the Gap,” the bailiff said, looking at his notes. “He came up behind her, grabbed her, and raped her. Right, girls?”

&gt;The three girls nodded, each looking hurt and angry. The knee of the girl facing Bink shook, and another ripple traveled up his leg. What an opposite lady, and what a play!

&gt;“He says he was standing there and she came up and made a suggestion and he took her up on it. Right, men?”

&gt;Bink nodded with the others. He hoped his side won; this was nervous business.

&gt;Now the judge spoke. “Was it close to a house?”

&gt;“ ’Bout fifty paces,” the bailiff said.

&gt;“Then why did she not scream?”

&gt;“He said he’d push her off the brink if she made a sound,” the bailiff answered. “She was frozen in terror. Right, girls?”

&gt;They nodded—and each looked terrified for a moment. Bink wondered which of the three had been raped. Then he corrected his thought: which one had made the accusation? He hoped it wasn’t the one facing him.

&gt;“Were the two known to each other before?”

&gt;“Yes, Your Honor.”

&gt;“Then I assume she would have run from him at the start had she not liked him—and that he would not have forced her if she trusted him. In a small town like this, people get to know one another very well, and there are few surprises. This strongly suggests she had no strong objection to being with him, and may have tempted him, with a result she later regretted. I would probably, if this case were to come up in court, find the man not guilty of the charge because of reasonable doubt.”

&gt;The three men relaxed. Bink became aware of a trickle of sweat on his forehead; it started while he listened to the judge.

&gt;“Okay, you have the judge’s ifso,” said the bailiff. “You girls still want to bring it to open trial?”

&gt;Looking betrayed, the three girls shook their heads no. Bink felt sorry for the girl across from him. How could she not be seductive? She was a creature constructed for no other visible purpose than ra—than love.

I'll just repeat that last line, the thought of the protagonist, whom we are supposed to find sympathetic:

&gt;She was a creature constructed for no other visible purpose than ra—than love."

"You literally left her to dance with other girls. That is the definition of ignored. 

When you see your partner isn’t having fun you stay with them, talk to them on the sidelines until he/she feels comfortable enough to dance (or leave and do something they want to do). Sounds like your friends were giving her attention while you were dancing with their gfs."
"I was guessing Iguana, which could have at least been shortened to Iggy."
"She has just shown you that she has been capable of treating you decently *this whole time* and is only now deciding to put in the effort. Once she is convinced that you will stay, she is going to stop putting in the effort and revert back to her abuse. Of *course* she doesn't want to divorce. If she stays married, she can do and say whatever she wants and still get her way. She doesn't have to work, and she can buy whatever she wants with your money. This is the best possible setup for her. 

This friend is right- the child will be the most affected, but they are wrong about you two ""needing"" to stay together. Your son has lived in chaos for his whole life, and it's bad enough that his mother is emotionally abusive. If you are able to stick it out through custody hearings (do not delete any abusive texts or email chains), it is very likely that you will gain custodial rights since you are the only one with a stable source of income. **Edited to add:** your son will blossom once you get used to a life without her, because you will be able to parent without the stress of trying to manage her maelstrom of demands and insults.

I am sorry you are in this difficult position. For your sake (and your son's), divorce sounds like the best long-term option."
"As for plans/info requests, maybe just don't follow up on those at all unless the person has asked you on at least two occasions. Asking again at a later date shows they remember the request and are still interested."

He also strikes me as the type of person that has raped or eventually will. He has no respect for a woman's consent. 
Mmm your description of approaching women in public is just that. I think the gist of what people are saying is don't randomly approach women in public and try to hit on them. 
"I agree. This all came from a place of concern and love. It sounds like he has a good relationship with his family. He obviously wanted to spend as much time as possible with them, so I don't think they did it to be hurtful. All they want to do is make sure that he is healthy, and around for a long time. They just want whats best for him. I know it stings to be told the things that were said, but maybe he needed to hear them? Sometimes things don't really set with us until someone really calls you out on it. 

OP - I would give yourself a day or two to think it over, but I don't think you should go home. Just tell your family that you are thinking over everything that they have said, but would rather talk about it at a later time. You are an adult and they can't make you do anything. That even means healthy, but what they can do is support your will to change for the better. "

"As someone who works in a family business, your business WILL fail if you do not cut this woman out of it.

She is NOT going to do what is necessary for it to succeed.

That said, YOU cannot run a business without confrontational skills. How can you run a business successfully when you are too timid to confront your own partner? You will never be able to fight for yourself and your business in meetings and deals. I’d advise you to learn sooner rather than later."
"The reason it's different is because his dad specifically gave him gas money, knowing full well that his son's girlfriend had been driving. It's just casually dishonest to be like ""thanks for the gas money dad"" and then not give it to the person who paid for the gas."
"You were right to be upset. In your place, I would have played from more strength as if a negotiation, e.g., tell him: ""I need concreteness on tonight or I will make other plans."" And then go out with or cook for someone else. There are ways to play the game

But honestly, honey, after 3 months you shouldn't be playing the game, and if this dude makes you prove yourself to him, he's not your guy. He's an asshole and will never not be an asshole. Throw him back."
"&gt; make thoroughly sure he knows this is not OK

The problem is that I expect he DOES know it is not ok, but doesnt care - THATS what needs addressing"
You're probably right. It's hard for me to think about doing it long term because I am spread so thin right now but better to have it and not need it than the inverse. 
"I feel like we should have some compassion for op's GF,

The impression im getting is that she's worked really hard for her degree and been kind of beat down in the job market for so long that its tearing her apart.

Like i don't think op's girlfriend actually has bad people skills, i think that seeing op's cousin kind of just walk into a job really got to her and shes venting in the only way that she feels like she can. I think people can become a bit aggressive when they feel like their cornered and have nowhere to go.

I think a better decision would be to support her, maybe point her to some resources that she may not be using, ect. I feel like she needs more people to be close to her and support her, not everyone to rip on her calling her entitled and whatnot."
"Leave her alone.  I used to do this to my sister because I genuinely thought I was helping her, but you're just insulting her.  Don't try to ""fix"" her.  Just be her friend."
"Honestly, you sound a little delusional. You try to come up with pseudo-analytical reasons for why he doesn't want to be with you, rather than just accepting that he might simply not see in you what you see in him. just because you feel like he checks all your boxes doesn't mean you do the same for him. leave that guy alone. your fixation is somewhat scary.
 
"
"I'm guessing the hate train is because her parents are so glaringly oblivious to the problems she's now facing. They refuse to sympathize.

Given your specific example, it's not so much wrong as it is unnecessary. On an institutional level, racism from black people towards white people simply doesn't have the same effect, not by a long shot. AFAIK it's a non-conversation in white households (especially ones who claim to be colorblind). 

But I mean, I'm black, and I know it is absolutely imperative for black parents to teach their kids about racism from white people. Especially when it comes to whites in authority--*especially* law enforcement. Knowing that people would assault you, even kill you based on a conscious or subconscious bias is definitely something I would need to tell my kid, so that they know how to act around these people.

So in general, why would it be wrong? It's your job as a parent to prepare you for the world, which includes telling your kids how people will perceive you, and teaching them to how to effectively respond and cope in those situations. It also helps not to be blindsided about these issues as you get older, which seems to be part of the problem for this girl."
"She's traumatized because her husband raped her. She literally can't relax, bodies don't process trauma in that way. "
Holy fuck I wanna puke that was the most horrible thing I've ever read and I literally just finished reading a post about a MIL killing her granddaughter with coconut oil.
"She's giving you this ultimatum to see if you're really serious and committed to the relationship. She has feelings for you and doesn't want to potentially get dragged along for a while just to find out you're not into her. Not only would that waste her time but it would make her look like a fool to everyone she knows talking about falling for a guy and then him just saying he wasn't interested after months. I would say if you're becoming a better person and still enjoy her company after a month just say yes, you like her.

You're not full on getting engaged to her after a month, just make it exclusive and see how well you guys mesh and what changes with that exclusiveness. You'll still be free to leave if at any time it isn't working. "
"Start driving for Lyft or Uber. It's reasonably easy to get signed up if your car is 7 years old or younger. You can start getting rides the same day the car is inspected, and you EARN MONEY every day. Not a perfect job, but hey! You're driving all  over anyway. Might as well make money at it.

It will get the GF off your ass and who knows, you might really like it!"
"This is true, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Do you think some people *enjoy* working these shit jobs? Most don't. My last job (before my current job) was with Dept of Homeland, but I moved out of state and couldn't find anything. I had to settle for working in the bakery of a grocery store and it sucks more than you could imagine.

I look for better work every single day before/after work, and though I make pennies, at least I'm making *something* to help, even if it's just enough money for some groceries and my cell phone bill.

Not to be rude, but I can see why your GF is mad. NO job is beneath ANYONE. Like I said, you gotta do what you gotta do. I rather make $100 in a week, than $0."
"Hey OP, does any of this look familiar?

&gt; The following dynamics are typical of a relationship with Mr. Sensitive and may help explain your feeling that something has gone awry: 

&gt; You seem to be hurting his feelings constantly, though you aren’t sure why, and he expects your attention to be focused endlessly on hisemotional injuries. If you are in a bad mood one day and say something unfair or insensitive, it won’t be enough for you to give him a sincere apology and accept responsibility. He’ll go on and on about it, expecting you to grovel as if you had treated him with profound cruelty.

&gt; When your feelings are hurt, on the other hand, he will insist on brushing over it quickly. He may give you a stream of pop-psychology language (“ Just let the feelings go through you, don’t hold on to them so much,” or “It’s all in the attitude you take toward life,” or “No one can hurt you unless you let them”) to substitute for genuine support for your feelings, especially if you are upset about something he did. 

&gt; None of these philosophies applies when you upset him, however. With the passing of time, he increasingly casts the blame on to you for anything he is dissatisfied with in his own life; your burden of guilt keeps growing."
"OP absolutely is a victim, and I wasn't trying to avoid that (I also don't think being a victim disempowers her). But if she plans to stay with this guy they'll need to address the situation. I suggested marriage counseling as a neutral ground to start having that conversation. I completely agree that OP should focus on her own emotional well-being before taking that step.

I guess I was trying to give OP advice in her context. Other comments have pointed out that this is sexual assault, she disagreed, I didn't feel like I needed to make the same point again. I wasn't trying to minimize the legal reality of sexual assault, and I apologize if it came off that way."
At least they have a job...
Wow. That is telling.
"Also, it seems like they're both still living in apartments, and even though they're college educated jumping from no kids and 3 money to 3 kids and no money is assumedly not a financial option they're ready for."
"I'd definitely tell him. Just expect to be cut off as a friend because I don't see him reacting well to someone calling him out on his creepiness. He'll probably tell you that you hate strong men because your father was a strong man or something.

He doesn't sound like a nice person to be around honestly."
"You have good reason to be wary. What happens when you’ve signed a lease together, and he doesn’t have his share of the rent? What about when utilities are due, and he doesn’t have his portion?

If you’re feeling resentful about covering a movie ticket, imagine how you’re going to feel when it’s more significant amounts. Or how you’ll feel when he owes you money but buys nonsense like video games. 

I’d think long and hard before tying yourself to him legally (by signing a lease together). If things go south, your credit rating and rental history will be jeopardized. "

"It's not impossible, but the fact that they already have names picked out and that OP is in an even bigger mess than he was originally and seams pretty cheery about having multiple kids with someone he doesn't really know and just learned lied majorly to him . . . that's what seems unrealistic to me.  But he's going to be a father whether he wants to or not now so I guess he might as well put on a happy face."
"He tried to cheat and you caught him and he is angry he got caught 

Be grateful you got outta that one before it was worse. Don't try to fix this, once a cheater always a cheater. Just move on to someone better."
"Any non-consensual sexual touching assault, even if you're married.

My boyfriend loves to grope me. I let him because I actually enjoy it. He doesn't make me uncomfortable with it, he doesn't touch violently (pinching? ew) and, most importantly, when I don't want him to do it, all I have to do is tell him to stop. Consent is sexy: I like him touching me because I know if I don't want him to, he will stop.

You shouldn't need to physically defend your body because in a marriage, he needs to be able to just listen to your words. 

If he doesn't listen to your words in this area, chances are there are other areas where the same idea applies. Does he ""let"" you say no to sex if he wants it, for example? Consider whether you truly want to put up with this for the rest of your life if he refuses to listen-- it might be time to lay down an ultimatum. "
"Not only did you buy them an expensive gift but they prevented you from enjoying the party they invited you too.  Assholes.

EDIT:  I have to add one more thing, because this has been bugging me at work and I finally found a way to put into words how egregious this really is.

When two people get married, they throw a party to celebrate their love with those close to them.  Guests are expected (though not required) to bring a gift to show their support and love of their newly unionized friends.  

They threw a party, you brought a gift.  Then they took you away from the party, and asked for another gift.  That is exactly what they did.  Assholes.  These people are assholes."
"Are you serious? 

You made a mistake and slept with her unprotected once. You learned she didn't take birth control seriously. She got pregnant, miscarried, so you did it again? You willfully chose this. 

Get a paternity test, and start paying child support if it's yours. If you don't support the child while it's a baby, you should not support it when it can walk and talk and becomes interesting. Pick if you're going to be a father or a check. Stop pretending you're a victim and own up to your own ridiculous choices in this. "
"Yeah, it's cool if your BF and your dad get along but this extent is kind of strange. And, that he turns around and asks to have sex with you after ignoring you all day shows how little he thinks of you. Move on, you're young and shouldn't waste your time on people like that."
The hell she isn't.  For a caregiver it is the worst kind of death.
"&gt; she does deserve 100% of the blame

maybe i'm petty, but when telling your story to friends, I feel like you should absolutely mention that **you told her she needed to get formal dog training, multiple times**, because that's truly the only way her dog was going to make real progress in recovery. **she ignored you**, and her dog ended up suffering for it.

frame it as a lessen learned/the more you know kind of thing if it makes you feel better about saying it, but i think it's a really important point. all of this was avoidable. either her dog would have gotten the help it needed, or a good trainer would have helped your friend to understand her dog's limitations."
You're in serious denial about your life and your future. That's why the answers in this thread aren't meeting your expectations. 
Why are you making excuses for her husband that raped her? Men desire sex differently than women? Since when? Says who? 
"Sounds like the reason they don't want you going on campus, is because they can't afford for you to move on campus, but they don't want to admit that (for any number of various understandable reasons).

My mental illness does not make other people’s feelings irrelevant.

This isn’t to say I’m not empathetic. It sucks that it’s a symptom of something I can’t control all the time. But sometimes, I hurt people I care about. I apologize and work with them to try better next time. Sometimes even just talking to them about it helps us both understand each other a ton."
"Just one detail, are you sure that Ben did say this or could it just have been Ashley?"
"I would say it's the opposite. If they are married, it is simple. Both parties get 50% of property and debts acquired during marriage, excluding gifts and inheritances. 

If they are not married, it turns into a long, expensive good fight. 

Everybody who has bought a house with an SO ends up writing in saying not to do this, and that they want to escape the relationship, but they can't. Some people have wound up having been sweet talked into having their name on the mortgage but not the property. Some people have paid the down payment and closing costs but their name is not on the title, and they find out too kate that they have just poured a bunch of money down a rabbit hole. That happens because one partner wants a house for themselves, and are essentially using the other partner to help finance it, especially nowadays since it is very hard to get a mortgage "

"Hey there OP. I'm not gonna tell you what to do. I'm just going to share my experience.

I dated a lot in my 20's, but didn't click with anyone until ""Mark"". We met when I was 26 and he was 28. I thought the game plan was to date, get married around 30, babies at 32-33. He kept pushing marriage back, and I was 32, so I was all ""meh, forget marriage, if it's a hang up, just bring on the babies"".

First it was ""We need better jobs"". Then ""We need more money in the bank"". Then ""Need better health insurance with better maternity benefits"". Next ""Fix up the house to be nice for baby"". You see where this is going. Every goal he set, I met. Every time he pushed the goalposts, I resented him more and more. Know why he was doing that? He didn't want marriage OR babies, but knew if he told me that, I would leave. He selfishly kept stalling me, hoping to run my clock out. (which he later admitted)

OP, don't buy a house with this man, unless you are married. Do not marry this man unless you are 1000% sure he wants babies before 35. Do not find yourself married to a man at 32, owning a house with him, having to divorce him and start over if you want kids. (Oh. Wait. I guess I did just tell you what to do. Sorry. (not really))

You need to have the ""Come to Jesus"" talk. Don't give him a year to figure out his sh*t. Do it now. (Honestly, a man that doesn't want to start trying until you are 35 and refuses to adopt sounds like he doesn't want kids)

I'm not sure it's that he has reservations about you. I suspect it's about having kids, period. At least in your timeframe. But he doesn't want to lose you either, so he's stalling/pushing goalposts.

Want to know how that worked out for me? Not so well. 46 years old, never got to get married, never got to have babies, and leaving my 20 year relationship. Because I can't get over it, can't get past it. I will NEVER get over the fact that he denied me those things. (Despite 3 different therapists. Nope. Not gonna happen)

Don't be me OP. You are not a bad person. Go after your life goals. You will regret it if you don't. I know how hard it is. Do it anyway. {{internet hugs}}"
"DO NOT buy a house with someone unless you are married. Breaking up turns into an expensive legal nightmare. Edited: for further explanation, see https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7znp1n/i_27f_am_considering_a_deadline_for_my_partner/dupvqgb/). 

Do not be ashamed for wanting what you want. You want to get married. He does not, apparantly, or at least not with you, or he would have at least proposed with a specific deadline by now. 

Do not wait. Do not fritter around for months in counseling. At your next session, tell him point blank that you want to get engaged now and marry before the end of the year. Wedding planning does not have to take.years; you are not European royalty. Does he want to get engaged, really want with an enthusiastic ""Yes!"" right now, or not? 

If not, you will be sad, but rip the bandaid off already; otherwise you will be tremendously bitter, which will destroy this relationship anyway. 

If you want to be pregnant by 30, then you need to start the process of getting over him and getting back into the dating scene now. This stuff takes time. 

When you are ready to start looking for someone, be up front about wanting to marry and have kids relatively soon (say, within a year--you still need to get to know a guy). At age 29, dating is different from how it was in your early 20s. If is okay to be more definite, it is normal to know what you want, and not want to spend years exploring every single possibility of life. 

Edited to add: ultimatums have a bad reputation because of abusive people throwing them around all the time to control their partner. 

In a case like yours, an ultimatum is an essential tool to force this relationship to shit or get off the pot. 

When you bring this up in counseling, and he says, ""I don't know,"" sadly and anxiously, that is a No. If he wanted to marry you, he would would know in no uncertain terms at that very moment. 

If he turned around a couple of days from now and said, ""Wait! Stop! I *do* want to get married!"" That would be actually worrisome. It would mean that he doesn't necessarily want to marry; he just doesn't want to go through the pain of a breakup. His actions *now* show his true feelings. 

And! He is not a bad person for not wanting to marry. He doesn't have to provide a reason or excuse. It is how he feels. 

"
"&gt; I'm saying from his point of view it might be meaningless.

But objectively it's not meaningless - whatever intention or justification he offers, it clearly isn't appreciated by her. As a good spouse you should listen when your partner tells you to stop.

&gt;If it was flipped and a guy wrote something about his wife not letting him touch her and him feeling bad about it everyone would side with him.

Some people might, just like how some people here (like yourself) are taking his side in this post. But I think the overwhelming majority of comments would say ""Wait, you grope your wife, she tells you to stop and you refuse, and you think *you're* the victim here!? Get out of town!"" Despite its reputation, r/relationships does tend to come down hard on sexual harassment and violations of bodily autonomy.

&gt;ill occasionally pinch her butt when she walks by me just to remind myself that this is all real.

Has she told you repeatedly to stop? Does she shy away from you because she fears you doing this? If so... then listen to her! Stop treating her like her body is your plaything and her protests are immaterial. You can pinch yourself if you need a reminder you're not dreaming."
"I doubt she planned it to be an interference, mostly because I doubt this girl has ever spent that amount of time thinking about anyone other than herself. I'd more likely say she's one of those Bridezillas who just assumes that now that she's getting married everyone is happy to drop their plans for her at the last minute because she's _so  special_."
"So I work in a hospital and while I don’t generally work with a patient population of young trauma patients, I have taken care of people who had long stays on our unit. This is true no matter what you’re in the hospital for: it’s boring. It’s bland walls and crappy cable tv and the same routine of meals and tests and meds day after day. If it’s okay with her hospital plan, see if you can bring her some treats: a mix of her favorite candy, a muffin from her favorite bakery, etc. She likes crossword puzzles or sudoku? Pick up a few books at the grocery store, or maybe those intricate coloring books and a new set of colored pencils. Got a new Netflix recommendation? Maybe you could watch the series at the same time and compare notes, so you can text her often without the conversation always being about another day in the hospital. Sometimes she’ll just want to get her mind off her situation and fun distractions like this that you could bring her would be super sweet.

She’s going to be spending a lot of time healing and things are going to get awkward and uncomfortable and frustrating at times. I wouldn’t suggest visiting her every day, as your relationship is still new and that would be too much IMO, so give her space when she needs it. But what I always tell my patients when they’re embarrassed or grossed out by something, I just tell them that it’s part of life and my job. So I encourage you to let her know that it’s not stuff she has to be embarrassed about either; she’s alive and recovering from a huge traumatic event, it’s okay if she has bathroom issues or icky dressing changes or she hasn’t been able to wash her hair properly in weeks because you nor the people taking care of her are going to judge her for it. Congratulate her when she makes improvements and offer words of validation and/or encouragement on her bad days; she’ll have both and she’ll appreciate you being there for the good and bad."
if your mother refuses to have your brother pay rent why on earth are you even considering upending your life to save her house LOL
"""Yo, bf, you keep telling me you will definitely get me a gift and then dont bother to actually do it-whats going on with that?

And he needs to get you a new pass key"
"Even though you don’t want to hear this, you are also pretty combative. Your post is dripping with resentment and contempt of her. I can’t imagine that when you speak to her it is a calm, rational, solution-focused conversation. That doesn’t excuse her behavior but I think it partially explains why their haven’t been productive conversations. 

If you want to stay married, get a couples therapist NOW. You will likely be surprised that she has a list of complaints about you as well. Alas, that’s how marriage works.

If you don’t want to admit that any of your own behavior has been problematic and/or can’t overcome your resentment of her, then you probably need to divorce. 

IMO either way you should go to therapy with her. Even if you do divorce, you will need to coparent and your life long term coparenting with her will be a lot easier if you don’t have so much resentment built up and you and her both have an understanding of how to talk to each other when problems with your children come up. "
"*""I’d also like you to think long and hard about why your first instinct was distrust, accusations, and no benefit of the doubt without talking to her at all. Are you sure that you are ready to be married? I’m not.""*

"Girl, I feel you. Its a well known fact that after a certain age (college age, pretty much) its damn near impossible to make new friends. People have their 'groups' and generally aren't interested in others. I've struggled with this as well.

As far as advice, you have to put yourself out there like crazy. You have to do ALL THE THINGS, meet as many people as you can, and always be open and friendly. Exhausting, I know. Sooner or later, something will stick. Volunteer, join clubs, go to events, get involved in whatever. START a club, meetup.com, basically the more people you meet, the better chances you have for finding like minded people"
Your last bit of advice is key here. OP is 18 so the pharmacy can't give the prescriptions to anyone else if OP doesn't want them to. 
"I would love to have a group of 3 or 4 friends to be close to but even that is a challenge.  My one friend works a lot and completely different hours and my sister is working and getting her phd so she is non existent for the next year or two.  I talk to both of them every day but it would be nice to get out of the house and do something.  Spa day, happy hour, a class, or anything!"
Yeah- it’s pretty awful. Hopefully she’ll heed the comments and really question her involvement with this dude. 
"She’s not expressing her opinions well but she’s right. You should be very **very** careful about this guy. It’s odd that he’d want to date a 20 year old, you two are practically worlds apart when it comes to life experience and maturity. I’m only 26 and I wouldn’t date a 20 year old. 

Many women have been in your position before only to find that they’re in a nightmare relationship. "
This is just straight illegal. You're 18.

"Overall, as others have said, it just doesn't sound like you and your gf are compatible

&gt;She also refuses to get on birth control because she hates having unnatural things in her body (but hey, tampons and processed foods don't count, right?).

^ This though is seriously fucked up thinking. There is a huuuuuuuge difference between some gauze bullets, a bag of doritos and a prescription medication that comes with a whole host of side effects - some of which are very serious and can be fatal.

Some fantastic side effects of hormonal birth control - nausea, breast tenderness, headaches, yeast infections, decreased libido, mood changes (including up to a 3x higher likelihood of suicide), cornea thickening, weight gain, and increased risk of developing a blood clot which could lead to a fatal heart attack, stroke, or pulmonary embolism.

Don't be a twat and gripe about women not wanting to subject themselves to all that. It's not the right option for everyone.

"I would stay the course until the baby is born. You have two options, keep your child or don't. If you are set on keeping your child, the decision has been made for you. She may change her mind by the delivery time. I would have one final conversation with her and let her know that your decision will be made when your child comes. 

I wouldn't take this statement from your wife as mere hormones talking. You do need to decide, but don't let her put a clock on you. You have up to the day the baby is delivered to decide. Worst case you have the baby for a few weeks while you figure out adoption options. There are many couples waiting to adopt a healthy infant. There is no real perfect time for kids. Early in your career and it is a huge derailment, later in your career and it stalls your trajectory. Life has to happen sometime or else it won't and you'll both be mid forties and no kids and then what would you feel towards your wife? 

There are a lot of options today for help after delivery of a child. You can get a nanny that will tend to the infant while you're both at work. You can go part time while your wife works full-time. After one to two years, the kid can go to daycare. This isn't a career ruining occurrence. 

"
"I scream and push him away when he gets too close but all he does is laugh and smile. I tell him he needs to keep a distance from me but then the next day he’ll do it again. The other night I wouldn’t let him stay in the same room with me so he stole the remote. ( this wasn’t the living room or open area. It was just a private room with a tv in it ) I was screaming and pushing for him to give it back and all he did was smile and comment how weak I was because I am 5’2 and 120 Lbs and he is 6’0 and like twice my weight. 

He thinks everything is a joke. "
"Keep this in mind: if you fail to protect your wife now, when she is at her most vulnerable, she may not forgive you afterwards.  She can’t stand up for herself right now.  She’s post-surgery and caring for a newborn.  If you wimp out and let your parents traumatize her, she’s got no choice - she has to put up with whatever they pull.  

But she will always remember that time, and always remember that you weren’t there for her when it mattered.  You don’t want that poisoning your marriage.  You really don’t.  

Tell your parents you won’t be opening the door if they come, and follow through.  "
"I’m prepared for this to come off wrong and be downvoted :) but, men aren’t that complicated. :) like for the billion “what do you think this means?” Kind of conversations ive had with friends, it’s really not that complex.

Bc I love spending time with you.” And instead made excuses, said he needed more time, and fled, doesn’t bode well. "

"Dude, you're being unreasonable. He has needs as well. Having 1 night of playing games a week and seeing his friends every 2\-3 weeks is a reasonable amount of time to devote to those things. Just because your dad didn't do anything on his own doesn't mean it was the right way to do things. Accept that your bf will take time for himself and you need to figure out how to build your own life so you aren't so bothered by that."

"Yes, this sounds right. 

Also, I doubt many of the other commenters have had experience in the military, but it’s a whole different animal. She’s getting dragged around to different duty stations, dude goes to training, dude deploys, all the people you know are transient, etc, etc, etc. 

It’s not easy. I actually think the girl sounds like she might be pretty great but it just having a hard time right now. "
She is playing you and the doubt you are creating in yourself about her intentions is allowing it. 
Betrayal has negative connotation with it
"IANAL but as far as I know, fathers (and mothers) can only do that if there's another parental unit coming in to pick up the slack. If, for example, the parent raising the child gets remarried and their spouse adopts the child, the non-custodial parent can sign away rights in that instance. Otherwise, I don't think there's any recourse for completely signing away parental responsibility, particularly child support."
"As a woman, hormonal birth control sucks. I refuse to use it anymore and use condoms exclusively. (As well as be aware of where I am in my cycle) I’ve had a relationship break up over it. (He tried to guilt me because I refused to go on it. I dumped him)

A woman can also takes a while to get her fertility back after coming off HBC. If I was in your fiancées situation I would not be willing to discuss it. "
"You did nothing wrong. It's your body, you can do with it what you will.

Now, having said that, I think you have to be realistic here. Most guys will react the way your boyfriend did, or worse.

140+ guys is a LOT. A looot. For me, finding out that number would be an immediate dealbreaker. I would not be able to look at you the same ever again, so it would not be fair to either of us to continue the relationship. For me that number would mean we are too different and it just wouldn't work out. Either she can disconnect sex from emotion to an extreme degree (which i think is really unhealthy) or she's gone from boyfriend to boyfriend. And if she's been through that many guys, it's probably her that's the reason why it never worked out with any of them, since she's the only consistent factor.

Anywho. I think this is probably more or less how your boyfriend feels, although he might be too invested to admit it to himself or you yet.

&gt;I can tell he is upset, and in a way I get but at the same time I am also upset he is upset, like he is judging my sexual history.

Yes, and that sucks, but we all get judged on our past all the time. You reap what you sowe, and in your case that means most guys will be disgusted by the amount of people you've slept with. Find someone who doesn't care, or make sure they never find out, but your current relationship is probably dead in the water. It's likely not gonna go anywhere positive from here. Give it a shot, see if you can work past it, but my guess is you two will eventually break up anyway. So I wouldn't waste too much time on this anymore."

"Born and raised in Oklahoma here..get the fuck out while you still can. Can you talk to your wife about maybe making long term plans to move somewhere still less urban than Brooklyn but also less redneck fuck than Oklahoma? 
I'm a white woman, dating a black man, with a mixed daughter. The city I'm from is almost equal amount of black and white people and even still there's racist undertones (or not so under tones) everyyyywhere. I've been pulled over probably nearly 10 times and the only time I've had my car searched was when my SO was in the car with me. We were pulled over off the high way in an area we had never been to in our lives and the first thing the cop said to my boyfriend was ""don't I know you from somewhere?"" Uhhh, yeah, no, guess it was the other black guy..
My boyfriend is also one of those guys who people here cannot stop pointing out ""talks white"" and has had people tell him multiple times that people were skeptical of him at first but now they realize he's okay after talking to him. 

Maybe one big talking point to bring up your wife is the totally failed education system here. My daughter is only coming upon a year old and my long term goal is to be out of Oklahoma before she starts school. Both of my cousins graduated at the top of their class in different high schools here. Both of them went to college out of state and said they immediately realized that even doing as well as they did in high school did not prepare them for an out of state university. Just some food for thought.
Sorry this comment got so lengthy but I can definitely understand the want to not stay here long term, especially if you have a young child. Good luck! 

ETA: not sure if you know but Oklahoma is 49th out of 50 in education. Millions get cut from the education budget every few months. Even college towns are racist as shit. I just moved back to my hometown from a college town. No matter where you're at here, people are gonna lock their car doors if they see you walking by them in a parking lot. "
"Lie and tell her you decided not to go through with it. Then do whatever you want, and also don't tell your roommate about it.

I get the arguments about legal prostitution, but it is also true that even legal prostitution can fuel abuse/trafficking and if she feels that strongly about the issue, she won't ever be convinced differently nor will she able to see it in any other way than as a reflection of your moral failings. Obviously her vitriol is not going to convince anyone and it's not her business what you do, but I don't see an outcome where she is able to like you as a person/stop harping on you. As I said, you do you but if you want to have a neutral relationship with roomie and gf you will have to lie convincingly."
"I just have to say that I deeply admire your commitment to her. Your love for her is obvious. She’s very lucky to have you. You saw she had a need, you helped her meet that need in the healthiest way, you are willing to walk through this journey with her. You know, there are men who are much more selfish than you would have made an inaccurate judgment about her and then bailed on her. You had empathy, you love her, so you resolved to understand her need and to do what’s best for her. I hope you two have a long and happy future together. Best of luck to you both. "
Thank you :)
Thank you for saying that :)
"I was in a relationship like this from age 17-21 or so.  Hints, signals, and then her being mad at me when I couldn't decode her bullshit.  It was so stressful, and I could never tell if she was enjoying herself or what.  About a year after that I started dating the woman I've been with for over ten years now and I can't tell you how much better life is when you're with someone who knows what they want and knows how to communicate it in plain terms.

Don't put up with people who play mind games, it's so childish and such a waste of everyone's time."
"He was at the point where you would have been married and having kids if it was up to him.  It really sounds like he was in love with you for at least part of the relationship.

And it might seem insensitive, but how else are you supposed to help someone get over you?  You explain why it didn't work out and that you've moved on, and then you give them space.  This is exactly what he did.

edit: reading more of your comments makes it pretty clear you two need to avoid each other like the plague."
"Maybe she has some eating problems. With eating disorders any kind of meal out can be a lot of pressure and holidays like Valentine's Day can add to that a lot. Maybe she still wanted to go to Outback but was setting it up to where she wouldn't have to eat very much, or at at all, but could still enjoy the date. Not eating can cause behaviours that are frustrating or confusing or unfair to the people around you. Also, OP mentions that she definitely has ADHD that she refuses to take medication for. ADHD goes hand-in-hand with other mental illnesses, especially in females. It's just something to consider and a possibility that I didn't see anyone else mention in the comments anywhere."

"Yknow, until I hit the point of him being cruel to overweight people, this seemed like something y'all could work through.

But that whole section tells you so much about his values. He doesn't respect people who don't do the exact same thing he does, he doesn't consider that people have different priorities besides just being fit, and honestly, the whole ""pain is weakness leaving the body thing"" is just unhealthy. Sometimes pain is you tearing a ligament."
"Well for example off piste (off the marked paths) skiing usually requires it's own medical, life and disability insurance. Google it. "

"Yelling isn’t cool regardless if you’re throwing shit or not. 

If a girlfriend of a year felt entitled to her boyfriends money for things that had yet to be even considered ofc people would be telling him to run and there’s proof of that all over this sub. 

Thirdly, she has been planning this trip *for years* why should she change her plans because she happens to be dating someone? She invited him on a trip she has been planning to go on for 5+ years, doesn’t mean she should cancel if he doesn’t want to go. And taking a relationship slow doesn’t mean being less committed, it means building a more solid foundation for commitment. "
OP already said the cost wasn’t at issue. 
"Right? Plus, he has known the girl for five years, has had multiple exes in that time, not including OP...I'd be curious why those relationships ended. Wonder if it has anything to do with his issues with boundaries?

Of course he isn't going to admit that his exes also had a problem with it - that would only validate OP's feelings on the matter. It's like guys who insist, ""all my exes are *crazy*,"" it's just a way to shirk responsibility and blame for why things went wrong."
"You weren’t even there, but after seeing his recent behavior don’t think there might have been more to the story he’s told you? You already admitted that he can get obsessive with women."
"He's clearly doing this because he loves the adrenaline at least as much, if not more, than he loves his sports themselves, so asking him to compromise by removing the adrenaline entirely isn't a good idea. You need to find a balance of ways he can get his adrenaline rush-- which he won't get by skiing with someone on a different level or tugging a kid behind him-- without being at the point of skiing off-trail. It sounds like you don't trust him to keep away from the backtrails without your company in regards to the skiing at least or to keep from doing something dangerous biking alone either. Let him do dangerous things, get the appropriate life and disability insurance out of his pocket, and draw the line of ""too dangerous"" way farther out than you have. "
"Yes, this is so true! My insane ex boyfriend had terrible road rage, to the point where ANY amount of road rage now makes me feel sick. He was horribly violent and on our last day together, he shot his gun at me and the bullet luckily missed me. My ex could be the man in the OP. This is a scary man and a dangerous one too. "
"That is exactly according to the pattern. If it doesn;t get cleaned, it is only going to spread from there, so your parents are right.

Of course, they don't understand, like you probably already do, that he will experience a great deal of psychological tension when it DOES get cleaned out. So, you can do it when he is gone, make him help you do it, or force him to do it. Either way, expect man-baby reaction.

So long as the end result is that he has ""his space"" that he can trash again... it'll be fine.

And he will trash it again. That's just how it works. It's a cycle.

But, generally, they're pretty happy when they have their ""clean space"" that is theirs. And even though the cycle is not fun for you, it generally provides the psychological relief that they need, knowing that they have their own place to trash, or not.

"If you think about it, a 15 year old knowing to not have sex with a child also applies to an adult and a teenager. I absolutely believe teens can freely and willfully consent with people near their age and development, but don’t you see how the power differential between a 15 year old and a 6 year old mirrors the same dynamic as a 24+ year old and a 15 year old?"
Yeah that's gross. He's just sharing nude images of this girl with his buddies? Really uncool. 
"If this goes too far and does proceed to sex, then realize that in most states the act would constitute statutory rape, regardless of if you consented to it.

"Deliberately smashing your boyfriend’s property and lying to him about it is not okay, or funny. While he needs a fan to sleep comfortably, and this is anti-comfort to you, you need to find a more mature way of solving your problems.

Different blankets. Face mask. Sleep facing the other direction so it’s not pointed at your face. Anything other than secret destruction of his property. If I was your boyfriend I would be furious."
"My personal experience is that when you have a really strong feeling of 'missing out' and it makes you want to take drastic action, it's more than just a feeling, it's a real understanding that deep down this isn't the relationship you want to be in for the rest of your life."
"&gt; The ""I'll never cook for you ever again in my life"" response is a telling sign that he does not have good conflict resolution skills. 

Yup. This is a person you can't have an honest conversation with or call out for anything or he takes it to the nuclear level (""you're being rude and taking over my house/taking my stuff"" ""I WILL NEVAH COOK FOR YOU AGAIN, UNGRATEFUL WOMAN!""). The whole thing about how most men don't do that, as if she should be grateful that he's stinking up her kitchen and making a mess with a meal she doesn't even like — he's ridiculous. He doesn't get a points for being willing to cook, he's a grown up. He's trying to make her feel like she is the one in the wrong for having the nerve to speak up and address an issue that is bothering her. Bad sign. 

I also don't believe he forgot she didn't like the meal. I do most of the cooking at our house (because I enjoy it and because my husband and I are both honest about the fact that of the two of us, I'm by far the better cook). There have been a couple times where I've made something and he wasn't a fan (and I agreed with him) and it's rare enough that it stands out and I remember what he does/doesn't like. He just wanted to use her kitchen because it's probably bigger than his and that way he didn't have to stink up his own home. And then he can play the victim when she says she doesn't like it. I also don't see how you eat a sandwich your SO specifically made for herself ""by accident"" (why would someone make a sandwich and put it in the fridge if they weren't planning to eat it later? the ingredients didn't just magically assemble themselves). 

I think he sounds like an inconsiderate jerk who's trying to play the victim."
If he can't walk he needs to burn calories **somehow.**
"Have you had any counseling to deal with your dysfunctional family and its effect on you?  It's difficult to see how any contact with them could be good for you.  

You seem to have a reasonably good life where you are with some support (baby shower friends) so why would you want to re-enmesh yourself in relationships that only work with substance abuse.

Get yourself into counseling and minimize contact with people who do not enhance your life."
"This is bad advice. She had no obligation to tell him about her other job offers, especially since it was never really an option. She knew she was taking the dream job. She doesn’t need to regain any trust, he needs to respect her decision and act like a rational adult."
"Personally, I would NEVER trust this person. Not because of the cheating years ago, but because of her attitude to cheating now. 

She thinks that as long as you don't find out, it is not a problem. So the cheating is fine, it's the ""finding out"" part of it that is damaging in her eyes. Also, she doesn't think that cheating on your wife is something that reflects on your character, so she's a ""surface friend"" - she doesn't care about a person's personality, she cares about the good times with that person. This makes me think she is incapable of the kind of an attachment that you seem to be looking for. She has a good time, she does what she wants, when she wants it, and if that breaks her relationship up, too bad. She just moves on. She is willing to risk everything over whatever her impulse is at any given time. And your feelings are collateral damage. They aren't even a consideration at the time she is making a decision to act. And she doesn't think that a person has a right to make an informed decision to be with a partner, so she really doesn't care that there's a woman out there who sleeps with a man whom she would probably never let touch her again, if she knew what he is up to. 

At least that is what I myself have observed about the people who were wired the way your girlfriend is wired. They are too selfish, and if you're not as selfish as they are, you WILL get your feelings hurt. And you know What? It will be your own fault. Because she's not hiding this fact."
"&gt; It's good when it's good I guess

Yes, that's how abusive relationships work. Actually, often the good parts are *amazing*. Words like 'you're an incredibly special kind of person' and 'there's no one like you', and 'you're simply amazing' and so on. Love-bombing. Always right at the start and then regular as clockwork after one of the shitty periods.

And the shitty periods are *always* because of something you've done. They're never the abuser's fault. Ever. 

But they might be so, so sorry after they've done something crappy. 'Look at what you made me do' is the abuser's mantra.

And there's always the pattern where things are gradually, gradually getting worse, and there will be a time when your abuser objects to this, that, the other person being in your life. The good parts get less good, and further apart. The shitty parts happen more and more over less and less and get worse and worse.

The only way to fix this is to get out, and the longer it lasts, the harder it is, and the more dangerous this gets.

This guy is your own personal heroin fix.  The good parts are the high, but normal relationships *do not have* the 'crash' part, the regular comedown, or a 'walking on eggshells' feeling. That 'walking on eggshells' feeling ('he could get 'set off' at any moment') is how you know for *sure* the relationship is harming you, like addictive drugs harm you."

"honestly your OP and him refusing to see a therapist (classic dude 'tude btw. he needs one and is afraid) read to me as immaturity on your husband's part. the fact that he thinks it's ok to have this level of expectations of you while you are *heavily pregnant and more or less incapacitated* speaks to a serious lack of awareness on his part. he's not really prioritizing you or your comfort, when a fully supportive partner would put you front and center given your condition. instead, he's prioritizing himself and his need for your attention. 

the most generous assumption i have is that he's very anxious about his new situation and is acting out in this way instead of communicating to you (the former being childish, the latter being the healthy, mature thing to).

I think you need to have a serious conversation with him about what's going on. Hopefully you will open his eyes to how he's behaving. If not, you may have a bigger problem on your hands. "

"You two don’t sound like you are sexually compatible and, You should definitely not get engaged to someone if you are not compatible sexually. It’s a huge red flag that she wants you to  propose but, she isn’t willing to work on the sexual part of your relationship. It should be important to the *both of you* not just you. Sex isn’t just about sex in a relationship and, marriage. It’s about intimacy. You want to be emotionally and physically intimate with your future wife. If she can’t provide that intimacy to you then you may need to rethink the relationship. 

To answer your question: *yes it is a big deal* and, *yes it is a red flag*. I wouldn’t propose or get engaged to this girl who would throw you an ultimatum like this.

I see this with my own close friend and it is heartbreaking. She wanted a baby, hubby kind of didn't but didn't say ""no"", they didn't use BC and she got pregnant. Now the baby is close to 2 years old, and my friend's marriage is dead. She just lives with her baby daddy as a single Mom. He MAYBE holds his baby once a week or so, so Mom can get a 5 minute shower. And that's it. The rest of the time he is at work or playing video games, and stomping and pouting because he never wanted his life to change and he didn't expect a baby to be so demanding and pull his wife's attention away from pleasing him all the time.

I wish there were better education about having kids, so people would be forced to stop and think before just shrugging and having a baby, and then AFTER pregnancy / birth saying ""Wait, I didn't expect THIS!"" "

I guess I need to look at ways of managing my emotions now because I don't want to keep having the same conversation and not being able to let go."
"Unfortunately I think you need to accept that Alice creates drama. There is absolutely no reason overhearing that conversation between Bob and Roy should have caused her to treat you differently. Further, while she may be mad at Bob for comparing them to you or essentially saying you seem like a better partner than her, Roy and Bob have also been friends a long time and that seems like it should be a safe thing to share. You didn't get looped into Bob's marital discord, Bob said something nice and was vulnerable with his friend - that's it. 

Do not make any changes to your plans and don't treat her or Bob any differently. If she creates drama, so be it. It sounds like she's already known for this somewhat. Be friendly and kind, keep your cool, and let her actions speak for themselves. "
"&gt;She has a best friend Nick

&gt;she told me I need to accept her relationship with Nick because he means a lot to her

&gt;Their relationship was purely sexual

OK, these three things are not compatible, and I think I know which one is the lie. Of course their relationship wasn't purely sexual, if it was, she'd have exactly 0 reason to keep him in her life if they're not having sex. But this isn't a purely sexual exchange, it's a close friendship with lots of sex, which sounds an awful lot like a relationship, doesn't it?

I'm curious why they aren't dating. If it's because Nick never wanted to commit to her, I wouldn't stay in the relationship. To me, that situation would mean that your GF wanted Nick the whole time, and still does, which is why he's the first dealbreaker in all of her relationships.

But frankly, even if that's not the case, I wouldn't stay with her. If I'm going to bother dating a girl, I need to be the #1 in her life, not her 'best friend' who also happens to be a long-term sex partner. "
"He can wear them if he wants sure, but he has to understand that if he is making them a package deal with him, people who don’t want the socks can just reject that whole package... including you. They make you uncomfortable, unattracted to him and moreover his defensive attitude makes you confused and like he doesn’t trust you or your opinion. If he doesn’t care what you think of him, why is he in a relationship with you? 

You guys are a team and right now he is choosing socks over you(r comfort and peace of mind)."
This is such good advice. I didn't learn until I was older than love isn't enough. It's not enough to make any relationship successful.

I worked there every summer from 18-23 but whilst it was allowed, generally it was assumed that firstly you'd regularly check on your students no matter what, just little ""is everything ok"" for tests to helping out with ideas or just getting students to explain things so the could help develop their ideas. 

It's your duty to be proactive. You're going for valedictorian so I assume you'd have an idea that you cannot just be passive. I'm sure she meant ""I have no specific instructions but do your rounds and chill in between"", you're old enough to not need constant instruction especially since you've been in classrooms most of your life. "
"The question you need to address is WHY have you been lying?  What is it about your home life that is driving you to be less than truthful to your SO in the first place?

It seems like there's a breakdown in communication between you two, and that needs to be worked out first.  If you don't have trust AND communication, then there's not a lot going for this relationship going forward."
But it was wise to sleep with her casually? 
Thank you for this.  All these replies are really helping me come to terms with what just happened.
"Well it may be too late now, but yes confront her. This is a serious betrayal. It is not okay, and is actually considered an abusive action (reproductive coercion). It's definitely a reevaluate the relationship, get outside help via counseling issue at least."

"He lies like a rug and is trying to turn the conversation to your questioning so he doesn't have to admit it. Stop apologizing, stop explaining. When you revisit this sober, answer him with, ""That's right. It's awful that I asked that. Now, what else are you lying about?"" and don't let him change the subject."
"He will NOT turn to you. If he is having trouble bonding with you as his mother, pulling SIL away from him will actually make him feel even MORE averse to you because you have taken the woman who cared for him away in an attempt to force a relationship. In fact, he will actually probably grow to hate you."
"You're SIL is an outstanding person.  She was there for your son every time you failed him.

&gt;It just upsets me because I feel like my whole relationship with son was poisoned by her from the very beginning, like she intentionally wanted to take him away from me because she couldn't have kids and now she succeeded.

Nah, actually it all comes down to the fact that you're a terrible mother, deflecting every instances when you dropped the ball; blaming your own issues on others, never taking any responsibility for your own mistakes, never realising it takes two to build a relationship with a child... you're in total denial of the abuse you inflict on your family.

I a few years your son should check r/raisedbynarcissist 

&gt;(who was 23 at the time... and they started dating when she was 15... so a little creepy)

A useless information to this post just to defame your SIL. There's no mental illness to blame, **you're simply not a good person**. "
"Actually, as another person said, leading by example is much more powerful than with words. And healthier, actually, a lot of the time. "
"But R wasn't just some rando hitting on her. R was a longtime good friend of her husband, and she'd only had good experiences with him before this stuff started. Even leaving out social conditioning (which is also significant here because it tells women that they're being full of themselves if they assume that a guy who's clearly trying to fuck them is actually trying to fuck them before he outright expresses an interest), it's understandable that OP didn't want to jump straight to accusing her husband's longtime bff of coming onto her over things that, initially and on their own (before the X-rated gifs), seemed relatively harmless or could conceivably be written off as coincidences or jokes or compliments. OP had reason to want to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, and before he crossed into egregious sexual come-ons, it's pretty reasonable to think that her husband would've as well. 

It's easy to say that OP should've handled this differently in hindsight, but think about this honestly. If your wife came to you and said that she thought that one of your best friends was coming onto her because he kept sitting on the same couch as her or because he sent her a message complimenting on her on a low-cut top, would your first assumption really be that he was trying to seduce her? "
So i had this same thing but with a baby shower. None of my close friends showed up but random acquaintances did. I am now closer wth them 🤗
Yeah it’s the phrase “I’m going to ignore you” that stands out here. Super childish to put it this way. There’s nothing wrong with saying “I need some space” or something but this comes off like he’s punishing a toddler.
"This. I could get the bitter disappointment until he **demeaned and disrespected his partner, showing his ego and entitlement.** He literally said she *isn't deserving* and is *""less qualified""*.

**Huge huge huge red flags.** Plus instead of talking about or processing it first, he straight quit his job like a child with a temper tantrum. I bet the boss is glad he didn't give the boyfriend the job - **with his behavior, clearly the more deserving and qualified person got the job.**"
"&gt; My statements are about the difference between, say, walking into a Botanica in San Diego or LA and walking into a Metaphysical Bookstore in a nice, white suburb in the midwest.

i'm honestly cracking up about this because unless you've seen the stark difference and know the difference in how the practices present, it's not going to make a lot of sense to someone. 

i literally walked through a shop in colorado today that had expansive shelves on wicca and europagan stuff, homemade incense packets with rip-off names from a popular hoodoo shop, and one teeny, tiny shelf with a few lucky mojo publications and a few outdated texts on santeria. (their herb selection was perfection, tho)."
"&gt; First of all, your boyfriend was sexually assaulted. Too drunk to consent+passively received is pretty unambiguously sexual assault. He was coerced and misled, the whole nine yards.

Yep. his ex made plans to sexually assault him, then she did."
"Yea, she quit her gym and trainer after a week and continues to order Uber Eats (most likely unhealthy food). To blame those decisions on outside factors or genetics, is arguing that his wife has no free will and all her decisions have been predetermined by genetics and outside factors. Then it becomes a philosophical question of whether humans have free will at all, and if not then what is the point of all this? How are we different from scripted NPCs in a video game? Are we all just in a VR game where Elon Musk is the actual main player controlled by an advanced species and we’re all just AI programmed by an advanced society of coders?"
"Yeah, I know what sacrifices he did to be my dad, I know how much he loves me and my brother, he never put my brother above me, even though he’s his biological kid.

He’s always been my dad, always will. I’m very fortunate, and I love my family, I know how fortunate I am."
Ugh my freshman year roommate did this to me too. She and her boyfriend started having fucking anal and she was crying because it really hurt and that woke me up. I told them to stop because i had an early class and needed to sleep- they were like “oh yeah sure so sorry!” And kept fucking. Not even quieter. It was hell and I feel for you. 
"She told you in front of people!?? Oh, that’s it, she’s just a monster. I’m afraid it’s probably just time to let her go. I’m sorry. "
"I think she used you as a bit of a rebound mate. Dating you 1 day after a 3 year relationship does not give one time to reflect. I think this  trip may have reminded her of the single life and she may be pulling away to do that. This is the worse case scenario besides her cheating on you but I don't know that.

 I would explain how your feeling and that you feel that shes being distant towards you and ask her is everything alright see what she says if she get defensive or annoyed something is going on. Keep in mind it might be her not feeling the relationship or anything or whatever if she says nothing and continues to act the same I would split because you cant be second guessing everything in a relationship. with this being said   this could be just her not feeling very well or the honeymoon phase could be warring idk you would have to ask and hope you get an honest reply. Hope it works out for you but if it don't theres plenty more fish in the sea :)"
"Yeah but it wasn’t the one she ordered, so what the quantity *she* received instead was *hers*.

Meltdown was not appropriate but perhaps it’s boiling over from previous experiences. Did all four of you agree to this decision? Or did the three of you decide not to let her have it for some reason against her wishes? 

I can see that pissing her off, especially if she had problems with you guys in the past. "
"Unless she gives you a lenghty apology on her own volition, I don't think this friendship is worth your effort. What a lack of empathy on her part."
"&gt; How farther along in the relationship should I be before I bring the subject up again? I'm assuming that I should first start with a similar question like, ""What are your sexual fantasies"", and then a couple of days later ask her to let me go down on her, or do dry humping or naked cuddling, something that could satisfy me temporarily.

OK, hold up. ""Something that could satisfy me temporarily""?!? Sorry, do you view sex with your girlfriend as a tool for your own sexual gratification?

How about taking things at a pace *you're both comfortable with*, and letting things progress naturally? Creating your own sexual timetable (purely in your own mind) that involves pushing her to let you do things to ""satisfy you temporarily"", is a very messed up way of thinking about the situation - especially considering that you think she's inexperienced in this area.

&gt; Is there a length of time that's acceptable for me to wait for these various different sexual activities without looking like I'm impatient or only care about sex?

Well that's certainly how you're coming across here.

Take things *one step at a time*. The ""bases"" metaphor might be crude, but it works in the sense that it (a) creates a natural flow of sexual progression in a relationship, and (b) allows *either* partner to slow or halt that progression when they start to feel uncomfortable (in a healthy, safe, mature relationship, that is).

And if sex is such a high priority for you that you feel the need for ""temporary sexual satisfaction"" after dating someone for *just over two weeks*, then I suggest finding a partner with an equally high libido, instead of pressuring someone you suspect ""barely even thinks about sex"" to meet your timelines."
"Bingo. Exactly what I thought after reading this. He settled for her as a stop gap between girls he feels are attractive enough for him. Ex girlfriend is back in the picture and he's pulling the old ""be mean and nasty so she breaks up with me"" routine to pretend like hes not the bad guy that broke up with her. Hes a selfish coward who is also cruel, dump him.  "
"This feels like the kind of post that shouldn’t be on the internet.  

EDIT: I don’t think you should call the police. I think you should break up with your partner and get away without ever mentioning that you saw this."
"He didn't handle it well though in my opinion.

I kept telling him the reason and he kept asking why over and over. Same with his computer. He asked why I would go through his history in a way where I admitted to it or something and I'd have to say again and agaub that I didn't do that. It's as if he doesn't listen to me when he asks me things. Like literally doesn't listen. And now it's been 6 hours and he either hasn't talked to me or would snap at me when I would even as so much express that I'm getting upset. 

And I have talked to the bff about this and she said what a commentor said above. He sucks. It honestly is embarrassing having to be like ""oh so um when you say I can come over for some wine - Please don't invite the boys because Dan will get mad."" we have used the ""it's just a girls night"" to the boys many times but i can tell too much of that is annoying bff because she wants to see all of us, and sometimes i haven't gone out to fun things like axe throwing because the boys will be there and I know I ""wouldn't be allowed to go"" without Dan getting pissed.

And I also have invited dan out before and he says no. That I've probably said bad things about him and that they all hate him. "
Dump this loser and lose weight for yourself. 
Do your wife a favour and divorce her. She can do so much better than you.
"You have succesfully escaped being drugged, raped or kidnapped. Congratulations.

Report him to the police. Prevent him doing this to other people.

I have used tinder for 2 years now, on and off. This is not typical behavior, this is not acceptable. This is VERY SERIOUS. Report him to the police asap.

He probably used a fake name, that's why you cant find him on social media anywhere. DO NOT GO OUT WITH HIM AGAIN.

Please be safe.

Edit: can/cant typo"
Yeah. You sadly have an idea of what he is capable of. 
"It creeps me out that she uses ""no sex for a week"" as punishment. She should be fucking you because she's horny, not because she wants to reward you. And no kissing? Intimacy is not a fucking bargaining chip.

Maybe she's not a golddigger and it just bothered her that you're planning for the potential end of the relationship. Still, there are some red flags here. "
"You are not overreacting. He is doing something behind your back. Does that mean he’ll sleep with someone else? Maybe not, but he sure isn’t staying away from that possibility, 

Edit: he didn’t cheat in the traditional sense and it is up to you to determine what cheating is to you. Personally, I’d leave if he couldn’t do as much as tell the truth. "
How in hell is this going to help anything 
Rarely ever is it a choice. It's completely laughable that you think it is an actual choice for most women.
"Oh really? Because your parents don't seem inclined to extend you or your wife the same sort of concern or consideration. They're willing to hammer down your door and scream threats to get what they want, and the hell with how it affects you or your wife.       

You obviously wish that everyone could just get along and play nicely together, but that's not the situation you're in. And the people who've put you in it are your parents. All your wife did was put in place a perfectly reasonable boundary after having a child via a c-section. Your parents are the ones throwing dictatorial tantrums, stomping boundaries, and generally acting like spoiled brats. That makes it all the more imperative that you stand united with your wife and learn new ways to set and enforce boundaries with your parents. The process won't be comfortable or easy for you, but it is absolutely necessary if your marriage is going to survive.       "
"Your immunity is shot to hell after you give birth, especially after a Cesarean. She already has to worry about her own body failing her (mastitis and urological infections are very common and very serious issues), she shouldn't have to concern herself with other people's germs. Four weeks isolation is not unreasonable to ask."
"Haha, someone who constantly tells you that you look tired or sick does not have good intentions. That’s super rude.

Next time she says something, reply with, “Excuse me?” or “That’s not a nice thing to say” or “Wow.” Do not reply. 

Could she be upset that you took so much time off? Taking off “at least one day a week” is *a lot*. I assume she had to cover for you. That would be really annoying for a lot of people, even though you had a legit health issue."
You support her dreams by lowering her self esteem? Some brother you are. 
"Dude, you are 21  and live in the age of the Internet. I simply refuse to believe that you never googled average penis size and checked with a ruler.  If you really had a micropenis, you'd know by now.

She's just saying ANYTHING however ludicrous to annoy and hurt you. Don't let her win.

Now go get a ruler, read Wikipedia's page on ""Human penis size"", and reassure yourself."
"I feel like there's something else going on and she's taking it out on you... My first instinct is that it's her *fiancé* that isn't excited enough about the wedding and instead of yelling at him, she's yelling at you. If this has been a rewarding and positive friendship over the years maybe sit down with her and give her a chance to tell you what's going on. 

It could obviously be that your friend is showing her true bridezilla colours, and if that's the case, there shouldn't be any question about dropping her. 

It's also not at all OK for her to treat you like this. But if it's a brand new behaviour I'd probably take the time to try and figure it out "
"&gt;Will I ever stop being paranoid

I mean is it paranoid? The two times you checked he was in fact being skeezy. 


&gt;I just want my fucking trust issues to go the fuck away


Well he's not helping.


It's not over the line to ask your husband to stop pointing out other girls.. "
"Thirded, and it's something I glossed over on first read. Even though OP's an introvert, he still has social needs(obviously, since he's feeling lonely) - if he makes a few friends to help satisfy them, his wife should feel less guilty about spending time with *her* friends.

Her WoW addiction is still a problem that needs to be solved, but OP should consider going to some Meetup groups or something so he has a social outlet that doesn't involve his wife. Even having some mutual friends with his wife would help, but I'd be concerned it'd turn into a ""he's just tagging along on my outings with my friends"" thing if he's that introverted and not putting in effort to arrange social things himself.

Being someone's sole source of social support is super stressful."
"I’m a shift worker and this made me so so mad! It is so hard to sleep during the day at the best of times, add to that the stress of being awake during the day when you know you should be sleeping cause you’re so tired. Part of being a shift worker requires your family and friends to be supportive: staying quiet through the day and not disturbing you. He is definitely disturbing you by altering the very few variables you have in place to allow for a good rest so you can operate like a normal human being."
This statistic of over half of marriages ending in divorce is actually no longer true. And it was never true of first marriages. 
"Honestly if you really loved her, you would admit to yourself that your marriage is over and she deserves someone who puts her first. 

At a critical point when she needed you, you failed and made it about yourself. And here you are making it again about yourself. 

Just give her the divorce papers, apologize what you put her through and then continue to work on yourself. "

"&gt;He says he doesn’t know why he did it and he’s ashamed of it. 

He's being fundamentally dishonest. He intended to be unfaithful to you. The only reason why it didn't happen was because he was turned down. Telling you he doesn't know why he did it would suggest that he'll do it again. He won't know why next time either, no doubt.

&gt;It’s hard for others to tell me what to do as they don’t know about our relationship. 

On the contrary, the relationship seems quite clear to me. You've only been with him around a year, and he couldn't even be faithful to you in that period. "
"Not Japanese but lived/worked/dated in Japan for several years, but it sounds more like he is taking his duty as ""host"" of his country and culture very seriously, and he feels a duty to present the best image of Japan to you, especially if you've never been before. That said, Japanese men are not the best communicators, and with the stereotype of Western women as more aggressive ""go-getters"" compared to Japanese women, he might be unsure how to proceed over some significant cultural barriers. 

Now that you're living on the other side of Japan now, has he been receptive to visiting you or you visiting him? Maybe test the waters with a proposed visit around White Day, or send homemade chocolates like /u/Bytemite suggested and wait for a response. This way, he's not put on the spot, and he doesn't feel the need to ""save face"" and say something he doesn't feel to avoid hurting your feelings. Regardless, if it ends up not working out the way you'd hope, you can still plead cultural miscommunication and maintain your friendship. "
"Don't be petty or go for the dramatic. Try and make as clean and ending as you can so you can stop wasting time and move on. The best way to hurt someone is to treat them like they don't matter to you, like they are a transparent window and have no power over you or your feelings. "

""" She was one who would manipulate and physically abuse her children for attention. Even though he is very successful man, it still plays a toll on him whenever he sees a grown woman cry. He gets very angry and snaps. ""

If he is unable to see a woman cry without it triggering anger in him, that's something needs to work through in therapy. With his issues and your PTSD, you two just aren't compatible. You need someone who will react to you crying like a normal person, and he can't be that person. "

"I’m American, father Hispanic, and I’m Catholic. My American culture says the body isn’t as important as my Hispanic culture and religion does.

I still wouldn’t tell my mom I lost my dad’s ashes (which, actually, cremating him caused a rift in the Hispanic side of my family) or tell her they were lost by someone else. 

It would just hurt her a lot when there’s no need. 

But I’m saying, American culture doesn’t really revere the body as some others do, certainly. "
But you do know not to yell at people feeding their 5 day old infant in their own house hopefully.
"I assume you're American, as most people on Reddit, and I know you guys have a different approach to nudity and I try to respect that (I'm European). But personally I'm really baffled by the word choice here.. 'disgusting'? How can a boob be.. disgusting? Even more: how is a mother feeding a baby 'gross'? As I said, I don't want to judge what might be a cultural difference but to me his reaction is kind of disturbing: a grown man that considers a woman feeding a child 'disgusting' has some obvious issues and I would never even consider hanging out with him.
Anyway, congrats on your babygirl! &lt;3

"Get a lawyer asap.

She's already cheating on you.

Open relationships are really bad for most men. It's difficult as a married man to find women who want casual sex. Even women who are into casual sex would rather hook up with single men who can give them lots of attention.

She won't have any problems. There's literally a never ending supply of men that will be happy to pump a load into your wife then send her home for you to take care of.

Basically whether you agree to an open relationship or not you're going to be spending a lot of weekend nights alone while she's with other men. Or you can get a divorce while still in the prime of your life, get joint custody and find a new woman that wants monogamy like you. Dating for men is a ton of work either way, better to put in that work for one good woman (since that's what you want) than trying to get the type of nasty girls that will be happy being your side chick."
"Well, yeah. :-/

I don't think he should allow her in his place without supervision and that's a fact."
Seems like a very manipulative and terrible person
This is indicative of a much larger issue. It’s not about the rice. He had zero reason to be such a rude loser. I’d put a lock on the fridge for a couple days and tell him he’s lost privileges so you felt perhaps a time out like a toddler will help him understand not to do that again. Since he’s clearly not an adult. 
"Why should OP be the one to buy new containers when he’s already furnished most of the kitchen?

"I suspect that the story Jeff told you about his firing is *highly* skewed. You see how he’s behaving toward your GF and your GF’s friends... and how he never admits that he’s wrong... 

I don’t think that women are safe around Jeff, and as a result, I don’t think it’s smart to be friends with him anymore. Yes, he has a lot of issues. And yes, I’m sure he’s a ‘good guy’ at his core. But that doesn’t change the fact that his behavior toward women is unhinged and frightening and his behavior as a friend (to you, a guy), isn’t great either."
Why would she prioritize getting married to a guy who can’t afford to travel?  (/s?  Not quite sarcasm but more than a little snark)

Are there any, like, hamburger commercials that advertise how many burgers are an appropriate engagement gift? "
Yeah that also bothered me greatly. They search for her for 8 months and not once did the brother say he knew where she was. They didn't even know if she was alive. And then to tell the grieving family that she is better off dead shows a serious lack of empathy.

"All of my close friends were shocked when I finally told them about what our relationship was really like, and ended up feeling bad they didn’t know- but I hid it so well! 

He used to randomly spank me so hard it left red marks, and tell me I liked it when I said it hurt and asked him to stop. He’d randomly bite me, too, saying the same- he couldn’t help it because I looked so good, and that I liked it. He’d get frustrated at our animals and occasionally throw them across the room if they woke him up, and had kicked them a few times. He once teamed up with the dog and chased our skittish cat around the house for 10 minutes until he got so terrified he peed. He’d be upset if I woke up before him and didn’t stay in bed and cuddle him/scratch his back, or if I made too much noise while he was sleeping.  He got annoyed if I went to the gym 3 nights a week claiming I wasn’t spending enough time with him, but refused to come with me. He never hung out with my friends, but would get upset if I didn’t hang out with his. 

After leaving him and finally telling my friends about what our relationship was really like, my friend told me: “ if you ever feel like you can’t tell your friends about how your SO treats you, it’s probably abusive” and she’s right. 

You can do this. Leaving him has been the second best thing I’ve done for myself, right behind getting the therapy that helped me realize how messed up our relationship was to begin with. "
"&gt;You should never force a dog to come to you to abuse it.

Not to mention that it's almost inevitable that the dog will stop coming to the boyfriend at all when he's called...then the boyfriend will get even *angrier* and perceive this as the poor dog deliberately ignoring him! Or worse, the dog keeps going, and gets punished every time :( The poor thing can't win. "
"Do they have any specific objections to you going to the PRC? I'm not a fan of a lot of things the PRC does, but from a personal safety standpoint it's a safer place to be an American than America."

"MDMA has negative side effects 2-3 days after you roll -- your body has a lot less serotonin in it so you tend to be more depressed/irritable/etc. On the flip side, when you actually roll, MDMA floods your body with serotonin, giving you extreme confidence to do things that you would otherwise be afraid to do.

So it's possible that the roll made her realise that she wants to end your relationship. Or it's possible that it's the comedown speaking.

But I wouldn't read into that, honestly. I think you guys are becoming two different people. Your GF enjoys drugs, you don't. She wants the freedom to do so, whereas your personal values and career needs require that you stay away from it. You guys are in long distance, which can feel naturally isolating and constraining. I think you're discovering an important, fundamental values clash that will have ended the relationship one way or another."

I can get over the one instance just fine, but to literally tell me to my face that he would willingly put me in danger again is completely unacceptable in my opinion.  Is that really an overreaction on my part?"
"I don’t know why Reddit wouldn’t be happy about that. You’re not saying smart women never want to be stay at home moms. You’re saying generally women who invest in formal higher education don’t do it and then give up all that work to be a stay at home mom. 

And you’re right. I didn’t spend 7 years after high school going to more school and then take and pass the bar exam to plan to stop working if I have kids. If I wanted to be a SAHM I probably would have only gone to college. 

That’s not to say there aren’t some women out there with graduate degrees who would choose to stop working and be a SAHM. There are, I am sure. It’s just going to be a minority. "
Then your reaction would have been creepy. And you also seem shitty calling other kids weird. Now you have two adjectives to be offended over.
"I feel like a younger me wrote this. As the ex-girlfriend of someone also in the military, it was always ""weird"" when he came home. We got so used to the distance and talking over text/phone/skype that we didn't really  know how to act once we were finally together. We did have some fun, but eventually we just started fighting all the time. The military does change some people, and eventually my then-boyfriend just started caring about his job more than his girlfriend who lived 2,000 miles away, when just a year before he wanted me to marry him and move down to his base (but I said no because I was 18.) I also never thought I would find someone who loved me as fiercely as he did ""he had to love me because he wanted to marry me right??"" is how I used to think. Now I'm 23 and in love once again. I promise you will not be the same person next year, the year after, etc., you might realize that LDR's aren't for you, you might realize that being a military girlfriend/wife isn't the kind of life you want (like I did), but honestly, it sounds like you need to move on. Being miserable when you're together is definitely not how a young couple like you guys should feel. "
"I am so curious what hair sweeping back like a forty year old looks like.

This is not a guy you should be buying a house with. Sounds like he is a teenager and you are the mom, but with no consequences. So make some, don't fix his life so he doesn't learn. "
I don't want to steal the cat. I would only do that in a severe abuse situation. 
"You did the right thing and he's responding like a teenager. Ignore it. If your GF stands beside you on the issue and doesn't coddle him for being truant, than you've got nothing to worry about.

If the back talk, looks, and rude behavior continues past a few days, then ask his mother to do something about it."
"I agree with what you did. And I agree with your reasoning for it. But

&gt; My mother has told me she's beyond disappointed in me and that I have lost her trust. I tried explaining my prospective on the situation 

What did you explain to her? Was it just like how you wrote here? Because I can see how she would have been hurt.

You knew your little brother was living in a house with the new woman and you had a hunch (""Personally, I didn't feel comfortable being the bearer of bad news and telling her myself"") that your mom didn't know. While it was never your job to tell her - your dad should have - it would have been nice if you did, when the new woman moved in. Because that's when it started involving your brother's living arrangements and it became your mom's business to know. 

Sure it was the easy way out to not tell your mom, but you have to agree you prioritized your comfort over something really important to your mom's life, of course she is hurt. 

Did you apologize for not telling her? 

Did you empathize that you are angry that your dad didn't tell her, that she's absolutely right she deserved to know?

Side note - how did she not find this out from your little brother? Does she just like, not talk to him at all about his life? "
"First of all, don’t ever reach back out to him for closure. You won’t get what you want. What you want is for him to acknowledge that what he did was hurtful / disrespectful / selfish, &amp; it’s not likely that he’s going to be like, “Yeah, I agree, let me say all the things you want to hear from me.” It’ll just make it hurt more when the discussion doesn’t go the way you’ve planned it to go. 

Second, it sucks for you that this came seemingly out of nowhere, but it’s probably something your ex was thinking about for a while. So for him, it had context &amp; wasn’t a surprise, but you weren’t prepared to have the conversation because you didn’t know it was coming. 

It sounds like, even when you weren’t on holiday, you were still somewhat long distance since you were two hours away. So when he was talking about the distance, it is likely that he also meant that he couldn’t see you regularly, even when you weren’t away. Unless you had a plan in place for one of you to relocate, that’s not something that would have changed in the near future. 

It also sounds like he was interested in this other woman, who lives in his area, so he wanted to break up when he did in order to move forward with her without cheating on you. If we were advising him on what to do, we would probably tell him that it’s better to break up via phone than to wait until you traveled to him just to break up with you, &amp; also to break up before anything constituting cheating could happen. 

I don’t think any of this is what you’re looking to hear, but the thing is that no one here can give you that. If you want people to tell you that your ex was a selfish asshole, then have some wine with girlfriends &amp; air out your grievances. But if you want to move forward, you need to accept that it’s shitty that you felt blindsided but that the relationship was not going to work, anyway, &amp; that breaking up on your four year anniversary / in-person reunion probably wouldn’t have felt any better. "
"If that was the case I feel like the roommate would've responded to the texts or came out when he knocked on her door saying ""Hey, wasn't me, sorry!""

This sounds like roommate is afraid of confrontation or something of the sort and has a problem with him using the heating."
How on earth would he find out if they replace the ashes?
"I think it's that he is an in-law and the 'hobby pianist' using/maintaining it, vs his wife who is family but... doesn't play?

I'm hoping it's not because of male primogeniture that discounts OP's wife being part of the family because she's female. xD"
"Geez, he asked your sister's owner, and then she had to go and be a ""person"" with her own ""brain"" or whatever! RUDE!

Sarcasm, obviously. This guy is an asshole, and your other friends might be, too. Thank goodness she said no, if this is the entitlement level on this jerk. Dump him, give your sister a cupcake."
You’re ignoring every thing people are telling you. Why did you post if you aren’t open minded? It’s not healthy that a 29 year old guy needs you to drink on a weeknight. It doesn’t bode well. PAY ATTENTION to red flags! This is a red flag!
How do i go about this though? I know this sounds bad but all this pressure is the reason I don't want sex so it's a cycle
"&gt; If Amy doesn’t hear my mom knock, and my mom walks in on it.

There’s a really easy solution: they call or text to see if Amy is working before they come over or come in. As do you if you are bringing a friend over.

Amy is working from home. If that took the form of typing in the living room fully clothed, would you be nearly so concerned? Would you be more on Amy’s side? If so, perhaps you concern is with the nature of Amy’s work.

And that’s leaving aside the issue of a grown ass man allowing his limited mobility mother to do his cooking and cleaning.

Given your resistance to budging an inch on this and your resistance to every suggested workaround, maybe you should move out."
"I mean could you not just pick one and have them become a friend with benefits? Why do you need to fuck the whole social circle? Not only does that mean that if shit *does* go south and it doesn't remain casual you'd be losing many friends instead of few, it also means that you're going to be known as the person getting passed around (whether that mentality is right or wrong, it's how it is) by this group of people. You're no longer ""one of the friends"" and instead become ""the person sleeping with the group."" 

Sleeping together generally changes friendships unless the entire friendship has always been based around sex. I'd say find *a* friend with benefits, not every single one of them."
"Well the other comments are half right. Mismatched sex drives are definitely a relationship killer. 

BUT the OP said something that clued me in that makes me think it’s not her fault. She said something along the lines of. 

&gt; I feel this pressure to perform. 

This to me says she feels more like she’s unprepared or put on the spot. Pressure to perform is not saying “no” to the act. It’s saying she feels uncomfortable with how they are approaching it. If she truly had low libido, I think we would see different language used. 

I think OP’s boyfriend just got a little lazy with the relationship. He is trying to take shortcuts to sex, and he’s skipping the parts that she loves most. He can easily course correct if he starts showing her that love is more than just sex. "
Music schools don't teach students to repair or tune pianos.  They teach students to perform.   Music schools hire tuners and repairmen just like anybody else.
This is what happens when you date someone who is still in high school.
"It's really up to her to decide what risk she's willing to take. 

You need to stress how important it is that she stays closeted over there, but if she's made up her mind to go, there is not much you can do to stop her. "

"Was it worth it? 

Probably not.

I’d suggest you take the initiative and attend some financial literacy/budgeting classes. That might help him feel like he hasn’t just made the biggest mistake of his life. 

If a dream wedding is more important to you than a successful marriage you will only end up with a dream divorce. "
"&gt; I suspect their shitty management of money is why OP is how she is as well

has to be a factor, yes."
You should add this to the original post. The fact that Dawn is using several bedrooms as hers exclusively basically undercuts any arguement she might have for splitting things 4 ways. 
"Sure, but do you actually earn money? OP's BF is 'working from home' on a personal project that earns precisely $0 so I'm not sure he is being realistic about what he ""needs"" when he's literally just doing what he feels like every day."
This is the correct answer!
"I didn't do it to feel good, I did it because I (and every girl I know) has been in that situation  and there's usually nobody around to help. This was the second bat we were at, it's not like it took up the entire night. I get him feeling frustrated but other than not checking with him first I don't think I did anything wrong"
"&gt; you’re a misogynist.

I...do you know what that word means?"
"Yes, the more I think about it, I think my main issue is that he's calling it ""rent."" I'd be happy to start contributing since we'll soon be a TEAM. If he's having trouble making ends meet this month, then just tell me that. Maybe it's a pride thing on his end. In any case, my goal is to have a constructive conversation with him tonight. "
"About your age, I did something similar.  It kills me to admit this publicly but I need own up to it.

What I did was exactly what others have said.
I QUIT DRINKING, I KEPT NOT DRINKING FOR A WHILE

Step 2- 
You need to evaluate how you feel about the life you lead too.  I realized that because I was angry at my life and at ex, and because I was sooooo immature that I couldn't verbalize how I felt, when I drank I became mean. 


I think you need to consider some counseling.  You need to deal with the underlying anger, resentment,  that is underlying the aggression you have.  You are also drinking to get away from something in there.   I know that from experience too


I did all of this in 2010-2011, and I was able to actually begin drinking again, and started having a relationship by 2013-2016 where even drank together with no issues. We separated by 2017, but by then this past of mine was a distance memory


But quit drinking and start dealing "
"Are you dating my boyfriend? The 'forgetful and messy' you and the tidying up with a smile - that hits close to home.  

Honestly I've just started telling him exactly what I want and when I want it. Is it the most romantic thing in the world? No, but neither is him taking out the trash and recycling for the 30th time in a row and he doesn't complain about that.  

I will give him a list of things I want to pick from, tell him which of those are amazon prime and which will take longer.  

Ya know what? I get some really amazing gifts now! For Valentine's day I got a set of ""he's a catch/she's a keeper' mugs, for christmas I got some yarn and a purse I wanted (and he actually did surprise me with a chromebook - totally spoiled).  

I would say to him ""Hey, my birthday is next week, I'd like you to write me a letter for it"" or ""Here's the jacket I want for christmas, you need to order it by the 22nd"". And yeah, it'd be nicer if he did it without prompting, but I guarantee if *they* were talking about *us* they too would have a list of things they'd prefer we did without prompting. And honestly I'd rather be me than him - I have to deal with his forgetfulness a few times a year and he has to deal with taking out the recycling *forever*. "
