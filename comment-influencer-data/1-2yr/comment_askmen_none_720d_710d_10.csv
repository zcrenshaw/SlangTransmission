I'm not giving up trade secrets.
There's nothing weaker than someone who can't ever accept they were wrong.
I get tired of informing women what it really means.
Don't apologize just to end an uncomfortable situation if you aren't in the wrong. THAT makes you look weak.
"Was drinking at a New Year's party, holding my own bottle of champagne, leaning against a wall having a breather.

Up walks the girl I've been crushing on for a year and softly grabs my neck and gives me the most lucious, open mouth kiss, then walks away. 

After I finished reeling, I realized my champagne was missing. 

Worth it. "
Quick glances when she isn't looking. It's an art.
"She slipped her number into my back pocket. I didn't know what she was doing, only felt a hand on my ass. She walked away immediately, and when I looked at the paper, my boner grew three sizes, that day."
"Invited her home for some balcony red wine. She appears with dinner she wants to make for both of us. I think cool. She asks if I have eggs. I say yes but we're making a fish thing, do you need eggs for that? She says ""No for breakfast.""

Mind blown. "
"It's just another word for ""condescending"" which is an attribute that is not exclusive to men."
"I try not to take for granted that even my most ordinary, boring days still include someone caring about what I did, wanting to share in my successes and failures, sharing a meal, Netflix, and some hugs, and just overall thinking I'm the best."
"I'm a straight guy who can see other guys as attractive without it doing anything for me sexually like ""Yeah, that's a good lookin dude. I'd probably let him stuff my meat cave if I were a girl.""

So maybe it's like that. The understanding is there just not the sexual arousal/interest."
Go trampolining next and see if he looks then. 
"She points at my phone ""Is that the new one? Have you used (appname) yet?"" I say no, she says another one, again - no. ""What about MyNumber?"" I say I don't have that one. She takes my phone puts her number in - there now you have my number."
"Had this conversation with my buddy a few months ago.  Both he and his boyfriend agree, ""Boobs are pretty.  They just don't do anything for me sexually."""
"Call me old-fashioned, but I like to see a girl twerk her *soul*."
"I'm in my first serious relationship at age 28. The hardest thing has been dealing with the added weight of commitment that comes with age...combined with the uncertainty of not knowing what I want due to lack of experience. 

The woman I'm seeing, like many other women my age, has already had numerous relationships. She knows what she wants in a guy. What mutual love feels like. What she wants in a relationship, and for her future. Many are ready &amp; looking to settle down in the next few years. 

I on the other hand, really have no idea what a good relationship should be like or feel like. All I've known is the casual sex and uncommitted flings of my past.  I don't know whats a deal breaker for a partner and whats not. I don't know how to love mutually...or if my feelings are genuine enough to keep things going. I'm just figuring out what being a boyfriend even means. 

And its tough, because I feel like I missed my window for no-pressure exploration of all of this. The decision to call a woman my girlfriend feels massive. Like I need to choose someone I could see as my future bride right now rather than just someone I want to share my life with right now.  

I know if I stay with this girl long term and it doesn't work out, we'll have both ""wasted"" the last years of both of our 20s. Its especially hard knowing that it could be my fault due to my uncertainty &amp; inexperience.  So it makes me focus a lot on her negatives, rather than her positives....Sometimes I feel I'm almost searching for an excuse to break up sooner than later. Or hope she'll break up with me. I feel like the love I have now isn't good enough or strong enough.

I think the most surprising/positive thing about being in a relationship is how accepting she is of my faults and inexperience. I always thought I'd have so much I'd have to hide from a future girlfriend if she'd ever want to stay with me....personal issues, concerns about myself, concerns about her, about our relationship. And I did keep a lot of it to myself at first. But I slowly realized no matter how open I was with her...she just wanted to support me and work through it."
"This has got to be the most askmen question I've ever seen. And I love it.

"
"Sucka, I'm 30 and still don't have this shit figured out."
I would like to speak to an attorney.
"""It's not you, it's me"" is just a way of softening a dumping. In reality, most break-ups are nobody's fault. Sometimes people don't click, and that's just life.

Blaming someone for who they are or aren't attracted to is stupid and entitled behaviour."
"I ask a girl out just one time and anything other than a YES! is a no. Not really into playing this game of trying to convince someone to give me a shot. But then again... i dont typically ask out complete strangers. if i meet someone at a bar let's say, i typically have a decently long conversation with her before asking for her number to go out for drinks. "
There is no thought. She doesn't like you. Move on
"I went out to lunch with some coworkers and was texting my girlfriend, mentioned where we were in passing (she's in another city a few hours away). Ask for the check, it's already paid, I'm looking around to see if I know anyone in the restaurant... Nope GF had called in and paid for lunch. "
[removed]
Or look at anything besides him in the entire two hours?
"I was talking to a girl. As in, I was at work, she was waiting for a ride, I walked up and said hey. Then spoke about nothing for a minute. 

She goes, ""So, do you want my number? Here"" and boom"
"So like what like, 2, maybe 2.5 inches? "
What of hers is so smooth? Was her head bald aswell?
"You don't. You go to hr and have them do it. It's not your job, and most jobs have grooming standards. "
"* ""What does kissing feel like?""
* ""I got invited to a party at college, how do I accept?""
* ""I'm sick of all the relationship questions, men what is your favourite type of bacon?""
* ""Why are men so intimidated by an attractive woman who speaks her mind?"""
Obviously he strategically timed it with your blinks so you wouldn't see him looking.
"Random lady got me to do shots with her at a bar. It was turn for tequila she was explaining to her friend how to do it. She just gave out commands while we were doing it. Lick the salt! Take the shot! Bite the lime! Kiss! I remember kissing her I was thinking "" wait what?!"" So that was smooth. "
She's just not that into you?
"Shes slow fading me, time to move on"
"Also, weak people worry about whether or not they look weak."
"I shave my head.  One time I was at a bar talking to a girl and she starts rubbing my head talking about how she loves how smooth it is, then she leans in and says ""your head is so smooth...*just like something of mine.*""  "
"There's no right answer to this, but there is a wrong one: if you expect your SO to put more into fitness than you do yourself, then you're an asshole.  I hope everyone in this sub who expects their women to stay ""fit"", better also do the same for themselves.  So many fatass beer belly guys think they have the right to tell string beans to stay in shape."
"If you want a gendered term that means ""spoken down to in a particularly masculine way"" we already have the word ""patronizing""

Mansplain is just a sexist way of saying ""you don't get to correct me"""
Because it's simulating riding your dick in the best way possible
"If they cancel once without a reason or without rescheduling, I stop pursuing. That's just rude. "
I mean I like ass...
I used to be like you. Then my wife jokingly did it in front of me naked. It drove me bananas. 
The champagne was an acceptable sacrifice.
Or blink.
It was her vagina.  
It's time to stop
"""Can you drive with one hand?""

Yeah.

*Holds my hand*

Daaaaw"
We have a turd in the punch bowl.
"So this is super smooth and all, but also a total douche move. She knew you had a crush on her and she just used that to steal your champagne.

I see how it's not a big deal, and how it was worth it, but that's a shitty thing to do."
"I ate a bowl of nails for breakfast.


*Without any almond milk.*"
"When I was younger I was a fucking fiend for jerking off. 6 to 10 times a day was normal. I eventually got desensitized I think and I needed more. I started off trying to fuck my pillows, a mattress, a vcr slot. None of that worked and one left a scar. 

Then one day I was eating a hot pocket. And it dawned on me. I let it cool to a warm but comfortable temperature, and fucked it.  Amazing. 

My mom was shocked at my sudden taste for hot pockets. The problem was I couldn’t eat them afterwards. So she thinks I’m eating two hot pockets for every meal of the day, meanwhile I’m starving, sneaking snacks out of the pantry at every opportunity. 

It was an amazing summer. I spent every cent I got from mowing lawns on hot pockets. BBQ beef was the best because of its consistent texture. 

Oh, I left out an important piece, I had to break them up afterwards and flush them down the toilet. So 8 times a day I was mashing up hot pockets filled with jizz into a soup like consistency and flushing it down the toilet, like some kind of psycho. 

That was a long time ago and I’m over it, I have a fleshlight now anyways and it’s much cheaper to buy diced ham and cheez wiz in bulk "
"I did things to make my own life better, and stopped chasing girls. One day, on the #2 bus, there she was. I talked with her, but didn't want to be a creep and ask for her number. Kicked myself in the ass for 2 weeks. Then, a second time on the #2 bus, there she was again. I asked her out for coffee. We've been married for 9 months. 

Edit (for clarity): When I first saw her, there was this shady dude hitting on her, and she couldn't have been less interested - nose buried in a book, headphones on. When he left, she immediately shoved her headphones and book into a bag with some force. I laughed out loud, she took notice, and asked about my shirt. ""Is that Chuck Palahniuk?"" It was a homemade shirt that read, ""You are not special."""

I go to the gym regularly about 5 times a week and eagerly wait for my gym crush to show up. Its been 3 months since I've last seen her. i'm afraid she's gone forever now :(
"It mostly goes into the sewers/gutters via the shower or when I wash my hands, so ninja turtles maybe!"
Is your girlfriend single?
I feel like he might've looked when we were about to leave and he stood up and over me for a few seconds before I joined him and we shared a hug
Because ass
"I was single from 29 to 33.

I just wasn't interested in the game anymore and spent years doing things for me.

Apparently a guy who's spent years saving money, enjoying the gym, decorating his house and having adventures is more attractive than a bar rat.

Do you, and either they'll come or you'll be happy anyway because you looked after you."
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

It's a stereotype that Indian people smell bad.  I have no idea if it's based on food or bathing or what but it's just one of those things.  Because that stereotype exists bringing up the issue suddenly gets professionally dangerous.

"My girlfriend has a particular talent for almost imperceptibly turning cuddle and conversation into more. One minute we'll be talking work or history or what we're having for breakfast, the next, her hands wander and I just boarded to train to Fuckville making station stops at Handjob Depot and Blowjob Junction.

She's like a horny ninja."
That's not even smooth. That's some shit only women can say cause we just wanna fuck lmaooo.
Not sure if this qualifies as smooth or borderline trashy. Either way I like it.
"What a peculiar question.

"We hooked up for a while then parted ways. 

The only girl I've ever hung out with where it felt completely mutual"
"I'm currently sat on the other side of your situation, almost to a tee. While it sucks a little... It's not so bad.

My boyfriend is 27. I'm his first girlfriend; first girl he's been involved with at all, actually, whereas I'm a ""veteran"" of a couple serious relationships. I'm not him, but I might be able to contribute to this discussion.

The best parts have been doing the ""firsts"" with him. Sex was wonderful. His first trip to Europe. His first evening in, cuddling and holding hands. Because it's all fresh and new, he approaches it with all the enthusiasm and passion of someone who's wanted to do all this but never has.

The downsides... My expectations have had to be quietly realigned.
At 28, I really am ready to get engaged in the next couple years, but it will be *several* years - if ever - before my partner is going to be ready to be thinking marriage. Hell, he might never make a commitment like that to his *first ever* partner. Usually dating in your mid-late twenties has this unspoken undertone of ""we're both looking for someone to potentially settle down with if this works"". He isn't, and that is sometimes very hard to live with."
"When i say ""its not you,its me"", it means that i am not that attracted to you and i cant see myself with you so i don't want to prolong this relationship anymore because it would be unfair to you. You deserve somebody better than me, someone who actually wants to be with you for you. and i also want to be with somebody that i really wanna be with. "
"I catch myself looking sometimes, but not because I'm attracted to them. Some of them can be interesting to look at for a bit.

Same with a woman's butt.

 But a dude's butt? That's good stuff."
"Yeah... If she means no when saying it, then the no is accepted as it should be. If it was an attempt to play hard to get, I have better things to do than decipher vague signals. "
"I'm 25 and single, and I'd say that 90% of the people I know are in the same boat. That said, I'm in NYC. Where I'm from (in the South), I'd say around 60-70% are paired up at this point. You've got time and 'taking whatever you can get' is a horrible idea. Better to spend more time finding 'the one' and enjoying that than settling out of desperation and suffering for it later."
"A quote I commonly find myself saying is ""I'm not mad you broke up with me. I'm mad that you decided to be a bitch about it.""

If I got broken up with ""I'm sorry, but after the first round of interviews we've decided to pursue more qualified penises"" I would actually be okay with it."
"One time I was smoking weed with a bunch of friends.  Late teens maybe. Some years ago. And we were doing that cool smoking trick where two people form a tunnel with their hands intertwined and blow smoke thru it.
    
Up next was me and this girl. We intertwine our right hands together but then she pulls mine down and goes for a kiss. While kissing she blows the smoke into my mouth. I was pretty shocked and cool with it at the same time. Realizing what had just happend while exhaling the smoke. Heh I forget that happend. Pretty smooth but we never got serious.                           "
"The sizes were exponential, so I was up to 1.5 inches! It was boner-riffic!"

Always take responsibility for your own actions. And giving someone an apology isn't something that makes you look weak it will make you long strong. Since you have the courage to admit you were wrong.
"A big one that single guys don't understand about getting married is that you aren't raising the bar in expectations for your relationship, you're lowering it, a lot. Many guys are intimidated by marriage because they think that they'll suddenly have to be a more mature and responsible person, to fit the husband mold more perfectly. Like after you get married then there's no more keg parties or dance clubs in favor of couples night or wine and cheese parties. 

That is the opposite of the truth. When you get married, that person is agreeing to marry YOU. Not some version of you that you must become to please them. They're committing to staying with you, in all your goofy and weird glory.

"The good: if both partners are committed to a successful fulfilling relationship, there is nothing better in the world than waking up next to your life partner.


The bad: sometimes single friends feel cut off and rejected by a married buddy. It is often blamed on the spouse, but the harsh truth is that sometimes a married person needs to leave behind the single life, and sometimes friends who are still partying and going to the club are left behind.


The indifferent: grocery store runs. I no longer live in Spaghetti-Os, Totino's pizza, and Hot Pockets."

"For each other, there is always somebody there to listen, to bounce ideas off of, to help lift that thing. I almost never come home to an empty house, and I love that. It sucked being single and coming home from work every day to just my cat."
"&gt;I was being myself and we just had a lot of things to talk about and not once did we have an awkward silence.

That is excellent. 

Have you kissed her? If not, do that on/after date #3. I'd hold off on the girlfriend conversation for now. You're still getting to know each other and it doesn't sound like things have progressed a lot, physically speaking. 

&gt;how do i even ask her out?

You're already dating her, dude. I think you can chill about the particulars of how you ask her out. She seems to like your company. Think of some fun activity and ask if she'd like to go with you.

"This happened at my office. Had a female colleague, D, whose stench permeated throughout the whole floor - Seats over 20 colleagues. On my first day of the job when I walked into the office, it felt like my nostrils were getting clogged up and my mind went, ""Sh*t! Is this my life now?!"" Went on for a good couple of months and colleagues who sat close to her did not dare to mention a single thing. One chose to hang an air freshener in her cubicle instead.

Eventually, one ballsy colleague, L, pulled her aside for a heart-to-heart talk and told her that she's only mentioning this for her own good. She said that most of us found her armpits very strong smelling and that she might want to try putting on some deodorant. D broke down in tears because she had *no* idea that she smells!

It's improved significantly but if D comes in close proximity or by the end of the day, you might still be able to smell it albeit faintly... Not sure if this would be the step you'd choose to take but let's hope that if you do decide to tell him, he'd take it in a good way and appreciate it."

"You should cut back. You don't need them to ""unwind,"" you like the feeling of being tipsy. Plenty of people unwind from work by, well, not being at work anymore and enjoying that time at home. 

You're setting a bad precedent here. If you need 3 drinks a day to handle regular life, what happens when life gets *really* stressful? Do you start having 8 drinks a day? Then what happens when shit hits the fan during that period? A bottle of liquor a day?

As someone who works in a hospital that specializes in vascular issues: alcoholism will kill your blood vessels. Aortic aneurysms, esophageal varicose veins (that rupture,) bleeding gastric ulcers, along with your regular liver failure (that fucks with your blood clotting mechanisms, which isn't great when you've already got that gastric ulcer.) Not to mention withdrawal issues, shakes at the most mild, seizures at the worst. Ever heard of delirium tremens? Doesn't seem like a risk until you land yourself somewhere where you can't drink for a while and suddenly you're in them after quitting cold turkey. Hepatic encephalopathy will also ruin your brain.

These are all consequences of longterm alcoholism. I'm not saying you're there yet. But you're setting yourself up for that possibility. I've had 19 year old patients with alcohol induced pancreatitis even. Everyone is different, and alcohol affects all people differently, but habitually using alcohol as an emotional crutch makes you rely on alcohol for life, not just enjoying it once in a while for fun. 

I full expect downvotes, but the medical consequences are real despite how mainstream alcohol use is. All things in moderation; every day is not moderation. "

The gay one said he loved them! He said they're fun to play with, and he would often used my chest as a pillow, but they did nothing for him sexually. The bi one said that they're okay but kinda weird and he didn't actually like them all that much (keep in mind we were 17 at the time, his opinions may have changed in the past 5 years.) Whenever I gave him hugs he would often literally just start laughing because he felt mildly uncomfortable with my boobs pressed up against him.

Everyone else wanted to turn back but she wanted to keep walking, and to convince me to come with her, she said quietly to me ""there might be something in it for you"".

Then when we were about 30 seconds in front of everyone else, we turned a corner and entered a tunnel thing where we were out of sight of the group, and she stopped, turned to me, said ""c'mere"", put her hand on my neck, and kissed me passionately until she saw one of our friends turn the corner. She was super giggly the rest of the night and kinda poured her heart out, saying all these sweet things about me.

She knew I liked her, and she was a ""all her guy friends are always in love with her"" level of attractive, so it really felt like it came out of nowhere, because I had always assumed she'd never be into me.

It's a long story where things went from there though.

Edit - Where Things Went From There, since you guys asked:

We started talking a lot after that, texting back and forth a ton over the next week or so, her still being super sweet and me making her laugh, until about a week after kissing me, she gave me a whole ""so I meant everything I said, and I still really really like you, but I'm a shitty person right now and I would end up hurting you and you deserve better than that"" speech. Kinda crushing, but I get it. We slowly started talking less and less (her move, I sort of went with the flow and took the hint that she didn't want to keep talking), and eventually we had stopped talking completely.

Then a few months after that, she started talking to me again. (In hindsight, the cynical part of me sees it as patronizing, like: ""I have decided to bless you with my attention once more!"") I still had a ton of feelings for her, and it seemed like she still felt the same about me, so I was pretty psyched. From there, we talked more and more, and more and more intensely. She was getting *really* into me, and I was getting really into her. I know, it sounds kinda silly when it was largely over text, but we would text all day, and you should've seen some of the things she said to me... ([I might delete this later, but here are some of the things she said](https://i.imgur.com/DzYlKpD.png))

Anyway, at the height of things, this happened on my birthday: we were texting on my birthday, and we used to play this game where we'd say a word and the other person responds with the first thing that comes to mind, and then sends a word back. I had said my name during the game, during the first month or so that we were talking, and she had said ""that's not fair!!"" and she didn't give me her answer, so she said she'd tell me later. On my birthday, she told me her answer was something she read once that said: ""do you ever wonder if you were in a room with all the people you've ever loved, whose arms would you run into?""

From there, we talked about ""us"" and mutually decided (I thought) to at least try dating, or at least getting a coffee to talk about it. Then a few days before we were supposed to go out, she bailed because of a school assignment or something. Then...that happened again, a couple more times, and I started to get the feeling it wasn't assignments holding her back. She started drifting on me, and getting really cold, until eventually she stopped talking to me altogether right before Christmas, and when I confronted her to ask what happened and why she was ignoring me like that, she sort of gave me the whole ""I'm still shitty and I'd still hurt you if we dated and I'm still not in a good place to be in a relationship right now"" speech. That stung. Took me a long time to move on. I found out later that she started dating someone else like a month later, for a year.

Then this summer, like a year and a half after the kiss in the tunnel, we hooked up at a party, right before both of us started new jobs. We talked for a bit but then she went quiet on me, (there's more that happened here but this is already pretty long). Now I've moved across the country. The last time I saw her was 2 days before I left. She wanted to take me out for dinner before I left."
"I might entertain it for a bit.   

If she's really that insecure, this isn't going to last.  
Meanwhile, I have a lot of porn-search fantasies ...   if she wants to play ""you don't need porn, you've got me"" - I'm gonna need to see that whole collection,  from schoolgirl to naughty librarian, with a few tentacles here and there.   
"
"Don't try to take your mind off it. You gotta mourn, man. "
"bullshit excuse term to shut down any point, discussion, even conversation without having to put effort or thought onto any counter point or thought"
"Girls completely ignore you if there's a more attractive guy around. Like literally, I'll be standing next to my friend, and girls will go up to him and introduce themselves to him without once making eye contact with me. "
"Female here, I have asked a close gay friend of mine. I asked him this he adamantly said he hates them."
"It means a person of the masculine gender who is nondescript; ""That man's plain"". Some men emulate this look as an anti-fashion statement."
"It wasn't an ex, but someone whom I had feelings for and they didn't reciprocate.

It's a gradual process.

I find this quote somewhat relevant to how the whole moving on process happened:

&gt;“There is nothing that can take the pain away. But eventually you will find a way to live with it. There will be nightmares. And every day when you wake up, it will be the first thing you think about. Until one day, it will be the second thing.”

That's what happened - it became the second thing on my mind.

What helped or changed? Idk. Mostly time and stuff. "
Went on a date. We were walking after and was debating holding hands but she ended up making the move and it was so smoooth. Ended up a pretty good night.
"&gt;Where it felt completely mutual

Yep, ouchie for me"
Are you talking about colonialism?

"straight female - I do this too! At the beach one time this girl walked by and I felt the need to be like ""babe. look at her abs. and her butt. and her boobs! my god she looks great!"" I wouldn't want to ever like... touch any of that though, but I can definitely admire a nice body when i see one"
I think that's just called being a fuckwit 
This one was stealthy
"After an entire date of not looking, this would have been such a great line from him as a proposal for a second date.  

""I was thinking, maybe, trampolining?"""
that speaking confidently and courteously to women goes WAY further than not talking to them at all. 
"I realize you're tired, but can you please mansplain it to me? "
"I mean..it's word to describe how condescending men can be when talking to women especially in a professional environment. In my field (computer science, mostly younger people) I'd say it's common and more often unintentional.

Its just a word for calling attention to one of the many issues women can still sometimes face today"
"I told a girl she was talking too much.

She said ""why don't you put something in my mouth to shut me up?"""
"is it smooth to say ""btw, ima suck ya dick""?"
"I have a policy I used on the last few GF's that worked very well, because the truth is, girls, and in general, people, will get curious and their trust may falter due to some signals that you don't know you're sending.  We just live in a reality where even the most kind, trustworthy seeming people can be shitbags, that's just the way it is.  The distrust is sometimes understandable, especially in a new relationship.

I haven't had anyone who was overly obsessed with looking through my stuff, but when that subject ever comes up, I tell them this:

""I will allow you to go through my phone ONE TIME in this relationship, you can do it now, or you can do it later, but I give you ONE shot to look through and settle your fears and see that you have absolutely nothing to worry about, but then you can never bring it up again.""

Works.  Most of the time they don't even care to look through anymore.  It's not right - privacy and trust are pillars of any relationship, but if you have nothing to hide, maybe it's better to just satisfy them once and move on."
You there. Shush
Blowjobs are awesome and involve sucking omg lol
"I'm also a straight dude and I find it pretty damn hot. It's literally a jiggling, sparingly dressed ass. Perfect."
"Modern engine oils work well enough right from ignition, just don't rev the bollocks off it while driving until it's warmed up. Drive normally and it'll be fine."
"That's a pretty major breach of privacy, I'd be mad.

She'll probably be pretty disappointed that she sabotaged trust just to find out that my RockAuto order has shipped and I have a new eBill from the electric company."
I understand what the term is trying to convey. But it's used incorrectly so often that it's meaningless. It's become a catch all for any time a man tells a woman something. 
I see you're a man of culture as well.
"She's currently cooking dinner and walked over to me with a jar and the lid was stuck on tight, and I opened that badboy in one go, so that."
"Having a desire to be physically intimate with their partner. Not sex, but smaller things like getting miffed about not having their hand held, or taking their SO's hand and placing on their back because they like the way they rub their back. Asking for a kiss etc. "
"I was waking up next to her for the first time and thought ""I want to wake up to that every morning"". "
"You mean there’s still hope? 27, been single all of my life."
"Tbh, I'm actually more attracted to women who put an effort to stay in shape. She doesn't have to be a fitness freak but a couch potato is not my cup of tea either. "
"There used to be a girl that I trained(BJJ) with in the gym. She is slender and very gentle. I would roll/spar with her regularly. Once, she went for a very unusual choke but, it was smooth, accurate, and very tight. I had to fight my way out of it with every thing I had. I realized that her style of rolling/sparring is similar to hunting with one bullet. To a guy who outweighs her by 30lbs and is stronger, she will only go for a submission if she thinks she can get it. When she does go for it, there is a reason."
"I've developed narratives for all the regulars at the gym.

Please tell me I'm not the only one who's done this."
'Hard to get' just means 'Hard to Want.'
Daaaaaaaamn
A big one that goes both ways. Women have a lot more intimacy with their friends and talk about their problems and shit. Men misplace this as romantic interest when women confide in them. Women misplace this as friendship and don't have the perspective to realize that men generally don't do this with anyone but their closest friends.
Having never been hit on or complimented in a flirtatious way 
"Same, my last relationship was that way. I was always the one making plans. She seemed excited to see me, but I just didn't feel like I was a priority to her. I was a convenience to enjoy when time allocated to it, but everything else in her life came above her. "
Well then I'm glad I could take this one for the team.  
“Now listen here you fucking curry muncher...”
I'm now imagining someone timing a glance to blinks...
"I was working at a bookstore years &amp; years ago. There was Taschen's ""Big Book Of Butts"" in the window. I was having a smoke outside &amp; she was flirting with me (I'm not very good at flirting). She asks me what my favorite book that we had in was &amp; I sarcastically said ""The Big Book Of Butts"". She smiled, turned around, bent over, lifted her dress up and asked how hers held up. Instant love!"
"Former landlord. Most I ever spent to turn an apartment was after a very polite Indian couple moved out. Carpet and pad gone. Painting was a nightmare. Vertical blinds gone (as in cheaper to replace than attempt to clean). Bleach and Odoban all over. Even the fiberglass bathtub needed a specialist to get out the small, let alone the stains."
"Damn it, I come to this site for laughs, not sadness and feeling lonely.

Seriously though, that sounds like pure joy."
It's like helping someone clean out their teeth with your tongue.
Well? How did it go?
"I was &gt;so&lt; lonely.  I missed my kids a lot, I was broke, life was bad.  As grey and hollow as anything could be.  

She popped up kind of randomly.  Was mostly awesome.  Super smart.  Interesting.  Fearless.  Really amazing boobs.  

Probably too good for me.  But... something was going wrong, and I couldn't figure it out.  She kept assuming I was crappy in ways that I wasn't.  She thought I was sneaking around on her, I wasn't.  She assumed I was making fun of her, I didn't.  She kept jumping to conclusions about me that I was very negative and hurtful.  But not leaving.  Somehow, she was ok with it.  She thought I was a jerk, and she was ok with it.  

I wasn't a jerk, I wasn't ok with it.  I can guess what was going on, but I don't know.  I do know that the wreckage of my previous marriage loomed over me.  ""If it's not right, don't chase it.""  

I had put a lot of effort into keeping my horrible marriage going.  I resolved to never do that again.  

I walked away from a person way better than me.  Because I didn't want to be their bad guy and couldn't figure out why they wanted me to be that.  

Its sucked, but I think I made the right choice.

"Met a girl who's a Harry Potter fan while travelling. Was walking along a beach at midnight in Italy, most romantic setting possible. We come across a 4 poster bed, canopy and everything, on the beach. She says ""it's like the Room of Requirement or something"" and I was done for"

"As long as I've sat here scrolling through the front page, this is the first one I come to with no comments.

No married guys read reddit? Well that's not true.

I'd assume the best I can offer is that marriage really is a great thing if you're both in it for the right reasons. I serve my wife and she serves me. It's a mutual partnership with amazing rewards of close friendship and always having someone to hang out with.

I think single guys also think that waking up next to the same woman every morning would get boring quick. Couldn't be further from the truth. She knows what I like and I know what she likes. It's good sex every time."

She was a really cool girl. Always doing little things like that.

Later on in our relationship she would call me over to help her reach something then say thanks, you were too far away before a make out session or just straight to a blowjob.

Very cool girl."
Ask her why she's so insecure.
"On the outside: ""Thank you!""

On the inside: ""What the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"""
"That's why you start early with the depression, so it doesn't sneak up on you during working life."
"Couple theories I have. 



One, is they're bored, and going on a date sounds like a reasonable way to fill a night. Then something better comes up, and eh, fuck that internet stranger.

"As a gay dude, im not sexually attracted to them. Its like theyre just there.. hanging. When I think of them or see huge ones, i think of cow udders.

"Yes! And I started working out because running was no longer painful so I lost a lot of weight and gained so much confidence, especially because I finally could find clothes that fit without choking me! So many good things came out of it. Honestly, the reduction was without a doubt the best decision I have ever made. 

If there are any women out there reading this who are considering getting a reduction, please feel free to ask me questions or PM me! I am more than happy to share my experience!

"From an AskReddit thread, ""What are some of your worst/funniest gym experiences?"":

&gt; A pretty overweight dude was running at full speed on a treadmill when he lost his footing, slipped, and the treadmill pretty much shot him right off of there.
&gt; 
&gt; But where it really gets good is how he recovered. He was on* one of the back treadmills that's just in front of the mats where people do ab workouts. 
&gt; 
&gt; He landed in such a way that he was pretty much laying perfectly on the mat. So instead of getting up, he just sort of started [doing crunches](http://i.imgur.com/H3uvj.gif) like nothing even happened. So much win.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Maybe those ""crunches"" was just him trying to get up. 

&gt;Oh I feel so* bad for laughing at this.

&gt;&gt;Definitely don't feel bad. Virtually all treadmill rockets are comedy gold. 

&gt;Don't. Fat dude here, we sorta wanna laugh at our own failure as well.

&gt;&gt;This is one of those moments we need a time machine for. I want to see a fat man get flung off of a treadmill and just start doing crunches!

&gt;He did a good 20 crunches too. One for each of the fucks he did not give."
"I agree fully with you here. Really, I think that it's unreasonable to expect anything in a partner that you don't offer - income level, fitness, dressing decently, etc. It's fine to want an in-shape, well off, educated, attractive partner if you yourself offer that, too. "
"Look, we have years and years of experience when it comes to this. OF COURSE we notice your cleavage, it's the first thing we notice. But I don't drool like a retarded person over them because, well, it makes me look retarded."

"ha.  
  
This is extremely petty but this made me think of this guy I have discussions with often on a gaming subreddit I frequent. He can NOT admit when he's wrong in a conversation, or even come to an ""agree to disagree"". He HAS to be right.  
  
Again, I acknowledge entirely this is petty thing to be reminded of when reading this but man, it's been a crazy past week or so in that sub and he damn near stalks my comments to stir shit up.

This. Such a shitty feeling.
"&gt; You have all the frivolous sex you want

You have *vastly* overestimated the experience of being single."
"I've had men condescendingly explain my own job to me.  
  
I had a male mechanic condescendingly explain a very simple concept relating to driving a manual, basically trying to blame me for a bad transmission by saying that I probably don't downshift to accelerate (I do because I'm not stupid).  
  
I've had many men try to make me feel stupid in an attempt to flirt with me, by choosing a topic, asking me my thoughts on it, and then correcting me (instead of having a well-meant debate, which I'm always down for).  
  
I had a man condescendingly explain that my hemorrhagic miscarriage (read: pain on par with labor contractions and dangerous amounts of blood gushing from my vagina following 12 weeks of pregnancy) was just a heavy period and his daughter gets those sometimes.   
  
I'm human, and I'm prone to error, but there is a difference between correcting someone when they're wrong, and assuming they're wrong without actually knowing so.  
  
Of course I've had women speak to me condescendingly at times. Women in bureaucracy are especially prone to this.  
  
But it's far more common and usually more detrimental when I've experienced it from men. It's not just ""you should have filled out this form, ma'am"" at the DMV, it's ""your life-threatening condition isn't real so I won't call the duty driver to take you to the ER"" and ""You're responsible for your failed transmission because you probably can't drive properly"".  
   
I'm not talking about issues here and there. I'm talking about a *pattern of behavior*.  

One of those funny things about sexism is that we can all agree it happens on both sides, and we don't need to get overly offended about it. Calling attention to an issue that largely affects women doesn't automatically negate issues that affect men.   
  
That all said, I think that words like ""mansplaining"" and ""'manspreading"" are needlessly inflammatory and grammatically stupid. I think that it makes some men more prone to automatically reject any mention of sexist behavior as fake and made up, and I think it makes some women more prone to call any shitty behavior sexist. "
"This x1000.

There are billions of people in the world, finding ""the one"" is a nonsense Idea, but when you factor in that you that you need to find someone who is a) of your preferred gender

b) who you're attracted to, who is 

c) attracted to you, who

d) has a personality that meshes with yours, who 

e) has similar life-goals

It narrows the number down a huge amount. 

It's ridiculous to expect that every date you go on will turn into a relationship, even if you date someone for a couple of weeks it might not work out as you get to know each other.

I usually avoid ""it's not, it's me"" and try to indicate what I'm feeling ""I'm not feeling the chemistry between us"" or whatever it may be, but 100% of the time if I reject someone, it's not that there is something *wrong* with them, it's just that they aren't a good match for me, and that's nobody's fault and there's nothing anyone can do to fix that."
My preference would be for her to ask me out. Then I can either turn down or accept the date and she can get some closure one way or another. I'd want her to make a move so that she can stop pining after me if I'm not into her or we can actually do something about our feelings if they're mutual.

Won't go into why we broke up after 1.5 years, but I met my ex by moving across the country for a new job. I'd just turned 29, single for basically a decade. She was my flatmate and we just instantly clicked.

I was nervous about being a gamer, not many friends etc.  She was in to gaming too and we just fell for each other.  I believed nobody woumd want a slightly overweight lone wolf like me.

Turns out I was wrong.  She's far more attractive and skinnier than me too so I lucked out massively there."
"&gt;""I didn't want to post, but after having a couple glasses of wine I will. I agree with you, I wish I would could take back the decision to have our little girl. She has down syndrome and the first 5 years everyone supported us, family and friends, we were so courageous. Then it started going down hill, the amount of care insane and when no one wants to help it gets worse. We felt like a burden to everyone and pretty soon we weren't invited to parties or over to see family. Just the major holidays, and it starts taking a toll. I had to quit my job to take care of our daughter, my husband has two jobs, I never see him anymore, we are rarely intimate, I gained a lot of weight, my life is ruined. I cry a lot when I'm home alone with her, and I started drinking to numb the pain. My husband hasnt said it, but I know he want to leave, the love is gone. I recently found out he was cheating on me with another woman, but I can't get a divorce because I can't support my little girl in my own.
If I had one thing to say to any other woman out there, unless you're rich, it's better to abort the pregnancy if you know.
I had a friend who found out she was going to have a down syndrome kid, I told her not to do it, and I drove her to get the abortion. That day was so emotional because I had to bring my daughter along. She didn't tell the husband, and we made up a story that she had a miscarriage. A year or so later they had a beautiful healthy baby boy.
I can't write anymore, I'm crying so much...I wish I never had her...and I hope one day I wake up to find she died in her sleep. Sometimes I even think of letting go of her hand so she can run into oncoming traffic. I would never do it, but this is real, it's not fun, and it will ruin your life.
When people ask me how things are going, I always lie, always. Everything is great, we are doing so good, she is a blessing.""

"1. Being broke, jobless, a commitment-phobe and other things that are generally listed as ""deal breakers"" in dating can actually help you if you're just looking for casual sex.

2. That there are a significant amount of women out there who don't enjoy receiving oral sex. And before someone says ""well you must not be doing it *right* then"" typically these women will stop you as soon as you start moving your head down there.

I like looking at women. It revs my engine but doesn't fuel my tank... or something clever.
"Not all men like booty, not all men like overtly sexual moves/acts/women, not all men like that type of aggressive display.

My SO is a boob man. I'm an ass girl. I love twerking when the girl has a shapely and larger shaped behind that she moves well. He couldn't care less. It's a little aggressive for him. But boobs of natural sizes on thinner women make him go nuts."
"Save some pussy for the rest of us, yeah? "
"women dude, not even once. ive had some be genuinely into the conversation, down to meet, and everything seems great and then with no warning its just a ""sorry cant make it tonight"" and nothing else. i leave without a second thought but its just so fucking odd"
"It's cool when she goes slow, it's absolutely terrifying when she goes full speed."
I didn't say they were in a relationship or seriously dating. But going out on successful dates with someone (with the reasonable expectation of having more dates with them) *is* dating.
This exactly. One thing I've realized is most girls have multiple guys vying for their attention. It's happened to me and pretty much means I've been put to the back of the line. 
"Start with ""I'm not racist but..."""
"me: I don't.             

If I find a girl attractive enough to have regular sex and we get along well enough to keep atleast a fwb thing going: I would catch feelings.           

That's why I don't do this kind of arrangements anymore. Not satisfying for me. "

"My first was at 30, she was 27 and suffered from BPD and dated a new guy every week. I was her first long term boyfriend in a long time and I let her in way to deep way too early in the relationship. Withing two months she went from wanting to have my baby to telling me I reminded her of her abusive father. Breaking up with her was one of the hardest and sanest things I've ever done. 

Lesson here is that it may seem like a good idea to move fast to make up for time lost, but its not. Take your time to make mistakes and grow from them, learn to spot red flags, or you may end up in a seriously dysfunctional situation.  "
"I was working at an arcade at the time.  My shift was almost over, and this one came in and asked for an application.  For the record, I was 19 and she was 18 at the time.  I gave her one, and she went and sat on a bench.

After my shift was over, I was leaving and she came up to me.  She pushed a piece of paper in my pocket saying ""I changed my mind, but you can still have  this."". I pulled the paper out, and it was her name and phone number off the application."
"Ohh you've unlocked some memories I haven't had in ages. Before I hit puberty I was crazy about humping balloons, bean bag chairs (the vinyl liner ones), and inflatable pool toys. I remember one time when no one was home middle of the day I went skinny dipping and had so much fun just rubbing my dick all up and down the inflatable pool lounger. I remember wrapping my legs around it while I floated around in the pool with nothing on so I could rub my whole body over the inflatable. Fuck I really want to do that again now.

"I don't think in terms of ""I stop pursuing her at this point or that notion"". I just know two things:

- I only date girls that actually get me excited at the idea of dating her

- I only date girls who make it clear that they're as excited about the idea of dating me as I am about the idea of dating her

If she doesn't fulfill those two conditions as I get to know her, I move on. It's made my life fairly simple. I don't want to date a girl that I have to convince to be with me, I only wanna date a girl who's with me because she actually *wants* to be with me."

"It's freeing. I can go anywhere I want, whenever I want. I've traveled the world for a fraction of the cost. I still play video games all night sometimes. I'm more stable financially than I'd otherwise be. I have a fucking awesome house that would be awful for raising children in but is so much fun as an adult.

It's also been really fucking lonely at times. I've got a great girlfriend right now and have in the past as well, but my aversion to marriage/kids invariably becomes a problem as the relationships progress. And they move on at some point. 

I have a brother and he's married with one son (who's now in college). I've enjoyed being an uncle immensely and get some of my paternal instincts out on him. They're my family in the sense that I have one but they don't live near me so I don't see them as much as I'd like.

So elements of it are great. Elements of it are sometimes lonely and depressing. But overall I'm a pretty happy man."

You say you ended the date with hugs so have you kissed yet? If not then definitely make that your next goal, not making her your gf.

"Staying up late to enjoy more of ""my time"".

I wake up a little earlier to walk my dog, then get ready for work. Adding commute, work, and an hour lunch is a just over 10 hours of my day. Then I come home, hang out with my wife, make/get dinner, and walk the dog, run errands if need be. My wife works earlier than I do so generally she'll be in bed by 8 or 9. My time starts at this point. Don't get me wrong. I love my wife, my dog, and the time spent together. But I love being by myself as well. Playing video games, getting high, and watching my favorite TV shows. I work in a sales job so I talk all day long. I just love not having to please anyone but myself for a few hours and sometimes I'll push it and stay up till like 1 or 2 and be miserable the entire next day."

Without taking her eyes off the stage, a word, or even a slightest change in facial expression, she reached back and proceeded to give me a HJ to completion. She even deftly hiked her miniskirt up, and took my cum on hare bare ass to avoid smearing us both.

"Relax friend, she's already agreed to the second date! Take a deep breath, and recognize that she has already found things that she likes about you. 

I've often noticed that when I'm spending time with a new girl, and I feel a positive connection with her, she becomes the only thing I want for myself. I'd race around my mind, analyzing anything that could happen(positive or negative). Remaining stuck in my mind, instead of comfortable and enjoyable.

My Advice:
Relax, and try to catch your self before getting stuck in your head. Worrying is completely useless, and will only cause you to suffer twice. Don't freak out if there is some silence, it happens. When it does: take a moment, think of something you'd like to  know about her(common interests, hobbies, her family, friends, work schooling, television, movies, music, books, or food! Just to name a few). Then let the conversation flow.

Remind yourself that you are already good enough for her. This date is about you learning about her, not worrying about her.   "

Later I realize, ""Damn, that was an extremely smooth way to setup a double date.""**

How do you think people did this before facebook and all that, pigeon carrier?  

Just try to get her alone somehow during a break of some sort or after work and just bite the bullet after some casual small talk. Sure if she says no it'll be uncomfortable but if she is interested, it'll make more of an impression than a facebook message.

"How thoughtful they are. I've been with quite a few girls who just show up to dates, will hang around and it's all good. There's nothing that they do to surprise you or anything like that. 

One girl I really ended up loving and tragically left me when she had to go back to America. She was amazing. She came here on an exchange which basically meant she had a couple of hours of class a day max. I basically spent two months solid with her at one point. She was super thoughtful.  

She'd leave me in bed and I'd wake up to see she made me a coffee and left me a note. Like a really sweet and sarcastic at the same time note. So basically romantic and funny the whole package. She woke me up in bed to head, my dream for a long time. I brought her to my friends party around Christmas time, something I never do and she got on so well with my friends. We went to bed on what was basically the dogs bed but we didn't care we were hammered. She started sobbing and I found out then that she loved me. We just cuddled in that shitty makeshift bed and I dried up her tears. 

She gave me a bag of all her stuff she accumulated here and inside was a love note covered with words that still move me even nearly a year later. She made me a Spotify playlist with songs that we both listened to and related to one another and it just perfectly summer us up. I'm listening to it right now. 

You don't find people like that often. She was a beautiful bright burst of sunshine and made me immediately and immensely happy and we were unusually close so quickly, inseparable. Thoughtfulness is something I really appreciate and she was the dictionary definition."

"At 24 I was worried about being inadequate and in the end that was the only real pitfall to get over: my insecurity at being a late bloomer. 

Which was difficult because I'd gone my whole life without ever having felt particularly desirable and at first I was very paranoid about her cheating on me for no reason whatsoever. I was very suspicious of the idea that she'd want to be with me.

But the rest of it came very naturally to me. Romantic relationships aren't really a skill you getter better at. People who have been in lots of relationships are almost by definition the worst at them. 

It's more about whether you're a selfish piece of shit and whether you're willing to talk and compromise. 

You go into a relationship at the level of maturity you are. I didn't act like a 16-year-old who was learning to drive and it was a relationship between two 20-somethings. 24 isn't that old, so by the time we'd been together for a few years it was also the most serious relationship she'd been in. 

When it comes to sex and dating and all that - it did feel like she'd know all these secrets but at least at 24 it didn't really play out like that. 

You get the idea from the locker room and porn that people are out having fantastic crazy sex all the time. But I suspect that's not the case and actually most people in their 20s have had a lot of bad sex and often a lot of pathetic drunk sex.  I didn't tell her I was a virgin and she didn't even realise I had been until I told her a few months later. "

"I've raised 5 generations of dogs now - Newfoundlands and Irish Wolfhounds.

You know how I got over it?  I got another dog.

I'll be honest.  Dogs are the best.  Better than people IMO. that's why it's so sad that they live such short lives.  

I'm the one who puts them down in my family - it's both a sad and joyous event at this point in my life.  Sad because they are going to die and they know it.  Joyous because I see the pain leave their bodies.  The arthritic hips no longer hurt.  The clouded vision gone.  The aches of old age leave as the lethal injection does it's thing.  Then they exhale and they are gone.

I mourn for a couple of days and then move on.  I add a nail to the wall in the back entryway of our house next to the collars of the dogs who've come before him; I hang his old collar and screw his name tag above it.  

Now and again, when I take the puppy out, or the juvenile, I look at the line of collars hanging on the wall and smile because I know they were all good boys who led a good lives.  And then we go on with our walk."

In almost all of the cases I've seen, if the person in question could've understood the problem from a simple explanation, the breakup wouldn't have happened in the first place.

"Thank you.

As a dude, I really have no problem with 'mansplaining'. It can be misused and overused, but so are many words.

It calls attention to a particular tendency of behaviour that *does* have a gender correlation. Of course condescension can happen between any combination of genders, but there is an observable tendency for men to assume that women do not share the same level as knowledge as them, especially in particular fields, and deciding to explain something before having that assumption confirmed. 

I think it's important to acknowledge this behaviour and not conflate it with just ""being condescending""."

"Great for a while.  She had a habit of putting too much on her plate at once though.  Was trying to get straight A's, and have a job, and be president of clubs on campus, and be active in a sorority, and have an active social life, and be dating me.  Eventually the wheels just fell off.  She cracked and everything kind of just fell apart for her.  It was really sad, to be honest. Culminated in her getting arrested for assaulting a police officer.  She ended up not getting convicted, but the newspaper still ran the story of her arrest, including her mugshot.  Incident was the talk of the campus for a while.  Sorority kicked her out.  She stepped down from all her club offices.  She dyed her hair.  Basically tried to do everything she could to separate herself from the incident.  The whole thing set her behind on her degree, so she lost her scholarships and had to drop out with like a semester's worth of classes left.

Last I heard, she had kind of gotten herself back together. She was working to get enough money together to finish her degree, not sure if she ever did.  Found another guy, they were engaged last I heard."
Venting is done once before fixing the problem. Whining is done over and over and over again while the problem remains unfixed.

"my girlfriend thinks the same thing, but she's incredibly oblivious

I usually look a little longer than I need/want to so she'll notice because she once told me it was a confidence builder when she catches me peeking "
"My last relationship kind of ran into this. She lives in southeastern Virginia, and I traveled to her this past winter, spent a couple of months, thought about moving there and starting a life together with her.

But the economy down there is deader than disco. Jobs are scarce unless you're in shipbuilding or otherwise connected with the navy, wages are complete horseshit even when allowing for the low cost of living, and I'm a Pacific Northwest-dwelling pagan...the sheer amount of Jesus around makes it an unfriendly place if you're not a Christian, and people have no qualms about discriminating against those not of their faith.

Finally I told her that if we were going to have a future, it wasn't going to be in her hometown. I invited her to come to Seattle, decide for herself if she liked it, and we'd pick up where we'd left off (our relationship was fantastic but for the fact that I was broke and miserable whenever I wasn't with her.)

She declined. I moved back home.  It was for the best. I have a decent-paying job, an apartment in a neighborhood I love, and I genuinely feel at home here.

But some small piece of me wonders what might have been if I'd somehow convinced her to come with me. The conversation, the time spent together, the sex...all among the very best I've ever had (and I've been around a fair while.)

That's not to say I don't love the girl I'm dating now, only that the girl in Virginia...she'll always be special to me on some level."
"That's how it works with anything.

Jobs. Searching for apartments. Picking out puppies. Etc."
"A 23 year old is in a *vastly* different part of her life than a 30 or 40 yearold.

Honestly, I would be flattered. I might even be willing to put my dick in you. But I wouldn't see you as a mature, capable, long term option."

"Go out and do stuff. If that means going to a party, fine. Playing sports? Fine. Playing music/going to concerts? Fine. Just do something to keep yourself occupied, and meet as many people you can along the way. I know what you're going through, believe me on that, and the only true solution is to stay busy and let time run its course."
This is frequently asked?
"Never apologize if you honestly believe that you did nothing wrong.

"Other very real reasons: social anxiety, fear of meeting a stranger (if its an online thing), genuinely just not feeling up for getting ready and going out (I think guys may not consider how much effort it can take to get dressed up for a date). "
"I think it describes a real phenomenon, but it's misused as a thought terminating bludgeon so often that I pretty much stop listening as soon as it's said."
Only thing she should be clappin is her hands for Jesus. 
"Damn, it's nice she said that and all, but the ""smooth"" bar for women is so much lower than for men..."
"Yeah, an ex of mine did it once too, in the middle of sex. It ended with me crying with laughter and her being rather frustrated and pissed off."
"be more talkative in general. talk to everybody. your older neighbor, the guy ahead of you in line at the store, you name it. then practice. keep on talking to girls until you don't care about the outcome. and never care too much. there's a ton of interesting women out there. also, if a woman is interested in you, she will in most cases react positively to your advances and that adds momentum to the conversation, so you don't need to feel like carrying the weight of the world. just talk more in general until it becomes part of your daily life. then be that person regardless of who you're with. never worry too much, there's always another girl, believe me.

EDIT: also, learn to just ""be"". as in, never try to play a role or be somebody else. just be yourself and relax. you don't need to entertain at all cost, you don't need to be accepted. accept yourself and understand that to many people, what you got is what they are looking for. and with those people, things will go smoothly. whenever you feel stressed, just ""pause"" everything and do nothing, just ""be"". allow yourself to be plain, boring or whatever else at times. it's perfectly fine.

also, if you want a convo to take off, ask thoughtful questions about the other person. for example, why did they choose this job, do they still enjoy it after all those years, how are their parents doing, etc. let them talk and chime in every now and again. drop interesting facts about yourself in-between, but don't overdo it. all-in-all, genuinely caring and not worrying about the outcome works wonders with many women."
"Do women not do this too?  Admittedly I'm a bi guy so maybe it's the guy in me, but I've honed my skills for guys as well. 

You know when you guys take off your sweatshirt?  When you stretch reallllllllly far over your head or bent back?  When you go up stairs?

Gotcha. "
