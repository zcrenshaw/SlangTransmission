"When I'm walking down the street and I see an incredibly handsome guy or really beautiful woman, I think to myself.  Yup, def a redditor.  Because all redditors, especially those who frequently post on Askreddit threads like this, like me are irresistible, super sexy individuals.



Right?  right?"
"We were waiting outside to eat for a long time.  From the front of the formation, we hear the TI scream “Jesus Christ, who’s serving food in there?  The drummer from Def Leppard?”  

Edit:
We had fire guard/suicide watch guys all the time.  When someone needed access to our living area, they had to put their Common Access Card up to the window so he could check to see if you were on the approved list.  He’d say something like “One, white, common access card.  Staff Sergeant Diaz.”

Apparently a TI found a Pokémon card on his way up and put that shit up to the window.  The kid on duty, without missing a beat, yells out, “one, yellow, Pokémon Card.  Pikachu.” "
All the drug dealers at my school wear supreme and Gucci but don’t have rich parents but I def see those kids way more often
