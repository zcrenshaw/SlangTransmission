"I’m blind and have been since I was 10 so I wasn’t sexually aware when it happened. 

Of all the things you need to think about now sex isn’t one of them. Look at the faces of your loved ones and remember them. See sunrises and sunsets. Look at the beauty around you. 

Sex is great when you are blind and take it from me most sighted people will not experience it like you will.

"If you go straight to chowing down in 'gina town, you're doing it wrong. You always start with fingering first. Then you wait for the perfect moment to ""scratch your nose"" or something similar and discretely smell your finger. Now you're ready to make an informed decision."

I know a few guys who did this- one in particular was because his family were absolutely vile to him so he decided to take on his wife’s name as a mark of starting his new family.

"If she’s as insecure as you say she is: “I don’t care about the size of your breasts” isn’t as supportive of a statement as you think. She’s likely interpreting it as “Yes your breasts are unfortunately small but I’m willing to overlook it.” It can come across as you trying to dismiss the issue or change the subject because you agree that her insecurity is gross. 

Next time she complains about her breasts, instead of saying “I don’t care about that” say “I love your boobs” or “I think it’s sexy” or whatever.

"Worrying about that guy walking behind me on a dark night. I'm a big guy, but if someone wants to attack me and has a weapon I'm done.

Sure, I'm not scared of getting raped but I can still be mugged, beaten or murdered."

"Mama always warned me that exposing my calves to esteemed gentlemen would be my ruin and a guaranteed ticket to spinsterhood. 

But I cannot help myself! Seeing the reactions of these flustered gents makes me quiver in my drawers!

"The petty and passive aggressive atmosphere at some work places with women is pretty damn toxic. Something about the way woman are socialized to act around ""competition"" mixed with forced professionalism causes it I think."
Do you have a face full of hair and an awkward boner too? Those are the other vital interactions to a proper snuggle.
I accidentally joined a gay study group in college. I had no idea they were gay until like an hour into our first study session. Cool dudes.
"Omg. My second girlfriend (and my first time going down on someone) almost ruined it for life. She was afraid of her genitalia and had never (you read that right) cleaned it directly. I came SO close to throwing up but powered through... because I had a Dr. Pepper I could chase her taste with.

Next time I went down on her, I kissed her right afterwards. She threw up.

Fun times."

I wouldn't find it creepy at all. I would find it super sweet and it would make me feel great to have her.
"
&gt;Also would like to see men’s physical standards for sexiness be raised so high (by surgery) and to have the ‘one perfect dick type’ standard, like we do for vaginas (where the rest of vaginas are GROSS or whatever), so that men can feel emasculated and unattractive and like they don’t measure up. That would be AWESOME. 

Because men definitely aren't held to unreasonable standards of attractiveness, and men definitely don't get insulted for not having a big enough dick, and men definitely don't ever feel emasuclated by pretty much all of modern media..."
"I think traditionally the role of the groomzilla is to show up drunk at the wedding and vomit during the ceremony.

[Like this guy.](https://youtu.be/vQpXvowqjCc)

Haven't seen it myself, but YouTube is full of videos. 

At my wedding, I planned to be stone cold sober. My groomsmen had plans to kidnap me, tie me up, and take me to a strip club for a lap dance while they poured tequila down my throat. They were cruising around town looking for me.

My best man was a bro. He told the guys, ""If you find him, bring him to my house."" Then he hid me at his house and we watched *Star Trek* and ate pizza all night while the rest of the guys drove around.

"An attorney my company used to work with took his wife’s name. His name before marriage was “Butts” and he didn’t want his children to go through what he went through...

I also like to meet my friends, go to concerts, meet new people, etc.

"Not so much advice, but my dating profile was more or less created by my female friends. I made mine initially and apparently it was terrible. They did an excellent job."
"I suppose some things that fall under this (just off the top of my head): 

* Expectation of children.  The most common answer to saying you don’t want kids is “oh you’ll change your mind”.   Can’t say if this happens to dudes too though since I haven’t talked about it with the guy friends.  

* The concept that women are off limits to retaliation.  The whole “you don’t hit a girl” thing, even if she’s the aggressor.  That’s just dumb.  Personally, if I just decide to whale on someone (even a dude), I fully expect to get hit back.  

* Recently you can’t like being “feminine” if you’re a feminist.  

* The idea that being smart and caring about how you look have to be mutually exclusive.  That’s probably more a high school thing though.  

* I’m not sure about this one, but there’s this weird idea that all women are automatically competition, especially romantically.  However I’m leaning towards this might be more an issue of immaturity.

"I know you said sex act, but, have you considered trying some crazy hallucinogenic while you still have sight - and then trying it again when your other eye goes?  That's gotta be a pretty unique experience."
"Objectification of their gender in media.

I see constant images of men with shredded figures and bare torsos every day. How blind do you have to be to not see that men's bodies are every bit as objectified as women's in advertising and media? Men are possibly objectified more-so now. Unlike the 80s when you weren't allowed to release an R-rated movie without bare tits in it, we actually rarely see even partial frontal nudity of women in films now. Conversely, it's hard to find any PG-13 movie where the ripped male protagonist doesn't have a gratuitous shirtless scene.

I'm not gnashing my teeth or twisting my knickers about it, but I do roll my eyes whenever I see complaints about the use of women's bodies in media as if it is a specific female experience that men couldn't possibly understand. I didn't grow up with this cartoon on TV every day or anything:

https://imgur.com/a/cZzgO 

This was the culturally progressive action movie we all celebrated this year:

https://imgur.com/a/CyPVA

Men don't complain about it often. It's not really worth complaining about... but the display of men's unclothed bodies is used constantly in our culture. This is not something special that happens to women.

"I was 69ing with a woman who started to ""squirt"" directly into my mouth when she was orgasming. She was normal down there, but the constant flow of concentrated vagina juice was one of the most disgusting things I've ever experienced.
  
But, you know what? I started to think of all the times women had my semen in their mouth. I'm pretty sure that doesn't takes all too well either. This woman was cumming hard, and I didn't want to spoil that and possibly hurt her feelings in the process. So I swallowed it like a champ. That was probably one of my most feminist moments."

She got her period a few days later, and after that, we went at it. I start to go down, and start to get the taste of pennies on my tongue. I don't think much of it, but it starts to get worse. I stop, and notice that there's blood on the couch cushion now. She got another full period not even 48 hours after her last one finished. Never seen her so embarrassed, but we were able to laugh about it. Thankfully, her periods evened out after a few months.

Or maybe even better: switch around the colours inside the pens so his blue pens write black and his black pens write red and the one green pen he has is the only blue one.

Or just remove all the springs from the pens so he can get the point out, but never in. 

Or you can draw on his post its. Not the first one though, make sure it's about five in. It will be too long after the fact to suspect you.

Once he got the testosterone injections he stopped being attracted to women where he'd say, fantasize about talking/dating them and other romantic/sensual things and started being attracted to *parts* of them.

"I once attended a wedding as a gf of one of the *13* groomsmen. It was a 9:00am wedding and lots of the guys were on day 2 of a 48 hour hangover from the bachelor party.

Dancing, singing, *trying* to hype up the crowd of mostly middle aged to senior family members. The groomsmen litteraly did nothing. Didn't even break rank or tap a toe.

"In the concept of toxic masculinity, we accept that it affects men and women in bad ways. For toxic femininity, fewer people admit that it also affects men in bad ways. It's difficult to suggest that women can be sexist towards men without being accused of being a misogynist. Part of toxic femininity to me is the way societal problems are phrased, where women are always seen as victims and only men have agency. Toxic masculinity hurts women, and toxic femininity hurts... women? Where's the symmetry in that. I believe women uphold the patriarchy about as much as men. In mate selection, in personal lifestyle choices, and in attitudes toward men and each other. The whole ""women are wonderful and can do nothing wrong"" is to me at the center of toxic femininity, since it takes away their own agency and responsibility in things that matter. "
"I knew of someone in a common international biker gang who met a lady and eventually left the gang. When he married her, he changed his last name to her's so he would be harder to find and there would hopefully be less trouble in the future. They also changed countries.

I can only change myself really... but I know in myself how I strive to refuse to treat others in a catty way, I don't enjoy spreading negative gossip.

"Probably not what you're looking for, but I used to work right on the edge of the gay village in Toronto. I was working late one night and walking to catch the last subway home. It was a Friday night. Typically kids from the suburbs would make their way to the Big City and look for trouble. Gay-bashing was a thing at this time. 

So I'm walking to the subway at about 1 in the morning, I'm a big manly straight dude. A car slows down beside me. There's five people in it. It's a clown car of young suburban idiots. 

Someone says out the window, ""Hey man, where the ho's at?"" Like it was a test to see if I was ""hetero"" or not. I just didn't want to play.

I say, ""Sorry man, can't help you.""

One of them says, ""Faggot. Fucking faggot.""

I start thinking I'm in some serious danger. I was close to the subway. I didn't look at them or respond. I just walked as fast as I could into the subway station. If I'd been a few steps further away from those doors, who knows what might have happened.

I've never felt that kind of immediate danger to my life, ever. I felt hatred against gay people right in my very soul, and I think a pretty good inkling about what racist hatred must feel like too, and it was fucking horrifying. "

"A French movie grossly mislead me about what swingers clubs/ porn theatres are like.  I thought it would be a lounge bar type thing.  I was a strapping young lad so I expected a couple in their 30's and in black and white would invite me to join them for some long cigarettes and conversation with minimal eye contact \- gazing at the floor and off into the distance like other things weighed on our minds.  The wife would do things to me as the husband browsed the wine list.  This place was in a basement \- fair enough.  A little creepy but not too bad.  I descend the stairs and wind up in what looks like a doctor's waiting room.  

There are chairs lining the walls all facing this massive screen which has porn playing.  There is a young guy beating his dick like there is a time limit \- he doesn't even register my presence.  Ahead of me there are two hallways.  To the left I see a screen with gay porn playing ""that must be the gay area"" I thought naively.  I follow the hallway to the right.  The room is similar to the first in size but is much nicer.  There is a big puffy leather lounge with two older men in it.  They're masturbating to gay porn but their hearts aren't in it \- they're talking about other porno theatres they go to and how they're disapointed how one of them has suffered under new management.

I make my way through six rooms of guys watching gay porn and masturbating lazily or furiously and nowhere inbetween before I wind up in the room I identified as ""the gay area"" when I first arrived, I had almost done a lap of the entire premises.  I walked through this section into the first room.  The guy from before has gone.  I want to leave, but I also paid $10 to get in.  I now understand this section \- it's for people like me who had prepared themselves to blow a load and didn't want to walk around with blue balls.  "

"try to organize something special once in a while. talk a lot with her, not just chit chat but deep talk. and it seems like you need to open up to her as well. instead of asking for advice here (which is fine) don't be afraid to ask her and tell her what you feel too (but don't make it seem like you're under stress because of this/she's not doing a good job as a girlfriend). girls love to talk. a lot.

"Rather than fill my free time with social activity, I fill it with hobbies. For example, I read around 50 books per year, I go hiking or running with my dog when it's nice out, I train Brazilian jiu-jitsu some weeknights and weekend afternoons, I love to cook, I travel 1-2 times internationally per year and shoot and edit videos chronicling my trips, etc. I don't have social anxiety or anything like that, I just prefer to be by myself, or with just one or perhaps two other people when I go out. I assume most introverts are the same.

And despite what you might think from the replies we're not all chronic masturbators. I use tinder and go on dates from time to time but mostly I just prefer hanging out with my dog and letting my brain dive into things that interest me.

I'm not afraid of social activity, I just prefer to do other things. I'm exceptionally happy living this way and find it unfortunate that introversion is often immediately assumed to mean that somebody is a miserable shut-in, terrified of social activity while simultaneously wishing they were better at engaging in it. I don't feel that describes me accurately.

"My best friend growing up was a girl. Every time we’d be somewhere and I saw a cute girl, I’d ask how to go about meeting her. I always thought it was some intricate science. I’d get the same answer from her every single time. “Go say hi, tell her you noticed her and thought she looked pretty, and ask if you could have her number.” Worked every time. So basically, just be straight-forward."
"Oh, this happens everywhere, even in feminist organizing groups and spaces. Only there, everyone's trying to pretend that they have no misogynistic impulses whatsoever, so they lash out at and ostracize each other for being ""problematic"" instead of fat or ugly or slutty. Mean girls are going to be mean girls no matter where they are, they just change their language depending on what is socially acceptable in that group."

"Was playing spin the bottle in high school with some girls, some guys. and this younger dude. I spin and it lands on the younger dude. We have to kiss. 

He’s very reluctant about it, but I’m all for the dare. It’s taking ages to convince him so I just go “3.. 2.. 1..!!!” and we peck each other. Literally a peck. The girls go nuts. 

Later I start to piece together that he’s not the most good looking guy, and not the most confident either, so I ask him: 

“Hey, have you kissed a girl before?” 
“...no” he says. 
“Was I your first kiss?”

His face goes red. Turns out I was his first kiss! Many a laugh was had. I was never ashamed of it, but it took me by surprise at the time lol. Will always be a funny story to me.  

Edit: he got two other girls to kiss him that night too! i just happened to be his first. "
"[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lP70mrN388) is one of my favorite examples of it.

I just feel like it would be really weird if Mila Kunis went on Kimmel and he pulled something like that and all of the guys in the audience started cheering and whistling.

"Social combatants. They know they can't fight in the physical realm, but if they're unhappy (or just plain sociopathic) they will fight you in the psychological realm. Make up fake shit about you. Gossip. Make you look bad when you've done nothing wrong. Then play victim.

I had a female friend, let's call her A, that claimed her ex was very physically abusive and would start all kinds of trouble. I felt pity for her and asked her why she would date such a guy. Then she dated a new dude, who she also claimed was abusive and started trouble. What? Much later on, a friend's friend told me that A was a chronic liar, loved to pick fights, would provoke her boyfriend until he got violent out of sheer rage, then play victim. And she did this with every single boyfriend. Crazy.

Now I always try to hear both sides of the story. And if anyone, guy or girl, tells me a sob story, I'm more skeptical and don't automatically assume they're 100% truthful."

"Well, I am not sure if this exactly qualifies as a groomzilla story, but I'll share it since it is a slight wedding horror story perpetrated by the groom. 

I went to my step sons wedding last week. During the traditional cake cutting, they each feed each other a small piece. EVERY ONE in the history of weddings knows that the bride may have a little leeway with the smashing of the cake in the groom's face but that it's a big no-no to make a mess of the bride. The groom is supposed to do it gently. Well, the bride does hers rather nicely and he gets away rather unscathed. However, the groom, thought it would be hilarious to smash the cake all over her face. And he did. It got everywhere, including in her eye. She got upset, naturally, and ran out of the room to clean up and probably cool down. All of the guests were horrified for her.

Before he could follow her out, some of his groomsmen caught him and smashed a huge piece of (blue) cake all over his face. They both came back after a few minutes, cleaned up and relatively smiling. I can only imagine that she let him have it while they were alone. Seeing the cake all over his face probably made the whole thing much more bearable for her. She's either really laid back and forgiving or one hell of an actress. The rest of the night well, she handled it like a champ! "
"I didn't take my wife's name - but I did change my own name before I got married.  Long story short- they put my step-father's name on my birth certificate and I changed my name to the name my family originally immigrated with.

"Love it. It shows a level of interest that I appreciate, and there's something very sexy about being pinned under her, too."
"And I feel half the time the standards are set by other women.

Like I can appreciate when a girl puts the effort in, but she'll even say herself ""I'm not doing this for you"" or whatever. Like women are setting the bar for each other and then men are blamed because they set their own bar much lower. Obviously not all women do this, most are decent. It's the ones that complain about it the most though that often tend to do it themselves.

There are some *genuine* problems in that thread (Doctor, Indian family dynamics) but half of them were just ""I don't like this one thing and I think it's a gender issue and can have no other cause"". Or ""Men do this one thing and it's because they look down on us and there can be no other reason"".

For example, there's the fact that when introduced, a girl might be introduced as the man's girlfriend. Is this sexist? Sometimes. Other times it might just be that it's a case of ""This is John (Who I want you to talk to), and this is his wife Gina""

And they had one calling out people for defending other men. Like men aren't going to get a bit defensive when you start saying ""Men are all ____, as demonstrated by this situation"" and a man would look at the situation differently. Asked your boyfriend to borrow the chair? Clearly he sees the man as owning it, and not the woman. It clearly wouldn't have anything to do with something like the man being bigger (More noticeable) or just the fact that men are usually more comfortable talking to other men. No it has to be that he looks down on women, not that he could be intimidated in some way."

"Testosterone makes you wired for faster decision making, task completion, and ""object"" oriented thinking. Getting the decision ""done"" is the goal, not getting the decision ""the best one possible"". Even toddlers as young as 1-year-olds will go for the ""tools"" instead of the dolls to play with.

Estrogen wires you for people skills. Women can tune in to facial micro-expresions and interpret them at a level men can't even dream of. Again in toddlers we see girls go for the dolls instead of the tools when given the choice of toy to play with.

Now, this is all on average, of course. We're the same species, and between the genders we're more alike than we are different, but it's pretty obvious that we're not exactly the same.

"You're kissing a woman.  Hands are roaming across her body but not yet on her tits/ass/pussy, things are starting to get hot.  Move your mouth away from her mouth and start kissing her ear.  Gently bite/lick/suck her earlobe.  Use your tongue lightly so you don't get saliva everywhere.  Work your way around the outside of her ear avoiding the area near the ear canal (you don't want saliva to get in there because it feels disgusting).  Whisper sexy things in her ear *you're so hot/you're body is so sexy/I want you/you're making me so hard/etc.*  Kiss and mouth the area behind her ear.  One hand on the back of her head and another roaming her body, but not directly touching her breasts/pussy.   Pull her towards you showing your strength, make sure your pelvises are touching.  Work your way with your mouth from her ears slowly down her neck.  *Go very slowly*.  Start kissing up and down her neck.  Gently bite her neck.  Move one of your hands down the side of her body, your thumb just *barely* grazing the side of her breast.  Run that hand down over her hip and grab a handful of ass.   Keep her in your grip at all times with either your hand on her head or her ass.  Your other hand can now move to her breast.  Touch/squeeze the breast gently, postponing touching the nipple to build up her anticipation, until you finally more strongly move in for the nipple while your hand engulfs the entire breast.   Continue kissing her neck but slowly work down her chest.  Kiss her breasts over her shirt.  Both hands on ass now.  Slowly move one of your hands from her ass under her shirt to her breasts.  Your mouth should still be on her breasts.   With one hand on her bare breast, the other hand moves slowly up her spine, up her neck and to the base of her neck where her hair starts.  Once your hand gets to her hair, the other hand should go to grab her ass, and your mouth should move slowly up her chest to her neck.  Gently but firmly grab a handful of her hair *at the root of the hair near her scalp* and gently but firmly pull down on her hair so it pulls her head up exposing her neck.  Kiss and gently bite her neck while pulling down on her hair, grabbing her ass, and telling her all the incredibly nasty things you're going to do to her.

She'll likely be putty in your hands at this point lol

There are multiple ways we tell the people in our life how we care about them. My wife is ""acts of service (devotion)"", aka cooking for me, helping me with stuff, etc. I am the  ""words of affirmation"" (saying I love you) and ""physical touch"" (kiss good night, kiss before she leaves for work, hugs, etc.). Might help you to better show your feelings for her. Communication, in its many ways and forms, are what keeps relationships going. Ask her what she wants from the relationship, and ask her to be honest with you. If she is subtle, ask her to be not so subtle. She may also be looking for affirmation that you are serious about the relationship. If you are, tell her that. If you think about kids with her, or getting a place together, or marriage, tell her that. Keep in mind timeframes. If you have been dating for two weeks, those things are way too serious to have a conversation about at that time. That being said, I had a friend marry a girl six months after dating and they are married for 5 years now, so it is every bit dependent on you and her. But yea, as he said, communication is key. Sit down, talk to her over drinks or dinner or something, and see what she is expecting out of the relationship.

Whenever we're in the same social situation (like our kids' birthday party or something) we always slip little phrases or comments into our conversations which *could* be interpreted, by someone who doesn't know the both of us, to mean that he and I used to be together in some kind of hardcore sexual relationship.

"Humans are attracted to people; it's how we work and how our brains are wired to reproduce and survive.  Even someone who is 100% committed and 100% in love with their SO will still look and sometimes daydream about other people.

It's natural.  

But realize that you're always going to be searching for that ""spark"" and your curiosity will never be truly satisfied.  Let's say that suddenly decided to break up with your girlfriend and started to date one of these ""fascinating and interesting"" women.  

I'm sure the excitement would last for a little while, but soon you'd find yourself in the same situation: the relationship would stagnate and suddenly you'd be noticing another woman that you feel that ""spark"" with, and the cycle continues on and on and on.

It's one of those ""grass is always greener on the other side"" parts of life.  You should work on (a) appreciating the relationship you have and (b) finding out why there isn't that spark in the relationship you're in and seeing what you can do to improve it."

"Women who see themselves as the providers of sexual interactions, while men have to earn it.

What women can do: be open about what you want. Tease us, make us feel desired. Let the both of us have fun and feel appreciated. Realize that you are trying to get in my pants just as I am trying to get into yours. We are playing ping pong, not basketball.

Women who expect to be able to hit, kick and punch other men when they feel slighly offended, while a man is always one slap away from an assault charge.

What women can do: either do not hit other people, or expect a fight when doing so without making a fuss about it.

Women who are obese and expect fit men to be attracted to them in the belief that society is unfair, while at the same time not seeing a fat man as potential partners.

What women can do: realize you are entitled to nothing, and that if the majority of men is not attracted to you then maybe you should re evaluate yourself or lower your standards.

Women who seek equality where it doesn't belong. Take the military for example, where the majority of people who succeed are obviously men. That is not sexist. You need to be at a specific fitness level to even hope to stand a chance, as your enemies do not care about what gender you are. 

What women can do: accept that some things are not as easy for them as they are for men. If you want to be a soldier, you are going to have to put in two times the effort of a man to reach his same level of strength. It is not unfair, don't make a scene about.

Apparently at their apartment during the bachelor party, our best friend (the Groom) got fucked up bad. And they had their bachelor party the night before the wedding. He passed out on the couch and shit himself. My brother and one of our other friends cleaned him up and cleaned the mess up, and put him to bed. He said that it wasn't, Um... Solid shit either, and it kind of just kept coming out. This all happened while they were all drunk, and the groom was passed out. My brother told me not to tell the Bride.

As I'm dropping off some stuff from dunkin donuts to the salon the girls were getting their hair done at, the groom calls his bride to be to tell her there is a problem with the cake... 

Luckily I picked up the phone since she was in the middle of getting her hair done, and was able to run interference and work with the maid of honor and the two mothers (and roped in his father) to figure it out. 

Can't believe he thought it was a good idea to tell his wife something is potentially going wrong just hours before the ceremony starts. "

"Theres a saying, it's that, 90% of perception is 9 tenths of the law. Now, you've likely heard it before, but have you ever really embodied it? What I mean is, without using more stupid sayings, words have meaning, but actions are far more telling of someone's mindset.  People want to believe people when they say something, but if, for so long, you have believed one idea, words won't easily change your mind.

Now, since you are new to this relationship, you don't have as much weight in her life so to completely rewrite her opinions of herself quickly or easily. Not that you can with even a mature relationship, but even less so. Add to that, you also haven't really broken the door to getting frisky and it's even harder. So she's going to be insecure, you can lay the ground work to helping her here, but it will take time.

If you are comfortable being more upfront, you can do the following. My girlfriend, like all people, has insecurities.  She doesn't like her nose, her ""small"" boobs or her skin in some areas due to medical condition damage. Now, to me and to anyone who isn't an idiot, she's a smokeshow.  So how do I help? Well I can't save her, but I can *show* her what I think.  This will get graphic, but I'm still going to share it.  

I think she is absolutely gorgeous. I love her nose and the skin damage she has on her cheeks only adds to it... somehow. (There's a really sexy honesty to her taking her makeup off around me). I kiss her nose, run my fingers over it, stare at her face and say, ""how are you so damned hot"". I catch her from behind, hug her and kiss her cheek(randomly and all the time).

I definitely sneak peeks of her undressing as much as possible, letting her catch me sometimes. I struggle to keep my hands off her honestly.  I really enjoy squeezing, kissing and all manner of sexualizing her breasts.  I'll usually let out a quiet and honest, ""god your body is amazing"" mumble.  She asks me ""why do you like them"" and run a hand over them and lift up her shirt and let her know with...my mouth (not words, cough) that she's amazing.

Add to all this the fact that I'm an absolute teenager around her - I'm talking hormones kids, it's hard like 90% of the time. And I like to believe she's convinced I might like her.  She's finally starting to accept that she's quite stunning. She's starting to buy more confident clothing and she'll say, ""ooo, that'd be sexy on me"", so I know it's having a positive effect.  She's also told me that she feels so incredibly sexy around me that she has so much more confidence in life in general. Hey, I'm just returning the favor because she makes me feel like Thor God of SexThunder.

Anyway enough about me, my point is. You can say all the right words and still not have an effect. Don't be downtrodden, just readjust your attempts. Maybe all she needs is a guy to show her she's the sexy lady she is.

More “active” pics. I thought I looked better in other pics, but I was told that’s boring and I think they were right. I let them choose which pictures, and in what order. 

Also, instead of my bunch of crappy little jokes they put in one good one. The joke also involves a fun activity, so I get a ton of “LOL let’s do that!”. It’s amazing, I’d say 4/5 of the messages I get are responding to that joke. 

After these changes I noticed an immediate difference. Now I get about 5-10 Tinder matches a day, 10-20 on Bumble, and roughly 100 on OkCupid (Don’t know what’s up with that, it’s overwhelming).

Anyway this recent time I was pulling her panties off slowly because she was a major /r/pawg and I notice this little blackish/brownish ball on her butt, I actually flicked it off in sort of an automatic response type of way before I realized what it was.

I tried to push through but once the panties were all the way off the entire room filled with a nasty shit meets funk smell, lost my boner in minutes, havent talked to her since. 

Edit: to clear something up, the brownish/blackish ball was about the size of a rolled up tinfoil you'd get from a pack of gum, maybe even slightly smaller, it wasn't a FULL turd

"I think most young guys really get everything wrong when it comes to a girl's sexual past.  They literally do the exact opposite of what they should do.

Imagine you are an 21 year-old college guy.  You are horny all the time, you're into at least two sorta-weird fetish-type things that you'd never want to admit to in public.  You watch porn at least once a day.  You have a list of kinky things you'd love to do.

So basically....a typical 21 year-old guy.

You meet a girl at a party, or online or whatever.  You have a good time, but you learn she did some kinky thing, or hooked up with a lot of guys, or slept with two guys at the same time.  And you think, 'Wow, what a slut.  Totally not wife material!'  Or you just feel insecure, jealous, upset, and otherwise can't handle it.

Instead, you find a 'nice girl'.  A girl who maybe had sex once or twice, but it was with her long term boyfriend.  And by all accounts, it was pretty vanilla.  And you think, 'Aww, she's perfect!'

What you don't realize, is that the she already has had the type of sex life she wanted.  She wasn't waiting for you to come around and then flip the 'total kinky slut' switch.  So you start dating her, thinking that once the relationship progresses, then she'll do X, Y and Z like you've always wanted. 

Years later, you are dating or married to a girl who doesn't really care that much about sex.  She isn't into any of the stuff you wish she was.  She enjoys sex in one or two positions, once every week or two, and maybe if it's your birthday you'll get a blowjob.  Because she just isn't that into sex.  And you'll spend the rest of your life (bitterly) joking about how 'Girls don't like sex'.

Nah - it's just you intentionally avoided girls who really liked sex.  The girls that really were into sex and would have been totally down for trying X, Y and Z (and other stuff you never thought about), they were at those parties too.  You even met some of them.  And you were like, 'Nah, no thanks.'

I've done it.
Most of my friends have done it.

In an extreme case, my good friend married a girl, had kids and everything, eventually couldn't take it any more, started cheating on his wife because of her lack of interest in sex, got caught, got divorced, and now is very bitter towards women.  But I vividly remember him talking about not dating a girl he'd just met because she was too slutty.  He messed around with the first night they met at party, but because she was to willing to do physical stuff that he absolutely loved doing, he decided she was too easy and must have done similar stuff with other guys.  And that made her 'not gf material'.

And this guy was the biggest horn-dog I knew.  When people in our group first turned 18, he'd beg them to buy him porn (I'm old, this is when internet porn sucked) because he was still 17 and couldn't.  Everything he did was an attempt to get laid, he always wanted to hit up the strip clubs, and was always talking about sex.

Dude should have found the sluttiest girl he could.  He did the exact opposite.  "
"&gt; if I know my dick isn't fresh I'm not letting a girl go down there but the amount of girls I've been with who are plenty happy to let me go down there when they are anything but fresh is concerning. 

That's... so interesting that you say that. Because in my experience girls will actually *stop* guys from going down on them because they're too self conscious and paranoid even when they have no reason to be. Meanwhile, every single dude I've been with has asked me to go down on him at some point or another when he stank. And every woman I know has had similar experiences. "

http://honeybadgerbrigade.com/2014/11/12/femininities-toxic-femininity/

Brief summary of some of the examples from the article: 

**Damseling** -  Damseling is the female end of White Knighting—one cannot exist without the other. It is a celebration of helplessness and dependence on someone else’s protection.

**The “It’s Worse When It Happens to Women” meme** - This not restricted to rape either. This was a big part of the FGM/MGM discussion until mostly feminists shouted it down.

**Appropriation of Others’ Suffering** -  This is why homophobia has to, has to be a form of femmephobia. This is how legislative attacks on women’s health services get hyperventilated into a “War on Women.” War is war; how many women are coming back from the War on Women with legs blown off?

**The Princess and the Pea** -  Daintiness is generally a good thing, but it can be weaponized. Nobody much likes getting their hands dirty, but if you think a girl shouldn’t have to do this or that dirty job and besides that’s what boys are for, that’s taking daintiness too far.

**Bambi-ing** -  This is a tendency for society to conflate women and children, to assign women a claim to the same kind of care, protection, and leniency afforded children. Obviously it is misogynist, but its effects are misandrist as well, both since men get the job of babying women and also since getting this kind of care gets typed as non-masculine, so they are cut out of care when they need it.

**The Female Sentencing Discount** -  This is an institutional and systemic form of female privilege in which female perpetrators either receive lighter punishments or even are not prosecuted at all for the same or convicted crimes as men. It is quite well documented."
"I was best man in two weddings back to back.  I decided to simply do the toasts extemporaneously.  

The first went by pretty well, since I liked both people.  

When it came time to say something nice about the bride at the second of these two weddings, I suddenly realized I should have prepared to say something nice.  I could think of nothing positive to say about this woman.  

Later they're divorced and my buddy considers her the bane of his existence.  I should have made a better effort to communicate to him that I didn't like her.  I could have maybe saved my friend a lot of misery.  

My god though, what an awkward moment.  Best man standing there with the microphone going ""and S, what a woman, she's ... uh ..."""
"When I do couples therapy I'm always careful with this.

Sometimes the industry gets caught up in this idea that 'men don't listen' and forgets something I learned with one of my first clients:

Some women *literally never stop complaining*.

One of the things that always defaulting to encouraging partners to listen without judging or problem solving has done has been to create a situation where certain women are validated for behaviors that don't lead to long term solutions, i.e. playing the Damsel in Distress or in really blunt terms: Being Fucking Useless at Life.

I point this out because a lot of the time it comes out in therapy.  She'll sit there complaining about him, and I'll turn and say ""so what are you thinking"" and he'll say something crudely resembling ""This problem has existed for a decade and no attempt has ever been made to resolve or change it.  I cared for the first ten years, but now I'm judging""

That problem solving instinct sometimes comes from a low tolerance for emotion.  But it can also come from frustration and burn out.

I just say this because I'm pretty sure you won't hear it anywhere else, and I promise you that responding gently with ""This has been going on for a long time, and it's clearly upsetting you, should we consider making some efforts to fix the issue?"" is much nicer than letting it continue until you explode with ""You just never stop fucking whining do you?!"""

You may think we don't notice all the subtleties and nuances, but we do, your actions speak volumes about you as a long term partner. If we feel like we're always the bad guy, and nothing we do is good enough, we're going to leave, simple as that.

Reason I say this is because some people seem to think as long as the sex it's fine right? No, the sex can feel empty and hollow, almost soul crushing when you feel like the person is just using it as bait or to keep you around."

"My pastor told me this one. Every best man knows he only has two jobs. 1. Get the groom to the wedding on time and (relatively) sober. 2. Hold onto the rings.

The pastor was officiating a ceremony in the winter in a country club in front of a big gothic fireplace. Beautiful architecture. Very imposing. Pretty kick-ass as a centerpiece behind the couple. 

Only problem is the best man had a bit of a fumble when he went to hand over one of the rings. A fumble DIRECTLY INTO THE FIRE. And of course, freaking out, he dives after said ring almost also directly into the fire, thankfully having a change of heart at the last second before he would have went flying in.

Country club staff had to put out the fire and dig through the ashes for the ring, and the best man got a pretty nasty burn on his hand.

"The expectation that I view all other women as my ""sisters"" and hold them above all men - that I will automatically take a woman's side in any debate, argument or fight, and that I will go so far as to abandon my male friends in the event that someone female points a finger in their direction even if she is a total stranger.

That shit ain't healthy."

"&gt;Ladies with beautiful personalities more than make up for their physical flaws.

As a thirty-something, lowering the bar for physical flaws is absolutely necessary, but I really wish all the women my age didn't come with kids and/or mountains of credit card and student loan debt for worthless degrees. "
"Women are far harder on other women for their weight, appearance, style etc than the majority of men but it's accepted.

""Real women have...."" the idea a thin woman with small breasts is less feminine than a ""curvier"" woman is a very female based concept.

""It's okay that you're fat a man should just accept you the way you are."" Yes you should be happy with who you are but telling a woman it is okay to be 5'1"" and 220 pounds isn't doing her any favors. I watched my mom for decades hear this from het friends and now at 72 she has had a stroke, can rarely walk without pain in her knees and has to be very careful about what she eats because she is borderline diabetic. The sad thing is she always hated being overweight but her friends convinced her it was society's fault and not her own that she felt that way."
Cuddling is intimate. I’m not intimate with my male friends. Maybe if we were freezing to death in the tundra. 
"According to MIT, the most disorienting delay is 0.2s, and it’s important to note that feedback is inevitable with an analog system, you’d need to use digital feedback-canceling features that are self-syncing 

I have tried to build one of these, eventually settled on a double-repeat setup so it records new input while playing the second loop of the first sample and knows to subtract what’s going through the speaker from the new recording. Works wonderfully though, strongly recommend 

Edit: For everyone asking for one, I’m sorry but I already have plenty of money and no free time to make more. But here’s some goodies to start you in the right direction:

Get a “Audio Hacker” arduino DSP shield from nootropics designs. Download their sample code for a sampler. Rewrite the code to set the sample size at 0.2s and repeat twice and start recording after 0.4s after the first and so on. In order to get clean (non-feedback) recordings you need to run the output through a subtractive op amp and sync the input gate using an optoisolator (no, you can’t use a transistor because audio signals drop below 0v, just like AC). Same way they take noise out of a balanced XLR line. After that, the hardware optimization is up to you."

"I just recently read this online somewhere (probably Reddit), the book Queen Bee that the movie Mean Girls was based on goes into this.

The very top line is, boys can get away with being angry, hitting each other, etc, while girls are socialised to be 'ladylike' and not behave that way.

So when women have a grudge against each other, instead of hashing it out, they have these petty 'games' they play, or excluding certain people etc, etc.

When I was a teenager complaining about stupid teenage girl stuff my mum would always say *""It's so much easier for boys, they hit each other and it's over, but girls are mean and back-stab one another""*

I guess that kind of conditioning just continues on into some work spaces?"
I know that somewhere out there are people whose dick is so small that two of their dicks could fit inside mine and also somewhere out there are people with such huge wangs that two of my dicks could fit inside their dick and that really fucks with my head.

"As a female, I hate the whole ""man up"" mentality. Emotions are normal and natural, and men shouldn't be made to feel ashamed for feeling perfectly normal things. 

My SO used to never want to be emotional around me and I finally was like IT IS OKAY TO CRY. I don't think less of him for it and I certainly don't consider him any less of a man because of it. Burying things only causes them to compound and fester, and when the emotions finally get released it's so much more explosive. Crying, venting, etc are all very cathartic and no one should be ashamed of their emotions because of their gender."

"To be honest, every single piece of dating advice I’ve been given from a woman has been completely ass-backwards. In my experience, every woman is only going to tell you what SHE wants, and in most cases, it’s not even true, it’s really more like what she THINKS she wants, what she projects some imaginary ideal to be.

In reality, the most successful I’ve ever been is when I stopped worrying about anyone else’s advice at all (even the girl in front of me) and just did exactly what I wanted. This is when I’ve always found women being objectively interested in me."
"When I was 26 I was dating a 35 year old.  We were walking on the beach and she was telling me about the time ""17 years ago"" when she did acid for the first time. Her story was full of drug and hormone fueled debauchery.

When the story ended she asked ""you?"" and she was asking about the first time I did psychedelics. I interpreted it as what was I doing 17 years ago

""idk I was 9 so probably watching Pokémon""

She burst into tears at how old the comparison made her feel."

"Good friend of mine did. He hated his dad because he ran off on him and his mom when he was 4. His dads side of the family never gave a shit and he figured fuck that family why should I carry their name forward. Problem he never considered was sadly that tons of people behind his back thought it was a wimpy thing. Every time he brings it up more mentions it he says he feels emasculated because of how most people react. He still says it feels better than carrying his shity dads name around though, so there is that. "
Your inlaws are Outlaws?
"My appearance.

This is more the fault of pop culture than anything, but a lot of women seem to think that guys are complete slobs who only manage to clean and cloth ourselves by accident. 

If you think a guy is attractive, chances are that he has put a fair bit of thought into his look. *Especially* if his look includes stubble, touseled hair, or odd matching choices like jeans and tee shirt with a blazer. It's not quite as elaborate as women's fashion but men's fashion is still a deliberate conscious choice about how to present yourself."
This reminds me of how I tattooed a bigger member than my member on my member and the babes can't even tell. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

"The average guy gets very little positive reinforcement when our clothes look nice

Whereas if a woman’s outfit is on point, men and women alike are likely to notice and comment/compliment

"Nobody gives a fuck what I wear anyway, why should I. Unless I go to a wedding or a funeral I wear my normal cloths, which are 90% cargo pants/shorts and plain black shirts."

"From my experince (and I'm 90% sure I can find some studies to back this up if needed) women are much more judgemental on other womens clothing and general appearance than men are...


**EDIT:** Also the blatant misandry on some, more extreme, feminist circles that *some* women want to force on all the others.. (not saying all feminists hate men! Just a few, more toxic ones)"
"Woman with small boobs here. You can't fix her insecurity, but you can help by making positive comments in a non-sexual environment. Comment on how good her boobs look when they aren't all pushed up and sexy or during your handsy times. That makes a HUGE difference for any kind insecurity. Sometimes it feels forced or like you're just saying it because you're turned on, it's easy for a woman to feel like an object for sex. So, commenting on those things at the most random times will make her remember it. You don't even have to overdo it, just saying ""oh my, your boobs look so good"" when you're out shopping or doing something meaningless can help. But also remember that you can't fix her, you can only hope it helps in the long run. "
"I'm married and we have two boys.  Mortgage, cars, good job, etc.  It fucking terrifies me that my wife, right now, could decide to leave and completely fuck my life up financially and emotionally FOREVER.  I will never say this out loud, yet I feel that it is my duty as a father to instruct the boys that marriage is an outdated social contract that I cannot recommend.  FYI, I love my wife and we have a good relationship but shit changes.  

I'm just not sure how to convey this to them without fucking them up."
"I don’t know about circumcision, but it seems to me male general standards are SO much higher than female.  I have never heard men actually disparage or even comment on a weird vagina, but “I bet he has a small dick” is like a common proxy for someone of weak character.   "

"Not trying to be quirky or humblebragging at all, I was seriously curious.

I had shitty exes before who would think that I was being clingy sometimes for no reason.  Ie. Me asking how their day went would be qualified as ""too much"" and ""clingy"".  Me saying ""Good Morning"" or ""Good Night"", also clingy or suffocating.

I also tend to have anxiety where I worry about everything I do.  Especially, when I'm very interested in someone.  I will constantly second guess things that I normally do for other people if I wanted to do it for someone I really like."
"Watched this happen to so many of my friends.

It's a harsh truth. I only show weakness to my closest Bros now. Or maybe a therapist. Or an anonymous internet forum.

"I get your point, but the men I know who are successfully (numerically) with women generally have a very, very warped view of them.

The ""Great Happiness Space"" documentary illustrates this well. The successful hosts all talk about how they fabricate a dream, lie, talk about what the woman wants to hear, exert social pressure etc. to be successful.

It's dark. And the guys I know who have had a lot of girlfriends in the past have similar advice and worldviews.

You could argue of course that these guys aren't really the men who are successful with women. But that begs the question: what sort of man would you consider to be successful with women? "
"Naturally, I'm not contending men do not vent.

"Don't put her on a pedestal. All she can do is look down on you.

Also, when approaching a girl for the first time, don't ask for her number. Give her yours. You still show confidence and assertiveness, but it puts the ball in her court. Now she knows you're interested. You've done all you can. If she calls or texts you, then cool, you've got a date. If not, she would have said no anyway."

"Yes. Men are allowed to cultivate friendships with other women and no, that doesn't mean they are attracted to them. My SO and I have best friends of the opposite sex, neither of us is afraid that we're going to cheat with those friends. It's about having trust in your SO and the relationship you're building."
"View your emotions as a source of information. Like other sources of information, sometimes it tells you useful things, sometimes \(when you're too sensitive to said information\) it tells you the wrong things.

"Also much of the time, when a guy points to examples of women who ""don't wear makeup,"" the women are DEFINITELY wearing makeup, they just do it very well. The ""no makeup"" makeup look is harder to pull off than you think unless you already have clear skin and nice features. "
"This is absolutely 110% okay. You are not under any obligation to pity date a heavy individual just because the anti-fat shaming movement says you should. Obviously, being rude about it is one thing, but there is nothing wrong with politely declining anyone, for any reason. That goes for women and men alike. Physical fitness isn't just about looks - it speaks to discipline, effort and overall prioritization of health and wellness. 

I take chubby anti-fat-shamers to school about this all the time. I'm a former fat girl, and got skinny because a guy I was dating kindly mentioned that I was looking a little chubby and held me accountable to caring for myself better. We're not together anymore, but I am forever grateful for him because of it. "

"The false interpretation of feminism that believes women are superior. I think more real feminists need to stop rejecting the label because of these bad apples, because that just increases the notion that the belief in the superiority of women is what it means.

Along the same lines, this whole ""two wrongs make a right"" mentality that implies it's ok to make fun of men for being men because women were made fun of for being women for so long."
"I heard this advice, and I think it's really good. A relationship is not about how much you can get, but about how much you can give. It's sort of counter-intuitive, because you don't want a relationship that seems like too much work, but it actually works really well. If you spend some time everyday thinking of even little tiny ways to make her happy, she'll notice and you will notice that the relationship gets better too."

"I fucking hate how ""introvert"" has been coopted by people with social anxiety or laziness to justify being afraid of human interaction and not doing anything with their lives as ""normal"".

Introverts are all around you, it just means someone who doesn't gain energy from being around others and socializing.  It doesn't mean someone who is afraid to do normal aspects of daily life because it will mean talking to others or leaving their houses.  

I myself am an introvert.  If I have to socialize for more than a couple hours it makes me feel exhausted, I am a CPA and this is fucking perfect because I deal with numbers all day and while I do lots of socializing, delegating, etc. I get more than enough alone time to focus that it fits my personality.  Because my job fits my personality I'm damn good at it and am pretty successful, I consider it a strength, not a weakness.

That said, any job involves dealing with people.  I had to do job interviews, be presentable to my colleagues, delegate effectively etc.  All this stuff took deliberate learning and hard work.  I could have just said ""oh I'm an introvert I suck at that"" but I didn't and neither should anyone else."
