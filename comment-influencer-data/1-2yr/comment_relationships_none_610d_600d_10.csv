The point is that she's been shouldering the burden of most of the bills for the whole marriage so it's likely he'll try and pass this off to her as well. 
"Your adoptive parents did bad.  Even if their motives were good.

Still, what's done is done. Now is time for the therapy.

Like I said, in my country you are not allowed access to your birth parent's details until you have undergone mandatory counselling. You address precisely this question: what if they dont want to know? What if they are assholes? What do I want/hope/fear from this meeting.

Your adoptive parents  let you down by letting you contact them without having gone through a similar process

ask to do it now"
"I agree with what everyone else is saying here about setting boundaries. But here's one other suggestion that I've heard from Matt Dillahunty on 'The Atheist Experience' (edit: this is a live call-in show that's also available as a podcast and I think is also available on YouTube). Talk to your dad and say something like, ""You believe that God is all-knowing, right? [Yes]. And he speaks to each of our hearts, right? [Yes]. Then I suggest that you pray to God sincerely and ask him to show me the evidence for his existence - because if you're right, then only he knows how to convince me and change my mind. All your proselytizing is going to do is to drive a wedge between us, and cause me (and my family) to eventually cease spending time with you. You've got to put this in the hands of your God.""

If that doesn't convince him, maybe bring up that verse where Jesus talked about, ""If a village won't receive you, then dust your feet off and move along."""
"This mindset doesn’t make sense to me. Wouldn’t you rather have a job doing SOMETHING while you keep applying in your preferred field? I work in a very different field than the one I went to school for, but I have been able to be wholly financially responsible for myself since I was 21. You might find something lucrative and rewarding if you’re more open to other possibilities. "
"Your both in charge of your own laundry. So if she wants to hang dry her own stuff and you want to dry it in the dryer then fine. Husband and I decided to do this after I accidentally dried his stuff incorrectly and him with some of my stuff. 

The dishwasher stuf... yes you should be putting it away. Either way chore charts and communicate who is responsible for what chores will help."
"You also don't need to live your life according to the standards of 70 year olds. You can find a happy medium. If you own a home you should be able to host people and have speaking volume conversations on the porch without complaints. 

Obviously stuff like the cigarette butts is a problem and shouldn't happen. "
"Okay, I understand where you're coming from but do you ever think that your parents do love and care for you its just that they have another child who needs more attention due to his disability?

This is going to happen in any family to be frankly honest where there is one child who is able to support themselves and another who needs additional support. Any parent will put more attention to the child who needs more support no matter the biological beginnings or what have you.

You need to go to therapy with your parents (not biological) and discuss it in a safe environment.

In terms of your biological parents do NOT threaten them ever with releasing the information. That is incredibly inconsiderate.

Although you may think they are a happy family now can you imagine if they stayed together instead of making that decision of letting you grow up in a stable home. 9 times out of 10 they would have broken up due to them being unable to cope with bringing up a child and I can tell you right now growing up in an unstable household is a lot worse."
"But at the same time the birth parents were like 14 when she was born. They weren't even dating. And only 15+ years later did they have another kid. I could understand if they were 20 when they had her and then went on to have another kid 2 years later that it would be a major kick in the gut, but it's pretty clear that they were kids not in any position to take care of a baby and gave her up because they thought it would be best for her. Yes, there were probably ""selfish"" reasons like wanting to go to college and the like without a child, but again, they were 14/15yo! Just kids."
"I wasn't exactly furious about the seamless order, but I did ask her about it and she right away said ""it was because i was drunk""

In general we are doing okay, but we arent rich. A 70 dollar seamless order... its just weird. I didnt ask what she got"
"Is this class at the end of the 'girls day'? 

If so I'd just be like ""Sorry, I can't make it! I'll have to take off at [x time marginally before the class].""

If it's smack in the middle... honestly, I'd be tempted to just suck it up and chalk it up to 'going along with something I don't give a hoot about for the sake of my friends.' While I understand it's an MLM and a touch more annoying / morally questionable than like, IDK, going to a bar your friend prefers that you don't like as much, it's only $20, you're **definitely** not going to be able to tactfully convince her it's a pyramid scheme (she's already invested - she **will** dig her heels in) and everyone else has already agreed.

If you really truly want to decline (knowing you will likely upset her no matter how careful you are), but it's in the middle of the ""girls day,"" you can say something like: ""I'm not interested in the class, thanks for the invite! You guys have fun, I'll just pop out during the class [for lunch / to do some errands / to say hi to someone / to call my grandma / or no excuse at all]""

If they ask why you can say ""it's not my thing"" but you said elsewhere you've enjoyed essential oils... well, frankly, they might call you out and I suggest you just become a broken record and repeat the same shit in slightly different words... ""I'm not interested"" 'why not?' ""I just don't really feel like it"" etc.

I don't think it would be wrong of you do to this even though it will upset her. Like... whatever. It's not immoral. It makes perfect sense why you don't want to go. It just depends if you want to deal with the potential drama or would rather lose $20 and bite your tongue. Up to you."
"
Don't ask out coworkers.

Don't ask out teenagers.

If you ask out a girl and it isn't an enthusiastic ""yes,"" then it's a ""no.""


"
"&gt; There are a million things she does right every day

This makes it sound like you are holding her to some standard of how a girlfriend should be. Like you are judging her. 

&gt; it still makes me feel inferior

I think you are projecting. Because you judge her, you assume when she’s talking to you that she must be judging you. But she’s probably not. Because she’s not the same as you. It’s not a personal attack on you every time she voices and opinion or makes a suggestion based on her knowledge. If you’re insecure over someone taking about the aspect ratio of a TV then I think you neee therapy because that’s such a small thing it shouldn’t be hindering your relationships. 
"
"There is that saying, ""Never wrestle with a pig. You will both get dirty, but the pig likes it.""

Stop having this conversation. Stop having this fight. It's just giving fuel to her hypothesis of you which she can turn around a dish to others in your shared social circle. "
"You just smothered her with a whole bunch of crazy. Not to mention it sounds like you blamed her for a lot of things and all of this after canceling on her. 

Put yourself in her shoes. And I mean actually do that without thinking about your intentions. How do you think your actions appeared to her? What if someone who you didn't like did the same stuff to you?"
"OP said: ""We both agreed that caring for a child with down syndrome would probably be too much for the both of us to handle."" The ""probably"" does not suggest to me that his wife swore a blood oath she's now breaking, it suggests to me exactly what he followed it up with: she told him what she thought she'd probably want to do, but she had a change of heart on an extremely difficult, personal choice it's hard to accurately guess your feelings about in advance.

I absolutely agree it's a shitty situation for them both, but there's just nothing in the post to suggest his wife lied or misled him."

"Rarely, if ever, drinks? He's 17, he shouldn't be drinking at all."
"He seems really invested in you being broken in some way.

If he can't drop the subject, I'd drop him. You shouldn't have to work this hard to prove that you're okay to some guy who's only known you for 4 months."
Seamless is a food delivery app. No drinks. She spent $70 on take-out. 
"When I was 17 I was at the pet shop with my mum. They were doing snakes at the time and she spots them and says 'hey do you want a snake?' before I can even answer she grabs one of th assistants and has him get the snake all packaged up for me and a bunch of equipment from the shop. 

I was so confused and had no idea what I was doing, but apparently I had to take care of it. My mum thought they were cool and ended up getting 7 more that I had to take care of. 

It was awful and now I'm known as the snake lady. Don't buy pets for people without talking about it first.  "
"""Hmmmm. Let's wait and see if he does something even more inappropriate. Then we'll decide if we let things go further.""

"&gt;I know she's been horny all this time, 

This is kind of an odd thing to say. Your wife was 24 and you were 36 when you got together nine years ago. People do a lot of maturing in that time, and it makes me wonder if this paranoia is new or a response to her starting to express her needs. 

“You never call me beautiful” is not weird snapping out of nowhere. It’s a very specific issue and you dismiss it outright. "
"Yup. The time for these kinds of ""jokes"" is over. Put your foot down on this case and just say ""no"" to this kind of stuff. Like they really don't have anything more clever to say? Shame on them. "

"I realize you are freaked out that CPS is involved again, but you’ve done the right thing. 

If it helps ease your mind, my parents are foster parents and have been for almost 29 years. They welcome new children all the time and make sure they have a warm, loving home. It’s not as bad as television shows make it out to be.  That doesn’t mean there aren’t horrible people out there who are foster parents, but you hear a lot more about the bad ones than the good ones. 

If having him at your place is an option, they will likely go with that or an aunt or uncle who are willing. A foster home would be a last resort. "

"But not all. I think OP's counselor is one of the exceptions, especially if they haven't picked up on OP's wife's anxiety and addressed it."

I think you should tell her how you feel about it. Ask to meet her up for lunch or something. Then ask her out if you really do think y’all would be a good couple. 
"Sounds a bit like resource guarding and prey drive. Very common in a lot of dogs and I'm sorry to hear it escalated to this point.


I don't think your dog is necessarily dangerous but they definitely shouldn't live with small animals ever again. I would be cautious with young children more than usual, but you don't have to completely isolate your dog from them.


I see in another comment that you've mentioned that your dog doesn't like certain behaviors. Please stop anyone young or old doing those behaviors. Some dogs tolerate it forever while others don't and eventually escalate. You don't want to figure out the hard way which one describes your dog.



As for your boyfriend, well, I can see from his perspective as well as yours. It's a hard call: Some camps say get rid of the dog, others say keep the dog. But possibly keeping the dog will end your relationship. You need to decide where your priorities are and how much you want this dog.


If you decide to surrender, try to find a foster rescue and tell them EVERYTHING. Being a cat killer with resource guarding issues doesn't mean your dog isn't adoptable. It just means they need to be placed in a specific type of home.


I think you should have a talk with your boyfriend about where to go from here. You seem intent on keeping your pup, so you need to hash that out with your boyfriend. Would he feel better if you called a behaviorist to look at the dog? Would grief counseling help? Is there any common ground you two can find that includes the dog living with you?


Finally, you are in the right in regards to punishing the dog. They will have no idea what you're so upset about. A behavior needs to be corrected while it's happening in order to be effective OR no more than a few seconds after the behavior occurs. I understand your boyfriend is grieving for their lost friend, but punishing the dog will not help. He could yell at the dog, smack the dog, put the dog outside for the night, etc, and it will not bring the cat back nor will it teach the dog not to kill cats.

"
You don't socialize with someone who disrespects your relationship unless that someone means more to you than your relationship.
"That’s just not true. I know a fair bit about animal training, and OP seems to have well researched the issue. "
"&gt; because he's not a violent or aggressive dog outside of this and any dog is capable of doing what he did. 

Just to be clear this is absolutely false. I am a husky owner. If my husky catches *a wild rabbit* outside and I tell her to drop it or intervene in any way - she lets it go unscathed. 

Your dog is violent and aggressive and you need a reality check stat. "
"He is annoyed by your frequent questioning. You guys are getting so caught up in whether or not to define that as controlling when really, you need to be making a compromise. Neither of you is wrong or right. You would like to know what he’s doing and who he’s with all day and he finds that stifling.

You guys need to sit down together and find a compromise. Maybe you can text him once in the morning to get a brief overview of his day so that he doesn’t feel overwhelmed. Maybe you can work something else out that will work for both of you.

You both need to be willing to compromise here. "
If you truly empathized with your boyfriend at all this wouldn’t even be a reddit post.
"I see why you don’t  want to get rid of your dog. Obviously. But even when you are claiming to be sensitive and sympathetic you still have to slide in that it was his mistake to uncrate your dog.

Just leave that out for a moment and focus on making your boyfriend your priority. He might be more willing to move forward if he doesn’t feel so alone. "
"This is the kind of language used in bodice ripper novels to talk around sex, and OP seems uncomfortable having a frank and direct conversation about it. There's also references to ""his friend had me,"" ""they were both messing with me,"" and she even self-censored ""fuck."" It just sounds like someone that has no idea how to talk about sex, which is not a person that should continue to put themselves in this situation."
"&gt; Girlfriend is deal hunter. I prefer convenience. 

Convenience costs money. Your girlfriend is smart and she knows this already and that's why you have debt and she doesn't. It's that simple. If you're Canadian, you should know who Gail Vaz-Oxlade is. If you don't, check out her book ""Money Rules."" You're breaking several of them with your bad habits. She'd probably call you a money moron and advise your girlfriend to choose a better partner. As it stands, you're not financially compatible and it's going to cause her a lot of headache. "
"I think this is an extremely important point; Huskies do have a huge prey drive, but it can be controlled with training. This one wasn't. Moreover, if you have an animal known to have a strong prey drive that hasn't been trained with a very strong 'leave it' as yours has, why the *hell* would you introduce it to a household with another, smaller animal?"
"I will preface this by saying that I am childfree-by-choice and have been aware that's who I am for a long time now.

It doesn't sound to me like your wife wants to be a Mom again, it doesn't seem like she's been super-enjoying it the first time around, and she resents this situation.  She was getting along okay with one kid - she had accepted her role - but now she's watching her dreams being flushed even further down the toilet by adding a second child to the mix.  Have you asked her if she even wants this baby?  Maybe you can start there."
"That’s understandable. She really respects her brother’s opinion about things like this. My fear is that she’ll see his reaction, and in an attempt to preserve my friendship with him, she will just cut us off. "

So what extra details would complicate the narrative of someone *beating their partner*? I hope you're not trying to imply she somehow deserved it or pushed him into beating her.
"  This is classic alcoholic behavior.  Addicts have little to zero impulse control and the worst part, they are aware of the ramifications, however the ramifications are as easily rationalized by them as your rationalization of tolerating him putting you in the middle. 

He may kill or maim you one day.  Please go have a look at photos and stories of people involved in violent auto accidents.  Ask yourself if you’re willing to live the rest of your life with a prosthetic leg or two.  Be willing to face a lifetime of corrective surgeries and physical therapy.  I realize this is scare tactic thinking and you’ll likely just phffft the possibility.  Maybe we all face that possibility, you have much, much higher chances of visiting a trauma center then if you had a boyfriend who didn’t drink and drive. 

That and you haven’t even faced the prospect of life living with an addict. Go attending an AlAnon meeting or two.  Get the scoop on the living hell you have volunteered for and are now defending.  Good luck. You will most definitely need it in your lifetime with this guy.   "

"He’s a militant atheist whose anger and bitterness in life is reflected through his “hate” of religion and his self-professed “lust for logic” or whatever he tells himself at night to convince himself that he’s better than you and everyone else.

He’s just as bad as Westboro Baptist and all the other fundamentalist jerks of all types out there.

Yes, atheism, especially his kind, is just as much of a religion and worldview as Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc. 

Also, you’re on a spiritual journey yourself. If you “find God”, don’t “find God”, or anything and everything in between - while you’re attending mass.... then that’s your spirituality at stake. It’s great that you find peace and calm and solace in church. The fact that you’re keeping an open mind and he is not - I think, shows who the bigger person is in this scenario."

"You probably aren't going to have a relationship with their kids anyway OP, sorry. Even if you become BFF's with Laura, Jim is still going to sabotage any relationship you have with her and their children. He's going to do what he can do to keep you away. 

Text Laura, ""Jim has never liked me -this has never been more clear since I moved to CITY, and he has ignored every single effort I make to reach out to the two of you, then spread lies trying to justify himself. For whatever reason, he doesn't want me around. I wish you two the best, but I'm done trying with him."" 

Go to your friend's wedding, tell your mom you don't want to hear about Jim, and consider yourself an only child. Best part about being an adult is choosing who you have to interact with. "

"&gt; It may be judgmental or immature or wrong but god, it has been bothering me so much. And I wish it didn't. I tried to get over it but it's eating at me.

I think if it bothers you then it bothers you and you are right to call off the relationship.

FWIW I disagree with the majority view on this subreddit that you can't judge people for relationship compatibility by the number of sexual partners they've had.  That goes for both men and women.  I would not want to get involved with a guy who 'stopped counting at 50' either.

Especially when you factor in the lies he told, I think you made a sensible decision.

Good luck for your future relationships."
"But, how difficult is it to plan seeing a film? To book a restaurant table? "
"Don't listen to this ""not a planner"" nonsense? No functioning adult can be unable to plan. He probably just doesn't like planning dates and has been enjoying having it all done for him. A classic passive aggressive tactic is to get out of doing something you don't want to do by ""trying"" and being incompetant at it. Thats what I see happening here. He's not happy with taking on more responsibility for the relationship so, rather than say that, he's trying to sabotage it in the hope that you give up and go back to being the organiser. Relationships require basic maintenance and that can't all be down to one person. If he's not willing to step up then you would be better off leaving."
This is why you don't give keys to people. Locks are your friend.
"This was a problem early on in my relationship as well and sone of it still lingers on (see my post) - driving me nuts sometimes.


When we spend quality time together (even if it is just chilling on the couch and watching netflix), my SO mutes his phone or doesn't pick up/clicks it away.


He still has problems telling people he is occupied and sometimes listens to their s#it for a couple of minutes, but it has gotten a lot more better.


I would try not to be confrontational but appeal to him like this: ""the time with you is valuable, you have so little of it and you'd like to enjoy it to the fullest. Interruptions spoil the time."" Ask him to ""be 100% there"" for the time you planned for you (2 episodes of  series, dinner, 1 hour of chilling)...


Sometimes, we ban mobile phones from our datenights. Never looked back. :) "
"Definition for enamored
&gt;affected by strong feelings of love, admiration, or fascination

You can still love someone and find them boring. It happens all the time. You can still admire boring people. You can still find boring people fascinating.  

Point is someone can be boring in the sense that they aren't adventurous or stick to the same routine. Relationships get boring. They have both exciting periods and boring periods. It's part of it. 

OP here has found a new guy that she finds exciting. The thing is most people will find new people they meet exciting. After a while those people will start to seem boring. You then get in this cycle where you find new and exciting people, they then get boring and repeat.

OP isn't finding the new guy exciting she is finding that learning about this new person is exciting. Two very different things.  I love to meet new people and this is why. The act of meeting new people to me is exciting even if the people that I meet aren't."

"I'm not saying deep and dark secrets, just normal stuff that's deeper than small talk. Like where do you see your career going, or what do you want out of a relationship? OP left it pretty vague with:

"I said it elsewhere but man, you are taking this WAY too personally.

Nobody is being mean to you. Your boyfriend doesn't understand why it hurts you because it makes no sense. You need to manage your own emotions. Not your boyfriend.

I think this sounds the most reasonable and plausable response to our situation. But it continues to make me feel like the parent with another kid.

"My husband was in a similar situation. His best friend (female) was getting married to a known controlling abuser after dating a short time. My husband told her straight up he could not attend their wedding because he did not support her marrying this man. She and many of his friends gave him a lot of shit about not being there for her, how could he do/say such a thing, etc. Husband and best friend didn’t speak for over a year. She finally reached out to him after separating from her now ex-husband who became physically abusive. She thanked him for being her only true friend at the time. We are all very close again and she is now married to a wonderful man. Point is, you can probably expect some painful fall out, but in the long run “being there” and “supporting” your best friend may mean letting her know you don’t endorse her marrying this guy. "
"I just don’t understand why you care if she’s mad at you?? Pulling her hair because she was literally on top of your boyfriend is something 99.8% of people would probably do in that situation. She is the one who caused any and all drama stemming from this because she made the choice to sexually assault her friends boyfriend! You need to tell your friends what happened, they would probably want to have the choice not to be friends with a gross human like her, I mean if any of them are in relationships they should know so that they don’t leave her alone with their SOs.  Once again, why do you care if she’s mad or what she thinks? She clearly doesn’t care about you or your relationship if this is what she’s doing and hasn’t even apologized. "

He hasn’t had contact with her in 7 years and he’s finally getting to reconnect, and he wants to share his excitement with the people that are close to him, e.g. you and your sister. He probably doesn’t realise that you two haven’t warmed up to her the way he has and might feel that you are as excited as he is? Just a guess.

But I think if you want him to tone it down a bit maybe have a quiet chat with it about him when he hasn’t been talking about her for a bit or trying to tell you something about her because if you tell him to tone it down / stop after he’s just said something about her he might feel like you’re trying to shut him down and don’t want to listen to him.

Good luck with it all!"
"Keep in mind that oxytocin makes people trust people who are otherwise untrustworthy. You were cuddling him while you had this conversation, so it's natural that you'd be calm and collected about the whole thing, but he may be lying to you. Keep your guard up."
"I have to disagree.  OP is an adult and owes no one an explanation for changing her locks or ensuring privacy.  

The very fact that MIL has a key and uses it without notice is due to OP and husband not making a fuss or asserting their domain.  Change the locks and if she asks about it again, look her in the eye and tell her: ""we don't appreciate being walked in on or having our private lives become your Facebook like factory"".  You'll have to knock like every other person already knows"".  "

That's a really good point. I already know he is a problem just waiting to happen. I need to pull the plug now before it starts.
"I didn't mean to suggest otherwise. She didn't do anything *very* risky, but it seems like she also didn't do anything that would reliably lead to personal wealth (besides marrying a rich guy). For instance, she quit school, worked low-paying jobs, was content with very little, traveled a lot, presumably didn't have a lot of long-term savings or investments, etc. Granted, she did go back to school later, but I have a feeling her job prospects still wouldn't have garnered the sort of wealth that's making OP's wife jealous now. 

Things fell into Mia's lap to give her riches beyond what she ""deserved"" or ""worked for""—from OP's wife's perspective, at least. That's the lottery of life. Mia won that lottery *seemingly* not by her own personal ambition or hard work, but simply through marriage. That can seem unfair to someone who's worked hard their whole life for much less. It stings. 

What I meant by Mia winning a gamble was that, through her actions, she risked not being well-off in her later years (due to the sort of work she did, and her lack of ambition in a traditional sense), she risked never meeting an AMAZING guy (sometimes people hold out for better and never find it), she risked being alone forever (and was okay with that), etc. This wasn't the sort of person you'd expect to become fabulously wealthy. She gambled and won in the lottery of life.

"
Ding ding ding! This!
Probably a drunken mistake. Let it be.
"My thoughts:

1. Gage sucks, block, avoid, move on etc.  You're already on top of that one.

2. Your friends antagonising and making up rumours about Gage is kinda 'mean girl' behaviour.  It kinda makes them shitty friends.  They should just ignore him too.

3. Regarding Gabby, I would generally ignore her.  If you're ever talking to her low key one on one, maybe ask her if she's been tested since going out with Gage, since he gave you an STD."
"Yeah, but this sounds like renting a hall/space and getting catering, then asking people to pay for it. That's weird. "
Unless you want to lose your job and the respect of anyone that works there let it go. You came in at the tail end of a conversation a dad was having about his daughter. None of this is your business and you don't know their family dynamic.
"Apologize, like, yesterday.    I’m not trying to be mean here, but I think you probably broke your dad’s heart."
"Honestly? I'd lower contact with your friend too. No one in their right mind would stay with someone like that guy. If that had been me, I would have immediately demanded his phone and checked through every fucking account I could find because bullshit he wasn't taking pictures. 

It's crazy that she's believing this lie of it not being sexual and kinda fucking dismissing how traumatizing that was for you. 

Like, great, she's taking away his ""temptation"" because that'll fix everything. Meanwhile, you endured hours of psychological terror, not knowing if you were about to be attacked in your best friend's home or not. 

And the very best she's going to offer is a ""well, I won't bring him around you anymore""??? How fucked up is that? That's not friend behavior.

So now you're left to pick up the slack alone. Tell your friends just in case she didn't. Tell them *exactly* what happened. Make it well known that this man is NEVER to be around you. Let your group watch out for each other. 

Limit your time around your other friend. You don't need to hear about her boyfriend anymore. He's not a topic for discussion.

You don't have to accept an apology. Maybe consider seeing a counselor or therapist because this was a pretty terrible thing to go through and talking through it might help you.

"
"An awful lapse in judgment? He repeatedly preyed on a sleeping woman, coming back over and over during the night to pull blankets off of her, gape, shine lights, take pictures (don't buy the lie that he didn't), and try to see her not fully clothed. For hours. Multiple times. It was a repeated, focused, persistent attempt to violate her. You are minimizing this so much I wonder if you even read the original post. "
"Agreed.. I know girls who have stayed with guys for sending texts to other girls or drunkenly making out with a girl, that’s so so hard to get over in terms of trust - but this is next level he tried to take advantage of an unconscious girl"
"&gt; Did you thank your friend for being honest with you? It's horrific that you should have to, but she really endangered your affection for her by being willing to tell the truth, here--I hope you know she's precious.

Please see this OP -- this is a friend for life."
"You did the right thing calling the cops. Anyone that tells you otherwise is wrong. His Mom is trying to guilt you by saying he could lose his job- well better her son lose his job than his life. They are misdirecting their emotions towards you, but you have to know that what you did may have absolutely saved his life. Don't focus on what other people are saying. This is tough for someone in your position to go through and it's okay to seek help for *yourself* right now to cope with all of this. "

"Exactly, ""drunk"" is no excuse. It's the easy way out for assholes. Irresponsible idiot assholes to top it off. I'd wonder how often he's done this with people TS doesn't know personally. And I'd wonder about anything in the future where TS doesn't hear from her SO for a few hours or so. Nothing will be the same anymore. ""Working late"" turns into ""might be cheating"" and ""going to the bar"" turns into ""soliciting sex with strangers"".

This is so sad :("
"When she's mad there's a lot of yelling, when she's really mad she'll break things. I just never know how to deal with it and everything I do is wrong. She doesn't listen to reason when she is angry and says mean shit and then later on say she didn't mean it. These days I actually do just ignore it and not do anything, since I'm tired of it and anything I do will be wrong anyway so what's the point. 


She does work regular 9-5 hours. I leave for work an hour before her (she wakes up at the same time as me) and usually get home before her as well, although this past week I've been working OT. I would say that she doesn't have any hobbies, but she/we see her friends more than I see mine. My close friends don't live in the area and also my gf doesn't like them."
"Don't forget...

5) If she's being truthful about the father of those kids being in prison in Russia, you'll also get to deal with him being quite angry with you when he gets out, and Russian prisons tend not to bring out the touchy-feely side of inmates."

"This is beyond your wife wanting you to be present in your relationship and not get sucked into gaming. This is straight up controlling and it's not okay.

You need to have an adult conversation about this because her behavior is out of line."
"*Yeah...* A monogamous person would tell their partner honestly that they want to experiment and possibly try an open relationship out of respect for their partner, and the terms of the monogamous relationship that they originally established and agreed to.

This is just a cheater. I am sympathetic to his anxiety about coming out as non-heteronormative, but he could have simply explained it as being confused about what he needs sexually, and wanting to try an open relationship and also explaining that he wants to keep certain struggles to himself until he figures everything out.

There are definitely ways that one can be monogamous *and* be respectful to their partner if they want to see or be intimate with other people. This is completely disrespectful."
"A lot of women can't orgasm from only PIV, and need stimulation to their clit or other ways. It's not something that is wrong with you or just your problem. Your husband should be making the effort to give you orgasms. You definitely deserve that. "
Because he might say no and that's scary!
"&gt;yeah, I have a deep understanding of the current cultural climate

"I'm going to differ here: sounds to me like your wife is LITERALLY ""settling-in"". You know when women tease, ""Oh, I'm married now. I don't have to: 1. dress-up, 2: wear as much make-up, etc.""  She appears to be trying to fit into a mold of ""married wife"" she has heard of, watched on tv or observed in marriages in her lifetime.  

The ""that's not respectable"" line suggests she does not want to be seen as a harlot/ wild since she is now married. You can ask her if that is how she feels/ thinks and then re-assure her that you love her as she were.  No judgment from you and you are not looking for a Stepford-wife.  

At the same time, consider that marriage -life is new. She maybe trying to find her rhythm in it all and may feel comfortable enough to try small personality adjustments. Over all, I see a woman totally happy with just you and her in a little corner of the world. She is making her home and no longer wants/ needs the external stimulation. Her focus is on home. That's kind of amazing actually. :)  

Best of luck!  "
"Agreed and also, don't let them guilt you!  

All the work they've put in to raise you?  That's the bare minimum expected of parents.  They *chose* to have you.  That includes feeding, clothing, educating etc. you.  You don't owe them for that.

As u/Fitzwilliger said, there will always be a reason for you to give them money.  You need to start the precedent that you are *not* their bank.  All their bad decisions have led to this point.  They are adults who can deal with the consequences.  It's not your fault and you should not enable them trying to avert the unpleasant results of a life of gambling and irresponsibility.

You've earned that trip.  Go and enjoy it guilt free."
"It's good that you realize this is fucked up. This is the way that cultures destroy the mobility of women: Make them so their sexuality is the only thing about them that is valued, then dictate who they can express their desire toward, and finally, humiliate them if they try to act with independence. You and your family are part of the problem.

I understand that you do not feel strongly enough to step outside of your cultural norms, but when people talk about how cultures are oppressive to women, this is what they mean."
She probably doesn't want to have someone 'willing' to be monogamous with her. She wants someone who **wants** monogamy with her.
Don’t let her brush it off. Ask what’s funny? Ask exactly how that would be a joke? Give your mom or any other family consequences if they brush you off. No one is going to stand up for you besides yourself. 
Fuck that. That is a major red flag.
"Plus the top comment on that original post is some bullshit about how feelings can't be immature. 

Feelings can damn well be immature. Crying because someone didn't want to have sex with you right then and there is really fucking immature.

It's normal to be young and have irrational fears and immature reactions, but that needs to be a valuable learning moment, not an opportunity for more coddling. 

Good on them for talking it out, but jesus this sub sometimes. "
"Yeah, he's basically robbed her of the chance to go into her wedding with 100% awesome, positive, un-complicated feelings.  I got married pretty recently and the couple days before were logistic chaos, but emotionally I was on cloud 9 - just totally thrilled and so excited for what we were about to do.  He took that from her - even if she has no romantic interest in him, she still is going to think about him and what he said *on her wedding day*.  Maybe she'll wonder if she led him on, or what would have happened if they'd dated when they were 16.  Totally unfair, unnecessary, and totally selfish."
I would also take a Screenshot of it and ask her to explain herself. Then she can't be denying it if the photo mysteriously gets deleted 
"OP you also mention she's struggling with depression but won't go to therapy. OP, I suffer from mental illness that makes me kinda cray sometimes, but I take medication and go to therapy. I also often have intrusive thoughts about snooping on my SO for no real reason. I would never ever ever ever ever do what your girlfriend has done. She is using her mental health to manipulate you into putting up with her behavior. There is absolutely no reason you need to stay and deal with this. She will not change, going to therapy together will only make things worse, and the more you give in to her the bolder and more controlling she will get. Run, don't walk, away from this before she assaults you again."
"It's pretty much the plot of Made of Honor, but with less castles , horseback riding, and kilts...

Seriously, OP, follow this advice. It's entirely possible this guy could pull some wedding-day-ruining stunt on the day you want to remember fondly, not as ""The day Ned got drunk and 'toasted' to my marriage, saying if I ever wanted to cheat on Bill, he'd be around..."""
"Harsh but true. Thanks, I will talk to him about how I'm feeling. Maybe I'll just send him this post since I already summed everything up..."
"I’m so sorry for your loss.  I’m guessing that your sister wants to escape the toxic, dysfunctional family environment and this is an easy way to do this.  You even say yourself your parents are unhappy and stressed and are being forced to live together.  Your sister has had major emotional problems and has acted out in the past.  Getting away from this environment will be good for her.

I know you want to keep everyone together and for everyone to get along, but you can’t force that to happen.  I feel so sad for you that you feel responsible for the family harmony and for fixing all the problems.  That’s not your job.  Your parents should be the ones doing this, but they’re too wrapped up in their own problems for that.  

You can’t fix this.  Don’t try to control your sister or control her relationship with her parents.  If you asked her, I’m positive she will say that getting away from her current situation, even with the threat of death, is better than staying.  So let her go and stop trying to control her.  You can’t control your family environment, you can’t control other adults’ choices, so please stop trying and let her find her path. 

Be there for her.  Give her advice.  Support her emotionally.  But *let her make her own choices*.  Be there for her in good times and bad.  Your parents haven’t done this for her but you can if you choose.  Encourage her to find her own way.  

Your parents’ emotional health and marriage is also not your responsibility, so please stop trying to control that as well.  I know you think that if you can just glue everyone together that everything will be fine, but it doesn’t work that way.  I think you need to let go of being responsible for your parents’ mental health as well, because you can’t fix other adults, and that’s not your job anyway.

I think some counseling for you would be a very, very good idea.  What you’re doing is well-intentioned, and I know you love your family and want them all to be ok, but by trying to control everyone around you, you’re only contributing to the dysfunction instead of fixing it.  Read up on codependence, it’s very common with kids who grow up in dysfunctional situations.  Get some help for yourself to learn to let go of control and build your own life.  When was the last time you thought about *your* wants and needs, *your* mental health, *your* emotional safety ?  Some therapy might help you.  Good luck."
"Look, I'm not from your culture. But you can't blame 'culture' for everything. You made choices. You chose to stay in a relationship you could have realized probably wouldn't last.

You didn't have to tell her you didn't trust her. You could have chosen to end it using your family's lack of approval as an excuse (which isn't inaccurate). Your decisions hurt her, and you may not have been able to change the ending, but you could have changed how you got there."
"This! I see so many posts ITT saying, oh, the friends just thought hiding the trip would be kinder. But there's no way the friends reasonably could've thought OP *wouldn't* find out about it - especially when the entire rest of the group didn't show up for their weekly Friday meetup *because they were off skiing*.

This was a very shitty thing for your friends to do, OP. Not claiming to be a relationship expert, but in your position I'd definitely talk to the folks in the group in private. And I'd seriously consider downgrading how much time/energy I invested in the group going forward."
"Not only is he not her friend, but a term that people often use here is that he is not a friend to their marriage. He is an enemy to their marriage. She has to put her foot down, uninvite him, tell her husband, and start this marriage off on the right foot."
"It's odd that he knew you were uncomfortable with the scenes to the point of stopping the movie and then started the movie explicitly to watch those scenes with you? That's a lot of pressure. In the future, shut that down right away instead of running away. You don't need to be comfortable watching those scenes right now. He can respect that. 

In the meantime, tell your therapist about this. Keep being diligent with your exercises. Hopefully it will improve with time and effort. "
"Everyone is telling you what you don’t seem to want to accept: that regardless of your personal thoughts about this relationship between your boyfriend and your mother, he is doing something that upsets your father, and he needs to stop doing that. 

If he can show this intense amount of respect and care and consideration for your mother, he should be able to provide that same level of consideration to your father. Respect a man in his home. That’s simple."
"You haven't *lived* until you've been finger blasted to ""Sail Away."""
Ha! Agreed but that last bit made me guffaw. 
"Her bad behavior? Her fiance and the father of her child was murdered three weeks ago. So yeah, we’re going to excuse her “bad behavior”. What her sister said was cruel beyond measure."
"I'm not buying he excuse about the flash either. I mean, come on.

Even if I tapped flashlight on/off as fast as possible you'd never emulate a flash"
"&gt; I think she's purposefully not reaching out to you, and waiting for you to come to her, because then she wins.

That's probably true.  I need to realize this. Thank you for your thoughtful reply.  "
You *live* with his family but he doesn't understand your connection to your family? That's kind of shocking. 
"Agree, and say it so others can hear! He's gotten away with being rude, dismissive, and boundary-crossing too long"
Dude this guy is a jerk. He tarnishes himself by speaking to you that way. 
"Pffft. How could those two behemoths help anyone in their state? You need to learn how to deal with the prospect of conflict because if you don't, you'll be a regular here, pleading for help for something that could be so easily avoided by having a spine. Just sayin'."
Does she have candles or incense around that you can see? I don't think foundation can cause the whole house to smell like that.
"If someone I know had just lost their partner and found out they were pregnant in the same two months, I wouldn't expect anything out of them for about a year. I'd understand that they're grieving and they're going to be a sloppy, sad, irrational, forgetful mess. In her sister's shoes, regardless of infidelity or even past sibling rivalry, I would sit with my sister and hold her hand while she cried, and tell her how excited I was that our kids would grow up together. The OP is grieving, frightened and alone right now. She didn't mean to burst into tears, that's just what happens when you're going through a situation like this.

Please don't compare infertility to losing the person you were going to spend your life with. There are options to mitigate infertility (and it sounds like her sister found one that worked), but not death. Also, the content of those texts, if verbatim (and it looks like they are given the name redactions) is wildly unhinged and cruel no matter the context. The OP should feel within her rights to show their mother, because the last thing she needs is to be going through this on her own. Just reading about her situation broke my heart, but reading her sister's words was gut wrenching. Words like are never called for, no matter how disappointed or upstaged you feel, or no matter how much you've suffered in the past."
T9 texting was the bomb. Thanks for this unexpected nostalgia trip.
"This is where you uninvite him from the wedding and block him from your life. Before anyone jumps at me for being too harsh, the man had a decade to tell her, and chose two days before her *wedding*. That's absolutely horrible. It's manipulative, and hurtful, and honestly OP, let's just all be glad that he didn't do it at the wedding itself (this is why you uninvite him - so you don't give him a chance to do that, as he sounds like the kind of guy who would do that). Don't forget to tell your husband, and if you have security at the wedding notify them, or the owners of the venue that they are not to let him inside."
"That's not really accurate. I had a cat and a greyhound. Once early on the greyhound attacked and would have killed the cat if the cat hadn't managed to escape. (The cat escaped, the two were never meant to be in the same room so early on). After several months the two were close enough we could leave them alone together and the cat would usually sleep on the dog.

Dogs instinctively go for smaller animals in their space. They can be trained and acclimated. Writing the dog off as a killer is unfair but they should never have been left alone together so early on."

"There are two things that might be helpful to remember here.

• Mark might ask you to keep his confidence, but you are not automatically obligates to do so. Especially as this is causing major issues in your friendship with Patty and keeping his confidence only makes it more difficult.

• Mark is trying to hurt Patty. Even if he has proof of his claim, he is only saying it and only saying it now to hurt Patty. That it was your first instinct that he was lying to get back at Patty, that he puts you in such a bad situation and tries to limit your methods of dealing with it, that this isn’t the first time he’s done this, and that he’s known as an habitual liar is all good reasons to doubt his motivations and truthfulness.

Those two things supercede Marks request that you protect his relationship with Patty. So talk to her!

Talking about this with Patty (and try for more of an discussion than confrontation) is to only conflict resolution here and only way for you to move past that. Mark is not a good enough reason to give that up. Especially concidering how bad a friend he’s being to both you and Patty."
"&gt; I guess I’m wondering how to process all of these emotions I’m dealing with, and move past this. I know it’s not fair to my bf to be angry with him when we’ve decided to stay together, but I’m just having a hard time. 

Op you are a real glutton for punishment. Read up on the sunk cost fallacy, have some self respect and dump this fool of a bf."
"Your bf has allowed a friend of six months to cause problems in your relationship of 10 years. Think about that.

This girl is only going to be in his life for another 6 months but his relationship needs for her are apparently more important than your relationship together. 

Every time you communicated your discomfort / fears / concerns, he dismissed it and prioritised a rando's friendship.

Does that objectively sound like a man in love? Does it sound like someone who is loyal and committed to spending the rest of his life with you? His actions say no. 


Forget about the girl. If it wasn't her, it would have been someone else. The truth is something is off. About his feelings towards you and about your relationship. That's what you should be focusing on.

If he loved, respected and saw the rest of his life with you, he would have put your well being first. But he didn't.

You sound keen to blame the other girl. She owes you nothing. She is not in a relationship with you. He is. Your boyfriend is *responsible* for what happened. 100%.

If he does not acknowledge that then you will be wasting your time staying with him."
She's being this combative over talking about using YOUR money. How many more red flags do you need before you realize this isn't a healthy relationship 
"So he really, really doesn’t get that he was doing something fucked up and disrespectful to you OR he just doesn’t care. He probably will go fuck her the moment you guys break up. Do you REALLY think this dude is good for you still or are you just holding on because it’s been a decade? People can grow up together or apart. Sounds like your boyfriend has barely grown up at all."
"Married to a contractor who also hates bringing in other professionals unless he trusts them.  This story is unfortunately common.  That house is a mess because it makes your FIL happy to have projects.  It will never get done.  Stop fighting with your wife now.  Simply put the house on the market as it when the time comes and another contractor will buy it and finish it.

If she wants to buy it and finish it herself at that point, the BANK will be the bad guy...not you."
"Your poor kid.

"you are correct, generally there is no such thing as too much lube. make sure the lube (and condoms) don't contain spermicide, that is also something people can be allergic to."
Wish I knew. I have never given her any rules. I didn't think a spouse should do such a thing.
"This is too true. I dated a girl for 3 years and new since the 3rd month she was abusive but I kept thinking ""she is probably the hottest girl I will ever date so I should stick it out."" Not the best decision I've ever made. "
"I think you're also not alone. I remember reading some study when Oprah was on and doing reunions, that most of these don't end up in the happy column. There's a lot of build up on both sides, for different reasons. It's hard in general when you're in your late teens through early twenties, even if you have attentive parents you can feel misunderstood. Please don't feel alone in this. 
I think it's a mature decision to speak with your health center and find a way to navigate this part of growing up.  "
"Serge lang, a brilliant mathematician, didnt believe aids was real and basically ran himself out of the math community for constantly passing out 'dossiers' containing 'evidence' it was fake. At one point he would only speak at conferences regarding math if he could also be alotted equal time to speak on how fake aids is. He was seriously legit at math too. I thought this was hilarious and brought it up to a cool professor during my undergrad in math, laughing as i explained lang's ridiculous position. Imagine my surprise when my professor proceeded to debate me about whether or not aids is real... he was on lang's side. And that guy was legit smart as well. Sometimes these things happen to even the most scrupulous and intelligent people. I mean mathematicians are like the fathers of logic and reasoning, and even within our community you can find these nuts."
"OK, then I think that explains why you're getting so much pushback from your friends. But, as we all know, freezing when something shocking happens to a person is quite common. Can you explain that to your friends?"
"You honestly sound lazy. I don't think she's so much as bossing you around as expecting you to act like an adult. Cleaning a house that two people live in once a month is gross.  Keeping all your dishes in the dishwasher and cleaning them every night is just.... dumb. If you get a plate at 8 pm how do you know if it's clean or not?  Are you putting plates that had raw chicken next to clean plates that you later use?  That's gross.  You have cabinets for a reason.  

As for decorating, your house doesn't so much sound minimalist and modern as it does just sparse and barren. You sound pretty bitter about her pillows and I would imagine that shows. You may own it but she lives there too and needs to feel that way. You talk about compromising which is great but you also make it very, very clear you would prefer not to have her stuff there.  I'm sure she can catch on to that as well."

"It’s not just the risks he subjected you to - it’s what a LIAR he is. He said it was a misunderstanding?? No, he got caught in a lie and was trying to talk his way out of it. He lies so much he can’t keep his lies straight. And then he tries to turn it around on you and gets angry as a defense?

Run, don’t walk, away from this guy. "
"Your mom is probably right in her decision. Even if your sister can support her and the baby, that’s not a fair thing to put on someone. Not to mention because of your mom’s age there is a much higher chance for birth defects and disabilities. 
I’m sure this decision was hard for your mom. "
This is exactly why anytime someone tells me they want a pet fish I tell them fish are the most exhausting pets to care for. My parents bought me betas a couple times growing up and it just stressed me out. Without a lot of money and education you're just subjecting the fish to abuse until they die. 
"Most depressed people have less enjoyment of sex or anything really so I think what compelled him to cheat was being an asshole, not his depression."
Why would it be okay if he did this when he drinks? You said you’re not normalizing the abuse but you literally said “it’s normal for a 17 year old kid to have one bad night here or there with alcohol.” Getting drunk as a 17 year old is one thing. I’ve been there. Getting drunk and committing assault (which is what this is) is another thing.

Not like this. This isn’t a “whoopsie alcohol messed with my medicine” incident. This is a “I’m going to beat you and blame it on alcohol and pretend i don’t remember it” incident 
"Yeah... nah.

You need to calm down and reread your posts and comments. Try to imagine that someone else wrote them. Attempt some self awareness. You'll see you're coming across as a hugely insecure, angry and somewhat manipulative person.

"Dude, CONTACT HER FRIENDS. This is unusual behaviour and warrants at least an alert situation for her safety. Like, it’s worth calling the cops if her friends haven’t heard from her."
"Oh god, it's horrifingly abusive.

Get out of there as soon as you can, and please get yourself into therapy so that you don't end up in a relationship with an abuser considering your ""normal"" meter is completely broken because of your father."

"You could try going on Facebook. Do you have Facebook Messenger? If your local law enforcement agency, or the child protective services of your state or province has a page on Facebook, try leaving a message on there asking for help and someone working for that agency may be able to respond, or talk to someone else on your behalf, then get back to you via message that way.

"You're 21, this guy's got too many issues to put up with. He's completely irresponsible and self absorbed to care about other people."
"Nope.

"You hit the nail on the head; it's assumed that we are thankful to be in their orbit. Nevermind the fact that they openly state they won't hire anyone into our positions with a PhD, so I'm at the highest level of education this position will accept. Can't win for losing. 

I could definitely see myself as a project manager, or grant manager. Something alongside academia but more of a managerial role. 

I agree with you re the commuting, as I type this from the train. I spent a little while last night looking at properties in my bf's city and it's amazing what I could get if I even just made a lateral move up there. 

Thank you for taking the time to write back to me. I really appreciate it. "
"No, you're not being ridiculous. For me, this would be my hill to die on. I'm rather mad on your behalf. I'd tell him, in your own wording, that you are open to negotiations. That you reject his current proposal and invite a counter proposal. Until such time, there will be no visits until a viable compromise between both parties can be arranged. Speaking together with a counsellor might speed up the negotiation process. I know all that sounds strangely formal but frankly, he's trying to move you out of the house you've lovingly upkept! To me, that screams bring on WWIII!"
Women like guys who don't make blanket generalisations about their gender.
"The guy tried his luck, you rejected him , he apologised and left in embarassement. Assaulting the guy for this would have been a very disproportionate retribution. Your reaction to this incident was perfectly fine IMHO and it is your fiancé who is out of line for getting so angry about it. Him saying you lead Dan on for having an adult conversation with him is fucked up and totally wrong. 

If a similar incident ever happens to my wife, I hope/think she will react like you did. "
"It's like saying, ""hey I hit you because I'm having problems at work"""
"Yeah I was going to point out first and most importantly that she needs to get her diabetes in check as soon as and if entirely possible. My wife has Type 1 and it's well managed so thankfully she hasn't been ""repeatedly at deaths door"" because of it. That shouldn't happen if properly managed. My wife is even able to drink fairly regularly without it being much more harmful."
no help here...you do deserve what you're going through 
"Omg, yes, leave the book on your desk. The thought of one of OP's bosses walking past her typing away with the book right there on the desk for everyone to see is so thrilling lmao"
"I think this is BS, what the behaviorist said.  Where i live, the dog would HAVE to legally be put down.  No matter what.  What happens if you go for a walk with him (or he is otherwise out in the neighbourhood) and he snaps and kills another pet?

Of course its not a dogs fault and not necessarily a behaviour problem, but its also not something owners could 100% control unless you keep him in the house at all times.  If he could kill a cat, he could also kill a baby.  Most of the cases I know of children and other small pets getting mauled were ""the first time"" its ever happened.  Well, now you've had your first time.  I am heartbroken for you, I'm heartbroken for everyone, but the dog needs to go.  "
"You’ve had your dog for five years, your bf had his cat for seven. If you’re using the amount of time you’ve had your pet as a relevant point to keep your pet, you should be able to empathise that your boyfriend is suffering a huge loss.

Your justifications are quite frankly alarming. It appears you’ve only posted here to get affirmation that you are in the right. 

Your boyfriend deserves better than someone who dismisses his trauma so easily. "
"Just to clarify, are you saying your dog never had any training because he never showed any signs of aggression, or was he trained and you just didn’t reply to that part? 

Because for anyone reading, PLEASE don’t neglect training your big ass dog because they don’t seem aggressive. All dogs are potentially dangerous and need training whether they’re aggressive or not. They’re dogs. They need guidance and boundaries, and you need to have worked on your communication together enough that they can understand you in a crisis."
"This. Exactly. If practicing law is an important goal to her, and it sounds like it is, this would be a horrible choice. And for her personal sanity too as it sounds like “being a mum” is not something she has a keen interest on spending more time on."
"&gt;I believed that if we just had sex, then maybe the intensity of my feelings would lessen (it usually does for me) but he says no. I think he's too scared.

Geez, it's no wonder why he doesn't speak to you anymore. You don't care about his reasons for not wanting to have sex, or the possibility that having sex with you might hurt him, you only care about what you can get out of him.

You can't relate to this guy at all, you can't understand why he's not ready to date yet, you can't even understand why he doesn't want to have sex with you. You won't take his ""no"" as a ""no"", why do you keep trying to push his boundaries? I wouldn't even call you his friend, just some chick that keeps badgering him for sex."
OP don’t that would just be really confrontational and the reply would be “reverse racism isn’t real” and hurt the relationship even more (I can speak from multiple first hand experiences at my school). A better idea would be to ask her to stop with the race labeling and stereotyping that she is doing in a stern but not argumentative way.
"OP, you keep making excuses- you can say the dog ""isn't aggressive"", ""just doesn't like other animals,"" etc, but the proof is in the pudding. Your dog DID growl. He DID get ""in the cats face"" and he DID proceed to get aggressive enough to KILL the cat. 

I don't think you are here wanting to know what you should do, I think you are here hoping to be reassured that you are in the right. You are willing to blame everyone but your dog or yourself for where you are at, and that is horrible for your boyfriend. No wonder he is out seeking support from someone else. You obviously blame him for this- I'm sure even if you haven't outwardly said it to him, he can see it all over your face and body language. If I were him, I could never forgive the dog, nor could I forgive your inability to put the blame where it belongs- on your aggressive dog, and on you for refusing to acknowledge that aggression at the expense of your boyfriends pet."
"You need a second, and third, opinion from a trainer who specializes in aggression. I can't believe how many people are justifying this behavior. It shouldn't matter what breed the dog is; if its first instinct is to kill, it needs serious training or rehoming."
"It isn't just about him feeling like he's failing.  If you're just initiating sex as a means to a baby, he may feel like you don't find him sexually attractive, and feel like just a baby making tool, which can negatively impact his self esteem, which will in turn put even more stress on the act itself.  Men want to feel sexually desired by their partners like anyone else."
"Sounds like your son has no faith in you. He's figured out whether consciously or subconsciously that you are an enabler, you will not be able to help him or protect him from Dad, and it is in his own best interest to just listen to whatever Dad says. 

You need to actually do something because your ""stepping in"" hasnt done shit."
"&gt; I might pay it off 3 months quicker

Have you done an amortized table to figure that out for sure? And figured out what your interest savings would be if you put more towards it?"
"This. My therapist said my dad emotionally abandoned me by not stepping in and stopping Mom’s abuse. 

Guess who’s now a barely functioning adult with a personality disorder that manifests in people who experienced emotional neglect..."
"Holy... 

Yeah, you did good with your decision. Stay way from such a toxic family connection, it would lead only to heartbreak."
"What you aren't understanding is that you are not down on your luck. You are poor. You and your boyfriend make low wages because you don't have the experience, knowledge or connections to make a higher wage. None of these things justify anyone giving you free rent. 

You keep suggesting that since you went to college and went into debt you're entitled to make more money than those who did not, but you're not. You keep suggesting that since you don't spend money on anything other than your living expenses that means you're making smart financial decisions and have done all you can do to stay afloat financially and now it's up to others to help you survive but it's that isn't true either. 

Unlucky would be losing all your possessions in a fire, a major health incident, etc. None of this has happened to you as far as I know. You're life at this point is just a reflection of your choices and you seem to be arguing that you have and are doing everything right when it's clear to anyone reading this that you have not.

You're 26, you're far from a child and the truth is that if you don't learn how to take responsibility for your life and you're survival soon, you're going to be a burden to those around you for a very long time."
"What everyone else said. But also dang Chica, keep that good head on your shoulders. So often now young people make the mistake of forgetting the internet is forever. Having these standards will save you a ton of pain!"

"Oh I can absolutely find this in my guidelines. It’s not in my “district handboook”, but in my state’s guidelines. I’m supposed to be evaluated on effectiveness in communicating with families and professional judgment.  I could totally give you “section 5.2” for it."

"My Uncle, Dad, and random bystander are dead because of a drunk driver in his early thirties. I'm sorry, but fuck your boyfriend and get with someone who has respect for you, themself, and others."
"&gt;with a fellow catlover

This qualifier is crucial.

To non-pet obsessed women, learning he ended a relationship with his successful doctor Ex right before moving into a house together over cats will make them back away quickly..

Ultimately, he needs to screen for women who are just as cat-loving as he is *and* will grow to love his cats. He could date a cat lover who has cats of her own, but doesn't bond with his cats and/or doesn't want to put up with constant cat puking. He's in a niche dating market and should put his cards on the table about his cats *early* (i.e., ""we are a packaged deal, and yes they have some health problems"")."
The only issue that I see is your husband will leave the room unlocked because that's his culture.  I haven't dealt with Indian families but I've had Indian coworkers and they always strive to be polite.  I would suggest politely asking for what you'd like.
"I suspect he's terrified that you will get sucked into religion, and his fear of this is driving his over-the-top behavior. If you haven't been Catholic it's very hard to understand how pervasive and stifling it can be, so you have no reference point for his anxiety. To him, it's very much like you've decided to take up snorting heroine recreationally, and he hears you telling him you won't get addicted. 

This is not to excuse his being a jerk to you, because he's handling this in exactly the opposite way he should. If I were you, I would sit him down and no uncertain terms tell him that he is driving you away with this constant and uncalled for criticism. That you aren't an idiot or a child, and you do not need or want him to passive-aggressively police your behavior. That this is not a slippery slope, and he's being as ridiculous in regards to your experience of these *buildings* and the atmosphere they contain as he would be if he was freaking out over your visiting an art museum. Tell him to stop it, right now - no more comments about religion, **none**. No snide remarks about God, no remarks about sheep, and his friends need to stop right now, as well. That if he persists you will take that to mean he no longer wants you as a partner, that's how serious this is. Because it is that serious: If he can't trust and respect you, there's no foundation for your relationship. "
"&gt; Later I'd sometimes see him send out an enthusiastic tweet about the show or movie I wanted him to watch, like he just discovered it and thought it was the greatest thing.

This is fucking weird.  And I'm particular as fuck when it comes to just about everything."
"At their house? Not much you can do except keeping to shorter stays. At your house? Completely separate issue. They have no business going into your bedroom when you aren’t home. That’s a personal space and I would be embarrassed if the same thing happened to me. Tell your husband he needs to have a conversation with his parents. It doesn’t have to be nastier than “Hey we don’t mind that you stop in on your way to the airport, but we insist that our bedroom remain private.” If completely necessary, lock your bedroom door while you’re away. You are not crazy for expecting this kind of basic privacy in your own home. "

"Handshake = Rejection.

Terrible suggestion."
"I said that it probably wasn't the first time you'd done stuff like that and then read further where you said you hadn't done anything like this before so retracted it. In any event was an assumption on my part and it was wrong to do that.

In future leave your phone on to ring if you have somewhere to be!!! :P

Why do her parents not like you? Have you had much interaction with them?"
"Yes you will, and you'll be back here a few months after you marry him asking to help you figure out if he's cheating on you (he's probably already doing it, going by your last comments). He's 40 years old, you still chose to get engaged to him knowing his history, he's not changing. The best case here is that he tells you he's gonna cut her out and then doesn't and sleeps with her on the DL. He will not change."
"'All guys are immature'


Least mature thing I've read here today."
"You should Google ""emotional labor"" - basically, from your comments, it sounds like you're fed up with doing ALL of the emotional labor, and you wanted him to make one gesture, and plan this one, single date without you hand holding for the entire planning process, and he dropped the ball. 

There's a comic strip that I think you should look at called ""You Should Have Asked"" that sums things up really well, and could be helpful. "

I've been homeless before. A night of feeling normal can go a long way. If a bunch of your relatives are staying in a hotel see if there are any older cousins who may want to share 2 bed room with him. If you've been sleeping in a car for months even a night on an army cot can do wonders.
Not necessarily. Many US states are true no fault states... Proof of infidelity is completely irrelevant there.

"You have to be careful here, legally speaking.   Because you were named as a trustee in the will and you have accepted that role up until now, you can't just disburse all the money at once because it's easier on you.  You have a fiduciary duty to ensure the funds are held and disbursed according to the terms of the trust.

If you just hand out everything now and it gets squandered by Tonya, Ruby can sue you when she turns 18 and you can be personally liable to repay that money.

Monthly instalments would be much better, as long as the amount is reasonable.  It should NOT be the full cost of supporting her, and there should be a written legal agreement with Tonya as to specifically what the funds can be used for -- this transfers some of the legal liability to her.  If Ruby needs anything not covered under that agreement, then special requests can be made for disbursement, as is done now.

In order to make your own life sane, you MAY want to consider setting up an annuity structure:  the trust pays out $X/month, to either Ruby's legal guardian or to Ruby herself when she turns 18.  Calculate what $X should be if you want the fund to last until she's a specific age (25?  30?  40?).  Reserve a certain amount of the fund to be used for special expenses (e.g. legal expenses re: custody, medical expenses, etc);  if these funds aren't used by the time the trust expires, it's paid out as a lump sump (plus whatever interest has been accrued).  This way there's no squabbling about how much is fair in terms of the costs to keep her fed / clothed / etc -- the trust has a structure, and that's that... that's all the money there is, except for specific unexpected expenses."

"We absolutely will. It's unfortunate, we looked at a place literally half as expensive as this place. What was one of the deciding factors? The place we decided on looked like it had much thicker walls. We're really not loud, but we didn't want to be tip toeing around. Clearly, that's not what ended up happening. It's unfortunate because when we realized the place had terrible sound insulation I tried to go out of my way to impress upon her that we didn't want to bug her. It's not the message as much as it is the tone. It went from 6 people listening to music to 2 people over watching TV. Should we refrain from having friends over until we can move out in 2019? What if it gets to the point where any TV is too much? Her boundaries are not equitable. We get irritated when her dog barks all day because it's irritating. I'm not going to ask her to get him better training or get rid of her dog; I understand that that's just the way sound carries in this building. In the same way, I'm not going to refrain from having guests or watching TV because she can't handle an iota of noise. She needs to understand that this is a two way street, and if she's going to make it very difficult to live in our own home then I'm going to be far less inclined to meet her every wish. She's backing us into a corner where we either have to be totally silent or start pushing back, and I'm sad that it's gotten to that point. "

"Honestly, I don't know what to tell you man. I couldn't be with you after that. I would seriously divorce you, I'm not saying she would but I would think of that EVERY TIME we had sex. Is he really thinking about me and enjoying me, or is his mind with his ex? is he even here WITH ME making love to me right now?  So, yeah, maybe don't tell her. But you should also consider why you're doing this and also maybe if you wouldn't like it if the roles were reversed stop? like, try and be in the moment with your wife? maybe ask her to experiment with you? God I just thought if I were in her position and it would really suck."

"I lied my ass off the first time I saw a new psychologist because I was scared. She is probably totally used to it. I wouldn't give up just for that. In fact, she may not even bring it up right away- she may try to let you build trust with her and become comfortable to the point where you bring it up yourself. 

I would at least try a second appointment. You can still leave after that if you decide it isn't working out. 

As for your boyfriend- as someone who has sabotaged themselves in appointments before I know how frustrating it can be to the people around me. But on the other hand, finding a psychologist is not an easy process and there is definitely the chance you won't mesh with this one for other reasons and will have to find a new one. It is unreasonable to expect that you never change psychologists, regardless of what deposit you have to pay. "
"I imagine it's mostly women empathizing with his gf who was ditched and receiving the cold shoulder.  While what he did was shitty, his GF has a friend talking shit about him (which said friend started btw) and she agrees with it rather than stick up for her bf.

"I find it concerning that you would say that Zack is a good father just because he's never hit his child and ""provides for him."" I assume you mean that he provides the bare necessities here. That alone does not make a good parent. Now add the fact that he is an alcoholic and does not maintain his environment in a way suitable for a child, you have major issues that a court should know about in order to determine 'fitness' of a parent. 

In my opinion, this is Zack's mistake. He asked someone that he does not have a good relationship with (irony here is the relationship is bad because of the alcohol) to testify in court about his fitness as a parent. You can't possibly want your son to lie under oath as a witness in a legal proceeding. And honestly, I don't think you should attempt stop him from testifying. "

"My boyfriend and I chose not to go to our proms. We both found it a waste of time and money.

"I absolutely do this, next to my husband, lol. We have a great sex life and are both adventurous, but sometimes you've had pizza for dinner or something and don't feel sexy. I tend to masturbate as a sleep aid. The husband doesn't mind. He doesn't like to masturbate much himself, though I encourage it when I'm not up for sex. No need for us to hide it at all.

I remember waking up once while we were dating and discovering he'd been masturbating, after choosing not to come to sleep with me knowing it would lead to sex. My feelings were hurt... but in hindsight I know it didn't mean any particular thing. That was early on when confidence was still shaky within the relationship on my end. I don't blame OP's gf for feeling rejected, but it's healthier to come at it from a different perspective."

"We have found family. I'm estimating (wildly) that over 100 people will be attending his memorial service (with some friends estimating 200-300) which shows how loving, giving, and wonderful my husband is. He is not without love.

That said, IDK where this is coming from with his family of origin. My guess is that he's gay - they're Baptists - but his friends have mixed messages on how accepting they are. (My husband, when he came out, was prepared to be kicked out and even had a place to stay and bags packed. It did not come to that, but the best he had to say was that it did not come to that. His dad, who is elderly and not running this show, was fairly accepting and mostly wanted to make sure his boyfriends treated him well. Everyone else... didn't get a story.)"
If your husband is preying on women then uh yeah you drop your husband. That's fucked up.
"Why are you assuming he's telling the truth about what his mom said? I'm baffled by this. You show him lying, twice, and then he disappears, ""talks to his mom"", and she just happens to make an irresponsible parenting decision out of your earshot and you believe him immediately after his lies? You should call her not to confront her, because I saw you're afraid of that, but because you *might* lose *her* friendship if she learns that he told you ""mom said it's okay!"" and you didn't see through what sounds like an obvious lie."
"This.This.THIS!

Have you though of this yet OP? Fuck this dude. "
At this point take out the “please”. Just a straight up “do not comment on my appearance/food/etc”
"I dont think incest porn is mainstream enough for this to be a ""haha, guess my teenage son is finally getting boners"" situation. Finding out your kid watches videos of dudes having sex with their ""moms"" goes way beyond knowing your kid will be interested in sex one day. Everyone knows their kid will be interested in/have sex eventually, but no one's prepared for their kid to want to have sex with them. Familial relationships are pretty much accepted as being the least sexy thing in the world."
"After that physical abuse you learned to just accept the emotional abuse and controlling behavior. That's horrible. I'm sorry that happened to you. 


Just because someone is angry they don't get a free pass to act out on that anger. Our emotions do not = our actions. 


I think this relationship is extremely unhealthy and you should leave. She. Physically. Abused. You. You don't deserve that. "
It sounds like SHE is in HIS country and she is unable to get a lease somewhere because she is the foreigner 
"Why on earth are you engaged to someone this deplorable?  He sounds like an awful person, and since he's keeping her around and had cheated with her before, you should expect he will cheat on you with her too.  Come on OP...it's really obvious this guy is not marriage material."

"I also think people are being unnecessarily harsh, but I’ve learned from other gift threads that this subreddit skews very “you should be grateful for whatever you get” &amp; that you’re selfish if you don’t like a gift that someone close to you picked that’s not to your tastes. 

Also, I’m thinking English may not be OP’s first language, so all the words she’s being criticized for using may be her best translations. "
Police officer here. So many LEO marriages break down because the civilian partner cannot live with the ways their partner has changed. It's nobody's fault.  It's just hard not to have a morbid sense of humor when you are constantly dealing with the worst humanity has to offer.

So you're mad he was never around but you're also mad because he forced you to visit him so he could be around? Do you see how backwards your logic is?

"If the alarm goes off, it goes off. You need to get your little sister to a hospital immediately. She could die from being slapped - and time matters in this.

"Yep. If the very worst thing she can say about this girl is that she does nice things for people to get them to like her, then she's grasping at straws.  

OP sounds very bitter indeed and is lashing out at Callie because she was (rightfully, in my opinion) excluded from the dinner."
"Well, if my roommate told me that an abusive guy with a gun might show up at my apartment I would be afraid too. "
"I agree with the one person who told you to try and contact her parents. Also ask your parents what they think would be best, as they might be able to drive you to get the things?"
"Yeah, my grandparents had a bitter miserable marriage too."
"Honestly, if you message her parents and explain what happened, they might be nice enough to send it back to you. If you're feeling generous, offer to pay the shipping fees. If her parents are decent people they would be appalled to find out that you told you that since your family has more money, she gets to keep your stuff. "
Are you sure her particular church doesn’t have anything like those camps?
"Apart from the deceit and all the other stuff people have raised, here are some practical considerations:

1) Do you want kids? If so, do you see yourself having kids with him? Is he the kind of role model you want for your kids? If he's so lazy will he be prepared to do his fair share of raising the kids (which since he doesn't work should be as the primary parent/stay at hime dad)? Who is going to pay for the costs of raising your kids and sending them to college? Are his parents going to contribute his part of that too?

2) how wealthy are his parents? How long are they going to pay all of his expenses? How long before you end up taking over paying for him? What happens when his parents die, are they going to leave him enough money to sustain him for the rest of his life - including unforseen medical emergencies and money for possible assisted care and other costs when he is elderly? Or are your savings going to have to stretch to cover both of you long term?

3) Right now you guys rent and his parents pay his half. Do you want to buy a house eventually? Are his parents going to pay for half of that too? Do you want to travel, buy nice things, achieve other financial goals? Are his parents going to chip in half for all that or will you be on the hook for all of it? 

4) If he has lied to you this for this long and in such a sustained manner, what else is he capable of lying to you about? Do you feel you trust him? Do you feel you respect him? Do you feel you know who he really is?

Ask yourself these things and see where you get to."
"&gt; He understood how I felt, though I'm not sure he understood why. Regardless, he didn't fight me on it, and I've never heard of any photos since.

"&gt;do i go hi i want to go on a date, and leave it there?

Nope! Because in that hypothetical scenario, you didn't actually ask her out on a date. You announced that you want an unspecified date, and then completely left it on your imaginary ladyfriend to take up the reins of actually planning it.

Here's what you say instead: ""I really enjoy talking to you and would love to get to know you better. Would you like to go get [COFFEE/DRINKS/DINNER] with me on [SPECIFIC DAY] at [SPECIFIC TIME]?""

How did you just happen to end up going to lunch one-on-one with girls? Someone asked, right? Suggested it, named a place, etc? You need to do that with dates, too.

It takes courage, and it can be really scary. But it seems like you have a repeated pattern of just hoping that a relationship will magically emerge, and it just won't. You have to be proactive, and that means putting yourself out there and accepting that you will indeed face rejection along the way. You'll survive, I promise."
"He wants her to be the ""cool minority""...the one everyone uses when they say ""I have a ____ friend"", who looks the other way or laughs along at racist jokes and doesn't associate much with their own group's culture. The one where they can say ""oh, I forgot you're a _____ because you act so white/so straight/like one of the guys/etc!""

But joke's on him, because she's ten times cooler than his racist ass."
"I am having the same issue with my relationship as OP, word for word, almost. Can I ask - how did this work for you? did you make plans to call, did you ask him ""can I call you?"" or did you just pick up the phone and call each other more, just like that?
"
"&gt;I've tried to talk about this with them many times but he gets very defensive and annoyed that I'm talking about it. 

This in itself should be a deal breaker. You dont marry someone who you cant talk to about serious stuff"
"It can be pretty expensive too for what you get... I was looking up insurance for my two cats and the cheapest option was like $50 a month with a $250 (or maybe $500 with two cats) deductible. I'm just looking at a yearly checkup right now, but some of them don't even cover preventative care. When it comes to emergencies, I'd be better off just putting the same amount of money in a savings account. "

"&gt;  I have no idea why he'd lie to me about this - when he's telling me he wants to set those boundaries. 

But you do have an idea:

&gt; It seems like he's telling us both what we want to hear. 

Your husband grew up with his mother's manipulations. It is probably unthinkable to him to resist them. 

&gt; How can my husband set realistic boundaries with a woman who has no concept of boundaries?

This is a good question, but it assumes that your husband *wants* to set boundaries with her and is willing to do so. If he does Mommy will be upset, and he's spent the last 31 years in fear of Mommy being upset. The idea that the world will not end if Mommy is upset is not something he understands. "
"She should leave him but your comment is wrong. People at any age can change, and from what ive seen, late 20s/early 30s are when alot of people truly start to mature. The parties are over, hangovers hurt more, age is setting in physically more... The desire to be wild is less than early to mid 20s. There's no age limit on people changing things like that."
"Holy shit dude, she lost her sister a WEEK ago! I could see if you were making this post like 6 months from now, but god damn, show some compassion.

You know what else is physically and mentally exhausting (among many, many other things?) UNEXPECTEDLY LOSING YOUR SISTER A WEEK AGO! "
"Wait, your fiance died THREE WEEKS AGO, and people noticed you are ""struggling""? You make it sound like struggling is an odd reaction. And then you cried when your sister announced her pregnancy, and now she is mad because you told about being pregnant with your late fiance's baby THREE WEEKS after he died? It's been three weeks. NOTHING is normal yet. You are probably so in the depths of grief that I can't even comprehend it. Give yourself a break. Stay away from your sister for awhile. Lean on real friends and family. Maybe see a grief counselor. Good luck, OP. I am sorry for your loss. "

"From an outsider's point of view you are coming across as a victim of your husband but you're an adult and have a **shit ton** of resources your children don't have. Wield them!

Here are some examples: 

You are allowed to walk away when you're being abused. Your kids can't. 

You are allowed to call the police and they will show up and they will listen to you. If your kids dared call the police their story will be dismissed in favor of your husband's version of events.

You can call a lawyer and get help strategizing your escapes. Your kids have ONLY you to depend on. 

You can file for divorce and even get financial support for your new life with them. Obviously your kids cannot.  They cannot get a new home. They cannot get transportation. They cannot go where they are safe, physically and emotionally. They are *literally* unable to keep themselves safe so you will have to do it for them. 

Here are the first two steps that occur to me, but other folks might have better ones:

1) therapist for yourself (you need a support network to do this without losing your mind. Do you have any family who are trust worthy?)

2) lawyer for you and your kids.

If your husband comes to his senses then great but act as though that's not a possibility."
"&gt; record the screaming

No fucking shit. 

This hits home for me.  mid 30's now and I was chatting with my long time friend i knew in HS.  Was saying how my enabling mom is now downplaying the toxic childhood we had.  My friend literally laughed and was like:  ""I could hear your dad screaming the nasty things he would say to you every time we were on the phone together.""

OP is putting up hurdles and excuses cuz she doesn't actually want to leave.  She wants validation for her enabling.

"
The son is clearly terrified of his father. $1000 says the kid says he wants to live with Dad full time out of fear.
"This. I would've had to add in a passive aggressive sentence like ""If you ever feel that the money you accepted from me to pay medical bills that were already covered was immorally or fraudulently gained those funds can be returned to my bank account if it would help to ease your guilt."""
"Well, talk to her first.

Among other things, you should point out that once you have this conversation with *him,* there's not gonna be any ""preserving the friendship"" that she can do. If she chooses to break up with you for her own reasons, that's all well and good, but if she does it to try to make things better between you and him, then she's only going to be hurting the two of you more."

But you don't have a job, and you're now going to get rid of a stable house and a car??

"Based on comments that he’s made to her (regarding OP’s inclusion in their wedding), I wouldn’t be surprised if she already knows."
"It sounds like you're making every effort to keep it open and platonic, which is great. You might just be an empathetic person, and your friend's troubles are weighing on you the same way a male friend's troubles might. But I read your update about the flirting, and that to me is a red flag. Again, think about how your wife would feel if she witnessed this. A good friend wouldn't do anything that might hurt your marriage, so please be honest with yourself and look at your friend's behavior as objectively as possible. If she isn't behaving like your marriage is worth respecting and protecting, she isn't a good friend."
"It’s not an ultimatum if you mean it though. Boyfriend needs to get off the silent treatment train, and understand that treating OP like that is break up territory "
"Eh. It doesn't sound like he'll mind the divorce with his hot ""little sister"" there."

if living your life like a proper adult its hurting them then so be it. Its not your fault they have unrealistic expectations and you are not forced whatsoever to enable this behaviour."

THIS."
"&gt; Some people have an innate need for approval.     

&gt; Negging works based on this need. Many people [...] have a tendency to try to maintain a positive image, and the sense of ""achievement"" when they feel they achieved that image is usually very satisfiying.

This is true in many cases. To add onto that, though, another reason negging can work is because it's disarming. Women who get approached by men in public aren't expecting to be insulted or to have the guy say something impudent—especially in places where hook-ups are notorious, like bars. 

And when it does happen, the implication is that the guy has other options, that he's not super impressed by or attempting to impress her, or even that he's not *trying* to hit on her or pick her up. It makes the encounter slightly shocking to begin with, and the woman ""realizes"" that the guy isn't supplicating to her or being overly complimentary or a try-hard... and that can be refreshing in a sea of guys who DO behave that way. 

It might not even be her subconsciously trying to win his approval. It could just be her feeling more comfortable around a guy who *isn't* obviously trying to get in her pants. So she feels disarmed, relaxed, and is able to interact with the guy in a more personal, authentic manner. 

For him, it's a game—or at least a manipulation with an agenda. For her, it's a guy who *seemingly* treats her more like an equal by not fawning over her. It works because that's just how humans are. If someone has an obvious agenda, you're going to be suspicious and wary. If someone seems bold and audacious yet teasing and true-to-himself (while secretly having the exact same agenda as the other guy), you might be unguarded and easily taken in.

EDIT: This whole situation seems so weird, though. The OP never even *remembered* her fiancé during that electrifying conversation with another man? The guy never asked if she was single, or mentioned anything related to relationships, even though he was clearly interested in her? She didn't feel any pangs of guilt or awareness about having such an intimate conversation with another guy, whom she felt extremely attracted to? 

And where were her friends while all this was happening? She shut them out, turned her chair around, talked with this guy all evening in an intimate tête-à-tête, and they were just... okay with it? Those friends are either oblivious, complete pushovers, or didn't care that their friend was toeing the line of impropriety and obviously forgetting herself / her relationship. OP, you might want to ask your friends what they were thinking."
"Honestly, you could even go with first names. ""Your daddy's mom? Her name is Jane Smith. Jane lives far, far away."" And then just call her ""Jane"" after that. If you ever have to talk about her husband, you can just call him ""Jane's husband, John."" 

If your kids ask ""Is Jane my grandma?"" you can say ""well, a Grandma isn't always about being your daddy and mommy's dad and mom. You know how you call your Aunt Susie, Aunt Susie, even though she isn't Mommy's sister? Aunt Susie has been Mommy's best friend since before you were born, and she loves you like family. That's why we call her Aunt Susie. Well, a Grandma is someone who shows how much she loves you and how much she cares, like when Grandma Mary [reads stories, makes cakes, whatever she does that's special grandma/kid stuff]. That's why she's your Grandma Mary. Your dad's mom Jane doesn't do any of those things, does she? So she's your dad's mom... but she's not really your Grandma Jane."""
"&gt;Don't ask your mom for shit anymore. She a taker.

So OP's mom is a 'taker' because she stopped giving OP a free ride after she displayed unappreciative behavior?

OP's mom buys her food, cooks for her, washes her dishes, buys food for her cat, drives her to and from work and who knows where else and doesn't charge her for rent or utilities. And that's just what we know from OP's post and comments.

OP then kept condescendingly picking at her mom about using the PS4 and ordered her mom to buy an HDMI cable because she wants her mom to stop being ""technologically dependent"" on her--when OP is extremely dependent on her mom, financially and otherwise. And when using the PS4 for Netflix in the long run is not a big enough issue that OP needed to pick at.

Mom has apparently decided that if OP is going to lecture her over using her PS4 under the guise of her mom being ""dependent on OP,"" then maybe OP should the same treatment--here's a small taste of what it's like when you're no longer dependent on mom. And even then $100 a month is absolutely nothing compared to what OP would be paying if her mom actually cut her off.

"I'll give your husband a pass since he was drunk, but in any other situation, he should shut that behavior down when it happens. You're his partner, about to be his wife, and people shouldn't talk bad about you in front of him. It's disrespectful to you, but it's also disrespectful to the relationship, so he should stand up for you.

I'd let him know that you overheard it, and that you're hurt, and don't want him to think that about you. I don't think he would, and he was denying it, but it at least lets him know the cat's out of the bag.

This may be their way of ""looking out for him"", if that's what they really think, but that doesn't mean it should keep happening. Ideally, your husband should tell them, ""About what you said the other night. I was too drunk to tell you to knock it off, but seriously. Knock it off. I love her, and she loves me, and we're happy. That's all that matters. I won't stand for you speaking about her that way anymore.""

"The thing is, you both know he's abusive. You commisserated over it before. She had a good opinion of you, and you were very much an adult when this happened, not some kind of loudmouth kid who can't handle secrets.

How hard would it have been to

1. agree to father's outrageous bullshit
2. send you a text or e-mail behind his back, letting you know what REALLY happened but telling you to keep it quiet so she continues to receive health coverage? (I know this is dishonest but I legitimately don't care about the feelings of a man who would financially extort his daughter who is *suffering from cancer* to create a rift between her and her sister.)

If she was worried about him finding the messages, delete the texts, use a burner phone, use a throwaway email at a library, keep your phone under 2 locks and hide notifications on the lock screen and never have it on your person in his vicinity, *whatever you fucking have to do.* Because this is honestly ridiculous.

I know that abuse can really mess with someone's head, but I don't know how she justified this to herself for over a year."
"Beat me to it. Being raised by narcissists means I can put a literal price tag on how much my sanity and well-being is worth to me. Currently, it’s over 6 figures."

"Stay out of it and separate yourself, and your wife from this bullshit. They call you about it? Tell them you are not involved and refuse to talk to them about it. They're both adults.

"She lost her right to a key when she invaded your privacy and had the nerve to tell you you were doing something wrong in your own home. If your husband doesn't understand that, you need to sit him down and have a looooooong talk about boundaries."
[deleted]
In a lot of places if you're married he is assumed to be the father and has rights. Or he can get a lawyer and get a paternity test which proves he's the father with rights. I'm assuming since she's 7 months pregnant that an abortion isn't an option. So unless something tragic happens the baby will be born and if he wants to be involved and he's not abusive or something it shouldn't be hard for him to prove the child is his. 
"&gt; and she just kind of expects it.

There's the problem. She expects everything of you, but nothing of herself. You're the man. You take care of everything she wants and needs and she just gets to exist and put out every once in a while."
"Yeah I don't think they're compatible.

This is something that affects her life and her family, its hard to tell her to ""tone down"" something that is actively hurting her well-being. Especially since she was not born here, AND the fact that Trump is actively trying to stop immigration and deport foreign nationals that (used to be) legally here. We have no idea how far he'll go, her fear is justified.

I have a bunch of friends who are legal green card holders who are afraid to leave this country for fear that they will not be let back in.

I can see how this is depressing. Hell, I used to be SUPER into politics but I check the news much less now because it depresses me. But there's no way telling someone to stop talking about something that actively affects them will go over well."
"If anything, you're underreacting. Look at the guys in /r/creepyPMs. You husband is one of them.


Do you want your daughter to grow up with the mindset that it's okay when daddy drunkenly harrasses other women?"

"I think it’s cheating, and you should break up with him. "
I didn’t read it all but you are an adult in your 30’s and can’t watch the TV shows you like because of nudity ? What does she think is going to happen? She is extremely insecure. It’s unhealthy. I would say either she gets therapy or you break up. You’re a grown man having your entire life censored and basically parentally controlled 
Gross gross gross. You know what ruins the mood? You worrying about how you're going to be uncomfortable and in pain later. That would be a real mood killer. Asking him to go wash his hands before fingering you is perfectly reasonable. Honestly if I were you I wouldn't even want to be sexy with him anymore. UTIs are miserable. 
"Our house is where everyone usually hangs out so I know they will be looking for a place to hang out come Friday.

So they hang out all the time at your place and then ignore and not invite you. Moochers, I would call them out on it."
"It's not your house, it's your mom's house and grandma's house so long as she refuses to stand up to her. I think once you accept that this was the place you grew up in, and only that nothing more, you'll feel less anger.

As for the rest you are doing a fantastic job taking care of your own life with strong boundaries. Continue to ignore gma's bs as when it directly affects you. Not much else you can do other than that.

I know it sucks to watch your mom and family give into her bullshit, but their choices aren't really your business or up to you to change. "

"A the research shows that authoritarian parenting results in anxious, depressed young adults who.lack confidence. Your wife is crippling your son just as surely as if he was a toddler and she kept him strapped in a stroller all day to keep him from walking or running. 

Someday, he may write in here, where he will be urged to make and to move out as soon as possible, achieve complete independence, and cut out his narcissistic, overcontrolling mother and enabling father as soon as possible. 

You should stand up for your son's right to grow up by whatever means necessary. 

As a first step, show her research on helicopter parenting. 

Step Two, take her to a child psychologist for a discussion about parenting in a developmentally appropriate manner. 

Step Three, couples counseling. 

Step Four, Separation and divorce if necessary. 

Your son has no one to stand up for him except for you. If he is unleashed onto the world stunted the way your wife wishes, he will not be ok. His growth and mental health is at stake.  You need to make this the hill you die on.  "
Exactly. She's going to end up hitting and probably killing a person. And then what...she loses her license and possibly goes to jail. She needs to go back to driving classes. And tbh I wouldn't talk to her if she hit and killed someone I cared about either.

"Talk to your therapist, sure. You should feel comfortable in your skin, and in your relationship, so other pretty people don't shake you up so much. 

That said... you don't necessarily have to be comfortable with your partner loading up a movie and skipping through to only watch sex scenes. If he wanted to watch porn and get sexy, he could be upfront about that, and if that isn't your cup of tea, that's okay. Still, talk it through with your therapist, and then talk it through with your boyfriend.  "
"Here's my opinion on the ""red flags"" you've written about.

&gt; Her cell phone is her biggest treasure and it never leaves her side. She typically sets it face down with the ringer off. 

Not suspicious. If she posts a lot on social media, seeing an instagram notification flash up on your phone every few minutes can be really distracting. Also I never have the ringer on for my phone.

&gt; She said that they were meeting up at a bar but didn't have any plans after that

&gt; This girl then proceeded to tell me exactly what bars and clubs they were planning on going to (remember my wife said she had no clue of where they were going)

Not suspicious. Some peolpe retain this info, others don't. Some people are planners, some people are happy to just follow others on a night out. I have friends who will ask me where we're going on  the weekend, I'll tell them, then the next day they will have completely forgot. To them, we're just ""going out"", it doesn't matter where.

&gt; I asked her why she kept it a secret before when I asked about her plans. She said that it was not planned and that's just where they decided to go.

Seriously, maybe your wife just wasn't in the planning conversation. She sounds stressed and unhappy with your relationship currently, she may have just been in a ""I don't care where we go, I just want to go out"" mood, while the others planned.

&gt; When I asked why she got home so late she said that she was on the drive way talking to her friend in the car and didn't come in because she didn't want to wake the kids.

I've had nights where the time completely gets away form me. If this is a rare night out it's not surprising she wanted to make the most of it?

&gt;  I asked if she just took those pics and she said, she took them a while back.

I've done that. Not suspicious.

&gt;  Yesterday I was looking for something and found a several pieces of lingerie (including crotchless panties)

I mean, this is the only one that's weird to me. I can't imagine buying crotchless underwear and wearing them not for sex Maybe she just washed them before trying them on, then didn't like them? 

I don't think it adds up to cheating. But I think your wife is definitely unhappy."

"I tried this, her response was asking me whether I thought she wasn’t doing a good job at home. Maybe it’s worth another try when things aren’t so volatile like they were then. "
It's hasn't even been 3 months yet...chill out. 
"I dunno, it doesn't make a lot of sense for her to just give up because there's money to not do anything. People don't just have ambition because it pays the bills, y'know?

It sounds to me that she's going through a hard time and is using the idea of being a homemaker as an escape. I'd be very surprised if it's really about her being at home at all, but more her feeling insecure about her future (maybe she doesn't think she's good enough for grad school?), so she's putting her head down. I remember when I was in my early 20's and finishing up my undergrad, and was very anxious for a while. I had no idea what I wanted to do, and the idea of doing the wrong thing was very paralysing.

So I don't know, I'd just go easy. I doubt this is just about money or her general lack of ambition. I feel like she's going through a bit of a crisis here. I think she'll have to work through it, whatever it is. In the interim some compassion and some space from you for her to figure it out might be a good start?"
This should be higher. Well done. 100% true. 
"Dude, so easy, just use your words and don't let her twist it into an option. IT IS NOT AN OPTION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BABY.

""I want to wear condoms because we need to be protected against pregnancy as I do not want to be a father for a few years at least still. This is for safety. I'll miss being condom free as I'm sure you will to but this way I can enjoy having sex without the lingering fear of accidental pregnancy""


If she wants to have a baby, then you need to breakup so she can meet someone who also wants to have a baby.

Id you're not ready, you're not ready. Don't set yourself on fire just to keep her warm.  "
"I was really good friends with his wife as well. A few times she was in my area without him and stayed with me/us.

"Perhaps this is my internal biases speaking, but I really feel like people are crap (pun unintended) at a.) Considering what embarrassing someone achieves and b.) Stopping themselves once they've got the embarrassment train rolling and also c.) Maturely dealing with the logical consequences of publically humiliating someone.

Life Pro Tip: People don't like being publically ridiculed, so don't do it. People are more likely to like you when you make them feel good about themselves."
"You have my sympathies. This sounds like an extraordinarily difficult situation.

I would start by offloading some of the logistical responsibilities. Show your mother how to use uber/lyft and stop driving her places. Sign up for one of the dozens of caregiver apps and have them stop by a few times a week to help out. This will help free up some time for you.

As far as freeing up emotional space, it's time to start drawing some boundaries. I would start off by explaining to your mom that your plate is very full right now and you can't be her only emotional support. That if she needs somebody to talk to she should speak to her doctors about a mental health consult and find a good therapist that she can vent to. 

Then when she calls you to vent you have your rote responses:

""That sounds like an excellent thing to bring up with your therapist.""

You can't keep going like this or else you're going to freak and go no contact or have a complete mental breakdown. So start distancing yourself, offloading as much as you can, and putting some boundaries in place."

Is the 7 month relationship you have developed with this woman worth fighting about this issue for the rest of your life?
"Time for consequences, just like you do with a child “ you bring up this subject we don’t communicate or interact for x amount of time and we leave the situation immediately”. Each transgression the consequence will be more severe. Fully expect having to actually follow up, years of I consequences means she doesn’t take you seriously. This all has to come from your wife. Also expect an extinction burst."
"This is the best advice. I’m sorry, OP. I grew up in a home with an abusive dad. I get it. Stay strong and be persistent about getting help. If you aren’t comfortable with the police (I remember I never was either as a kid because they didn’t do anything)—talking to your school counselor and being persistent about not going back to the house is the best thing you can do. I’m so sorry for you and your sister. You are a really awesome sibling."
"My dad and I were at a brand new Korean restaurant in L.A. once (my dad is from Korea), and the people next to us, clearly on a date, ordered raw skate (hongeo). The New York Times described this dish as smelling like a combination of outhouse and ammonia. 

My dad whispered to me, ""Even I don't eat that!"" Those poor people were so horrified but it was clearly an early date. They were trying so hard to be polite anyway. But that dish is the worst. We wanted to tell them to just order the Korean BBQ.... "
We like our boiled veg in northern England. :)
"I'm a marine hobbyist and absolutely 100% do not recommend 'cycled' water for new set ups. The vast majority of the tank's ability to process ammonia and nitrates is in the substrate and rocks - some say over 90%. Dumping live stock into something like instant ocean is a brilliant way to crash your tank. Cycled water alone is not enough, ever. 

Those TV shows often do daily 50+% water changes and often take place over weeks, not days, despite what it looks like. And they're professionals. 

Instant ocean is a worst case scenario option, but there are dozens more options I would choose before using something like that in a tank. "
"You knew ""very very few"" people whose birthdays were in the six months between January and June? **Half the year**? That doesn't make any sense. Even if your grade was a crazy statistical anomaly, why would you assume that's the norm for every other school, to the point of making a comment about it that it can't be right that someone would turn 18?


I don't know what to tell you man, maybe you've been out of school for awhile and you just don't remember, but it's not possible that everyone in your state was 17 when they graduated. It's not even possible for just your school, given that you already confirmed that you abided by a typical school calendar. Unless you were in some special K-12 program where everyone entered a year early, it just doesn't add up.

Edit: removed the part where I didn't understand NY enrollment dates"

My manager told me about it because he just wanted me to know it was happening, but he backs me up all the way and doesn't think I did anything to warrant this guy's behavior. If I told him I wanted this guy out of here, he'd back me up I believe, but I just don't know if I'm justified to want him gone/I'm worried other regulars who know C would hold it against me if he got kicked out...or if I should even worry about that."
"For the record, sometimes people in families try to bury their head in the sand and give people the benefit of the doubt to avoid upsetting things.

Downvote me, haters. I was 17 and he was my 35-year-old stalker. Alas, you can't charge someone for following you down streets, malls, to/from work, and on public transport, apparently, so indecent assault was the best I could get, and I'll stand by it until the day I die."

"Oh the joys of pregnancy on top of everything else she's doing right now. I was a resentful pain in the ass to my husband during our 2nd pregnancy, still very happily married, but he will tell you as much as I will that pregancy #2 was no fun. We didn't want another baby, we didn't plan another baby, our first was barely 1, and the fact that my husband was happy about it just added to my misery. He was happy, amd he's an excellent father, but he didn't have to carry the baby, have the baby, breast feed it, stay home with it, figure out how to have a career with another baby, etc, etc, etc.  And there was something about the 2nd pregnancy that was different, I just felt different, I chalk it up to being pregnant with a boy, but who knows, just the way my body reacted. I was normally a level headed, calm, fun, patient person, and that boy made me aggressive and mean, it was like 10 mos of pms (which I never even had much of) on steroids, I felt like a teenage boy who just wanted to hit things. The first one was all glowing and incredible, 2nd not so much. I knew the way I felt and was acting didn't make any sense, was out of character for me, but it was still there. Hormones all out of whack and if I wasn't pregnant my dr. probably would have diagnosed me with something, or multiple things lol, but pregnant there's nothing you can do about it. I'm not saying it's an excuse, it just kind of is what it is and you just get through it to the other side. Plus, between being pregnant with the first, having a very young toddler, being pregnant again, studying, I would bet just about anything the woman needs sleep- not like 1 good night, like a month's worth.  I'm def not saying that just because you're pregnant it's a free pass for whatever, just understand that she's put a lot of hard work getting to where she's at, especially with a 1 yr old around., and it's something that you don't have to deal with. She probably gets that it's not fair or even reasonable to point the finger at you, but it is easy to go that direction. As good as you are as a husband and father, there is absolutely nothing you can do to help out with what's happening inside her body. You can  take things with a grain of salt, help out even more with the little one, give her time to wrap her brain around things a little. As angry as I was we would both do it all over again, I wouldn't trade my little man for anything. 3 days after he came I was back to my old self, and she probably will be too. Good luck and congratulations!"
"She sounds unstable.

Either that or she's still with the new boyfriend and he decided to take up her tinder profile to dig dirt on her"
I'm so sorry she did that to you. She's not a good friend. 
"Breathe, my friend. 

Girls are just humans. What do you like to do with other humans you know? Would you like to see if she would like to?

Ask her out - somewhere public, where it's easy to come and go, and where you can be active enough to do more than stare at each other and feel like an interview. Ice skate. Local museum. Doesn't have to be anything you are good at. Just a venue to interact.

"I worry about him having any visitation until we have a custody order. I was advised that until there is one in place, he could refuse to give the kids back to me. Given his past threats, I think it's a possibility. "
"&gt;It was upsetting him that the guy looked at me that way without even thinking that maybe he was my boyfriend. 

He's not your friend OP, he's waiting for a relationship, and using manipulation to try and get you into one. I know you feel bad and want to help him, but you have to understand that you are not qualified to help him.  

You have to move out. Seriously. This is not going to get better, he is going to continue doing this."

If he isn't greatly disturbed by what happened, determined to curb his drinking and control himself better, get yourself out of this relationship."
It's highly unusual to want a 2 year old at a nice restaurant. For anybody there but the clueless/rude parents
He told you it was too expensive and so deal with it yourself. You are nothing more than a hookup that's just lasted a really long time.  
"He thinks it's ok, because it is. Nothing bad happens. He gets to have his cake and eat it too. You seriously need to kick this dude to the curb. "

Oh yah, such a ""taker""-- $100/mo doesn't go anywhere close to covering the cost of supporting OP.  OP's mom shares freely and supports OP, and then is lectured about taking OP to buy a cable so she won't use OP's PS4 anymore :P"
"Okay it's not a big gap between 24 and 29 but there's definitely an emotional gap here. For some reason she's 29, an ""adulty adult,"" has her OWN place (does she have roommates there or something?), but is consciously choosing to hang around ""young adults."" If she doesn't like she can fuck off. Don't limit yourself for her benefit. If she tells you to grow up you can ask why she's hanging out in a four person apartment instead of her OWN place. "
"Agreed. Trust me, I am under no Illusion that I'm good with finances. I'm working on changing that this year."

You don't need to talk to her ever again, you don't need to marry her or whatsoever but if you told her you would pay for it, pay for it! 

If you don't pay for it, she will tell this to others, she will feel that you will put this money higher than ever having contact to her again and it will drive an irreversible wedge between you two and all the people that hear about this will automatically consider you as the bad guy. 

So keep it simple, stick to your word, pay for it and go on no contact for a while! "

""Yes"" I thought you didn't smoke, why do you have a lighter? So you and your other boyfriend can smoke after sex?  ""Yes"".  You're going out with friends tonight, why? You know I can't go out tonight cuz it's my weekend with my kids. Is it To pick up guys?  ""Yes"" You didn't answer your phone at 6 this morning, you must've Had a long night with another guy last night"". ""Yes.""

I ended up dumping him which led to him stalking me which in turn led to me getting a restraining order against him. Fuck if I'm going to justify my actions when I'm doing nothing wrong. Go fuck your self. 

If you don't confront this head on now it is just going to escalate. "
"You sound like you want the fun parts of being a parent and none of the work of co-parenting. You should really know better. Of course she’ll move to be near her family. But child support usually comes with custody agreements. Also by the way, infants and children are a LOT of work. "
"Seattle, actually, but good to know!"
"EDIT: Regardless of what happens, I just realized you said ""they set her up with someone."" I totally missed that. Actually, I change my advice. This went from her hiding you and not causing any damage to anyone except you and herself (which is something ultimately, if you decide to accept, is your prerogative) to having another person actively being lied to and harmed. This now is beyond the scope of reasonable and needs to end.

Put your foot down, and if she won't budge, tell her parents yourself. This is unacceptable and is causing harm to another person now in the process. "

"I kind of assumed they were just sending them to everyone or their stories or feeds or whatever, but if they specifically chose to send them to you guys that's pretty rude."
"With those statements, you are playing judge and jury.  That is not your job.  When my first boyfriend raped me, most of our friends didn't believe me.  He was the sweetheart of the group, the guy who made sure all the drunk girls got home safe, the guy who would diffuse tense situations when we were out in a calm manner, the guy who everyone leaned on for help.  NO-ONE had an easy time reconciling that guy, with the guy who violently raped me, ripped hair from my head, and smashed my face into a wall.  No-one believed it, because people can be very very good at hiding who they are.

Her past behavior is not yours to judge either.  You don't know what happened behind their closed doors, especially if what you know of her is heresay (especially from him).  Maybe he lashed out in self-defense, maybe not.  That's not for you to judge.

You can support him by listening but NOT PASSING JUDGEMENT.  Do not take anyone's side.  And I really, strongly recommend you stay away from the courthouse.  Several of our friends went to court when my rapist was finally brought to trial after raping a second and third girl.  Their faces were recognized and they were pinpointed as people who supported a rapist, after not believing me when I told them.  They lost most of their friends and were often hounded by media.  Two of them moved away.

You can support him from outside the courthouse and reserve your judgement of him until the courts give their judgement.  "
"Hey, as long as y'all are still fuckin and enjoying it who gives a shit how it happens lol"
"I'll add that if he's bothered by any of that, it's a red flag and it's his problem, not yours."
"I worked with schizophrenic people in the past. While there are cases in which they become violent, most of them suffer from becoming a victim of violence because of their illness. There is a tiny fraction that becomes offenders.
Schizophrenia is one of the illnesses that goit demonized by the media, we prefer to be scared of sick individuals and outsiders instead of seeing that ""normal"" people commit most of the atrocities in this world.

That being said, I can understand reluctance and not risking anything with a child of this age. I would want to get to know that person moving in as a father to come to a decision together. And the two months assumption are very naive.

Due to her former homelessness it is quite likely she has some bad memories to cope with, and it will be tough for her to find her way back into a job and independence.

But even if you decide against letting her live with you, treating her with kindness and meeting friends and people who don´t stigmatize her, experiencing some normality and warmth, will help her getting better."
"I can do the math. It's about this pressure that people here create to unquestionably accept full sexual liberation, no matter how comfortable the OP is about it. It's up to OP to decide if it's alarming or not. She's allowed to have her own opinions about sexuality that doesn't conform to modern hookup culture."
"The details about your father are unbelievably inappropriate. You totally have a right to be upset about that. The thing about the sex is a bit more nuanced. If you never had the discussion with him that it's not okay to talk about, then honestly you need to give him a bit of the benefit of the doubt there. Some people are very open about their sex lives. It's how at least most of my friends and I operate. If someone I have been with is ever uncomfortable, then obviously I don't say anything. But that's a boundary which needs to be set. 

The thing about your father, though, that's a red flag and a huge issue. If this is the first time in your 3 years this has happened I wouldn't go nuclear. If you have a personal discussion, lay out boundaries and generally trust him/he's remorseful here, you can move on from this. "
whoops i missed that 
This isn't the time or place for random hypotheticals. OP is in actual danger. Don't be daft.

"OK, so there are two issues here, and they are resolved separately.

The firs tissue is that Jay didn't get his bonus of $50, and that should be resolved **immediately**. The owner should know that Jay says his card wasn't in his desk, and that he didn't get his Christmas bonus. The owner should get another $50, and see that it is delivered *directly into Jay's hands*. No cards in desks, no letters or envelopes, but a personal handing over of cash. 


The next thing you need to do is talk with the owner about having some better physical asset controls. Cash needs to be locked up, as do checks, with a very limited number of people who have access to it. Employee paychecks, as well as any bonuses, should either be handed directly to the staff or mailed to their address on file. 

Does the office have a security system? It might be time to invest in one. The nice thing about those systems is that each employee has their own key code, which means you not only know if someone came in when the office was closed, you know *who* came and went and *when*. 

Employee theft happens because of three things: opportunity, pressure, and rationalization. You can't control the pressures that an employee might be under, and you have no way to know what they're rationalizing to themselves, but you absolutely can and **should** limit their opportunities. You've already done this with petty cash, and you should look at other ways a person could steal from the company, and find ways to limit them. 

""Trust"" is no longer an adequate security policy. "
"Thank you! This hits it on the head for me. She knew I wasn't very confident with it, knew it was from a medical disaster as a child and neglect from my mom but still mocked it with a friend who has called me ugly in the past. I appreciate your empathy"
"&gt; She's even walked in the room and snapped my old headsets to bits.

Intentional destruction of your personal property is a huge red flag. She sounds extremely immature, being unable to comprehend that your every waking moment doesn't have to revolve around her. You use your time gaming to hang out with your friends, and assuming you aren't doing this every night of the week she should respect your choice.

I would sit down and explain it to her that this is part of who you are, and that you have no intention of changing. Tell her how you use that time to maintain friendships and bond with others. If she can't handle that then she needs to leave, and if she takes/destroys anymore of your property you need to drop her ***immediately***, and consider going to the police if what she breaks is of any significant value (PC, gaming system)."
You saying that doesn't change your situation at all. 
YES. This is what I come for when I sort r/relationships by controversial 
"You also mentioned ""my child"" and that you want ""your child to grow around you"" and that you don't want him/her going back and forth . I'm sorry but that's totally not for you to decide and it's a very unhealthy point of view. You seem like you are in denial of the fact that you are not going to be the one to call all the shots here and that your husband , albeit all the pain he's caused you, will be just as much a parent as you are . 

Look its not worth it keeping a marriage for this kid if you're both miserable , but for the sake of your child you two need to learn how to get along and work together for his/her benefit . "
Do you think I should start by telling my local police or his? He lives in a city 700 miles from me. The city he lives in is one of the top cities on that list I made of cities that he has rental listings in. My city isn't even on the list and to my knowledge he hasn't scammed anyone in my city.
"I think the coworker is out of line here, but white privilege absolutely is a huge issue and if you don't think white people enjoy benefits based on their skin color and if you don't think racism is alive and well, I don't know what world you're living in."
"I guess I don't understand why this is your responsibility. I can understand his desire to protect her and give in to her. Barely. But why do you have to put up with her bullshit if he isn't even around? If he wants to help her so much then he can go over to visit her at her house or have her over when he is home.  Maybe one day a week for a few hours so the kids can swim. 

I can't even imagine expecting someone to change their behaviors in their own home and if someone walked in on me while I was breastfeeding topless I might have had an actual stroke. 

I became an empty nester this year so I spend a lot of time thinking about when my kids were babies. I feel like I would give anything to have that time back so don't waste one second of these precious moments letting another person force their way in and ruin it. Breastfeed your babies as long as you and your doctor feel it is healthy. Wear whatever bathing suit you feel like wearing. And don't let people come into your home and ruin your peace and quiet. 

I will tell you something else. Most of the things I obsessed about when my kids were young ended up being meaningless. Maybe I'm wrong and those things helped shape them into the great adults they are today but I'm pretty sure they didn't. I met many parents with kids the same age as mine in play groups and we all had very different parenting styles. Our kids all turned out pretty much the same. 

The best advice I can give is don't take any shit from your kids and don't let them watch you take shit from other people. If your SIL can't treat you with respect then don't bring her into your home. "
Yeah I think it hit her when I asked her “you want me to move out of my own house?” It seems spinning and hiding has really caused her to lose herself. She’s not talking to me tonight
"He might not realize that he made you feel uncomfortable. I would let him know that he did, and hopefully he is genuinely sorry.

If it happens again, raise your voice and make it very clear that what he is doing is not okay. If he reacts adversely to that then you have a problem. But I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt for now."
"But you did and it probably destroyed trust permanently.

You should apologize for being so completely full of shit and treating her like she's a moron. You should tell her you were wrong and dishonest, and that you will now attempt to be truthful, if she is willing to hear you out. (She might not be. Deal with it.) You should tell her what you actually want, which is feet, and just own the damn issue. Is that going to make it better? No. Probably not. She's still almost certainly leaving you and she's probably right to do that for herself. But at least you'll have been half-way decent about it."
"Is it possible that you are not really falling in our even out of love, rather you are unconsciously using relationships to mask the feelings of depression and anxiety. So when the euphoria of something new and exciting wears off, you end up in a worse state because the contrast between how you were previously feeling before the relationship is heightened by the dissapointment that the relationship did not privide sifficient distraction for your previous unhappy state?


You are not happy and were never happy to begin with. Like you said, relationships are supposed to provide some sort of reprieve from your unhappiness, but like any other temporary remedy, once it is removed, you return to the normal or even worse state. Maybe what you need to focus on is your own personal happiness, you as an individual and not you within the context of a relationship.
Just something for you to think about.

If I were you, I would go for therapy."
"&gt; acusing this guy of being gay

Your word choice here is really strange. No one is accusing him."
"Look, what she did was seriously messed up and not cool at all. Like when you cheated on her. Seriously messed up, not cool. She forgave you for that though. You stayed together. Do you think you can work through this? If she is able to work through you literally having sex with another woman, I think she deserves for you to hear her out. In her mind, there is a reason that she spit in your face. She probably knows that she overreacted, but there is still a reason. What she did in my opinion is not unforgivable. If it ever happens again, 100% unforgivable. 


What I think is confusing me here is that you are so busy being a victim of her action, that you have NO IDEA why it happened. You are so far out of touch with her feelings that it's ridiculous, man. I'm sorry that this happened to you, but how about trying to figure out what's wrong with your wife? Do you think that your boss would have fired you if you took a personal day? If you are a reliable worker, sometimes its ok to stay home and handle personal problems...like in the event that your wife says she wants a divorce. Saying that you ""had to get to work to keep your job"" is another indication that you are completely dodging this. "
"She sounds emotionally immature but its not a relationship killer unless it annoys you to death.   My wife has a huge crush on Tom Hardy and Karl Urban.   I could care less,   i rent movies with them on purpose to make her happy.    At the end of the day shes in my bed not theirs."
"You're so sweet :)  

I think that while your motivations are pure, doing this might change the dynamics of your friendship in unanticipated ways.  If you can somehow gift the money to them without them knowing it comes from you, that might be the ideal solution."
"Just talk to him. It not unreasonable to be like, “Hey, I know you still look at other women, but I’d feel better if you didn’t publicly like their near-nude photos.” It’s okay to set boundaries. "
"Yeah, sentiment and intentions play a part, but this is one of those cases where “if it’s the thought that counts, next time, think harder”"
"You mean like:

&gt; and he wants to go masturbate in the other room

That person specifically said that she'd be deeply hurt by her husband masturbating somewhere private."
"I disagree with others that she's reading too much into it. They're only saying that because we always assume talking about being gay is a hilarious joke, and that taking that seriously is ridiculous. You would be getting reamed out if you made the same jokes about a woman, why should it be different?

You made the mistake of thinking that because you were talking about a guy, she would find it funny. Some people would find it funny, but it's not funny to her. If she mentioned that a cute girl was flirting with you, would you make jokes all night about how you think she's attractive and asking her if you're blushing? I doubt it. Thinking about it from that lens, can you understand why she would be upset? She's having the same emotional reaction as if you tortured her all night with the idea that you wanted to be with some other girl. No wonder she had a panic attack and thought you wanted to leave. She felt massively disrespected and confused that you were blatantly expressing interest in someone else to her face. The gender of the person has nothing to do with it.

All you can do is apologize and tell her you were 100% joking and that you won't say things like that again."

"There are red flags all over the place here, and it’s only two months in. Dump and run. 

- Constantly tracking you, doing check ins to make sure you know she’s watching you, is controlling behaviour 
- Ignoring your right to privacy. Look, my husband and I share our locations with each other and have for many years, but only because we mutually agree on it. At no point in time would either of us say something dismissive like “if you have nothing to hide you shouldn’t be worried”. That is SO not true. People have a right to privacy whether or not they are doing anything wrong. It’s in the UN Declaration of Human Rights for a reason. 
- Trying to make you feel bad instead of addressing your concerns is not something a loving partner should do
- Your last statement about how sweet she is and how you always end up feeling like the bad guy even if you’re not doing anything wrong because she convinces you, is really freaking concerning. She is manipulative and she is gaslighting you. This is the beginnings of an emotionally abusive relationship. 

I know you really like her and she is a wonderful person the rest of the time so it doesn’t seem like it could be that serious, but a lot of times, people who are emotionally abusive don’t know that they are doing it. It’s something broken in them that makes them behave this way. Regardless of intent, the outcome is the same. 

You should be in the honeymoon period two months in. You shouldn’t be being made to feel confused and guilty about wanting your right to privacy, uncomfortable about how she’s making you feel bad about things you do that aren’t even wrong, feeling guilty about some missed texts, etc. This will only escalate and get worse. Please leave while you’re not too involved and block her so that she doesn’t talk you into giving it another chance. "
"Yeah...

I wish he also felt that way, but he has a bad habit of doing things without consulting me. "
"You should show her your ranking system and let her break up for you.

Honestly though that seems strange, but you do what you think is best for you. Just know if you don't have real feelings for anyone you shouldn't waste their time while you finish your ""pros and cons"" list so you can confirm what you already know. Relationships aren't based on logic and lists, if you don't feel a connection chances are a full ""pro"" column isn't going to change your view on them or make your relationship any better (as shown by J)."
"Yes, do this! He has no right to speak to you like that. Ask him to stop doing this politely and if he doesn't stop, ask to see his manager. If there is no manager to speak to just ask to be served by another person and if he makes scene, let him. It won't be you who's making things awkward, it will be him.
Because of him you walked 30 mins to get your lunch. Girl this is not acceptable. Stand up to him, he doesn't deserve to get away with stuff like that and I'm pretty sure he's doing this to other women as well so you'd be doing not only yourself a favour but them, too. "
"Ironically, it appears the other moms are a ""bad influence."" "
"It really is becoming more common. I have a 17 year old with a tremendous amount of freedom compared to his friends. I feel like he’s on a ridiculously short leash compared to what my life was like in high school.  As long as I was home before curfew no one cared where I was!Some of these kids are going to go to college in a year and a half and go completely crazy because they have every minute, every activity closely monitored by their mothers.  It’s truly crazy to me. 

Honestly the only things your wife is going to accomplish by being this parents is a kid with no life skills, because he’s not allowed to live, a kid that becomes extremely proficient at lying and a kid that can’t make a decision for himself because he’s never been allowed to.  

Family counseling is a must. "
"Betcha he had some ridiculous porno scenario in his head that he was hoping would come true. OP wakes up groggy, sees him watching, asks him to join. I guarantee he was hoping something would happen."
"Yikes.  My immediate feeling is that it's been 2 days and your fiance needs more time to cool off before you make any lasting decisions.  Not talking to your sister again is going to far, but I think it's important that you make it clear there is some kind of consequence to her if you truly believe she could have prevented the accident by being more careful.  Is she remorseful?  Has she tried reaching out to your fiance?

This is a shit situation for sure.  Tread carefully, and good luck..."
"Your fiance has had barely any time to grieve. Let her know that she doesn't have to spend time with your family until she ever feels more comfortable, but you still want a relationship with them. It isn't fair to ask you to to not have contact with your family unless they're toxic people, and this sounds like an accident. I would recommend little sister writing an apology letter to be delivered later or doing something indirect--I really doubt your fiance wants to see or talk to the person who killed her dogs right now. Support your fiance--don't minimize your sister's behavior. She **was** reckless. She killed two members of your fiance's family.

Just give her time to grieve but stand firm that you think it was an accident and punishing your entire family by not talking to them isn't fair."
"&gt;We haven’t had sex yet since we live a bit far from each (six hours), and we both go to school/work full-time (he also still hasn’t been tested and doesn’t want to use condoms so I’ve put my foot down until one of those gives).

Why in the name of heaven doesn't he just go get tested, and why does he refuse condoms? those are two HUGE red flags. "
"&gt;I have to admit that I cannot help feeling like the home is more the woman's domain and as long as I find something that meets our needs he should let me have a home I love.

Well that's an incredibly archaic, sexist, and limiting point of view. I don't know if you're a SAHM or not, but regardless of that, your husband still needs to live there, and yes, enjoy the space he lives in.

&gt;In my mind, our compromise should be an old house that's been updated. Unfortunately, our limited budget makes this tough (about $300-$325k in upstate NY where the taxes are astronomical,) 

So your options are already limited by your budget. You talk about ""old vs. new"" a lot, but don't mention size at all. Are these newer homes smaller than the old ones? Have smaller bedrooms? Less storage? My point is, you can make an old home look modern, or a new house look nostalgic with the right furniture and decoration. Figuring out how to maximize your living space within your budget seems like it would be the most important factor in choosing a new home. Which ultimately means, OP, you need to reign in your emotions. If your passing on houses well within your budget with lots of space and room for improvement because you're ""just not feeling it,"" you are as much a part of the problem as he is."
"Do not get married until/unless you fix some of the major issues you two are having. 

I would try couples therapy, and if that does not work, you're probably better off apart, since you'll be miserable if you end upo marrying him. "
You reap what you sow. Leave them alone.
"Sometimes guys just need their space yanno? If it was like once a week or more that would bother me but once every month or every few months? Shit I'd hope he would stay at his friends house at least once, I need my alone time too hahaha"
Thank you. I’ve found my new favourite sub! 
Tell them your cancelled the account because you can't afford it. Then don't cancel the account.
"&gt; Her bf is doing 1-2 applications per month. That isnt even trying.

that's not true at all. in some areas, for some positions, there are only 1-2 openings a month. applying to 100% of the positions is trying your hardest."
"My brother went through a similar phase, and he kept pushing and pushing.  If it comes down to it, you can gently say what my mum said; 

“You should not be self-conscious singing in church or at singalongs, but you shouldn’t try out for the Voice.”"
"So I went through something really similar a few years ago, I’m going to try to quickly run through it and then outline what I think worked best.

This girl in my SOs cohort look a liking to us, however she went from “you guys are cool let’s hang out sometime” to begging, then harassing and trying to manipulate my SO emotionally when we couldn’t hang out. (Like saying “ohhh you make me so sad, I’m so sad we can’t hang out”) She was going to his office constantly, and just...harassing him constantly to hang out over the course of a month to two. She also shifted focus from both of us to only focusing on my SO, so it was weird at the time but we didn’t want to ruffle feathers. We thought she was clingy, bc she also used to call me her “sister.”

It was nothing more than a weird situation until things changed one night. At a mutual friend’s, during drunk swimming, she came onto my SO right in front of me. Grabbed his dick and everything. I flipped my fucking shit and grabbed her, and told her if she touched him again she’d wish she’d never met either of us.

We packed our shit and got ready to leave, but I guess she wasn’t done. She cornered my SO again in the kitchen and tried to kiss him. He pushed her off and walked out to the car. She followed and tried to get in, but I came out and she backed off.

I can tell you we talked about it all weekend, and here’s how we decided to handle it.

First we contacted my SOs professor and disclosed what happened and referred to it as sexual harassment. We did not what her to control the narrative. My SO wrote up a short report of what had transpired and sent it to his PI.

Then we contacted her and told her that she was, under no circumstances, to contact either of us. Blocked her on everything. If they needed to speak or interact professionally, it would be done professionally in public and no more than absolutely required. 

I think the big thing is for you two to be united - that’s what made our situation so “easy”, we both knew we didn’t want her in our lives. Your SO needs to look beyond his feelings, or ego and see that she can compromise his relationship, his profession, and his reputation. Is that worth throwing away over some female attention? 

He should speak to a trusted individual in his cohort and decide if it’s worth making an informal report - we didn’t want to press charges, but we did want her behavior on record with the administration in case she flipped the story. 

He needs to commit to the idea she’s not a friend, she crossed a boundary and there’s no apology for that. He needs to block her. 

I can tell you that after it all went down for us, this girl (married btw and older than both of us) did leave us alone. But she tried to kiss our housemate a few months later. My housemate grabbed her by the back of the collar of her shirt and “scruffed” her off him like a dog, which was one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. Since then? She finally got pregnant and had a baby."
"Have an honest conversation with her. Tell her you were being irresponsible before. Tell her you didn't realize how interested she was in having a baby soon. Tell her you are NOT on the same page.

If you cannot have this conversation with her, you shouldn't have sex with her.

Eta: I'm a woman, but if I were a 25 year old guy, I wouldn't stop using condoms until I was getting married or ready to conceive."
"&gt;OP, you CLEARLY want people to tell you that Katharine is eviler than Skeletor.

No kidding, the title of the post misses the entire problem within it and is so deceiving. Your BF really sucks OP. "
"You think overpaid people who like their jobs shouldn’t have to do as many chores at home because their time is worth more? By your logic, she should do more at home because she has a harder job yet is underpaid for it. Doesn’t make any sense. Her free time is just as valuable as yours. "
"Assuming he was also the same age as the GF, it probably didn't cost him ""a shit-tonne"" of money, just a load of headache. If you don't have any assets to fight over (like most 19 year olds), then divorces are pretty cheap. "
"Why did you not set a hard boundary when these ""rules"" started popping up? "
"Thank you for your post. That's something I've never considered. You've done a good thing, bringing more empathy and compassion into this discussion. "
"The mom gave birth when she was 14 or 15, *years* younger than the OP is now.  The mom didn’t ask to get pregnant when she was barely past puberty.

A closed adoption should be upheld, period.  

OP’s parents ignored that, which is fucked up and possibly illegal.  And then OP did a ton of really fucked up things, too.  But the birth parents weren’t in the wrong at all."
"I'm sorry I disagree with the others and your assumption that it's *your* apartment. They definitely don't really see it as *yours*. They think of it as your parent's apartment. Sure they had to say the right things at the start to not upset you. Your older brother and girlfriend probably believe they have just as much right to live there as you. Consider that they had stitched this arrangment up well before mentioning it to you just before they returned home. The decision had already been made. I suspect your parents ultimately decide who lives there. 

You've mentioned that they pay their share and they've been there for 6 months. His girlfriend has moved your furniture against your wishes AND unpacked their kitchen things. Unfortunately you're too close to see what's happening. They've moved in and I suspect they have no intentions of moving out anytime soon. 

If your brother and girlfriend wanted to stay do you think your parents would support you in asking them to move out? "
"And let's not forget, any interest you show in any traditionally ""masculine"" hobby or pursuit, like sports, is A) Clearly faked just to impress boys and B) Shallow and lacking the depth of knowledge and appreciation a ""real"" (read: male) fan has for the topic and C) Volunteering to be grilled on the minutiae of said topic to ""prove"" you aren't a ""real"" (read: female) fan. So you can't relax and enjoy the hobby with other people of like minds, because you are posing liar who is just trying to keep up with the guys. 

But it doesn't end there! If your interests are stereotypically ""feminine"", like fashion, you are A) Shallow and basic and B) Too stupid/unsophisticated to appreciate ""real"" or ""important"" arts/movies/culture/whatever and C) Clearly only doing it to impress other people, not because you actually enjoy it.

...Is it possible that the guys who spout off about bullshit like ""fake gamer girls"" actually hate their professed hobbies and are only into them because they think that's what they should like, and are projecting their resentment of ""having"" to like ""guy stuff"" onto women who ""get"" to like ""guy stuff"" without fear of being accused of being gay? Cause if that's true, that would be really sad for them. If you want to crochet, crochet! No one's stopping you but you!"
"Caring for a child for 18 years, or even 25, or 30 if that turned out to be more convenient, is something I would gladly do. But having to care for someone for the rest of my life?

"My roomate's specific hobby is something called 'aquascaping' where it's more about the plants and kind of like underwater bonsai, so often he doesn't even have fish, but he just got a salt and is starting some coral colonies and those will take at least a year. For freshwater (much much less complicated and expensive) it usually takes him at least a month or two for any fish to go in."
"How much of this is your mom talking?

"&gt;should I try and focus on staying as stress free as possible for the sake of the baby?

Yep, put yourself first right now and don't get bogged down by his bullshit. Hopefully he has supportive parents who can buckle down on him and try to fix things to make sure you kid grows up with at least a half decent father, even if you two end up separated. But as it stands, this guy acted directly against the best interests of both you and your child and you shouldn't engage with him until you're through the woods of this pregnancy."
"Document everything including when you told your mom. If she continues to brush this off and he continues to escalate, things will get worse. If your mom won’t listen reach out to a school counselor. My abuser was well aware about my mom, he knew she had brushed off what I told her he was doing to me. Things got much worse fast. He took it as an invitation to do what he wanted and gloated about it to me while he hurt me. 

Tell your mom if she won’t listen to you that you’ll find someone who will. Reach out to your father. Whether your close or not, hr might be the one to stand up to him. Tell your sister and show her whatever he texts or messages you through any social media outlet. "
"Look, if she ever finds out this will do serious damage to your relationship. It won't be because you slept with a prostitute, it will be because you lied to her for so long. 

Personally I would never date a man who'd slept with a prostitute. But the way it happened for you sort of changes my view. If you had told her up front that you slept with a prostitute, hated it, and couldn't even finish she would probably have been fine. Now that you've kept it from her for so long be prepared: if she finds out she will be devastated and she most likely won't believe you when you tell her the experience was awful for you. 

Also to me it's a red flag that no one talks about what happened at the bachelor party. Did the bachelor cheat on his future wife? Did your cousins cheat on their SOs? If you partook in that experience and said nothing to the women who were cheated on that really colors my view of you. How would you feel if you knew your girlfriend went to a bachelorette party where all the girls were sleeping with male prostitutes and cheating and she said nothing? That's the biggest red flag to me. "
I don't think predatory instinct or behavior has anything to do with age. 
A beautiful gesture? No fucking way. It was stupid &amp; thoughtless. What should she have done? Put the octopus in the tank &amp; let it die in two days? The boyfriend is an idiot &amp; you’re clearly not a huge animal person. 
"If you're separated, you should separate your finances as well. Take out your other half of the savings account and move it to an account with your name on it before that disappears too. Then get a divorce lawyer if you don't have one already and tell them everything that's happened. "
"Thanks, I can. My lawyer said I have about six months (of which I'm about halfway through). I am just trying to get past the holidays right now. Of course he went out and spent an obscene amount of money to prove how ""commited"" to working it out he is. I wish I could be so heartless and say thanks, but get out... I'm just not strong enough to do that yet. 

My biggest challenge with pulling the trigger is really an overwhelming lack of support. We have done the split up get back together dance so many times that even most of friends don't believe me anymore, which really really makes it hard to actually go through with it... I completely understand why they would feel that way. I would feel the same if I wasn't the one in the situation. I just happen to be extremely strong and resilient in every other area of my life, but I cannot seem to kick the puppy out. He knows every soft spot I have and preys on my compassion. 

Even my brother whom I've always been close to has stoped speaking to me once he found out that I chickened out again!! I hate how weak I am. "
"just lie and say you are canceling it/going to cancel your account. Say you might re-open is when a new show comes out and then you will give your brother the account info when you ""reopen"" it. Hopefully they will forget about it then. If they do remember in the future just lie and say you decided to never renew you account. "
"OP, please focus on this comment. From your girlfriend's perspective, your actions were incredibly hurtful. Be prepared to apologize and recognize that you may have lost some trust here that you'll need to work to regain. She has spent the rest of her birthday time wondering what's wrong and possibly feeling bad about herself --- or feeling badly about you, or both."

"I mean, it’s not a slur I’ve ever heard used, but it’s definitely used in a racist way. Like if his girlfriend was Mexican and they were like, “How are you and Taco?” It’s dehumanizing and just...just super blatantly racist and gross. "
There have been circumstances where people on Craigslist have lured “nannies” into bad situations. That’s a red flag to me. Does she usually stay out with your car? That seems really disrespectful. 
"He's invalidating your feelings, which is disgusting. He isn't a native and doesn't have the right to speak for them all. Honestly, if he truly believes this, you have some huge incompatibilities and ending the relationship would be the best thing for both of you. His pride and ignorance isn't something you have to put up with. You deserve better!"
"&gt;“saw so and so’s girlfriend with two guys” he’d “take a photo and send it to her bf too”. 

Oh, so he's dumb as shit. Sorry OP, there's no cure for ignorant."
"I finally have a title for what I am. A ""single-parent-while-married"". Awesome.


Great, solid advice. "
"1. He went without me for the first few days and then i would fly out and join him. In all honesty I have been the stick in the mud about christmas as i have never once spent a Christmas eve out of town.

2. I will. I think that will be a good way to get him to firmly articulate what a mommy's boy he is being and then i can repeat it back to him.

3. I am, but i find that sub a bit over the top with the hate and vitriol for the MILs. My MIL isnt batshit crazy. I just dont want her on my couch watching tv loudly six weeks out of the year. 

4. He is aware im not keen on spending time with his parents and he is sympathetic as they drive him batty too. I think i should explain how i feel exactly to him.

Lol and saying it was only 1 glass of wine when it was like a 16 ounce solo cup filled to the brim lol (which is technically 3.2 drinks)
"It doesn't strike me as a ""hey look who I saw""  type thing because her bf said he'd do the same thing if he saw his friends' girlfriends with other guys "
"Thank you - as much as I wish this wasn't true, I am really starting to feel like it is the case.  Lately when I've been trying to talk with him about it, he's getting very short toward me - while giving his mom exactly what she wants.  It never started as a 'pick me over her' scenario...I really came at this from a 'there's no reason you should be baring this guilt, and I'm angry that you feel guilty for no reason, and your mom needs to take responsibility for filling her life up with other good things and not just counting on you' and it's morphed into such a weird dynamic."
"Don’t. Let him reach out to you first. He cut off contact, let him re-establish "
"This, OP. If so, she is likely pissed off at having to do all this work and is transferring her anger at you onto James."
"Oh sweetie, this is not your fault !  It’s not your fault for trying to help someone who refuses to help himself.  And if he refuses to help himself, he will drag you down with him if you let him.  Don’t let him.  He has broken his marriage vows to you.  That’s not your fault.

Please get some therapy.  Read up on codependence because I can see those destructive thought patterns.  I was the same way with my loser, selfish, lazy ex but you know what ?  After I left him, people, friends, others came out of the woodwork to tell me that I did the right thing.  That he was no good for me.  That I didn’t have to sacrifice my entire life to prop him up.  Some therapy will help you get through this.  Please talk to someone.  You deserve peace. 🙂"
"So do you like her romantically, or do you love her as a sister? In your post you said both.

Like...are you sexually attracted to her?

Did you literally tell her that her more explicit statements were grossing you out? That's what's really making me doubt the sexual attraction possibility here. Or maybe you didn't choose a precise enough word? I am trying to put myself in the situation of a teenager whose friend announced this stuff out of the blue, but I didn't find them unattractive. I think I would say ""shocked"" and ""surprised"" and ""awkward"" sooner than I would say ""grossed out"". I'd reserve that for somebody who I would shudder to imagine naked.

What exactly is your question to us? Do you want some help processing your feelings about her? Do you want to talk sample scripts for how to talk to her again after reducing her to tears with your reaction? Or maybe you really don't want to talk to her again like she suggested.

Poor thing. I know she sprung it on you out of nowhere, according to your post, so I feel sorry for you too, but mostly I feel sorry for her. She bared her soul to you and you expressed disgust. That's hard to come back from."
"If you two hang out it’s possible that this is her way of teasing banter. Clearly it’s crossed the line. I’d tell her from ‘a friend place’ next time she says something “okay, that’s enough.” Or “and I thought whites were racist.” If it is malicious, a simple “stop, you’re done” when she starts might do it. If she’s  bullying you with it, then HR. "
Regarding the lingerie that looked washed... I always wash lingerie before wearing it.  My husband bought me some for Christmas that had evidence of being tried on... 
People with no experience with legal careers or law school should really not give advice to this specific career choice. Your last paragraph is such bad advice it's remarkable. 
"Every single relationship will start to fall to pieces if you don't do ""maintenance"" on it.

Maintenance is damn easy in the honey moon phase. You want to please the other and maintenance doesn't feel as a chore.

After a while the honey moon phase goes away and things you both did just because now take effort. Because you never did them for yourself in the first place.

I've been with my wife for 7 years and while I love her, not everything I do for her is a pleasure to me. Sometimes it bothers me. She does stuff that pisses me off. I do to.

The thing is to communicate about expectations. You don't seem to have done that much with him. Talk about what is working or not. What you or him need in the relationship to be happy. Determine if it's something you're both ready to do and act accordingly.

It's very easy to become barely more than room mates after a while and romance takes a bit of an effort to make happen now. Plan dates like before! Do nive stuff!

As long as there's respect and love and no deal breaker it's nearly always a matter of communication. Every long term couples go through that."
Dude... you're like 30. Sleeping with your friends lil sis. Either become bf/gf and tell him together or move on
"I agree with the other comment that animal and human aggression are different, but DO NOT let children crawl all over your dog, no matter what breed."
"You can't seriously expect him to ever want to be near that animal again. Explain and rationalize it all you want-- ""high prey drive"", it's his fault for not watching them-- but he watched YOUR animal kill HIS beloved cat. Try empathy for a chance, instead of trying to bargain with him for forgiveness. You have to ask yourself: do you love your boyfriend more than your dog? Who can you not live without? You should also consider that this dog is probably unsuitable for children, if that is something you want in the future. Kids don't respect boundaries. Your dog is highly possessive over some belongings-- he doesn't like strangers messing with his belongings-- this is a huge red flag for me."
"It sounds like she's distancing herself from you to make the move easier on herself, if not for both of you.
It also sounds like she's moving on to the idea of just not having you in her life.

I'm sorry buddy, I think it's time for you to break up with your girlfriend and start the needed process of healing and self-growth. Unfortunately I think she chose her career and Europe over your relationship, as sad as it is. I'm sorry."
"That's really good to hear.

Something I will say: a lot of people here are talking about the fact that he could be infatuated with you, or he could be trying to manipulate you etc etc etc...

This did come across to me too. Bad mental health can turn you into a selfish, clingy asshole without even realising it. From my experiences, It's like... the ""feelings"" part of your brain goes haywire, so you start offering certain maladjusted behaviours to try and self medicate the fact that your ""feelings"" are all wrong.

If these behaviours are validated (for example: if you cut down on your social life), they might be offered again.

I'm not going to cast judgment on your friend - if you're acting the way he is, something has gone very wrong, and you need doctors, and friends with strong boundaries who don't take your bullshit but will still go for coffee with you. 

But - as his friend I really want you to be aware of the fact that he may offer these harmful behaviours, and make sure you can identify them and not validate them - both for your sake and his.

Edit: I also really want you to know, that it's at the end of the day, not your problem. If it gets too much for you, or you don't want to have to deal with this, you absolutely should not have to do that. "
"True feminism is the right to decide how you want to live your life, and if that means housewife, so be it. However!

But your boyfriend needs to know your intentions, because it's unfair to him if he's expecting you to work and bring in money and you have no intention of doing so. If you're not going to work, and you don't have any stable sources of money, it means he'll be doing all the financial support.  "
"I lived with two people. They were a couple. I was single and was dating; I didn't always come home at night and the male roommate started to freak out a lot;

""Why are you wearing that?""
""Why are you going out with him?""
""You look like a slut dressed like that,""

And it slowly got worse and worse until he was calling me a whore and tramp and his girlfriend joined in. I laughed it off because I didn't see it for what it was: I jokingly called myself it. But there's a difference in calling yourself names to reclaim them and having others call you them maliciously. 

It all came to a head when he tried to kiss me on a night out and I turned him down. Then he started amping it up: locking me in my room, slamming cupboard doors when I reached for them, pushing me out of rooms and aggressively kissing and groping his girlfriend in front of me. I got out of there and OP I think you should too before my story becomes yours. 

His girlfriend still thinks I'm a whore btw. And her boyfriend tried to hit on my best friend and got mad when she rejected him too. "
"&gt; but that he is emotionally numb and feels totally lost in life, in general.

Ugh. So this was expressed to you and you spend the next paragraph or two of your post just talking about yourself. So many ""I"" statements and what ""I think"" or ""I feel this/that"". Learn to have a little humility and empathy. This man had a 15 year relationship and that's something you do not understand.

Back off and go find some people on your own emotional maturity level. "
"Your girlfriend sounds like she wants the cute cuddly part of a dog without the hard work.

Yes, it isn’t her dog, but, if the dog means so much to you I would hope that she would put in some effort. 

Can you guys do things together with your pup? If he is being destructive because of a lack of stimulation, can you take him for a walk together or play ball together? Is she willing to take the trainers advice and provide consistency for your pup? 

Now, from your girlfriends point of view, are you committed to training? Are you practicing with your pup outside of the schedule obedience training? Are you being consistent with your training? "
"Thanks, I'm very glad we divorced.  It's hard financially but I know my children are much better for it - as am I.   My only regret is not leaving much sooner."
"Nope. He’s an adult, he should be able to handle it in a healthier way. There is no excuse for him to be treating you like this. All of us experience hardships, many people go through things much tougher than parents getting divorced long after becoming adults, and nothing is an excuse for refusing to work, making your working wife do all the housework, spending money you don’t have on pot and booze, selfishly risking the lives of others while driving drunk, and being an ungrateful, entitled jerk to you on top of all of that. I know breakups are tough, but you *know* you deserve better and now that the hard part of separating has passed, don’t go back and have to do it all over again. "
"Hell yes. He deserved to be hurt! He didn't just ""threaten"" her, either, he attacked her in the middle of the woods. "
"&gt;The most recent conversation involved plans to have phone sex, and it was made very clear that if they were not so far from each other that it would be physical. 

there isnt much to confront. I would check with a lawyer FIRST and then serve her the papers."
"This is partially right. Find someone who respects you and your interests enough to not make fun of you. He doesn't have to believe in it, but should at least not think less of you  for believing in it. It sounds like he thinks you'll grow out of it eventually and that he thinks you're an idiot. Good luck if you stay, you guys need to seriously talk. Or just be petty and make fun of him for liking mayonnaise, or for wearing a blue shirt, or for liking video games. See how ridiculous it is? It really is that you shouldn't be with someone who makes fun of you with the intention being to make you look bad. You're serious contemplating marrying someone who bullies you and thinks less of you. "
"I'm sorry to say this, but your boyfriend is an asshole. If he doesn't respect your sexual boundaries, he's basically acting like he's entitled to your body whenever he wants. It seems like in his world, it's his way or the highway. If you don't want to watch a certain movie or have sex with him, he is NOT entitled to a long, exhausting explanation to why you don't want to do that activity with him. 

Since you've been in a relationship with him for four years, I can see why he feels like he's entitled to have everything his way. In long term relationships, it's often hard to remind yourself that you are a separate person from your partner. So, if you continue to let him get away with him being an asshole towards you, he will continue to act entitled, unfortunately.

In my personal opinion, you're too young to be stuck in a relationship where your significant other doesn't respect you as an autonomous individual. However, if you make the decision to stay with him, I recommend that you look inwards and think about what boundaries you want to form for yourself. Then, have a conversation with him about your boundaries and ENFORCE THEM. I know it's hard, but if you don't do it now, it will just get harder later. 

Just remember that at the end of the day, you deserve to have your own opinions and feelings about things. You deserve to have a relationship where your partner respects you as an individual!

"My thoughts exactly. I would love to read the brother's POV because the things he was saying don't sound like normal insults for people you dislike. Sounds like there's a longer history that OP is not sharing. Or maybe is not even aware of - especially with the ""she's gonna make it all about herself again"" comment it kinda sounds like she may not even realise how her behaviour is perceived by her brother/ others. 

Or maybe the brother is just an insane person, who knows. "
"I guess I'm in the minority, but if my bf told me he drank too much at a female coworker/friend's house and stayed the night on the couch, I'd just be glad he didn't drive. I honestly wouldn't be upset. Your boyfriend sounds really jealous, from this situation and the other things you've written. I'm sorry you're going through this, but I'd say to either have a big talk with your boyfriend about how his distrust makes you feel, or break up with him. Other people are saying to text first, but I'm a massive lightweight and tend to fall asleep after one strong drink, so I feel like when you're drUnk and tired, that's not usually your first thought. "
"Of course you don't have to give up one of your dogs to her.

When it comes to your mutual friends, I'm so sorry that they are taking her side on things. If you interact with them and they ask you about her, stick with the truth without badmouthing her. Be consistent with your answers.

But for the most part, you should understand that while you got to keep the dogs in the breakup, you might not have been able to keep the friends. It's pretty common to lose friends during a breakup, especially in a tumultuous one, people often pick sides.

But one thing, I re-read your post three times looking for this. *Are you still living with her parents?* You don't say anywhere about moving out after you broke up. If you are still living with her parents, I can see why your friends believe her when she says that you are colluding with them. It looks super weird, and I would have a hard time believing your side of the story as well if I was one of your friends, because it looks like you are simply camping out waiting for her to come back."
You are very welcome.
"I just wanted to second this.  Again, all situations are not the same - but this post could have been written by me - 8 years ago.

"/u/time_keepsonslipping is right, this is not a FERPA violation and talking about FERPA will just make you seem like you don't know what you are talking about but you want to be litigious. If they don't want to play ball OP should threaten them with the media, instead. Even though there's very likely no legal recourse here, a news story about this would look awful for the school/principal/board.  "

I find it hard to believe they don't know of their son's behavior towards his sister. They are either extremely obtuse or have been ignoring this. I agree that you need to stop covering for him. Tell them you are not going and say exactly why.  But also, I would also be prepare for them to dismiss or try to guilt trip you to go anyway because ""FAMILY"". "

"OP never says 'replace existing furniture', she says 'buying furniture we need' .... I think its pretty clear that they did not have perfectly functional furniture before. Ffs, she had to buy cutlery and he wouldnt contribute to the cost of that.

"well they've been dating 4 months, just cause they have a past doesn't mean he is necessarily 'her future' and 'the universe is shoving them together' either.

I also grew up in a cult-like religious group and dated lots of other ex-members of that group cause we had a lot in common. I ended up marrying someone who grew up very religious and left it, but didn't grow up in my religion...personally I'm happy I don't have long term ties to the particular cult I grew up in (other than my side of the family lol), but I know lots of people who married other ex-cult members cause that's who they were most similar to.

yeah silverware = cutlery.
"Yeah look there are a lot of comments saying otherwise, so paying her back is clearly the *right* thing to do. But would I? Hell no. She used you and dumped you. And, you can't afford it right now. Don't set yourself on fire to keep your ex warm. "
The only right thing to do is to end this relationship and help your ex press assault charges against him
"I think the commenters here might have a different opinion if you included everything that happened at the end of your relationship. It seems like you want the commenters to validate you paying her back. If you want to pay her, go for it. If you feel like she cheated, abused you (you alluded to something like this) and you want nothing to do with her now: then tell her sorry, it’s not happening, and block her. You’re not a “bad” person either way. Another way to look at it is: will you regret not paying her back? If you will, then pay her. If you don’t care (seems like you do), then tell her too bad. 
"
"When a teacher notices a kid’s behaviour change dramatically or if their academics suddenly start declining, we are absolutely within our everyday normal boundaries to ask the kid how they are doing. We are mandated to get to the bottom of red flags for any kind of abuse. 

This teacher was careless. She assumed she was looking out for the well-being of the kid, and is either young and inexperienced, or just wasn’t thinking when she took one parent’s side. 

Normally, even with the knowledge I had been given from the sister, I’d ask the kid open ended questions like this; “Hey dude, I noticed you’re quiet lately, not playing with so and so as much, and you’re not getting as much work done. That happens to me too when I’m upset about life things. Do you want to talk about anything?” 

If he said no, I’d regularly remind him that I care, and I’m there to listen. Or I’d offer for him to speak with our school’s admin or another staff he might feel more comfortable with. 

The majority of parents are awesome, but regularly enough (that I’ve seen it multiple times in 10 years) when a dramatic behaviour change occurs it is because something terrible has happened to that kid. Encouraging them to talk to someone they are comfortable with has gotten many kids out of terribly abusive situations."
"With the 7 year age gap, he was probably looking for someone that was ""fun"" and cared about him all the time. Now it's the children that get the attention and he's acting as an immature parent. 

Side note: If you had been dating/married a few years, its kinda creepy for a dude to be hitting on college-level students. "
"If you're feeling depressed, isolated and left out, there is an objective problem with her behavior, and you should do something about it before you decide it's simply too much and pack your bags. 

She sounds like she's obsessed with her activity. Passion is good, obsession is not. The difference between the two is that the important person of her life don't feel cast out of it because of the subject of interest. 

You need to make her understand this is threatening your relationship. You need to tell her you basically don't feel like you're a part of her life anymore, and that even if that's not true in her opinion, your perception matters (it is going to matter if you decide to leave), and she needs to hear you out.

To the arguments that 

1) you don't respect what's important to her

2) you're blowing this way out of proportion

3) she has obligations to the club/her friends, what will they think if I stop coming etc...

...just stick to the message: the way things are currently going is making you consider stepping out if her life completely. 

You're not asking her to stop everything, you made a real effort because you knew this was important to her, but right now the situation is making you suffer and you'd rather she helped that stop then take matters into your own hands and simply leave.

There's a slightly cultist aspect to her 'family' (though try not to mention it to her, it won't help with the argument), which is having the effect your seeing; you're either completely in or you're out. She may not yet realize this, and you need to help her with that. You have to show her what she has to lose by devoting herself to her 'family' at the price of everything else."

What in the world attracts you to this shithead?
"What's your wife's plan? Watching this woman 24 hours a day to make sure nothing happens? Even if she had the time for that, she can't stop this woman from having another episode.

OP, you've gotten good advice in this thread on alternative options. But I'm curious why your wife is pushing this to the point of stupidity ... because putting her family's safety and security at risk is stupid. Is she usually reasonable and make good decisions? Why **this** friend, who your wife hasn't seen in ten years? What's the real motivation here?

I ask because humans can be weird creatures who make decisions by emotion, not logic. And if you want to break through to your wife, it may help knowing WHY she's so adamant on this ridiculous plan.

I'll go one step further: if your wife insists on moving this person in, take your daughter and stay elsewhere until this friend is out of your house. You need to protect your kid if your wife won't come to her senses."
"Also, by the sounds of it, OP's wife's friend doesn't have a job, or not a stable one, assuming they are in the US or somewhere else where healthcare and medication are not free/low cost, how is she paying for her medication, i.e. how *reliable* is it that she can even afford to get her script on time every month, before we even get into issues of if she's able to do it (what's her executive function/working memory like, does she ever only realise she's down to her last tablet on the day she's due to take it, does she need to see her doctor each time she needs a prescription, how easy is her doctor to access...) 

I'm not in the US so IDK much about the mechanics of it, but I do know that, anecdotally, I know quite a number of people in the US in precarious employment/on low incomes/etc who do not have any... is it Medicare? Medicaid? Basically they can't access any of the programs that might help with this stuff (again, not in the US, i'm not sure if these programs even *do* help with the cost of prescriptions/routine appointments) so they have to find a not insignificant amount of money each month for medication. If an unexpected expense occurs, they are pretty well screwed.

As a lot of people have said, it's a very kind impulse of OP's wife to want to offer this help to her friend, but I just don't think it's a good idea, there are too many ways for it to go wrong, even if it's 'only' something like 'she couldn't find a job and we had her staying with us for a year and it was incredibly stressful and annoying for us all.' (Particularly as this is someone she has recently got back in touch with - it's not like it's someone she has seen regularly over the past few years, that OP knows reasonably well, who the kid is familiar with.)"
"Now that you say it, that definitely sounds like something that could happen.

The wife thought that asking the husband would just be a formality, she was not expecting any kind of pushback from him on it. 

He clearly need to talk to her and make her understand that this isn’t flippant. It is a very serious decision they need to consider together and be on the same page about. "
"As a side note, don’t tarnish all people with mental illness like this. Most of us want and get help others are so ill that they can’t normally see the best way of taking care of themselves.

For example, my mum is schizophrenic, she refuses meds because she believes it’s the doctors trying to take control and takeaway her ‘real’ thoughts because taking them makes her forget the ‘real truth’. She doesn’t believe she is ill and can take a funny turn randomly. I, on the other hand, suffer with anxiety and depression and some paranoia and ask for medication because putting others through the awfulness that is dealing with me through the worst episodes isn’t worth not taking it. 

We are all different."
"It is downright weird for an adult to expect piggyback rides as actual... rides, to cover significant distance. I mean as part of horsing around, sure. But not as actual transportation, which is what you're saying.

I can't wrap my mind around this tbh. Someone said that it might be making her feel dainty, if she really is overly self conscious about her height, and that might be it because otherwise... idk. 

Look, I regularly give a 6 year old piggyback rides. Short ones. And then I tell her to hop off cause it's tiring. I'm 6 feet tall and relatively fit. You've boxed yourself into this odd stance by assuming that your gf will take your refusal as some kind of insult regarding her monstrous size, but seriously... tell her you're tired.  Tell her your back is sore. Tell her whatever, stop carting her butt around like a mule."
"I don't think it's necessarily something you *have* to overcome. Personally, I like short men. I'm not attracted to tall (think 6'0"" or over) men at all, even if they're otherwise fantastic. It just doesn't do it for me. I could try to force it and date some hapless tall man in the hope something would click, but if it doesn't then I just wasted his time and led him on, when I could have been dating a short guy I actually like, and he could have been dating a girl who really genuinely finds him sexy.

If it really bothers you the best suggestion I have is to expose yourself to lots of attractive short men (whether they be celebrities or real life) and see if that jumpstarts something for you. But don't force it. If it doesn't do it for you, it doesn't do it for you."
"How long have you been with your GF? Can you get some emotional support from her if you need it? What about your mutual friends/family?

Everyone deals with grief differently. But if you feel the compulsion to tell someone about it, at ALL, then do so. Some people bottle those negative emotions up, some people need to let them out, and others try one or the other and then feel awful about it. Do whatever feels right to you, as part of your grieving process, and try to come to terms with it as fast or as slowly as feels right to you.

I'm really sorry that this happened to you, but this is real. From the way you talk about your buddy, he seemed like a wonderful person, and I'm sure he wouldn't want you to feel so torn up about it or try to reimagine it."
"Literally nothing else in her post matters. That is disgusting behaviour, does he even feel ashamed for it,

"I'm gonna dish out the same advice I gave to someone else: relationships are mostly about compromise. However, sex is the ONE THING you do not compromise. It is yes or no. If she says no, you do not keep pushing it. 

Pressuring her and pushing it is a form of coercion and turns a black and white situation into a VERY BIG gray area that you do not want to be walking into.  I understand feeling frustrated, but this isn't something you get to ask her to change her views on, she needs to come to that conclusion on her own. It's the only way she won't feel guilty about it later on. "
"But him *feeling* pressured isn't the same as her *pressuring* him. His feelings aren't her responsibility. You're demonstrating your own limited sexual attitude by acting like women are the sexual ""givers"" or something. She's not denying him sex any more than she's denying herself sex! She can make whatever decisions she likes. It's her body, her life, and him trying to make her change her beliefs just because he doesn't share them makes him an asshole. He's free to leave and find someone he's sexually compatible with. 

This isn't about the rights or wrongs of sex before marriage, it's about him respecting her autonomy, and he doesn't, at all. OP is thinking more about his sexual needs than about what's important to his partner. If she's not meeting his needs he can go elsewhere and be happier for it. She's not got him over a barrel, he's putting himself in this situation and then throwing a tantrum about it. He should leave her and find someone he's on the same page as, and leave her to do likewise.

TBH if her beliefs are solid and he keeps acting like this, chances are she'll get sick of feeling pressured into sex (which he's actively doing, not just *feeling* pressured like he is) and find someone who respects her beliefs and wants to be with the person she actually is, not someone who wants to change her into someone who suits his needs better. "
"He doesn't have to reply to you. He knows that you will still give him sex whenever he acts remotely interested in you.

Just block him on everything. He's a jerk. "

"&gt; But she can unilaterally decide that this person can come and stay?

Wrong question. The wife is not arguing in goof faith here.

a) This is not a guest. A guest comes around to dinner or a coffee, and then leaves. Hubby is not telling his wife that she needs approval or permission to have someone over for coffee.

I don't think it is unreasonable to expect veto rights even for overnight guests. But wife is suggesting they get a roommate for several weeks.

b) Hubby is not declaring himself the arbiter over who can and cannot visit the house. He has perfectly sound reasons to not want this particular person be a danger to their child.

c) From OP:
&gt; &gt;  I need to compromise with her. 

No! In a situation where one party has the right to make a decision, or veto a particular course of action, the other party just has to suck it up and has no right to demand a compromise.

If you ask me if you can borrow my car, and I don't want to give it to you, I don't have to compromise. I get to say ""no"".

I feel OP has every right to say ""no"" here."

"u/throwaway8844111 I find it hard to believe his sister didn't contribute to the demise of his first marriage. There's a good chance he changed his mind about being childfree after his sister nagged him to have kids so her kids had cousins. Even if she didn't, her constant undermining of the wife's behavior and choices (exactly like she's doing to you) could have bred resentment (that you're experiencing now) which manifested in something else. 

&gt;it is really annoying to not feel heard when I say anything about her behavior. I think he's so able to shut it out he can't understand why I don't do the same

That's really sad. Ask yourself if being muted is the sign of a healthy relationship. That speaks of a very uneven power equation between you two.  It's sad and alarming that you feel your voice is unheard when it comes to your SIL. That means that she's his priority not you. And really, he's probably doing it because she doesn't shut up and you do. Placating you is easier than telling her to back off so that's what he does. 

Shutting it out is not the same as shutting it down. And this level of interference and meddling needs to be shut down. By him. What he's tacitly saying is that he's okay with her abusing you (which is what she did when she called you a gold digger and shamed you for feeding your baby. Ask him if he also thinks you're a gold digger. Because by not shutting it down and asking you to apologize or rug sweep, he's saying he does agree with her. If you could afford it, I'd recommend therapy. Find a decent therapist, have a chat with him/her to ensure that they're on the same page as you on this issue and make an appointment. His normal meter is broken. All his life he's had to give in to her. So to him, that's normal. You were not raised to be SIL's doormat so it's grating on you. Therapy will equip him to see what's going on and give him tools to manage her. It will also help him see what's going on in your marriage because of her. 

&gt;I do feel like he values being loyal to her behavior me and our kid right now.

Ask him if he would like it if the shoe was on the other foot and you placed someone else above him in priority and loyalty. He can't just mouth the words. He needs to show you. You need to have a list of actions you think define loyalty in this context. "
"By the way she breaks and hides his shit, I'll bet you $20 she literally gave him a bedtime."
"It is unreasonable if his wife is already stretched to the limit.  If there's no slack in her life and she's exhausted, picking up more duties around the house is an unreasonable expectation.

My read of the post is that they're both running on rims, which means nobody has the oomph to do more.   And OP is downplaying his wife's commitments:

&gt;  However, I think her classes are a lot less technical and time-intensive than mine, and she is mostly going for her own professional development 
Her own professional development is (ought to be) as important in the relationship as his, not weighted based on how prestigious academically it is.

&gt; but I don't think she wants to take the time and look for places other than our favorite fast food or Chinese places.
OP has suggested a change, but he expects his wife to do the work (and it is work) to implement it.

Fundamentally, OP is saying that his commitments and stress matter, but his wife's commitments and stresses should be overcome.  It is reasonable to expect that the wife picks up around the house. It is reasonable to say ""I can't socialize until this is done"" It is not reasonable to say ""My master's trumps anything else my wife needs or wants."""

"People are saying you're overreacting, but I see where you're coming from in a way (completely removing yourself from a situation to avoid a blow up).

"Apparently I'm pretty different, because I don't banter with my friends about how 'monstrous' an attribute of their physical appearance is. Especially not when it's something caused by a medical condition, though I'm waiting to see if OP's girlfriend knows about that. 

People are insecure and sometimes they ask silly questions, yeah. But an SO of all people is supposed to either talk to them gently about it, not be derisive and mock them behind their back like a catty asshole. OP's reaction was over the top, I agree, but people are being way too dismissive of just how cruel she was. "
"I’m sorry for what you’re going through and what you’ve gone through, but after knowing this close friend for almost a decade, you really need to understand that just because you’re having trouble conceiving doesn’t mean everything is about you.

What do you mean 'supposed to be'? Either is appropriate in my eyes - certainly a gift for Mom 'from the kids' is MORE than acceptable. A gift from him because they are friends also is fine in my eyes; as I said only the V-day gift strikes me as odd. 
"&gt; I think you should be really careful about taking fantasy into reality. You would not be the first person who encourages his wife to 'go farther' and then could not handle the reality of it.

This is a great caution to bare in mind. I actually counselled a man who got into wife-sharing thinking it was his kink, but when they actually did it, he found seeing his wife show very obvious enjoyment from the whole thing cause a huge amount of resentment and anxiety about it for him. For him it turned out that the fantasy of it was the kink, not the reality. 

And as u/basswave64 said also, it would be best to gently explore this together in an actual wife-share or cuckold community where everyone participating knows what the boundaries and expectations are. Where you both have control and can go as fast or slow together as you want.

It's such an important point that I'm going to repeat it, on top of putting the other man/men involved in potentially uncomfortable situations they didn't fully consent to,  encouraging her to explore these things with essentially strangers or casual acquaintances could end up putting her in a potentially dangerous (at worst case) or uncomfortable situation she cannot back out of if she changes her mind, especially as she's so inexperienced in managing her sexual agency as an adult apart from you. Alone in another city or country without you there to support her in changing her consent, that could end badly.

As with all kinks, communication, clarity and agreed on boundaries and safety is the only way that they actually end up being fun and pleasurable for everyone involved. It also ensure that you're both growing and sharing fully in exploring the kink, and can therefore branch out to explore other such things together in future as well in confidence that you're both full partners in each others pleasure and safety.

"You might be being a bit paranoid about the dogs but better safe than sorry when dealing with these type of people.

It may feel good to be able to support yourself and your loved one, but don't be duped into doing the work of both people in a couple. If I were you, I'd have a very hard time respecting this boy as a man."
I got the impression she included that to showcase how stupid and wildly inappropriate the texting was since her husband probably knows Iwo's opinion of cheating and did it anyway.  It shows how warped his thinking was and how far removed from real life he seems to be.  I could be wrong though.
"If the instructor thought that the non-profit would be sending students her way she would jump at the chance to qualify. I can only assume that she knows that non-profit would reject her because this course isn't legitimate.

&gt;I should also add that this is the only (seriously comprehensive, 4-6ish month long) course (online or otherwise) that exists to learn how to hone this skill in this very particular job. I've looked into other avenues, but there really isn't another way to learn how to do this without shadowing someone for 3-4 years, which is how she learned.

Frankly, this whole thing sounds like a scam. I don't understand how something that takes 3-4 years of shadowing can be distilled into a 4-6 month online course, and then only cost $1000. Especially when the result is the dream job of working at home. If it were that easy, why aren't more people doing it and why would anybody shadow somebody for 4 years? Does it come with any sort of certification or result in anything real? This really sounds sketchy OP, please apply a really healthy dose of skepticism to this."
"I don't go to a lot of social events. We are both sort of hermits, but I try my best to keep in touch with friends on a monthly basis. So I understand where the coincidence that I shave and go out might stem concern, but I believe that he should have enough trust in me to believe that it was just a coincidence and nothing more.

There are many tiny red flags on various different subjects. If it is something like ""gaslighting"" or manipulation, it's one of the hardest things to address in a relationship. I do very much love him, but something is wrong here.

Counseling would be ideal, even if just for issues like this when they arise. How might I convince him to seek counsel with me?"
"Honestly it sounds like your wife doesn't respect you at all.  She makes fun of your interests until she gets what she wants, then she blows you off and just spends her time on her phone?  I wouldn't put up with that.  

Also the whole thing with her planning things then totally dropping the ball is crazy to me.  If she says she'll do something, then hold her accountable.  If she doesn't do it, it's not your fault that you didn't pick up the slack.  

&gt; I always go above and beyond for her, and she expects it

Yeah that's the line that really sold it for me as ""she doesn't respect you"".  She expects you to go above and beyond for her while she just gets to phone it in and act all upset when she doesn't get you what you want?  She expects you to back her up while she makes commitments she won't follow through with?  She expects you to spend time with her even when she just is sitting on her phone and will mock you if you suggest something else?  

I don't think divorce is necessarily an option, but you would definitely benefit from a counselor here; someone who will (hopefully) get her to see how disrespectful she's being to you.  If she won't accept that, then maybe it's time to bail."
"&gt; To be fair: this issue also goes hand in hand with anxiety and introversion. 

Wait, what?  I get the anxiety part, but what does his anxiety, insecurity, etc., have to do with introversion?"
"&gt; Yeah, funny how that works right? This scenario, to me, sounds wildly implausible. OP seems to have specifically written the synopsis to get these kind of responses. What adult would flip out wildly and call someone names (while shouting) unless we’re missing some vital pieces of information?

Because some people are insane. "
"Other redditors have covered the therapy/divorce angle for a solution, but I just really needed to point out something I haven't really seen mentioned so far : do you want your son to grow up considering that this is the normal way to talk to his partner (or anyone, really) when angry ? I can assure you that kids pick up on that sort of things very quickly, even if you think they don't hear or don't understand.

He should be making the effort to change this nasty behaviour for you of course, but also if he wants to be a good role model. If he's not willing to change, divorcing him would be in your best interest and *in your son's best interest too*."

"Knowing that you're tracked means you'll always feel followed, and it creates a reason for you to be conscious of your movement in a way that you'll try to cause the least of worries for her. You'll constantly be afraid to go to some places in that might raise doubts in her, which she proves she has because she's already asking you about it. It's her own lack of trust in you, and her own insecurity that makes her force this on you, and it's not healthy. It's like you're under a virtual house arrest all the time, and it stomps you in submission and causes fear of doing anything 'odd' because you're know you're being watched. You should explain her that 'you have nothing to hide' sounds logical but is false. A next step is to give her the access to your phone, because you have nothing to hide, and you'll have to take her insecurity into every single message you type and every page you browse. You need to be able to have some privacy to be able to be yourself. "
"Yes, this is exactly right. OP, I'm sorry, but I fear for your ability to have a healthy relationship if you can't communicate openly and honestly with your partner (this girl or any other). I don't mean for that to sound dire or hopeless, but it's something you have to work on if you want to be in a romantic relationship.

I also think that the vast majority of people understand that people in committed relationships tell each other stuff, especially if it's regarding a relationship issue. Anyone who expects you to keep a secret like this from your SO has ulterior motives 99% of the time. I think Emily's trying to manipulate you."
Yeah I'm a little disturbed by some of the comments on the original post. 
I really can't imagine why your sister in law spoke to your gf's ex and that you need to speak to him. I feel like it would be up to you and your gf and she's now meddling more than she should. I don't see how he needs to be in the conversation at all. Maybe I'm just not thinking the big picture.

She could very likely counter with, ""So why do you want to go fuck other women?"" Dude, what are you going to say to that?

I would say though that if you're experiencing this level of physical symptoms from that stress, and there aren't other big outside causes, you might want to see a therapist about managing stress in general, for your own well-being. You shouldn't be having to deal with this stress, 100%, but sometimes in life shit happens and it's good to be able to manage our emotional responses to it if they're harming us, even if having those responses is for a valid reason."

"Calling her husband a rapist, trying to fuck with his head and convince him that he raped her, and then barely backing down when he provides evidence to the contrary... something is beyond rotten here. I agree that she's trying to make him a bad guy for unknown purposes.

"Other people have already covered the CPS angle, so I'm not going to bother repeating that again.

But realistically, she is not going to listen to you, sorry. I know that you care about her, and you feel like if you just _talk_ to her, and explain what she should be doing and ask her why she doesn't, that she'll realise and change her behaviour. But unfortunately, it's highly unlikely that you're the first person to attempt it, and it's incredibly unlikely that she doesn't already _know_ she isn't a great parent. She's not going to say ""Oh shit OP, I thought I was doing pretty well but now that you mention it I'm fucking awful"", no matter how accurate it is or how much you wish she should."
"Yeah I'd say OP's normal meter is broken if she thinks this type of person and behaviour is okay.

"This has nothing to do with your attractiveness or looks, your BF is emotionally abusing you. This isn't just a ""bad communication"" thing. Go to loveisrespect dot org and take the quiz.

"You are getting a lot of comments here about how a pet should never be a surprise, and while I wholeheartedly agree, I think another huge issue to note is that he clearly didn't even do thorough research into what he was buying. Anyone who knows anything about aquariums knows you absolutely need to cycle it, ESPECIALLY salt water tanks. If he did any research whatsoever before buying this for you he would have seen what a horrible idea it was. Not to mention the extra parts he forgot, or the lack of food. Imo, he would need to be very apologetic to warrant even considering the continuation of your relationship. Good luck OP."
"Are you dating Peter Griffin from Family Guy?

Cus this level of immaturity and stupidity is usually reserved for cartoon characters.

And not for nothing...he didn’t give a shit if it lived or died.  If this was just a goofy romantic gesture gone awry...HE would have stayed and helped you sort this out so the little guy didn’t die.   You know...cus yall are supposed to be a team and part of that means dealing with emergencies and unexpected curveballs together.

But he bailed...cus his widdle feelings were hurt.  And if a frozen Octopop showed up or it died while you were trying to find a home it...you’d be on your own dealing with it.

Think about that.

He gave no care or thought to whether or not that helpless creature lived or died. 

He didn’t even give a shit that you were freaking out because of something he did.

When the going got tough...he got going.

"If you have to write a list of things he should be doing so he can ""do better"", you're still doing all the emotional labour.

Your job is not to bring up your husband to a level of responsible partner and adult.

Anyway this is what's called 'love bombing'.  Why is he suddenly trying NOW when he didn't for the previous 6 years.  Why is it that your distress previously wasn't sufficient to make him want to be better?

I would say, OP, that it's completely normal and natural for you to be exhausted, burned out and completely over trying - after all you've been doing that for the entirety of your relationship.  

What you do at this stage though is really dependant on what you want.  Do you want to give this relationship one last chance? Or do you want to go? If you want to go? Go see a divorce attorney and start getting things in order.

If you want to give it one last chance, say yes to the counselling but I'd suggest that you also go through a trial separation whilst seeing the coounsellor.  This will give you a chance to get distance - and also for your husband to actually be an equal parent and partner because he will now have to maintain the house/children/his life by himself during that period."

He's such a sweetheart and a wonderful guy that I love being with, but he’s made very clear that Crossfit is his whole entire life and passion and livelihood and joy etc., and I just don’t know if I can see or want a future revolving around this fucking sport that I've grown to detest and resent because of this situation.

Not excusing her choice to cheat on you, but you are just as much to blame for leaving her alone with the kids as much as you did. This was extremely selfish of you.

Don't let depression be an excuse for your husband's actions. I have been and know other people who have been depressed but whilst this does affect your happiness and esteem, taking this out on other people is not acceptable and your husband has had so much support and help that I even think the 'free' lifestyle he is living is enabling his actions here.

If he'd just been upset and asked you to stop or wanted to discuss boundaries to when you'd both feel comfortable with the other masturbating, that'd be different. Especially if your masterbation affected sex within your relationship. As is, he's making unreasonable demands that don't affect him about a situation that doesn't affect him.

He probably wants to make it seems like you were both in the wrong Rather than owning up to his choices. Even if you have changed, that is not the issue at hand.  He lied and is apparently too immature, stupid or both to think of speaking to you about what he has been missing.  Like an adult would and discuss his needs with his wife. Why not initiate a week away for the both of you or discuss solo trips for him and one for you or whatever. There were several other routes he could have chosen to solve this, he chose a dishonest one and is trying to blame you for it. What does that say about him?

This would never have been a fulfilling relationship. The bittersweet good news is that you found it out only four months in. And I assure you there are other men who will be able to offer the empathy you need. It may just take some more searching to find them. "

"Some work rules I now live by (having been burned in the past, too, so I appreciate how thoughtful you're trying to be):

1) Groups are generally ok. I try not to be alone anymore with someone of the opposite sex in a social situation. As long as it's not a 1-on-1 coffee chat or drinks after work, you're good.

2) Adopt the workplace standards and culture. If kissing on the cheek as a greeting is normal, then it's ok. It seems like you know the cultural norms and are bucking them to try to prove your point, but it's just making you the weird guy in the office.

3) Safe workplace topics include the weather, traffic, vacation plans, complaining about Mondays and kids. That's 5 whole things to chat about!!

Point is, there's a balance. I would go back to your boss and tell him thank you for the feedback, and you didn't mean to come across that way. You were trying to be particularly considerate of women in the workplace and will adjust accordingly.

That this concerns you greatly, because you know how serious such a breach is according to Company Policy X (recite the specific code or policy if you have it) or anything else that makes that point. And that you hope they'll take the matter seriously and look into it right away, before it becomes a larger issue.

Don't name Jessica as the source. Just wow, you know they will of course want to know this, because it is after all HR's reputation and job on the line if someone is violating company policy.

IF she's leaving soon it will surely fall on her head, AND it also puts James on the spot to do his job and stop any further leaks.

"It's not really a thing.  It's only really for grandparents who play a significant role in the child's life (e.g. they are full time caregivers) when the family unit changes (e.g. a parent dies), and it's in the best interest of the child.  So if my mom watches my daughter full time M-F while I'm at work, then I die in a car accident causing my ex husband (who previously only spent one weekend per month with my daughter) to get full custody, he can't cut my mom off from my daughter to be a spiteful ass.  Judges don't allow it to be used in the way that you're describing, however some lawyers will be happy to take grandma's money and process her request through appropriate legal channels."

One reasonable way to look at this is that he's not involved in an exclusive relationship, and it it's OK for him to date whoever he wants.

There are two broad types of posts that are often here. ""My partner treats me like a maid and doesn't clean up after themselves at all"" and ""My partner and I have different levels of cleanliness and they don't live up to my expectations"".


This is the latter. And in those posts, the cleaner person isn't always inherently right. And instead of talking about her expectations, OP just decided to redo things when he wasn't around.


In this case it's not about ""helping"" vs ""doing your fair share"". I agree that one partner should not be ""helping"" or treating it like a favor. But this involves discussion of what is fair to each person.


Not only was she insulting his cleaning skills to her friends, she was flat out saying that she doesn't communicate with him. There's no reason to believe that OP's boyfriend is a bad guy.


My husband and I are relatively messy people. Not absolutely disgusting, but we definitely should clean more. BUT, we discuss which chores are most important to each of us and how we'd ultimately like our apartment to look. Neither of us are ""helping,"" but we are working together to maintain a living standard that works for both of us. ""Water spots"" are not on the list for either of us."
time to call his bluff? do you think he would become violent if you told his wife?
No that doesn't count at all. She could visit the child every other week and it doesn't count. She has to prove she was basically assisting in raising the child which is INCREDIBLY hard to do. Parents have nearly unalienable rights when it comes to choosing whom they want their child around. This woman has no claim to custody and should be countersued for harrassment should this escalate. 
"He has shown that he's violent and unpredictable, so it's better to not confront him straight up. Violence has no place in communication, so if dude had a problem he should have come to the OP and discussed it like an adult. Not lash out like a child and let the ""anger come out of his hands"", as my toddler would say. It's not wise to piss off someone who has a history of beating up people for *any* reason. Especially if they're twice as big and strong as you. "
Wut?  He admitted he attacked her ex for no reason. She has his side of the story.
This is my suspicion. It's not that he genuinely believes you don't need silverware or a dresser or a couch. It's that he's fine saving money for his own personal purchases by making OP pay for these things out of her own pocket because he knows she'll do it no matter what. 
Yes. Every communication should be CC’d to the principal. If she’s inserting herself in your life koolaid man into her professional one. Jesus Christ I’d be livid.

"&gt;Your environment is not hostile. You're being held accountable for taking too many things for granted.

I have a friend who's exactly like OP except 26. Picks weekly fights with her parents who pay for everything. Recently her parents literally moved across the country and left her their old house (by her request because apparently their ""toxic"" presence got too much for her), and she made a page-long post on facebook complaining about how her parents still wanted to visit their property twice a year, and how that was apparently a manipulative intrusion on her private space. People actually pitied her with ""wow when will the abuse end"" type comments. No one asked her why she couldn't just...move out of her ""abuser's"" free residence and resolve all her issues at once.

It's funny how the more these parents do for their kids, the more they're labeled as ""abusive"" or ""toxic"" by their spoiled oversized children. "
"Wow, first of all the incident with your friend is really sounding more and more like sexual assault.  It looks to me like he kept feeding you drugs and alcohol until you relented, that is not ""taking advantage of"" that is rape.

As for you and your boyfriend.  If you are not comfortable in an open relationship then don't be in one. If that is a deal breaker for him, he does not care for you as much as he wants you to think he does."
"Aha, so assuming that op's sexually selfish partner isn't contributing is bad, but assuming the above poster thinks its OK to neglect your partner makes total sense?

OP’s comments indicate that the GF is also physically and emotionally abusive. Worrying about her feelings should is the least of OP’s worries as she picks her things and leaves immediately.

Surely you mentioned your dream of having a home library before you moved in/got married? Like, this has been a lifelong dream of yours, this shouldn't come as a surprise to him."
"Dude, nobody has remotely said that, and nobody has even tried to defend his initial behaviour towards you. All people are suggesting is that a little perspective is needed here.

"&gt;I want to protect myself especially given her family dynamics

I'd like you to walk me through this a bit.

When she was making more than you (that is, when she was only spending ""her"" money) you were fine with her performing what she sees as filial piety and supporting her family in whatever way it is that she does.  But that measured support is why you want a pre-nup?

Why?

Pre-nups are for divorce.  What did  you think it would do for you in terms of keeping her from spending ""your"" money on her parents?

&gt;She went on a long rant

I don't think that you get to call it a rant after you'd a)already known her perspective on pre-nups when you proposed to her and were still demanding one now (that's what we call a ""bait and switch""), b) held the marriage hostage and c) pressed her further (what do you mean by that?) when she'd already made her perspective even clearer.

&gt;I don't want her to leave

She left, dude. She's gone.  Now you start contacting custody lawyers, to see what can be done about shared custody across an ocean.

&gt;reddit how do I get through to her ?

Wow, disrespectful.  Even worse than saying she's ranting.

&gt; show her that this doesn't mean I trust her any less or love/care for her any less, not even close. 

I think you're maybe not getting that whether or not you care for her, you knew the way she felt about prenuptial agreements, you tried to force her to accept one anyway.  Whether or not you love her is not the point; you found your hill to die on, and you slaughtered your relationship on it.

The _very best thing_ you can do now, if you genuinely want to save the relationship, is crawl. Send her profuse apologies.  Tell her how badly you want to be in your child's life, how much you miss her. And ask her what she wants you to do.

And then, whatever her answer is? Do it.  And if you get no answer, you know the answer is ""fuck off."""
"Here's the thing: even if someone apologizes, you're not obligated to accept their apology, forgive them, or even respond. As the wronged party, you never owe the offender anything.

Abuse makes this even worse. Any engagement with an old abuser can be dangerous. Not worth it. Block him so he can't stalk or harass you (or dig up dirt on you) and move on."
"I think what that user means is that OP shouldn't try to force her views to change to suit him. If he doesn't agree with them, he can break up with her. But pressuring her repeatedly is annoying and insulting."

"&gt; We're not guests, we're family. 

I promise I’m not attacking here, but I genuinely don’t understand this mind set. I would hate to feel like I didn’t have any privacy in my own home because a family member could just waltz on in any time. It’s my home. Sometimes it’s dirty or I’m naked or, like OP, enjoying intimate time with my husband. I can’t imagine living in constant fear of unannounced visitors. 

But, like you said, families are all different. I may not get it, and it simply wouldn’t work for me since I highly value my privacy, but if everyone is seemingly fine with it, then whatever floats your boat!"
"Brother, you are 19. You need to separate yourself from her. Ask if one of your friends or parents can take you in. You are too young to be walked over like this and I know it will be hard on your mind but this is what you need to do. Get out of that apartment first. Next, get a divorce. Then take the time to recover yourself, self-esteem, confidence, and dignity that you will not let Yourself be put in a situation like this again. You sound like a hard-working man and someone will want you, but you don't find them until you get out of this relationship. You can overcome this brother."

You'll be the bad guy, for sure. Bite the bullet and take the hard but at least acceptable way in terms of your son."

This is just weird. OP, say no. You don't need to justify it, just say ""Thanks for the invite, sorry I can't attend."" and leave it at that.

Also also, it is beyond weird to have a coworkers MOM contact people and organize a bday party and ask for money for a gift! Thats just so weird! Do you think your coworker knows she's doing this?"
"&gt;I don't a believe in God and starting to think she's kinda selfish because I'm going to the church to be near her and she can't put on a fucking pair of paints to be with me.

Be realistic: you signed up for this. Religion is a big part of her life, you knew that, and while you were happy to make a few minor gestures like sitting in church the reality is that you are basically asking her to compromise on her religious beliefs, it really is not equivalent at all. 

This won't be the only example that comes up, either. Say you work out a way for her to ride, fine, but what happens when you start having to go to religious events, or you have a kid and debate over how it is raised, etc. There are a lot of circumstances where a gap in religious belief this large will cause tension.

Day to day it might be fine but this is a huge values clash, don't underestimate it and never presume you can trump God when it comes to a religious person."
"I stayed with my husband for 13 years after he cheated on me. I did everything to ignore what he did, move on, lived a normal married life in spite of other problems, maybe brought it up two times the whole marriage. 

Guess what? I fucking hated him for what he did. I can admit that now. I got individual therapy because he would stonewall me if I suggested he ever get help for his issues, or we go to couple's counseling. That helped me finally leave him and now I get to hate him less because I don't have to live with him anymore. 

I bet your wife hates you a little, even if she has forgiven you for the most part or tried to move on. Because guess what? You broke her. You broke her in a way that as long as she is with you will never be fully fixed. She can glue back the pieces but she will still have the cracks. 

It probably isn't the whole thing, there has to be more going on here. It didn't give her the right to spit in your face. I would seriously worry about that and she was 100% in the wrong. But if you honestly think you guys just moved past it and she is ""scarred a bit"" by your massive betrayal, I bet you anything you are wrong. "

"Thank you so much, very well put all of it, and validates my instincts.

 I do think there is no way to do this that is not hurtful, and it will, sadly, kill any friendship. I actually don't think it was as much a ""friendship"" as a long term obligatory relationship of some sort.

She did get very angry when I suggested counselling (after she cried about something her ex did 20 years ago). She said that I was insulting to her, and that as a friend I should be there for her. I told her that I had my own issues (at the time) and was too overwhelmed to help her with the very large problems in her marriage (which was ended for years by then).

I'll let the other woman know. She actually is in chemo and really couldn't be around this woman who was always complaining. Another woman actually passed away from her cancer. (The group has been going a long time.)

(and she just responded with ""Ask (my dad's name)."" I explained that I didn't want to start family drama)

If she is your sister, starting a drama is precisely what you just did, 

(and could she please provide me with any info, like how she knows him to start. She just said ""I don't."")

That was a complete answer from her point of view, she has not had the chance to have a relationship with him.

 (I kept hounding her for some answers)

Why the badgery bollocks would you do this, did you not realise that it was making her uncomfortable. 

 (and all I got out of her was that she's turning 30 this year)

That was more than enough for you to stop and do some serious thinking.  

(She wasn't very friendly or helpful and hasn't accepted my Facebook friend request) 

 Can you not see why, please think how she must feel, send her a massive bunch of flowers and a heart felt apology, and say you are open to contact should she ever find herself ever able to want to, then leave her totally alone.  

Both of your parents need to know that you have this information, hopefully your father has already informed your mother, get a sensible adult who they both respect to help you bring this information forward.

Other than spending less time with her (and maybe with any of the judgier members of your family), there's not much you can do. Your family already doesn't approve of your relationship. Getting into some gross ""who has the worst boyfriend"" contest with your sister isn't going to accomplish anything. 

Also, maybe examine your own standards as well. The age difference raises my eyebrows a little, but some of the other stuff? Who cares if your sister's boyfriend is overweight? Who cares that he was divorced? Also, he ""doesn't come from a good family""? Really? Does your conservative Jewish family live in an Edith Wharton novel? I'm not sure how much of this is what you believe and how much is you echoing your parents, but it struck a pretty sour note. "

"Like you, I’m ethnically Jewish and married a Nebraskan. Every time I’ve gone home with him everyone’s been completely welcoming. In fact, husband’s best friend from home is also marrying a Jewish girl (and he was raised avidly Christian). This has nothing to do with Nebraska or Christianity, it has to do with your husband being a total dweeb. Put your foot down. This isn’t even a religious thing, it’s about teaching your daughter her ethnicity. If you were Hispanic or Asian would he tell you you couldn’t make her traditional foods or teach her about Chinese New Year or something?"
"You're thinking about this all wrong. She didn't ""leave"" you. YOU failed HER and she decided not to be a victim of your terrible habits and decisions anymore. She learned how to care about herself when you did not. *You drove her away even when she tried over and over again to stop you from doing it*.  The fact that she still likes the person that you are after everything you did and wants to be with you now that you are no longer driving her away should tell you that she really did love you. Your horrible habits *were* the real reason she left, not because of her lack of love for you.

You want to know how you can look at a person and see past their prior actions? Why don't you ask HER?! Because she's doing it right now. 

Honestly, if you're still holding this against her, you're probably still not ready to be a good boyfriend to her. "
"I know that spitting is considered assault and definitely shouldn't have happened. Especially with kids in the house. I've been a sleep deprived and sick breastfeeding mom and I can see how a accumulation of issues may have just pushed her over the edge and she snapped. 

My first thought, like the others, was why the eff was she up all night while he slept??? I am only a mom of 1 and I swore after my first that even if I'm breastfeeding again, I will not do it all myself. I don't know how she is on her third kid and still doing the majority of the night duties. I would have lost it a long time ago. Her emotional defenses are down and her impulse control is down. Yes, she made a big mistake but from what you've said, I don't know that she was capable of handling things in her state appropriately. 

I understand where she is coming from about the games. The morning and bedtime routines are by far the most stressful time for us as parents. I would really suggest you doing your games after the kids are in bed and not when she is relying on you to help her. I would also suggest asking her when she would prefer that you do that so she feels like you're wanting to respect her needs. Lastly, I think that she needs to get some solid rest for and get well before she can even consider making a decision like that.

She needs to make what she did right and you need to do everything in your power to make things easier on her. Or, you will definitely end in divorce. I hope all works out for you both.  "

"&gt; Her driving style is dangerous, and your parents or driving instructor should make ie very very clear that this is unacceptable.

Unfortunately, if she already has her license, then there's no driving instructor in the picture any more.  And if she's 18, her parents can't really do the right thing in this situation, which would be to take away her license until she demonstrated enough maturity and responsibility to have it.

Since she got a ""brand new car"" for her 18th birthday (as OP stated), I suspect a couple of things at play here: 

1. The sort of 18-year-old who gets a brand new car for a birthday is often the sort to have something of an entitlement mentality (and the fact that OP has minimized everything the sister did bears that out; entitled kids come from families where there are no consequences).

2. Given that, the only real leverage the parents *have* in this situation, which is to take away the car (if they titled it in their name), is not something they will do, because they probably think as OP does: that this was ""just a mistake"" and she was ""just driving a little too fast"".  Of course, if they titled the car in her name, all of that's not even a potential bit of leverage."

Her partner is the person she puts first and you had no respect for that back then.

"It's really unfair for her to have put you in this position after moving in together. I think that if talking to her has not worked, you have to think whether this is someone you can see yourself being with long term as it seems to boil down to a discrepancy in compatibility - you do not want a stay at home partner and she wants to be a home maker.


&gt; Maybe she thought it was a given that I’d marry her, so then she’d financially be fine

It's such a big assumption to make and even so, the decision to become a stay at home partner requires a great deal of conversation about expectations, etc. 

&gt; So when we moved together there was an understanding  that I was covering most of the money.

Was that explicitly agreed upon? Divvying up of financial commitments and responsibilities should never be assumed, especially when moving in together.

&gt; She asked whether I wanted her to keep working on something she didn’t care about. 

What a strange thing to say, as if it is your fault that she is/was doing something she doesn't care about. Of course no loving partner would want to see the person they love doing something they did not care about but what you can do is help her find something that she will care about and is passionate about (though I don't think that really should be your responsibility considering she herself is a grown adult but in the interest of being a helpful and supportive partner maybe it's worth a shot)."

Also if I were her I wouldn’t think it was okay to need permission to have people over. A party, yes, but just a friend dropping by?

I think you should apologize to her for being harsh, explain you were just taken aback by the state of the apartment. Still, it’s not unreasonable to expect that the kitchen will be clean before you go to bed every night, or if you bomb a toilet you clean it.

He is grooming you. DO NOT BE ALONE WITH HIM AGAIN. He's counting on you being naive. You felt uncomfortable but still agreed for him to pick you up from school when he asked. He's preying on you bc he knows your young and will have a harder time saying no to when you're uncomfortable with something. That gut feeling you have that something is off will help you... pick up the book The Gift of Fear.

Nothing would have stopped you from possibly more than two weekends a month unless your mother did. Just because he’s not in the same house as you doesn’t mean he’s not your father. There are many kids who would be happy to see their dad two weekends a month. 

Just try to put yourself in his shoes for a second. He left. He remarried...okay he found someone that made him happy. And in that process he lost contact with his own kid. I’m not a father, but I can imagine that wouldn’t feel great. So he has more children. That’s his right...maybe he wanted more children to begin with but he realized your mother wasn’t the person he wanted to do it with. Nothing wrong with that."
"No, do not let him live with you. Maybe being homeless will be the wakeup call he needs to get his life together.

If you let him in, he will continue to destroy himself, but will drag you down with him.

I can’t believe more people aren’t commenting this
"We can agree to disagree. It's not about who's right or wrong... but imagine your SO's ""gift"" to you required you to solve a difficult problem RIGHT NOW or else an animal would die. He literally gave her the responsibility of keeping an animal from dying. I would probably be a bit hysterical as well if my SO put me in the same position."
"Stop messaging hoards of women with various pickup attempts. Stop seeing every woman as a potential sexual conquest. I mean YOUR HAIRDRESSER? Dude. 

The reason people keep telling you to work on yourself and focus on your hobbies and interests is because THAT IS WHAT MAKES YOU A BETTER PERSON. Don’t knock it till you try it. It’s way easier to start a relationship with someone who shares a common interest. 

Get out of this mindset while you can, you’re in incels territory here. "

"You seem to be arguing with everyone in this thread on this point. If you haven't been employed full time since you were 15, you do not have nine years of professional experience. It will benefit you to stop saying that you do, because people won't take you seriously (as shown in this thread). 

You can't get nine years of experience in six years. If you play soccer in the morning and basketball at night for five years, you don't have ten years of total sports experience. "

"You're so burnt out **I** got tired reading your post. You've been pushing yourself so damn hard. Keep trying, even if it's just one or two queries a week, for a therapist who can work with your schedule. Eventually one will pop up. 

Your work ethic and dedication are rare and admirable. Don't let that run you into the ground before you're 30! Take SOME time for yourself, even if it means hitting the gym less and reading a good book while drinking a nice glass of something tasty more."
"For what it's worth in the future: if someone who cares about you is asking if you're ok, you should get back to them in some way. Something like ""I'm ok, just need a little time to process things before I share with you"" would go a long way. "
"I’m saying from a medical standpoint, you drink more than is considered safe to drink without negative health outcomes.  Based on peer reviewed clinical research.  I’m just pointing out that a little objective introspection won’t kill you.  Your sister can be wildly out of touch, but that doesn’t make you immune to the fact that you may have a moderately risky drinking habit.  

That all of your friends have a worse pattern of drinking than you and your girlfriend doesn’t mean yours isn’t problematic.  

Honestly, I’m not judging you nor do I care.  My point is that you’re going to have a hard time acting indignant and self righteous with regard to your sister’s accusations when there is actually some merit to them.  It undermines your credibility and lends credence to her claims (which I agree are out of touch).  If you want to be convincing, I would own that part and set the record straight on the rest."

"Can confirm—my bff dated one of these no soap no deodorant no shampoo people and he developed a funk. Also the second he got a little damp he smelled like wet dog, but if you asked him he was always fresh as a daisy, because he was used to his own smell. "
"Keep in mind that you don't have to justify saying no at all.  It takes some practice - the natural impulse is to come up with excuses, because we've been conditioned to believe that ""no"" = rude.  It's not true.  Your answer does not have to include ""because I'm so busy"", ""because I'm pregnant"" etc.  All that does is open up doors for opportunistic people to come back knocking again once you *aren't* pregnant or noticeably busy anymore, and you don't need that.  


So what you can say instead is ""I won't be able to do that, no.""  Decent people will respond with ""okay, thanks anyway!"".  But if you do get pushed with a ""why not?"" response, it's okay to say ""I don't want to.""  Many people will be shocked by this response, because they are counting on making you feel guilty and most people don't have the spine to stand up for themselves.  But it's not rude, it's true, and it actually stops people in their tracks a lot of the time.  Confidence and honesty is your real way out of this situation.  "

"Thanks so much for letting me know what you think. I agree that I need to sit him down and try and talk, I am just so scared it is going to go all wrong again and he will just turn it around and make it all about himself and what is wrong with me in the relationship. 
Thank you so much for all your help :) "
"Lots of socialization and to start with getting the basic commands. I was lucky with my boy, he was fetching and sitting at 9 weeks old. My mom is disabled, and both mine and my SO's folks are getting on in years, so to reduce fall risk I taught him to go down, chin on the ground flat any time she got up. He doesn't respond to food/treats so I coaxed him into a down position with toys first. When any commotion would happen I would put him in down every time if it was my or his parents moving around the room he was in. He eventually got used to it. After my mother had broken a leg trying to walk across my front lawn without help and I reminded her we got off light because she could have broken a hip, and that scared the crap out of me.  She was coming in the house, walking with assistance the next day and the dog was out. She thought he was going to trip her and she let out a yelp, and he laid flat in the dirt and waited for her to get inside before he got up. It just takes repetition and when any major commotion happens, he knows it's his go to until everyone settles. He still screws up occasionally but I just put him in down until he calms down again. 

Edit: Did you mean the cats part? I raised him with a cat indoors and a clouder of ferals outside, one we feed so she likes us (I don't know why, but she took to us more than the others we've fed and hangs out in our yard and peeks in the windows if she's hungry). Any time he was getting fixated I told him no and snapped him out of the focus. Eventually he adjusted to the fact that kitties can do what they want, but he always has to be nice to them, even the crazy feral ones.  He tries to play with them still, but he understands kitties get grumpy and smack if he shoves his big snout in their faces or butts. We even have an indoor angry cat at my MIL's who torments him and bullies him but he just lets that kitty be mean to him. They just have to understand cats rule and dogs drool, such is the order of life."
"It wasn’t necessarily “white privilege” that bothered me, it was the way she said it in the situation. I was confiding in her about a situation I’m in and all she took out of it was “white privilege”  and it just made me feel like no matter how much she really knows my background from what I’ve opened up to her about, all she really even sees or cares about is the fact I’m white and that I “must just get shit handed to me” "

"I agree. Especially since it might be cathartic for him to have his grief validated by others, as it looks like he's ashamed of the amount of grief he is currently experiencing. He probably wants to go to a therapist, but is trying to ""man"" up and handle the loss. Which only prolongs the state of confusion. Show him the post, OP. I'm sure you won't because it doesn't look good for you, however, and that is all you seem to care about."

I'm sure that's exactly how things went down in your town. People who told you stories probably either relayed something your Dad said, confused your mom with someone else, or just wanted to comfort a kid without a mom.

"I was Nina as a kid. In my situation, OP hardly ever got in trouble because she'd been raised with these rules her whole life and it was all normal and easy. For me, it was a complete change from my mother's house. Suddenly I was supposed to understand and follow rules I didn't even know about. I was constantly in trouble for things in one house that I wasn't expected to do in the other house, and everybody in my life acted like I was the problem. Nobody saw it from my side. I was always going back and forth, adjusting to two sets of schedules, expectations, and punishments. Meanwhile my OP sister was never in trouble and could do no wrong. That dichotomy is not the foundation of a close sibling relationship.

OP didnt do anything wrong, and Nina really needs to resolve old hurts enough to stop perpetuating them with new dramas, but a sisterly relationship may be much too much to ask."
"Again, how is that a FERPA violation? Unless there's a court order in place that the ex isn't entitled to any information about his children, he's entitled to all of the information covered by FERPA.

"&gt;I just thought we had more time. I feel like my life has and what I expected for the next couple of years has been destroyed overnight.

It seems pretty clear that this is not about the car. You're stressed about all of the sacrifices that you suddenly need to make. She can sense this, and she's freaking out.

When you have a new life in your body, you don't get to slowly, gradually get used to the idea of life changing nine months later. Your wife's life has already changed irreversibly. Soon she will be sick, tired, achy, uncomfortable -- she has to take care of herself differently and put the baby first. She already has to start sacrificing.

So she needs to feel that you're on board. It's totally understandable that you haven't yet wrapped your head around all of the changes that are coming, but you really need to dig in for her sake. It's not okay for you to be incapable of driving the baby places alone -- in case of an emergency, and also because you both need to integrate the baby into your lives. If she's doing most of the work while you ""watch the baby sometimes"" and don't go anywhere... that's not going to turn out well.

You don't want to be one of those dads who clings to your former life and dumps all of the responsibility on your wife.  Right now she's afraid that is going to happen because, well, you are still clinging to your childfree life.  I'm sure you will get there eventually, but try to understand why she needs you to get there faster.  She is going to need a lot of support really soon."
What if you are watching the child alone and need to take him to the hospital? Or...go to the grocery store? Or do anything?

"It’s really good you’re set on leaving him, cheating should be a dealbreaker! If you’re looking for stability, focus on yourself first and foremost. Typically in a romantic relationship we tend to care for our partner more than we care for ourselves. I’d take this time after the breakup to map out your next few steps. Figure out where you’re going to be living firstly. If you need to it might be worth reaching out to friends or family you could stay with during this transition? I’d suggest starting a new daily routine to maintain some level of stability within your life,  going to the gym, etc. Anything that you can do consistently to feel like you have some control over your life considering that breakups are a time where you can feel utterly powerless and out of control. 

Good luck! "
"*Everyone* is boring eventually.  Even people who exude excitement and newness habitually-- that becomes tedious and a bore.

If you can be comfortable with someone, and enjoy their company, and... the relationship still allows you both (individually and together) to experience novelty and newness, goodness and happiness, etc... you're doing great.

New relationship energy is intoxicating.  Finding someone exciting 24/7 for a span is really nice.  But it's not what a successful long term relationship and a life partnership is built out of."
"&gt;he let you marry him, in other words, enter a legally binding union of trust with him, without telling you this crucial information

The way OP phrased it. I'm assuming that he told her as a confession, a week BEFORE they married.

&gt; I found out a week before we married that he cheated on me a few times with an ex girlfriend when we were dating

I don't think it makes it okay, obviously, but she had a choice to cancel and went through it anyway. She should have at least put the wedding on hold. Especially since she says ""found out"" , as maybe he didn't tell her, and she found out from snooping or friends."

"I have a feeling OP's husband's normal meter has been broken by his mother so that he can't see her outrageous boundary-stomping and privacy invading as being unacceptable. The way he laughed it off was not very confidence-inspiring.

And wife should come before mommy."

"I used to (when I had a carpeted home) do this because it is less stress on the muscles. This is going to sound weak as heck and even though I had a petite frame it just burned to walk up the steps. Doggy crawling causes no muscular pain though.

"Of course you don't have to pay for your friends! That doesn't make you selfish by any means. That said, don't be surprised if they stop visiting. "
I tell him we need something. He laughs or is condescending. I show him some cheap options. He refuses. I finally cop and go buy it. It's our apartment. He's using the furniture and supplies.

"No you are not accusing her of cheating at all. You are merely concerned that you are engaged to be married (in June), living together and she tells you she is not sure he knows about you!

"When dealing with people with addictions it really is hard to figure out the why. Just know that YOU are good enough, that the relationship the house, the life WAS good enough, everything you offered him was good enough but his addiction was stronger. Not better, Stronger. You cannot internalize or OWN his choices. You cannot allow him to mind f*ck with you about all the things he gave up for you. He couldn't give up the one thing that was breaking your relationship and for that you need to walk away before you end up with what I call ""2nd hand alcoholism"" which is basically depression and despair because the addiction has swallowed you as well. Be strong, know your worth and know that there is love out there."
Her parents can't really do anything. If they try to cut her off from him she is a legal adult and he can just tell her to move in with her. 
"Here's how I see the situation. You've known this person for only a few days (so you don't really know her) and you erred on the side of caution and told her not to send anything inappropriate to someone else. In my experience, a typical response from her side would be along the lines of ""Haha, I would never actually do it, silly."" Even if she was a bit indignant about it, ""I'm not like that, just fyi! Only a joke.""

Her response was to say she was crying, tell you you need to ""make it up to her"" and prove yourself... Really guilt-tripping you. **Does that seem like a reasonable response to you?** It doesn't to me. I think you've dodged a bullet. I honestly don't think you really screwed up, especially since tone can be so hard to read over text. How were you supposed to know she was joking? It seems like she wanted some drama out of the situation.

&gt; I think a relationship is letting someone into your life, knowing who this person is in their ups and downs, and being with them throughout all of that.

This is a really sweet perspective and I'd encourage you to hold onto that! Now, applying it to this situation here... Even if you consider this situation a ""down"" in your relationship with this girl, she's not letting you work through it with her as a team and is instead making this situation seem like all your fault and demanding that you ""work for her respect again"". Is that the reaction you'd want for other situations in your life? I wouldn't.

Personally, I would write this up as a loss and move on. This girl doesn't seem like she's very healthy for you or worth your time to try and console, especially after such a minor issue. You've done what you can and she's still demanding more. I think that if you continue, you'll be ""screwing up"" a lot (even if you're *actually* not in the grand scheme of things) and you'll be dealing with a lot of ""guilt"" for things you really shouldn't be guilty over.

Find a girl who gives you the benefit of the doubt and *wants* to be with you through the ups and downs. She's out there, and she's worth it."

THIS. Your husband is being a douche. My husband is also a boob guy but knows better. 
"What most people seem to be missing here is this. While the OP's wife was busy centering her whole life on finding a man, Mia was busy developing herself as a person. It's not some stroke of luck that she ended up finding a 'better' man. It's because Mia was very attractive, being a well rounded person, with her own life and hobbies and dreams and experiences. She's clearly someone who lives life on her terms, going back to college at a later age, not worrying about what people think. You don't think a woman like this is more attractive to a wealthy, successful man than a woman whose sole life goal is settling down and popping out kids? "
"&gt;I have a really hard time using the word rape because my friend and I were both so plastered and I did say yes when he asked to have sex with me. But it's something I never would have done when sober.

And it is not worth it.  Your BF saying ""I'm going to probably cheat on you, so get used to it""  You are worth more than that.

You deserve a guy with loyalty and self control, don't give him a free pass to cheat.  I have been with the same woman for almost 20 years, I have never cheated on her and never will. I respect her and myself too much.

Demand the guy you are with respect you."
"I have to agree. The most concerning part was:

&gt; He still won't admit he was wrong about the cart and says that they ""made him say those things"" because they made him mad and stressed him out more

Not only is he not adult enough to take responsibility, but now he's blaming others for making him angry. The whole ""you made me do this"" reminds me alot of the common things that abusers use against their victims.

If he's angry like this in front of strangers, I can only imagine how he'll act towards OP in the upcoming years."

"To be honest OP if I was you I would put my foot down to her about not supporting her marriage to him, even if it means you won't attend. One of my closest friends got married to an abusive controlling woman and 3 days before their wedding she threw a hissy fit and convinced him to uninvite half his wedding party including me and his best man. Now we don't talk and from what I hear he's miserable and she's still very destructive. We saw the red flags miles before their wedding but we figured it wasn't our business and he knew what he was doing. In hindsight I wish we sat him down and told him we didn't support their marriage because he just wasn't happy. You can let her know you'd still be there for her whenever she needs you."

Go work out, look hot, take her out for a fun night and reignite the feeling of what it was like when you were first together, when sex was fun and not an obligation. "

"Last time I checked, rubbing on some random girl's ass is sexual assault. That is a big deal and can progress into rape especially since this isn't a one off situation.

EDIT: Ubergaladababa pointed out that the correct term is sexual assault."
"She torpedoed her whole life, but it doesn't need to destroy yours. I can only imagine how bad this sucks for you. So sorry, man. That being said, you need to protect yourself. You need a lawyer. You just found out your wife isn't who you thought she was, that means you don't know what she's capable of. She could turn this all around on you, and everyone will take her side. Be smart and look out for yourself. Get her out of the house asap. "
"I personally know more girls who talk this way, and more guys that have a problem with it, maybe that's just me. But it's pretty irrelevant because 3 years in, **he** knows **she** isn't down with that. Especially because he made sure to never talk about it in front of her this whole time."
Good to your girlfriend for sticking to what she believes in. Stop bugging her because you’re horny. 
I am so sorry about your family but happy that you have the support of your husband and your therapist. I am wishing you all the best! 
"That’s so ick, that he was basically shitting all over your pre-stated boundaries *with them*. Ick."
That’s right. And yet you want us to help you figure out how to convince your girlfriend to put out without hearing her side of the story. 
"Nothing between you is safe, and a good relationship is supposed to be protective. You don't have that, and you're going to have to be guarded from here on out. Doesn't sound like a situation I'd want to be a part of."
"Fuck all these people and cut them our of your life.  Except Maria, she sounds ok. "

No. The friend said he was asking because _he_ wanted to check something. 
"Yup. I use that excuse as needed. ""Oh sorry but I have an appointment."" with my couch! "
I’m sorry none of this would be comfortable for me.  They’re completely topless?  Where were the pictures taken?  Is your husband attractive?

"i've had some success in telling people that these things were going to be thrown away but they can have them for nothing (especially if its more like ""you can have this if you can help me move it its in the way"" or ""i'm buying a new one"")

i'm sure you can get little gas heaters that are designed for the purpose and safe to use.

you could also try to frame it as you wanting to get the social off his back cos you know they're annoying him"
Move out.  You are 23 and have chosen to live with your parents.
"Jesus Christ. I would have fuckin' decked him for that, boyfriend or not."
"About a year ago, I went on a date with a guy. Really sweet, smart, handsome.  I was nervous and something in me snapped and I started babbling. I hit topics such as abortion, and why I’d make a terrible hooker. 

Well, I left the date feeling like a complete moron.

And wouldn’t you know? It didn’t deter him and we’re still together!"
"Speaking from personal experience, a man who is not only jealous of your male friends, but also holds you to a double standard (he gets to remain in contact with his exes, etc.) is displaying some orange-ish flags for controlling behavior. At best, I would suggest proceeding with extreme caution. "
"Hmm, I get the feeling you are both trying too hard to ""make it work"" because it's convenient, but not because you love each other so much or because you're so compatible."

"These aren't jokes, honey. They're mean things he's saying to you in order to warp your perception of what is and isn't okay, and of who you are. *He's being mean to you on purpose.* When I cut my long (like, halfway down my back) hair into a pixie, my husband didn't call me names. He said that he was glad I liked it, and that he did too. He's asked if I've thought about growing it out again, but not to be shitty or to criticize my short hair; he was curious and he said that long hair looked good on me too. And for my part, my husband has clothes I'm not wild about, but I don't tell him he looks like shit and needs to get rid of them. The worst you'll hear about that is a joke or two about his ""dad shorts,"" which he agrees with and participates in. It's not a personal criticism of him, is the point, and the goal isn't to make him change. That's the difference between good-natured teasing and being mean to someone."
At this point i see dealbreakers on both sides of this relationship. The way you reacted is absolutely not ok. Neither is what she did.
" Lmao right? My poor headphones. I asked her to buy me a new set for Christmas and she sighed and said ""you're lucky I'm so nice"" and she went to Wal-Mart n got me one..."
"Call a locksmith tomorrow morning. If you can get a keypad one installed all the better, then you can change it whenever you want.

Your bully has a key to your house. She screamed at you and your baby. This ends today."
