"Stop playing, you know we want pictures :P

For science of course..."
I'm too far down r/all
"Before I kissed another person, the idea of kissing was gross. Why do you want to mix saliva? What if they're sick? Have food particles in their mouth? What do you do with the spit? Swallow? Gross!!!

Then I did it. It felt good. Mixing spit happens, but you cease to care. It's intimate and sexy. It feels good. 

Before I sucked a cock, it seemed gross. What would it taste like? Precum seems gross. Do I have to swallow it or his cum? I'll just spit it out. That is where you pee. Should I make sure he washes off after peeing?

Then I did it. And it felt good to make him feel good. And it felt good to explore his shape and feel his fullness. And his precum became sexy and it didn't taste good but it tasted right and turned me on. And I felt good and satisfied when he moaned and bucked his hips. And feeling his warm cum and swallowing it knowing I did that and seeing his puppy dog thankful smile when he knows his man did that. 

Before I gave my bottom a rim job, it seemed gross. That is where you shit! It would smell. Gross!

Then I did it. And I heard him moan. And I saw it turn him into a horny man begging for me to fuck him. And I realized I associated it with anticipation of fucking and I'm at my hardest and most horny while rimming. And he goes nuts. And he cleans for me so it tastes like nothing. And now I see his sexy ass and crave it. And I know a few minutes of my tongue back there is rewarded often with my cock cumming deep in him.

The answer to why is because it's sexy. For you, for him. Just like kissing and blow jobs it's intimate and it's sexy. If you're going all the way, it is an incredible foreplay step to get everyone in the mood.  

Even if you're a top, let a man rim you once. It feels so good. A few minutes in, you might change your mind and ask for him to top you. It makes you want to bottom. 

If you're the top, it gets him so relaxed and ready for you. It makes getting you deep in him so much easier. It makes him want you in him more. 

If you're worried about taste, don't. Either it is clean or even soapy, or it's slightly musky and sweaty--both can be hot. Bottoms don't let their ass get licked if it isn't ready and clean. You're going to taste nothing or just some sweat. 

Sure, graduating from kissing to dick to ass takes a mental leap, but if you think it's gross now, know it's no more or less gross than sucking a dirty dick. If the ass is clean, it's a perfectly fine place to put a tongue. And you'll get hooked. 

Note: I wrote this last time I saw someone ask this question. 

What do I like them to do? Be still and moan. Tell me how god I’m doing. Pet my hair. And when they’re ready, I want them to beg for my cock. :) And he always does. "
"Yay, now you'll both be on Grindr"
"I just sat at a table next to a cute guy at the airport, we had a very fruitful relationship in my brain until he imaginary cheated on me in year four."
"Make you feel better?  Sure.  

Ugh!  So many....

1) Cute guy in a bar.  Closing time.  We had been making eyes.  Waited for him to pay his check.  Followed him out.  Made convo as we were leaving. Fucked him raw standing up in a parking garage stairwell.  Much regret on that one. 

2) Grindr Hook-up.  Got to his place.  Literally stepped over one of a few piles  of dog shit on the living room carpet following him to his bedroom.  His bedroom wasn't very clean either, but no dog shit, fortunately. Still fucked him.   Burned clothes afterward. 

3) Met a guy in a bar for a date.  We drink tons.  Go back to his place.  He wants to fuck.  We are fucking on his couch.  He evidently didn't prepare, plus has alcoholism issues.  Wet loose stool all over my cock and his couch.  I mean, a lot!   Fortunately, by taking the condom off, I was good after washing my hands.  His couch was fucked.  Well, it isn't his couch but his roommate's couch.  That cushion was destroyed.  No flipping that fucker over and hoping the issue would go away. Aaaaand, I worked with his roommate. Didn't hear the end of that till I quit that job. 

4) Meet a random guy on Grindr around 4 am.  Hook up.  He was good.  Wake up horny.  Take a shower.  Open Grindr.  There's another hot dude I want to play with.  Meet up with him.  That's around noon.  
Lucky me, I am off that day.  See another guy around 6:00.  We meet up. Fuck.  Power nap.  I have had a good day. Decide that I should celebrate and go drinking.  Out at a bar.  This dude I really want, and have wanted for a while, messages me. We chat.  Things are going well.  I can't believe it--he actually wants to meet up!!  Fuck!  I don't drink and drive, and I rode my bike to the bar.  Have to ride a couple miles home.  Quick shower, then get an uber to his place.  Too drunk to figure out uber.  (I know, don't judge.) He lives for fucking every away.  Costs $81 for a goddamn yellow cab. Get there.  Finally I am on his sweet cock and his ass. I rim him like it is my day job. His ass is awesome.  
I can't stay hard enough to fuck him.  I had already cum three times that day, and I was shit-faced. I wanted it so bad.  And normally I am very good. I was such a disappointment to this guy I wanted to impress with my skills.  He just wound up going to sleep. It was humiliating. 
He and I are still friends.  I just wish he knew I am actually quite good at sex. 


You just got fucked by someone you never met before.  That's not bad if you used protection. It's fun.  It is sex.  

Being a hoe isn't a bad thing. Be safe.  And try to not be filled with regret like I have been with the above examples. 

Unfortunately, I have many other examples that I didn't relate.  

"
Reading the comments made me feel like the most vanilla person ever. 
"Hooked up with a guy from grindr inside a cubicle at school. Got caught by another student who allegedly ""recorded"" the deed. Asked him to delete the video and he agreed on one condition: that i fuck him instead. "
"Finally. Like my grandma always used to say ""It ain't Christmas until somebody gets an ass full of piss."""
"Got drunk, pretty much had an open house on Grindr. 9 different guys came by and fucked me until about 4am. I didn't say no to anyone who wanted to use me and one guy asked if he could bring a couple of friends.

Was an amazing night. Stupid &amp; reckless with thankfully no long term consequences. Still my horniest memory but I wouldn't take such a risk again."
"Don't be disgusting, I was fisting it. "
"I won't bore you guys with depraved acts of lustful, carnal acts.

The one time when i felt like the biggest whore was when me and a guy on grindr went out. After sucking each other off in a public restroom we went to a park, sat down over a can of coke, pulled out our phones and opened grindr.

Then we compiled a list of all the guys in town we fucked, gossiping about each of them.

Christ, I'm a shameless whore. "
Good on you. I hope you're okay!
"This is my theory as to why others don't message me back.

:P"
I like how the gay community is there for each other most of the times.
"as a bottom, I want to thank all you guys that do eat ass.

I love that feeling of a warm wet tongue exploring my ass, preparing my ass for a good pounding. it isn't long before I'm making whimpering and moaning noises, spreading my cheeks so that you can bury your tongue deeper at the same time begging to get fucked.

so, again thank you"
"Yeah, he was most likely recording you, probably on tumblr now."
"Okay, Mr. Gullible."
You were rolling around in bed for 3 mins making noises? I think coming out is the least of his concerns. 
I think yours is a lot more weird then his 
Link?
"Troll level: 6/10

My chuckle level: 7/10

Overall: 👌"
"This is why I keep checking here every day, despite the deluge of straight-guy-crush posts and whatnot. It makes me feel so good when one of the regulars here has an awesome life event like this.

Congratulations!!!"
They're fine...i like my men hairy
"Thanks for this great update! I was a little moppy this morning, and this happy story was just what I needed to give me a boost! 

I am so happy everything went well for you!"
Your posts hurts to read. Calm down.
"Your dogs face looks annoyed. Kinda like this emoji 😑 lol
Anyway congrats!"
"Sounds like you’re bf needs to step up his foreplay game. Don’t worry he’ll get it in. Something more intimate is instead is spend an entire session having him only finger you for like 30+ min. You’ll have a blast, he’ll have a blast playing with you and you’ll be really loose to where you’ll be able to take him afterwards... have fun. ;)"
He's only mad because he got caught and needed to deflect the situation onto you. You know what your gut is telling you to do. Go with it. 
They could still have grandchildren. Plenty of gay men have children.
That bastard. You deserve better. 
K
Dis dick.
You are ABSOLUTELY correct and i agree with you 100%
Using a latex glove to eat crisps... okay.
"One night I wanted mozzarella sticks so I found a guy on okcupid and told him I'd blow him if he got me mozzarella sticks. I showed up at work the next day and was talking to the most attractive policeman I've ever seen when I awkwardly scratch my arm. To my horror I realize my entire forearm is covered in dried cum, which was then flaking off as I am trying to take his order. (Yes, I immediately washed my hands and arms.)

I don't really regret it though. I fucking love mozzarella sticks."
"They don't want you talking about your boyfriend because you're constantly trying to remind them you're gay, but don't mind mentioning their girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband. 

They think one gay kiss on TV ruins the whole show because it's pursuing a gay agenda, but don't mind seeing a straight couple fucking in said show. 

They don't mind gays...so long as they don't ""act gay"". Ugh. 
"
I've turned soil with my bare hands. 
"At the casino with my friend Whitney. SUPER hot dude messages me on Scruff. He’s 27ft away. Says, “Come to the bathroom.” I told him there is a family bathroom with a locking door. Agreed to meet there. Showed Whitney. She says, “OMFG you better go get that RIGHT NOW!” Give her my wallet. Go to the bathroom, he is waiting outside. I say hey, and knock. Nothing. Door is locked. Knock again, nothing. We decide to go out to my car in the parking garage. We kiss. Amazing. We suck. Super hot. He cums in my mouth. Before swallowing I say, “wanna make out?” He declines. I cum. While walking back in, I ask where he is from. He has southern accent and I live near Seattle. He says he’s visiting from North Carolina with his wife and in-laws. His brother-in-law just got a job at the casino so they all came to celebrate. “Oh fuck...” I think... We part ways. A few minutes later I’m with Whitney. Unbeknownst to me, his wife comes and sits right next to me. Then him on the other side. She starts chatting and making small talk. I keep thinking, “OMG lady I can still taste your husband! I’m so sorry!” We stay in touch for a bit after. He messaged me a week later, “I can’t stop thinking about you. I wish I had kissed you when you had my cum in your mouth. I keep jerking off thinking about it.”"
That's an interesting porn plot...
"When i'm focusing on the sensations going on in my ass, I tend to go soft. Especially when it gets overwhelming."
I think he may be looking to hookup with someone not close to home while he's on his trip. You're right to be suspicious.
I'm surprised how fast you got this information. What are your secrets o_0
seeking a mental health priofessional
These are fun. We should do this story time every week.
"I enjoy bottoming without getting hard. Close to climax tho it would get hard and simple strokes would cause me to cum.

Once in my life I came hands free. He was that good. I wasn't ready for it.

But yeah. You can't get hard the entire bottoming duration I think. And I guess it depends from person to person. "
"Its a common fetish, just ask your dad"
Johnny Rapid. Not a day goes by when I don’t see some feature of the gap-toothed twink. I don’t understand the fuss.
"Once.  He was gorgeous, tall, and had the body and looks of Adonis himself.  But fuck, he was dumb.  It was like trying to hold a conversation with my left shoe.  Best sex of my life though.

Also, from my dating experience, dating those *super* fit guys who live in a gym can be miserable.  ***Because jesus fucking christ, Steve, if you remind me one more time about all the empty calories from my 8th glass of wine tonight, I'm going to throw away all your frozen fucking chicken for your meal prep this week.***"
"My family is completely exhausting. 

I just want to go to bed, hug my twinky boyfriend tight and give him a slow passionate fuck as we watch the snow fall. 

But instead I'm here making silly faces for my niece. "
"Hah, this wasn't during sex, but it was hella awkward.

Back when I was ""straight"" I got drunk and slept with my gay friend. It was the second time I slept with a guy. After he bred me I went to the bathroom to clean up. When I came back out he was curled up in a ball on my couch bawling. This is when I discover he has a boyfriend and just cheated on him with me.

So. Awkward."
My boyfriend wears shorts in winter. I have completely given up on talking sense into him
So... If I'm understanding you correctly white employees do less work and you give them preference in one of the only benefits that matters in a retail job. While the Hispanic employees get the feeling of a job well done? Seems pretty unfair 
Once you've watched enough porn you can recognize porn actors readily. It's a fun power
"In porn, they cut out all the anal prep.  They make it seem like they just stick that dry dick right in, and in reality it doesn't even come close to working like that.  "
Ugly as fuck. kill yourself pls.
"Right after I came I got ""i cant beleive I have a boyfriend now"".......... He stole my favorite pair on breifs as well. I made the executive decision to not see him again. "
"Grindr hookup,  about to be pounded.. His flatmate comes into the room.. I was so horny..i said would u like to Fuck me as well.. He jx unzipped and we got to business.. Dp

**I already asked about his flatmate and if he swings that way and if any of them would mind. 

**first time meet. "
"Jesus christ man, that's terrible management and putting yourself in a bad position if they did tell the other employees or more senior management. The whole thing you mention about them being more subservient is beyond fucking creepy that you compared it to  your Dom tendencies. They're employees "
He's lying. Run away 
Vodka redbulls and cigarettes.
It you think this is a bad fetish you aren't browsing on r/all
"No, you're the first one. /s"
"I hate to say it, but when this happens -- and something like this happened to me -- the best way to deal with it is just to act as though your friend is dead and that whatever has taken over his body is not your friend.

It's an awful, disturbing feeling to have someone turn on you like that.  "
Yes
Yes; it changes the way they look. Sometimes it's all that's needed to turn a 12 year-old-looking twink into a sexy otter.
gay white people being racist? WHAT a surprise!
"I have a couple friends like that who only know how to communicate through clever quick-witted one liners. I’ve given up hope of ever having  any sort of sincere conversation with either of them, one is crippled by anxiety and the other just got out of rehab, both late 30’s. 

It’s very much a defense mechanism and extremely common among gay men when we’re adolescents to quickly get out of uncomfortable situations.  Like if you’re closeted and a straight friend asks if you think some chick is cute, you make a wisecrack and he laughs and then you guys talk about something else. You never really answered the question so never really lied to your friend and stayed comfortably in your closet.

The problem is too many gay guys get stuck in that mind-set and never emotionally mature past it because it makes them fun to be around at parties and feel like people like them. But then they go home and don’t understand why it’s so hard for them to make any sort of meaningful connections with others. 

As with most things, there’s a happy medium. Being catty can be fun sometimes in the right circumstances. But if that’s all you’ve got then it’s like talking to a 13 year old in a man’s body and kinda sad."
"&gt;I feel guilty

You didn't do anything wrong. What happened was outside your control, and it had nothing to do with you."
"&gt;So I turned nineteen today last month...I feel like my youth is wasted

Let's pretend your life is a four course meal -- you're getting bent out of shape because the appetizer wasn't perfect before you've even begun to see the main course. When you look back at a great meal it typically isn't the appetizer that's the best part, it's what comes next.

Don't ruin your appetite.
"
"&gt; the Hispanic employees get the feeling of a job well done

It gives them a sense of pride and accomplishment."
I think they are just curious because we are different. 
How do you pee with an erection??? 
"Dodged a bullet on that one.

It sucks that you lost your boyfriend, but at least you got out of the way of that inevitable train wreck.

Good for you, OP. Not everyone would have left."
Ask your dad.
"The reverse can also be true. 

Some guys shouldn't be rocking the beard. It just depends."
"Was pretty normal. He said, don't bring any jackssses home.""

He came out to me 4 years later."
My favorite flavor of popsicle is DICK!
"It's rare but still, it's hard. But there are guys out there who want monogamy.

For example me and my bf. I was searching for a partner for a while and randomly chatted him up. Turns out we were a great match. That was pure luck. We are celebrating one year tomorrow and although there has been drama with him being friends with exes, I don't regret sticking through it.

I'm sorry you get heartbroken. No one deserves that. All I can say is, try to go on, meet more guys but don't get too invested at the beginning. It will make things easier"
"For most of them, it's just their natural body type.  They aren't dieting or even really working out, it's just their default.  Obviously your post is mostly a joke, but if you aren't naturally thin, then you need to diet &amp; exercise (but mostly diet) get that body type."
I don't know if they knew I was gay but they knew I was different and picked on me because of that. 
"I like them natural so if you're naturally smooth, I'm good but if you're not, dot touch them.

Yours are very sexy. "
Wow. Just wow. 
"Sounds like he tried to manipulate you (terribly) into getting the relationship upper hand. Really bad sign that he lied about something until you gave a detail so specific he couldn't deny it. I bet he'll apologize to you profusely and promise that he won't act like this again, and then in 2 weeks it'll happen again. 

If he didn't want to get ""broken up with"" during the Christmas season, he shouldn't have been crazy during the Christmas season."
"I am a very butch guy who spent a lifetime in the military.  I have spent my whole life in three committed relationships.  All three were very feminine in their emotions and nature, and would get overtly effeminate in the sexual relations.  This was just my cup of tea.  I think these feminine emotions make them the most beautiful humans I have ever known.

What you are expressing here destroyed my first relationship.  We were together for 16 years, and he loved me desperately, but he really hated the feminine side of himself.  

My second partner oscillated between accepting himself and hating himself.  He was one of the sexiest humans I have ever known, and gave his partner iron loyalty, and humor, and affection.  But his outbursts of self loathing could make him very aggressive, and it was hard to just relax and be myself around him.  

My third partner came from a culture that totally trashes a man having any feminine at all.  Yet somehow, as he came to feel safe in our love, he just dropped the rock and accepted himself.  We have been together 20 years now, and he is the joy and comfort of my life."
He probably means that you type like an overly excited 13 year old girl. I thought it was cute.
I usually at least wait until he's messaged me back on Grindr to start brainstorming where we're getting married.
"&gt;Greek kissing 

Is that what we're calling rimjobs now? I like it. 

"
"yes to both and no to both.

Emotional attachment is something to consider when with a friend. your first time will always be remembered. Kinda  nice when it's a friend and not someone you will never see again... Unless of course it turns out to be a flop...."
Are you a doctor yet or still in school? Search for some programs in other countries and run the fuck outta there.
"What you're describing is that it's not so much that you don't like being reminded about it, as much as you'd rather other people sorted out their internal baggage such that they feel comfortable enough to not be made uncomfortable by the one gay person in the room. This guy's only making a deal of you because he hasn't really processed his feelings about your sexuality internally. It's kinda like really low level homophobia to cover up the fact he's not comfortable with you yet/doesn't understand that aspect of you."
"Combine this with lots of lube, some Greek kissing also does wonders"
"To this day... ""can you tighten up?"" still gets me. At the time I told my only gay friend about it... he just laughed and wouldn't let that shit go for months...."
"I want to see this as much as the next dude on here, but according to your profile you're a high school junior. So you should wait until you and your bf are both 18 to share."
"That last sentence you wrote speaks volumes about how you handle yourself.

And a position of authority isn't a sexual position in the context I used, it means they report to you so it immediately puts you in a position of power over them. You are the one who decides if they get written up, get vacation, etc. "
"I was in transit at Heathrow airport terminal 3. I went to the restrooms to take a much needed piss. I happened to sneak a peak at the guy next to me (as you do), and was noticed he was packing a thick-semi. I looked up and when our eyes met I knew I was going to suck it dry. We brazenly just went into one of the stalls behind the urinals even tho the place was pumping with traffic haha. I felt like a hoe, but super exciting as well somehow. "
Sorry bro...but he is out for tail. What he is telling you is total BS. Tell him its either me or that shit app. Install it on your phone too. 
"There's shitposting, and then there's this."
Had group sex in Amsterdam had 3 guys taking turns on my ass while blowing another guy while about 5 guys stood around watching the show and jerking off!! 
"He's manipulative and lying. Leave. The sooner, the better."
"I got fucked by two different guys less than 15 minutes apart, and they had no idea.

I talked to the first guy on Craigslist, and he ends up being one of those super closeted ""straight"" boys that's hesitant to even show his face. Anyway, he comes over and fucks me. His dick is a nice length (6"") but skinny. He also didn't have much experience fucking. Overall it felt good but wasn't great. He finished up pretty quick (10-15 mins) and left soon after.


I was feeling pretty teased at that point, and needed some more action. So I called up my regular FWB who was just getting home from class. He lived 2 minutes down the street from me, so I started walking to get fucked again. We smoked some weed and then he whipped out his thick 7"" cock. He was inside of me less than 15 minutes after the first guy was. It was so incredibly hot that he had no idea he was getting sloppy seconds. "
"It was when I started university for me. Growing up through school I was bullied for being gay. My whole school life was a living hell, I had no friends and dreaded every day.

I came out just after I left school. University gave me the opportunity to reinvent myself, I could be the person I wanted people to meet, not the nerdy ‘gay’ kid that nobody liked.

Life really started for me then because I became popular, I had loads of friends and people actually liked me and found me funny. Since then my personality has flourished and I’m so much more confident than I was 10 years ago.

Turning 30 in a few months time, trust me, 18 is still very young. You’ve got a long way to go so hold on to your youth ;)"
OP is wasting our time by not sharing. 
"*[reads this]* God, other people's love makes me both bitter and hopeful haha"
You can find a surrogate.
"Yes, yes they do."
You're in a position of authority over teenagers and you don't see anything creepy about flirting with your employees? 
Because big muscular hips means healthy gay babies. 
"Get out of a bad hookup, go straight on grindr and look for a rebound hookuo to salvage the night. "
"Live in the real world and not the internet or social media.

Colby Keller. He looks like he should be in a hippie commune
"When I'm bottoming I'm normally soft, and if I touch my dick at all while I'm getting fucked I risk cumming on the spot without even being hard (it's happened several times). I'd rather be soft and enjoy it all than try to get myself hard and risk orgasming too early"
"Just landed and heading home, I'm going to drink him away. Thank you for being there in this trying time."
Those people are just salty homophobes 🤷‍♀️
"Wow, you must be hot if there's people flirting with you in a store."
Got ya lol. I'll post them in a day or two. Don't wanna ask right after. Probably Wednesday.
That guy went from 0 to 100 quick. You didn't even really reject him that much. He turned a soft no into a hell no in one text 
"Your mom's a real trooper, being in labor for a year! /s"
I almost feel bad for laughing at this. 
"Im an old guy and im a romantic.

That said, i think that sex is a thing you should do *your* way.  Its personal and nobodys business.

I am known to rail against hookup culture, but i do that because i think most in it are there or at least start out in it because they are persuaded that its the only way they will get laid."
Why don't you get verbal and aggressive when you do it? Power bottoms can be very dominant :)
Why are you fucking a turkey? 
Not white enough.
"I agree completely. So many women have expressed their interest in me over the years, and while I did feel like it was a burden (because I'm socially retarded and don't know how to react in those situations), I always appreciated that she was honest with me. Seriously. I am glad she told me. It was a huge compliment after the awkward bit was over."
"It's ok dude. If you're not ready, you dont have to come out."
TIL that's a thing.  I kind of want to die now.  
Don't.
"Nope caught everyone off guard. Most thought I was lying. Those people were not my friends.

Also people called each other gay a lot in my high school. It was slightly annoying."
"LGBT teens never really have the teenage romance movies and tv shows say. Its possible but its a very slim chance, But we have the upper hand on straight folks due to the fact we don't have to worry about children at an early age. Just check out some porn legally now and relax man!"
I wear shorts year round too JUST LET US LIVEEEEEEEE
I’m glad you did. He sounds like a grade A... you get the picture. 
"I'm not sure if I'm the type of guy you're referring to. I work out and I've been told that I have a nice physique. I have generally received positive feedback on dating apps. You can check out my pics in my post history for reference before you decide to give any credence to my response.    

Now, with that out of the way, to answer your question: like everything in life, this is going to vary from person to person. It is unreasonable to assume that, just because a guy has a particular body type, he is only attracted to that body type. By that reasoning, twinks would only be attracted to twinks, bears would only be attracted to bears, and so forth. Because we know this to be untrue, I continue to be baffled why some people think that muscular or otherwise fit guys are only attracted to other muscular or otherwise fit guys.  

I will, however, make the argument that being muscular or fit is not just about having muscles. It's about lifestyle. Seeing another fit guy immediately tells me that he dedicates time to taking care of himself, at least in the physical sense. This automatically signals to me that we have something in common.  

Is that the end of the inquiry? Absolutely not. I've met extremely muscular guys who I later found out were tobacco smokers, or who were irresponsibly abusing steroids to help them achieve their look. These are dealbreakers for me, so I passed on those guys. This is why physique is just one of the multitude of criteria I consider when dating someone. And, to be sure, slim and average guys can be interested in fitness too, so I don't rule out dating guys whose bodies aren't perfectly sculpted.  

Finally, I realize your question is more about hooking up than dating, but I feel like the same general response applies: it depends on the guy. Some muscular guys may want to feel bigger and more powerful when they hook up, so they may opt for someone smaller and less fit. Some muscular guys may only be attracted to the body type they themselves possess. Some muscular guys may like chubby guys. It all depends on what they're looking for or sexually attracted to.  

I can already hear the hoards of gaybro trolls screaming,""homoyoudidnt is full of shit, muscular guys only date other muscular guys, because no muscular guy will give me the time of day on Grindr! Wah wah wah!"" To this, all I have to say is that the world is a big place, of which Grindr is only an insignificant piece."
"Well, your dad stuck his dick in your mom’s vag and that’s pretty disgusting too considering you crawled out of it."
They dont want lgbt people to be represented as commonly as straight people. 
"Okay the tumblr part was exaggeration (it does happen though), but come on why would a guy be on Grindr when he is getting his dick sucked? He was either watching porn or making some porn to beat off to later, mostly likely the latter."
What’s weird about sitting down to pee? Sitting down is really relaxing. I do it all the time. Especially when you wake up and really have to pee and just want to breath for a sec before going in the shower. 
It's inside his butt
I got hairy legs.  In my experience guys love them.  Especially tops.  Just rock them and you are good.
"Not interested in it, but not offended by being asked. "
"It's not just the (masc) white gays. Every queer has equal opportunity to be a racist/ignorant POS. Being oppressed doesn't always translate to people gaining self-awareness, usually just a higher sense of victimhood. 


Heard from a mixed black/white coworker once that ""so and so is hot, for an Asian."" When called out, he responded with ""I've heard that from other people outside of work"".... So many kids these days have little sense of appreciation for what other queers have done for them indirectly, they just want to live in their own instagram bubbles of sexual validation and colloquial edginess. 

Messaging his friend may or may not help, depends on what your goal is. Chances are, he'll sink deeper in his victimhood, ""I'm gay so of course I know what it feels to be discriminated"" mentality, while possibly rationalizing that you are too PC or something. I would talk things over with the bf and see if you can reason how you felt to those statements made by his friend, and maybe raise a few equivalent points wherein straight homophobes have used similar lines on fags in the past. 

Proceed with caution. But stand your ground. "
"I used to say that until a guy I hook up sometimes did it. I was sucking him. He told me he needed to piss, I followed him to the bathroom; I like watching him because he has a great ass.
He kinda got shy because i was looking, and jokingly said he was going to piss on top of me I I didn't let him go. I said he wouldn't dare, and was about to turn around to let him piss when he just turned to me and started pissing on my chest.
I was hot, and smelly but at the time I just got super hard, he just keep up and down my body like a hose.
Since then we always do that when we hook up. (but now I'm going to have to ask for the piss enema, sounds amazing) "

"When I lived in the country I would wake up and go out early in the morning when no one was awake except me and the sheep, whip out my rock-hard morning wood and let it rip. My dick curves upward when hard so it made for a beautiful arc and I just stood there with my hands on my hips and enjoyed the majesty of it all."
I would slap him for confusing me.
I distinctly recall dancing around the park throwing sugar and pretending it was fairy dust. Sometime it just brims over.
I did this for the first time earlier this week. When I first realized I liked guys I thought I would *never* rim a guy. Turns out I fucking love it. I had that guy sit on my face twice and I just went to town.
I'm sorry. I don't think anyone will ever find you attractive. 
"Same reason you like sucking dick. I get off getting my partner off and eating out an ass is way easier than sucking a dick. And, bonus, I'm loosening up so I can fuck him harder. It's a win-win.

Plus, it's just fun.

I don't really care what he's doing. Just laying there if I'm behind him, or he can be sucking my dick or rimming me if we're 69ing."
That catty bitchyness is a stereotype that’s embraced. 
"Piss enemas have been popular with many gays who are into them  over the decades, it's nothing new."
"Told him to take it easy, start slow, and please stop trying to rip my lips off my face.

Uh, that makes me feel the opposite of comfortable and safe. After he finished he asked why it seemed like I wasn't into it. Idk dude, maybe you could respect me?

I wouldn’t worry about it as long as you’re happy and your relationship is healthy 
I honestly think he was reaching out rather than trying to trap you.  
"I can only answer as a single guy who never had a relationship/sex so it may sound a bit naive, but it's how I feel at the moment.
Isn't romance more important than sex? Sure, I may be overestimating one and underestimating the other, but I won't know until I try both. I just think I'd feel more comfortable once the sex does come if we were doing it because we knew more about each rather than just ""Yea, this guy wants pleasure""."
"Had a Grindr hook up once and in the middle of it, he said ""I think I'm falling in love with you"" ... I had known the guy for LITERALLY 25 minutes. I was appalled. As soon as he left I blocked him on everything. "

"What's the difference between a priest and acne?
Acne waits till puberty to cum on a boys face."
"Not a sad rant at all dude, you are exactly right.  Everyone should tell their straight crush how they feel.  There's a sick paranoia that you'll somehow 'ruin a relationship', what a load of shit.  Every time I've told a straight guy I'm into him or he's cute or whatever, the worst I've got is a ""thanks"".  No shame here dude.  Have fun!"
"Unfortunately, I've been that guy... I was having a drunken tumble with an ex when for some reason I blurted out, ""You know, I really was in love with you.""  

No way to recover from that, like ever."

Me: What the hell!?

Him: You told me you were into rough play???

Before this point, I had casually mentioned I was into dominant guys, but I think he misinterpreted (just a bit). But it's one thing to work your way up to rough sex (a build up), it's a totally different thing to suddenly toss a Spirit Bomb right in my left cheek ten minutes in.  "

"In my opinion, I find that there is a difference between masculinity, and ""masc/masc4masc"" culture. 

If see 'masc4masc' on a profile - that tends to be a turn off for me. To me, it tends to send the message of: 

* masculinity to the exclusion, and devaluation of anything else
* interest in masc things, even if a faux interest - just for the sake of appearing masc 
* concerned with keeping up the appearance of being 'masc' 
* views masc/fem as some sort of exlusive-binary thing that you are one, or the other - and the two shall never cross or show traits of another. 
* think that being into the gym, sports, cars, etc is the main qualifier for being masc

While I do tend to be attracted to masculine guys - but guys that are masculine in a way that they don't need to announce it on their profiles, or defend it with long lists of what they are NOT into.

Maybe I just have a different idea/definition of what masculinity means to me than most other guys? *shrug* - but I've encountered to many guys that seem to mistake 'masc' for 'frat-boy dude-bro', and have the maturity level of a 1st year undergrad.

"Honestly, the first thing that comes to mind is what is up with gay guys and dogs? Especially small ones. Dunno why, but it's on stereotypical levels of common. I'm a cat person myself, but I definitely don't dislike dogs I just rather have a real dog if I were to get one (only exception with small dogs for me would be pugs fuckers are adorable). I think it may be representation that there's a high percent of gay guys who are extroverts, which isn't surprising, just another thing I don't have in common with most gay men."

In time you'll find more gay and other LGBT people to make friends with and eventually date. Coming out and to terms with being gay is hard for everyone and it comes with losing out and not experiencing things that heterosexual friends take for granted. Be positive and engaged in what you like and people will be drawn to your positive energy.

"I got two.

I had a hookup come over to blow me. Now I have a nice dick, it's above average size and uncut but it's no monster cock. Now based on the photos I didn't realize that this guy was going to release the Kraken. He proceeded to blow me while praising how huge my cock was when he had a 9 or 10 incher. He wouldn't let me touch it lleither, which was weird and bewildering but hot experience.

I went over to a different hookup's to get blown. He was watching *the Revenant.* I proceeded to get blown while watching Leonardo DiCapro crawl into that gutted horse. Maybe have something less weird on the TV please."

""You're dreaming,"" he said. Then I woke up."
So contrary to popular belief working out a certain section of your body does not burn the fat in that section.  Your first step is you're going to want to change your diet continued with exercise.  If you want to keep your butt the best way to do that is through squats.

"OP is a high school junior, so he and his bf are likely underaged."
"Beyond the aspect of paying back your student loans, can I suggest you divvy up your current shared expenses in a more appropriate fashion?

As far as I've read, the most comfortable and fair way of sharing expenses between people who have disparate income is to split via percentages, not amounts. So if you're making $50k and he's making $400k, you first combine, then determine percentages. Total income: $450k. Your percentage: 50/450 = 12%, his = 88%. Now all bills get split with that percentage in mind. If your rent is $1000, you pay $120, he pays $880. Now that may seem WILD but the purpose for it is to allow him to spend more on things that line up with his income without making you fork out the same amount of money. If he wants to move into a nicer place, he will have to do the heavy lifting.

You guys can go on a date to a fancy restaurant and the bill comes to $200. You pay $24, he covers the rest. That's an expensive dinner that you likely wouldn't be going to on your salary anyway.

Even with all I've said here, I think you're in a tough spot because an 8x income difference is much more significant than what the method above is typically used for, which is more like one partner making $50k and the other making $80k... However, you should be wary of your partner feeling guilty about wanting to spend more lavishly but being afraid of making you feel bad. He's earned his money and should be allowed to spend it both on things for himself and things for both of you.

"
It was just a hook up but we talked a little before hand.  Then we had sex and I went about our ways.  I got texts for days saying about how much he loved me.  I felt really bad for the guy and it was a shame he was crazy because I would have fucked him again because he was hot. I guess it could have been a lot worse.  
I like the idea of piss but I'd never do it in real life (you could call it a half fetish I suppose). Show us anyways if you're allowed of course
"For people dealing with this kind of issues it's not even porn what's mostly the real problem, but masturbation.

Jerking off gives you full control over situation, which is extremly simplified - you just move your hand. People addicted to it sometimes have a hard time finding themselves in chaotic scene full of distractions and sensations. Sex with someone else is not just about hand movement, your whole bodies work, both of you make decisions to touch so you have to share control. Our brains are complicated but ironically pretty simple. Habits can be like cages.

Some abstinence from masturbation and sexologist's help may seriously help you."

"Mine was a double whammy.
Got in a fight over something stupid with bf and at one point he ended up throwing a pillow at me, but it had one of those soundboxes in it to record a message. He said he forgot it had it afterwards. Anyway it hit me in the back of the head, hurt like hell. Admittedly I was pretty angry but when I turned around and walked towards him he ran into the corner, sort of just cowered and basically whimpered ""no, please don't hit me"".

So of course my first reaction is like damn he must have had an abusive ex or his dad beat him or something awful... Nope it was me specifically he was scared of, and I mean scared isn't even a strong enough word, it was like terror, he was visibly shaking. So I mean I was happy he wasn't abused or hit or whatever, but it was kind of an all time low feeling for me that he thought I would ever hit him, especially since I usually feel pretty protective of my boyfriends, I mean I got into a fistfight over someone pushing him and calling him a fag and he still didn't really trust me."
"I met a guy at a bar who was visiting from out of town and went on a lunch date with him the next day. The date was alright, he pretty much talked about his ex the whole time, but I got a free crab sandwich out of it and he was sweet when he wasn't telling me about the one and only man he's loved. I invited him back to my place that night to hang out--I had just gotten out of a relationship with a girl and he seemed like a safe bet for easing myself into sex with guys, especially since he was only staying the weekend.

We both cum (the sex was meh), and I'm laying next to him. He tells me he extended his flight by 10 days. I ask why, he says, ""for you. Am I crazy?"" I told him, yes, yes, you are definitely crazy. I met this guy the night before! And we just had a mediocre lunch date before he decided to do this. He left and I never talked to him again."

"if they are clean, they both taste the same.  i much prefer eating a nice ass though.  i like sucking dick, but most guys have trouble cuming from a blowjob or they take way too long(like 20 minutes or more).  So eating ass is much more fun. (plus i have a bad gag reflex)   I can spend all day eating ass and be happy, but i get bored/sore jaw and neck from sucking dick after 10 minutes."

"it's interesting because i always felt more interest in sex than anything else. but recently with a guy i met, i have such a desire to kiss, and cuddle and go places with him. to be honest i have hardly thought about sex with him at all. so i think it depends on the person, and how truly into them as a human being you are. sex is great, but sex with someone you're truly in love with has no words to describe it.

That’s a bit of a stretch. If this was the case you’d also be uncomfortable with women too. It’s more of the cognitive dissonance from the societal gender roles not so much an inferiority complex.

"I was first time both for a male and a female. The act of guiding someone and teaching how to be intimate is just magical.

There is nothing more cute than this shy, nervous virgin who tries to look sexy but it turns extremly awkward. Simple things like relaxing them with chill and funny atmosphere, being lenient or praising doing something well gave me pleasure I wasnt expecting to find. Seeing how they were slowly opening themselves, showing trust and starting to search for pleasure on their own instead of just nervous executing my instructions was hearthwarming and incredibly exciting.

I think I did a pretty good job in both cases. I also believe that bounds of trust and intimacy created this way will last forever."
"&gt; I'm sorry you lost your boyfriend :(.

I'm not.  Sounds like the BF was a real piece of work.

"My boyfriend downloaded Grindr and his reasoning was because he was curious as to if there are any gay guys around us. He said it helps him not feel alone (we live in a conservative town), but I told him it makes me uncomfortable so he deleted it"
"I just want say that you seem like just the nicest, most committed person. I know a LOT of guys would have run for the hills in a situation like this, but you've stayed the course and gone above and beyond to make sure this guy gets the help he needs.

I totally understand that you're really busy right now and don't have much time to yourself, but I'd strongly encourage you to find a therapist or counselor for yourself. Not only will this help you personally, but it will also help you better deal with your boyfriend when he returns home. Having a partner with mental illness can be really draining and stressful, and you need to take care of yourself in order to take care of him.

Thank you for the update. Again, you seem like a really great guy, and I wish you noting but the best of luck. Your boyfriend is super lucky to have you."

I thought it was *kind* of cute - but there's  ~~better~~ other breeds out there right? Not according to my boyfriend.
