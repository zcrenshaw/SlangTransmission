the woman sticks her boobs inside of his butt i think
I think the woman is the bottom in the bedroom but the man is the bottom elsewhere. 
Maybe be a buddy and make sure he is ok.  He's more than just a piece of meat you know.
"Don’t be so melodramatic. I was actually raised by a straight couple and I still grew up perfectly normal and love having a dick up my hole. 

You reactionaries get so wound up about heterosexuals having influence on kids but I’ve yet to see any evidence it’s harmful. I think straight couples can usually be almost as good role models as gays. "
"But women don't even have a g-spot in their ass like men do.

It's a perversion of nature, and they're influencing children to be straight like them. 

**ThInK oF THe ChILdREn!!!!1!1**"
"That's more than okay, that's great! If you're able to remain silent with someone, it means you both feel really comfortable with each other! Congrats!"
Be there.
"Do you know how many straight people put kids *they make* up for adoption?

Nearly 100% of all kids for adoption are from straight couples. Worse yet, it’s a similar figure for abortions. Yet the right wingers hate gays?

Makes you think..."
"Have fun in hell, devil worshipper. "
"* Passionate makeouts

* Enthusiastic blowjobs.

But he held a rainbow flag!
Imagine being with someone who wouldn't shit the fuck up. 
I don't have a problem with this sort of arrangement but I wish people were a bit less delusional about it. The path of prostitution has many dark possibilities and there are so many people who don't even realise that they've become glorified prostitutes when they get into these situations.  
We know. 
That's where I used to search for full versions of videos.
"Please, please *pleeeeeeease* keep us updated on this! AGB has been sorely devoid of any really fun drama as of late, and I can only see this heading a awful(y hilarious) direction.

Honestly though, this isn't great on his part. If he's a close family friend whom you've grew up with, it means he knew you when you were but a babe. Which is kinda weird, but also kinda hot?

The age gap is pretty important in this case as well. How old is he, and how old are you?

If you decide to continue this, your mom will be out for blood if she ever finds out. Be warned."
"Yeah, myvidster is the first place I go to if I'm looking for a particular video. I'm not sure how it became a secret gay porn haven, but I'm not complaining."
"Straight sex is just like gay sex, minus all the things that make gay sex hot and fun. "
"SPOON, Cuddle, not complain about closeness, not complain about being ""hot"", Sleep Naked, wake up with morning wood, wake up getting a blow job and smile, wake up getting poked in the butt and think it's fucking hot af, lick taint, suck cock, tickle, and just suck dick till it becomes their personal little fuck toy. ""My dick has a relationship with my boyfriend, and they don't like it if I interrupt"". "
"You advertised yourself as a ""sugar baby"" on grindr. Then you started having sex with a guy who responded to your ad. Then you took his money. That's literally every step of prostitution. This is exactly what I meant about the delusion people like you have. 

I don't know you or him so maybe you're right that he wouldn't stop giving you money if you stopped giving him sex, but I doubt it. "
I would comfort him. 
I'd seek advice from Reddit.

Sucking dick.
My straight friends tell me that they almost never have oral or anal sex. Some of them also dislike mutual masturbation. So I assume they are just masturbating from their side of the bed with some kisses maybe.
we get it ur life is better than ours sheesh
"I love getting to that point with someone when just being together is enough.  No need for any small talk or joint activities. Although I don't have a SO, I have this kind of relationship with my best friend of 20 years and I think it's the greatest feeling.  Good luck to you guys!"
ya it leveled up and now i can cast Fire 3
It's perfectly reasonable to be turned off by anything providing you're not a dick about it. 
"Gay or straight, man or woman, it's the same advice given to people who want to improve their dating chances."
"I once dated a cute twink that was smart, successful, cute, and had a nice ass - basically my version of kryptonite.  For a while dating him was sublime, and he was such a good bottom. Eventually though I started to find out strange little things that he tried to keep hidden from me... 

One of the weirder ones is that he became deeply uncomfortable whenever he wore anything with buttons. I realized that nothing he wore ever had buttons on it. If I bought him a shirt or something, there couldn't be any buttons or else he wouldn't wear it. Furthermore, he didn't like clothing that touched buttons because there would be a ""button stain"" and it would be dirty as a result. He tried keeping this a secret when dating me because I wear a lot of button down shirts, but apparently it was really hard for him.

What's even weirder is that his sister ALSO had this button fear, so when I met her I couldn't wear a typical button down shirt because she'd be expected to give me a hug and I didn't want her to be super uncomfortable.

The button thing was a precursor of craziness to come - eventually I realized he was borderline bipolar and hiding  drug use from me on top of that . He refused to get any professional help so I dumped him and brought all my button down shirts out of the closet. 

.....Thankfully my current boyfriend is comfortable with buttons. "
Not snore?
"Problem is, some people will attack people for an honest mistake. There are people out there who make it their life's purpose to antagonize people who have no ill will or malintent. These people have created a culture where straight people are afraid to even talk about homosexuality, cisgendered people are terrified of even speaking about transgender issues, and it truly limits society's progress, because if we can't even talk about something, we can never come to a mutual understanding.

"If your boyfriend is the same size as you, you've doubled your wardrobe!"
This post turned me straight
"A few weeks ago I was coming out of a gas station and passed a hot older guy going in. Without even thinking about it I stopped, looked him up and down and said ""oh, hello daddy."" Then just kept walking to my car. "

"So... your mother opened your mail from the health center and saw something about an HIV test and automatically linked it to you being gay? (While true in this situation, it's not like everyone shouldn't be tested for HIV). Anywho, it always surprises me how fast uber religious families go from loving to calling family members faggot all under the guise of religious teachings."
"I was diagnosed with Diabetes Type II in 2004.  I weighed 289 pounds at the time.  I hated checking my blood sugar and I don't like taking prescribed drugs.  So I did a lot of internet research and decided to fix things.  

I stopped drinking Cokes, on the weekend that was a six pack each day.  I stopped eating ice cream before bed at night.  I stopped eating fried foods and started eating more fruit and vegetables.  

And I started walking.  It was 2 blocks the first time and the rest of that week but it became 3, then 4 and eventually got to 5 miles a day.  I experimented with cooking figuring out I could substitute peanut butter for Crisco for my favorite banana bread.  I discovered if you cook cranberries with apples you need no sugar.  I took a class on nutrition.  

At 50 pounds lost they took me off of Metformin.  At 75 pounds lost and 2 great A1C tests in a row I got to stop testing my blood sugar.  3 years and 110 pounds later, my doctor took Diabetes off of my chart.  I'm not a braggy person but when my doctor told me that I was the first patient he ever removed Diabetes from their chart, I beamed.

"Being a skinny gay male is so strange. Sometimes you're incessantly body-shamed for not being muscular or even average (""you should eat a cheeseburger"" ""I'm afraid I'll break you"") and then some guys are so into skinny guys that they treat you like a queen and go to every length to please you sexually.

"Ha! He wouldn't dare to *shit* talk you for that!

"In Japanese it’s iku iku. The first time I heard a Japanese guy say this before he came, I didn’t know what it meant. I honestly thought I had scraped my teeth on him and took my mouth off to ask if he was ok and then he exploded on me and I just started laughing. "
"Hooked up with a guy at my place. He said he wanted to fuck me. Then when he arrived we started screwing around and instead of going for my ass he just rubbed against my crotch until he shot his load. 

Disappointing but whatever. 

Then just as he was about to leave he started demanding money from me “or else” and refused to leave. I think he was expecting me to be some weedy queen about it, but instead I basically physically threw him out the door. 

Could have been a lot worse but pretty scary at the time. "

I'd fuck him gently back to sleep
I love how my current bf moans and whines in ecstasy every time like it's his first time getting fucked. It makes the sex so much better. More bottoms could be more vocal imo.

"**What makes being on top of a guy make you more horny as opposed to fucking a girl?**

Girls don't make me horny. FULL STOP. I like to fuck a guy because I wanna get off, I like my dick being in him, I wanna breed him, I want him to squeal and be all fucking into it, I wanna make him so horny that his cock throws an orgasm without him touching it. I wanna feel his ass, gripping my cock, stimulating my cock as I shoot. I wanna smell him, feel him, fuck him, be in him, shoot in him, breed him, and have him like me, want it, and freak out because it is happening just like that. 

**Could you still fuck a girl and have the same feelings for a guy?**  
Maybe but why? Girls don't make me horny FULL STOP. I was married to two women and tried like hell to be the ""Normal Straight guy"" my parents wanted, and got nowhere but miserable. Why compare the beauty and joy of sex with a guy to that? FULL STOP. 


**When you see a guy you are attracted to, do you generally think of what his ass would look like more or what his cock would look like?** 

Yeah so like whole package. I like how he acts more than how he looks, looks are hot, cock is hot, ass is hot, but I want him to be all interested and sexy ya know? 

**Do you top because you don't like the pain that could generally come with bottoming the first time, but you would do it if you could?** 
Really??  Hell no. I have bottomed, it was awesome. I try to make all sex a wonderful, joy-filled experience with no regrets only happiness. I can take it, I can do it, have done it, would do it if it was needed to help break in a dude who was having trouble understanding or coping. Some guys get weird when they come face to face with submissive feelings after being fucked. Showing them that you can get fucked too makes it much easier to take, and also makes you more equal. I figure if I am willing to top him, then I am willing to let him top me too, equal right?  Not my normal position, most guys want me to top them. 


**Would you say all tops have to have a dominant personality to a degree, or can there be submissive tops?**

Reading too much into it. Someone has to be able to top, someone has to be able to bottom. Most could do both if they had to, but 
just naturally prefer one over the other. Sex is sex. If he isn't down, then maybe you should keep your clothes on instead of trying to talk him int it. 
 
**Sorry if these questions are retarded but I am just generally curious. Because as a bottom myself every time I look at a hot guy I think, damn I want him to fuck me. I am just curious what tops think too**

Yeah...it's fine. I think top/bottom isn't as big a deal as all that. Horny is a bigger requirement than Bottom or top. "

Looks like someone made a pretty long post trying to fight his cognitive dissonance.
It's absolutely baffling how the human mind can convince itself of anything it wants to.
"Fucked up. It's hunting season on the LGBTQ community in a Muslim country (again). Unsurprisingly, the mainstream media is ignoring it. There's been more reporting on gay marriage in Australia as opposed to gays and lesbians being imprisoned and forcibly violated through anal procedural exams in Egypt. Just because a group of fans waved a Rainbow flag. At least ""Mashrou Leila"" are speaking about it. "

No risk of accidental pregnancy.
"It's a problem of visibility. Those masculine bro gay guys you're looking for are probably right next to you in class or dorms or on the sidewalk, and you both just don't notice each other because you're both invisible.

You can help by being less invisible. Wear something subtle, like a pride wristband or a pride button on your backpack. There are ways to dress that say both ""bro"" and ""gay"", but I have a hard time describing it. Like, if you're obviously a bear it's not too hard but in general I'd be hard pressed to give good advice on that, because I know very little about clothing and fashion in general.

Otherwise, you need to find places where such guys will also go. If there's a gay sports bar around, go to it. Also try bear or leather bars, they also tend to attract some of that crowd. Look for gay sports leagues. I joined a kickball league and it was a lot of fun. There are a mix of guys, but whether they're masc or femme, you know they like sports and physical activities, and that gives you something in common to start a conversation or a friendship or a relationship from."
Not getting pregnant.
I don’t think we need that kind of language. 
"Be concerned about my orgasm.

I'm a bottom, and I don't need my dick attended to while servicing a man and his cock. But afterwards, it would be nice, if someone would give me a god-damned handy or a beej."
"Being skinny/smooth/short its always a hit or miss. Either people are obsessed with you or they are disgusted by you. Heck, even I don't like skinny. 

People message me stuff like ""stop doing meth"", ""eat a burger"", ""dude you're not a man"", ""youre a baby get off this app"", ""when I was your age, I was bigger.."" the list goes on. Even when I was young my friends always focused on how little and small I was, especially my wrists. 

There are also these really hot guys who see you and want to make you their girl, want you to dance like a girl, have an attitude, wear panties and bras. it doesn't work for me bc I'm not feminine and if I try to be feminine its too much work and it ruins the situation from thinking too hard. 

But Im thankful for the guys who are into me, who love size difference, who says things like ""I could easily break you"", ""you're very tossable"" etc etc. The sex is so hott.

"I had an actual fashion model gay roommate who tended to be surrounded by chaos, everything from overdosing in the bathroom to getting his car impounded.

Oh, yeah, and he sort of set my TV on fire. Forgot about that..."

"Dude, I don't usually feel a lot of protective vibe for him, he is a grown ass man and doesn't need a lot of help to navigate regular life right??   

BUT I was with him at the neighborhood gas station and went in to pay for gas and buy some smokes. I passed a rather rough looking dude on the way in, but didn't really pay him much mind. I glanced out the window while negotiating the transaction and totally lost my shit. 

The guy I had passed was standing out at the pumps by my husband and was holding his hands as far away from his body as possible. I assumed he was becoming confrontational with my husband, who seemed to be backing up and holding his hands out in between them. 

I abandoned my wallet, money, keys, smokes, everything, at the counter and ran outside and got in the dudes face and was like, ""HEY...YOU GOT A FUCKING PROBLEM???? CUZ I CAN GIVE YOU A REAL PROBLEM!!! ONE YOU CAN'T FUCKING HANDLE!!!!! DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT TOUCHING HIM!!!!!""

Imagine my shame when I found out they knew each other from the local alcohol and drug treatment center and were having a conversation about mutual acquaintances. 

My husband was very very sweet to me for weeks after that tho.

"Being able to like things that straight guys won’t admit they like. Examples: fashion, hgtv, romantic comedies. It’s great I can just be myself and like a variety of things without feeling weird about it. I still love macho manly things like cars, and guns and sports but I can enjoy a more feminine side too. "
It's already something you can be fired for.  Federal law doesn't protect sexual orientation.  EDIT: Trump &amp; co. just want companies and businesses to fire based on sexual orientation more.  
"People shit on “praying” all the time, but sometimes people CAN’T do anything. It’s the equivalent to sending good vibes, to let people know they’re thinking of them and wishing them good fortune. It’s not always feasible to drop everything and do something with every tragedy. So many tragedies happen every day and if we stopped to worry about every single one, we’d burn ourselves out. 

While I agree that even donating a little bit of money or food to disaster relief isn’t exactly going to out of the way, for some people it’s just difficult and hoping people come out alright is the very least they can do. 

Sometimes these people don’t know how to help or where to even start. Calling out people because they’re doing the only thing the know is NOT helping. If you want to help, provide information and resources to the ignorant.

"His comments aren't really about you, it just sounds like he likes to humiliate his partner a bit, some guys are into that.  If you really want to stay with him, tell him you don't like it and see if he stops.  But its probably better to find a guy who prefers to be more giving and caring in the bedroom like you are.  Trust me, those guys are definitely out there.  Also, don't expect much from grindr guys. If you're seeking more than guys who want to use you to get off, try a different dating app."
It's basically the same as gay sex but with even more poppers and regret
so hes on grindr chatting with you on grindr asking why you're on grindr. hm. the sex better be fantastic 
Same reason why everyone thought Tom Daley was before he came out. He just seems like he would be gay.
"Not exactly accurate. The resolution was a ban on the death penalty and one of the portions put into was punishing gays with death. As the US still had the death penalty, they were never going to vote for this.

"Made stupid conversation with a cute guy in the waiting room at a foot doctor just to talk to him but still wasn’t sure if he was gay. Later we were both in exam rooms with doors open across a bull pen area full of nurses and I decided fuck it, gave my business card to my nurse to give to his nurse to give to him and tell him I think he’s cute and to call me.

I could see all the nurses in the bull pen whispering and loving every minute of it. He never looked over my way, finished up and left. I figured well ok, must be straight. I finished up and was paying my bill at reception 20 minutes later and saw him walking by the front of the office a couple times but he was gone by the time I got into my car and left.

Got a phone call 10 minutes later from him, he said he thinks I’m cute and would totally go out with me but he has a boyfriend. He also said he thought it was really sweet how I asked the nurses to give him my number. 

I felt pretty proud of myself for nutting up and doing that even though I was nervous. That one time gave me a huge amount of confidence when asking guys out in the future."
it never occurred to you that the guys who go to those events might lead you to guys you'd like?

"It's funny, people on the right complain about liberal snowflakes all the time and yet these are the same people who throw a fucking fit about

"It blows my mind when tops don't understand what ""getting ready"" means. No, I'm not putting on a sweater. Stop freaking out (and subsequently turning me off) because I'm not at your place in five minutes. "
"No. That would be the difference between paying for a one-bedroom apartment vs. a two-bedroom apartment. In my area a second bedroom can easily increase rent by $300+ a month. 

So on top of separate beds, I would have to pay more to sleep alone? Hell no. Pass.

I also wouldn't want him paying that much himself, because that would still decrease how much goes into our savings"
I fell really hard for my roommate a few years ago. He let me have sex with him a lot but wouldn't agree to a relationship even though we acted like we were married. That fucked me up a lot when it unraveled after about a year. 
Just your heart?
"LOL Your mom is funny.


Just use lots of lube. You do realize trillions of men have had sex in the history of gay sex and still do so obviously it's doable."
"Usually you can open with ""want to be discreet, straight guy here"" (the second bit can actually be a turn on for some guys)

To avoid confusion post exactly what you're looking to do, and not do. For example ""Looking to get/give head, no kissing or anal""

How to vet:

- Make sure they have multiple pictures confirming they're the same person

- Maybe try to meet for drinks in a public place where there's security cam.

- Having their profile linked to a social media account is usually a good way to determine that they're trustworthy/not catfishing

- if you're uncomfortable with anything, just cancel or tell the person to leave or wear a condom.

- ""ICID"" text. If there is someone you trust, send the ""In Case I Die"" text to a good friend listing your location and any identifying details about the other person in case something goes wrong.

- Try to avoid sketchy areas in general. Don't do anything in an alley, or in public, or whatever.

Usually people who are friendly and not creepy will keep your encounter discreet as long as you treat them with kindness and respect. It's definitely a little nervewracking and can be risky, but just use common sense."
That would make me really sad if I couldn't cuddle with my boyfriend. 
"At 35, I officially count as “older” according to gay dating rules, but I guess that makes me wiser as well - don’t fucking make me laugh!

I think I’m a mess, but I tell you, it breaks my heart when I see some of the posts on here where guys have totally bought into myths and stereotypes and a load of superficial bullshit about being gay.

You don’t NEED to have a boyfriend. You don’t NEED to have sex with anything that moves.

But if you WANT to sleep around, fuck every arse and ride every cock, then that’s ok too (use a condom) - gay guys need to stop slut shaming other gay guys. 

You DESERVE to be loved and appreciated and found attractive and never let anyone tell you different. There is someone for you, probably lots of someones. (see above) But that still doesn’t mean you have a right to expect any given other person to want to be with you or find you attractive or love you any more than they have the right to tell you how you must feel about them.

Watch porn. Enjoy it. Don’t be ashamed of it. But remember, sex in real life will never be like that and you wouldn’t enjoy it even if it was. 

Watch movies where couples who are destined to be together have blazing fights and steamy reunions and make bold romantic gestures and live happily ever after. Enjoy them. Don’t be ashamed of enjoying them. But remember, love in real life will never be like that either!

But trust me on the sunscreen!"
"He may be bisexual and his feelings for a particular sex come in waves. Plus, he's young and this is all very new for him. He's still figuring himself out. It sucks for you, but at least he was honest with you.

Stay friends if you can. I hate saying this, because I don't want you clinging to false hope or putting your life on hold for him, but he may still change his mind. BUT DON'T SIT AROUND WAITING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN!

Take a break, [listen to a nice song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hurEFgoeKHE), and take comfort that like all things this moment will pass. "
"I know there are state health boards which do this kind tracing in certain circumstances.  It's possible that your case of gonorrhoea was tested, and found to be antibiotic resistant, or otherwise unique, which prompted them to want to trace it.  It's also possible that the non-standard antibiotic meant that your case was flagged as resisitent even if it's not.

I'd go back to the Planned Parenthood clinic, explain to them what happened, and ask for their medical advice about whether or not you should/need to seek further treatment.

Your next move? Walk away and focus on finding awesome friends. 
It's honestly shocking how many gays actually think it's a positive and would gladly support somebody doing it or do it themselves. My response to those gays is go ask a parent what they would think of their children selling themselves for sex. I bet it would not be like the responses you will get here.

"Sounds like OCD, which is a terrible mental illness to have (but responds very well to treatment). I've had OCD but have improved a lot recently. Kind of hard to understand where an obsession with buttons would come from, but I'm sure there is some kind of crazy logic train there.


A lot of people have an unfair attitude that mental illness should be an automatic dealbreaker, and if people are 'crazy' in one way they must be a pandora's box of problems. There are plenty of guys like me who've had mental illnesses but are stable and honest people. Likewise there are guys without any sort of mental illness who are just bad/dishonest characters in general. So I feel the stigma when it comes to dating is unfair on guys like me.


Him hiding drug use from you is a totally different thing so I won't comment on that."
"Ok. Here goes:

* The guy is the person who has the penetrating appendage. It could be natural like the penis-- which we all know and love. It could be synthetic like the dildos we all know and love.
* If both have appendages, either the larger one wins or the person with the non-wrecked orifice does. Sometimes it's a draw, and a trade-off can be a heated negotiation on chores or; you know, a knife fight happens, in that case the first cut wins. 
* The other guy is the person who is receiving. In almost all cases, this is the women. In rare cases, it may be the man. If this is the case, he could be a plant to learn more about our enemy in arms; or a candidate for initiation for our side. This leads to orifices.
* Men have two orifices which we all love: ass and mouth. But being heterosexual means men will not consider these for penetration. This means this number is effectively zero. Women have three technically but mostly it's rounded down to one or two at most. The hierarchy is as follows: Vagina, it's unknowable. Mouth, same as usual. Ass, the forbidden zone. 
* The next consideration is oral sex. Men have the penis and ass which can receive oral sex. They also have the mouth to perform oral sex. Women are almost the same theoretically: They have a mouth to perform oral sex. They also have the vagina and ass to receive oral sex. In reality, the mouth is used to a lesser degree in both men and women for oral sex. Men perform oral sex on women to a lesser degree versus than gay men and their partners. Women perform fellatio slightly to moderately less than their partners perform cunnilingus. In terms of robustness and completeness, very few women can approach the skill of an average gay man.
* Secretions. Men have two secretions. Semen and pre-seminal fluid. Both are known in popular vernacular as cum and pre-cum. Both are delicious. Women have a mucous-like fluid for lubrication. It is present when they are aroused. There are no secretions upon orgasm. Though some women do anecdotally report 'squirting'. Flavor does vary person to person, but if you have ever cleaned up your partner who came while receiving anal or if you have tasted your own ejaculate during anal; it is similar.
* Disposal methods of secretions. Men: Similar methods to disposal for semen to that of gay men. There have been scattered reports of some heterosexual men eating their cum. These are rarely confirmed. Women: There is no real need for disposal of the female secretions. Women also tend to follow heterosexual men's effort to dispose of semen. A plurality of women do proclaim to swallow semen. This is most likely true, but not at the level that gay men do.
* Protection. Same. Usually pulling out or condoms are used. Condoms are used primarily in heterosexual sex for pregnancy prevention. Whereas, in homosexual sex it is used as disease prevention.
* Purpose. Differing. All sexual relations are pleasurable, except in certain cases, those circumstances will not be addressed in this primer. Heterosexual sex has the added benefit of procreation, furthering our species. Homosexual sex has the added benefit of no procreation.

I hope you have enjoyed my tongue in cheek primer of heterosexual sex.  "

"Just let go more often. Tell me what you like and how much of it you like. Guide me as I explore your body. More dirty talk. More kissing. Longer foreplay. Feel free to pin me down and stuff my mouth with your dick without worrying if you look 'hot' doing it. I usually like to be more dominant, so if a guy can make me want to let go of control -  extra points right there. "

"Here are just a few reasons why straight men might dislike **current, third wave feminism**:

1. It posits that men are inherently privileged, inherently misogynistic and racist (unless they're from a disprivileged race themselves), and they'll use your sex and race to summarily invalidate whatever you say;

2. It is an echo chamber, and will discredit any person who does not conform 100% with the current dogma (see Erin Pizzey, founder of the first domestic violence shelter in the world, who is still vilified by feminism to this day). The dogma is also liable to change, drastically and at any time, and what last month was a harmless thing to say can be considered an unforgivable sin today;

3. Feminist organizations and projects mostly focus on relatively non-critical, sometimes non-important, issues of women in developed countries, and will seldom work towards helping women who face dangerous forms of oppression (this is only a partial point, I do know and worked with organizations who adopt a feminist perspective to almost exclusively help women in critical situations in undeveloped countries);

4. Feminism continuously clogs up debate in organizations that have more important issues to attend to. This is a huge problem in the United Nations organizations, specially the ones with higher civil society participation. They're frequently proposing the same unimportant issues, and will throw a fit, smear shit over organizations and leak sensitive information if their requests aren't met;

5. Feminism has worked towards undermining masculine organizations and spaces;

6. It functions almost like a cult. There're girls who completely change after discovering and getting involved with feminism, they'll start hating their family (because daddy is a patriarchalist jerk! And mommy should just divorce him), change their religious beliefs (christianism is a patriarchal institution! Islam is fine though), lead towards poor professional choices (I don't really like STEM but Buzzfeed is always saying that we need more women programmers, so I'll go for that even though it will make me miserable. I might also go for Gender Studies though);

7. Third wave feminism is built around a marxism framework, it sees the man-woman relationship as an analogous to the worker-employer relation; fundamentally exploitative and abusive. Marriage is rape, just as much as employment is theft. Straight men are inherently abusive, by the mere virtue of wanting to be with women. Current feminism is man-hating, and that is not a bug, **it is a fundamental feature of it's framework**.

8. Current feminism can easily be seen as a drastic and frankly sad fall from grace. We went from feminist women who pioneered universal vote to feminist women who shamed men who didn't want to die in the front (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_feather), and today we have privileged high society feminist women in their ivory towers who talk about oppression because people don't recognize non-disphoric transexuals' made-up pronouns. Just a few  years ago we would talk about how silly these things were, and how surely no one would take such small issues seriously, but now we're living this reality. We're abandoning much more important issues such as LGBT homelessness, how to guide a youth towards peacefully deradicalizing their families, abuse in LGBT relationships, the arguably fundamentally non-effective nature of current Sex Reassignment Therapy as a widely applicable medical protocol (essentially, it works for some people but not nearly enough to be considered a reliable medical practice, so we really have to discuss how to improve it, how to deal with the cases that are bound to give bad results [we know, for example, that family support greatly reduces suicide post-SRT, but what can we do to help the transgender people who don't have a welcoming family? Are we just going to throw them away to kill themselves?])... We're letting all of these issues slide in favor of feminism.

9. Feminism invades spaces and tries to push their agenda, and in doing so they derail the previous movement. It's what we see with LGBT issues. Feminists will say that the LGBT movement and feminism strive for the same goal but that's a lie, they recruit LGBT people for what are essentially marxism-inspired issues. Just look at any university-level group for LGBT issues; it's completely clogged with feminist agenda, so much so that it's become satyrical. Users will come to this sub and complain about how their uni LGBT groups are run about crazy people, and how it is hostile to people who don't fit their mold.

And so on.

"Sometimes? My entire life, every fibre, every penny, every breath, every thought, entails protecting my partner. I hear him now, downstairs, ironing our shirts, tinkering around in the kitchen, listening to his favourite music. He has a roof over his head, a happy home, a full stomach, a good day behind him, a nice life ahead of him, fulfilling work, money in the bank, a loving partner. Protected."

"Simple: Eating less

In detail: Cut out sugar drinks, started eating breakfast, small snacks inbetween meals, more protein, more complex carbs and less simple carbs. I ate everything I wanted to eat, just in moderation. If I wanted ice cream, I ate it - a half cup or 1 cup, not the whole pint. Oreo cookies? 2 or 3, not half the bag.  Pizza: Two slices, not 3/4 the pie. "

At least someone came.
"I've done it once with a guy and it really was one of the best experiences ever. He said he didn't have sex with guys the first time he met them, so I respected that. Still, he was down to make out tons, and it led to us laying on my bed and making out naked.. It felt like we fused. It was crazy how good it felt. We kissed for so long, I forgot we were kissing. And time moved soooooo fast. I kissed every bit of him. 

Before we got to bed, we were kissing in my yard, and fireworks went off after our first couple of kisses. I thought it was symbolic of something greater. 

Well after that, he went ghost, and I called it immediately. Once he left I hit him up just to let him know I had a great time and nada for hours. We made light conversation throughout the week...Called him out on not checking up on me after a month and he called me entitled, as if i were his ex, he said. I couldn't have the last word in, but it was bullshit..

Anyway, this turned into venting! It was a great kissing experience ruined by the fact that he was a prick. "
To reduce the stigma on the gay community. News flash! The gay community didn't want this either. 
"Weird right? 

For the most part I've never gotten straight up shamed, but I did get somewhat offended by one guy recently that kept encouraging me to go to the gym and would say things like ""I'm going to get you some protein powder""

"Other races.  I don't want to go to race fetish sites.  I just want some fucking variety in the stuff that's on mainstream sites.

"On the one hand I’d say there is absolutely nothing wrong with a comic running this storyline. Not every character has to do the absolute right thing all the time. Just because you put words into a character’s mouth or write actions for them to perform, it doesn’t mean you’re saying that’s good or right - it’s just real. It happens. So if the authors/artists want to write this storyline and explore what happens next, then fine.

In terms of real life and “outing” another person. No. Don’t do it. Maybe if they are being a total hypocrite and hurting other people - you know: the class bully beating up a kid for being “a fag” when you know for damn sure he was hooking up on Grindr the night before - and later on the “family values” politician passing a Bathroom Bill all the while hooking up with men in secret. 

But otherwise, don’t do it. Talk to them, tell them it’s ok, support them in coming out, because it’s a good and important thing to do - but it’s their story to tell, not yours. "
Isn’t his boner enough evidence he’s interested?
"Wow, I'm so fucking jealous.  When I was younger, before I could go to clubs, I always fantasized about how awesome it would be to finally get to go to gay clubs - to be able to dance with guys and flirt and meet people.  Then I realized that you don't get to *any* of that stuff if you're ugly and awkward.

What kind of stuff did you get to do?  (Actual question.)"
"Nah man, I like women and they like me too. I actually recently got hired to talk about this for a group of women in the health sector. Turns out there're lots of women who really dislike feminism and they're willing to pay me to talk about it. Maybe because feminism doesn't represent women, and oftentimes goes against their best interest. Or maybe because it really affected their daughters in bad ways, and now they want to arm themselves against it."
"I wouldnt say lazy, but unwilling to hurt him / be rude

"Everyone is saying that barebacking with strangers is a bad idea and, while that is true, it wouldn't have protected everyone in this case. He tampered with condoms for the people who insisted on using them. This guy was just despicable and would stop at nothing to infect other guys.

It's reasonable to expect some risk of getting HIV if you choose to have sex without a condom. It's not reasonable for someone to sabotage a condom to intentionally infect someone. Many of the victims probably thought they were having safe sex, but this piece of shit deliberately assaulted them."
"Empathy increase, usually. I know being gay made me a better person. Really helped open my eyes to the struggles of others. Before, I was too insensitive. Feel like I've found a good balance now. "

Dropped him a bul Kathos  wedding band and told him to wear it. He did, it was cute. He was dying left and right because it was garbage, so I started protecting him. Fun times. "

we hooked up in the parking lot of my old elementary school and everything was going alright until i went to suck his dick and he smelled so bad like a dirty cookout uncle. i wanted to gag i left and went home and stuck a bar of soap in my mouth"

Thanks! I really put in a lot of effort. We must all do our part in dismantling doctrines that disguise vile and malicious ideas by marketing them as in favor of women's rights. Fortunately lots of women see through that shit and are fighting to have their voices heard.
Depends on the reason. I don’t want to feel like just a roommate. But it is easier to sleep when he’s not there.

":))) this post makes me smile more than a picture post showing two boyfriends/husbands tbh. kudos for making that happen i thought i might have been a lost cause.

anyways i am single by choice but also single by circumstance. like you i am devoting my personal time to betterment: exercising, meditating, quitting cigarettes, quitting alcohol, traveling and getting tattoos with my disposable income, reading a shit ton of books, less distractions, sparse social media presence. 

i spent a lot of time wondering why no one wanted me back, i have been single all my life. surprisingly little effort wanting to DO the loving, no no no, i wanted to BE loved. and i realize the fallacy in that. right now i want to be the kind of guy i *would* date and ill start from there. so far at 26, compared to what i was at 22, ive become fucking amazing and whoever doesnt see that....i dont give a toss in trying to convince him to.

at the same time im not gonna be the positivity police. its not all sunshine and daisies. there are many lonely moments after 11pm where i consider if im broken, if i am inherently unlovable, or i am not wired for connection the way my peers are, or indeed im on some level of autism, and that i will be that old mute hermit who lives in a floating house and who little kids make urban legends about.

i still feel very bereft and broken, and i also feel very joyous and full. both sides of the spectrum are fine."
