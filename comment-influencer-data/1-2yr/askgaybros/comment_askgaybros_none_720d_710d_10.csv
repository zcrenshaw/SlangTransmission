This is next level ghosting even after 10 years together omg
Well....you’re also on Grindr.... At a SEXUAL HEALTH CLINIC!
"No, that’s turtley fine. "
"Damn that's cold. I'm sorry to read this, guy. "
"Here is another interesting one I've heard:

If you're around a guy and you want to figure if he could be sexually interested in guys... when you are in front of him... casually take your hand and lift up the bottom of your t-shirt (i.e. wipe your chin with it, or maybe to casually scratch your belly, etc).  Most guys that are into guys CANNOT help checking out another guys stomach/torso when ever they get a glimpse.  Keep it casual... but watch his eyes... does he do a quick glance down?  I thought that one was pretty cool!"
Uncomfortable
I feel something is missing here. part of an ongoing prior discussion maybe...
The assumption here is that you have abs
"As we were leaving: “You really should have told me beforehand that you’re autistic.”



I’m not autistic. "
"Surprise proposals are NEVER a good idea, especially in public. Did you ever discuss marriage before? "
"I can never 100% commit to any partner without monogamy. Intimacy just doesn't mean as much when they do it with everyone 

I'm sure there's 1000 reasons why I'm wrong, but it doesn't change the way I feel"
I don't think gay bars are appropriate for a tortoise because You'd be the only one who wants to take things slow.
"10 years is worth a sit down conversation. Your ex is a coward. 

I mean people are allowed to have a change of heart (It's literally brain chemistry. It happens. Sometimes it ends). Shit happens. There's no guarantee of anything in life. More over, a proposal can bring things to a head. However, he owes you the respect of telling you in person. Running away like that is extremely douche."
I’m more shocked when people tell me they haven’t. 
"Talk to the friend that hugged you and prevented you from running after. Perhaps he knows something. There is something missing that you need to learn. Try to contact your lover, phone, email, text, all of the above if that's what it takes. Don't bombard him, but do let him know that you aren't mad, but only want to talk when he is ready. "
"Came expecting a shitpost, got a shit pun instead. Not mad, in fact I'm kinda impressed..

Upvote for you, op."
"Seriously!  I don't mean to be a dick to OP, but how does the conversation ""do you ever see us getting married?"" not come up in 10 years together?"
"Eye contact. If a guy holds eye contact with you longer than usual and does it repeatedly then he’s probably interested. If you walk past each other and he turns and looks back at you too then he’s definitely interested and you need to turn around and go say hi. 

I’ve met lots of guys this way. In order for it to work, it’s important for you to be bold about making eye contact with him yourself rather than shyly looking away when you see a cute guy."
That straight guys think that someone gay automatically wants them because they’re a guy.
...or as straight as he thinks he is. 
"That gay men are pedophiles. As someone who works with children, this one personally affects me the most."
"Why you think he at sexual health clinic? It's prime hunting ground, cause the dudes there are definitely fucking. "
"The proposal itself shouldn't be a surprise, the surprise is how it's carried out. "
"There are plenty of guys who'll do what you described. Go for it. Just be upfront before about what you wanna do. I personally would never go near a ""str8"" who only wants to get off but to each his own. "
I'm just looking for the treasure trail honestly.
"Being generally agreeable and open to new things. Let me explain...

Years after we met, I was surprised to learn how much I pushed my bf to try new things that he later said he would not have done on his own. But it was because during that time he never raised a stink about it or told me about what he *didn't* like to do. He just went with the flow, and we ended up having a lot of fun. Had I been thinking about it then, it would have given me the impression that he was looking to build something *with* me, rather than looking for someone who exactly fit his personality and interests. 

We've both changed a lot since then -- it's inevitable. So I think it's pretty good ""green flag"" when you find someone who's open to change and willing to try new things. "
"People here might not understand. You'll have attractive people giving you advice about how everything is subjective or can be fixed meanwhile you don't get any matches or messages on any dating app unless they're twice your age or obese, etc.

The truth is, you're right. But no one wants to acknowledge it because it's a cynical and pessimistic world view "
"Honey, you just described one of the top 3 fantasies, if not the major one, of gay guys everywhere.
Literally download grindr and write that in the bio and you'll have so many messages your app will freeze"
"When I was ""straight"" I told myself I looked at gay porn because I was curious about a man's body. 

I constructed a palace of lies"
"Everything I've just read is pretty similar to me and my current best friend, who's straight. I thought I might have been in love with him for ages. Turns out I might not be- I just love him as a friend. I dunno. It's confusing. "
That it means anything more than what I'm attracted to.
No one is entitled to be found attractive.
Don't worry they come and shoot you when you turn 30 so you've nothing to worry about 
"2 years together, you find out he’s been cheating and he attacks you for looking at his phone? Fuck this guy. Get out of that relationship and don’t look back. "
"Also, if your boyfriend of six months is checking Grindr during your romantic getaway weekend, get up and leave. He's an asshole."
"&gt;He didn't expect anything from me, he just got me off,

Yes this is very common - I've done it plenty of times. Even I'm not sure why I enjoy it but fuck it, you like what you like."
"Haha uhh, yeah, that goes without saying. "
"
A good guy friend of mine gave me a rose out of the bouquet intended for his girlfriend on a Valentine's Day because he ""didn't want me to feel left out"" since I was single af. I laughed and thought it was a sweet gesture.


That same evening he called me to the restaurant, his gf had to leave early to catch a flight. Him and I had dinner I offered to split, he told me he'd fight me in the street if I didn't let him pay for me. I melted that day.


Us gays are the world's worst at interpreting straight guys being friendly as love.


"
"&gt;and no one would ever suspect that I'm interested in men.

Sure, Jan...


Anyway, there is a sure fire way to find out if A) another man is gay and B) if he's interested.



It's taken me years to really get this so be grateful I'm sharing it with you for free!


There are **three things** you need to know about finding other gay guys who are interested in you. Really overall you have to imagine what  straight guy would do.



**The Glance:** All guys, gay or straight, will ""check out"" anyone around them who is young enough. If a young guy or girl walks by a man WILL take a glance to see what they are working with and decide if they are attractive or not. REAL straight men will not take the glance at other men. Gay guys will probably not take the glance at women. If you see a guy you're interested in and a hot girl walks by and he takes a quick peek- Straight. If the same happens with a guy--he's into guys. Be careful, these glances can be very quick and subtle, as most are unconscious.



**Eye Contact**: Straight guys will not hold eye contact with other guys. If you do make eye contact with them, they will quickly look away or look at you weird, or just not seem to understand why you're looking at him. If a guy holds eye contact with you for more than literally like 1 second he's probably into guys.


**The Second Look:** Okay, this is the most important one. When you see the guy is looking at other dudes and you make eye contact, you look away. Now you know he's into guys and you know he notices you. Now it's time to see if he is interested in you. Look away from him. Then from the corner of your eye, see if he looks your way again. If he gives you this second look, GOOD. But don't look. Wait until he looks away. Then you look in his direction and he will probably be looking out the corner of his eye. Basically you're giving him your second look. 


The Close: From here you have several options you just have to read him. Now that he knows you're probably checking him out, if he is not interested he will probably avoid looking at you or will ignore you. If he is interested, you will go through this little dance where you both keep either making eye contact or giving each other secret glances. When you're ready (don't wait too long), you can finally make your move. Smile, say hi and take it from there. There's less pressure because at this point you've established that he's potentially gay, that he's potentially into you and that he knows you're into him, so speaking is the logical next step and he won't be so freaked out."
I was on a date recently where he started checking Scruff while I was in the bathroom but closed it once he saw me coming back. Didn't think it was that big of a deal but it was definitely a turn-off
"He never complained because he is providing for you. 



Some people are like this. They want to be able to see the people around them happy and if it means they work 8:00-4:30 everyday then so be it. 



If anything, find something you are good at. Be it art, writing (you can use voice software), music, walking dogs, etc. There are plenty of jobs out there that could keep you busy and out of the house. My foster-sister is severely impacted by brain damage and she walks dogs. She gets income from the government disability and walks dogs to buy the things she wants. 


Sounds like someone loves you dude. Don't look at it in any other way. "
"Tell him you don't do pictures, but if he wants to see it so bad, meet you in the bathroom. "
"I have some intel from the straight sapiens and from what I'm told, ghosting is as bad or even worse on straight tinder."
Flip a kayak... new sexual term?
That's how you break your dick.
"That I looked younger in my profile pic. I was 21, he was almost 50."
ssshhh! you’ll scare him away
"Old, rich and dying"
"One day I'll have a cute monogamous husband with 2 kids in a nice house with a white picket fence, situated within a strong school district. 

A dom can dream. "
I enjoy the closeness and trust that you get in a monogamous relationship. Everybody is free to have their own opinions and preferences though.
Give this guy an English award!
"Also, fuck them for saying that ""age"" is a form of discrimination.

No it fucking isn't, I'm not getting into this topic any longer."
It's never too late to start being who you are. 
"Stalked your history. 


You are very handsome dude. 


Those guys really fucked up big time. "

Fine... "
"I'm really introverted, so they kind of all boil down to ""being with him is just like being alone, only better!""  In particular, sometimes you just sleep really well next to someone, and that's always a good sign."
"We fall in love with a person not only for their physical attractiveness but also other qualities that attract us as well, be it their sense of humor, Intelligence, similar goals, etc.  It doesn’t mean we are dead and can’t find other people attractive.  My bf and I look at other guys and tell each other we think the guy we saw is attractive.  We are secure enough in our relationship to know that our bond is stronger than just physical attraction.  There is so much more to a relationship than just looks. "
"My boyfriend and I both wear glasses but we're nearsighted so we take them off before sex. When we are cuddling and one of us take off their glasses, then we know it's on."
"Once I was waiting at a train station and a guy asked me for directions. Then he started chatting, asking me if I go to school nearby and that he just got a job at a new startup, blah blah. Then we get on the train and keep chatting. At one point we talk about where we live and he said, ""I've never been in that area. I'd love to tell you more about my job. Maybe we could go to a brewery or something."" I was like, Yeah! But I thought he would ask me for my number. I think I just never really made a move. Later I sort of stalked him and got in touch. We talked for a little bit but then when I made a move he never replied back. 😥"
"Sort of. I've got a friend that I used to walk to school with every day but never really became good friends with until I was in yr 13 (last year of school in the UK). 

He was one of those guys in school that's good looking, do sports, are genuinely nice and decently intelligent so I always felt like he was way too cool for me to be friends with him (I know that's stupid but that's how the mind works in school). 

After the first year of uni over summer I came out as gay and he then told me he's bi over the Christmas holidays. Ever since whenever we go on nights out together or get high we always end up walking back home together like we always did when we were younger. 

He's increasingly gotten more open about being bi and on our last night together before we both went back to uni (so 3 weeks ago) he straight up told me that if he wasn't with his girlfriend he'd be with me over any guy he's ever met. 

So, I wouldn't necessarily say he's in love with me but I think me coming out really surprised him and made him look at himself and whether he's completely straight."
Gay bars are for everyone. Just don't be a dick if some guy tries to buy you a drink. 
Well fuck me. I'm usually way too nervous to maintain eye contact...
To b honest a deep friendship has many of the same qualities and feelings of a relationship except sex and greater financial commitment in a relationship. It is easy to get the feelings mixed-up.

"The cutest thing was when my straight best friend said ""kiss me"" when we were drunk. And I didn't, but then he kissed me and now it's been 7 months since I started dating my best friend "
My bf and I do it all the time. Personally I think it's quite healthy. Because we are in a relationship we have not become blind to the physical attractiveness of those around us. If we were not able to discuss it I would feel like there was a level of dishonesty in our relationship.
"Well, he did fuck the guy...so chances are the other guy got off too.  OP isn't as selfish as he thinks he is."
"After nearly two years I can honestly say I have a crush on my SO. If he sends me a snap I get butterflies. Do I think about other guys while JO? Sometimes... But it's always just a sexual fantasy. My SO is hot, adorable, incredibly intelligent and very kind. I'm in love with him. No one else has that from me. "
"Yes you are just his ego boost. 

He likes you, but doesn't love you. He will never love you, he will always choose his girlfriend over you. Time to move on bro. "
"*click click click click*

Listen… is that—is that two nerds making out?"
You really should have told him  beforehand that you’re autistic.
"That a week after you've had a conversation about something in your life, he's able to refer to details from your conversation.  Shows that not only was he listening at the time, but he's emotionally invested enough in your life and well being to keep thinking about the things you've said, long after the original conversation is over."
"I feel like there's a lot to the story that is missing. No shade.

A rare glimpse into the giraffe life. I never thought about how that must happen.
"I get to thinking we've come a long way as a people, and then I see stuff like this."

"I was crushing on a tall, scruffy, long curly blonde haired, outdoorsy, smart man from work - just my type. I would always glance his way during meetings to just catch a glimpse. During a wine and cheese social, my equally tall self was staring at him above the other heads across the room. And then I realized he was staring back. 😅 He came over a minute later to socialize with my circle and I... I didn't say a word. Sooooo stupid. Still kicking myself."
And they're being safe. Getting tested/treated. More than you know about some other rando.
"I’ve been that guy before. It’s an independence issue for him. He doesn’t want to feel like he’s relying on you. You having a stable job and the means to support yourself more comfortably makes him feel inferior. Some people value their ability to take care of themselves more than being taken care of. What seems like a couple hundred dollar here and there to you is a much larger psychological block for him than the actual money.

Let him contribute in a way that makes him feel like he’s doing what he needs to do even if it’s making thing difficult right now.  "
How do you know the other guy is horrible just from this story? We need a lot more backstory to make that kind of call. 
I'm attracted to men.
yikes this thread is toxic...
"I would suggest inviting him to go swimming. While you are changing *accidentally* fall near him and have your mouth land right in front of his crotch. Nature should take over at that point.

"As much as it seems that some people would desire a sub like this, I don't think it is really achievable in practice. You would have to make rules and have someone decide who/what is masc and whats not. That right there is just asking for a shitshow."
"Man, good on you for trying - I can't imagine this is a pleasant situation to be in but you clearly have a conscience! I'm shocked the police were so cavalier about it - hopefully the guy was using a fake photo but for all the cops know that really could have been his son... you'd think CPS would be informed somehow. Maybe contact them?"
"You did nothing, he's just a horrible human being.

So, now you start the road to recovering from heartbreak (which doesn't involve contacting our trying to reach out to your shitty ex, none of that)"
"He is distraught that he got caught, I'm sure. He clearly wasn't clutching his pearls racked with guilt beforehand.

He's not faithful to you. He doesn't respect you enough to respect your time and sense of trust.

Dump him. Block him. Unfriend him. And when he rails back begging for forgiveness, remember that every single time he could have been with you, he chose to think about someone else. Every time he could have texted you, he chose to text someone else.

Dump his ass and find someone who is willing to not walk all over you."
"The use of ""gay"" to mean lacking in athletic ability. My favorite instance of this was a friend who said another friend was ""running gay"" (he was running in a manner that would stereotypically fall into a ""feminine manner"") to which I replied, ""I am gay, I ran state level track and cross country. Do you think I run like that?"" He turned very red, to my satisfaction, and tried to argue his point for a second until realizing he was being an asshole.  "
"Handsome: Fuckable and has class.

Hot: Fuckable but not necessarily has class.

Cute: Fuckable. Implies harmlessness whether he has class or not."
"This was a wakeup call for me:

When I was younger, I thought that gay men were so oppressed that they wouldn't ever consider hurting each other in a romantic relationship. I always imagined if I were in love with someone, we'd be each other's saviors, because we are so rare.

That is really not the case. There is so much hatred and vanity within the gay community, it's a bit disgusting.. and gay people are just as available as straight people are in some areas. "

"They're balding. Also, if you have the hat turned right side around the front gets in the way when making out and sucking dick. "
"Right in front of her salad, cool."
"2-3 times a week, after almost 10 years together. I think every day is a bit much to ask. Sex is supposed to be fun, not routine."
"Younger guys who are relationship-oriented and refuse to hookup are going to have a very difficult time finding a partner.

Most gay guys don't get to experience sex, or even their first kiss, until they're in college or beyond. Heck, most guys aren't even out of the closet until then either. So they download Grindr and try to ""catch up"" on all the experiences that their straight peers had in high school.

And gay marriage is only legal in some countries, and it's been a very recent change. The gay population as a whole has still not adapted to the idea of two men getting married, staying monogamous, and starting a family. There are many guys who would balk at the idea of settling down at all, let alone in their 20s while they're at their peak."

Which I'm not even sure what he was talking about but I thought it was rude. I made a comment that was basically a compliment.

The next morning, we smoked a bit and I said something (not sure what...I think we were watching a TV show or something and I pointed something out or thought something was really funny) and he goes ""God you're so annoying"".

When I came out to my friends, they expected the entirety of my personality to change. Worst flack I got was from my gay friends. One was happy I came out because he thought we'd be going to gay bars together b/c he was sick of going with straight girls. While I understand where he's coming from, I don't like gay bars that much [too high energy, loud music, none of them are chill and social like the bars I like going to], and he KNEW I was more introverted and have never been big on crowded places and parties. Another friend wanted me to go to a salon with him to get pedicures [I have never wanted to go to a spa or to do anything with my nails etc.]. Also he wanted to talk about RuPaul's Drag Race, but I have never watched that show and don't really give a shit about drag queens, so my friend said ""you need to be a real gay"". Gatekeeping. Gaytkeeping.

So yeah I guess my biggest annoyance is the idea that you can't ""really"" be gay unless your entire personhood follows all of the stereotypes. Here I thought dick sucking was enough. "

"As a sub, I dream of a dom like you. "
"Well he didn't kiss so he's still straight right?  Right?  Right?

No you're not straight you fucked a guy.  You may be a selfish top but straight, you ain't."
"You obviously want to post one, so just go ahead and do it.

I don't know, asking people to ask for your dick pic just seems really... lame. "
"It's really a big deal for him.  I know it might not seem that way to many straight people anymore (jeez what's the big deal, you're gay, so what?).  But for men who are insecure it touches on everything to their very core of who they are: societal and self-expectations (get a wife, have kids), sex, masculine self-image, internalized stereotypes, rational and irrational fears and beliefs about what other people will think.  Don't downplay it.  Have a heart-to-heart and tell him you're proud of how brave he is.  

But at the same time, don't fixate on it either once you've done that.  Don't expect him to change from the dudebro type -- that may well be his genuine personality.  I've been out most of my life and I'm the same way.  On the other hand maybe it is a facade put up to protect himself and he'll change.  No way to know, really.

Suggestions?  Take him to a gay sports bar."
"Okcupid is not terrible but if you're looking for a long term relationship I'd give dating apps a miss and try signing up for some LGBT activities that you're interested in. I met my husband online in a group for gays who were interested in traveling and finding travel companions. Six months later we went on holiday together, as friends, built memories for a lifetime. "
"Maybe enjoy it for what it is and stop worrying that he’s out of your league. Have some fun with him, if it goes somewhere, yay, if it doesn’t you’ve got to spend more time with this guy you think is awesome.

Plus, pics?"
"I'm a bit perplexed by your situation, apart from your man troubles:

First: You say you are having trouble being adherent to your treatment. **Why?** Is it substance-abuse related?

I hate to put it this way, but how can you expect to have a suppressed viral load if you can't stay adherent? Protect his health by protecting *your* health: stay adherent!

Second: Does your doctor know your trouble with adherence?

Third: If you get adherent, the resistance to the entry-level Truvada becomes less of an issue as your viral load becomes suppressed.

Without an ounce of judgement but with a pound of concern: It sounds like you need to handle some personal issues re: your adherence and mental well-being before you can get into a relationship with *anybody*. Taking care of yourself should be the primary goal... And I'm not sure you pass that benchmark right now.

Have you considered talking to a therapist re: your wavering self-care? If it's substance-abuse related, have you spoken to your doctor about detox or other intervention methods?"
"Fine, I'm a proud age discriminator. I'm 29 and don't want to date anyone more than ten years older me. 

Jesus, how fucking horrible of a person I am. "
"My boyfriend likes to act like a big tough jock around his friends, but little do they know that in private he answers and responds to the name of Mister Snugglebunny. 

"
"I get this line of thinking. But it's a two-pronged problem. Am I in a good emotional space right now? Definitely not. That leads me to isolate and want to connect. And then the rejection makes you want to isolate. It's the snake eating itself. I think it all depends on expectations too, but sometimes I definitely need a break from Grindr. 

I wish there was an app for gay dudes like Her."
I don’t feel like many men are going to put actual bodybuilders at the top. They look grotesque.
"You want a dick up your ass but ""no kissing or intimate stuff"".  I hate to break it to you but a dick up your ass is pretty intimate."
"Yeah, especially as a teenager I used to jack off with my hips raised up over my head so I could cum into my mouth and it was fun in a teenagey-pervy sort of way. Nowadays I am too old and lazy for acrobatics and my BF usually licks it up for me. 

I have found that other men's cum almost always tastes worse than mine ever did. "
"If I was a chef I would never serve a dish I had not tasted either. Let alone expect them to eat/like it.

So, yeah, sure."
i unironically like lady gaga i think shes a god damn talent.
Guys in porn are *a little* different from guys in real life. Now fuck me right here in front of this salad.
sounds like you need to not gain any weight gurl.
"Usually I suggest just take an embroidered hanky out of your pocket and wave it toward the gentleman in question while shouting “Yooohoooo!!!”  See how he reacts. But lately I’m wondering If just talking to people until the subject comes up would be a better approach. Also, make friends that you’re out to, they can introduce you to more people and sometimes they’ll introduce you to other gays. "
It gets better! Eventually you will make it to grad school and have no friends. 
Send him one of those spotted dicks off WebMD.
"That seems like a whole body work out. I already get tired enough from just moving my arm, dis tew much."
"When a white guy isn’t into to other racial groups it’s “racism” but when other people do it, no one cares.

Honestly, in Asia, there are plenty of guys that say “oh not into white guys, sorry” and I couldn’t care less 🙄 it’s their preference. "
"I’d suggest not to worry about abs. They’re not a requirement to be successful in the gay dating world. If someone’s so shallow as to not want to talk to you because you’re not rocking abs - that’s their loss and your gain.

Focus on being the best version of yourself. I’d take a healthy-looking man with great drive over some dipshit gym rat with abs any day."
"It's OK, but I also understand the stress.  Don't feel like you need to spend time splitting hares over this.  "
"It's really simple, but he placed few pillows under my butt, when we were having sex in missionary position. It was a gamechanger. His dick reached deepl places, I could feel him hit the spot with every thrust. It's probably because of his dick's angle."
"Ive tried multiple times. Cum just doesn't taste as good when you're not horny anymore, which is right after you cum. "
This is so romantic and perverse 😍😻😘
"If it’s really that bad it’s most likely a dental issue. That’s usually what causes bad breath. If he hasn’t gone to a dentist by this point, he’s probably not going to. "
"Sure, my best-bud from high school was living in DC and convinced me to also move there back in 1980.  We were from a small town of less then 2,000 people in Western Pennsylvania, so suddenly being in the nation's capital and a large city in 1980 was a shock in of itself.  The 1st week-end there my buddy, who was also a bartender at the DC Eagle, got me and his lover and a few of their friends to go bar hoping around town and then we ended up at the Eagle.  
I was amazed since they were all dressed in full leather and were holding hands walking the streets that no one bothered us or made rude comments.  Big eye-opener for a small-town kid (I was just 25).  I ended up going with one of the bartenders back to his house and having lots of unsafe sex all night.  About 4 months later that guy died but no one was told why.  There were loads of rumors, but nothing substantiated.
I hooked up with 2 guys who were members of the FFA and we maintained a 3-some for about 2 years.  They had a large Victorian house and threw orgies every week-end with up to 2 dozen guys.  Strangely, they liked doing drag-shows there too.  Strange seeing leather guys doing impressions of Liza and singing songs from Victor/Victoria.
I met my 1st lover about 1985 and we were together until he died in 1991.  He was an Hispanic guy from Chile and was the principal in a bi-lingual private school in Adams Morgan, where we also lived.  I was working at the Washington Post, so we had lots of incoming money so we were able to do more socializing, usually in the bars or restaurants around the city.  
We spent a good deal of time in DuPont Circle and in our own neighborhood above that area.  We both did a lot of traveling, together and separately.  After one of my trips down to Florida to help out some old lesbian friends with their greyhound farm, I answered the telephone to a male voice stating ""Don't let him fuck you ... he's carrying the AIDs virus!""  I said ""What?"" and the unknown guy repeated his statement and then hung up.  
That was in 1988 and I was then working for a company in Rockville, MD.  It was a publishing company and in our department there were about 2 dozen gay men and women.  We all decided to go down to Whitman-Walker Clinic and get tested for the virus.  Back then you were given a number for ID purposes and we were told to return in 3 days to get our results.  When we came back they handed each of us a small piece of paper with our number and either a yes or no.  I was the only ""yes"" in our group.  
Since back at that time there weren't any drugs for it, I kept it out of my head by becoming a work-a-holic.  Switched jobs and started working for Xerox and was averaging about 60+ hours per week.  Kept my mind off of the disease for several years, until my lover returned from a trip to Rio.  He started showing signs of the illness by loosing a lot of weight.  He started looking like a walking skeleton.  Then he started getting KS lesions all over his stomach, chest, and back.  The doctor said there were just as many lesions  inside too.  
He got to the point he was completely bed-ridden.  I had to quit my job to stay home and take care of him.  A lot of the teachers from his school would come over and help out so I could take breaks.  A lot of our friends also came over to help.  
At that time it was hard to get anyone to help out once they heard of the hiv+ diagnosis.  At some point he went into a coma and I picked him up and carried him out to our car and drove him to the hospital.  He was in the hospital for almost 2 weeks before he died.  He never came out of the coma.  At one point a nurse had come in to take his vitals and I noticed she put on 3 layers of rubber gloves so she could be sure to not catch anything!  I lost it and started yelling at her to get out and never come back in there.  Most all the other nurses were fantastic with him and after he died I sent them 2-dozen yellow roses, as a thank-you.
I had him cremated via a gay funeral home on Capital Hill.  We had his service at St. John's cathedral, in DC, same place President Kennedy was laid-out.  The service was in Spanish and I don't speak a single word of it, so I just did what-ever his brother did, since it was a catholic church and I'm not catholic and not familiar with the funeral mass.   
Afterwards I decided that DC had too many bad memories, so I moved back to Pennsylvania, presumably to go home and die.  That was in 1991 and obviously I never died.
One of my sister-in-laws (I had 4 back then) outed me to my parents, both as being gay and as having AIDs.  Our town is on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, so I got a doctor in the city and started going to support groups.  
Met a guy at one of the support groups who had just returned home, also to die, from California.  We got together and were in a relationship for the next 6 years.  He had contracted Toxoplasmosis and he had several lesions in his brain which affected his spinal cord to the point he had a lot of problems walking or feeling anything below his belly.  I spent a lot of those 6 years taking care of him, since I still had no signs of the disease.  
We broke up after I caught him cheating.  We still talk, but I don't want anything to do with him and he's since gone blind from the toxo now and is more ""needy.""
I didn't start getting problems until the late 90s.  After taking a drug called Videx back then, I became a diabetic (it was a side-affect from that drug).  Started having cardio-vascular problems from that and after 15 hospital visits over about 10 years I had my left leg amputated.  Now I spend most of my time sitting in a wheelchair.  I have a prosthetic leg, but it causes more problems then it's worth.  I have wound-care nurses coming here every other day because one of the incision scars on my ""stump"" started to rip open after 7 years.  Can't walk on it at all right now.  Three weeks ago I had a mini-stroke (cluster of 4) which, luckily, didn't create too many problems.  Only thing left from it is my left eye won't stay shut when I try to go to sleep.  Have to wear a mask to bed now.  Going in 2 days for a consult to see about having my right carotid artery roto-rooted.  
I've been with my current partner for 10 years now and we have since moved to Colorado, first for medical marijuana and then we stayed for the legal stuff.
Way back in the early 80s, our 1st friend who was confirmed as dying from AIDs happened in 1984.  His parents had him cremated and stuck his ashes in an empty coffee can and stuck it on a shelf in their garage.  
Between then and 1991 when I left DC, we lost about 2 dozen friends to the disease.  One guy was a male model and his face was his income, but he got KS lesions all over his face and went into hiding.  It got to the point that going to funerals were our high-lights as they got more and more extravagant.  
When I moved back to PA, the dying friends kept happening and we lost a couple more dozens of guys, and a few lesbians thrown in too.  I stopped counting dead friends after I hit 43, just couldn't handle it any more.  
I've been undetectable now for about 12 years and I'm more concerned with the cardio-vascular problems then with the hiv.  I'm currently taking 15 different meds daily, plus insulin injections.  One of my doctors back in 1994 mis-diagnosed problems I was having and put me on opiates (Vicodins), which I'm still taking!  He started me on 10 pills daily and I've since weaned myself down to 1.5 pills of the same strength daily.  The marijuana helps with getting me off the opiates.
I'm 62 y/o now and just getting tired of it all.  Technically, I've been poz now for 37 years and it does take a lot out of you.  Everyone is always saying, ""but you're still alive, so doesn't that count for something?""  I used to think so, but anymore it's just a pain in my ass, and not the good kind either.
I still drive places, but I have to load the wheelchair onto the carrier on the back of my Jeep, so it's a constant distraction for going places and doing things.  My dog isn't happy that we stopped going places since I had to stop wearing the leg.  Our yard is fenced-in, so I can just let her out there to do her thing, but she'd rather be out in the desert chasing gophers then sitting here watching the squirrels in our elm trees.
Oh well, hope this helps ya out some.  Gotta run now since my wound-care nurse is due here in about 20 minutes.  A girl has to primp ya know!"
"Not at all. You drink soda... juice... water, right? Bars serve all those things. Get a sparkling water with a twist. Nobody will care... just tip your bartender. "
"He came over to wake me up so we could go do stuff, instead of waking me he just got into bed with me and fell asleep. I wasn't mad."

This stereotype is so fucked up
I really like musicals.
Unless y'all agree to that sort of relationship.

Why not flip the argument on its head and say instead that being clean shaven is a trend?
That's a common trope in anime.
If I get an unwanted boner at the gym I just sit down at a machine and work out on that until it passes... haha
They tend to have their heart broken a lot by people who didn't deserve it and become more reluctant to give it to anyone.
"Manners.  Especially when they are expressed towards service workers, waiters and the like.  Simple and direct honesty in saying what they like and don't like, what they want, and what they are.  An easy self acceptance of their own sexuality, and an ability to accept what others are without envy or comparisons."
"That shit is actually true, bros. It can totally ruin your sex life."

"It didn't happen to me but I found this story really cute. The best friend of a guy I was dating was super supportive and he made him hold hand with him in public spaces to make him feel more comfortable and he literally forced him to go to pride with him and stuff like that. 

My best friends are great too, sadly I think I'm in love with my best friend again and I just hate dealing with that whole jealousy/pain subsystem it comes with.  It happened to me again two years ago and I got over him for a while, but now I think it's back and it sucks."
"""Please, sir, don't give me the ticket... I have a really bad week, my girlfriend broke up with me, my bank had some issues and I couldn't pay my bills in time, and this friday I have a surgery... Please, sir..."" It was a nerdy, twinky blonde guy with big glasses and sad puppy eyes."
You kind of have to have a minimum level of sociability to meet new people...
"Like, I didn't know the guy, and we decided to walk around, and randomly saw into a flu shot clinic."

"If you're looking to talk about traditionally masculine stuff like sports and cars, why not just go to a sports/car subreddit. Not every subreddit needs to have a gay counterpart. I lurk the AFL sub all the time lol.

Also, just because you don't mean to offend, doesn't make it less so. Not berating you, just letting you know."
"Not only do we check them out together, we fuck them together. "
"Buy and wear Andrew Christian underwear.

People who actually know what it is, usually not entirely straight.

Or if you just don't give a fuck, wear a Sean Cody shirt.

People who look away, not a gay. Guys who double check, probably wanna ride the dick. (I realize it's not a perfect rhyme, but bear with me here)"
Thirty to forty years of whiskey and cigarettes should do the trick
I'm not entirely sure if we're any better :v
Yeah it used to bug me how rude people can get on here but it really is a blessing especially compared to other LGBT subs where you can get banned just for having a different opinion.
Ours pushed abstinence only hard.
"Second date he came over  to my house dinner. First time coming to my house and I just texted the address to him.

He tried being cute by ringing my door bell and lying in the front yard with flowers for me. 

Unfortunately I didn’t hear the door bell as I was cooking in the kitchen and my room mate answered the door. He thought he got the wrong house and got VERY embarrassed.  Boy did I have a good laugh!

No. I prefer to drink alcohol until I am fat and sad. ***It pleases me very much.***

"This. He's there for a reason and so are you: you're both taking care of your health -- and (at least) one of you isn't fraught with guilt over that.

Visiting the STD clinic isn't something to be ashamed of. If we had less shame about it as a culture, fewer of us would get STDs in the first place."
Actually sounds like the kind of Grindr date I would want to go on!
"Yes, because muh brotein gainz

You're the sweetest guy man. Wish I had a man like you. 😍
"&gt;I didn't tell him to keep going because I wasn't sure if I was just gonna piss all over myself
