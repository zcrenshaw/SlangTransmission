good good good good good good good good vey good
"&gt;Then one by one all of his brothers and their wives said that if he couldn't come with his partner that they would not come either. 

I'll be damned. That tugs at the heartstrings."
The fact you did not ask him to choose between his parents and you speaks volumes about you as a wonderful person. May the two of you have a wonderful time together! 
"You revoked consent and he kept going. 

Yes, that's rape. "
"My husband when he is sick....

Husband: Go away, leave me alone, i dont feel good!! In sick! I have a headache, i cant breathe!! My throat hurts!!

Me: Did you take anything?

Husband: No, why should I?

Me: *sigh* Do you want some soup?

Husband: Yes please..

*Walking away*

Husband: Wait dont go! Where are you going? 

Me: To make you soup!

Husband: Dont yell at me! I dont feel good...."
I don't go to gay clubs but just today I was talking to an older lady friend whose sister and sister's baby daddy like to hang out at a gay club. I asked why a gay club and she said it's not really that gay and it's become like a normal club now and now reading this post I kind of get your complaint. 
"This isn't a top or bottom thing. If you tell someone to stop and they don't stop, it's rape."
"Not necessarily, I mean why would OP's partner want to hurt OP's Brother because OP's Mother is a douchebag?

Maybe OP and OP's partner understand that things aren't easy, and rather than causing a big fight about it, OP's partner goes to see his Brother with OP's blessing."
"There have been a lot of strange requests over the years and I learnt to respect that everyone has their fetishes. By far the weirdest was a guy who paid me to watch him make fried chicken, then eat the fried chicken in front of him and stare at him while he jerked off. It happened a few times and each time I scheduled him, I wouldn't take any other appointments that day because of a full stomach from eating chicken for an hour."
"&gt;Instead of whining that you've never had a boyfriend at age 20, try focusing on yourself and advancing your studies/career.

**AMEN**"
"It's like those posts that ends with everybody clapping, except this is actually believable. "
"Marry that shit, fool. Sheesh."
"&gt;she said it's not really that gay and it's become like a normal club now

I was at a gay club once with a friend, he approached one guy (in a respectful way) and the guy was straight and got really angry at my friend."
There ia no shame in crymaxing
"I hate to be the adult here, but did  it occur to you that this has the potential to be one big cluster-fuck. You could loose your job, he could lose his job and fuck up his life. You've watched too much porn. Real Life has different rules."
He should've been kicked out immediately. 
You can be the filling in a fuck sandwich now.
"This is why you can‚Äôt build the ideal guy in your head and then go out looking for that perfect guy. He doesn‚Äôt exist. Instead, make friends, get to know people around you, and you might discover to your shock that someone you never would have gone looking for is actually great for you.

Also, as someone else said, sometimes you have to be willing to consider folks outside your city or immediate area. Distance brings challenges but it also widens your pool. "
The month is almost over and if I keep my fluids to myself I will soon wield unlimited power. Reality will bend to my desire.
"""I find men sexually and romantically attractive and I masturbate exclusively to gay porn but when I was 11 I had a girlfriend and we held hands. Is it possible I'm gay?""

Or

""I'm a totes masc straight guy with a girlfriend and we bang all the time, but I constantly fantasize about sucking dicks and being used as a fucktoy by a muscular gay man. I'm still straight though... right?"""
The fact he got left at home alone also speaks volumes. 
"Yes, my former law theory teacher, I tried to hook up but he blocked me lol."
"That is so beautiful. I am so happy that you have an army of support on your side and it is so understandable to cry about it. In such a homophobic world, this is sometimes our own personal purgatory... and the slightest bit of support moves mountains.

I brought my boyfriend to my mom's for thanksgiving and just introduced him by name not saying he was my boyfriend....they loved him like everybody else because he's that type of fella. Well the next night, I went back without him for dinner and I told my mom that he was my boyfriend and my mom is excited for it and spent the entire next day texting me questions she has about him and everything. Her reaction is making me so happy because I've literally spent my entire life hiding from this side of me. I always thought that i would be marrying a woman (in a super positive way due to having genuine attraction to woman). In the back of my mind, though, I know I also crush so hard on dudes and the reality is, that it's possible that I will be spending my life with a man. Now I know that if boyfriend is my soul mate and I want to grow old with him, my mom will love me and him just the same."
"You don‚Äôt deserve it for snooping. He posted that shit on a public forum, so as far as I‚Äôm concerned he should‚Äôve assumed you could stumble on it anytime. Give us an update after you confront him!"
You clearly revoked consent by telling him multiple times to stop. He continued having sex with you despite not having consent. Sex without consent = rape. 
"In a world of bad news a ray of hope shines through.

This is so very nice to hear, may you have a very good day.

RIP"
"I am a total top at fucking, but my boyfriend can fuck my face as much as he wanted. I never let him cum outside my mouth, that was his ""reward"" for being my bottom :)"
Maybe I have been... üò≥üòè
"Not when you're fucking as hard as you can, and moaning so loud that your roommates decide they need to discuss it with you at breakfast the next morning."
so good
"You can't. You knew full well what you did and now it's unfolding. 

Don't act surprised. You've now made the upcoming months ahead very difficult for him, so at least leave him to recover enough to trust someone else again who actually values his time in their lives. "
He issued a cease and desist order.
"Absolutely nothing. You most likely won't feel it, physically.

Beware, though! Cum farts are a thing!"
SO MUCH VERY GOOD NOT BAD SO GOOD
"Idk I've been in similar situations, things aren't always that easy when families don't accept you but you still love them and want to maintain relationships. 

OP's boyfriend stood up to his family eventually, but these things can take time."
You can access your sexual identity through loot boxes in order to feel a sense of gay pride and accomplishment
You will quickly lose it after Destroy Dick December.
WHY ARE YOU STILL HANGING OUT WITH HIM???!!!
"On the flip side, this reason is why gay guys are pretty bad at relationships. Most of us never get to go through the High School dating experience of knowing what we want from someone until our late 20's or 30's. 

Not saying it's going to change but there's a reason why so many of us get really depressed over it. Especially having straight friends shove their relationships in your face constantly while you've never had a ""genuine"" (not sexually charged) kiss. "
Well... does it? Asking for a friend.
"I do and he hates it, so I call him bro even more. üòà"
Maybe you got the spirit in you. 
100% relatable. My husband and I both turn into needy whiny babies when we‚Äôre sick. I‚Äôm really short so I basically just cling to him like a tiny monkey and whine endlessly about the inevitability of death. 
Obama was there.
This is actually one of my biggest fears. I teach college freshmen and I'm always afraid of being messaged by one of my current students. Once they're no longer in my class it's kinda whatever.
"I'll not beat a dead horse by telling you how much you fucked up because you're obviously aware. You had the decency to tell him and own up to what you did though, so that's something.

As for getting back into the relationship? There's not much you can really do. You've let him know you cheated and that you regret it, now the ball is in his court. He might take you back, he might not, and you'll have to accept that the decision is up to him. "
"Anal missionary is really great when the geometry lines up. Kissing while f!!!ing is the best.

That said, a mirror can add a lot to doggy style."
"One time I was drunk and while reorienting to a 69 position I kneed my BF in the head.  I apologised profusely, then continued to 69 position, and kneed him in the head again."
"I tend to read ""friendly"" actions as more than they are when they're coming from a cute guy. It doesn't make you crazy -- but it also doesn't mean that your suspicions are legit. It just means you're thinking with your dick ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Maybe this guy would be a good person to tell about your new-found attraction to men. At best, he might say the same thing. At worst, his knowledge about it would give you a better perspective to evaluate the way he acts around you."
"That's fucked up, then--that straight guy should literally ""learn his place""."
I agree for the most part. Minus the agressiveness.
"I made sure I had safe sex and I would never put myself into a position that someone would threaten or force me to do anything I didn't want to do. Also, I'm not a little guy, I'm 6'2 and pretty buff these days."
Pro life tip: do not tell your employer anything you don't have to. I cringe at the thought of my employees telling me something like that. I actually cut them off if they try to give me details. All I need is a doctor's note saying you're cleared to work. 
"I nearly said I love you to a FB. For some reason I was over come with the urge to say it, luckily his dick was down my throat so I couldn't say it. "
"Best: coming home to someone on a bad day who just understands. 

Worst: picking a fucking place to eat."
"my rates were relatively steep because I had strong base of regulars that paid and tipped well that I could rely on, so it was generally $400/hr, $2,000 overnight, weekend and extended rates negotiable. I'm 30, started at 20 years old."
"Definitely whilst in NYC in the summer. One of my wealthier older clients got in contact about a trip to the Hamptons for the weekend with his gay male friends. I'd done some threesomes with him and another escort before, but never entertained several of his friends, so negotiated a price for the weekend away. Turns out the house was MASSIVE and he had extended to same offer to 19 other escorts, some of whom I knew and all of whom were really hot - jock boys and A&amp;F boys that were all really my type. They paid us to be naked and fuck all weekend, friday through to sunday, and they only joined in occasionally, so it was pretty much a non-stop fuck fest with some of the hottest guys I've ever been with."
"YES THIS X 1000.

I stopped going to our main dance because they're allowing it to mainstream and said they have no choice.  I totally relate to what you said... getting bumped into and being stared at like a zoo animal. A buddy of mine and I had a girl, fairly drunk, staring at us at the above club and eventually she started asking us stupid invasive questions, topped off by ""can I see you guys make out?""

If I go to a gay event at all now, it's an invite-list type thing that is specifically for gay guys."
I'd be interested in how a fetish like that develops.  Did he catch Mom with the Colonel when he was five or something?
"He's either just really horny/lonely, or maybe, he might be gay. But here's the thing. I had a conversation with a friend of mine the other day, saying that, in my opinion, all straight guys get *one*. By this I meant that, if the straight guy has a really good guy friend (gay or not) then he could experiment with him and still be thought of as straight. There's absolutely nothing wrong with testing the waters. Especially with a close friend you can trust.

As for G, it's hard to say what he's really feeling here. The best thing to do right now is ride out the wave. So far, it went well. You guys went back to normal conversation, you both seemed to enjoy it. I say leave the ball in his court and see what he does. Act totally normal, be playful, do what you got always did. Change nothing. If he wants more, he'll come back. And if this happens, then I think maybe you can approach the situation with your questions about him. 

Things like this can change friendships, can end them unfortunately. And you don't and that to happen. Let what happened process a while. And got from there. I know you got lots of questions. lol Give it some time. 

"
"This (gay) guy I know had a female student send him unrequested nudes. He reported it to the HR, and they blamed it on him, basically acusing him of having somehow requested the pics. He had to come out as gay to them to make clear that he didn't request or want to see her naked.

If a student tries to reach you on app clearly state that you aren't interested and save conversations, so that you don't risk anything."
"There are plenty of guys out there looking for relationships - many of you post on here complaining every day. So your options are out there, they're just outnumbered by the guys looking for sex.

You also have to keep in mind most gay guys aren't out until college or later, and thus experience ""delayed adolescence"". They're trying to ""make up for lost time"" and hook up through their 20s.

You ALSO have to keep in mind that the concept of two dudes getting married and starting a family is still very new. It has been legal for barely over two years in the US. The idea of settling down in a relationship and starting a family is completely foreign to most gay guys.

"
"I will now hereby use the phrase ""tingly mingly"" as an adjective phrase to the noun ""dick""."
The app to get me a boyfriend. 
"The guys was clearly an asshole. If you withdrew consent , you asked him to stop them it was an assault. Im sure many guys haves tried taking his 9inches and have asked him to stop.  He‚Äôs probably done this before. "
I think this sub needs pics for proof.
"I was expecting the top comment to basically be something like ""Try to blow him next time you guys get high"" 

This sub has changed "
Don‚Äôt dip your pen in company ink. 
"&gt;The best orgasms I've ever had were the few times he's gone down on me and swallowed, but I can't expect that every time we have sex, right?

Well I mean he expects you to clean out your pooper and take it up the ass every time you have sex right? So while that in it's own right is great and all I think it'd be completely fair to expect my own dick to get the same amount of attention as his..."
Jerk off before you see him once or twice if necessary.  That will slow down subsequent orgasms.
Five-three-one. One person gives five options. The other picks the three they would be okay with. The first person picks their favorite that's left.
"I can't verbalize during sex, only vocalize.  I've said a few stupid things after, though.  Like ""I love you"" to someone I just met (because he reminded me of someone else).  Oy."
"I dig deep into my wank bank - usually pornos I'm particularly fond of or hot times that I've had. Also, when I'm really in need, viagra."
As a gay bro I'd need to see these photos to make a scientific informed decision 
"There was one guy who I had developed feelings for. I wasn't sure if it was love at the time, but in hindsight, I think I did fall for him. He was genuinely a really sweet guy. He worked a lot, came out around 27 with zero gay friends and was socially awkward. He really didn't have the time nor the capacity to participate in the gay world, but he would always make time for me. Each time I texted him, he'd make an appointment, and it was always dinner/overnight or a weekend together. We had a lot in common. Plus he was hot. I shared with him my real name and he even met my friends. I wanted him to be my only client. Unfortunately, I never really got a sense of how he felt due to his lack of social skills. Nor did I ever ask because that wouldn't be professional of me. Eventually, he ended up moving to Hong Kong, so I saw him less frequently, maybe about 4 times a year, where he would fly me over or come to see me. I was elated each time and saddened each time he left. Last year, we decided just to be friends when I told him I was getting out of the hooking game."
I am a woman and I absolutely agree with you guys! 
"This was before dating apps, but I bumped into my recruit platoon commander in a gay bar. And yes we fucked"
This is very hot and it sounds like you have a very interesting sex life. Very happy for you :)
"When I am spooning him in his sleep, he will let out a little sigh of contentment. It melts me"
I‚Äôm reporting this post to the authorities 
"I started when I was 20 and like many others, a series of circumstances conspired for me to just fall into it. At the time, I had taken a gap year from uni to go travelling after deciding not to continue pursuing a career as a professional athlete. I started modelling in New York, and I quickly became into debt with my agency. They had put up my rent for months, paid for shoots and spotted me allowances. I ended up booking a lot of work during show season, but a lot of those shows were paid in trade rather than money. Whatever money I earned went back to repaying my agency. One night, I was chilling with some model friends at what turned out to be a bar frequented by escorts and as I was getting a round, a handsome older man introduced himself and we chatted for a little before he gave me his card and offered me $2,000 to come to the address on the card. It all started from there."
"Most of my clients were male. It was more comfortable for me as I identify as gay (with occasional tendencies to seek out the ladies). About one in 20 clients were female. They more often than not would be overnights or extended stays, so the money was always good and the work was always so much easier."
"Stop right there!  Don't compare your inner self to their outer selves. They may look fabulous but inside they are just as insecure or worried as you.


Some of them are thousands of dollars in debt, some gave no family who speak to them, some work at a dad end fast food job, some do Crystal Meth once in a while,  some are bulimic, some are suicidal, some don't know where they're going to sleep tonight, some have HIV, some are complete sex whores trying to fill an unfillable hole in their heart,...


Stop with the fucking nonsense!  ( Sorry, I'm yelling this to you, to myself, to everyone).  Some certainly saw you walk by and said, gosh, I wish I was as confident as HE is, I wish I had a job like him, hmm, he's fuckable....


You are enough, you have enough,  you do enough.  

Have a happy Thanksgiving!  -from your gaybro family. Xoxo
"
"Seems like there are a lot of people here who are weirdly obsessed with judging other peoples relationships. Different things work for different people.  Some like monogamy, some like open.  Neither is inherently superior and it's straight seeing a bunch of gay people being so close minded. "
This is much more relatable.
Its not just a gay thing. The Straights‚Ñ¢ do it as well

What is the strangest thing someone asked you to do?
"Best:Having someone that gives a shit that you are in bed next to him at night. 
Worst: Having been together so long, we're repeating stories.

Regarding your ""man flu"" issue: My hubby &amp; I take care of each other when we're sick, but I wouldn't dream of demanding cuddling for fear I would infect him and then he'd get sick and miss work!!! "
"I was really really lucky in my career. Most of my clients were absolutely top-rate, so it's difficult to take me as your average high-class escort because most make enough to get by, but I made enough to put me through undergrad and postgrad degrees without debt and though I man of relatively modest desires, I had enough money not to want for anything, and fly home to see family and friends whenever I wanted to, as well as having enough left over to save. I only accepted cash and never reported anything."
Sounds like he missed out on a great guy and you dont really deserve it
"Your ""Friend"" sounds like a real asshole - He baited you into sending a dick pic, you shouldn't be sorry about that, if i were you I wouldn't want that dickhead in my life.  

Seems like he is pretty gay himself, maybe he is just distancing himself from you because of his own internalised homophobia and the fact he cant deal with being a raging homosexual himself.  
Can't really offer any tips or advice on how to move past it but it seems like it would be better for you if you didn't have him in your life.  "
"haha. I'm sorry, no refunds ;-). There was a fella with an extraordinarily large penis. He had paid for a weekend, so I had plenty of time to try and loosen up and get on it, but it was just too much. He was very understanding, and we chatted a lot, and I could tell there was a lot of emotional baggage from him having such a big cock."
"Sorry... I hate to crush your ""optimistic"" figure of 18 guys... but I think you forgot to subtract the number of guys that won't be attracted to YOU.  Let's say half?  So that gives you a grand total of umm... 9.

That's pretty good math though... really puts things in perspective!"
i didn't know how little i ate until i started counting calories trying to gain weight
I thought that was going to go in a different direction. Just go easy on him at first to help him. Either that or say whoever wins gets a blowjob. It might give him some motivation.  
At least the gays wont get anyone pregnant as they watch their life crambling round them
"I do the same but at the gym... And just as straight guys say about girls: if they are wearing that, they are asking to get their dicks looked at. "
with women? They were generally rather successful and secure women. It was reflected in their emotional security and the fact that they always knew exactly what they wanted. They were a lot easier to figure out and therefore a lot easier to please.
"LOL. It tasted like delicious southern fried chicken, better than KFC. But perhaps not after the 3rd piece. "
"Nope, but I'm pissed that there's a double standard about it."
"the main reason for this, IMO, is that we as a collective group lost a whole generation of men to the AIDS crisis. so many of the men entering their late 30s and 40s today didn't have the role models of older men to show how this transition worked. gay culture hasn't always been so youth obsessed but i think growing up with mainly young men has emphasized the youth obsession. i hope that as gay men grow older, those younger can begin to find role models who show the way to grow old and still be ""relevant"" in gay culture."
Yeah I met and hooked up with an older guy off grindr about 3 years ago and didn't hear from him since aaaaand now in my 4th year at uni I find out he's my immunology professor
"I still sometimes stop and think ""fuck, I really am gay aren't I? 


Had a great date not that long ago, and I was struck by how into this guy I was. Like I was driving home just beaming. It may have been the first time I met a guy who I could actually see myself falling for big time. 

It was one of those moments where I kind of went ""look at you. Think about what you're doing right now. You're actually freaking right now, over a guy. A man made you feel this way. That's crazy.""  "
"Start off gentle. Tease the edge of the hole. Get your bottom moaning and begging for it. Then I slowly get more aggressive until I'm going to town on his ass, really getting my tongue in there. I'll spread his cheeks and spit in his hole then work my thumb in there. Lick his balls and suck his dick while my thumb is opening him up. Then I'll slowly pull my thumb out and work it with my tongue again, even harder. Usually this takes 5-10 minutes. Sometimes longer.

By this time he's pretty worked up and ready for dick and I'm ready to give it to him. "
"In a moment of cringeworthy ecstasy, I moaned, ""Fuck my boyhole!""

...the problem is that I had a little gasp in the middle of it, so it came out as, ""Fuck my bowl!""

"&gt; trust him on his word

He took off the condom during sex.  You can't trust him at all!  Sounds scummy.  "
"Until he came. He would pay for 2 hours each time, and it usually worked out to be an 1 of prep and cooking, and an hour of eating. He'd always offer me leftovers as an additional tip."
Ahhh....the good ol' procrastiwank.

"First, know that your feelings are justified and valid. Second, the choice of how to proceed is yours and yours alone, but if you stick it out with him make it absolutely clear that as the bottom YOU call the shots when he is inside you and what he wants is irrelevant. He caused you physical harm because he wasn't listening to you and was ""in the moment"". This is not an excuse. If someone tells their partner to stop during sex, they have to stop and there is no excuse for failing to do so. Make it clear to him that a similar situation WILL NOT happen again, because he WILL pull out of you instantly if you ever tell him to.  "
"It's amazing people can't see this (your) rational reply, and instead jump straight to the judgement.

This is why I absolutely fucking hate reddit a lot. Everyone reads 2 fucking sentences and jumps straight to how hard can we judge people even though we don't know shit. A short paragraph is not nearly enough information to make ANY sort of assumptions. I catch myself doing it also occasionally. But good fucking god, get down from the high horses people. Just be happy for the guy people."

Thanks Obama
Ten tingly minglies you DON'T want to miss.

"I'm so sorry. That really sucks. That's not your SO, end it asap, he assuredly did. That's crazy, that's disgusting to use brothers like that. Forgive your brother, eventually.

"This is correct, as are other statements consistent with this. Very simple thing, really."
"Besides the physical aspect of looking the part, there's two main things. You need to be naturally emotionally empathetic to make it. A lot of repeat business is about establishing connections with a client. You connect with them and they will come back, and often pay or tip you more than the previous time. Second are some character traits that you need to develop; patience, resilience and mental strength. It can be a fun but also a really stressful lifestyle."
Thank you for your service.
Well. I feel violated.

"I'm 6'2. I would consider myself handsome and have never lacked in self-confidence or attention from either sex. I am gay, though I dabble in women. There were periods where escorting was my main job. It was reactionary, I guess, particularly when demand was high. It was really exhausting and taxing on your mental state, so I had to take breaks to enjoy my personal life and to recharge. I'm newly retired because I'm also starting to do really well in my other career, the one I studied for, and something's got to give."

"Okay, it looks like we have to go over the rules of how to ask someone out when they are at work.

1) Do NOT just ask them. They are paid to be nice to customers, and it's an incredibly shitty thing to do to someone who cannot be free to let you down.

2) The proper way is to just slip him a note with your number that says something like ""I think you're cute. Call me when you're free if interested. No pressure."""

"Best: Having someone to come home to after a long day out. I remember moving out alone and just coming home after my usual days to nothing.

"Drugs are par for the course. I never really partook, but allowed my clients too, and they were often way easier to deal with.

Initially, I did fear for my safety, particularly if it was at his place rather than at a hotel, but I never encountered any. I made sure I spoke to everyone one the phone first. There was one time when someone's behaviour was not quite right, so I chose to leave. He caused a little scene but by that time I was in the hallway at at the elevator door."

"This reminds me of the time a guy tried to kiss me after what was really only a brief walk (not even a sit-down date). I barely knew him and thought it was a bit much, and it came out of nowhere!

So not knowing what else to do, I blew a quick little puff of air into his open kissy mouth. He was quite put off by it, but what can you do?"
"If it's straight friends I usually find it cute, if it's random people I could honestly care less. I'm pretty much always excited if it's a gay couple though.

However, if I saw my best friend kissing a girl, I'd probably melt because it'd be super cute, but I'd also probably yell ""that's straight"" really loud while they're doing it. He's seen me kiss more guys than I'd like to admit, but I've yet to see him kiss a girl so it'd just be a big moment that I'd soak in. He's also screamed ""that's gay"" while I'm kissing a guy one too many times, so I feel it's fair to get back at him üòÇ"

Ironically
Lol this week on 'The Straights' 
"I have the terrible habit of rambling when I'm sleepy, so after I came once I mumbled cuddling up to a guy ""I love you mommy"" which.....is about the worst thing you could say to someone you just fucked with."
Right? This got me all kinds of horny. Reminded me of this straight friend I used to exchange pics like that with until he got married. 
And for science. 
Over a big plate of breakfast sausages.
"You can hold it in no problem... Unless you sneeze, cough, yawn, or move in any way imaginable. "
"There is nothing greedy or selfish about wanting monogamy. Some people just think that a relationship and sex are very important things to be shared with just one special person. And that's just fine. Don't let anyone tell you that you're outdated or selfish. That's just how things work for you, and if someone doesn't like it, it's their bussiness."
Nope. I eat a lot. My friends are really confused that I'm not obese right now. They think I'm blessed with that but tbh I hate the fact that I can't gain weight. 
"This is why women don‚Äôt tell guys ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm not interested‚Äù or why ghosting on gay apps is common. Sometimes people take it as a personal attack, and it‚Äôs much easier to just stop talking to someone "
"I love that movie. I know a fair few escorts that do, but I never had an issue with kissing. If they had bad breath, then I would ask them to sort it out before continuing."
"I'm good friends with a gay bro from work. This exact situation happened to him a couple weeks ago. He's really close with his mom and the guy she's been dating told her that he felt uncomfortable with his overt ""gayness"". She took his side and basically told him that he needed to tone it down or move out. He's been staying with us ever since while he looks for a place. It's actually been awesome having him there. He watches girly movies with my wife so I don't have to and he's been really cool about watching our son for a couple hours if something comes up. 

I agree with you completely. Seeing how much that bitch hurt him really made me angry. He isn't even overtly ""feminine"", and even if he was who gives a shit? How the fuck can someone ask their own kid to change who they are?"
"I haven't confronted him yet. I'm ashamed to say that I've been busy crying and ranting to my friends. Sure, it wasn't a long relationship but it really meant a lot to me. He really meant a lot to me."
I'm legitimately fascinated. 
"If you has nice ass,  why not?  "
"Yes, I I took this role several times. A lot of it was just listening. It was they used me as an emotional cumdump. 

I had a few well known clients, yes."
"i am happy for you. i hope everything goes well when you do meet his parents.

it may not have sunk it yet but meeting one's in-laws (as it were) will almost certainly be a very stressful time, even without having to deal with homophobia."
"I love chicken, but the sight of fried chicken makes me sick."
"The short answer is do not.

Even assuming he's gay and not just an ""ally"", assuming he actually goes for it, sure you'll have some hot sex for a while but if you have a disagreement and get dumped youre out of a job buddy, possibly worse.

 We recently lost a girl at my company for this exact same reason and she ended up fired and up shit creek in a truckload of debt because he got her to buy a ton of stuff, even take put a mortgage, with the promise they'd pay for it together only to leave her high and dry once they split."
I think it was rape; your consent was withdrawn.
"Ohmygod. 

A fella that size decides to manhandle you, what are you gonna do to stop him? On live TV, no less!

I dunno why that big motherfucker even got in the shot, he could have just reached in from off-screen to grope the beard. "
"Everyone likes to cuddle.  It may mean nothing.

If you find yourself doing this regularly, it might mean something.

If you find yourself reaching for his dick while cuddling, it definitely means something.

Either way though, you could just be straight.  Just b urself."
"Well, then I suppose such venues should have bouncers at the door--bouncing Straight people in favor of ""Gay Men Only!"" 

In fact, maybe it has come to the point at which it would be cool to actually have ""Gay Men Only! Nights"" at...Gay Clubs/Bars.

What do you think???"
And my boner
"&gt; The worst of them all: BACHELORETTE PARTIES!!!!

something weird i've noticed is that there never seemed to be much notable oppositon to a bunch of straight people coming into a gay bar and rubbing their marriage in everyones face before marriage equality happend. how did these people not realize how disrespectfull that was"
Haha I‚Äôm already married ! We‚Äôre open so it‚Äôs all good with my hubs. He put he ball in my court on how to handle it. 
"One of my favorite teachers from high school was gay. I figured he knew the whole time I was his student because of how he interacted with me but never came out to him. I knew all about his life though, basically he was married but in an open relationship, always kind of saw him as a role model tbh.

Anyway, he saw me on Grindr and sent me a message along the lines of ""I just won a lot of bets"" and told me to look out for the crazies, which I thought was hilarious. We ended up having like a 2 hour conversation about my life being gay in high school/the military and my coming out story at home and such. Super cool.

I deleted my Grindr and lost the convo which I regret, but we're friends on Facebook/Instagram and interact there where we comment on and like each other's posts etc and keep in touch. Pretty cool honestly! "
R'AMEN
"Yeah, he should have brought a bouncer over, at least to make him realize he was still in a gay bar"
"Let's be real though. Nofap is kinda like going to AA meetings...for some, going cold turkey is the only way to get better. For people that start experiencing sexual problems in bed (Can't stay hard, unable to cum unless you jerkin da gerkin yourself, no libido outside porn) sometimes nofap is the solution. It's kinda like a hard reset if you abide by it for long enough.

As with most things in life though, moderation is key. And if you're not a compulsive pud puller then you can probably safely masturbate once in a while and notice no ill effects. Basicaly, nofap probably wasn't meant for you and that's ok because for the people who turn to it frequently have success. "
For some reason my mental image of this is both amusing and adorable...
"The worst is when you are the one who has to carry their lazy/incompetent asses through the day, and you will never get any credit because it will involve the manager having to admit he is crap at hiring."
Sounds like some good dick
Booooo! You whore!
"Man you got it all backwards. It‚Äôs your SO who‚Äôs not good enough for you, and your brother is an asshole. Honestly I would just straight up interfere in their chatting next time. Just type ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been reading these all along and I hate you both‚Äù or something. Fuck this shit, you deserve better. It sucks and I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs best to just end it now. You‚Äôll be fine, it‚Äôll suck for a while but you‚Äôll be okay.

You have worth and you are good and you deserve better. Don‚Äôt let them get away with this."
"I guarantee you that your caloric intake is less than what it should be, your friends watch you binge eat for a moment which gives them the perception that you eat a lot."
Have you ever tried volunteering at homeless shelters and soup kitchens. They‚Äôre always in need of more helping hands. Maybe you can find some joy in that.
"Sounds like you need to leave him !  

Take the dog too 
"
It does sound like he's fucking guys in Arkansas and wants to ease his guilt by making you do it too.
"Breaking news, healthier looking successful people are more attractive!!!!

Duh "
So find someone else not interesting enough. 
You'll want to sit on the toilet after.  Unless you like laying in it after it seeps out.
"We do now. It was great before but now she gets to see me in another light, one that arouses her. 

I thought it would turn her off but it is the opposite."
"According to your history you're 16 so the real problem here is that you're dating a sexual predator. Run away, don't walk, run "
Girl got the *Holy Ghost* LOL
What did you study in school? 
/r/gaystrugglefuck
"Same! I am a TA at a college right now and I actually have been messaged by some of my students. As much as I want to go for it in the primal, lustful sense, my morality prohibits me from doing so. That, and I really don't want to lose my job. lol"
"&gt; And just as straight guys say about girls: if they are wearing that, they are asking to get their dicks looked at.

ummmm I feel like this line of thinking isn't going in a good direction"
Dude. Don't pay for porn. Just use my vidster. 
Just be careful in case you get pregnant... 
Update: I‚Äôm at the hospital now getting the pills. Thanks all!
Shit
I ain't clicking a sexual health link from buzzfeed. Nope.
"You can do both. If you realize the significance of those other things in life and it allows you to be a bit more confident and secure, you may be able to approach dating in a more casual and relaxed way. Those are great dating and sex years, no need to waste them. You just need to make sure sex and dating aren't the focal point of your life."
"I'm usually top but have tried and am open to being bottom.

I still find that physically it can be unpleasant, but I can get over that.

The only thing that turns me off is if the top guy really views it as a power game, then it just makes me uncomfortable and I'm not into it.

I won't bottom for hookups."
No.  They refuse to believe I'm gay and continue hitting on me.
That's rape.
"It's mostly a psychological pleasure, but I swear, I feel the top's cock twitch and pulse as he comes in me when it's bare. Something I don't feel when it's wrapped. I like it :)"
He's crazy because precum is amazing 
Dude sounds mega bisexual with a bunch of internal homophobia going on in his head.
*finger guns* ZOOP
"The question to ask is: why are you still associating with this person?

A phrase my coach used to tell us was ""the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results"". 

Stop hanging out with him and expecting him to change.... "
This sub has made me realize how much shit some people put themselves through and it never ceases to amaze me. 
RIP?
"&gt;on

Sure! *In*? Nah..."
"I didn't have to suck any, actually a lesbian hired me. But the manager did suck my dick once when paying me. "
"lmao people in this subreddit are really judgy

OP, you made a mistake, and you're never ever going to be able to take it back. The ball is in his court, I would send him a text or a voicemail to make your wishes known, but leave it at that.

He might take you back, but don't hold your breath."
Smiling.
"I don't mean to be hard, but you may have been close to your brother, but he is not close to you.  Anyone who would betray an intimate to procure an orgasm is malignant in their personality.  This isn't a drunken slip at the Christmas party.  This is an ongoing betrayal conducted behind your back.

RUN, DO NOT WALK, TO THE EXIT!"
"One of my exes was naked and showed his ass in a movie just before I met him, didn‚Äôt bother me at all, was kinda proud of him actually. He didn‚Äôt have any roles like that come around while we were together, but if he did I woulda been fine with it and supportive as long as it wasn‚Äôt porn."
How much did you charge? How old are you?
I‚Äôd take a screenshot and make it my wallpaper on my work laptop with a big note over it that says THATS MY BOYFRIEND SUCKERS!!!   Then I‚Äôd have that chat with HR. 
After reading the first three sentences I was ready to tell you that you were a piece of shit.  Then after reading the fourth sentence I started laughing.
I need them for a school project
Imo dude doesn't deserve any further acknowledgement. 
"Some no fap bullshit, what's up with people denying themselves that pleasure, some act as if baby Jesus cries every time you nut off."
"I don't think so. Many have certainly gone through that period of severe infatuation. They would try to rebook you almost immediately and frequently, but then their infatuation dies off."
This is no doubt the most accurate post I've seen on this website. 
How do you get hard for people you're not attracted to?
He puts up with my bullshit.
Yeah. I favorited him on my landscape account to creep on his profile updates.
girl how did this topic come up
"I get it. It's one thing if there is a drag show (which I hate) or some sort of other entertainment. But when it's done in way so they can 'hang out with the gays' and the clientele becomes their entertainment, it's pretty annoying. 

I've lived in a lot of places and numerous times have seen gay bars open in the up and coming neighborhoods, their popularity grows, the straight crowd trickles in and then a few years later a good gay bar is closed and it turns into a sports bar. It starts out with the straight girls, then they bring a straight guy or two, then the swingers come in looking for fun, the straight men get mad they're getting hit on by other men, then it's majority straight, then it's a frat bar with football on the TV's. "
It was more the conversational and emotional part that was easier with women. It was much easier than with men.
"When I hug him from behind and he starts to grind, ever so slightly, so that I feel it but everyone else can't see.... hooooo boy"
I completely agree with this 
Is this shit for real?
"Some gay guys, when ""coming out"", used bisexual as a stepping stone. Instead of admitting they are gay they say they're bisexual, because it seems less more acceptable or because they're still figuring things out. So, when they finally do admit they're gay, they project their past on to other guys, which creates the ""There aren't bisexuals, only gays in denial"" thing."
One time when we were fucking when I was about to cum he shouted in my ear in a really nasally voice ‚Äúgive me those cummies!‚Äù And started cracking up. It was the worst orgasm I‚Äôve ever had. God I love him.
Me. I find missionary to be better for gay sex honestly. 
Everyone can appreciate a good looking guy or girl-regardless of sexuality.
yup when you get a little peek of the bare belly 
"Sure.  One of them loved it, got a little clingy thinking there was more to it than just a random drunken threesome, decided we were dating... it was ugly.  Skip ahead a dozen years and I bump into him at a pride event, where he introduces me to his husband as ""one of my old lovers.""  I'm like ""Um... no, we tricked once"" and bounced.  Ugh."
"No.  Dont make Thanksgiving about you.

Also, you don‚Äôt need to make a big production out of coming out of the closet.  Just live your life as an out guy and stop pretending to be straight "
"I think there are two gay lives:

The vibrant party life we see in shows like Looking and Queer as Folk...

And the lives people actually lead.

Since we don‚Äôt grow up surrounded by other gays, it‚Äôs very easy to think media depictions are normal.  We actually believe all gays are rich but never work.  That we‚Äôre party animals but also professionals.  Promiscuous but never have any health or social complications.

Reality doesn‚Äôt work like that.  If you go out drinking every night, you‚Äôre gonna struggle at work and you‚Äôre probably not gonna live in an amazing loft.  And you‚Äôre certainly not going to bootstrap yourself into that situation before 30.

I see a lot of people on here who seem to think that ‚Äúbeing gay‚Äù is the mutually inconsistent set of expectations we see in media.  Even in this thread, I see a lot of ‚Äúgo out and party‚Äù, as if that‚Äôs a doable thing for someone who is in, say, medical school.

To me, that delusion is, by far, the greatest problem of how we are socialized."
"No worries. Thanks for sharing! Glad to hear that you found someone who‚Äôs open to your sexuality and also likes to watch.

It sounds like you won the lottery to me, you lucky buck üòâ"
Damn. I'd love to have an escort job where I'd just eat chicken. Sign me up! 
I still have a sister who I'm close to. Just not my parents.
"I think the whole 'best years of your life' being in your twenties is inaccurate for a lot of people--especially gay dudes, imo. I see our thirties as being a prime time in our lives, but you never really know when those years will be. 

Personally, I think our twenties consist primarily of working towards something. Earning an education to get the career you want, building a credibility in your career, navigating the ""real world"" with various expenses. IMHO, our thirties are (for most people) a time where they've reached a place where we can enjoy what we've been working towards in our twenties. We're still young and horny, and we've learned a lot of social/relationship lessons the hard way in our twenties. That's just how I see it, anyways."
"Well, they can't really enforce ""gay"" men only, how would you even check that?  But instead they will have ""men"" only.  And having no women at all generally stops any straight guys from being interested.  Unless they're ""curious"".  I've seen it in Europe, and in Asia it's common.  

In Canada, I'm not sure it's exactly legal, but there are clubs that are de facto men only, as women will be made to feel uncomfortable there.  In the end it's the same result."
