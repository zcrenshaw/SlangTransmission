Don't be. Precum is awesome. 
"I'm a black gay dude, and I think it's complete bullshit. Oppression and discrimination is just that. I don't think it's fair or wise to play a ""who has it worse"" game where this stuff is concerned. Blacks and gays have (present tense) similar struggles, but the persecution/discrimination manifests in different ways.

I had a girlfriend try to argue me down about this one time, and I reminded her I have my foot in both rings. I have faced more bullshit from being gay than I ever have being black, if one wants to play that card. And I grew up in the deep south.

Also, not all gay men can ""hide"" who they are. No matter how hard some of us try to ""butch it up"", we will always be targeted as a fag (you can ask some elementary school kids) before many of us even know what the word means. 

Again, as a black gay man...I call BULLSHIT. 

I think some blacks like to use that ""don't compare gay rights to black civil rights"" because they view the *homosexual lifestyle* as beneath them. Many also feel that we CHOSE this ""life""...so it's not comparable. *eyeroll*

It's very transparent, and you would think they would know better. Unfortunately, being a minority doesn't necessarily bring one compassion and empathy for others.

It is what it is, but I call bullshit. This isn't an oppression olympics situation. Shitty, unequal treatment is shitty, unequal treatment. They don't want to be linked to us, but whether they like it or not...we're fighting for the same things."

Don't tell the thirsty bitches around here that there's a chance their straight best friend might start falling for them. It's just cruel.

"Wtf? Gay men love that shit, me included."
"A while back there was a guy on here who had a boyfriend who lost his cock and balls in an accident of some kind when younger. Also there are FtMs.

So hopeless no, very tough, yes."
I wonder how many guys saying it's a deal breaker don't realize how gay their voice sounds… 💅

"Thanks pal. Little do people know what us fems face.. When we walk into rooms, there's a variable acting against us: The people's perception of our demeanor. We're fighting for our words and thoughts to be taken seriously. With our voices, our gravitas is discounted. Made fun of. Spat at. 

And for fucks sake, can people PLEASE stop assuming that we all bottom and are submissive. What a fallacy to assume this as de facto!"
"Yes.

You should point out that the real Nazis would have put him in a death camp for being a Slav, though. It probably won't change his mind, but it'd be funny as fuck. "
I was using a hottub with four straight male friends. The host had a rule that no clothes were allowed (I don't know why). One of them slipped getting out and landed with his junk across my face. There was a lot of screaming and I banged my head on the rim of the tub from the impact. Not as sexy as it could have been.
"My friend asks me ""would you suck ten guys off at once for a million dollars?"" so I say to him ""hell yeah! I'd pay anything to suck ten guys off at once"".

"I was openly gay at my first corporate job and had several male friends who were ostensibly straight. One of these guys suggested that we take a trip to the casino to play some poker. We get there and, after cards, he suggests that the two of us then go to the dance club at the casino and have some drinks and fun. This gets my gaydar whirring a bit...it's not the usual activity to suggest with your openly gay friend. I figured that he was ""curious"" and looking to hook up. I was young and he was cute, so I went along with his suggestion. After a few drinks he says ""let's go on the dance floor. It'll be fun!""

Well...he danced alongside me but, as I found out later, had no interest in hooking up. He later said that he figured two dancing guys would be better able to pick up women. You can take a second and just imagine how awkward that 10 minutes of dancing was. Poor bastard had three too many drinks and zero rhythm, so he was just sort of bouncing back and forth trying to smile at me and make eye contact. I was just confused. The ladies stayed away...not a surprise given that I was singing along to the EDM songs. 

Then his flailing hands brushed up against my ass. I think his whole life flashed before his eyes in that moment because he sobered up faster than anyone I'd ever seen in my life and said ""I'm getting dizzy...we should sit down."" After that, we chatted a bit and then went home. He kept his distance as bolted from the car once we got to his house. 

He apparently had no clue that I might have taken his suggestion to go to the club as an advance. At least not until his hand was on my left ass cheek. He admitted as much at a dinner with friends several months later. He apologized for ""blue baling"" me. Our co-workers laughed so hard, one of them had to go to the bathroom to avoid pissing her pants!"

"I think you need to talk about this with him extensively.  Why the friend?  I think that is more problematic than with an anonymous guy.

Also:
&gt;would rather die than break up with him or to lose him to somebody else.

This is a little scary.  I hope you're exaggerating a bit.  Otherwise, this sounds like a potentially unhealthy scenario (even without the hook up) you may want to examine further."

"With boyfriend what I did was this: 

We kissed, nipple play, cock rubbing for like 15 minutes (basically like just making out), then I went down on him and sucked his cock for a long time and played with his hole a little too. 

THE IDEA OF THIS IS TO MAKE THE BOYFRIEND (THE BOTTOM) HORNY AND RELAXED. 

After that, I ate his ass (well, if you don't like it, or the guy is not into that you can then go to the next step) for super long in different positions, he on his belly, then on his back. 

Then I sucked his cock more but this time I put lube on my finger and I put it inside while sucking him. I didnt move, I let him push me inside when he was moving his hips, as I said before, you need to feel ready, relax, but most important, horny. After that and playing a little more, I stopped sucking him but I moved my finger inside and I grabbed his balls with my other hand. 

(That feels pretty good for him, but idk if it will work for you). 

Then Put some more lube, and I put another finger inside (now there were 2), and when he wasn't even looking because he was just enjoying this (also nipple play, kissing is very important) I went inside of him. I let him guide me, if it hurted, I stopped until he relaxed again, always inside. Then I waited until he started moving again and I did my thing. After a couple of minutes he was not in pain anymore and we had lots of fun!"

Physics is kinda my thing. We could also talk about complicated stuff, like feelings, which we did...a lot...he had some major internal struggles. 
Because of the age difference, the parents once showed up at my home and told me and my mom I was creepy, they wanted me to stay away from the kid. I did...

Years later when I was still in my 30s, I encountered the mom, her son is now dead from drug overdose and she apologized to me and cried a bit and explained how she regretted it and how he had begun to change soon after that forced ""breakup"". ... Will never know the reason...but sometimes age is just transcended

I wish I had told his parents to fuck off and stayed in contact with him. "

"Straight people hitting up LGBTQ places is usually fine, here's when it's not:

- groups of overly dramatic straight girls who harrass guys asking why they can't be straight or going overboard with ""yass queen"" and their quest to find a gay bff
- straight guys hitting gay clubs to ""get the chicks"" and then acting all offended if a gay dude hits on them
- bouncers/servers/waiters/valets showing any kind if contempt or giving off a homophobic vibe. Like, you chose to work there/that night knowing it was an LGBTQ event, at least pretend to be indefferent.

Playing hard to get is middle school BS. It kills attraction.
"Two reasons.

Monogamous couples tend to drop out of the ""scene,"" and often mainly socialize only with other couples, which doesn't suit people who have a strong stake in keeping the ""community"" as inclusive as possible. This can also create the *illusion* that monogamous relationships aren't the norm, because it leaves the ""scene"" mostly populated by single people and those not interested in exclusive relationships.

Also, when you're exclusively homosexual, you have an extremely limited dating pool. Every two guys who pair off and decide to be sexually exclusive reduces that further, and obviously that isn't in the best interests of those who're looking mainly just for sex. (Not that this creates any obligations on the part of anyone else.) Therefore, it can be discouraged by people who try to claim that monogamy isn't ""part of the lifestyle"" or whatever."

You are pretty. 
"One of two things will happen - you'll either be single and depressed for the rest of your life, or you'll come to the realization that there is far more to you than what's between your legs. That you are worth being with, and if you have a thick enough skin, you'll find plenty of people that will see that too. Plenty of people have jumped much bigger hurdles than you to find a partner. You can do it.

Understand that we all have scars. Perfect imperfections. Some people hide theirs away, others, like yourself don't have that luxury. But don't let anybody make you feel that just because your scars are obvious, that the rest of us have none to hide.

If I can offer a more practical suggestion - be upfront about it. Put it in your profile and save yourself some time by weeding out people that just aren't a match for you."

"...out there, in the wild?!

"There has been a marked contrast between myself and my three lovers, and even between myself and every person I ever dated.  It has always been part of the combustion for both myself and my partners.

I am a 6 foot stocky athlete.  Basically a military kind of build.  Three year letterman in school, martial artist, etc.  My first lover was petite, but a ballet dancer.  Talk about fit!  He was amazing.  My second was a slender savate artist that only came up to my nose.  He was slightly effeminate, fabulously humorous, and the toughest most dangerous guy of my personal acquaintance.  My third and current lover is a compact 5'2"" immigrant from Vietnam.  We have been together for 19 years.  He is profoundly fit, and a practitioner of the martial art of Kali.

There has been a funny incongruity to all three of these relationships.  I am the much bigger partner, and quite athletic, but they are the one that folks quite accurately consider the dangerous one.  They are the ones with the protector vibes.  Tough hombres."
"In retrospect my attraction to men started as soon as I hit puberty.  The wet dreams about my male friends should have been a clue, as should the obsessive eyeing of wieners at the urinals, and the stealing of jockstraps and underwear from gym bags, and the gay porno mags outnumbering the straight porno mags.  That whole thing where I would I met my buddy after class and would fuck him in the woods regularly when I was 17 *really* should have set the alarm going off.

It's kind of pathetic how long you can deny reality when you're even the least bit attracted to women though.  ""Nah, I'm just really sexual and horny, right?  It's not like I'm bi-going-on-gay and 80% sexually attracted to men and with no romance at all for the ladies..."""

"When I was younger, I always fancied myself to be far more submissive than I really was. I normally tried to find guys who matched my physical appearance or were relatively tall. 

I'm 6'3, 220 solid and have been since I was about 20. I remember one night going out to the uni bar and this TINY TINY guy started hitting on me. I'd never found myself too attracted to smaller guys but I said fuck it and took him home.

Dude. 

I then learned the joys of what I came to call ""Rag doll"" sex. I had never felt like such a man before in my life. He was all of 5'2 and 120 lbs and I could have sworn that I was going to kill the fucker a couple of times, but he held up!

That started a fetish in me for TINY TINY guys and it kinda stayed that way until I met my husband whose six inches shorter than me, but far more fit and built than me.

If you feel someone is judging your relationship and that bothers you, you can simply exit the friendship if it's that bad."

"OP was busy shuffling some papers when he heard the phone ring. OP was nervous...he knew who it would be but he was still hesitant. *Ring...* OP's hand went to the phone and put it to his ear. ""Yes?"" he squeaked. ""I want you in my office. Right now."" The voice was unmistakable. The authoritative tone of OP's manager came across like an electric jolt that ran straight to OP's crotch. He shuffled in his seat and slowly got up, trying to conceal his growing hard-on from his coworkers, as images of OP's manager raced through his horned up mind. 

He walked down the hall, in anticipation of what would be next. Thoughts of his manager raced by. Was he upset? He seemed very serious and stern. He reached his manager's office and knocked. 

""Come in.""

OP opened the door to find his manager standing behind his desk.

""Close the door.""

""Yes, sir.""

""I've been wanting to see you here. But don't worry. It's just you and me. Now, on your knees!""

OP got down, feeling the carpet with his hands. He looked up at his manager. 

""I've been upset at your performance OP. Sales have been falling. You do want to continue working here, don't you?""

OP stammered, ""Oh yes sir, I love being here and wake up every day looking forward to my job.""

""I thought so. You see, OP, I know your little secret. I've heard you wanking your little pecker in the men's room.""

OP's face flushed. 

""Yes. I sometimes go in just to brush my hair. Sometimes I use the mirror just to admire myself. And I've heard you moan. I've heard the unmistakable sound of you beating off, whimpering my name out loud right when you were about to blow.""

Before OP could utter a word, his manager said, ""Crawl up to me.""

OP did as he was told. His eyes were fixed on his manager's magnificent, beautiful body and his impeccable style. No matter how much time OP spent dressing and working out, he was no match for his manager.

Finally he got to his manager's shoes. He could smell his cologne.

""Stand up.""

OP stood. His manager looked at OP and OP felt his manager's gaze. He felt his manager's big strong hand (more like a paw) on OP's face, causing OP to tremble. His manager opened his lips.

""You make me *sooo aroused.*"""

[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1845/)
"I have had the same argument with a good friend. 

TRUTH: Civil Rights ARE gay rights. 

While it is very true that gay people are similar in skin color where as African Americans are not, gay people often experience overt discrimination regardless of their so called ability to ""blend in"".  

It is always in the best interest of all minorities to stand up for all minority groups civil rights. To not support gay rights while supporting civil rights is to engage in ""selective"" bigotry. To compare discrimination as a basis of deserving civil rights is patently ridiculous. 

Black Lives Matter. Gay people deserve rights too. No one deserves discrimination.

OH...I guess gay people haven't been through segregation. I guess gay people haven't been enslaved. I guess gay people have no rights that matter. 

Well....many gay men have lost jobs when bosses became aware of their sexuality. 

Many gay people have been killed for being caught being gay. And then the police and courts have failed to defend them or uphold justice. 

Many gay people have experienced housing discrimination. Many gay people have experienced job and salary discrimination. 

You are right. Civil rights are gay rights. 

She is wrong.

"FWIW, in fetish or extreme body modification terms, you’d be called a nullo. It might be worth to do some research into that subculture, even if it’s not your cup of tea.

I guess you already have exhausted the options of reconstructive surgery? Know that what is possible and utterly impossible also depends on the surgeon. If you haven’t done so already, talk with an expert in phalloplasty and not a run of the mill surgeon. But even then, lots of guys will find that weird.

Without a penis, you deviate quite a bit from the gay ideal. That doesn’t mean that you’ll be forever alone by all means - but you might have to look differently for a partner than you otherwise would. 

Stereotypically speaking, change the subculture of guys you date. Expecting an average 19 year old vain jock, dealing with his own issues about masculinity, to understand your struggle and not care about your deviance from the gay ideal, might be asking for a bit much. Date older, date more mature, date more queer and less gay. Look for guys calling themselves omnisexual, pansexual, genderblind, queer etc. While gay subculture often subverts ideas of masculinity and femininity, both are still very important concepts. In short, look for people with less strict views on the subject and start looking for dates in that subgroup."

Try look for a single gay guy who is looking to date, not just hook up. Don't settle for guys that just want sex in the hopes that they'll change their minds. Don't settle for guys that are cheaters. Don't settle for guys that are mostly into girls but will let you blow them when they're horny!

Don't shift blame away from your own poor decision-making, it doesn't sound like this has anything to do with your femininity. Date people that want to be with you. Don't date people that don't. Move forward with this strategy and I promise you will have less relationship drama."
"I want to be able to tag people so I don't forget who they are. ""Feet weirdo"", ""Angry slut"", so on."
"Only if they're screaming, ""Yaaas queen, slay!"" When they orgasm."
So I don't have to hold in my farts.
"When I was 12 the girls in my class grouped together and tried to pull any boys trouser down, the boys to lift the girls skirt. Being a good Catholic school (I know!) Neither side actually did anything for fear of getting into trouble......until the day one boy went too far by being rough and the girls ""pantsed"" him in the middle of the playground. I was gutted that I missed it as he sat opposite me and I had a bit of a crush on him although at the time I didn't realise it for what it was."
"I just love a guy who literally wants you and desires you. The best thing about it is the passion, the intensity, and the fire it generates like when you finally get together with the guy and you can't get enough of each other, the intense making out, the feeling of his lips, how he feels inside you and you don't want him to get out, and you want more of him just like uuuuughhhhhhhh you know, ya feel?!?!!!! FUCK!"
Just love that you ended your post with shoot! Someone is going to make a joke!
"Why do gay guys always check out of their hotel room on time?


Because they get their shit packed the night before."
"Don't be, precum is so hot and delicious. I wish I made more than I do "
"If it gets my dick closer to his ass, I'm all for it. 😜

Butt seriously, I like taking care of nurturing people... not just my date/bf. So having close knowing that I'm the one making him feel safe makes me feel as good as he does in my arms feeling safe. "
Nevermind the casual misogyny
"This^  

I just absolutely knew. Every time something having to do with men on men or bi or gay came up I would experience excitement. All the while proclaiming myself to be straight and hoping no one noticed the irony. "
When someone starts a conversation with dick pics.
"I don't know about the other guys here, but if my 14 year old child was hanging out with a 32 year old man he met online, I would be wildly investigative and worried.

There's a reason we're having this conversation in the first place and the fact that OP is weirded out should lead you to believe his ex boyfriend may have an ulterior motive."
"I think [this is the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2z62s0/help_penis_envy_is_poisoning_our_relationship/) he's talking about. I saved it cause it was really sweet and had a happy ending (in more ways than one.) I hope hearing that guy find a loving bf gives you some hope.

Also I hear that FtMs can get a penis grafted from like taking some meat from their arm? I'm honestly not sure how it works though or how functional/sensitive it is, you might want to ask a transmen subreddit to know more. "
"I knew two lesbians who both called Amy. No hilarity ensued, but they did get pretty annoyed when everybody called them ""The Amys"""
That might be worth a call to the cops.  It depends on exactly what went down.
Of course you're not. 
Press F to pay respects.
"Life is to short to do things you hate. 

Sex is supposed to be fun. 

Do the things you like and seek a guy who will let you top him. "
My dicks out right now. 
"Okay, okay. Just for you. 😏

"I don't understand how parents can disown their children.. 
but if they are the type of people that can and will do that, then I highly doubt they will be accepting of your sexuality. Either way you'll be miserable back home, whether it's hiding in the closet or it's being disowned and hated by everyone around you back home. 

I'd stay where you are happy and established/independent. 

Maybe now is a good time to come out to them as well as telling them you're staying where you are. 2 birds 1 stone. 

I'm sorry you have narrow minded parents, but I believe you can still surround yourself with people that love and care about you "
"years of gay porn. Also when I was 11 I went to Barcelona for a family vacation, at the beach all the other guys I was with were looking at the topless women, I was more fixated on their boyfriends"
I've hooked up with a few. 
"It was the house of some hippy dude in Berkeley, CA. It was also a salt water hot tub, so maybe there were different cleaning requirements. "
"What haven't I experienced on grindr. I'm a light skin African American.

I've had multiple white men tell me that "" I'm not normally into Black guys, but you're hot haha."" 

uhhhhhh, that's a not a compliment. I also got messaged from a guy who had ""no blacks in his profile"" and when I asked him why was he messaging, I'm clearly black. This mofo said ""You're light enough for me.""   One guy wanted to role play master and slave.  And people wonder why i'm so cautious when I  talk to non black POC on these apps."

Things that are unattainable or a challenge are typically attractive
It's some barbershop called Daddy's.
Lmao asking what really matters 
My condolences from Mexico
Depends. Do parents of this boy know about this?
Hell yeah it's hot especially when I can see those nips
"I feel like if you're going to make the decision to stop hanging out with people who have sufficiently objectionable ideas, getting rid of Nazi supporters is a fairly obvious place to start."
"I mean, you're an adult, just tell them you spent the night with the dude."
"well, this is definitely reassuring considering i'm 5'4 and want to pound some ass"
"lol all the time. He can be a muscle bear God but if he lisps ""YAS HUNNY"" we're done. I can't. This kills the penis."
Where are you from? Most gays that I have come across are not feminine.
He will love it. What you don't realise is for much of their time therapists are bored as fuck. A coming out session will be the highlight of his day. 
"It's not a bad thing to want a partner. But be careful in doing this. If you seek validation by being with someone, you are likely going to end up in a string of bad relationships. You need to be happy being you, being on your own, that way you are not desperate and have that **need** to be in a couple to feel complete.

Otherwise, you will say yes to first opportunity that comes along, even if they are bad for you. Realise  your own self worth first.

""People accept the love that they think they deserve."""
"gay nazis are like, doubly stupid. you either have to be completely brainwashed from birth or like, actually fucking retarded to be a nazi as a gay person. like, there's just no coming back from that.

yes, you should disown that moron."
Thanks man. 
This sounds so hot I want to go to one so bad but idk where to find them. I wanna feel the thrill of having sex with a hot stranger ;p
Mine was Taylor Lautner in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl
It's crazy popular with everyone. 
"Walking hand in hand or a peck on the lips or cheeks is fine, but making out in public in inapropriate regardless of the genders involved. IMO at least."
"LMAO I burst out laughing at this comment.. Just to add on to this train of thought, how the fuck could anybody be UNAWARE of RUBBING their genitals on something??"
"I think there's a big difference between voice, and the personality behind the voice. I have dated and slept with a few guys with more feminine voices in terms of pitch and softness, but not the personality you're describing. I'm not into bears at all, but if I heard one say the same words you just said in a low gravelly voice, I'd be incredibly turned off as well.  Give me slight, soft spoken nerdy boys over that any day. "
That big huh?
Even the ugly people are shallow af
"""Excuse me, does this scarf smell like chloroform to you?"""
"I still live at home and the few times I've stayed over at someone's I said I was staying at a friend's after we went clubbing. 

I don't think they believe me for one second but you could say it's a friend from uni and they've commuted to visit "
I completely lose interest when a guy is unattainable...
Mine had a foreign accent and because he was also a lifeguard at the pool he wore a speedo all the time instead of underwear...swoon
Hoooooneeeeeey
"I was at swim training. The squad was just warming down from the main set. I was swimming down the lane doing backstroke. I was doing my thing. Arm comes out of the water, goes back a little too wide, under the water, next thing I know I'm brushing some guy's stomach. He grabs my wrist and pushes my hand away before I reach his, well, you know. I nearly died of embarrassment! "
Batman. He's rich. 
So fucking true. There can be hundreds of people in front of me but my eyes will automatically lock on to the guys wearing tank tops. 
Is it weird that I'm turned on by this?
omg that story is both adorable and hilarious
I usually don't respond. That stuff is a huge turn off. 
"Unshaven has its merits no?

"Maybe you should move to a better place. I have never had that problem since I moved. No one cares here. If you're gay, everyone shrugs. I was in a shop and the guy who left was cute. I said as much. He winked, despite holding hands with his gf and the cashier who said he was straight high fived me. 

Move somewhere where you can be you."
"If someone is trying too hard, yes. 


If they have a natural inflection, nope. That's like being straight and turned off by women with lower voices. As long as personality is there, who the fuck cares. "
"I wish it had a feature where if someone says hey 5 times without an response an auto response would say ""I don't think he's into you bro""  "
"Hmm... taller than me is definitely a thing. I like brown eyes. But my biggest weakness is if he's passionate about any kind of music. Doesn't have to be my music, but if I find out he's strongly into any kind of music I just want him immediately."
Buena verga es buena verga! Bien por ti :) 
"1.  This is not about you. 

2.  He's doing you and himself a favor if his family is homophobic.

3.  Funerals are never the right time to introduce a new partner to family."
"THANK YOU for your post!

Here is my opinion:  A lot of gay men start out as fairies, queens, faggots.  Then, they ""decide"" to ""man up.""  

We hide a huge part of ourselves.  I know that this is my story.  

I was a little fairy, and I manned up to avoid being beaten up.

Skip ahead a few decades.  All of my ""feminine"" interests and characteristics are still in me, and I want to express them with other men.

But, I am so conditioned to act ""masc"" that I find it difficult to express my femme self in public.  

Since I do not go to clubs or bars, I cannot even locate other femme men.

So, here I am!  Let's make jewelry together!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Sounds like the gay version of a neckbeard, trying to imitate a ""sexy, dangerous man"" Call the cops if he ever approaches again, nothing more to be done for it."
"When people get pissy when you don't respond. Girl I've never met you I don't owe you anything. Then when they keep messaging you and you finally say you're not interested, and they say ""lol that's ok you're ugly anyway"" or ""you've only seen one pic of me you shallow scum"""

"I don't think you should have felt horrified. I've always known that I'll never pass for a jocky type ""straight"" guy. I'm a nurturing mental health provider who enjoys baking, playing video games, gardening, walking nature trails, target shooting with my boyfriend (he introduced me to it), reading, chess, and crafts.

When you spend your days studying human cognition and behaviors, as well as providing therapy to others, you learn that most people aren't ""masc"" and ""fem."" Instead, the vast majority of humans fall somewhere in the middle in both interests and traits. It's okay to be you."
"&gt; That whole thing where I would I met my buddy after class and would fuck him in the woods regularly when I was 17 really should have set the alarm going off.

I do feel like that would be a good clue, yeah."
"Pozing/bugchasing

While sufferers of HIV who treat it and deal with it responsibly shouldn't be stigmatized, those that intentionally spread the disease absolutely should be. I can think of nothing more disgusting than purposely increasing the incidence of a terrible, incurable (and expensive to treat) disease."
"If you're fine with him having sex with other people, that's one thing, but thinking about cheating isn't anything near the same as actually having sex with someone else.  

In any kind of open arrangement, the possibility of developing feelings for someone else is a risk you accept.  It's also why a lot of open couples say no sex with friends. "
"Wow, only one state into bears? Guess I'll have to check out Wyoming some time and see what's up. "

"#You do not deserve to be hit, be made scared, or be abused- no one does.

He might seem like he's being a better person, but like all abusers, there is the cycle of abuse. It's going good-he gets angry- he hurts you- he says sorry- he is super nice to you- but then he gets angry again.  What that is is not love.  Cheating, abusing, and controlling who you are friends with is the polar opposite of love, even if it might not feel like it.  Be safe, and make the decision to love yourself- and not continue to date a abuser.  "
"HEY!!! I'm learning to love me for being fem because for a long time I tried to hide it, for a man, didn't work out of course. I ended up hating myself and in turn disliking fem guys. How wrong!!! I love being fem! Feels so good to write that, to say it, get it out!! Thank you for your post, I needed that encouragement this morning!"
Some of them. Usually those who cared enough to ask. It's not really the first information I share with people after introducing myself.
"I was gonna make a gay joke, butt fuck it."
"Hey there, please don't talk to me"

Another time, I was playing flag football and I dove for this dude's flag. I instead got a handful of waistband, yanking down both his bottoms. It was obviously more embarrassing for him, but I still felt bad

A couple weeks ago, I was playing basketball and the dude jumped for a layup, as I turned around and reached I got a handful of junk. We both acted like nothing happened

The other day, I was drinking while sitting on a couch with a friend. Then another friend came over and stood in proximity to us. There was enough room for him to sit with us, so I grabbed my friend's leg as a gesture to scoot over, except i ended up grabbing upper inner thigh haha I apologized profusely, but he laughed it off and just leaned his head on me. It was cute and sweet
