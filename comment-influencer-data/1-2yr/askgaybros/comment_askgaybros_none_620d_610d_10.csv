"When I was a kid my dad enrolled me in hockey. I wasn't very good at it, but whatever it was sort of fun. There ended up being a ""Meet Team Canada's Junior League"" contest and my dad entered me in it. The prize was skating around with Team Canada before a game - and then hanging out with them in the locker room.

Crazy thing is I ended up winning, so when the time came we went downtown and I met the team. It was very nerve wracking but skating on the ice with these huge hulking guys was fun. However after the game I was told to join them in the change room. So there is little childhood me walking into the room, only to see the entire Team Canada hockey team sweaty, naked and walking over to say hello.

 I remember their dicks being big and floppy since they just showered, and I was introduced to each naked team member individually. It blew my mind that hot guys just hung around naked like that. 

Then they ate candy with me."
"In middle school I went on a father/son rafting trip with our church. After rafting, we go back to the rafting company‚Äôs locker room to clean up. All us kids were terrified to go in the shower area until the adults were done, especially since our dads were in there. However, my dad is really fast at cleaning up and came out early and told me to go clean up and stop waiting around.

So, I venture in and all the other dads from church are nude and toweling off. Right in front of me, my school football coach and teacher has his foot up on a bench with dick and balls just hanging at eye level a few feet away. It was the best view of a real life penis I had seen at that point in life. It stuck with me so much that when I had him for class the rest of that year I had to keep telling myself to not stare at his crotch. 

Also awkward. I remember staring at a really beefy butt in the shower room too and then realizing it was my pastor‚Äôs."

"when I was like 25, a bi friend from college was visiting my city for work. on his last night here, we went out for drinks and got pretty tipsy since it was a Friday night.

towards the end of the evening, he asked if I wanted to see the skyline view from his hotel room, and I laughed it off saying that I'd rather just keep drinking since I see the view all the time.

didn't realize until the next morning that it was almost definitely an invitation to get me into bed.

we're still friends, but happily involved with other people today. part of me will always wonder what he looks like naked, though."
Whore.
"I mean, if you don't do it, it's basically kink shaming."
"Best friend‚Äôs brother. The bathroom door at their house didn‚Äôt close properly and I was walking by just as he got out of the shower. God bless him, he was absolutely gorgeous. "
"All of the above. 

However. 

We also need to be aware, that LGBT liberation is not *just* about being accepted as ‚Äújust like you‚Äù by straight people. It‚Äôs also about making sure that people are free to be who they want to be - even if the person they want to be is a flaming drag-wearing, power bottom leather bitch boy, high-voiced mincing queen who loves Britney and drama. 

Being gay doesn‚Äôt mean that, but we‚Äôre really selling out if we co-opt all the middle-of-the-road conformity that used to keep us down. If you‚Äôre a middle-American/English/whatever your local equivalent guy or girl who wears a suit and tie and is totally accepted and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and you‚Äôre happy that way because you‚Äôre living your best life, then that‚Äôs great. 

But don‚Äôt forget to use your power as an ‚Äúinsider‚Äù to speak up for all the people who are still outsiders. Being a white cis gay man in a western country with a good family relationship and a rack full of neckties (which is basically me) doesn‚Äôt mean you can join forces with the straights to laugh and make fun of the transgender folk or the dykes in check shirts or the disco queens or the ones who actually don‚Äôt WANT to settle down with a husband, 2.4 adopted refugee kids and a labrador. 

It‚Äôs not all about proving we‚Äôre normal ‚Äúlike them,‚Äù sometimes it‚Äôs about saying ‚Äúfuck normal, open your mind and take us as we are. All of us.‚Äù"

"I was maybe 18 or 19 and flying alone from Denver to San Francisco, and chatted with the very attractive 30-ish gentleman next to me who was on his way to SF via Denver from somewhere east.  I'm pretty sure I was accidentally charming and wonderful, just being my friendly normal self.  He gave me his phone number and asked me to call him while we were both in the city.  As he was leaving I realized he was gorgeous and into me.

I pretty much **immediately forgot that entire interaction** until about a year later when I was getting into my own flirt-and-hookup phase that I had a slam dunk hot-ass one night stand slipped into my pocket and fully whiffed the chance.

Brutal!"
"This is an easy one.  If you can't handle being a convenient mouth for a straight guy, you need to stop sucking his dick.   

I suggest breaking it off with a confidence-boosting ""You're just too sexy and your dick tastes so good that I can't keep sucking you out of fear of becoming addicted to your sweet, straight nut."" "
"I think you should but if you start to feel frustrated by him not coming out, remember you made a choice and don't blame him if he doesn't change.  Just be honest and say.. let's meet again when we don't have HS and parents stopping us."
"College, senior year: He had stuck glow-in-the-dark stars to the ceiling of his room in the house he rented with friends, and he told me I should come back and see them at night to get the full effect. I was hung up on someone else at the time and completely ignored what I later realized was a fairly obvious invitation from a much nicer guy than the one I was hung up on. "
"Went in to a restaurant, gave my name to order and the cute guy taking my order said ""that's a cute name"" and I said ""thanks my parents gave it to me"" before grabbing my food and walking away üôÉ"

He also bought condoms and lube and put them on my bed. Then he went out of his away to tell me what they were for, because I apparently couldn't figure it out...

Him: ""You guys know how to put a condom on, right?""

Me: ""Yes...""

Him: ""Ok just making sure. The lubricant is for your butts. I asked (our doctor) about it and she said to tell them to use lots of lube with the condoms so that you don't tear your butts."" 

Me: ""Ok cool.. whatever... bye...""

Him: ""And don't flush the condoms when you're done, make sure you throw them away in the garbage cause they'll clog up the pipes."" 

Me: YES we know.... goo awayy!""

Do it and give us an update.
"**1)** It was wrong of him to give you an ultimatum/guilt you into reshaping the nature of your relationship.  
  
**2)** You guys only had one sexual encounter.  He hung out with you, enjoyed your company and trusted you for months after the fact.  I find it very unlikely that that was all a ruse to get into your pants, which brings me to point number...  
  
**3)** The vast, vast majority of your relationship was nonsexual.  If he says he's been in love with you, all of that time spent together as friends is what formed that feeling and bond, not one drunken night.  We're gay men after all.  If all we really wanted was just to have sex with someone, it's 100x easier to just troll Grindr for a night than to ""trick"" someone into friendship for half a year.  
  
Point being, yes, he was obviously attracted to you.  But he probably also loved your smile, your laugh, loved talking to you and sharing things with you.  Those are very hard feelings to ignore and suppress, which is why...  
  
**4)**  It might be that a purely platonic relationship is *not* possible.  Being just friends with someone that you are in love with is incredibly painful.  This is especially true when the line has already been blurred once by having sex.  You didn't do anything wrong by experimenting in that moment.  However, it *is* a pretty rare occurrence for a heterosexual man to have the kind of security in oneself to even entertain the idea, and I'm sure it's fueled all kinds of ""what if"" scenarios in your friend's head.  
  
**TLDR:** I would be cautious about the two of you guys getting reinvolved without clear boundaries and understanding of the nature of your friendship.  However, I don't think he was trying to trick or betray you.  People love their friends, not their fuck buddies.  And if he was *in* love with you, he probably cared about you a great deal more than just your dick.

He got himself invited to a few of my friend's social outings. And I just thought he was being friendly. Eventually realized he was gay when I found him on Grindr when we were both home for the holidays. 

Even though he'd been flirting with me since I was 15, it took both of us until we were in college to hook up. I'm glad we eventually did, too... he was excellent. "

"Give him the option to either be with him when he talks to them or to talk to your parents for him. I don't really know what the school is like so I can't tell you whether it would help to go to them or if they'd just single him out more. Maybe there's a bullying or LGBT youth hotline that's local that would have better advice there. If he's copping heat on social media get to him to unfriend or block everyone he doesn't feel good about so the bullying can't follow him home.  
  
Just be in his corner and let him know that he can talk to you and trust you."

"Was with a befriended straight couple and talked about their sex life in (semi) public and they asked me if I met any cute guys lately. Unfortunately I didn't and we continued our conversation. 

A minute later a pretty handsome guy asked if he could join our booth to work in, okay fine. Continued talking, a bit later my friend made a remark along the lines of ""I think there are more really pretty girls then there are really hot guys"" I disagreed with him and then the guy that joined our table said directed at me ""you're certainly one"". I said thanks, but didn't realise he was hitting on me until he left and my friends asked me wtf was wrong with me. 

I think he must have overhead us talking about gay dating stuff, because normally you won't be able to tell I'm gay. I hope I didn't make him feel bad, because I certainly would have been interested had I picked it up at that moment. "
"When he's not really expecting it just tell him to take off all his clothes and stand in the middle of the room, and you stay fully dressed.

The idea is to make him feel vulnerable and sexualized. By keeping yourself fully clothed it makes him feel exposed and out of place.

Basically just look at him and treat him like you're trying to decide if and how you're going to use him for your pleasure.

Say you're hanging out watching TV. Tell him to get up, strip down, and go stand in front of the TV. You stay sitting where you were and look at him like you're inspecting him. If he asks why, say you just want to look at him. Tell him to turn around or bend over and stuff like that. Then get up and walk over to him, but don't touch him yet. Take a long glance at his cock and make sure he sees you do it, then immediately look at his face and nonchalantly ask why he's getting hard, or why he's blushing, or why he looks nervous--something to make him feel a little self conscious. Tell him you'll be right back and not to move, and go chill in the bathroom for a couple minutes. When you walk back into the room stop a few feet away and tell him to walk over to you. When he does, firmly grab his dick/balls for a few seconds--this should be the first time you touch him--and say some cheesy line like, ""well, what are you going to do with this?"" Then have him kneel down like he's going to blow you, and tell him to look in your eyes. Pet his head and maybe push your crotch into his face a bit.

From there you can start having sex.

Or my personal favorite is to suddenly stop, tell him to get stand up and put his clothes on, and just sit back down to watch more TV. Fucking drives me wild when someone does it to me."

"First semester of college my roommate would leave for the weekends. His best friend hated his roommate so he would stay in my room. I had the top bunk and he slept on the bottom. He would wait until he thought I was asleep and jerk off every night. I could feel the bed moving and hear him breathing. He would then go to the bathroom, drop his boxers and stand there totally naked cleaning himself up. There was a full length mirror on the wall and he would stand in full view of it, wiping his stomach off, so I could see the entire thing. Not sure he ever realized I was watching or he could be seen in the reflection. He was a big thick football player type build guy with a short but very thick dick. Perhaps what turned me onto that all these years later. At first it was pretty shocking but after a few weeks it became my weekend nightly ritual to stay awake long enough to witness it. "

"Another story from my parochial school days. When I was in 7th grade there was this real asshole. He was the principal's son and got away with everything. He was a short kid but one of the first to go thru puberty I can remember. Once when I got a hall pass to go to the bathroom I found in already in the bathroom taking a piss. When he finished he turned to me and said ""have you ever seen a dick as big as mine?"" He was double fisting this long fat hairy dick. I remember just staring at it. Then he pushes it out and comes at storming at me like he's going to beat me with it. I backed up to the wall and didn't move (on purpose) he slapped his dick all over my hands and I remember thinking how heavy and warm it was. Then the janitor walked in, yelled at us and we went back to our class rooms. He slapped it on me two more times before the end of the school year.  That was a good year."
"A handsome young man I'd hooked up with before asked me to take pics and video of him that he could attach to his porn studio model application.  His looks certainly qualified him.  He was a stunning young man and I'd yearned to hook up with him again, but I did as requested.  The pics a video took a while; they were good, we chatted and I left.

It later occurred to me that in addition to the application attachments, he was looking for another hookup.  I blew it."
Good Lord. This sounds a fever/wet dream that only the good little gay boys get. 
"Okay, so not that old myself, and it's quite well forgotten by now, but I think Polari (gay secret code language) was pretty cool and it'd be fun to have something like that. I mean, it obviously arose because it was illegal to be a homosexual and fell away when it was no longer needed, so that's good, but I still love the idea of a secret gay code."
"You know what is also very common in the gay community? Body Dysmorphia. I would guess that you are not as unattractive as you think, but even if it were true there are things besides looks that makes people attractive like intelligence, passion, sense of humor. 
My instinct is to ask you for a picture, but a little confidence is what is needed.

So here's some advice based on that we live in a world where you will meet very few people romantically if you don't use some kind of app.

Hang out with some people you are very comfortable with, and do something you are particularly interested in. This will make you less self conscious. 

Figure out a way to get several pictures of yourself throughout. It sounds like it would be good if you had someone else take the photos, and at times when you don't know it's happening.

Same thing goes for writing your bio, and even making contact with people through whatever app you choose. Meaning use it when you are feel particularly good about yourself, and do things that help you feel that way.

Some people are jerks is it more true for gay people than straight people? I don't know I've never been straight. What I do know is you are worth being loved, and that it can happen. You just have to find ways to get yourself to know it too.

tl;dr: I bet you are not as ugly as you say you are, but even if you were there are things that are attractive about you.

"A friend of a friend was going to be staying with me and my housemates for a few days. I'd heard a lot about him, including the fact that he was a bit of a flirt. Pathetic loner that I am, I have a tendency to get crushes on anyone who pays me the slightest attention, so I made a conscious effort not to read too much into it.

He shows up and is just as charming and witty as I'd expected/feared. And despite him not being ""my type"" at all, I'm captivated. At some point, he mentions an old girlfriend. I'm disappointed, but it strengthens my resolve to not misinterpret his flirting. It's hard, though. One night we're watching this lovely french movie about cannibals, and as were joking about a particular scene he ends up sucking on my finger. That's what straight people do with guys they've just met, right? Flirt with them for a few days and then suck on their finger?

A few days later we're alone in a room, chatting about nothing. I say something particularly stupid and he playfully accuses me of flirting with him. I had been so fucking careful to act normal around him, so I'm a tiny bit defensive. When one of my housemates comes back I stupidly declare ""you're friend's been making me terribly uncomfortable."" He looks a little disappointed, but maybe it's just my hopeful imagination. Later that evening as we're all watching a movie together, he tries to put his hand on my thigh. I'm still convinced he's messing with me.

He's slightly less friendly with me during the last few days of his visit. It slowly dawns on me that he might be bi, and that I might be a fucking idiot."

"I went to grad school at the university with a well-known gymnastics program, and one day, after working out in the gym, I happened to hit the showers at the same time as some European gymnastics team who were there for a competition. It was like walking into a room full of naked porn stars. "
"I'm a very vocal bottom. I could be quiet, but I would actively have to try.

When bottoming for a good top, or even just a big dick, it's an *intense* experience. It takes some mental work. Relaxation becomes kind of automatic at some point, but it's still a mental process going on. You need to make sure you're relaxing because something large is stretching out an area that will get fucked up if you tense up. Much of the time you also aren't in control (or at least complete control), so you're reacting to your top. That, for me, is part of it.

It can be like when you rub the head of your dick. It can get really fucking intense and you have to stop or you get overwhelmed. Getting fucked can be like that, except you're riding the edge of that intensity so that you can still handle it without getting overwhelmed, *and* it feels fucking great.

So when you're getting really intense nerve feedback, you're probably at least breathing hard, if not moaning continuously. Now enter the top switching up his game. Now you're not only getting intense feedback from your nerve endings, but you don't know *which nerve endings you'll get feedback from next*. Imagine you're getting a back massage. They're working an area, and it feels great, and they suddenly switch to another area that really needed some work, or dig in when they were being gentle before, but you weren't expecting them to jump to that area suddenly, or dig in at that moment. It feels great, but it's jarring. Now make that way more intense and instead of a massage you have a dick inside you, stretching you out, so you can feel every inch inside you. When you're already highly stimulated, and you get that unexpected *bump* in feeling, it has audible results. On top of the intensity of the prostate, you also have the intense feeling of the dick sliding in and out at the sphincter.

This all being said, if I have a bad top I won't make any noise because they haven't reached the intensity threshold. If they're too small and don't know what they're doing it's boring. If they're too big and don't know what they're doing it can be painful, and I might be making noises, but most won't be the ones you want to hear."

"I went on a date once where the waiter was pretty obviously gay. My date (second date, first meal after coffee type of thing) was more on the feminine side and the waiter immediately started paying extra attention to him, even laid a hand on his shoulder at one point. Near the end of the date, he actually followed my date on Instagram and sent him a message asking if he wanted to get a drink later (my date showed it to me as a like, ""Damn look at this guy""). Never commented on it to the waiter but I thought it was a mix of sleazy and hilarious."

"Currently happening right now. Been talking to a really cute guy on Grindr, we told each other today how much we mutually enjoy talking. Then I realized his name wasn't on his profile, so I asked him for it. He replies:

""Ohhhhhhhhhh this might be awkward. I assumed you recognized me.""

I didn't recognize him, but it turns out he's somebody I was good friends with High School, who came out to me at the time. Earlier he told me that he had a crush on me in high school, but never thought I'd be interested in him. I remember him always wanting to hang out with me and my other friends, which he confirmed was him trying to get in with my friends to be closer with me. Coincidentally, I had a weird half-crush on HIM in high school, but I didn't think HE'D be interested in me. So we must have been awkwardly, blindly dancing around each other's feelings, until we eventually stopped talking.

We have a date planned. Hopefully, we're gonna make up for some lost time. :)"

"good on you for standing your ground.

the whole condoms break thing is hilarious. in the hundreds of times I've had sex, including times with really cheap condoms, never had one break, and I'm not gentle in the least. people just don't use enough lube, or use inappropriate lube.

I think PreP is awesome. I'm still not barebacking. good on you for being the same. "
I was probably 10 playing at neighbors house when the high school brother came out of shower and walked to his room naked. There was a hall mirror that perfectly angled so we could see from our room into his. He toweled off and didn't close his door until he saw us staring.

"You‚Äôre 100% right but honestly from one POC to another it‚Äôs best to try and build up your self confidence to get to a point where it‚Äôs not worth your mental effort.

I still like white guys but I primarily avoid attempting to hook up with or date them because it‚Äôs more likely to be problematic.

There are plenty of men out there who don‚Äôt care about your race or at least are willing to let their guards down. So much of our society is default white so it‚Äôs important that you insulate yourself from messages that want to downplay you for your race.

Also, ignore the ignorant fucks on this site like John2Nhoj or whatever the fuck his name is. Dude has been on this sub for years and he‚Äôs the most miserable fucking queen that I‚Äôve had to deal with. A good example of the trash the gay community produces while hiding behind a screen and keyboard.

Women don‚Äôt want to sleep with bi guys because they don‚Äôt think we are fully into them and are on our way to being gay. 

Gay men think bi guys are just lying to themselves about being gay, OR that dating bi guys is pointless because they‚Äôll ultimately settle down with women. 

You also get a lot of the same discrimination as everyone else who is LGBT.  You will find these bi stereotypes everywhere but find not a lot of willingness to talk about it. I‚Äôm bi and I often don‚Äôt even tell people, because people with good intentions say hateful things. "

"Pretty great! As another commenter said, it requires work and LOTS if open communication, but we have been on the same page with all of our recent decisions lately (two new jobs, selling/buying houses, choosing which new city to live in, starting the adoption process). The biggest thing for us is to share regularly with each other: hopes, fears, annoyances, anger, and love. We let each other know if something comes up (even if it is purely and admittedly irrational) before it becomes an issue. We can't expect the other to be a mind reader, so we make sure to say ""Hey babe. When you said/did x, I interpreted it as y. I'm pretty sure/nearly positive you meant z, but can we discuss why I thought y and you said x?"". For both of us, our open trust and communication is the Crux of our marriage: nothing is a fight between us, it is a joint effort against an issue that has arisen.

For context: been together 6 years, married 2. I'm 29, he's 37."

"Thank you for sharing your experience.

I'm under the impression that HPV transfers via skin-to-skin contact. It's therefore not inhibited by localized condoms. The same rules apply to HSV. Besides vaccinating (and abstinence) what does safe sex mean with regard to HPV mean to you?

Secondly, please note, I'm not trying to stir up shit, but... well... perhaps you should be reconsidering your 'crushing guilt'.

It sounds like your awesome boyfriend (and he truly sounds wonderfully supportive) had numerous past partners. You had one. I've been told that 90% of adults have some strain of HPV - many non-symptomatic. And that if you have more than 1 sexual partner you've got some form of it essentially. Your boyfriend had some strains of HPV, if asymptomatic, before you two got together, statistically. Moreover, the warts didn't appear until a year plus into your committed relationship, but usually they would appear after 1 to 3 months according to the Internet. It's quite possible you did not contract the anal warts from the stranger who took your virginity. I'm not trying to flip the script on your boyfriend - and there's no one way to determine it anyhow - but it's more likely you got infected from him. And that you were more susceptible to symptoms than he was. 

I don't say this for you to flip out and blame him or anything terrible. But maybe ease off with the self-blame. Be there for your boyfriend like he's been there for you. He didn't value you less, don't value him less. And don't kill yourself over bumps. Don't value yourself less.

first, it was a church father/son trip, so i'm sure that there wasn't a fear of the kids ""catching"" the gay from seeing their dad's naked. second, this may also have been before it was such a huge deal to be naked in a locker room. when i was in school, we were required to dress and shower for gym. everyone had to. no exceptions. now i hear that showering is ""optional"" and that almost no one does it. i realize that there are a lot more cameras and assholes take pictures but still, imo it's not that big of a deal."

"I moved to a new town my seventh grade year. I had trouble making friends at my school, so I joined a youth writers group for kids from all over the area. 
One older guy from the group really liked my poems and invited me to his house to write songs and hang. We stayed up all night and I fell asleep next to him on his bed. 
When I woke up, he was under the covers and I was on top and freezing. I took off my pants and got under the covers with him. He woke up a little as I slipped into the sheets and I said, ""do you mind, it's kinda cold"". He didn't say anything but he pulled my polo shirt off, wrapped his arms around me and spooned me for the rest of the night. I was very shocked and very aroused.  It took me about ten minutes to regain my senses enough to notice that he was completely naked and that his cock was pressed against my lower back. 
When I woke up, he was awake and still holding me and we stayed like that talking for a long time. It was intimate and sexy...but it wasn't about sex. We were friends until he went to college and we slept that way often over the years, but it never went beyond kissing. I miss him.

"It sounds simple. It sounds so easy. But it isn't, and here is why. 

You two are seeking similar results. 

You two are on same routine, going together, living together, eating together and so on. So it would follow that the results would be the same right? Enter Genetics. 

Your challenge is to realize that you are not in competition with him, you are in competition with your body goals. 

This is going to be a real challenge for you, but if you really work at perspective you can do this. 

It is great that he is making great progress, but it doesn't affect what you are doing at all. You would continue to eat what you eat, exercise how you are currently exercising, and continuing your regimen for obtaining strength and physique...right? 


Well.. sorta. 

When guys get deep into training, they often visualize their results. They focus on a narrow expectation that they will be _________. 

Some guys, it's ""get swole to get girls"". 

For you, what was your image of success?

This is important because right now you feel like he is beating you to it. 

He isn't. 

He can't. 

The only way he can beat you to your goals is if he were able to make your body get insane progress. 

NOW....it is neat that you share a hobby, it is great that you enjoy it....and it will keep you guys fit, so stop competing with him and compete with yourself. Identify your goals. Identify why you do this. Figure out how to get a little bit closer to your goals. 

Do you lift because it will get you sexual attention? More attention from boys? More of this or that? 

These are the questions you need to ask yourself to get to the root of your feelings. Be careful, this is big boy stuff, you have to learn not to compete with him in this way. It isn't healthy to view him as winning and you as loosing. Get your goals straight. Review your imagery, figure out why you wanna be swole. That will help you make your peace and get ready to compete with your own body. 

Good Luck"

"I went to an all-male boarding school in the 1980s. It was shocking NOT to see accidental nudity on a daily basis.

* Went swimming in the school pool on a weekend. Hardbody gym teacher came in with his infant son, got nude, changed into his bathing suit right at side of pool.

* Every morning, guys would be in the bathroom showers, most sporting morning wood or severely chubbed up. Looked like a scene from a Falcon porno.

* Guys used to walk around nude like it was a nudist resort.

* Showered beside various teachers, most pretty athletic, muscle dad types. Mastered the side glance and memorized their dicks LOL.

* No locks on doors so you were always walking in on guys jacking off. Most hid it pretty well but once I walked in on a guy cumming into his hand.

Also:

* In the 1970s, I still remember going for squash/tennis lessons at a big sports club outside the city that also had huge sporting fields, and then walking into the locker room after a rugby game. So much male flesh and cock, it would make you head explode. Back then I was only like 11 so I wasn't consciously turned on by sexual imagery, but I knew I liked what I saw.

* Stayed the night at a hunky friend's house, sleeping side by side in twin beds. I woke up in the morning and saw him with the covers half off, his rock-hard dick jutting out of his boxers, totally asleep. I just stared and stared."

"I'm a teacher in the UK. Without giving too much away, the demographics of the students I teach mean that there most certainly is a lot of homophobia. 

If I ever detect it in the classroom or on school grounds, I always challenge it for example once I had a picture of a model on my powerpoint and one of the boys said ""he's really good looking"". I was actually surprised he was confident enough to say that. You can imagine how other students reacted. I just said ""Yes he is handsome isn't he?"" And I asked why others called the student gay for his comment and we discussed that why being an LGBT person is fine and noticing someone is handsome etc. doesn't indicate their sexuality all the time.

Next year I'm actually planning on arranging for an organisation do to a assembly/presentation on LGBT issues . I just feel like someone needs to do something about it because there is no discussion on it at all.

"I worked at a hotel in college and wasn't out (or active) and didn't even realize guys would be into really thin guys.

So, this regular business traveler that I always thought was handsome had a package delivered to the hotel. When he came in that night, I told him and he asked if I could instead bring it up to his room later. He called down after midnight and said now was a good time. When I knocked on his door, he opened it only wearing a towel. In my dumb head, I was thinking that I was just lucky for the chance to see this favorite customer's fuzzy chest. 

He asked me to set the package on a desk in the back of his room, so the door ended up closing behind me and everything. I was just on autopilot of trying to set it down and leave without it looking like I was staring at him too much. He even stalled and asked if I could wait while he got a tip for me. Ended up just taking the tip and leaving.

In my head, I was used to the dorms where guys would just be in towels around other dudes all the time without thinking anything of it. So, I just thought he thought we were bros. Now as a guy in my 30s near his age, I realize that I wouldn't just call down and have a guy come up at the exact time I'm in a towel when it would be easy to throw on a shirt or robe. I don't know exactly what he wanted to happen, but I'm pretty sure he was testing the waters when I replay it in my head now."

You need a priority list. This is basic, covers needs for the next 24 hrs. You need Food and shelter. This time of year it is cold in most places, so you need to contact local churches, explain you have been kicked out, and ask if they can help you with a warm place to stay for a week. 

You are going to need money for clothes and food and a cell phone. Does anyone owe you? Do you have someone you can call that will give/loan you some money? A distant relative perhaps?

This is local to London, but they can help you find help where you are if in the UK

If you are somewhere else spend five minutes figuring out how to get some help by calling LGBT hotlines.

"I'm sure there are anecdotal exceptions, but for the most part people with no pic have no pic because they're kinda fugly and they know it.  I've tried playing the lottery a few times but in each case, after they sent a pic, I was like ""oh THATS why... """
"Some possible explanations include the tastes of the type of guys who make gay porn, the type of guys who consume gay porn, selecting models with the widest possible appeal, and the fact that porn tastes do not necessarily reflect ""real life"" tastes.

What I like in porn (e.g. slutty girls) does not necessarily equate to what I like in actual people."
Just because you don't know a lot of gay guys doesn't mean the first one you connect with is the one you're meant to be with
Thanks for the advice. It's hard to see him go through this. I just can't understand the mentality that would make people do this to a nice kid. 
"I met my boyfriend on OkCupid. Most guys on there seemed like they were looking for something more serious. It seems like a really lame app but I met the love of my life there so ,^_^"
Did that too!

"I reeaaallly doubt that was supposed to be flirting. Probably just him having fun with his business. Maybe if he had said something like you look like an angel so you must have the voice of one I would agree, but with the current comment, you would be hard-pressed to make a claim of flirtatious activity taking place."

"I think this is what I'll do. I hope it works out but if it doesn't we should be adult about it and perhaps, as you say, we could get together when we are free from our current restraints."
"""*Why do gays only go for fit and muscular guys! They're all so shallow!""

""Well, what kind of guys are you into?""

""Fit and muscular guys, but that is besides the point. They should give me a chance.""

"I know what you're talking about. It's called ""fucked silly"" or ""getting your brains fucked out,"" something like that. Can't walk straight, knees are weak, legs are like jelly, can't talk proper and you're panting and shaking and sweating all over.

"I've seen people do it. One guy I follow on Instagram has a wishlist and people just buy stuff for him. He posted a letter from one of his slaves too. I'm a little uneasy as it feels like some people might be exploited, but I guess people should use their own money for their enjoyment, and if that enjoyment is buying stuff for other people then fine."
"He helped me with my laundry after sex. It was the first time we met. 

Suffice to say, it was a good absurd. "

Don't do it :(
"When will we have an OPENLY gay president? Probably not for quite some time. However, I find it difficult to believe that out of 45 guys, there hasn't been at least one who secretly had same-sex desires."
"you've only been seeing each other a month? he doesn't feel you're exclusive.

it's just a month, so you can probably choose to move on if you wish."
I feel like we are all apart of a study that we didn't sign up for 
"Well this has been a long time coming lol. But that fast is too fast. 

The guy is extremely nice. He and I work out together sometimes. We were drinking some beer watching stand up and it happened. He's also extremely good looking."
