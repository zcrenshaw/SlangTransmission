"The average age here is probably about 18, which has a lot to do with it.  Black and white thinking is very common with youth.

"The more time I've spent on AGB, the more I've seen a pretty clear dichotomy between two variant experiences based on where people happen to fall along the masc-fem spectrum that lead to similar but opposite results. For a lot of the guys who are on the more fem end of the spectrum, they generally grow up being a lot more ""obvious."" Many of them took their licks for being gay before they even realized they liked guys--their femininity made them a target for a heteronormative world that had no place for them. To make it, these guys had two options--embrace themselves or learn to fake a masc role for survival. Upon coming out, those who were faking it often become more at peace expressing their genuine self, but sometimes they stay stuck in it out of a feeling that they need to prove something about being simultaneously gay and masculine. For the guys who had this experience, it's easy to assume it's the same for everyone, and that the ""masc"" guys are still just in their survival/shame mode.

For the guys who found themselves on the opposite end of that spectrum, naturally leaning towards more masc behaviors, they were able to get away with having a natural place in the world of most men until puberty, when they started realizing they weren't having the feelings towards women that their buddies were. Hiding or denying becomes easy when nobody is looking at the way you appear, speak, and behave and immediately calling you gay for it. Because they are effectively indistinguishable from the average straight guy, these masc boys often have no idea how to spot the other guys like them. The only gay guys they can see are the ""visible"" ones, the fem ones, which leads to them feeling insecure about having a gay identity (as they're more likely to feel ""is that what I have to be like if I'm gay?"") Sometimes when these guys come out, they end up trying on the more ""visible"" gay identity because they've never been able to conceptualize of being gay and masculine simultaneously, or because they don't know how else to advertise themselves as gay to potential partners. Eventually they get tired of faking this role and give up on it. From their experience, the guys who are ""fem"" are the ones who are faking it to stand out and signal others. This can have the effect of creating resentment when the masc guys feel as though the ""fem fakers"" are creating false expectations for others about what a gay man is like.

Effectively, both extremes of this spectrum have probably felt some pressure to behave more like those on the other end of the spectrum, which leads to resentment, frustration, and alienation on both sides. 

Not all gay men will feel you are putting on an act, and the ones who do likely either feel that way because that was they've seen others do it/done it themselves and can't think outside of that; or because they genuinely feel you *are* putting on an act (idk if that's the case or not, I don't know you at all). 

Generally, I find that a lot of gay men fall more in the middle of the spectrum than on an extreme at either end. They have masc qualities and tastes and fem qualities and tastes. 

I'd say you should probably just continue to behave in ways that are authentic to *you*, no matter what they may be. As long as you treat others with kindness and respect, people will generally treat you well, even if they don't have a lot of commonality with you. And beyond that, a lot of people will have common tastes with you that you may never even realize. Some of the most fem twinks I know are also some of the most hardcore gamers I know--not necessarily ""masc"" in the way that cars and guns and sports are, but still, they have interests beyond fashion and makeup and drag and pop starlets. And I know there are plenty of gay men here who will work on their engine while blasting Britney. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. "

They came back a few hours ago and I did say 'I suppose you don't need me to tell you that I'm gay' and all my mother said was that I should've told her before and then I wouldn't have had so many years of her asking when I'm getting a girlfriend

"Personal anecdote here, maybe helps explain some of the data?

I like to watch ""straight guy"" porn - but it's not because they're straight. In fact, I tend to believe very few of them are. No, I watch ""straight guy"" porn because it seems to do a better job of balancing:

- masculine actors (no offense to the femmes; it's just not what I'm looking for)
- a little more story (if a porno opens up with a shot of an asshole with a dick already in it, I get nothing out of it; I need some plot)
- a little more interpersonal tension (not like a rape fantasy or anything, but I want to see someone kind of take the lead and convince the other guy everything is going to be alright)

Given these features, it's hard to beat the ""straight guy"" videos. I don't care if you're black, Asian, cut or uncut, a twink or a jock - what I want is masculinity, plot, and a leader/follower dynamic. That's what brings me to ""straight guy"" porn. "

"Kinda different living situation; I'm in a house, but the same kinda scenario. I live with multiple people, but one girl in particular who has a boyfriend, who virtually lives at my house despite having his own home which is fully subsidized by his parents (he is an only child living with his parents) unlike my own. 

Despite the fact that he literally lives 2 streets away from me, they insist on being at our house all the time. However the other day I was laying on the lounge just scrolling through my Instagram and a shirtless photo of a guy popped through (Kyle Krieger if you're interested). She immediately made a comment about how all I do is obsess over guys and that I need to find something else to do with my time (which similar to you is totally bullshit). 

This happens time and time again and she's somewhat opinionated and I usually just let it slide because honestly I don't want to deal with the argument. However, I snapped. I told her if she wants to bring another person into our house 24/7, that she either needs to be understanding that I can do what I want, whether it be having a revolving front door of hookups, or me scrolling through my Instagram which happens to have a male on it. She tried to snap back and tell me it's different because I'm gay, and that conversation was *very quickly* shut down. I told her she either needs to go to her boyfriend's house more or tolerate what I do.

She finally worked out that I have just as much right to the house and she does and she hasn't said a word since. She might not like it, but at least I don't have to hear her whine about it."

"You need to make sure he knows he can talk to you about anything, that you love him and are there to support him etc - it's vital that he sees you as an understanding person to share his problems with rather than someone to hide them from. Obviously it's important that he knows he can't lash out like that, but I wouldn't respond by simply punishing him, he needs to know that you understand where his anger is coming from.

Boys are significantly more likely to externalise depression and anxiety with disruptive behaviour and aggression - it may be a good idea to find a councillor who is experienced with LGBT issues.  They can help teach him how to deal with what he's going through, and help him to mentally rebuff the negative things he's hearing about being gay.      
Have you spoken to his school about it? They may have people in the school who are trained to deal with LGBT bullying, people he can talk to. If they understand where this behaviour is coming from, they should also take a different approach to dealing with it.

It's also important that he knows that it really does get *so much better*. For many gay kids (myself included) school can be some of the shittiest years of your life.  I remember hating the fact that I was gay, feeling like i'd be unhappy with it forever - the homophobia he experiences now will definitely subside; people mature and change their attitudes. School can be a stupid, toxic little fish bowl and is no way representative of normal life, but when you're there it doesn't feel like that at all.

There are loads of resources online on how to deal with homophobic bullying as a parent, maybe [take a read](https://nobullying.com/a-parents-guide-to-protecting-their-children-from-lgbt-bullying/) of some of these."
"It's rare that anyone lets one aspect of their cultural identity define and inform every aspect of their life. For example: Do you let being a  New Yorker define every aspect of your life? Do you let being a Catholic inform every part of your life? Do you let your Irish heritage define every aspect of your life? Do you let your maleness define every aspect of your life? etc.

People are more aware of what they're not doing than what they are. There also seems to be an unnecessary conflation of stereotypes with identity, like there isn't one way to be gay you can be gay without rainbow tights, pride rallies, casual sex etc seems like you let those completely define it for you and then feel alienated from the label as a result. Put your own stamp on it.

To answer the question: I consider being gay a core part of my identity in the same way being a man, being white, having a disability and being a quiet/thoughtful person are."

"As a gay guy that was severely bullied at school I can give you one important piece of advice, SUPPORT your son. I know he punched a kid, and punching has consequences, but he was right to punch the kid, because he was defending himself.

I was severely bullied at school for being gay and N-O-B-O-D-Y came to my defense. The consequences of not receiving support?  Besides chronic depression I have mental illnesses, I am on meds, I suffer from phobias, extreme fears, I even had a time after leaving school were I could hear ALL days homophobic slurs, even though they were not real. I could be on my bed and I could hear insults and homophobic slurs like hearing a radio. 

That happened when I had 14-17 years old and I am now 27. And I still blame my parents for not acting, for not standing up for me, and we still have fights because of that. They complain I'm not a functional individual and I blame them for not stoping the episode that changed my brain forever.  Please defend your son, this bond you have with him will be a bond until either one of you dies, but the school will eventually finish and it's not worthy to ignore your son's feeling because straight people are majority. The school that will fade away from your life eventually, but your son will be with you until either one of you dies. Remember that. Defend what's yours. Don't ignore harassment or bullying, I know my case was extreme but look at the consequences 10 years later. My life continues to be half ruined.  

Defend your son. Show him you love and support him no matter what orientation he has, because he didn't choose that lifestyle I can bet on that. After what I lived in school I wished I was straight to just calm the rumors, if it were a choice thing, I would have chosen to have a girlfriend. But I just couldn't. I don't like women and I don't like to lie emotionally to anybody. If it were a choice, nobody will choose to be subject of harrasement. Who will choose to be a second-class citizen that cannot marry the same sex in virtually 80% of the countries in the world? Who will choose to be murdered(Islamic Countries) by their own judicial branch of government?  Nobody chooses to be gay, because being gay is very difficult, especially at the beginning. "

Again, based on the information you gave, my guess is that he is a friendly man and he doesn't mind your sexual orientation.

My parents said no, then I saw a girl and her dad buying it and I asked them why she can have it and not me, they said"" because it's for girls"" and I didn't understand it and still don't. It was advertised to girls but nothing on there said ""for girls only"". 

Cut to 10 years later and I got one to fulfill the gaping hole in my heart and the stuff you can make with it sucks ass, kinda glad my parents didn't waste their money on it haha"
"I don't get this attitude at all.
Like, people always say ""whats too much to share to straight friends?"" ""Is it ok to talk to my friends about...""

I'm the only bi guy in my group of friends and I feel empowered and accepted when they get curious about details. It's curiosity which is the end product of normalization.

That curiosity is a lot better than fear or preternatural resentment."

"Had a crush on this guy in my dorm whose ass looked like two basketballs.

I was walking out the door as he was walking in and he basically burped in my face as I passed him.

"Yes.  I was an absolute shithead in my late teens and early 20s especially to femme guys.  I would verbally gay bash guys doing PDA and terrorize femme guys in public by scaring the shit out of them thinking I was gonna smash their faces in.

All rooted in pathetic insecurity and self-hatred.  "
"From my experience, a straight guy asking a gay guy who isn't their close friend to go to a full body massage parlor is a sign that he is really curious and trying to explore. I had a ""straight"" guy take me all the way to Miami to be his ""trial boyfriend"" away from everyone we know and it all started with an invite to the massage parlor. This is an extreme case of course but there are other instances where ""wanna give me a massage?"" or "" wanna go to the massage parlor?"" is code for ""I wanna try gay stuffs""

If you do do it just remember that you're shitting where you're eating and theres a chance that it will mean nothing for him the second he nuts, or he only chose you bc you're the only experienced person available to try this out with. Whatever it is just make sure that you are mature and strong enough to still see him everyday normally, should things go south during or after the ordeal. "

"My father found out I was gay when he caught me jerking off in a similar situation.  He threw over a chair in rage and just walked away. To my surprise he never mentioned it. When I finally mustered up the courage to walk into the living room and face him, he just pretended like it never happened.  To this day we've never talked about me being gay. The good thing that came of it is he stopped bothering me with questions about when I was going to find a girlfriend."

I think she is overblowing the ""danger"" you put them/their house in, but it seems like you caved to that and there is no going back. 

Don't let them tell you under what rules you can have sex. You're an adult, it's your body. But, if they ask you not to fuck in their house, that is their right. 

Good luck. You got off better than some ultra conservative family gay boys for sure. "

"I wonder if being gay is really such a tiny part of your life? The way some people feel the need to stress this constantly indicates otherwise. Maybe you fear the judgement of some straight people, and you feel the need to say this in order to fit in. Maybe it *is* an important part of you. That's not a bad thing."
"One time I was bored and got on Grindr while waiting for a flight and less than 20 minutes later I was getting my cum swallowed by a model-core, athletic Chinese guy in a bathroom.

"Speaking as a guy who has dealt with HIV for 29 years, who lost 2 partners, one to AIDS-related illness and the other to an accidental opioid overdose, who buried most of his gay friends in the 80's &amp; 90's, and who also has back issues and two artificial hips due to protease inhibitors causing osteonecrosis, I can tell you that you are going to have to toughen up if you want to get through life. None of us, short of being Einstein or Galileo, are interesting or important to everyone. The best we can hope for is to matter to those we care about.  

So you aren't interesting. You can be something else just as valuable: nice. When someone wears a cool shirt or dress, compliment them. Help people unload their cars for no reason. Learn to cook or bake and make something for your SO or parents. Life is hard for most of us. It's our job to help us all get through it. Focus on making life good for someone else. You'll be surprised how fulfilling it can be."
"I ended up in a room with lots of noisy kids for about an hour today and thought to myself, ""I am so glad to be gay."""
Intelligence. Beauty is fleating
"It's been going for at least 100 years as a gay-specific thing and was the most obviously illegal of the gay things people wanted to do (someone could look for sex in a public toilet somewhat discreetly but you couldn't dress as a woman discreetly).  There were even laws around the times of mafia-run gay bars in the 60s mandating people having to wear at least 4 articles of gender appropriate clothing.  Because of that, they were quite prominent in the underground gay scene and I think the tradition deserves a place and respect, even if you wouldn't want to date one.  Not to mention many drag shows are very entertaining (they vary in quality, of course)."
It seems like when I meet a guy who I'm physically attracted to he's a total tool and when I'm feeling connected to a guy I have no sexual feelings whatsoever.

"went on one date with a guy, he brought 2 friends along. barely gave me eye contact and talked very little to me Then he went to dance and made fun of my dance moves. After the date, I said we could be friends if we want, but not date. See him 4 months later at a gay bar that I went to alone just to blow off steam after work, and he ripped into me as to why flakiness is why gay men are all alone and have no friends. then said i look anorexic and like i have aids. mind you i am trying very hard to gain weight. total dick and I avoid that kind of drama. "
I dont like it when straight people ask. But I dont mind if a gay asks
"Maybe it was genuine homophobia.  Maybe they were about to go to the back to get high, and couldn't while you were there.  Maybe they'd have reacted the same way to a straight couple.  It was rude, and very poor customer service, and the manager should know.  If that was the manager, the regional manager should know.



I mean, obviously, I react pretty aggressively to actual, clear-cut, could-be-nothing-but homophobia.  But this isn't quite blatant enough for me to get aggressive about it.

"1. That I have an underwear obsession. I would drive to 5 different store locations of the same company (discount store) the same day just to buy out all the good name brand underwear. It's basically a here today, gone tomorrow thing. I have 34 boxes of unopened Calvin Klein underwear in my closest. I also have 18 unopened boxes of UA jockstraps as well. In addition, 2 stuffed drawers and 2 large storage bins full of designer underwear. I buy underwear impulsively a lot even if I don't have a lot of money. It's my guilty pleasure. If my parents found out about this they would think I'm a freak or mentally ill lol

2. I have bought vacuum sealed cum/sweat/public hair soaked briefs and boxer briefs from hot older men online. They were complete strangers from the other side of the U.S. The idea of buying from them was hot but, I felt dirty and disgusted by the smell and the fact that I don't know if these guys have STDs so I just threw them away despite spending a lot of money on the orders. Better safe than sorry.

3. Obviously, that I am gay. Although accepting of other people, My parents are still too traditional when it comes to family and me being gay would not be ok. 

4. That I plan to move away far once I have my career and start living my life with the man of my dreams in a new state, new city, and that I'll make new friends who will accept the real me.

5. That although I'm quite liberal and non-white, I love camo design on clothing or accessories. I love country music and culture. I love conservative and country guys and older men. Their just something about there masculinity, respectful mannerisms, work ethic, charm and humor that I love."

"This happened last night and is still ongoing kind of, but here goes:

He was supposed to move back to the US when his school's over next month, but on a whim decided to change his plans and stay in Sweden for the next who knows how long. I got pissed off and basically gave him the ultimatum of moving back here or ending the relationship. I still haven't heard back, so we probably just broke up.

"My rule with straight guys is that they have to make the first move, and it has to be very straightforward. Like a kiss or a hand on my dick. A straight friend in high school asked if I'd give him a blowjob and I was like yeah whatever. He pressed and I told him if he was serious to whip it out. He pulled down his shorts and his hard cock is tucked into the waist band of his underwear that he just pulled down. I want indisputable proof their serious. 

Even if you get that you work with this guy and it could make things super awkward. I've known straightish guys that like having someone to fool around with and they're  cool. Other guys can even get mean. 

Just be careful."

When I asked the obvious question, he swore he never put his dick in the calf's mouth, but from the way it felt on my own finger, I know he was lying. That calf would have been blowing me until he was a bull."

"So, fake account because I'm embarrassed, we got together when I was 21 and he was 19, we had talked about cheating, he said he wouldn't be able to handle it (this was probably two weeks after being together as boyfriends) a year after our first anniversary the honeymoon ended and things were really serious, I was okay with it but I was telling that we were going to last a LONG time so I guess a part of me got scared? We also never argued, one of the reasons why I liked him in the first place was because he is always so nice and polite with everyone, never argues and always tries to resolve issues in a polite talk, one night I got DRUNK, really drunk, and this cute guy was flirting with me, next thing I know, we were making out and then SEX! Now this guy wasn't just a random guy, it ended up being some friend from my boyfriend's friend, he was gonna tell everyone if I didn't confess (not really know if  this is true but this guy didn't know were still together, he thought we had broken up at some point) he wanted me to confess because my bf ""is a really nice person and feels bad about the whole thing"", I confessed two days later, my bf flipped out, he cried, a lot, that was the first (and only) time I have seen him cry, he called me every name in the book, and didn't talk to me for about two weeks, I tried to reach him every single way, no response, after those two weeks he came to me and said that we could try to go through this, what did I do gain his trust again? This is a weird concept, our relationship was never the same after this, he doesn't get mad if i go out or get drunk but I can tell he gets uncomfortable, before the cheating he used to have me as his wallpaper on his phone, now he only has his friends or his dogs, his friends never got over me betraying him, when people ask him ""what would you do if you and him broke up"" before the cheating his answers would be things like ""yeah that's never happening"" now his answers are ""move on I guess?, I would get a dog"" he says it an playful way, but I know it's true, it has been five years since the cheating, we are engaged and living together, he is still the most  nicest and loving person in the world, and he treats me as his prince, I know  I won't be getting a second chance, and  that some things are never going to be the same, but I'm still happy we have  been able to get over this, getting married next spring.

The thing with these cases is that they will provide the cake, just not custom decorate it in a fashion that they disagree with. The last bakery that did this offered them any cake in the store, even wedding cakes that were pre-decorated, they just didn't want to create a custom cake for an event that they didn't agree with. 

And honestly, that is fine. 

I don't want to live in a country where we *force* people to express themselves creatively in support of a cause that they don't support.

Two days later he blocks me on app and my phone number, never felt so cheated and used like this before since we really clicked and I thought we could be at least friends with benefits.
