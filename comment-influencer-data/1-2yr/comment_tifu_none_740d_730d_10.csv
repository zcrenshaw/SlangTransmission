Congratulations. You are now intellectually disabled. Keep the box ticked. 
You didn't at least wipe it off? Come on dude.. that's cover your ass 101
"OP go get a tetanus shot if you haven't had one in the last five years (or if you can't remember when your last one was).  Clostridium tetani lives in soil and ain't no joke.

---

Edit:  Everyone trying to correct me by saying it's 10 years... you're *wrong*.  It's recommended to receive a regular tetanus vaccination every 10 years for normal people who haven't suffered any sort of dirty/penetrating injury.  If you *have suffered such an injury* there are guidelines that recommend revaccinating if your shot was &gt;5 years ago, or if you can't remember when it was.

Source: I work in a fucking ER.  Oh yeah... also [some fucking guidelines](http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/tetanus/hcp/tetwdmgmtc.pdf).  Tetanus shots are cheap, have a low risk of side effects, and the risks of being wrong are huge.  OP needs to go get a shot."
Just delete facebook. You'll thank me later. 
Why would you want to announce that you have ADHD on a job application? That sounds like a great way to not get a reply.
i would have easily threw the entire appliance out
The moose out front should've told you.
"My mother once told an employer she considered herself ""visible minority"" because she's tall. 


She later told me the employer looked perplexed and I explained that it has to be like a characteristic people would discriminate against. She said a bunch of girls teased her back in school. Aight mom, I respect your journey..."
"you have to assert dominance. next time you see them, start masturbating in front of them"
"If you stomp on one of those spiky balls everyday you'll soon develop a resistance to maces, flails, and morningstars. Half damage yo."
Didn't heed OP's advice: shat myself in India and didn't sit next to Molly :(
"So in case there is a shooter, the plan is to have everyone get in a centralized area and stand in a mob. Got it."
Congratulations.  You've just given your boyfriend all the psychosexual fuel he'll need to nourish his new fetish.
"Dude if this is all real then I seriously give you props. The pain must suck, but the fact you had the courage to stand up to those bastards is what counts, and I'm sure SB won't ever forget that. Did any members of the public try to help out? What happened after they left? Surely there must have been some CCTV they can use to charge those guys for assault."

Excuse me? "
"Fuck man, Now you got me worried, My foot has been throbbing for like 6 hours now. I'm going to take your advice Kinolee thank you"
"You're going to be ok.

First, explain to your boss that you had a medical emergency. If he continues to press you for an answer, explain that you had an infection that ruptured. Don't mention puss or anything gross, try to kept it sounding as medical as possible. Web MD that shit if you need to come up with a way to describe it.

Secondly, if your girl loves you, she's just gonna laugh her ass off at you. It's embarrassing, but you'll be able to (eventually) look back at this and laugh. Who knows, maybe your relationship will grow from this traumatic experience.

Thirdly, I'm no doctor, but I do watch a lot of Dr. Pimplepopper. You probably want to have that checked out if it smelled that bad. They may need to properly remove parts of it so it doesn't grow back again.

Take a moment, breathe, and then go clean up the mess. I would use gloves but that's just me. Feel better and have a laugh about it tomorrow. "
"Why yes, yes you did! I wanted to eat healthier, maybe it was the wish come true, my small intestines now absorbing every bit of nutrients those little protein packed grub delicacies have to offer. The silver lining to eating maggots! "
"I agree. Don't disclose this to anyone you don't have to. Only your doctor and your spouse or partner need to know.
"
Nuke it from orbit. Only way to be sure.
"That's was disgusting but I could not stop fucking reading.

How did you get it all over that?! I thought it was fine in the bathroom?!

I have no advice. I have no witty jokes. I'm broken by this, wiped at the emotional rollercoaster.

Please do update with how you explain this to your boss and the outcome...good luck."
"Well done, you may have been hit but you still helped the guy. "
A friend will warn you not to eat street food; a true friend will help you clean up after you shit yourself after ignoring your friend's warning.

"For realz tho. If you are in the US, there is absolutely nothing that would require you to disclose a disability when applying for jobs (unless it would actually prevent you from doing it).

Today Was Awesome: Tricked my kids into leaving me alone for 7 hrs.
Thanks for the kind words. And yes a few people instantly came to me. One of them I'm assuming had medical practice because he was asking if I was dizzy etc. But with the London TFL you really don't want to go through the hassle of getting CCTV footage...
"Haha I'm 6' myself, and my husband is 5'6"". People stare. I like to joke that there should be a term for this, like ""inter-height marriage"", because it definitely feels like we're defying some kind of social norm."
"Not to one up you but never ever ever open a fridge someone dumps in the woods. My wife and I did thinking we would find a body or something. No body. It was however filled with a shload of meat ,and lunchables oddly. We stood there watching​ a writhing mass of thousands of beetles eating all this grey blue meat. Not the hotdogs though. They were untouched. That's when the smell finally came back down to earth with a vengance. Wife starts gagging instantly and runs back to the car. She's gagging the entire time. I'm laughing at this point and then the smell hits me. Now i am laughing uncontrollably  and gagging in the same instant. I tried running down hill but the smell followed me. It was everywhere. It took about ten minutes of driving to air out the car ,and another two of breathing clean air to stop the nausea. We learned a very stupid lesson that day.  "

Don't be embarrassed.  She probably was just taken off-guard by the gesture.  Or maybe something else (like stressful day at work) prevented her from reacting positively.  This is a victory for you.  You were brave enough to put yourself out there.  Be proud.  If she contacts you - extra bonus.  :D

Hey OP. I would have given almost anything to have someone stand up when I was getting kicked (literally) around. You're a hero man. You don't need to hurt someone to save another person. Just show that you're not afraid to stand up and show what a proper human can do. Thank you bud.

"I knew this guy in high school who's father owned an abandoned farm. His dad just up and left the house and never went back and never took anything out of the house. One night when we were all drinking and messing around we got to talking about the house and how it had been empty for SEVEN years and got the awesome idea to go and check it out. We were all messing around when this dude opens the deep freezer. It was full of butterball turkeys. Seven. year. old. thawed. turkeys. that had been sealed in a freezer. I have never seen so many people simultaneously vomit. We ran out of there so fast and people were still puking out of the car and dry heaving hours later. 

As an ICU nurse, I've smelled some of the worst smells out there, yet to this day, the turkeys are on another level. I gag writing this 20 years later. There was this one guy who years later would still gag when you said ""turkeys"". Shit.....those turkeys. "

"Yup the buses in India don't have toilets. I was surprised to know that in some countries they have. I definitely avoid buses for journeys more than 2-3 hours.

"I've been there.

In high school, sophomore year, in health class. I had a huge pimple on my back in a weird spot I could not reach. We were doing a test and I leaned back against my chair when I finished then slid down a little in a slouched position. Sliding down caused the pimple to pop when it was pressed against the top of the chair and squeezed like a tube of toothpaste.

I could feel the blood running down my back so I asked to be excused. I was just going to wipe it off and change my shirt. On the way out the teacher saw the bloodstain then followed me into the hallway. He asked to see the spot, he would also help in the nurses office so I figured it couldn't hurt to let him look at it.

He said it looked like a stab wound and was genuinely worried. He walked me to the nurses while grilling me about who stabbed my back. Once in the nurses office he told the lady I was stabbed and to hold me until I wrote a statement and talked to a dean.

It was awkward when I had a room full of people asking me who stabbed me and I had to turn my shirt inside out to show them the massive amount of puss to prove it was a pimple."
"No, he broke the rules. Here are the rules.

1. Treat every gun as if it is loaded, even if you yourself unloaded it. 

2. Never point a gun at anything or anyone that you aren't prepared to destroy or kill. 

3. Be aware of your target, as well as what is beyond your target. 

4. Never put your finger on the trigger until you are prepared to fire.

Most gun owners follow the rules. Unfortunately, some don't and innocent refrigerators lose their lives every day. It's sad. "

"This is a sebaceous cyst. Despite being drained, it is not gone. It will continue to refill. I had a golf ball-sized one along my spine. I used to work in a psych hospital and my bosses (2 nurses) noticed it one night. They gathered 3-4 other nurses, drug me into an exam room, and stabbed it with a needle. The smell was horrible and the amount of substance they expelled from it was incredible. After they did this 3-4 times, I had enough and went to my doctor to have it removed. He told me I was an idiot for letting them do that. He was able to complete the procedure in just a few minutes. No pain and only a few stitches.

Some of the time, Care would back date the plan and wipe the additional charges from the account. I would recommend asking for a supervisor to take a look and see if they can assist you. "
I used to think it was a waste of time that my dad started teaching me gun safety when I was really young. Then I discovered the internet and found out he was saving me from being a dumbass. Thanks Dad.
"I once went for an STD test and got the cotton swab up my urethra too... and I can attest that it is one of the most uncomfortable things I have ever felt. It's like a piece of sandpaper sliding up in side your dick... 

The worst part was after the doctor was finished he said ""oops, I was supposed to use the little one""

What a fucking piece of shit"
A basic LPT is to just not volunteer any information unless absolutely necessary

"You don't need to disclose prescriptions for psychoactive drugs for cleared jobs. The investigation will only look into illegal drug use.

You DO need to disclose any medications that will appear on a drug test prior to the test. (Benzodiazapams, amphetamines, opiates, etc) and even then you can keep that private until you get a positive drug test. But it's a really bad idea to do that for pre employment tests, since they will just not offer you the job rather then tell you the test failed

Edit: Neil_sm below me pointed out if you do need to disclose a Rx you do it to the drug lab not your potential employer

Edit 2: I realized from a couple replies that it should be clear that there isn't one central clearance database. Most of the 3 letter agencies maintain their own background check system. I.e. DoD, DoE, CIA, FBI, etc. My comments were based of DoD and DoE systems"

I was expecting this to end with the discovery that you are a Habsburg.
"I once had the job of cleaning out 3 large chest freezer full of chicken after a 3 week long power failure. I was given several gallons of Lysol, some rubber gloves, an apron, and a cartridge respirator intended for automotive painting. I had to haul the chicken to the dumpster in 5 gallon buckets, and it took me all day. By the end of the day the carbon cannisters in the respirator failed and it smelled worse wearing it than it did in the freezer. 

If I had to do it again I would have turned the freezer back on, froze the entire cube of chicken soup, and hauled it to the dumpster with a forklift."

"Everyone has tasted their own cum at some point right? Just to see what it's like for your girlfriend? Right? I'm not the only one? Shit, should I have used a throwaway?"
But perhaps a bunch of those reports will do the job?

"If I had to guess, the seal on the freezer door was good enough to keep things from drying out. But obviously without power it'll still warm up and then the food would decay. So it'd be rotten but still juicy."

"What you experienced is exactly one of the main reasons I no longer do online dating. I don't fucking understand why people sell themselves as what they are not, knowing damn well they are going to meet someone in person. After the third time meeting someone who looked nothing like their profile picture and/or FAR more than ""a few extra pounds"" I've gone back to the tried and true method of meeting people by chance. I wouldn't sell a car online stating ""no rust, scratches or dents"" when it, in fact, is riddled with them. "
Put a helmet on to get just enough physical resistance. 
"Wait, doesn't this act like a herd of zebras and confuse the shooters vision? I thought this tactic was foolproof on all predators. "
"I am. It was probably a sebaceous cyst. Gross and smelly, yes. Dangerous, no. Cutting it out may be necessary or it may just come back. I popped one of those fuckers in clinic once for a guy and it never ended. Good stuff for those popper people."
"Exactly.  It's not about the rust or the metal... It's about the penetration injury from a dirty/outdoor object.  OP's injury definitely qualifies.

Get to a minute clinic and get your tetanus shot, OP"
It's a sex act your wife is performing on that guy Roger from work. You should probably kill him.

"The real answer is he was more than likely afraid of failing the drug test as a common medication for Adhd is Adderall, which is literally Amphetamine/Dextromamphetamine. On a standard 7 panel drug test this provides a false positive for Methamphetamine. Atleast this is the reason I personally tell possible employers that I have the disorder. "
