"The guy on the far right looks like Mark Zuckerberg. If Zuckerberg were a dwarf with an upside down triangle for a head. Especially in comparison to egg head right next to him. You guys seriously look like caricatures of real people. Also op you may want to boot the Jeffrey Dahmer stand in from your group before he eats one of you. If you're lucky he will eat red pants as her ass alone will keep him sated for weeks. Flash's eyes are so far apart he better avoid the ocean or someone will trap him and class him as a new type of fish.

"My wife did a [Lemonade stand](http://i.imgur.com/uVtvSXM.jpg) with our nephew a few weeks back.  Her plan was to make enough money to take him to incredible pizza (it's like a food buffet, an arcade, and a carnival).  We live on a pretty busy street and she put about $40 into it.  She's offering two flavors of lemonade, cookies, muffins, and iced coffees. I was supportive but knew they wouldn't barely even make their money back.  It's 100 degree memphis summer and I'm not about to go outside that day either. About 6pm I see them packing up so I go outside to help.  I ask her how much she made, she said she didn't know, and points to the money bag.  I count it up and it's $186. They made $26 an hour running a janky lemonade stand in our front yard!  I was fucking mind blown. 

No way this douche is making that much money. "

You guys look like the illegitimate children of a gang bang between the members of Nickleback and Kid Rock that grew up to finance their shitty remake of Clerks with the profits from the meth lab they set up in their trailer.
