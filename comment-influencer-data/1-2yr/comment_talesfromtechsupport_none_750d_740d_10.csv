"I was in Hong Kong on business, with a company-issued laptop.  I spilled coffee (with creamer and sugar) on it.  I toweled it off quickly.  It still worked.  I thought I had dodged a bullet.  But then the ""a"" key stopped working.  But by accident I found that holding down the Shift key and typing ""I"" would give me an a.  I lived with that for about three days, and then I saw that the a key was coming back.  By the time I left Hong Kong, the problem disappeared.  I never told anybody.

"&gt; Why would he think it's ok to plug stuff like that in without telling anyone?

Sometimes the captain needs more power and the engineers need to give her all she's got.

Exploding consoles and redshirts flying across the bridge are just the price you pay for more power."
"I think I would have been more concerned with the fact you got an ""a"" using ""shift + I"" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
"His first clue should have been that absolutely no one uses 24 gauge wire to carry standard line AC.  Usually the smallest you ever see is 18 gauge.

Kudos to $Tech being a professional and just alerting him to the speaker phone nonsense. A lesser person probably would've had sass ready to go.
"He broke the system, but in an entertaining way, and for an actually valid reason.

He cleverly used a customer's foibles against the system.

And he told you exactly what he did and why.

Damn right he deserved one of those T-shirts."

 Nice work. We sometimes get internet through the reflection of an accesspoint in a barbershop and two cars parked in the correct position. It's fun using that specific network because we currently don't have good alternatives. It might be confusing for bystanders why we would go to the barber to fix the internet. "

"Faculty get new computers every 3 to 4 years (old ones repurposed). Dr. Swann came in to get his new laptop, shoved it into his protective carrying case, and watched it shoot out the other side of the case to the floor. Destroyed screen. We now refer to that as a Swann Dive."

"&gt; Rude and cranky store manager accuses me of trying to steal business from Nerd Posse

If this is  the store I think it is...stealing business from them isn't difficult. Their ""techs"" the few times I have asked them something about tech (I am IT, I like to humor myself when bored lol) have given me answers that either make no sense or are just like ""uhhhh lemme think on it"" bro just google it.

We can't. They have told me they can't google things....that is a way of life for IT troubleshooting...but I digress! Good read :D"
"I was too busy laughing, I though it was hilarious.  I just remember him looking confused but still annoyed like his brain was broken and he couldn't think of anything. As my customer started to walk away he just raised his hand and pointer finger up towards them and stuttered a bit like he was trying to think of something important.  I followed them out momentarily and we ironed out the details of the job since we had to shuffle the schedule around a bit."
"This happened at my university. 

There was a generic news letter to something stupid like the faculty of science. An emailing list of easily hundreds, if not a couple of thousand people.  

Granted the way to remove yourself from emails was complicated, but a link to instructions were given at the bottom of the email. So one person replied to the email list

&gt;Please remove me from the email list

This was the cause of the storm. After about 5 ""me to!"" emails, people started replying saying there's instructions at the bottom of the email. Which by this point went quickly unnoticed as 15 people have now also said me too. It was literally 2 or 3 days before it finally stopped. At it's peak I was getting like 100 emails an hour. 90% of it was people saying please remove me from the list, and others yelling at them to stop saying that because i wont work and there's instructions on how to do it."

"We had this computer in another dept, the user complained that they couldn't get their email working because they couldnt type an @, when pressing shift+2 it would instead type a ""?"". Another worker walked up and said oh you can still type that and pressed shift+/ and it made an ""@"". ""&lt;Worker&gt; spilled coffee on it years ago and its been like that since""

They were using that workaround for years."

"No kidding. 

Also, $Tech being a professional probably made $ThatGuy look like even more of an idiot - anybody who could hear $ThatGuy's expletive-laden rant could also hear $Tech proving him wrong by alerting him to what he was doing. Probably why $ThatGuy didn't respond with more abuse for once..."

"Well the barber has modern glass. This glass has got a very thin met all coating to stop sunlight and scratches and be easier to clean. Also this glass reflects Wi-Fi percectly,

 This spooky Wi-Fi then is reflected by the strategically parked cars to our router, which then meshes with it and repeats it for us. If they close the door or open a window it wouldn't work, same goes for our windows.

 It sounds strange, it is strabge but as long as it works, it's fine by me."

I rented a basement apartment under the landlords home a few years ago. Internet was included in rent. Her policy was to switch off her modem before she went to bed to save electric and prevent excess heat. I had to explain to her that I need the internet past 9pm. She had a hard time understanding that. 
"I donâ€™t know much about electronics. Iâ€™m a software guy, but even I know that 1) AC and DC donâ€™t mix and 2) if youâ€™re doing your own wiring, you better double check that the systems can handle the amperage youâ€™re putting through them. 

But here is one thing I do know: when corporate is willing to pay for high-priced equipment, **let them**."
"Quoting myself (from https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2l69y8/you_should_look_it_up_its_a_good_one/ ):

I told this story here before but it fits so..

A colleague showed me how the procedures at a LARGE client work. And then he said ""We'll have a short visit at one of the server admins... he has a simple problem.""

The 'simple problem' was a Novell file server no longer seeing its hard drives.

He opened the case... put his hands on the EISA expansion slots... and said ""HEAL !""

Then he closed the case, powered on the server - which booted without problems.

Look of server admin: PRICELESS.

Somehow I managed to stay calm.

When we left the building I grabbed him and asked ""WHAT DID YOU DO ?""

""Oh... common problem....I just pushed the EISA disk controllers back into the EISA slot."""

"The competition isn't much better. I worked in the electronics department for a similar type of company, we'll call them ""Paperclips"". Manager was an idiot who literally sold a broken desktop to six different customers in a month - each time it got returned as defective, he just re-taped the box and MADE me sell it again.   
  
We also had to push ""CIPS"" - Cables, Ink, Paper, and Services - and that included an in-house antivirus suite, which cost like $60. It was shit.   
  
I ended up telling customers to just go download Avira, Malware Bytes, and SpyBot for free (this was around 2004ish just for context) and rather than losing sales, those people came to trust me more, and only me, and ended up spending THOUSANDS more with us since they knew I would be honest.   
  
Manager didn't give a shit, though. Push CIPS. Push these items. Sell that broken PC. It was so disheartening.   
  
We stopped giving a shit. Managers didn't follow lock-room protocol (only managers were supposed to have keys to the room with laptops, RAM, high value shit, etc.) so other employees started pocketing RAM and SD cards to re-sell (we had no security measures in our store. NONE. Not even cameras.) One employee down-stacked the pallets of printers and scanners by cutting off the plastic wrap and tipping them over onto the concrete dock floor.   
  
I was more benign - I just put brooms and shit into the baler when I was bored. Ended up quitting after the night lead (not even a manager) told me I did a shitty job sweeping the store, even though I'd done it three fucking times and it was spotless.   
  
...can you tell I hated Paperclips? "
Not everyone needs multiple disks.
At least he didn't run it over to the sink and begin washing it. 
"Fun story actually.

 The owner of the place still hasn't got the required information from the ISP for us to set up a router. So while we were searching for a solution we sometimes found our network and sometimes didn't.

 One of us has seen this phenomen before at another place so we checked the accesspoint and had a look on our map where it is physically located. Then we had a little walk with Frankensteins monster, uh, a thing build out of two routers, a power bank and a laptop to see where the signal actually is.

 It was a fun evening. Now we know where to find it and how to fix it if the door is closed or to many waterbags, uh, humans are in the way. We use it with another of Frankensteins creations."
