"Similar thing happened to my dad. Day 1: wow my chest really hurts, probably just indigestion.

Day 2: This must be a bad case of it huh

Day 3: Yeah, I'll go see a doctor why not.

Later in day 3: The doctors told him he was having a heart attack and needed surgery NOW.

"My husband's appendectomy experience was similar. He had awful nausea and stomach pain for a couple of days, and I finally convinced him that he needed to see a doctor. 

We tell the doc my husband's symptoms and he has some tests run. Doc: ""Your appendix needs to come out.""

My husband: ""Can we schedule that for next week? I have to get back to work.""

The doctor's incredulous wtf face shut him up pretty fast and he had surgery that afternoon. "

"I'm sorry this happened to you OP. I am the mother of a son with autism and you clearly didn't MEAN to spill coffee on the table. You reacted to HER and it made the situation so much worse. 

Even if you had burned him, which you clearly didn't, it was an accident. I know it can be extremely stressful traveling with my son but instead of chewing someone out for a mistake, you set a good peer model for them so THEY know how to act if a similar situation ever arises. 

Shame on her behavior. You did nothing wrong and you shouldn't feel bad. "

"I had a similar experience, though for me it was abdominal pain. I was sure my appendix or something had exploded because the pain was seriously 9/10. Halfway to my parents' room, because this was at 3AM *of course*, I doubled over and had to grab a chair to keep from falling and ripped the loudest fart ever. The dog *outside* started barking. On the bright side, the pain was immediately alleviated and I didn't wake up any of my (human) family members. "

There was a lull, then the whole place just fell apart. My SIL was mortified. "
"So let me get this straight....

He is sitting on the other side of a door that swings inward - towards himself - with no way of warning the person opening the door that he is there, in this position?

Someone... possibly multiple someones.... is responsible for this.  It ain't you.  There is no version of this where you are responsible.  

The first time someone seems to indicate you are responsible 'you should be more careful opening doors' you put things in terms EXACTLY like I did.

Throw it back at the dickbags face, 'why was he sitting in the path of how a door opens?  Who the fuck does this?  Does OSHA know?  has an injury report been filled out?

In fact, why wasn't I consulted about the injury report?  Why was none filled out?  I m calling HR...'.

"You are not alone buddy, the exact same thing happened to me (except the vacation part). I thought I was constipated, but after 5 days of feeling that way, I thought it was not normal. At hospital, I had a cat-scan and they rushed me into surgery minutes later.

The surgeon told me next morning that I came very close to dying, that the infection already started to spread and she had no idea why I was not boiling with fever. My blood test confirmed that I was pretty sick. They put me on a big antibiotic treatment + morphine for the pain. Then 3 days of hell in hospital with my body finally shutting down due to infection (they cleaned up as much as they could in surgery but the damage was done).


24 hours before my surgery I was playing golf with my dad. When he came to see me in hospital in the morning, he said what a dad would say in this occasion ""I knew you were dying, that's why I let you win!"""

My mom investigates by looking thru the peephole at the same time that she touched the door knob to open he put his finger over the peep hole. My mom froze. She freaked out a little(lot) she grabbed me and my sister grabbed the phone and we went to my sisters bedroom closet. The furthest away from the door. She called 911 and explained what was happening. She sat on the phone for a few minutes they asked if he was still outside, she checked and said yes but this time he was pounding on the door, even the dispatch heard it and said something about it. Few moments after my mom comes back to the closet I heard the dispatcher say they don't have any on duty officers in our area but they're sending one then to check everything out. Still on the phone my mom was told the officer was turning down our street To investigate the area first and then he'll be here to stay on the line. Cop shows up. Checked the property, checked the whole neighborhood, not a soul insight. I think that quick thinking saved my mom from getting pushed in. It was a big issue in our area for a while. We had about 7 the span of 3 months. "
"I feel like this is more about your damage control than eating expired food. Firing might be a bit harsh, but your first instinct was to start lying to him so how does he know you're not going to do that with something else? If you would've just said they're expired you'd probably gotten a warning."

"As an aside because of that wildly inaccurate article.

It was a disaster, but not caused by any flaws in the design. The higher ups told the plant operators to ignore the fucking manual, and keep the turbines spinning as long as they could. To do this the operators had to override saftey mechanisms that would have turned the turbines off. This caused a pressure saftey valve to be deactivated. The valve cause a huge amount of steam buildup, and a chemical explosion ensued. I specify chemical explosion due to the fact that there was not an actual meltdown. Had there been a nuclear explosion, like you get in certain meltdown scenarios, Moscow, and the people who ordered this, would not exist. 

I really get sick and tired of all the false information here. There has only been 1 full meltdown (intentionally caused in a sealed cave), and 1 partial meltdown (three mile island) of any reactor either land or sea based in history, both occurred in the US. Fukushima and Chernobyl were horrible accidents. The former caused by a ""fuck you"" wall of water, aka tsunami. The latter caused by a chemical explosion, caused by idiots.   "
