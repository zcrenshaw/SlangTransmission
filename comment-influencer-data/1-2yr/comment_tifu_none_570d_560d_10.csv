"That looks like it was set on your skin way too long. As for how it looks now, you need to go to the doctor yesterday. 

I've seen people get branded and I've seen them heal. It should not look like this. Go to the doctor.

Double edit: thanks for my first gold, kind stranger! "
Honestly TIFU is an understatement here. 
In 3 more weeks it'll be TIFU be needing to get my arm amputated. 
Buddy at this point the penis is the least of your worries
I know! I couldn't ask for a better heads up. It made me think it must be a pretty good place to work.
"I pretty much clicked on this TIFU to learn what cracked olives as well, so thanks for the TIL. Hope you didn't crack a tooth."
I mean who organizes an event with 75+ people with 2 crap porta potties?

"The real FU was Ethan not having “At A Medium Pace” playing over the phone when Ned got there.

Please do an AMA after the amputation. 
Classic Titty Boobowitz.

"Just say its an illegal business that will get you in jail



***EDIT:*** i dont have a negative stance toward it at all. just maybe he isnt ready for the talk. Different kids mature at different ages. To say one age he is ready and another isn't when you dont know the kid at all is wrong. He knows his kid more than anyone else. Maybe he just isn't ready for the talk until later.

But being that he knows it's illegal, he knows to not really speak of it publicly at least not for the time being. He's not cementing one idea in his head, he's just giving a temporary hold on the question before he can elaborate on it when the kid is more socially aware and doesn't talk about taboo subjects when he doesn't understand how the world works yet.

Everyone has different moral standards. Calling someone a judgemental prick for not personally being okay with the idea of prostitution is judgemental in itself. 

As of now, in (***EDIT 2:*** MOST OF) the US at least it's illegal and I'd rather my kid (key word ***MY***) not go around telling people he wants to sell his body to people. I'd get CPS on my ass by a concerned parent and it's just safer he doesn't know for a few more years when he's ready. Like geez, the kid is nine. He shouldn't be thinking of sex for another couple years at least given that he wasn't a really early bloomer or stumbled on the birds and bees and needs a talk earlier."

Look at the video. They pressed the brand for 8 seconds. A red hot brand. Imagine what that would do to a steak. Now go look at the after pic again.
Agreed. In hindsight you should have just followed through with the song as soon as he opened up pornhub
Just apply again under your real name 
"Maybe its for the better, a child that never sees anything go wrong or never handles stressful situations will have a hard time growing up in the real world, experiences like this are important in my opinion in maturing a child and teaches valuable lessons if delivered the right way."

I can’t believe the cop booked you when you called for help! Sorry that happened to you OP. 
You're thinking of Prosciutto. Prostitution is a type of Italian sparkling wine. 
"Lol dude you fucked up. I accidentally touched my arm to the side of a hot clothes iron (not a red hot brand) for the fraction of a second before noticing the pain and I still have a mark two years later. It looks like a Nike swoosh kinda. 

Also your arm might need to be amputated soon which would be an even more impressive TIFU. "

"It's unclear, if I'm being completely honest. I want to say yes? He didn't say we *weren't* friends? But he hasn't been as chatty as he used to be, that's for sure. Hopefully things will go back to normal after a year or two."

"Had a similar experience in Louisville Kentucky. I was stationed at Fort Knox and during the weekend my friends and I went out to a bar. I was sober and at that time had a very high alcohol tolerance. We walked into the bar and a lady approached us with 2 glasses of beer thanking us for our service, I thanked her and drank it while my buddy only prefered bottled not draft so he refused, ended up not drinking anything else and blacking out shortly after. No recollection of what happened after, woke up vomiting in a motel room the next morning with my friends in awe. Luckily for me I had good people around to make sure nothing happened to me."
If you haven't already you might want to have that looked at by a doctor.
"I have the same setup as you and I actually had the same thing happen to me with my original PS4 last year.  I was playing a lot of emulators etc., on my PC and I was having issues getting Input Mapper working for a few minutes and wondering what the hell was going on.  I go and turn the input to the PS4 and I see 4 games downloading, 4 brand new full priced games...

I knew that we were a little short on money that week so I was shitting bricks while my gf was sleeping at the time, so I spent the next hour or so crapping my pants and chatting to support about the issue, stating what happened and that neither game was loaded up etc.

They sent it off to be reviewed and thankfully they refunded everything to my paypal, at first they offered to refund to wallet but I begged for it to be a full refund and they eventually obliged.  The crap part is it took another week for the money to get back to my bank account, but thankfully it worked out in the end.

That was the day I made sure to set up all the passwords for purchases so it could never happen again."
No that's the perineum. Prostitution is a water film that develops on the skin to help cool the body.

"My wife got a black fly bite on the very edge of her eye a few years back. She reacts really strongly to black fly bites, and for whatever reason (maybe the location on her body?), it swelled up even worse than normal - she looked like she had been absolutely DECKED by someone. 

She was super upset about it, of course, but not at all prepared for getting asked by multiple people at work if everything was OK at home. Luckily she works with good friends of ours who were able to kind of vouch for me so the cops didn't get called or anything, but people were really concerned and on the verge of doing so. 

It stung a little bit, at first, that people thought I would hit my wife, but then I realized that a) none of the people jumping to that conclusion had ever met me and b) it's kind of awesome that we live in a society where people are that concerned and willing to ask if a person who might be at risk needs help. "
Actually yes...
"plastic surgeon here.... the good news is that it doesn't look infected like most people are saying, but it will scar very badly, not with any of the definition of an arrow and possibly like a penis. You need to have this skin grafted and serial excised for best outcome at this point."
No that's perforation. Prostitution is an oldtimey guy that digs for gold.

"As a surgical doctor - it depends on the treatment.


If I saw this patient, I'd offer them a debridement and skin graft (cut the whole area of skin out and put a fresh piece on) - in that case, I'd cut it out as a rectangle, so it didn't look like a penis.


The other option is to let it heal by itself.  It is not infected (despite what some other comments say), so with regular dressings, it will heal....in the shape of a penis."

"I’m thinking these guys tried to treat it like branding cattle. Problem is cattle have much thicker and tougher skin than we do. For example when freeze branding cattle you’ll leave that sucker on for 25-30 seconds. With a hot brand obviously the time is much shorter, 5-10 seconds, depending on who you ask, breed, age, heat if the fire, etc. I’d imagine branding human skin shouldn’t take more than 3, judging by the burn scar on my hand from 14 years ago that has shown no signs of fading.

"STOP PICKING/WASHING YOUR SCAB OFF. You absolutely suck at wound care.

^(Disclaimer: I only know this because I, too, once sucked at wound care, and had a scab that kept coming off that looked identical)

You're probably not ""infected"", what's happening is your body doesn't have anything there to protect the blood inside it from the world outside it (or more specifically, your exposed nerves are telling it that's the case), so it's oozing plasma since it can't get platelets there directly due to the scabbing in the exposed and injured pores (all those dots). You keep washing/rubbing it off, which is a huge part of why it's a big mess instead of just a crappy brand.

Apply triple-antibiotics, give it *lots* of air during the day, wrap it only at night (in order to keep you from brushing it off in your sleep) until it hardens.

Oh, and yeah, it's gonna be a giant cock'n'balls, mostly b/c you suck at branding *and* wound care... if you don't die from an infection."

*Ned and his bride have said their vows, kissed passionately, and stamped the glass. As the party starts, a familiar tune echoes to Ned's ears.

"Something similar happened to me in 2014. I was at Webster hall in NYC with my boyfriend. We were seeing a band (horse the band) and having drinks. One second I’m singing along and the next I’m trying to get in and out of unlocked BMW’s in a dealer parking lot. At that point I was in and out of consciousness and trying to see if one of the cars would start. Looking back I don’t know what I would have done since the cars were 3-4 rows deep (it was a separate storage lot from the main dealer). 

Eventually I climbed into the back seat of one and fell asleep. When I came to again it was morning and I realized I was a couple towns over from my home in NJ. I had no bag, phone, or shoes and I was covered in vomit. Without much choice I began to walk home but realized I would probably get picked up for looking crazy. I came across a Dunkin donuts (it was 6am on a Sunday so no one else was open) and asked them to call the cops.

The cops show up and I tell them what I remember (not much) and at this point I’m hysterically crying because I’m scared and I don’t know where my BF is. Convinced I had been roofied they called an ambulance. Nothing came up in my blood work at the hospital and I refused a rape kit. They said I had just had the worlds worst black out. They eventually got in touch with my boyfriend who was home asleep. 

The story goes we were at the concert until about 11pm (my blackout began around 9pm). We left Webster hall and took a cab to port authority. He went to the bathroom and i wandered away. As he was looking for me two women text him using my phone that I’m at gate number such and such and I’m QUITE drunk. He collects me and we get on the bus back to NJ. I then proceed to puke all over myself and him on the bus. When we reached the town I ended up in I started crying that I wanted to get off the bus so he hits the stop button. We get off but he realizes I’ve left my bag. He goes back on to look for it but can’t find it. While he’s on the bus I wandered off behind a bank and eventually made my way to the BMW lot the next block over (it’s a very wealthy town so the gate was open and all the cars unlocked).

My boyfriend couldn’t find me so he had no choice but to walk over an hour to our apartment and then call a 24 hour locksmith ($150 fee) to open our door since my keys were in the bag. Once in he got his car keys and spent another hour or two driving around looking for me. He finally went home and passed out around 5am until a cop woke him up around 7am to let him know I was in the hospital. 

I got really lucky because an hour or so after coming home from the hospital a woman showed up with my bag. Said her son found it. Everything was there except my cigarettes.

I’ve never told anyone this because I’m so ashamed of myself for it. Now all of TIFU knows."

"Yeah she ended up taking my stuff to the police so I was able to get it all back besides my debit card which was gone, and had been charged for a lyft that wasn't on my account and some parking. I cancelled it and can't really be asked to look much more into it."
"For the entirety of my 20s, about 100% of my friends were car guys. We'd hang out every weekend working on each other's projects. 

When one of the guys would get engaged to their girlfriend, it started a timer on their death. Once they got married, they disappeared forever. It happened to every damn one of them. Including me."

"Bah :( Same story. Thankfully we aren´t that short on money, it was a bummer anyway tho. I kept on thinking ""you could´ve bought a lot of nice things with that money""..."
"No kidding, and does milque-toast, kind and quiet, casserole loving Ned who rarely has a girlfriend sound like the kind of dude that would love to have dirty intimate details of his porn watching habits revealed about him at his wedding?"
I almost forgot about that! Anesthesia is one hell of a drug!
"Here's what I went through with general anesthesia, I've been under it twice: 

It knocks you out pretty quickly. It'll be like you blink, and you're literally in the recovery room. It'll probably be hard for you to sit up or move with coordination, but don't panic, this goes away after only a few minutes. 

You'll probably be a little confused, but in my experience and what most doctors say, unless you get a certain type of anesthesia, you won't act like those YouTube videos of people speaking nonsense. It'll just feel like you just woke up from a super intense sleep, and you also teleported so you're trying to figure everything out. 

The most important thing to remember is that you'll feel weird and kind of feel like shit. But the good news is that it doesn't last long, especially since you're skinny. The drug stores in the fat cells, so it probably won't take you as long to wake up. Your throat might also hurt from the breathing tube like mine did, but again nothing too bad. 

If you're nauseous when you wake up, tell them. Same thing with in pain. They can immediately give you something that will help. Some people feel nauseous waking up from anesthesia like I did, but thankfully the medicine works quite fast since they put it through your IV. 

That's really all I can think of. The main thing is to stay calm, because it can feel kind of alarming when you first wake up, especially with struggling to sit up. The important thing to remember though is that you're not going to be paralyzed when you wake up, you just have poor coordination like an infant, and your muscles are still weak. But, it wears off quickly. "
Well that makes me feel slightly better about myself.    
"the fact you misspelled ""to"" in response to a comment on how stupid you are is comedy genius."
"absolutely. Unless OP is a liar, he was callling the police for help as he may have been drugged and more, yet instead of a sympathetic ear and help, placed in jail. disgusting."
"Yes, If not for Ethan, /u/foogama would still be in the closet to this day."
Watched that video. The most disturbing part was the sound of someone barfing at the very end.
"Haha the old ""tricking people into killing you"" prank.

Works every time one time."
"Yeah, I was watching that video and thinking ""You can stop now. Any time... Any time. Umm... stop? Now? Stop? Jesus..."""
"I told my sister about what happened and she said if they knew your dog they would understand lol. 

I get that it's their job and people do cover abuse so I'm glad they do that, I just felt so horrible for how my husband must of felt when they asked that. He also told me he thought the Drs were trying to secretly confirm my story somehow by asking me my dogs breed and info on my dog because I don't know what that really had to do with anything."

"Yep, 40 min from the concert venue, about an hour from my apartment. "
He's doing just fine lol. 
Holy shit dude I'm glad you are all right. did you get your stuff back?...............
"Say you get in every day at 8:20 because of whatever reason (bus, dropping wife off, serving breakfast to the homeless, etc) so you just leave 8hrs later. Followed by ""why is 4:20 significant?"" And when they explain why just gasp and say that you would never do the drugs."
Message Google AdWords support explain your situation and see what options they can provide for you. Make sure to clearly outline your misunderstanding. For the time being I wouldn’t mention your financial situation or your inability to pay the fees as it can be taken the wrong way.
"No that's penetration. Prostitution is all the inhabitants of a particular town, area, or country."
Omfg Why is this so funny 
Maybe that's why you don't get drunk before doing a controlled body fuck up.
I mean honestly being a male probably had something to do with it. Nobody at the jail cared at all/ probably didn't believe me. 
"I mean I'm not trying to be sexist or anything but generally people will not take a male being drugged as seriously as a female. The kindest response I got from an officer there was ""that sucks"" "
I also must have walked a pretty long distance because both of my shins are in really bad pain when I walk. At some point I was in the girls car though. All very confusing 
"No, that's polyperforation. Prostitution is when you prepare and issue a book for sale. "
Dude...what college kid does not fap before bed? How did you not see this coming lol
"I'll take ""Things that should be taken to the grave"" for $1000, Alex."
A few years back my mother was in a car accident and had a super brutal looking black eye. My dad refused to go out in public with her due to all the nasty looks he got. 
"Tomorrow, they are going to upgrade you to room 1408."
I wish I hadn't read this. That's what happened to me.

Whelp...now my most upvoted comment is about eating prostitutes..."
"You.

The.

Right.

Thing.

This is indeed her choice, it was her decision to break up with you, but what she wants is for you to continue to orbit around her and provide her with attention. She is in a new place, probably with many new opportunities to obtain attention and resources through a relationship, and is looking to branch over to those opportunities. If you had “stayed friends”, it would have been only as a backup plan; a security blanket she could return to if everything that happened there went south. 

Essentially, she wants to eat her cake and have it too. And that will only ever end badly for you.

I am almost finished my fifth decade on this rock, and in all my years I have discovered that clean breaks - no takesies-backsises - is by far the best way to go. She found some new opportunities and wanted to leverage them, so it is by far the best thing for your mental health to sever that relationship. To fail to do so is to have a wound that continues to get re-opened every time she circles back around to you. Remember -- she was never yours, *it was just your turn.*"
you tryna be a funny guy?
I’m currently waiting on a friend. Don’t wanna go alone
"What? You thought your generation invented teabagging? Nah dude, those baby boomers perfected that game. You just got an og teabagging."
