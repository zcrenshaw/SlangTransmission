Your boss is savage.
"&gt; Finally my manager just told her fine, we will credit her for the 4 additional bags SHE requested but that in the future if she orders product, she will have to pay for it.

Epic fail by your manager.  She will 100% repeat this behavior"

"This is like my mother when she goes to an unfamiliar new website, or gets an error message on the computer and she doesn't know what to do.  

&gt;Right click on the file

&gt;[double clicks, opening it]

&gt;No, right click.  Close it and try again.

&gt;Close it. Close...

I'm sorry, I couldn't continue. I feel my blood pressure rising."
"I have to say, I'm loving all these heart-warming stories coming up on  this sub! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Got to love customers who never listen. Even if the total was 10 and the customer handed you a 10. Even if the cashier accidentally typed 20, the till count would not be affected at all. 

Customers. Huh. It's like you need to explain things to them with sock puppets"
"Hero we need, deserve, etc."
"Had a similar experience. A customer I have seen a few times came into my cell phone store with a broken screen wanting to get it fixed. We don't fix screens, let alone fruit phones, so we told her that she would have to file an insurance claim to have them replace the whole phone. Her screen was black and unusable. She broke down sobbing on the floor of our sales department because her 5 year old daughter had just passed away and she was trying to recover the photos off of the phone, which we couldn't do with a non working screen. 

I made her an appointment at the fruit store for repair instead and they were able to fix her screen for the same price as an insurance claim and she kept her photos. 

It took everything I had not to start crying with her. My manager was on the floor hugging her so tight while she just bawled. The worst experience of my life with a customer, because I couldn't help her when I really wanted to. "
I hope karma rewards you.
"*'I'll act crazy so they'll give me free cigs' * 

Some people man..."

"Honestly, why hasn't your company fired her as a customer already? She's already COST you money - both for the bags and the delivery.  And peace of mind if she's that nasty.  Time to have a heart to heart with the manager about the cumulative effect this woman is having on the business.  And fire her next time she calls in like this."
"I remember when I tried to help some French customers. They asked me if I spoke French. I didn't want to oversell myself so I said ""un peu."" The couple threw their hands up in disgust and said ""Un peu?"" and made an annoyed grunt and walked away.

I mean, I had taken like 5 years of French and was *okay* at speaking it. I'm sure I could have helped them more than any of the other country bumpkins. "
"You mean you‚Äôre not psychic? Gasp! Don‚Äôt you know all retail slaves need to be psychic‚ÄΩ 

I kid. lol"
Do you happen to sell any ‚Äúsorry I kicked you out of the store‚Äù cards?
Stories like this make me want to go into business as a consulting hard-ass. Pay me $5 and I'll tell your customers no.
I have no idea. Especially at a grocery store.... so confused.
"Here's the thing, my manager very rarely gives into this sort of behavior. Without going into details, this woman is completely nasty everytime she calls. Every. Single. Time. It's to the point where when we see her name on caller ID, we all cringe and whoever ends up having to talk to her has to take a break after the call. My manager actually tried to get her to understand for nearly 20 minutes that she needed to pay for that salt. She finally gave in because frankly she knew she would be on the phone being verbally abused for as long as it took. Yeah it's a crappy situation and neither of us were happy about it but whether or not she was given credit, she would always be an unreasonably, nasty witch every time she calls. That's just who she is. "
Gotta have a sense of humour in retail haha
Manager should have called the police. Absolutely unacceptable behavior in any situation. 
"As someone who has had a pharmacist bend the rules because I was having an asthma attack and a panic attack at the same time, fuck that lady. It's people like her who make it difficult for people in a real emergency."
The trademark on Paying Customer is legendary 
#1 boss right there.
"""YOU CAN'T TELL ME TO LEAVE, THAT'S ILLEGAL!""

Actually, considering you are on store property and just wasting our time, we can tell you to do whatever we want. We could refuse your sale too even if you had another form of payment because of this outburst."

"A 7 looks similar to a 0, in the same way a bird looks like a dolphin. They are both animals. Easy to mix up. "
"My husband and unfamiliar websites. 
Me: Oh, click on ""Account""
Him: ...
Me: On the right
Him: Aimlessly moves mouse.
Me: Down.... further right.... up.... it's red!"
"Knowing smokers that haven't had a smoke in a while, hearing anything along the lines of ""give me my f!#cking cigarettes mother f!#cker!!"" Is a some what reasonable request. 

But that's between friends.... not a clerk. "
"I love your lack of effort here, +1 Reddit sliver "
She's probably one of those people who drives to the store in the middle of a blizzard and gets angry that they weren't open for her.....
I'm glad he verified that it wasn't an emergency for the medication. You never know what situation the other person is in until you ask. 
"Sigh, I collect these ""rare"" 50p coins in a little box under my bed. 
One day 
gf ""oh here"" *hands me about ¬£7"" 
Me : what's this for?
Gf : oh I borrowed some money from you
... You can finish that story for yourself....
She then goes to a shop a couple days later, hands over the last of the 50ps (a Peter rabbit) to a shop keeper, similar situation to this.
Realises she hadn't spent them all when cashier mentions it
She asks for it back, cashier says no, pockets it.

*Sigh*

I have a warning on the box now, slowly rebuilding my Olympic set and still looking to replace my Kew gardens, (somewhat rarest of them all) ... Still together"
"You can mostly tell who can joke with. We always get ""the internet says you have it"". Only once did I say what I always think. It was to an old boy ""well the internet also says their are hot young Asian girls just waiting to meet me too"". Every time he comes in now he has a joke for me.üòÄ"
"And I was expecting the end to be, ""And today the family came in the store, for a zombie Dad looks like he's doing pretty good."""
He knows exactly what he is doing and is pretty calm about it? That guy sounds like a textbook psychopath.
"""Please incur thousand dollars of damages so I can buy 5$ worth of merchandise"""
She wastes your time because she believes you‚Äôre going to swing your magic wand and make potting mix appear out of thin air to sell to her. 
While I can see being annoyed at a color shift when you weren't expecting one.... What an ass.
"And the follow-up...
Husband: *does something he didn't mean to do*
Me: no,  go back... you need to click on ""Account"".
Husband: HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW"
We could refuse your sale just because we feel like it. People don‚Äôt seem to realize that stores are not required to sell them anything.
I see you encountered an adult toddler. They‚Äôre fun to deal with aren‚Äôt they?
‚ÄòHow was I supposed to know there weren‚Äôt going to be little men included in the box that would install this for me?! That is false advertising and I will have your job!!!‚Äô
Your boss has given me life.
I‚Äôve actually gone in and bought three different types of curtains before just so I could go home and see how the colors matched the room. I returned the ones I didn‚Äôt like 
But you did help her. At least the best you could. Even small seeming things like calling and making an appointment for someone when they are that distressed are so much more helpful than people realize.
"Trying to be true to my name here.  She probably felt that she was only informed of the 'no return' policy after she bought the item and didn't like being told of it after the fact.  Probably had nothing better to do, also.  ""I want to see the manager' haircut?"
"Years ago I actually had a customer call the police over a similar situation. The police tried to explain the same concept that what the cashier entered doesn't matter. She wasn't having it so I offered to review the camera footage with the cops. They came back to the security office with me and watched, they agreed that the customer was not correct in accusing my cashier. Even after that we got notification from corporate that she complained. Some people."
"Most people won‚Äôt help unless they know what to do as they realize they can do more harm than good. 

In those situations having two people doing something while more stand around is actually the best. More bodies in the way and you can‚Äôt adequately treat the kid. Especially if all of them are clueless on what to do. 

You did everything correct. Call 911 and follow instructions. 

I strongly feel all public workers should have basic life support training and an AED available. "
"So, she changed her name a year ago, but in all that time has not bothered to update her information with whatever companies she orders from? I'd hate to see what her credit cards and medical records look like...."
"I mean if you said fixture that holds things, instead of shelf, i would guess english was your second language, but would be more impressed you said fixture that holds things rather than saying shelf."
What were you expecting to just open the box and it would magically float itself onto the wall? You can't just hang a tv off drywall. 
"Well, you're nicer than I am, I would have said she could take the discount price or I could remove the discount and we could go back to the regular price..."
"It's fun.  Not only is nice stuff nice, but it's exciting to spend the whole post waiting for the nasty twist."
Oh god. What a dream job.
Haha *killme*
"In Turkey, it's a cross between the German and Italian ones. They're ecstatic to find someone who's trying to speak their language, they'll speak to you in English, then try to help you out with Turkish. I love it.

My dad speaks near fluent Turkish (certainly enough to get by) and it's good fun to go shopping with him in touristy places, because they think he's a tourist, then he just bats them down with a string of Turkish rebuttals."
The bill swapping is an attempt to confuse you into returning too much change. She got mad because she was foiled.
"The funniest part for me is that the blocks he purchased from the other location must have been a bad batch as I've never seen them yellow, and I've unloaded hundreds of pallets of them off the delivery truck in the time that I have been working there.  "
"""Let me transfer you to our disconnection department."" *hangs up*"
"Proboly not, but I'm sure there are some ""I'm sorry you're a raging bit**"""
What...the fuck LOL
"Because the lines are too long and they don't want to waste their time.

*proceeds to spend 15 minutes at self-checkout screaming at a piece of machinery instead of spending 5 minutes in line at a normal register*"
I feel bad for all the people he got fired
