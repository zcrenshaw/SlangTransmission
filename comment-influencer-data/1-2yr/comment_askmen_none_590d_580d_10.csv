"I take 3-5 mins, 10 tops. My dad on the other hand used to take forever. He would sit there, reading, til his legs fell asleep. He would literally walk out of there holding walls and countertops because his legs were dead. 
It was the funniest shit ever. (Pun intended)"
That men have no emotions. Jesus I may not cry so often but little things do hurt me or go a long way in making me happy. Getting a new haircut and not getting any compliments can make me insecure or a you look good from anyone can make my day. We are emotional but we may not always show it. 
"You asked for it. After a few failed relationships in my early 20's, I had pretty much given up. At 28 met a fantastic woman, we fell very deeply in love and married 2 years later. After 13 years of marriage, she died suddenly of a heart attack while I slept next to her. True story."
The pooping part takes about 5 mins. Doesn't stop me from spending 15 in there and almost falling over when I get up because my legs no longer work.

Had a girl in a bar turn me down when I asked for her number by saying matter-of-factly that she wasn't interested because she didn't really see Asian men as men. 
"They just scream ""I'm insecure and crave social media affirmation"".

They're the equivalent to the endless slide projector ""this is us in Venice greeting pigeons"" ""this is us in Venice feeding pigeons"" ""this is us in Venice getting shat on by pigeons"" shows of my youth.

They are proof you cannot enjoy a mountaintop, party night, or wedding for its own sake and be fully in the moment, but only experience it vicariously through the attention and applause you get for it online."
"Mid thrust girl asked if I was gay.

That was the worst relationship I've ever had, she was nuts."
"Guys like alone time. Sometimes that is in a man cave, or a bar room, and sometimes it's in a bathroom. 


Edit: I can't believe one of my most popular comments is about why guys like to spend time in the bathroom. "
You were engaged? She just started college? Damnnnn you'll look back at this one day and just realize this is the biggest blessing ever. Congrats my dude. Sulk for a few days but then go out there and celebrate the fact that you dodged a train of pain for years to come. Congrats man. 
"I had an ex who went to an energy healer and they told her she was my mother in a past life.  She then proceeded from that moment forward to talk maternally to me.  Started speaking to me like you'd speak to a dog or some shit.  It would make me mad, but if I showed the anger she'd treat me like I was a kid with a temper tantrum.  It was one of the weirdest things I've experience for sure haha.  "
"I'm a pretty ugly guy and also messed up my body further by being obese through puberty. Being bullied in school and seeing my parents destroy themselves in their unhappy marriage probably didn't help either. By my mid-twenties I had exhausted all possible venues for improving my attractiveness - I was at my best and my best was objectively unattractive. So I gave up and started just focusing on enjoy life and avoiding being depressed about loneliness - it didn't always work and sometimes I would get bouts of crippling sadness several days long. 

And then a little over a year ago I met someone through a friend. We had a lot of common interests and views, which was normal enough, but then it turned out she also finds me very attractive. So, I lost my virginity to her at 32 years old. We've been happily together ever since."

"Honestly, I feel bad for being judgemental, but there are a lot of ""basic bitch"" stereotypes that I've come to loathe.

I don't care what kind of Frappuccino a woman drinks, but things like ""live, laugh, love"" wall art and a constant stream of ""relationship goals"" posts on social media typically indicate a lack of self awareness and unreasonable expectations for life in general.

Edit: Oh, and anything remotely resembling ""wine mom"" mentality. "
I always put the lid down before I flush. I thought that was normal 
"My dick and my brain are separate entities that can influence each other, but neither has total control. It's not like I WANTED to get an erection in church or while hearing that story about the dude getting boiled alive in the sewers. It just happened, OKAY? Also, hate-boners are a thing, Karen!"
"Getting a random boner at work and not being able to leave your desk.

"Girls who post their entire lives to social media. 

My ex was/is constantly complaining about her life on Twitter, or posting every little thing about her relationships. 

When I was with her she'd post about the nice things I'd do for her, or gives me subtle jabs when we were arguing, or asked me to pose for snapchat stories. I gave in most times, but I really hated having MY relationship broadcast like its everyone's business."

"The clueless/inept or careless dad stereotype. Commercials and tv shows show dads who, when they are at home with their kids have a huge messy kitchen, or house,  sometimes the struggle to or can't change a diaper.  Also, the thought that when I'm with my kids I'm ""babysitting."" Umm, no, I'm parenting.  "
"None of them, as far as I know."

"The pooper is a man's last refuge for uninterrupted alone time.  And sometimes the dog pushes open the door as if to say ""Whaddup, bro, what ya doin"".

"So you're engaged, supposedly, and you can't just go talk to her face to face? This sounds like an internet ""girlfriend""."
"Whhhooooo boy, do I feel your pain here.

Pardon the upsmanship, I'm not trying to be better at you for missing lifetime benchmarks, but my story's relevant.

I was home-schooled. I missed *all* of high school. I missed the boat on relationships and everything else for that period.

I went a bit nuts in my 20's because of that. With that said, this is my sincere, heartfelt advice.

*focus on the long-term*. It *matters*. A whole bunch. Work you your long game.

You're 25 now and you're starting to feel the pressure to 'get a life', which means getting friendships and relationships and what have you out of the way. I get it.

That impatience will *destroy you.* Do not let it control you.

Believe it or not, a lot of those people you think 'found themselves?' They didn't. And their lives *might* be filled with despair over *their* choices. The grass is not necessarily greener. 

Yet.

But it *can* get worse, if you let fear and impatience drive you into pursuing friendships and relationships without a solid foundation.

Set a goal for where you want to be at 35. It will need to be achievable.

Focus on financial independence - if not *completely*, then at least to the point where fucking off to Europe for a year won't break your bank.

Your credit score matters. Your work history is important. And if you can't go to college, at least make sure you get industry certifications and/or trade recognition. Beware of hucksters.

When that's on track, then *and only then* have the adventure. You will be able to have your cake and eat it too, at that point.

Let me tell you what you *really* want. You don't want friends. You *do* want friends that won't suck you dry. You don't want a relationship. You *do* want a relationship with a woman who you can build a good home and a rewarding life with. That is *so much easier* to get when you have pocket money and aren't living hand-to-mouth, you wouldn't believe. It's pretty near *impossible* otherwise. Even for the people who had the high-school and Uni hatchling phase. 

Make sure you're working every day towards *not working*, and you're much more likely to have the freedom to choose the life you want."
"After 23 years of marriage, when it was clear I was going to file for divorce, she tells me ""You know, you'll probably never have sex again."" Thanks for the vote of confidence! Believe it or not this was, I believe, an attempt to get me to stay. Divorce definitely happened. I haven't had sex yet, but I will when I'm ready, even if it's just to spite her."
Putting our 5 year old in a head lock and telling him to ask for mercy. 
"I will be specific.  Sitting on a park bench, daydreaming in the sun.  Eyes closed.  Have a brief sexual thought that turns into a daydreamy sexual fantasy.  Realize you have bulging erection.  Open eyes, realize there are small children playing right in front of you.  Experience actual terror."
"Making out with a girl. I asked if it was okay to take her pants off. She said, and I quote, “Ugh, don’t be such a pussy. Be a man. Just go for it.”"
"This is probably not what you're really looking for but it's a good story that needs to be told. I met a girl, we got married, had five kids, and then she died of ovarian cancer. Eight months later a friend asks me if I ever think about remarrying. I respond, ""I'm a 41 year old widower with five kids that range in age from 15 to 3. Who's going to have me?"" A month later I met this woman through a mutual friend. She is not interested in me at all. A week later we meet up and I have the kids along. She falls in love with the kids, I get a second look, 3 months later we were married. That was twenty years ago. Life is good."
"Speak for yourself.  I manspread to oppress women, minorities, the elderly, and kittens born with only one eye."
All we care about is sex and getting laid. I'm very picky and it matters a lot to me only if its someone special.
That when asked “what are you thinking about?” And we reply with “nothing” we can genuinely be thinking about nothing and be zoned out completely.
I got into face masks because of my ex. Now my skin glows. Best thing from that relationship lmao.

Women will never understand that when you're a man you have to sometimes use a one-handed kamehameha with the help of your recently deceased father so you can save the world from a perfectly evolved bio-android.
"I shit you not, I used to play ""I just had sex"" by the lonely island the morning after my gf (now ex) and I would have sex.

Why she dumped me, I'll never know"
"We sit with our legs spread because we have testicles and ""manspreading"" is a sexist term that all women should be embarrassed to use."

"I'd have just gone whole hog with it.  Make her pack you lunch for work, Hell, bring work home at night and make her help with your ""homework"".  Wake her up randomly in the middle of the night to ask pointless questions.  Make her drive you around places.

If she wants to pretend she's your mom, act like a kid and annoy the shit out of her."
"That we can just walk around at night, worry free. I've been mugged, it wasn't a fun experience, and I always feel uncomfortable walking alone at night."
"God damn it I keep forgetting to get a towel ready.

""Ok tilt it up while I go find something"" "
"My oldest sons mom lied and said she was on birth control when she had stopped taking it. I was 18 and in high school at the time. It showed she is basically nuts and not anyone I wanted to spend my life with. She spiraled out of control and I got custody when my son was 4. I met my wife when my son was 14 months old and she has helped me raise him. 

His mother got clean for a while, popped back in, but then got upset when he wasn’t ready to engage with her (after about 10 years). She recently sent me an email blaming he and I for her relapse, because he didn’t give her what she needed. I made her well aware when she originally requested to try making a relationship with him that it would be on his terms and when he was ready. I feel for her. Addiction is a mother fucker."
That men can’t be raped by women. As if we are all a bunch sex addicted perverts who will let anyone sleep with us. 
"I'm 5'9 and a buddy of mine is 6'6, we went to a party together and split up for a while. Later on I was dancing with a girl, and we found my friend who was dancing with this girls' friend.

"I try to take care of my looks and clothes, I have to be clean shaven for work, and I have a little corgi named Maple. I've been told a few times that people think I'm gay because of these things....

"I love shopping with you, it's just like going with one of my girl friends! Even better, because you pay for things! Here, hold my purse while I try this on."
"I asked my wife to do the same for the same reasons and, to her intelligence, her good health and my fortune for having married her, she started dropping both after doing her business. However, I mean it when I say ""dropping"". She didn't like the idea that she should hold the toilet lid for extended periods of time. She'd move the lid past zenith and let it go. It would **slam** down constantly. She'd wake me up in the middle of the night, embarrass us at parties and make the dog go nuts. I could convince her to close both but to ask her to close them both properly was just a step too far.

Fortunately the repetitive forces ripped the lid off the hinge so I replaced it with a *soft close* seat.

Tl;Dr: Buy a soft close lid *before* asking your SO to close the lid."
The nod.
"I bet you eat that pussy like a retard on bath salts, though! Get em, Tiger!

I was at a busy bar one night and I saw a guy throw an empty cup from pretty far away into the trash can *behind the bar*. It was like when soccer players make a goal by having the ball curve in the air. We made eye contact and gave each other the finger-guns. I was the only one to witness his feat because there was a band that most people were watching.
"I know this isint true for everyone who takes selfies. But to me they can be red flags. Taking a selfie with something ia fine. But 30 selfies in your bathroom that all look the same? Comes across as a lack of self esteem and that you are fishing for compliments. Generally  makes you seem desperate. Also in a relationship i dont want to always have to pose for pics so you get the "" perfect"" selfie. That being said it's their social media. If you want to waste an hour in the bathroom taking 100 identical selfies than knock yourself out. But im gonna unfollow so i dont have to see them"
"My worst enemy in high school saw his mom diagnosed with breast cancer and his sister killed in a car accident in the same week.

Even a sadistic asshole like me couldn't laugh at that level of misfortune. Plus, his mom and sister didn't do anything (literally; his dad was the drunk asshole who turned him into a piece of shit human being, not his mom.)"

The weirdest mid-thrust comment I ever had was woman saying “fuck my white pussy” (and I’m white myself).  Off-topic but this reminded me of it. "
So have you tried like talking to her face to face rather than on a phone. like at the house where she lives...? If you’re engaged to this person it wouldn’t be unreasonable to show up at their house and talk to them
"Endless, baseless suspicion. She would constantly go through my phone, badger me to account for every minute of my time spent out of her sight, and remind me at least once a week that if I cheated she was out. 

And then she cheated on me.
LPT: If you can't trust, you can't be trusted. "
"Some girls have orgasms much easier then others. While I'm sure my own sexual skills improving is a factor, my first girlfriend had a lot of trouble climaxing. My most recent fling came like an overnight FedEx package.

Dude. 
"My dealbreaker are women who have a sense of entitlement. I had a girl recently who flipped out because I wanted to split the bill instead of paying the full price. I figured this was a good compromise since early on in the date the girl was BRAGGING about being independent and how ""She doesn't need a man."" I ask her ""What happened to being independent and strong?"" She just shrugs and says ""I'm independent just not when it comes to dates."""

"3 emotionally abusive relationships in my late teens and early 20s, the last one involving a child. I decided me and my 2-year-old daughter would be better off if I could show her what a household looked like without emotional abuse. I’d completely given up on being in a relationship, was pretty convinced that behind every happy couple was a private life filled with abuse and hatred for each other, and was focused on just being a good dad and nothing more. 

9 months later, I met an incredible woman who had endured almost the same experiences as me (except she was married with a son). Our kids were the same age and she was recently divorced. We fell completely in love really quickly, happy to have found someone else who understood where we’d come from. 

That was almost 9 years ago. We’ve had 2 kids together to add to the mix, and we’ve never imagined life could be this good. After we’d both given up on having what we do, we’re both pretty thankful for the family we’ve made. "
"A guy I hated in school was a really smart and funny guy. He also was good looking and had nice hair. I hated him because I felt he was better at everything I was and do. Even some of my friends liked him better than me. He was funnier and smarter than I was, but I was taller than him with my 6'1 and 5'7 so atleast I had that lol.

I barely had anything on him. 

One day he started getting made fun of having a small penis by one of the girls. Within a few weeks everyone called him shrimp dick, and then another few weeks later he attempted suicide.  

I for once felt awful for him."
"Okay fine. I'll fucking say it.

Once I woke up with our dog licking my morning wood. 

I thought it was my girlfriend until I realized she wasn't even in bed.

Okay. Done. I hated myself. I feel dirty. I'm leaving."
"I think we should exclude sister/sibling comments from this list, or we'll be here all day."
"I've been weightlifting as a hobby for the last 10 years. My wife once asked me: ""Are you swole?"" 

""Honey, if you need to ask...."""
A lot. I want to minimize my risk a lot.
I feel really warm and loved up and really close to her. And like nothing matters except her and me.
"I recently started doing small sets of body weight exercises every night. Pushups, squats, planks, and situps. I do 3 sets of 10 each and while it's not a lot, it's getting me into a routine. I'm feeling better in the two weeks I've done it and will be adding more reps soon. It's just a routine starter for now, but it will build to more soon.

Also I started a face routine and damn, my face looks smoother and cleaner than ever before. It's simple too, I bought a pack of wash clothes so I can use a new one every day. I rinse and then lightly brush my face with the clean wash cloth. I then use a cleanser and an SPF moisturizer. I sometimes exfoliate at night and I'll sometimes put a night cream. 

I dunno I'm 30 now and it feels good to put even a slight bit of effort into my appearance. "
"Running/jogging a mile every day after work. I've never been the most in-shape and active guy, but I actually enjoy running and wish I had started sooner. "
My ex was passive gossip and we discussed alot about the girls in the class. I ended up being nosy af and knowing almost everything about them lol
"In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion."
Holy man I'm sorry to hear that.

I really really want to cuddle with her. Post sex cuddle is my jam.
"Honestly, Kesha.

The more I learn about the #Metoo stuff the more respect I have for her straight up saying no, and suffering the consequences of that choice.  Everyone is talking about the people who feel they dont have a choice, and ignoring those who said no and suffered the consequences.  Those are the ones we should be elevating IMO. The fact that she is not really talked about, or that people are not pushing hard for her career to recover, says something about the dialogue surrounding the movement. "

It usually means they like to drink, but are snobby about it:

* They think preferring wine makes them better than other alcoholics.
* They think it makes them cultured.
* They openly express their need to drink as if it were a result of being a mother - a way of bragging about how hard it is to be a mom. "

"I absolutely used to love the idea of cute, shy girls. But from my experience, they've been incredibly flakey and bail out on wanting a relationship or any sort of commitment. They always happen to talk about going far away and don't know what they want. It's such a turn off. "
well now you have to
"Sisters friend saw a picture of me and used my sister's phone to invite me to come hang out (they were at a bar). It was pretty late and I'd spent all day working and all evening studying and exercising. But I had zero social life and my sister said, ""There's tons of women here"" so I agreed. 

I met like 20 dudes, 2 girls, stayed for about half hour, then left to get taco Bell. On my way back home that girl that had originally pretended to be my sister called me. We texted all night.

"I'm 63.

WTF????

That said, I feel childish sometimes.  Your body changes a lot, inside your head matures in some ways, but in others stays a child.

""Old and gross'?  Wait until your back hurts constantly, your balls hang in the toilet water, your dick shrinks (not that it works that well anyway), you can't hear, you can't see, strange things start growing on your skin, your hair sinks down through your head and starts sprouting out your ears, your nose, and growing up the side of your dick like moss on a tree, your teeth fall out, rain sets your leg to aching, your muscle mass disintegrates, and you can't remember anything.

OMG to be 25 again.

25 is not ""too late"" for anything, except maybe being burped by Mommy.

I do not mean this to be an attack, believe it or not.  

I just want to say, to make it clear, that life is very short, and you need to quit this self-destructive navel gazing and get out there and do it.

Some tough love for you.

Good luck."
"""Hate"" is a strong word. Personally, it takes a lot for me to hate something. 

Also, context matters. Selfie in front of something cool? Awesome. Selfie with new piece of clothing/makeup? Nothing wrong with that.

Posting multiple bathroom mirror selfies? I don't hate it, but it might be a red flag for me. "
Just the word itself.
"Down for strangers and acquaintances, up for friends"
Sounds like your BF needs some space and uses the bathroom as a way to get it.
"speaking as someone who knows quite a few gold diggers. Don't go on expensive dates for awhile (aka ""this place isn't much to look at but fuck their spaghetti is amazing"" and only $10) and try the gift giving sort of test. You text, ""i saw something small while I was out that made me think of you"" and have it be not an expensive gift - even just a silly trinket like a magnet that reminds you of a joke she made or a flower or whatever. It's obviously a very sweet gesture, someone who's in it for the $$ would be expecting jewelry. 

Ask where she wants to go on a date - most reasonable people (unless they have their own money) give a staggered list. Like $10-20/person, $50-60/person and leave it to the other party to decide. If her list is only $50-60 and more / person and she can't afford it - she's thinking with your wallet.

"That's stupid. ""Being a man and going for it"" is a great way to get charged with sexual assault or worse."
"She would tell me her ex was bigger, how he was blessed, she would tell me how her ex fucked her, how he would be able to do certain things to her, but i couldn't (none of which is a turn on for me - since some people are into that). It was a complicated situation that was her going back and forth from me and the ex. 

Have you ever wanted something to work with someone so bad, that your willing to deal with shit? All the pain and bullshit, cause for some reason, you think its going to be all fucking rainbows and kittens at the end of it. That was me, the stress made me lose 30-40 lbs, i lost a friend from it and sometimes, seeing her brings back memories, but i learned a lot from that whole bag of horse shit period of my life. 

Life hasnt been good to her in the present day. She actually didnt end up with me or her ex, rather a dude from her job lol. 

Oh well, i still talk to her cousins, they are good people. 

Sorry for the wall of text.

"I was on my computer, she came over fresh out of a shower wearing only a towel and whispered in my ear ""I want to sit on your face"""
"Badly. It turned out badly. In the end, the child committed suicide. The mother tricked me into getting her pregnant, telling me she was on birth control and allergic to latex. When she turned up pregnant almost immediately, it was ""her body, her choice"". I had papers served on me at work. I had my life ruined and the lives of several others. I paid the child support, but was prevented from having any real interaction with the child. Finally, when the child turned 15, the mother did a complete 180 and wanted me to take custody. I began that process, but it was soon interrupted when the mother accused me of various and sundry crimes, including assault, attempted murder, providing alcohol to a minor, and possession of illegal substances, none of which were even remotely true. So that was the end of that. Several months later, the child committed suicide rather than face the prospect of living with a psychotic mother. Tragic. And I chalk this tragedy up to an imbalance of power. When one side has all the power (her body, her choice) and the other side has none, the situation is ripe for abuse. There are plenty of people out there in the world who view this situation as an opportunity to enrich themselves.

"Took me 3 years to get over my high school sweetheart. Turned out the guy was a narcissist who'd emotionally abused me and cheated on me the entire 4 yrs we were together. We were small town kids, I was a stupid naive girl in love and didn't know the warning signs, and I doubt he knew better either.

He went into the military and was on his way to being a surgeon when he got out. I hated him for his success while I was working whatever job I could get in order to move up in life. 

I have an amazing career and marriage now. My life could not have turned out better. 

Heard from mutual friends last year that he was diagnosed with MS, and is now unable to work - so much for that surgical career. Prior to that the woman he planned to marry to was killed in a tragic accident, she was apparently pregnant. Nobody deserves that kind of loss.

"Dated a woman for 10 years and she treated sex like she was doing me a favor. We'd have sex maybe once a week. She would mostly lay there while I did everything. When she would cum on occasion, she'd just sort or breath heavy and shake. She never acted like it was fun.

With my current gf of 8 months sex is way better. She initiates sex often. We have sex at least 4 times a week and sometimes twice a day. She gets really into it. She lets me know what gets her off and moans and and shakes when she climaxes. She makes sex fun and I enjoy getting her off.  

She also cuddles after sex. I didn't know how much I needed that. I feel so much happier than I did with my ex. 

Yeah it took 10 years to learn my lesson, but lesson learned. Sex should be fun and something you both enjoy.

"Women are taught that men are sex-hungry savages that wanna fuck 24/7 and our value is in how sexually appealing you beasts find us.

Thus, “you don’t want to have sex with me, I am not sexually appealing, I have no value/you do not value me.”

It really isn’t about being unacquainted with rejection, it’s a question of self-worth and self-esteem.

That and being horny definitely makes it harder to, you know, think. Emotions definitely run a bit raw during those moments.

Being sexually rejected as a woman feels a lot like being told you have a weird, tiny penis. If the rejection is coming from your SO, it’s like being told that you have a weird, tiny ding dong but I STILL LOVE YOU AND WILL TOUCH IT LATER WHEN I’M DRUNK, OKAY, HONEY?

It’s hard on the ego.

However, that’s definitely not an excuse to abuse or manipulate someone. 

Boundaries are real.

Edited to add: Any demanding, screaming, deflection, or insulting language used after being sexually rejected is definitely an emotionally unhealthy, insecure woman’s way of trying to get someone to validate her worth or make themselves feel better by making you feel bad.

Much like dudes who call women ugly bitches after they don’t give them their phone number.

It’s bad behavior. Be cool to each other, my dude/ttes.

There is plenty of time in which to fuck any of the many fish that also want to fuck at that same time! SeXxXy"
"That's how planking was invented.

"I agree with this one. It's now my #1 dealbreaker. Excessive social media consumption or needing validation from it, or simply doing something so they can post it on social media.

Dated one girl who would hop on her phone and obsessively check who viewed her stories first thing in the morning right after opening her eyes. I died everytime I had to pose for a perfect photo that highlighted us, the food, the scenery, etc. Or having to reenact for a story. It's not even limited to relationships now. When my friends pull this shit a part of me dies on the inside. "

"We were roleplaying where I chased her around the house and tried to get her clothes off and stuff but she was stronger and faster than me and it was really hard for me to catch her, so she had to go easy on me so I could catch her and put my penis inside her while she feined resistance"
"I wasn't tricked into having a kid with someone, but more of a misunderstanding. I thought she was on the pill, she wasn't. I didn't flat out ask, but I should have. We had only been together for a couple months when we found out we were having a kid. During the pregnancy, we split. I ended up getting transferred out-of-state for work 3 weeks after our son's birth. I visited every three months until he was about 4.5, then I found a new job about 1.5 hrs from where he lives.

My son is my everything. His mom got married as did I in the past year, and we all get along really well. There were never any strong feelings between the two of us, so it makes it a hell of a lot easier to work with one another with raising our son. I now get my son every other weekend and will often drive down on a weekday, pick him up from school, take him out to eat and hang out, then drop him off at his mom's.

I'm very lucky that I have him and a great relationship with his mom."
"Single, attractive, mentally stable. Pick two. "
Men affectionately insulting each other.
"Feelings.

Yeah, sure, they have feelings too, the exact same kind of emotions in fact.

What i find they don't understand is that we experience them in the same way but have a sociological response that often limits our ability to express a good portion of them in the same way women can.

I know for a fact there are plenty of men who feel emotionally weak and really just want to talk, cuddle, or cry. To have their emotions validated and listened to. I also know there are plenty of men who feel that seeking those things out is not an option and they struggle with the fact that they have these feelings but have no outlet for them. 

I've had relationships where my opinion and ""feelings"" were disregarded and generally dismissed because hers were more ""valid'?

There is no difference in the emotional capabilities of men and women, at all. This is clear when you watch young boys a girls and how they respond to their world. However, as they near the teenage years i find that boys tend to start shutting down their emotions in relation to certain things and start to lose that ability to at least cry when upset or hurt. 

After my last relationship i had to accept that i had emotionally closed m off and needed to actively work on how i felt and acknowledging my emotional state, lest i fall into depression again. I'm sure men here can attest to the fact that showing and expressing your emotions is not a viewed favourably, by men or women and that is the resistance i still face.

Society still conditions young men to be emotional rocks and conditions women to expect this. It's stifling our ability to cope with the stresses of life and makes many men incredibly sad but with no ability or resources to seek help.

I genuinely feel women don't get this because they never experience it. Even though they facilitate it's prevalence.

"A toxic personality. I think a lot of women think that guys just don't really notice, and in fact, younger guys often don't. Usually younger guys are more preoccupied with if they can date or sleep with someone, not whether they should. After a while, we wisen up and women who are still on that same old bullshit are silently downgraded. They think they're doing fantastic because their friends still support them, equally clueless women seem to be getting along with their SOs just fine, and they can get laid, so it must be that they're unlucky in love. In reality guys with options, backbone, principle, and/or experience with a fun and stable lifestyle - the kind of shit they want - are disqualifying them from anything serious with extreme prejudice after the high of new pussy wears off.

I've seen it 100 times. She runs guy after guy ragged with hypocritical, self-absorbed, emotionally unstable bullshit, but it's always the guy's fault or they're a victim of circumstance date after date, relationship after relationship."

"I don't think women fully grasp how devastating the word ""creep"" can be.

"A person I know had three enormous opportunities to succeed in life and squandered them all and now lives as a shut in. 

First, he was accepted into a school famous for law but instead of going for law he went for ""East Asian Studies"" because he was super into anime. Obviously this lead to no employment after school. 

So then he decided he wanted to make a certain clothing item (I can't say what it's too personally identifiable) so his parents paid for him to go to a specialty school for two years to learn how to make said item, they then literally bought him an office building, all the equipment needed to make said item, and paid for the production run of said item in China. He sold these items on his horribly designed website that was not professional looking at all. He actually didn't even do a lot of work, he spent most of his day playing WoW (or whatever the MMO was at the time I forget) instead of marketing his brand. He was selling product, but not enough to be sustainable until good fortune struck. 

A national retailer contacted him and offered a chance at selling these items in their store, the retailer (again, can't mention its too identifiable) said they would do a pilot for these products on their website for a month. This person agreed and the day of the pilot, he bitched on his personal facebook page about how unprofessional and irresponsible the retailer was since his product wasn't up on the website immediately. 

Needless to say within *minutes* they called him and cancelled the pilot. His business ended up failing

So then he decides he wants to go into photography. He does it as a hobby but is terrible and refuses to accept any constructive criticism. It's always someone elses fault for not liking his ""work"". Of course, his parents pay for him to go to some high end photography school somewhere where he's not making the grade because he's not listening to what the teachers are saying and he's not working to improve his craft. 

He fails out (all the teachers fault according to him) and now lives at home with his parents and never leaves the house.  "
"Yeah dude, this is a thing.  Remember, for any given woman, you might be the first guy to say no to her.  Women don't initiate as often and men don't reject no-strings sex as often, so it's entirely possible a woman can get to age 30 without hearing ""thanks but no thanks"" from a fella.  AskMen knows, rejection hurts.  And if you're neither used to it nor culturally prepared for it, it shouldn't be surprising that you don't handle it well."
"I'm most likely a minority in the group but I'll say, any obsession with alcohol being projected. If you go to a bar or have a book club and drink wine, cool. Good for you.

"This one is kind of weird, but on days when she gets home before I do there's always a glass of water waiting for me on the counter.  

I had some kind of illness last fall that resulted in enough dehydration to make me pass out twice and go to the hospital.  After that she told me she wasn't going to let that happen again and was constantly on my case to drink more.  Since then it's morphed into both of us getting water for the other depending on who gets home first.  Such a minor thing, but I know she's doing it because she cares.

"A Salvadoran women I met on Bumble. She had a child so we were rarely able to get alone time in bed for the first few weeks. I was extremely patient and caring and careful not to encroach on her parenthood life and make sure I always came second after her kid.

She finally is able to come over alone, and we finally get to do the deed. I ended up being so nervous since it has been so long since I had sex and my last relationship was a horribly toxic sex life,  that I couldn’t get it up at first. 

I said, “don’t worry, this sometimes happens the first time or two until I can fully relax. Just give me a second”.

She immediately looked at me as if I was a ghost. She just got up and stared at me for a good 60 seconds not saying a word. She then got up, spent 5 looking for her clothes (she couldn’t find her shirt for 5 minutes so it was really awkward), and she left. Told me something was wrong with me, asked me if I was gay, and told me she had never been with someone who had that problem. It was the most humiliating moment in my life and I still get a thud to my stomach every time I think about it.

Met a second beautiful Salvadoran a month later and we’ve been together for 6 months and it’s amazing. It ended up happening again when my current SO and I first had sex but she completely brushed it off and thought nothing of it. Had sex a second time, and everything has been fine since."

"There was a bossman at one place I used to work. We all hated him, the guy was a proper douche through and through. The kind of guy that went out of his way to fuck you over, and made sure you knew he was the one who did it. 

One of his kids got in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The kid survived but was a disfigured vegetable, living in a hospital bed in the family's home, full of tubes and stuff. Pretty fucked up, and you could see how the bossman was instantly shattered by it. Like, I know ""shattered"" is an overused word, but it fits. The guy was 100% torn down, broken, hating every second of the situation. His once strong character was turned into this moping, silent zombie. Sometimes we'd catch him crying in his office. Total shell of a person. 

That's some fucked up shit. No matter how much of an asshole he was, it really pained all of us to see him going through that. Not really the way we all had hoped he would get taken down a peg ... his poor kid, his poor family. 

Fuckin' drunk driver."

"That we're emotionless robots who only care about sex. This is both toxic in terms of men's relations with each other (""dude, she can't be just friends with you. You really don't just want to fuck her?"") and with women (who think ""he can't be real friends with me, he just wants to fuck me."")

PS she should have replaced the seat, not you."
"We never get compliments, so stuff like getting cat called or a girl randomly touching us without asking is fucking awesome, because it happens so rarely. The same stuff that infuriates them and they find disgusting can be a massive confidence boost to us.

If the sex sucked, I tend to think ""well, that was...underwhelming..."" then climb off her or pull back off the end of the bed from behind her and put my clothes back on."

"I used to be uncomfortable with the whole topic of menstruation or the products used to deal with it, and I think that's fairly common. Guys are usually either put off by the topic or they're oddly self-conscious about buying these products or hanging out in that aisle.

In my late 20's I had to come to a more adult viewpoint: 1) grow up, 2) get  over it, 3) be a good partner and get her what she needs. It's not that big of a deal to buy feminine hygiene products, but it's a big deal for her to have to go without them because you're being a baby about it."

"A buddy of mine felt that after 15+ years of marriage and kids, he didn't want any of it anymore. He said he felt trapped, that he'd never really lived. His mistress enchanted him, made him feel alive again he said. A year later he regretted the whole thing. He begged his wife to forgive him, to take him back. They're working on it last I heard. Unfortunately, he's now 100k in the hole after lavishing his mistress with gifts including a brand new car.

"I was a lonely, geeky, socially-awkward teenager. I really believed I could never possibly be attractive to women and would die a virgin. I kept thinking that right up until a hot goth girl aggressively pursued and seduced me. It took a lot of aggression an persistence on her part, because my instinct was to assume she was mocking me by pretending to show sexual interest.

But she persisted, took my virginity, and ultimately broke my heart. It didn't end well. But the upside (and yeah, it's a pretty big upside) is that the experience significantly turned around my abysmal self-image. She shattered my illusions about being hopelessly unattractive to women, and I've done okay for myself in the dating/relationship/sex game ever since."

He has 17,000 or so followers, and in nearly every picture/video is a shirtless workout near or on a natural feature (for example, doing push-ups on the edge of a cliff without a shirt on). I can see the insecurity and screams for attention as clear as glass. That also goes for every selfie I have ever seen; even the few that I’ve taken of myself I can see this. "

This question assumes women are attracted to me.

I can't help but feel that a guy asking the same question to women would immediately be labelled a lot of unpleasant things.
"A really high-pitched sort of 'M-Hm!"" meaning affirmation.

It's driving me nuts but I cannot stop. "
I think I'd be flattered.
"Damn i love this woman. Do i really wanna get up and take a piss, is the usual right after. If it was a good session then food is definitely on mind. Why am so lazy that i won't get out of wet spot is another."
How do you decide which penis will open up and accept the other one?
"I don’t know who you hang out with. I’ve never gone shopping with a male friend and expected him to pay for my clothes/items/lunch, and I don’t know a single one of my friends who has done this either. I don’t even expect my boyfriend to buy me shit when I’m shopping. This isn’t normal. "

"So happy it didn't happen to me. My then girfriend wanted (specifically!) three children. This came out of nowhere and was totally unexpected. We had a huge argument about it and she said things like ""okay, so I make holes in the condoms""... I'm happy she hadn't that idea before."
I think the first time I realized that was a thing I did was also after reading some reddit comment about it. It's the strangest thing in the world 'cause I never realized I do it and that those were the rules... I feel like I'm a dog who can't control for whom his tail wags for...

"that men have gemstone colored feathers that we normally keep folded but fan out in display when we're near someone we're attracted to. i, for one, have never fanned out my feathers in front of a crush. that's embarrassing. also, mine's more earth toned if anything. no flashy sapphire blues or emerald greens here."
"Seriously. I've gone shopping with female friends  (they'll tell you what looks good on you) but when they expect me to buy them shit (which happens a lot) I'm pretty firm(but friendly). ""Haha, sorry that s your boyfriends job!"" 


Of course I've gotten dirty looks from saleswomen and waitresses for not paying a female **friends** bill. For all the women who complain about ""Nice Guys"", a lot of them sure get pissy when you don't act like one when it benefits them."

That's heartbreaking. Life is a fucking bitch
"Linda doesn't get drunk, she just has fun."
"That last sentence just made me mad and probably one of my pet peeves. It's just so unfair when a guy has this expectation to pay for things, particularly if the girl actually makes more.

"Most guys aren't bedding multiple women at once, so I am guessing you're basing this off of a few studs and projecting it onto all men. Dudes like that with so many options are able to sample multiple women and choose the best of the lot. I am guessing they feel less attachment because they're spoiled for choice; hard to get attached when there's a dozen other women eager to hop in bed with you."
I'd totally have sex with you to spite her. 
"Pancake ass. Or rather the lack of any willpower to do something about her pancake ass. Let me explain.


The pancake ass wasn't a problem. The problem was that my ex refused to work out or change her diet, but would complain nonstop about her weight. She didn't have a super model figure, but she sure as hell wasn't fat. Instead she resorted to diet pills and ""fasting"".


What really made me leave her was her lack of desire to better any aspect of her life with hard work. She was complacent and resorted to excuses and short cuts to get anywhere in life. "
"I think Malala Yousafzai is incredibly inspiring.  She's the very embodiment of the saying, ""they tried to bury us, but they didn't realize we were seeds.""  After she was attacked for trying to go to school, she not only continued, she is now campaigning for other girls to do the same.  That girl's got some serious guts, strength, and character, and from a much younger age than most people."
Seems like a friend zone comment.

"I've a suspicion that not having sex with a girl might have scared her away.

I had a girl spend the night with me. We were good friends and flirted a bit before, but I'm awkward, low self-esteem, she was beautiful etc. We'd stopped talking when she asked me out and I panicked and rejected her.

So about a year later, she's in town for a birthday and she and another girl mention not wanting to sleep on a friend's couch, so I offer them the spare room because my roommate would be gone anyway. She decides to take me up on it (without telling the other friend).

Anyway, we get home and she decides to hop into my bed and watch some Netflix (Seriously) and I'm happy just to chill and watch some shows. I obviously realise she was trying something, but I was honestly happy to just hang out. Nerves were a major part of it too, but I also just didn't actually want to. I was happy to just cuddle and watch some shows. It was great. Slept awfully but had an amazing night. I was also really sick, but that was mostly in the morning.

Long story short, we had plans to meet up but no date set, and she stopped responding to my messages after about a week. 

It hurt.

Still pretty bummed out, and it actually bothered me so much that I ended up talking to a therapist. Only problem now is that I think about her way too much because I talk about her with my therapist..."
Yeah the first couple times my wife did not handle it very well. And I would turn it down for things like not feeling well or too tired to function. Sometimes I would get home from work too stressed to even think about sex. You really just have to sit down and have an adult conversation with your SO and come to an understanding that yall are not sex robots. After a few times of rejection she realized that its the same thing when she isn't in the mood and so we both respect each other in that sense.

"You wanna drive a guy crazy?  *Appropos of nothing*, give him a little kiss.  Not because he just did something nice for you, not because you're already cuddling, but when you're walking down the street together, say waiting to cross at the intersection, just give him a little *you're sweet* peck.  He will remember that for *years*.  I do.

Men are accustomed to pursuing, but not being pursued, desiring but never being desired, putting their own needs aside to make a woman feel safe and secure.  I'm not saying that's how it should be, but that's often how it is.  That's why an *unearned* kiss can be so powerful and unforgettable."

"My dad’s mom has always treated my mother and me horribly (she had a vendetta against my mother ever since she married my dad and has held the same grudge over me for the sole reason that I look very similar to my mom). She’s said horrible things about both of us and has tried to split up my parents on multiple occasions. My dad has many siblings and his mom is now of old age and has tried to live with each one of them. Each sibling has kicked their mother out because of her horrible negative attitude and my parents decided that she should stay with us. Mind you, we have a quaint 2 bedroom house that’s not exactly tiny but going from 3 people to 4 people is extremely cramped. 

Anyway my dad was in the middle of telling her that she can no longer stay with us because we don’t have the room and I heard her crying and decided to talk to both of them and offer her a couple drawers of the dresser in my room if she’s fine with the cramped space. My dad was going to tell her that he had found some assistant living places that would be a good place for her. She was never nice to me my entire life but the thought of being old and not having anywhere to stay was just terribly sad. So now she is staying at our house indefinitely. I’m not really sure how this is going to go but my love for my dad is greater than the disdain I have for his mother so I’ll try my best to make it work. 

TL;DR my dad’s mom who has hated me my whole life has nowhere to stay and the thought of being old and having nowhere to go was too sad that I told her she could stay with my parents and me. 

Update: after we moved our entire house around and after we had bought her a new bed and a room divider so that she can have privacy, she told my dad she wants to leave because she feels as if she’s unwanted. "
"After dating a couple comedians, I've put a hard moratorium on anyone who does or wants to pursue stand-up comedy or improv. It's not that they're *all* fundamentally bad people but I can't handle the insecurity, attention-seeking, self-loathing, and need to have the last word. Every man I've ever known who does comedy has this awful combination of a huge, incredibly fragile ego and the need to assert that *he* doesn't need a safe space, it's everyone *else* who's a fragile snowflake. I can't stand it. Nobody needs their feelings and opinions tended to and tiptoed around more than someone who gets up onstage and talks about them for a living. Enough. Done with them.

The irony is that my SO now is very good friends with the owner of one of the greatest comedy clubs of all time and we're literally watching the Super Bowl at his house - we hang out socially with Birbiglia, Roy Wood, Aziz, all these guys. But I will never ever date a fucking comedian again."

"Getting hit in the balls isn't like stubbing yuor toe, biting your tongue, or even closing your fingers in a door. It's much much worse.

You see, our balls are a part of us, our constant companions. They are our genetic legacy. To be hit in the balls is to be made painfully aware of not just great immediate pain, but also the risk that maybe our line will end with us. We will fight to the death for our balls, for losing them is the same as death.

To hit a guy in the balls is the greatest existential threat to a man there is."

Worst thing about it is that good channels producing work that took 2+ weeks to make have now all been destroyed by youtube's algo, which favors spam videos where people just talk into a camera for 30 minutes."

"Selection bias. Out of nearly 4 billion men in the world I'm betting most just toss it in with the rest of the shopping and call it a day, maybe nowadays texting some pictures back and forth because they change the goddamn packaging on that stuff every 3 days.

"I could talk for days, but let me put it this way:

1. Horses are very fragile animals who seem to spend the majority of their life sick or injured. One day she forgot to feed her horse in the afternoon, and the damn thing nearly died. Between the sicknesses and self-inflicted injuries, she got to ride the thing like twice a month. Hell, the stables once forgot to feed the horses for ONE night, 1 horse died due to some digestive issue that can apparently occur because of this, and another 3 nearly died because of it. ""Hearty"" is not a term I would use to define horses.

2. Horses are REDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE.  The cost of the stable, shoeing, and the constant medical work, she was paying nearly $1000 a month to care for this animal. She was nearly broke trying to pay for this thing.

3. Horses are dumb and skittish animals. Step on a branch, start a car, open a door, fill the feed bucket too loudly, and they freak out and bounce around until they injure themselves.

Heaven forbid though that you mention any of this to a horse owner, or suggest that if you are barely able to afford food for yourself, that maybe you shouldn't own a horse.

Nah, instead she took out a loan to buy a $6,000 saddle so she could start ""showing"" her horse. According to her, she could make a healthy profit at these competitions and would pay off the loan in no time.  Due to injuries and sickness though, she never was able to show her horse, and defaulted on her loan.

looney man.

That type of shit, we all dreaded standing post with the guy or basically any forced contact. You basically had to be on Heroin to stand more then 5 minutes with him.

We found him the next day wired to a tree cut a few hundred times and covered in burns, he reeked of urine.

"Funny story time. Took a girl out on a date. She was in med school. She bragged about how much money she would be making once she finishes. And I do mean bragged.

Like she asked me what I did and I told her I was in school to get my MBA and she responded ""oh that's easy, anyone can do that. It's actually hard work to become a doctor.""

Yea i know, I should have just left there, but I thought at the very least I wait this date out because she may say more things to tell an interesting story to my friends. And she didn't disappoint.

Check comes and I suggest we split it. She looked at me like I was crazy. Said ""what kind of gentleman are you? The guy should always pay."" then she looked at the waitress and said ""can you believe he didn't offer to pay?""

Now depending on the mood I'm in, sometimes I'll pay. But I chose not to pay because I only ordered one Miller lite. She ordered a full fucking dinner plater and a drink.

My tab was only $3.00 while hers was $18. So on that alone why would I pay?

I told her this and she responded ""well I didn't eat all of it and you were welcome to some.""

Despite being the initiator he always played the victim card though. He dropped out of school, and I didn't care. I later found out that his dad became really sick with some sort of cancer. Maybe this is why he behaved like a tosser.

Anyway, his dad survived. I messaged him and apologised that we didn't get along, and that I hope he is fine.

A while later we were playing against each other in a football game. My dad had died about 5 months before, and in a small town, he certainly would've known this. He didn't say anything, he didn't shake my hand at the end of the game, nothing. In fact, he made several attempts to try to injure me when the ball was nowhere near us.

I check homework, she makes lunches,  we both do laundry.  I cook, she does dishes.  I clean the bathroom, she dusts and vacuums.   We're tired, but neither of us really stressed too much or exhausted because we parent as a team.  All the dads I know and I'm my family are equall contributors."
You are a good man
I was hoping to see more of this tbh.
I can relate.  I was on a first date at a fancy steakhouse (this was about 10 years ago but I imagine it will stick with me for at least 10 more) and my date and waiter start striking up a conversation about places they like around town.  I had just graduated college a year before and they were both in college.  So they are talking about what college bars they go to on what nights and then she tells him she’s going to “AJ”s (this shitty college bar that had 80’s themed music on their second floor that was made of wood and would literally sway and bounce.) tonight and that he should come check it out.  My invite must have got lost in the mix.  I dropped her off after dinner and never texted her again.  A few months go by and she texts me with “heyy stranger” Nope.

"I work in RE development and so my company owns the building where our office is. Three offices share two bathrooms in a common hallway. Since most of the employees of the three offices are men, my boss decided to make the bathrooms unisex. They're both private, single toilet bathrooms. Anyways the ladies in the office across the hall were so upset. One woman said to me ""men not only don't put the seat down but they also try to pee with the seat down and pee all over it. I have boys at home, i know how it works"". She literally thinks men are animals that piss on the same seats that they also sit on because she has a lazy 8 yr old at home. Fucking insane. "
"By way of apology, FWB snuck in thru the pet door and laid on my bed naked to wait for me while I was in the shower.

"'give up' might be a little extreme, but I was definitely getting to the point where I was losing faith that I would ever end up with a woman I wanted to marry (and who wanted to marry me).

Part of what made me start to lose faith is that I was struggling with dating at a time when I should have been doing the best: I was in my best shape and most financially successful.  Lo and behold, I met my fiancee when I was definitely not at the apex of either of those categories.

So one of the things I feel like I learned is that, to a large degree, finding a successful long-term relationship is largely random, because your personalities need to click.  That being said, you can drastically increase the chances of it happening by meeting new women and not giving up hope."
Unless the toilet creates an airtight seal....shit doesnt matter...literally
"There's a good chance he's into your girlfriend. When I got engaged to my now-wife, one of her guy friends that very obviously harbored a long-time crush on her tried to convince her to postpone the wedding. In my case it was just kind of hilarious/sad, but in this case it seems to be fucking with your psyche a bit. Definitely worth a conversation with her, just keep your tone very non-accusatory and tell her how you feel."
"I wish guys would slow down during sex. But if I ever tell them to slow down they maybe do so for five seconds before jackhammering, cumming, and then being done. Why can't guys care more about women's pleasure too? Sex is so male focused and I hate that. I'll probably get downvoted for saying that on a male dominated sub but it's true. "
"Kind of an odd one, and it might just be my awful music taste at play.

I have a workout music playlist. I'd imagine a lot of people do. Whenever I compare it to another man's playlist, I totally get his choices. Even if I might not like x song or musician, I totally see why he would include it here, and they say the same when they see mine.

Whenever I take a look at a woman's workout/motivational playlist, I am just left baffled by some of the choices. And they are almost always similarly baffled by mine.

Just an odd little thing I noticed about a fairly specific thing."

"My long-time friend had to pay $795 per month per kid (for two kids until independent) plus $4500 per month in alimony for life. After about a decade of this he offered her a buyout. She accepted. He had to mortgage his house but in the long run it saved him close to $300k. He has since paid off the mortgage and is now putting away all that for retirement. But best of all, he longer has any connection, financial or otherwise, with her anymore.He's glad to finally be rid of her."

"I guess its true for what dating profiles say in terms of girls loving their dogs more than you.  

For me oddly enough is just moving too fast on the first date. I would've never considered it until it ended up fucking me over when I fell fast in response and she broke it off a month later. I'm not the type to question the pace if she wants it, but the problem is catching feelings and being misled in to thinking it was something bigger. Kind of want to put a safety buffer.

On a more trivial note? Being too picky on menu items. The last date kept going on about which item on the menu is good, then I'd agree, then she say,  ""but no, you should try something else. Howabout this?"" ""Um. Okay"". 
""Or this? But howabout this?""  

I wouldn't have considered it as a dealbreaker because I never came across it. And I found it terribly annoying. "

"First of all, we didn't have ""the sex talk"" with the kids because one talk isn't enough to teach everything that they need to know, while also keeping things age appropriate. 

Anyway, we had several sex talks with the kids. It was more awkward for them than for us. Approach was direct, but age-appropriate (a.k.a. need to know basis). For instance, when they were little, they needed to know where babies came from. When they were a little older, they wanted to know how the babies got inside of uteruses. When they were older, contraception, sex for pleasure, sex drive, STIs, consent, emotional aspects, porn is different from real-world sex, when you ask for birth control the answer is automatic ""yes"" without judgment, etc. 

Kids need to know very different aspects at different ages. And yes, it was awkward for them, because they need the information prior to their wanting to actually have sex! Also, parents have already been puked on, shat on, pissed on, by their kids. We've watched them throw complete 5-alarm tantrums in the public frickin' library. It's a little hard to embarrass us after all that shit."
"I have a close (24m) friend who this happened to. His then girlfriend of 6 months said she was 'on the depo shot' but got pregnant. They had a shotgun wedding before she got too big, and thier daughter is three now. They've been seperated four times since and he always sleeps on the couch. He tells me all the time how he wishes he could leave her, but he absolutely loves his daughter and is afraid that he won't be able to see her anymore if he does. 
It sucks."

My most satisfying sexual partner was definitely below average on both length and girth. He was a fucking magician with his fingers and tongue, and he could get really rough without bruising my damn cervix. From what I've heard from other women in my life, they've all had similar experiences. Men who were packing less ended up being way better about getting them off as well.


Teens can be cruel and typically don't have much experience in that area. I'm always surprised when I hear adults make that joke."

"My best friend has dreamt of emigrating to Japan all his life. He speaks good japanese and his last real job was tech support in japanese for a global company with full benefits and great pay. He was comfortable on that job, but one week the company decided to shut down his service center and lay everyone off. He gets a very large severance payment (roughly equivalent to 18 months pay). 

Instead of taking the money and following his dream, he uses it to move in with his girlfriend of less than year, who is 10 years older, has two kids and is used to a very high standard on living due to her father being very, very rich. Less than a year later he has to move out in the middle of the night due to the unbearable state of their relationship.

He burnt through his severance payment AND got in a lot of debt in his time with that girlfriend, and now can't find a job. He drives Uber and struggles to keep up with his debt while crashing at different people couches in a rotation."

"It actually has more to do with the different shape of male and female pelvises. Because the pelvis has a different shape in men and women, the natural angle at which the legs come off is different, and men’s legs tend to be more comfortable when more spread out. It’s not really due to the testicles, since it’s possible to put your legs together without crushing them. "

"Can absolutely relate. It's, like you said, nice in the beginning/endearing but it wears ya out quick. For my experience, insecurity started rearing it's head with my ex, and I didn't realize the emotion sucking power of always trying to accommodate or watch what I said around them. It's weird because I noticed my own general demeanor going down and wasn't sure why. However, it made me realize I needed to get my emotional reserves back up, how uncomfortable I was being around them, and to work on myself some more. I was really upset with myself because I compromised on my own ideas/beliefs/values and got burned in the end.

Edit: One more thing to add...I started exhibiting the exact same behaviors she was using on me because I did not have the fortitude or reserves built up to push back on what she was doing to me. It's scary. If you don't assert boundaries or have reasonable limits on things, you start to turn in to a ""relationship chameleon"" and things tend to go awry from there. 

Edit 2: I forgot to mention, she did me the favor of breaking up."

"Back in the ancient times (first dot-com boom) several of my friends made it big - like $10,000,000+ big.  One was worth more than $100,000,000 before he was 30.

I don't recall it ever being an issue.  You have to work hard at becoming wealthy - it's all consuming.  They were the same non-dating, no life guys after the fact.  When they slowed down and had time to date, I don't think it ever came up or was a factor.  They didn't really have the trappings of wealth - they didn't have time to buy much and weren't that interested anyways.  

They all got married eventually - that's when their wives realized exactly how rich they were.   One went house hunting in atherton and paid cash - I still remember her reaction when she realized he wasn't kidding when he said he'd take the house.  She thought they were just window shopping and was expecting them to be stuck in the same little condo.   

Only thing I see different after 20+ years is that they tend to fly private and collect houses."

"Taking a fiber supplement and a men's multivitamin everyday. 

First off the increase of fiber, for the first week or so, was pretty rough. Once my body got used to the fiber, I was taking the most glorious shits I've ever taken in my life and quite honestly everything improved with it, including my overall sense of wellbeing and happiness. 

I honestly didn't think that taking a men's multivitamin would do any noticeable difference in the way I felt. I was surprisingly wrong and since taking it every day I have a new found energy and I'm not so sluggish anymore.

"If she wants to cum and I don't want to have sex, that seems like a reasonable solution."
"Definitely listen to this advice. The grass is always greener on the other side. I’m 24, I never went to a college like all my friends (I go to school online). I joined the navy at 19, I got married when I was 20, divorced just before 23, moved to multiple states, have lost and gained countless friends and dated many many women in the last year and a half. All my friends went to college and partied in frats and slept with women or met their girlfriends. It’s not all that it’s cracked up to be. 

Everyone moves at their own pace and everyone sees thing differently. The experiences you’ve had in your life put you down a specific path. All you have to do is figure out where you want to go and work your ass off to get there. You can do it. 

Focus on you and only you and when the time is right, friends will wander into your life and the right woman will too. Figure out what you want the most and go for it, if it’s your dream, don’t give it up. 

I lost lots of friends right before the new year and my brother dragged me to grab drinks with some people we went to high school with and their friends right before the new year (i did NOT want to go). I’ve been spending every weekend with them and they tell me all the time they are so glad we met and that I’m part of the group now. Something I never really had because all my other friends were fake as hell. I’m so grateful for it but if I went out and looked for it I would just find superficial people. Same goes for women. 

Do you, build a life you want and when the time is right, everything else you need with fall into place. Remember, the grass is always greener. "

"One of my exes called me freaking out because he and his girlfriend had gotten into a massive fight after he found out she cheated. Her excuse was that she needed to cheat because his dick was way too small to satisfy her. So he calls me to verify whether or not he is satisfying in bed. I would NEVER tell any man he has a small peener because that's a quick way to fuck someone up for life. I told him that he was satisfying and really good at other stuff and if that wasn't enough for her then that was something they needed to work out in their relationship. He DOES have a smallish dick, but no way would I tell him that. That's a bitch move.

Edit: ps they broke up, she blamed me (NOT her cheating) and sent ME a long crazy person message on FB about stealing her man when I had a boyfriend and wasn't even trying to get back with that ex."

"I mountain bike and while the male-female ratio in the sport is highly skewed, I do occasional come across a lone female rider.  If it's a guy, I may be inclined to stop and chat.  A woman?  Unless I know them, I keep on rolling.  If I see them repairing something on their bike, of course I ask if they're OK and if they say ""yea""...Cool....have a good ride.  

Last year, I was riding at this one park that I hadn't been too in a while and saw a new trail head but I rode on past it as I didn't know where it went.  I saw another rider up ahead of me so I caught up and realized it was a woman.  I was tempted to ride by and not ask but I REALLY wanted to know where that trail went.  So I pulled up along side and said hi.  She said Hi back and after a moment I asked if she knew.  She did and told me.  I said great and thanks!  Hope you have a good ride and went on ahead.  If this would've been a guy, I would've chatted with him for a bit but not wanting to creep her out and make her feel threatened, I kept it short and rode on.  

Sucks but that's just the way it is.  "
"I never expected to have a philosophical conversation with someone I was dating about what ""being exclusive"" means. For example, it doesn't mean you get to date other people, make out with them, and have sex every possible way that wasn't PIV and we're still exclusive. What are you, Bill fucking Clinton?

No, girl I'm no longer going to sleep with, you don't get to talk about every aspect of my body and our sex life with all of your friends in public at a party. We're not in high school, FFS.

No, you don't get to move in with me after we've gone out a couple times because you lost your job.

No, I'm not going to fix your car/computer/budget/refrigerator/hot water heater just because we've dated a few times. There's people to fix those things, and those people are not me.

No, your music sucks. Go ahead and like it, but that doesn't mean I'm going to start listening to it because we're sleeping together. Same goes for whatever fashion sense you think men look good in, or how to decorate my place, or how I spend my time.

No, I'm not shaving my beard for you.

No, I'm not 'proving' to your daddy that I'm an OK guy. I'm in my 30's, making good money, and a decent human being. I don't care about his approval.

I don't care how much you want to get married, I'm not having this conversation with you on our first date.

No, I don't care if you hit on other guys on our date. Just don't expect me to stick around, of fucking course I'm just going to get up and leave. No, don't call or text me after trying to 'explain' yourself.

No, I don't think baby talk is cute. I think it's fucking creepy.

No, if all your ex's are assholes, that doesn't mean all men are assholes. I'm not going to defend being a man to you. I am however going to suggest that the common theme is in fact you, and to question your logic in asking me out if you think all men are assholes. And yes, I'm out of here, you get the check.

No, the patriarchy doesn't force women to shave their body hair. Don't shave it, I don't care, but don't tell me I'm repressing you when I think hairy legs and armpits are a turn off and don't want to have sex with you any more.

No, it's not funny when you borrow my car and return it with a fucking dent. Pay for it.

"Lifting.  I've been going a little over six months, and now that I've lost weight, the muscle is starting to look pretty good.  Definitely getting noticed more by the lady folk.

"&gt; we've been socialized not to complain, because it sounds like entitlement

Yeah, these days even mentioning that you're slightly bummed that things didn't work out with a girl is considered ""entitlement"":
&gt; 
&gt; *Man: Man, I thought we had a thing with this girl but then she stood me up.*
&gt; 
&gt; *Woman: Wow, you're so fucking entitled. It's not like she owes you sex or anything, you tool.*

Don't get me wrong - entitled Nice Guys™ are thing, but not every man is one of them."
"I'm not a guy (I hope it's okay that I'm responding here, I just thought this was important and a great thing to ask), but my advice would be to do your best to help boost her self esteem. Make sure to compliment her on the things she does well, ask her what she dreams of doing when she grows up and then tell her that you will do anything to help her get there because you believe in her and to let you know if there is ever anything you could do. Small comments that seem to come from nowhere and are not obviously being said as ""you're awesome *so you don't need to seek approval from guys*"" kind of thing because teenagers tend to resent being protected or not being treated as adult as they feel. When we are not expecting compliments our defenses are down and we tend to absorb the compliment and feel it before we have a chance to throw up our walls. 


As for a more hands on approach, maybe tell her that even though you are her guardian you are first and foremost her big brother and if life had been fair and she had stable parents that being siblings is all you would have been and that would have meant that you were more like friends who would give advice and keep secrets and that you want her to think of you as a brother first and know that it will always be safe to talk to you. 

You know how some very smart parents will offer a pass when it comes to drinking as long as it is done responsibly? Apply the same conditions when it comes to alcohol and drunk driving where you make your kid a deal and say *""You should not be drinking and no you are not allowed... BUT IF YOU DO always always always call for a ride home, no matter what time it is or how drunk you are, always call. If you do that I promise you will not be punished because it is THAT important!""* 


The same thing can be applied to sex and dating like this:


*I don't want you to think that I approve of or am encouraging you to be sexually active or to date, but if and when you do I want you to feel like you are able to talk to me no matter what. If you have questions, if something happens, if you need to see a doctor or want to start birth control, or even if you need condoms, please tell me. Of course I would rather you wait until you are a bit older, but that is only because I know that you are too good for most boys your age and they are not worth your time, but ultimately it's up to you and only you can know if you feel ready then I will respect that. 


If you FEEL ready, and you are being SAFE, as long as you are not choosing to have sex in order to get something out something (like having a sex with boy to make sure he likes you or wont flirt wirh other girls, or to be popular, etc.) Then there is no reason to keep it a secret. There is nothing to be ashamed of, and my concern is not whether or not you are having sex or spending too much time with boys, my only concern is that you are safe and happy when you do and that stay safe and happy. 


Part of being mature enough to be ready for sex and relationships is being able to talk about sex and relationships like adults.*


The one thing my mother said to me that really helped at that age was *""Only you can know for sure if you are ready to have sex, I can't decide that for you, so when it happens is up to you because ultimately you are the only one that has to live with that decision. The most important thing and all I want for you is that once you have done it that you will be able to look in the mirror and respect yourself afterwards. If you can feel GOOD about it afterwards then that is what matters.* 

This changed my way of thinking when it came to sex, and the more I thought about it the more I realized that I had yet to meet a boy in school that was worth my virginity, and that made it easy to wait until I was ready and felt good about why both my partner and I each wanted to do it for the right reasons and avoid being pressured. I learned to get a feeling of self worth out of respecting myself and deciding that I deserved better than some dumb jock player. It wasn't about what the guy thought or my parents thought, it was about what I thought when I looked in the mirror the next morning. 


The best way to determine whether or not if you will feel this way afterwards *before* you do it is to ask yourself *""even if it never happens again, even if he and I don't end up dating either in the short term or long term, that even if the sex is the only thing that happens between us that I won't regret it even if I don't ""get anything"" out of it in the end""*

"Guy I knew was possibly a certifiable genius, got a 34 or 35 on his first ACT without trying, had wealthy parents, he could have done anything he wanted, and took it 100% for granted.
