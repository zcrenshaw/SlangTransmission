"&gt; Ah, well OK then. I'll assume the problem is on your end.

I mean, he's not wrong."
I'd say demand another party being present in that employee review. $HHR doesn't sound impartial right now.
"&gt; When $boss came to the office later that, he sits down with $clickity telling him how irresponsible $clickity was and how he can't let it happen again.

The words ""then fire me"" would probably have left my mouth if I were in that situation. Just fire me so I can get unemployment and get to tell the story of why I was fired at every interview I go to after I walk out that door."
Ho. Lee. Fuhhhh...That review was blatantly retaliatory. Quite hostile. The kind that requires the state and a lawyer or to to get involved.
Echoing this. Revealing medical info to other parties with no reprimand should be a big flag.
"I'd like to have an ISP of that kind.
They seem to be really nice"
"If I remember correctly, he started looking for new jobs later that week. "
My favorite TL;DR here so far.
I was honestly not expecting it to be tech support screw up. 
"You were lucky, I have an Executive Secretary demand that I come out and change the toner in her Laser Printer because she was too important to listen to the ""FREE"" instructions I would give over the telephone.

Went out, pull out the old toner, unboxed the new toner that was sitting right beside the printer, inserted it and did some test prints.

I spent more time walking from my car and up the stairs than I spent on the printer.

Then she complained about the bill that had one hour travel time built in and one hour min. on site PLUS 15% taxes. (This is Canada after-all)."
"I imagine EVPIT feeling like he was dealing with teenagers.

No insult intended, you showed him you care and will fight for your workers. HHR showed she is an idiot who will make mountains out of nothing and is vindictive."
"Another party completely disconnected from your department, so they can't claim bias or anything."
"Doesn't surprise me. This seems like textbook case of ""employees join companies and quit bosses""."
"Mine just called after about a month of &gt;99% upstream utilization to ask if:
  * We know about it
  * We want to upgrade
  * What the fuck is going on"
"Id specifically request the EVPIT as he listened to the call, he's important, and he understands it... hopefully. The problem with q completely unrelated party is they may not have knowledge of it and could side with hr without understanding the situation at play"
"Yep, HIPAA violation right there. And if there is proof of that being said time to seek outside council. Especially after a retaliatory review it won't matter if it is an at-will state."
I can imagine that tech was tickled AF to be able to say that for once. 
"Walk into the meeting with a big shit eating grin. They might look confused.

Explain you assumed they brought the meeting forward to discuss how your exemplary performance and due diligence saved the company from wrongful termination of an innocent employee with all the legal ramifications that has.

Oh and definitely request an impartial observer. Preferably VPIT."
You were supposed to pour her files into the new monitor before giving it to her. what kind of IT PERSON ARE TO NOT KNOW THAT ? LOL
"Yeah, you needed to escalate at ""It's a website... You handle tech support for the website.""

The response: ""Okay, I need to escalate this, some one will call.""

Your escalation point is the Security organization.  No one crawls up HRs ass like Security.

* ""So, can you show me the contract?""
* ""Where is the SOC2?  Where is the security review?""
* ""Does this site comply with EU privacy rules?""
* ""What data did you give them?""
* ""Is it integrated with Single-sign on?""

We pay your salary! You should help me with my YouTubes and Instagrams
no consequences for HR = you will suffer again
SIR I HAVE TOLD YOU I'M NOT A COMPUTER PERSON
...what the fuck *is* going on?
"They are running the ultimate Bee Movie script: Bee Movie, but everytime the word bee is encountered, a new thread is created running the Bee Movie script. "
Spoiler alert: $U and $HHR are the same person.
"Because we IT people get into the business to steal the important stats on toilet paper usage.
"
"They forgot the very first, most basic instruction.

""Hello IT, have you tried turning it off and on again?"""
And a toxic person like that as head of HR will rot the company from the inside out. They are a cancer and the sooner they are cut out the better.
"That’s the exact reason I’m sitting outside an office for a job interview right now. I love my company, and I love my job, but my boss is such a busybody that if I ever have any downtime he’s yelling at me for being unproductive. It’s a cell phone repair store, we get rushes and slow times. I’ll be so happy to get out. There’s one other employee and he’s already said when I leave he leaves, so the store will be left without a staff. Just because one guy can’t deal with an “unproductive” staff when it’s slow. "
Imagine being so computer-phobic that it's easier to *fly someone in* instead of clicking through a damn installer.
"Seen this with Japanese devices in the UK before, some wifi frequencies aren’t available in every country. (Channels 150ish plus are spectrum reserved for something else in Japan, okay for 5ghz wifi in UK)
Some devices seem to set what channels the wifi will listen and transmit on based on the location set, so it’s possible the network in question was using broadcast frequencies that are reserved for something else in Russia?"
"I second this. Reach out to EVPIT, and ask him if he could sit in on the review in light of this, and the HR move to the change in your review. "
"That's **Customer Service**

Then they were sold to national ISP and internet was shit forevermore."
"A) Good on you for actually doing due diligence and making sure your tech isn't getting thrown under a bus. This happens more rarely than it should, sadly.

B) Fingers crossed that you're not the one getting hit by the bus instead. I echo the below sentiments that you should request a neutral third-party be present during said review."
"&gt; $newBoss: And I have to fill out every field I request?

The Holy Light of Understanding did at last Dawn across the land, and the Evil came to realize that it had made only a Rod for thine Own Back. And Thus did the Evil immediately set about tearing down thy Rod to the barest whisper of the original machinations, and henceforth was all put to rights throughout the land."
"HR people like this are a menace. My very first job in IT we got a new HR director two weeks after I started. The boss was out that day but had already run me through a new user setup and orientation not taking into consideration that she would need more software and help than an average user. I tired my best to help her then eventually explained that I was new and still had limited knowledge and that my boss would be in the next day to help her. This woman commenced to berating me for a solid 30 minutes about how ridiculous I was, how her old IT staff would have never been this incompetent, and how unprofessional it was to tell a manager that I would not help them. 

I was damn near in tears by the time she finally let me out of her office and she promptly sent the IT Director an email complaining about me and recommending termination. After I managed to recompose myself in the bathroom, I walked into the IT Directors office, explained what had just happened, and appologized profusely. He mentioned her email the stated he had already scheduled a meeting with her and her boss to discuss the proper way to treat employees. She ended up fired less than a year later. "
"[Company health plans](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/index.html) are a HIPAA covered entity.  If OP’s company is self funded (most large companies are) then they are absolutely a covered entity.  It could be debatable depending on whether the medical information came from claims records or a form submitted for leave, but it was still a very bad idea for that HR person to bring that up.  Even if what she did wasn’t a HIPAA violation, it still opens the company up to a lawsuit and potential criminal investigation. "
"No, this where I pointed out that we were the local authorized repair center for all their laser printers and that if the bill was not paid we would:

A) Not come out to do any other services calls and since they were a large company there would be others.

B) We would explained the reason why we would not come out and who refused to pay.


She paid!"
"&gt;Actors in this play are as follows. This happened yesterday by the way. Today's events will be posted tomorrow.

Dang it.  Can't you post tomorrow's events yesterday instead so I can read it now?"
"&gt; $EVPIT – Thank you $hit. So you do need to show her some respect…that being said. $HHR? He is right. You violated company policy, you tried to terminate an employee when it was not called for, and you created a mountain out of a single email. (Turning to me) Do you want to keep your job?

I'm sorry, but why exactly? I work at a small company, here, respect is earned from *EVERY TIER* of management and worker alike. If you act an ass, you're regarded as an ass. And if you act a child, you're treated as one.

HHR made a dumb mistake, tried to **FIRE SOMEONE** for the sake of nothing but her fragile ego, and walks away with an apology? That's someone this business wants representing their human resources division? Holy shit the bar is low in your workplace.

Still, excellent story."
"Technically correct, the best kind of correct."

"I deployed a prefilled off-site backup server and forgot to add the spares as spares to the RAID 6+0. Instead I created the RAIDs with one disk more each.

I had to refill 45 disks over a 100Mb/s link, because it was a dedicated fiber not even traffic prioritization was required. The alternative would have been to move a 4U shelf full of disks twice."

Now *that* is how you maliciously comply with a request.
"He's also the owner and he is insanely cheap. Hiring someone else means money to be spent. One time, he didn't want us to turn the lights on in our office because that cost money. Thankfully, our HR person told him that was illegal under the country's labor laws."
"Almost certainly not HIPAA unless he works for a medical provider/other covered entity.  Most employers are not bound by HIPPA.  So definitely not a nice move, but probably not illegal."
"&gt;I’m sitting outside an office for a job interview right now. 

Good luck!"
"They all regard her as an ass, but in a professional environment you don't curse at co-workers, especially in a meeting. 


Having said that, definitely fuck anyone who thinks their position makes them immune from backlash at being a tool. EVP should have phrased that differently. It's not ""don't curse at management again or your fired"" it should be more along the lines of  ""everyone is expected to behave civil at work""


Don't get me wrong I would have reacted very similarly had such a thing happened to me but I get why he felt the need to make sure everyone was cordial with each other. Drama in the work place is always bad for business."
"Honestly, at this point, I'd say the blame is now on the Director for not telling anyone else about what they approved. Unless there's an established (documented) approval procedure in place that was not followed, it's not really HR's fault."
I think you just created a new ransomware virus.
