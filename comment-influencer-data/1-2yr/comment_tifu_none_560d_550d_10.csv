Why cant you people on reddit just masturbate normally
"Im just picturing your mom walking into your room, seeing you bump into the wall screaming murder and flailing your arms around, and thinking to herself ""I wish he was just masturbating like a normal boy"""
"You can use a throwaway all you want, but your dad still saw you fucking a couch."
I wish he'd fuck our leather couch instead.
"From the title I was really interested in hearing how you convinced someone they were dead. ""Like dude, you're a ghost now."""
"Regardless of the throwaway account, you'll be known as the Couch Fucker, mate."
"Six hours talking to a girl you find yourself increasingly enamoured with, and only made a plum of yourself the once? You're doing okay bud. Nobody got punched for a boundaries failure - it's ok. üôÇ"
I wonder how long your friend's been in therapy
At least you werent caught by your dad fucking a couch.
"&gt; He walked back out but before he shut the door, he said ""don't clean that; im throwing it away, now."".

NO YOU CAN'T! WE'RE IN *LOVE!*"
"Yeah! Use a coconut like the rest of us!

Edit: Yay! I now have a whole bunch of Internet points!"
Wait. You vomit when you cry? That‚Äôs the real story here. 
Op treats objects like women!
Must have been a pull out couch.
"Several years ago I watched a kid back out of a parking space to start his driving test. (He was parked in a space marked for driving tests, and a woman with a clip board got in the passenger side). 

Instead of pulling straight out of the space, he had the wheel turned. The front of his car smashed right into the Cadillac parked in the space to his right. 

I watched as he tried to correct, but continued backing out, doing more damage. Watched the woman gesturing wildly to turn the wheel. I saw him straighten out and pull back in. The woman jumped out and went marching into the DMV. He put his hands on his head in disbelief. 

The whole thing is burned into my memory as one of the most soul crushing moments I‚Äôve witnessed. 

So if it‚Äôs any consolation, OP, it definitely could be worse. "
"Immersive reality.

I get the feeling this isn't the last TIFU that VR gives us."
Sofia and I are getting married! 
Ahem. Our *very expensive and luxury $700.00 leather couch* thank you very much.
Holy shit I wish you showered with me. 
"I‚Äôm amazed your dentist agreed to do that. Seems like a terrible idea, what if you started twitching around?  
  
Edit: twitching at the dentist is my pet nightmare. I always envision the pick or drill slamming through my tongue or into my brain."
"When you're older and have to buy expensive furniture for yourself, you'll be grateful that the awkwardness was the only thing that happened. Pouring dish soap on my leather couch? I'd go apeshit. So, good on your dad for not losing his shit."
This is one of the most uncomfortable things I‚Äôve read in a while
"My guess -- she was flirting and potentially interested if you crossed paths during the week with her friends, but didn't want to kiss a stranger on a plane. So you probably came off a little too thirsty, and now she'd rather not deal with it and just see her friends without distraction. That's perfectly fine. At most you missed out on a chance later on, but realistically this feels like a best case scenario where you both would've enjoyed the chat but never realistically met up again anyway."
"Build twelve bridges, save 100 people, and fuck one couch, no one remembers you as a bridge builder or a life saver. They remember you as a couch fucker. Sorry buddy. "
"Some things of this rough nature kinda have the ability to turn into something you laugh about a few years down the line, but this will never be okay. "
Legends say he's still there.
"I thought the real story was the phrase ""human hospital."""
"Some people don't buckle their seat belt and fail as soon as they put the car in gear so I mean

My tester showed up 20 minutes late in sweatpants and passed me even though I absolutely botched the parallel park."
I would have called their corporate office right then and there and put in a specific complaint about how I a paying guest was treated by the managmenet because I filled out a survey hoenstly so they could improve their offerings.
"Reads title.

&gt;Haha, that's a a funny typo. Obviously he means ""fucking on my dads couch.""

Reads story.

&gt;... Oh."
"I have a similar story. I used to travel to the same city each week for business. It was a new, 3-star chain hotel. After 3 or so months, I received a ‚Äúcompletely anonymous‚Äù survey by email. Stupidly, I answered it.

My review was an 8 out of 10, which I thought was good. Mostly pros about the friendly manager and staff, who always took good care of me. I had a couple of complaints about the quality of the breakfast, where I mentioned the frozen danishes (which were often still cold after reheating) and gritty eggs that I thought might be powdered. 

The next week, I checked in late at night. The manager confronted me and said she saw my survey. I was confused - I said I didn‚Äôt remember getting one. She said they see the email addresses of the people who respond which is the same as my hotel rewards account. She aggressively told me they get yelled at for an 8 out of 10, and that anything below 10 out of 10 is a reprimand. I explained that the system wasn‚Äôt fair - how were they supposed to compete against 5-star chains charging $500 per night? Everyone can‚Äôt be 10 out of 10. She scowled and gave me my room key.

The next day, she and her assistant were there at breakfast. She was walking around, purposefully ignoring me, asking everyone how there food was. She stood next to me and loudly said to another guest, ‚ÄúYou like your eggs? THEY‚ÄôRE NOT POWDERED, just so you know.‚Äù She walked around saying a lot of things like that. It was pretty uncomfortable.

I never stayed there again."
"I am laughing, but feeling for you"
Bruh even tear free soap burns my urethra how the fuck you gunna use dish soap
Use your towel as a makeshift broom to sweep glass out of the way.
I really wanna put on a game where my life is good and sleep with it. 
I would have complained about being told it was an anonymous survey and being harassed in public about it.
"Don't bother cleaning it either, we are now going to just throw away."
"I thought you were gonna tell a story about how you were kicked off of a plane, or met by authorities when you landed."
Dam 27 hours of blindness I would be shitting my pants.
Wouldn‚Äôt dish soap make your dick hole burn like a syphilis infection? I vaguely remember using shampoo as a kid and never doing it again. 
"Ouch. At least you're being preemptive about seeing a doctor, unlike that one *brand-my-arm-with-a-penis* guy on this sub not too long ago. Hope you recover soon, OP. "
"Great story and a very unexpected plot twist. I knew the plot twist was coming but I was still surprised.

*He's alone at sea, what if they leave him?*

*What if there's a shark*

*He holds up his finger, is a fish going to bite it?*

*could the fish food be poop?*


Loved the story!"
"Personally, I can't wait for the next one. "
Hormonal teens should masturbate before taking any weird masturbation decisions.
"When I went for my test I sat in the car waiting for the instructor for over an hour. When he finally got in he was PISSED and the whole test only took about 5 minutes he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre done, you passed‚Äù and then left. I had been practicing parallel parking for so long and after I did the first back up in he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fine‚Äù and we were done, I was a little annoyed I didn‚Äôt get to show off my skills.
   I went inside asking around about why and saw cops and a crying teenager. Someone else waiting for their test gave me the full story: 

   Apparently the kid testing in front of me went on a small highway as part of the test and a school bus going the opposite direction put its red lights on and stop sign. Well the kid didn‚Äôt stop (there was only a cement section separating the lanes, no actual divider) and he ended up getting pulled over. The cops (2 cruisers) escorted him back to the driving center where he got a ticket (with a large fine) and had his permit revoked for 2 years. 
   "
"This happened to me as well.. except my instructor never told me  and continued the test for close to 25min. It was pouring and the guy was a complete asshole. 

Go to take my 2nd test a week later on the other aide of town. I wasn't aware instructors went to all test spots. I got the same asshole and another 20min test then he failed me again for some bullshit.

3rd times a charm? That asshole was there AGAIN but my dad talked to him and I was able to have the other instructor test me. She gave me a perfect score and actually said a few other have complained about the other guy. He was hostile and made some drivers really uncomfortable and nervous. "
"I was cringing too hard to even read this whole fuck up. I had to squint my eyes and skim through it til the end. 



I am never going to have children. "
Your bathroom looks bitchin though.
"Were the cops understanding about the whole thing, after the they figured out it was a prank?

"
"You know the those obscene crimes where people are murdered by their own family, by their own loved one and there is no rhyme or reason to it?

This is the kinda shit that we don't hear about. The hidden secret that only the killer knows.

This could easily have been a story about a quiet boy who went crazy one day and killed his loving dad for no apparent reason."
"Relax. If I read right, all you did was ""lean in"".  That is not bad behavior by any stretch.
I gather you are quite young, and I am the mother of three grown sons, so it may help if I say this.  Young men of your generation find yourselves in a no-win situation.  You have all been taught to respect women and, frankly, fear them, fear them because they have the ability to allege, and there is no defence.
You were not a creep.  It sounds like she enjoyed your company for hours, so keep that as a great memory.  Do not take responsibility for ""misreading"", because you sound like a very pulled-together young man. Give yourself credit for not doing what you really wanted to do (but could never admit because that would be --gasp--sexualizing women.

You will be in plenty of more situations like that in the future.  Just don't drink too much that you can't keep a level head.
You cool, don't beat yourself up.
"
Where's the TIFU in this? Sounds like a pretty good experience overall.
Fuck your coconuts.
Seriously! Soap makes things slippery by breaking down the oils and fats in your skin! SOAP IS NOT A LUBRICANT KIDS!
"It‚Äôs possibly the only story I‚Äôve read that I can fully understand the saying ‚ÄúI wanted the ground to swallow me up‚Äù 

I hope his dad doesn‚Äôt speak of this again... until he gives a speech on his wedding day."
"My ex-husband failed because he hit a squirrel. He asked if he should have swerved and the tester said no, that was also an automatic fail. So was stopping in the middle of the road. Basically, if a squirrel appears, you fail. "
My thoughts exactly.
tfw youve sterilized the tifu community
Yes we do
"Your dad thought he and the couch really had something, and now you've ruined it."
She told me there‚Äôs a loveseat on the way!! 
"Just a prank, don't taze me bro"
You must be new to Reddit. 
"Not really a fuck up. Your mom is just a prude.

I really don't see why your girlfriend can't keep her own sex toys."
"Pretty, sure ""Dead"" and ""Kid"" are some key words triggering a rather substantial police presence.  "
I can just imagine what the kid said that the police came with back up.
"Yes, Reddit Hall of Fame"
"Dont sweat it OP. Let me tell you my exam experience.

On the day of the test, the driving school I was enrolled in booked me and some 18 yr old to take the test. We get there and while we wait for the instructor to call our names, the kid is bragging about how they should just give him his license because the test was easy blah blah blah.He goes first. 

A few moments later, I see him turning the corner heading back to the parking lot but instead of slowing down, the car accelerates. 

**WHAM!**

He jumps the curb and hits a parked vehicle. The instructor says she's done for the day, the car loaned to use by the driving school is wrecked, and that's how I had to reschedule my driver's exam."
"I can't speak for her, but from what I've read and as a person of the female type, I wouldn't consider this a metoo moment. I'd consider it missed signs and/or a drunk guy on a plane. She's probably awkwardly laughing it off with her friends. "
I was excited to hear about the person so naieve they're basically a real life Butters.
Breaking the fourth wall hey? 
"I'm sorry that someone hurt you, it will be ok."
I still am to this day.
No kidding. I have a leather set I bought used and if my son ever does this...
It would never occur to me to check for spiders when cooking. It‚Äôs entirely possible you‚Äôve ruined my life.
"Sounds like you're getting a new girlfriend. Congrats! Just yell RAWR XD a few times, and im sure you scare him away."
"funny story. when I took my test the first time in a Ford LTD station wagon, I fail the parallel parking when I could not get the wagon parked.  They had 2 coffee cans with a stick with a flag on it that you had to park between.  I was unable to fit that 49 foot long station wagon in between the poles.  

The next day before they office opened, I moved one of the coffee cans about 6 feet farther, giving me extra room to parallel park on my second try.
"
Smooth!
Then akwardly sit on kitchen chairs watching tv
"been to the ER high as balls, concerned about shortness of breath and dizziness for a few days. Straight up disclosed ""I'm high right now, I smoke a lot every day, but even then I still feel like something is off""

The ER doctor took me serious, they did all the exams needed, determined I had bronchitis which explained the symptoms, and told me I was just freaking out because of the pot paranoia but I'd end up fine.

I told her my fear was that I was killing myself with pot and *that's* what's causing my lung problems; she reassured me it's not the case and sent me home.

No shame, just a cool doctor educating a pothead on what's going on with his health...

Don't suspect your doctors; they are usually way more cool with drug use than you think (unless you're giving them trouble or are being a complete ass from being high, etc)"
TIFU by experiencing a real-life Rom-com. 
"He's not saying anything now, but in ten years your dad will bring that up every time you bring a girlfriend home. As is his right. "
"I guess I‚Äôll share my story. Hopefully my family, or him for that matter, won‚Äôt see this... Its been a tricky situation. Every time he started acting jealous I‚Äôd do everything I could to show him I was trust worthy. When he acted jealous or ridiculous we‚Äôd fight about it, but I‚Äôd always apologize or he would. Our fights were rough but they never lasted more than three hours before we came to our senses and apologized. 

But It got to the point where I hung out with one other person, besides my family, the whole time we were together. It was very lonely and stressful getting told I was acting suspicious for little things like staring at someone to many times (usually three), or if I wanted to spend time alone on a walk up the street it would be suspicious, if I wore make up he‚Äôd be frustrated because he should be the only person I want to impress, we were in Vegas once and these two drunk gals came up to me and told me I was pretty, and he was certain they were hookers because they wouldn‚Äôt just say something like that unless they wanted something... Tons of things like that. 

So I stopped wearing make up, going out, and became more of a home body. I was a very outgoing person, I enjoyed meeting new people and listening to their stories, and I found that part of me gone. I battled with depression for a while and I finally learned to love myself, before I met him, and I found myself going back to that depressed state. Granted, he helped me stay happy for a while. I‚Äôve never laughed with anyone more in my entire life. I love that man more than anything but I was scared that loving him would cost that love for me I worked so hard to get. 

Our sex life went down hill, I was having a hard time feeling romantic towards him, and I still do. I have a bit of a promiscuous past, (and I won‚Äôt discuss that on here, I tried once and reddit can be a dark and hurtful place) and that really got to him because he always thought about how what we have was already shared with so many other people. His facial expressions are so easy for me to read, I‚Äôd know he was upset after we made love, so I‚Äôd bring it up and I guess I can be hot headed at times, and we would fight. It was something I couldn‚Äôt change or fix and that hurt me so badly, seeing how much it hurt him. So I ended up associating sex with negativity. I mean what kind of a relationship would it be with no sex.. it would be a friendship. And that‚Äôs not fair for him. 

Plus there‚Äôs my family.. my mother doesn‚Äôt like the fellow because he smokes. When I told her it was over it she was thrilled and told me that if I did stay with him she wouldn‚Äôt have given me my ‚Äúinheritance‚Äù money, which I would have relied on for our future kids college. It‚Äôs a fairly large amount and with the way things are going with the cost of education it was something important to me. And having a relationship with my mom is important to me too even though she can be a jerk sometimes, but she has done everything for her children, even if she did it wrong, and I‚Äôm very grateful and appreciative. Plus she‚Äôs my fucking mom, I love the bitch. A combination of all of it just makes it hard to get back together. Mostly the sex part. 

We did go on a date a few days ago, he‚Äôs actually doing amazing, his attitude has changed, he‚Äôs losing weight, quit smoking his e-cig, I‚Äôm hoping a part of me will change to get that romance back.. but there‚Äôs also that part of me that‚Äôs scared he‚Äôll go back to how he was. He could truly believe he‚Äôs changed and I know he has, but for how long? He always told me he‚Äôd change when we had our little fights and he did for a bit, then it was back to the jealousy and fights. There‚Äôs a part of me that still wants to try, and a part of me that is so jaded and done, I don‚Äôt want to try again just to hurt him again because I can‚Äôt get that love back. Not only would it hurt him again but it would hurt me as well. To break his heart twice would just break something inside of me that I‚Äôm scared of losing. 

Edit: didn‚Äôt mean to go on such a rant! I‚Äôm spacing it out to make it easier on the eyes.. "
"My grandpa refused the shots was terrified of needles.  He would get root canals, cavities, tooth pulled without it.

"You can build 1,000 bridges, but if you fuck one couch, people aren‚Äôt going to call you a bridge builder."
"I think the lesson here is not that you underdressed, but that you didn't ask what type of attire you should wear. 

Even within an industry, each company can be different as can each city. I work in San Francisco and what you wore sounds totally appropriate, but a similar company elsewhere would think different. 

In short, just ask the recruiter what's appropriate for the company. Outside of very few exceptions, it's never a weird question to ask. "

"As someone in the hospitality industry just know you did nothing wrong, especially after contacting the front desk. It does not matter if the room was free, you show up to our establishments expecting a certain level of service, which was not provided. In fact I am happy you left this review and even though you might not see it, if the general manager is worth even half of his salary he should be as well as this is the only way he would discover these issues. 
To the second point, if the group hiring you does have relations with the hotel (i.e. can get you free rooms) then they should be absolutely livid with the hotel for putting you in this position. I would follow up on trip advisor with a post about the repercussions of your review. If this is how they treat people who have had a negative time in their establishment then everyone should be made aware of this. 
I am truly sorry for the lack of hospitality you have been shown by our industry, especially since guests attitudes should be our top priority. Please for the betterment of our entire industry follow up on yelp and trip advisor with the unexcusable manor in which they addressed this issue.

PS. Someone paid for that room in someway even if you did not see the immediate exchange of goods"
TIL you can slut shame a couch.
"Something for you to try: mucus going down your throat is basically the last reaction your body has before you start puking. It does this to lubricate your throat so it doesn't get damaged. When you cry you also generate mucus. My guess is that you have a sensitive reaction in this regard. If you hold your head down like you're looking at the floor and spit out all the moisture you can then you can often avoid triggering that response. Maybe that'll help? Worth a try.

I've been through a broken engagement, it totally sucks. I'm sorry for your heartache. A few months from now your life will probably be happier than it has been in a long time. Best of luck to ya."

Your brothers friend responds to crisis situations well. Did not hesitate for a moment.

"Seems like the cement section would make it a divided highway. If I remember my written test correctly, you don‚Äôt have to stop for a school bus with flashing lights on if you are moving in opposing directions on a divided highway. 

I hope that kids parents looked into that because what constitutes a divided highway may be vague. My understanding is a divided highway needs to have some non-driveable feature separating opposing traffic. It could be a grassy median, with or without a curb, or a raised or flat concrete divider, that is visually distinctive from the road.

I just thought of your promposal. Sorry about smashing your face on the floor. Come to prom with me and ill smash you again right after to make up for it.
"Jokes on them, i'm driving my 1962 F100. Back when safety was for pussies."
It's not like you're fully switched on when youre first waking up though. Half the time I'm confused about wtf is going on for 30s even when I'm just looking in my normal room.

"So glad that guy didn't die, now I can laugh without worry.

I was so nervous for my test that I went to take a left on red. The shame. 
"Seriously. Especially considering that the kid was just trying to get his license and likely had very little experience.   Maybe give them the fine, so that there is some kind of negative/loss to learn from, but to throw the book at him, and ban him from driving for two more years does seem harsh.   "
So you still asking her to prom?
"Yes haha I stopped trying to explain it and just show people the snoop dogg scene from scary movie 5 when he talks about it  hurts for days after. I used to pee and jerk off in the shower and even would ask for shower sex. 

Now I owe before I enter. The shower is a no jerking zone. And once was enough to realize that there were way to many negative variable to make shower sex fun. 


3 days of burning piss isn't worth any of the above ever again. "
"1978: In the future, we'll probably have flying cars and a colony on mars!

"Legitimately good advice. Also, couches are a no."

Thank you OP for breaking the chain."
Be proud. You may have just completed your very first suicide intervention.
You can decide that a relationship isn't right for you without hating the other person.
sexual harassment for being called fat? what? is this really a thing?
I thought you weren't able to get the same instructor. Something about bias
"you'll get it next time. The dmv tester's are a handful.  Mine took off points because he didn't give out perfect scores.  When I pressed him about why, he said I could have signaled earlier one one of my turns, which I had started signaling seconds after completing a previous turn.  They are just paid to do shit like trick you into rolling through a stop sign."
"Oh my God, that's incredible...

It only takes you three minutes to poop?"
"Yea, she's going to sue you in small claims court and win. 

Here's what you do. 

1. Apologize profusely.

2. Explain you can not afford $500.

3. Offer to clean this girl's carpet. Not like scrub with a brush, but rent a rug doctor (about $100) and clean the whole carpet. I don't care if you can't afford this. You need to.

4. Get this agreement in writing if she agrees.

5. Clean her carpet and give her a small gift. Maybe cry a little. 

6. She'll feel sorry for you and will go out with you.

7. Date her.

8. Marry her and tell the funny story of how you met at your wedding.

9. Buy a house in the suburbs, have a couple of kids, get a dog.

10. Shit on the carpet and blame the kids. "
"It was interesting and scary at the same time. We were constantly watched by uniformed and undercover KGB agents, we could go to the pioneer camps but were not allowed to interact with the children, and the black market ran everything! In our 54 hour train ride from Murmansk to Moscow the black market actually got the train to stop in the middle of nowhere at night so they could restock the train with their illicit goods. 

Scariest part for me was departing: We were there so long, and the food and water were so bad, that I lost so much weight I no longer looked like my passport photo. I was detained and questioned at the airport for hours as our delegation leader pleaded and negotiated. "
"Also, with drawing skills like this you're going to be fucking a lot more couches."
TIFU by having one of the best first date stories ever.
"Also, you'll learn that 700 dollar for a real leather couch is extremely cheap and you'll be happy to get one out of some cheaper fabric for that money"
uhh I may have to abandon that plan now... lol we'll see
"If it makes you feel better, a girl who had her exam right before me failed before she got out of the parking stall because she didn't know how to turn on her lights and her hand signals. "
"This is why I‚Äôm 22 and FINALLY switched to an adult dentist. I would get cavities filled at my pediatric dentist and the nurse lady would rub my arm and say ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, just a little poke‚Äù when they give me the Novocain shot. Hurts for like half a second but I‚Äôm so soothed by this old lady that I‚Äôm not even stressin‚Äô it! "
Has he been cheated on before? Sounds like a friend of mine
TLDR; You fucked a couch and your dad came.
Un-planned anal does not sound like a fun time. Dick stuck in the conditioner is definitely the better option.
There's some big headphone merchant being talked about on /r/headphones that is blacklisting anyone from buying from him in the future of they leave a less-than-5-star review. So... Some places will treat you horrible even if it wasn't free. lol
It was sad.  He didn't tell the kid until the end of the test.  So the whole time the poor kid was thinking he still had a shot.  Kid was in tears.
I hit the curb leaving the DMV and the tester just told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to pretend that didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù. Ended up still passing thank god
"and your father, apparently"
"This is like the movie Saw, except that the player created the trap himself and Jigsaw has nothing to do with it."
How on earth do you even get such an idea? Watched too much American Pie?
"I wasn‚Äôt trying to be ‚Äúthat‚Äù guy, but to fair, definitely don‚Äôt criticize free services for sure.  Thanks for sharing your story."
Good bot.
‚ÄúTIFU by doing everything perfectly and basically my life is a fairytale‚Äù
I can‚Äôt. Both my arms are broken. Any help ?
"&gt;I hope he manages to find a girlfriend soon, but it's not looking good.

Just get him a furniture store catalog and he can get a mail-order bride."
"That actually makes me feel a bit better, I couldn't believe how dumb I was to try that. She probably would have met up with me later and at worst I would have gained a friend. Blew it."
So far he only dented it.
my driving test didn't even include parallel parking... lol
This guy HIPAAs.
"As a prank, a friend in high school tied up his buddy in the backyard within view of the front door. He then ordered pizza and when the delivery guy came and saw the dude tied up he called the cops.

Both of the guys had to do community service the whole summer."
Somebody was coming at me head-on while taking my test and I swerved to miss the person and I got points taken off.
"Maybe she forgot?  You said you were drunk so maybe was she drinking too?  
This moment of yours isn't anything to worry about and at the first signal of ""no"" with the lack of a phone number you've backed off. This is a normal interaction.. you're not a mind reader.. stop stressin :)"
"You're right.  In his dad's mind, he will forever be known as: Notorious CFG. (Cough Fucking Guy)"
dont tempt me
"When I read ""his wife"" I was pretty confused. I get it now."
It'd freeze before touching the ground.
