"This is a great question and I wish more people considered it. I grew up in Jackson Heights, was just there to see my dentist yesterday. I don't have definitive answers but let me toss out some things to consider:
- JH is not 95% Latino. It's one of the most mixed areas of the city (Indian, all kinds of Asian, plenty of white folks, and yes, lots of Latinos).
- I personally recommend beginning to speak to people initially in English. It's the lingua franca of that neighborhood and besides you otherwise run the risk of offending a few types of people: folks who aren't Latino but look like they might be, Latinos who don't speak Spanish, and folks who speak perfectly good English and may feel like you assumed they don't.
- My strategy is to always start in English and ask permission to switch to Spanish if I get the sense (via accent and other clues) that the person would be way more comfortable in that language.
- Be yourself. 
- Treat everyone with dignity. 
- I'm sure this goes without saying --  but -- there are certain conservative groups in JH (for example the JH Beautification Group) who rally against street vendors (food carts and artisans, say) or other elements of the informal economy (the guys who sell fake social security cards, which folks need in order to find a job). Overwhelmingly white groups like these use these issues, in my opinion, as a cover for anti-immigrant organizing. Avoid them if you can, call them on their B.S. if they engage you.
- Support local businesses. Go to Espresso 77, not Starbucks. Check out Terraza 7, a cool hangout for lefty, hip Latinos. Best empanadas are at La Nueva (not at Mama's, that place is a bad joke). 
- There is a lot of tolerance in JH, but you will also encounter a lot of casual racism (especially if you speak Spanish and over hear people speaking freely in your presence). If it is safe to do so, give racist folks the side eye.
- Introduce yourself to folks, especially if you see them more than once. 90% of the time folks will be glad to meet you and most come from cultures well known for their hospitality. 
- Your new neighborhood is amazing. Explore.

You need to get out to Jackson Heights where there is actually an Indian population. 
"Bus routes have a schedule, if driver is ahead of schedule, he will wait at stops, stay on schedule.  Source: am bus driver."

"You might be able to ban the amplification, but you can't ban someone's right to state their opinion in a public space. We definitely can't ban people expressing their religion in public. That's, like, the first amendment, man. 

Also the people asking if you're Jewish is because of a Jewish tradition during certain parts of the year to try to encourage non-practicing Jews to return to synagogue. They're asking if you're Jewish because they have strict rules about not trying to proselytize to non-Jewish folks. 

I have, however, on a few occasions when a subway preacher really pissed me off, enjoyed shouting Matthew 6:5 back at them. Thanks, Catholic grandmas!"
"Are you serious? Where are you buying your groceries? Cooking for yourself is always, almost without exception, cheaper than eating out."
Don’t let the dog assert dominance. Do the New York thing and Pee on him back. 
"Maybe this is just based on my experiences, but I also live in a heavily Latino neighborhood and walking up to someone and starting right out the gate with ""Hi, buenas tardes"" could rub them the wrong way. Like you're assuming they don't speak English or even making fun of them, based very carefully on your attitude and tone. I've seen it spark tensions more than once.

Don't walk on eggshells and treat people as different and they won't retaliate by ostracizing you, either. "
"Call [NYC Well](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/nyc-well.page) at 1-888-NYC-WELL, the City's support line. That'll give you someone to talk to any time and should have some good cost-conscious referrals.

You may also want to check out [support services](http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/categories/social-services.page) that may be available during this tough time.

Once the most immediate concerns have been addressed, you might consider volunteering (it feels good to help others), joining your local running or walking club (same for exercise and socializing), and attending free events at your local library.

Sorry to hear you're feeling down. You're tougher than you know, take things day by day, and you will get through this."
Seconding this. My neighbors are mostly Dominican but I've always started with English. The ones who don't speak it let me know right away. Then I'd switch to Spanish and they were usually pleasantly surprised.
Probably because nobody wants to walk home with a big/heavy case of beer to their tiny apartment where they won't have any room to store it.
"Philly is great and a cheap, quick bus or train.

Beacon is a nice artsy small town trip up the Hudson.

Greenport is nice if you like off-season seaside towns. "
"It’s Queens man you’re not in a 3rd world country.  They know people speak English.

I know you mean well, but it’s just a normal neighborhood not fucking Epcot Center.  Where did you live previously, different cultures/backgrounds aren’t odd novelties which require kid gloves.

I’ve seen transplants and tourists bow to old Cantonese ladies my entire life, and countless attempts to speak mandarin to the same old ladies who only speak Cantonese.  I feel embarrassed for everyone in that horrific situation, it’s bad enough Chinatown is disappearing but the actual residents shouldn’t be treated like a prop in Disneyland.

It’s completely awkward and uncomfortable for everyone involved, just speak English if you’re not a polyglot."
They're yarmulkes - all Jewish cars must wear them.
Tell your roommates to lock the doors and windows when leaving the apartment.
You tip as though you paid the full bill.
"I just want to say, I just want to jump in here, I just had three damn martinis and have been listening to The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 soundtrack maybe a few too many times, but I need to say I was like you.

You have NO IDEA.

Every year in NYC, for *sixteen goddamn years* I would try whatever I could to go pick apples. But it was never possible, and I didn't know how to drive.

As soon as late August I'd be hitting up the farmers' markets for whatever hell they had, those horrid early season gingers, whatever. One autumn I found a haul of Stayman Winesaps (my favorite) that must have just come off the tree and my friends were aghast as I walked around Brooklyn all night eating apples. 

Listen, I have friends who are true gustatory eccentrics. We make gumbos, we have chili cookoffs, we would scour Chinatown for the hottest Sichuan, we'd butter poach lobster, we'd walk from Greenpoint to Laguardia and eat at every cart on the way. But nothing, nothing prepared my friends for my fresh-picked apple consumption.

At work, people would ask why I'd end emails in the fall with a little postscript about apple season coming soon. 

They just. Don't. Get it. If I buy seven good apples at the market, there's a chance I'll eat two on the subway, two at Mugs, one on the walk home, and another in the kitchen. 

Last year I saw your post and would have gone, would have reached out, but my second son was close to being born and my first one was running around throwing the cast iron pans. 

But the last point here is that 6 months ago, we moved the hell out. The landlady's son had stolen too many packages, the rent was getting high, and I'd look into the eyes of my children and see a childhood without apple picking. Without trees, without accidents on mountaintops, with excessive supervision. So we got away. Moved to New Hampshire.

And buddy? Ho-leeeeeee SHIT. Sure, there are *no* good bars in my town. Not a single decent restaurant, and way too few immigrants. But when the first leaf gets a hint of brown, we hit the damn orchards at 9am every single weekend. I think we've been apple picking maybe 10 times? 15?  There are three orchards within a ten minute drive of our house. They have swings. They're on massive hills. You get lost in the mutsus. You can spend 5 hours just walking around eating and sampling the different kinds and watching for hawks. You see kids pulling apples off of trees and throwing them for fun, I want to shake them and shout, ""In NY I would have paid $5 for that work of art!"" My poor wife sees me holding my stomach on the floor and cries, ""Stop eating apples. STOP!""

So next fall, as we're almost done, come visit NH. Take a bus.

[Here's what it's like.](https://imgur.com/a/90HYT) The bottom photo is my new favorite apple, the Hudson Golden Gem that is tart and hard and sweet, but as it gets later in the season becomes a bit like a pear.

Good luck to you brother, we're all out there."

"&gt;I was excited to move to NYC because I hear there's great Indian food here

*Is* NYC really known for ""great Indian food""? I would actually dispute that. In the 70's, just the fact that NYC had Chinese, Italian, and Indian restaurants meant it had more diverse food options. But if we're talking the 21st century, I don't feel like Indian food has had it's moment in NYC. We had the ""comfort food"" craze where barbecue, hamburgers and fried chicken was being made high-end with places like Spotted Pig and Shake Shack. Molecular gastronomy was big when WD~50 was around. And with David Chang's Momofuku empire, there was a lot of Asian fusion going on (not to mention the ramen resurgence). But I don't feel like NYC has had a big Indian food movement in the past 20 years.

There *are* ethnic conclaves like [""Curry Hill""](https://ny.eater.com/2017/2/21/14690046/pete-wells-reviews-sahib-curry-hill) in Manhattan, Jackson Heights, Queens or Hicksville, Long Island where there are plenty of authentic Indian restaurants. But besides Tamarind and Dhaba (the high-end places), the rest are Indian ""joints"" that serve the same stuff (Chicken tikka, paneer, various generic ""curry""). You can find good Indian food, but as for ""authentic"" stuff that's not standard-issue, you need to actually go somewhere where Indian people eat."
I seem to be in the minority but I always just do a flat $5. 
"It's usually it's for film and television production. It takes them a day or so to slowly reclaim all the parking spots on the street for production trucks and trailers. There is usually a guy in a car somewhere to claim the spots with the cone when they become available. Why the cone is on top of the car, is a great question and I'm realizing now I have no idea and have been zero help. "

"Depends. First, does the woman look like the stabby type? Second, how much time do I have?

If she doesn't look stabby and I have time, I'd confront her."
"Say ""Yo, Lady, your dog just pissed on my bag."" then tell her to give you 20-40 bucks to pay for cleaning the bag (depending on how nice the bag is).  

But to be somewhat fair here, the cardinal rule of the subway is don't bring it on there if you cant afford to get piss on it.  "
"You can tell her you threw it in the trash. I mean, she doesn’t really have much of a leg to stand on - legally or otherwise. But... you did say she is crazy so what’s it worth to you?  Personally I’d tell her to go fuck herself. "
I’ll hang out with you. 
"Take the Merritt Parkway/CT-15. Choose ""avoid tolls"" on google maps and it will send you up to that route."
"Most obvious reason is due to normal wear and tear, it's better to force the user to get a new card than to deal with replacing the card after the magnetic strip is useless and spending that time and energy sending in a card, figuring out what is on it, refunding money, you buying a new card with the fee.

Plus when the cards expire they can keep the money that people leave on the cards if they don't move it to a new card within two years of it expiring."
"I'd confront her. Remind her that if that isn't a service dog it needs to be in a carrier. I'd ask for her contact information and ask that she reimburse me for the cost of the bag. Honestly, I am shaking my head here in disbelief. "
"Yo just wait here bro.  It's NYC, they bring the apples to us"
JH is amazing. And not just the Indian places (which completely shame the offerings in Manhattan). The Tibet food there rocks (VERY spicy) as does the Thai. 
Come across the river to Edison we'll set you straight
