"I didn't eat for 3 months. How long have you went without eating? It's not patronizing, it's a question. Have had obese friends that stopped for a time. They are all much healthier now. 1 is even no longer diabetic. Seems like a simple concept to me, which is the reason I asked. "

Op's post specified that they eat at 6 because kids need to sleep. Doesn't seem to leave much time to be social. 
And?

"I do this every time I use a toilet in a public place. No one can call you on it, as it's yours to take as much as you need, you only have to have a little patience and you can save a great deal of money. I sometimes wear a backpack just so I could stuff loads of it inside. "
"I'm assuming you don't drink, so I'll fill you in. It's incredibly hard to operate in any ""normal"" social capacity as a young person if you don't drink. Drinking is the norm therefore if you don't drink you aren't normal and people act like there's something wrong with you. "
Thank you !

After Last Jedi and the new Pacific Rim, I'm very careful about anything he does.  He acts fine, its just he picks projects that take thinks I love and somehow they end up terrible.

"&gt; Hell, I refused any sedative for a colonoscopy

When I had mine the doc said he doesn’t even offer any meds until he’s past a specific part in the procedure, and even then, only about 25% of people take the meds.

It really wasn’t that bad; I dunno why you’d need sedation for it"

I hope not. I dont want my kids seeing that shit on TV or in public
"If they didn't abuse them in the first place withdrawal wouldn't be an issue along with the countless rehab centers that are available

If addiction is a disease get a doctor to fucking fix it at a rehab center like people who go to doctors at hospitals to get themselves treated "

Mmmhm cancer and heart disease sure do sound delicious. All those animals separated from their loved ones jist to die for the taste buds of a brainwashed human being for no more than ten minutes sure does sound satisfying. End animal cruelty and GO VEGAN!

How do you feel about me urinating in public?
Idk my urine tests always come back with a pH of 7. I don't think it's that far out of the ordinary.
"Nope that would still require me to give some of my limited time to him, and that's something he doesn't deserve."

"Thing is, unless it's already ruptured the aneurysm doesnt usually produce symptoms. So I'm kinda on the doctors side here. Obviously, limited information and all that but for all we know the patient was fine or had minor other complaints but nothing that warranted a random high radiation CT scan of the bloodvessels in his head.

"
"&gt;Mormon... That's whack people do/believe that

Hmmm, something about a pot and a kettle comes to mind...."
Eat tortillas/tacos
Obviously I do not know how the patient presented and I assume there might be more to the story but for all I know the doctor did exactly what was needed. You dont randomly order a MRA or CTA to screen for brain aneurysms. Aneurysms usually are detected while looking for something else or after theyve ruptured. Oftentimes an examination might seem rushed but that doesnt mean the doctor hasnt ruled out the severe ddx that might be possible in this case. 
"Haha no shit. I love that you're downvoted to shit too. Every time Amy Schumer gets mentioned it becomes this massive circle jerk about how she makes jokes they cant relate to as men and calling her a cunt that deserves to die and if anyone questions it it's all ""dont make this a gender thing"" "
Yeah it sucks. Especially since the original comment they are getting upvoted. like atleast /u/eagle628 actually said something instead of giving a dislike/downvote. These are the type of people I like
"These kinds of situations are where I put my foot down, and I don't care if I sound like a ""controlling dude"" if I'm going on a date with you, you're not allowed to bring a friend. No exceptions. If a girl isn't secure enough to meet me without the support of her friend, then they're certainly not a match for me. That kind of behavior gets me really annoyed. 

Edit - looks like all the ""nice guys"" need to step up and protect their women from me abusing them. "

"It is a fact. Islam will devour Europe and turn it into a Mulsim hellhole given enough time and inaction from misguided politicians. We are seeing it happening as we speak.  The problem is the venomous insta-hate that is programmed into to people. We can't even bring up the subject in calm discussion anymore.  See the rage-filled responses to this question.  Islam cannot and will assimilate or integrate into western Christian nations. It is against everything they believe in. This will lead to either war or the death of western values and culture and the rise of the barbaric inhuman Sharia law.

"Rofl, I responded to you. We can't have a civilized discussion? Typical religious people. Closing eyes and ears. Double standards."
"I think what OP is referring to is NOT

""People don't believe in bisexuals""

But rather that some people believe that bisexuals will in some way or another ""damage"" society.

OP is saying that they themselves don't belive bisexuals will somehow hurt people."

"If you're depressed for more than 5 years you should qualify for assisted suicide and assisted suicide should be legal
EDIT:I do not mean that if youre depressed you should qualify for assisted suicide. I mean if you meet the conditions similart to mine which i explained bellow and are either an adult or a minor with consenting parents who has been seeking treatment for at least 5 years to no avail you should be able to qualify. There need to be strict rules to make sure it's not a temporary suicidal and depressive state. But if you feel you are beyond hope and there is someone or something preventing you from dying i think at that point the law or a doctor should be able to step in"
"Just has to do with how we view personal freedom. Americans value the right of the individual over the perceived greater good. Thats why we let people own guns, we let neo-nazis have parades and all that other shit. I think culturally and even economically it brings some interesting results. The only reason i think the US is the ""best"" country is because i really feel here you can pretty much do whatever the fuck you want and society just lets you be.   

For what its worth, i fucking hate guns but i think gun laws def need to change. You should be allowed to have a revolver / pistol or whatever for personal self defense, and there should be measures taken to make sure you're fit to own one. The more guns you want, the stricter the measures should be. Also, the laws should be appropriate to where you live. I'm glad theres no guns in NYC for example; id be terrified to step foot there. But i dont think NYC and rural Montana should have the same gun laws.  
The uzis, assault rifles and all those other war weapons are fucking ridiculous; Those issues have more to do with corruption in the government from lobbying groups than anything"
I don't know where you get your news but I am afraid that it appears to be somewhat incorrect 
"To be fair it has decent drama and right now it has a lot of Ice clips.    
You have to at least acknowledge Ice for what he does.
 - his content is reality tv shows 2.0 made for modern people who live a good half of their lives in the internet. And thanks to this sub i don't even need to watch Ice, it has all the clips.    
Random clips of other streamers are good too sometimes.    
Open it - check titles, check flairs, watch 1-2 clips and begone."

"Most of that would be covered under private insurance. The thing is that we actually see the numbers due to how hospital billing works and US insurance applies moderate cost sharing to a lot of things so we don't have all the stupid shit Japan's dealing with.

Most people who can't pay have either been ducking having insurance or have no savings to cover the fairly moderate cost sharing or deductible (or have the rare true indemnity plan, in which you have to pay out of pocket and the insurance reimburses you with a check). It's actually worse in a lot of other countries, which instead of a deductible (a given amount you pay out of pocket before the insurance kicks in, which I should remind you you'd be paying anyway but in monthly fees or, outside of the US, taxes) stop paying after you've reached a certain cost, basically missing the point of health insurance."
