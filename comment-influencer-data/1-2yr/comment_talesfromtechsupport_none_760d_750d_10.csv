"My grandma has pages upon pages of how to use the computer. Mind you it's not cmds and pings, more like what to click to login to her e-mail, what to click to send e-mails and the like"
"Sounds to me like your grandpa is a smart dude. He was able to learn, retain and apply lots of recently learned skills. Sounds to me line he was just lacking a bit of knowledge we usually think is common sense. Id be surprised if you ever have to help him with the same problem more than twice."
"Followup:

Grandpa types: cmd -&gt; ping cellphone

OP: ""Grandpa you can't just type cellphone. It won't know what that is.""

Grandpa: ""I added it to the host file, son. I set the router give my cellphone a static IP. It should resolve.""

OP: ""Oh... You mind showing me how to do that?"""
"That guy doesn't rate being called an ""admin"" if he can't tell the difference between OLDDOMAIN and NEWDOMAIN..."
I bet she has got a degree in computering from the great Google-bing-university.
Maybe he just wanted an excuse so see his grandson =')
"No matter how much this might be the case:

&gt;Now this guy $Dev knew his stuff...

If this is ever associated with it:

&gt;$Dev only liked Internet Explorer, so he refused to test in any others since they were quote ""Crap.""

Then I *will* question his ‚Äúexpertise‚Äù; deeply, persistently and comprehensively. IE/Edge is the Cletus of the browser world, and if anyone who programs for the Web thinks otherwise, they need to surrender their developer‚Äôs credentials. I am largely agnostic with respect to browsers, I will even test in IE myself; but I am brutally honest with regards to their *suitability* as a browser, and IE has come in dead last ever since Firefox was released back in 2002."

This is maximum sacrifice sanity declares possible. Anything else and it's time to exorcise greedy spirits with a hammer and blowtorch.

Also, steak is horrible idea. It's dead, all vitality left it, juices can only do worse."
The wires are chi shielded.  If anything the wireless mouse and keyboard are going to cause chi fluctuations all over the place.
"The payroll software at work requires an older version of java and every stinking time our pcs update, it goes to hell and the poor IT guy is suddenly the most popular guy ever. "
This is not your regular stupid. This is advanced stupidity.
"Yea you are most definetly right, while I never expected anything close to this kind of outcome, when he's passionate about something it can be amazing to watch."
This sub when we're 80.

"granted he was up all night with the certificate things and might have been a bit underwater as the only windows admin here... but man, im not on call...

"Had family that worked with airplanes and checklists were your own personal Jesus. I never leave my desk without some sort of checklist. I got mocked for it at first but I didn't care, they worked well!"
"&gt; he boss told the tech guys they could ignore her tickets while he decided what to do and everyone has banded together not to help her.

I like this boss."
I write aircraft technical documentation now...  I have checklists on how to make checklists.
Well she is right. You have ethernet. 
Sounds more like he should be in software sales since they seem to have a knack for over promising features before a sale..  
"You could try ""impact"":

1: No impact (general query, etc)

2: I can work normally (minor issue)

3: This issue is affecting my productivity

4: This issue is causing major disruption to my work

5: This issue has caused me to stop working entirely

When you use ""priority"", everyone will pick a ""high"" priority because every issue is a high priority for them - which is entirely fair. It's different from your perspective because you have the context of all other issues. To solve this, you can phrase your priorities in a way that makes sense to your end users and also makes sense to you and your team.

Also +1 for CCing manager when the user selects ""major disruption"" or ""stop working"" impact."
"Oh hey, your grandpa is a backend developer"
"&gt; computering

Courses that just teach you how to send emails and do sums in Excel should totally be called this."
"I have a friend whos dad is in his late 80s, he was told to reboot his computer, switch it on and off. My friend was finally able to go to his house and found that he was switching his printer on and off. 

Anyway, how in the hell does this guy know to ping a mobile? lol that wouldn't have been my first step in troubleshooting no connection"
"Geez did these people not have wooden shapes and the like as children? I mean come on, I know TWO year olds who manage ""put the circle in the circular hole"" just fine. Possibly younger. How the hell do you get to 40+ without that knowledge?!"
"It's laptopulus rePAro, not laptopulus repaRO"
"Make sure you then reset her password for breaching policy/sharing her password, so she has to call you once she's back to be able to work.

If your company has it, refer her for mandatory IT security training."
"The flip side of ""you get what you pay for"" is ""you are valued what you cost"". I had much more success with family after I started ""charging"" for it. (cookies, home-cooked meals, reciprocation in services, etc, were all valid forms of payment).

That being said, yes, human stupidity might be the most renewable resource on the planet. We have the fortune of working in one of the few industries that not only has its share but seems to attract people who are *proud* to display it."
"To the manager of BOW;

BOW has requested personalized instruction on the operation of your office printer. She says that she is unable to use the supplied manual and will not follow instructions from telephone support technicians. 

We can schedule factory representative to do a presentation on the printer's operation two weeks from now. The cost is $550.  May we have your signature on the attached invoice? "
Is there any kind of fine for calling in unrelated people as witness?
On reading the title I was waiting for tipp-ex on the screen
"&gt; I may be a tech guy, but ~~I do not work for google and~~ I cannot remove information from the internet.

I'm an engineer at Google, and I cannot remove information from the internet."
"&gt; granted he was up all night with the certificate things

The thing I'm slowly learning in my job right now, is that it's important to be well rested when doing admin work. I'm pretty convinced that the Gitlab thing was largely a result of being too tired to pay attention to what you're doing."
Don't encourage.
I know right?! He told me the network symbol in the taskbar was too small for him and he prefers text that actually tells him there's no connection. Go figure... 
How do people NOT get this?
"Nah, computering means you know that the hard drive is sitting under the table and the computer is the screen. All mice are wireless and so are the keyboards. Sometimes the stupid it-people put wires on them but that's just to confuse you! Generally those it-guys have no clue whatsoever.

 Also you should always use the links provided in those mail reminding you that your password might be insecure. The more pictures and fonts they have the more urgent it must be.
Don't forget those nice Princes with their dead family.

" My reaction to the title: ""oh great someone jammed an HDMI cable into a USB port. ""

Currently screaming internally. "
"Sounds like he probably was an IT director. As in a professional manager, not a technical person. He expects to do his job through giving orders to subordinates. "
"Again, absolutely sounds like a case of nepotism. If someone above the very bottom rung of IT has a problem with Googling things, they are in the wrong fking field."
"Anything below IE11 is an uncleared minefield. Anything below IE10 is an uncleared minefield but your directions of movement are randomly inverted. 

IE11 is still a minefield, but a couple of mostly clear lanes have been carved through it. You'll probably get through without too many lost limbs."
"That's far beyond advanced.


That's weaponized stupidity."
"Wow.

That's not your normal, every day stupid.

That's... _advanced_ stupid."
"&gt; juices can only do worse.

I laughed way too hard at this. XD"
"Fuck, I laughed too much üòÇüòÇ.
Thanks, OP. You made my day. "
Its checklists all the way down.
"Read this as  
&gt; Stopped using IE 2 last week"
"Grandpa: ""Actually, back in my day, this is all we had. None of this fancy gooey windows mumbo-jumbo."""
"ahhh... living the dream.  How I wish I too could dictate that all users of my software use only a single browser of my choice.  Imagine living in that world.

Hell I'd even be happy if that single browser were IE.  It doesn't have to be best browser, it just has to be the *only* one."

"Cellular internet on our phones has really confused this younger generation. Non tech savy people just assume internet is everywhere since thats how technology is going.

Some have never had home internet until now or the first time in there life. They use there phone or tablet which is cellular and always works. The concept of home only internet is new to them, sadly."
Boss is cool as fuck. 
I hope you didn't change the cartridge while having a look. You don't want to give her what she wants.
"The moral is two fold.

"$ME: But my PC's don't even use ethernet. 

$CS: Ah, then you must have our wireless internet plan. 

$ME: No, I have fiber. 

$CS: Obviously not. Your computers are connected via Wi-Fi so you have our wireless plan. "
He had it on a note beside him. Did I mention how confused I was yet?
"See, I think I know what this user is thinking: ""I don't actually want to do it myself, so I'll screw this up as much as possible until he just gives up and comes to my desk and does it for me.""  Been there, done that. Probably doing it later today. ;)"

"Really, his big mistake was to rate himself with all perfect scores. He could have been ranging from 6-10 and weighted toward 8 just so he looks good but doesn't seem fraudulent. Tsk, tsk, pigs get eaten."
"You're right, it's all a lie. I have this big fat red button on my desk that deletes the internet.

"&gt;I am still trying to figure out how anyone could not comprehend the 90's era concept of bookmarks.

For the vast majority of people, all they know is ""I left-click once on this spot and Internet happens."" If you change the spot, you've broken Internet."
"Maybe he did. It's not happened in awhile, come to think of it. But it was crazy for awhile til he figured out the problem. "
Sounds like one of those cases where you need to ask for a meeting with the user and their &amp; your respective supervisors.
Can he not disable the java updater?
"&gt;""remove it from *the* Google"" 

*shivers* "
Agreed. We've just about stopped testing for IE 10 and below. 11 seems to not have too much fuss.
"I always get confused and try to down vote these posts for some reason.

Then I realize OP isn't the one saying it."
"Yes! We deal with things that can take down a company's production with a single wrong click. Doing work at 2am when staying up on red bull and then expecting to be at the top of your game is crazy. Rest, being mentally ready and competent is under rated by many folks and should be a higher priority."
"at least you didn't write something like ""what an idiot"" that would've been awkward

I'd like to hear the story on your manager though, sounds interesting"
"You restarted it and it worked, after the user 'restarted it'?  Congratulations, welcome to IT :D

May I suggest as your first act of cynicism, adopt a standard policy that if applicants cannot figure out the bullet-pointed directions on the application site, they are probably morons who you don't want working for the company anyway.  

So when people call in because they didn't read the directions, simply inform them that the company is only looking for people with good computer skills, therefore being able to use the application website should be considered the first part of the evaluation process and thus no help is available for it.  

Also, while I typed this jokingly, I think it would actually be a good policy to implement.  If the people applying can't follow the simple directions you've written, then they will probably be moronic users who call for IT support frequently and need their hand held a lot.  These users will be less productive and incur more support costs, so your company's bottom line might be helped by adopting this policy and screening them out early..."
