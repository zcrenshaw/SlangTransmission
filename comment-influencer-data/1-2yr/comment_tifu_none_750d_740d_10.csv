This only happens when the nestlings were going to fledge in a few days anyways, and putting them back in the nest at this point would have been nearly impossible, so don't worry. Assuming they don't get eaten by a cat or hawk, they will be fine.

Even though the little fledgling can't fly, its parents are going to care for and feed it for the next few weeks, mostly because they've already put for a tremendous amount of effort and it would be a waste to stop now.

One day after dinner my mouth was itchy which is totally normal b/c I eat anything I like and just pop an OTC allergy pill.

But that time the pill did nothing.  My lips swelled up like balloons and I was rushed to the dr.  I was able to breath but man was I scared.  Both my wife and I now carry an epi-pen everywhere. "

I'm a gynaecology resident doctor, and the level of misinformation in this thread and the blame on the poor girl is really killing me right now!!

OP if you're seeing this...it is highly highly unlikely that what you had was related to oral sex with the girl. The types of bacteria that grow in lady bits (the natural flora, or even if she has some infection going on) don't cause peritonsillar abscesses (what you had).

"I honestly wish this happened to the drunk driver that hit my mom and me. She was fine with no injuries. My mom only suffered a broken arm. I got to experience my first car accident, broken bone, heart attack, PTSD, organ failure and dialysis. My mom got to experience being called at home by the doctor to come claim my body because they didn't think I was going to make it.  I have scars on my neck from where multiple doctors failed to put ports into me. The meds did nothing so I felt everything and screamed for them to stop. But they couldn't. They had to put me in an operating room to get the port in. Meds didn't work that time either so of course I screamed my ass off. When I was finally well enough to go home I was told that my neck port had to be moved to my chest. Felt that one too. Also felt it when it was removed some weeks later. You know....blood smells awful. Like....metallic horribleness.

"When you look at the sun under normal conditions, your pupils are constricted because it's pretty bright out. The more light your eye sees, the more constricted it gets.

When there's an event like a solar eclipse out, your eyes dilate a lot more to get more light in to compensate for the darker conditions. People tend to get eye damage from looking at the sun during eclipses because their pupils are dilated and able to let more light in, and then the sun's rays get too bright and can cause damage.

Also, the retinas don't have pain receptors, so you won't get the reaction to turn your eyes away from the damage-causing source the way you would if you touched a hot stove. Submitting your eyes to the damage from sunlight without feeling pain means you think you can keep looking for longer than is safe - and keep doing more damage.

I had a similar accident expect the driver wasn't drunk and was my friend of 6 years. Along with many injuries like you sustained I'm also a paraplegic and will mostly likely never walk again. I don't want to be like the people who tell you atleast you aren't dead because I know just as well as you do that there are worse things than being dead. I just want to say that if you are learning how to walk again and making progress like that then you are much better off than me. My accident happened over a year ago now and I have had no progress whatsoever. I'm wishing you the best and a full recovery.

"Oh my dear Lord. This is horrible. This has happened with people and telescopes; they use a sun filter that's meant to be used *before* the magnification, after the magnification, and it eventually burns a hole instantly scorching the retina---it's literally impossible to react in time to save your retina, I forgot the math but it was way too fast for you to react. Said that, there are filters meant to be used after magnification."
"My brother was drunk driving back home from Pittsburgh when I was a junior in high school, about eight years ago. Cop caught him going 98 mph down a local highway, so he gunned it and the cop lost sight of him. He decided to turn down a small road off to the side in case my brother decided to deceive him, and he found his car smashed into a tree, on fire, with my brother unconscious and pinned to his seat with his legs in the flames. The cop managed to pry him out with the help of a neighbor who saw the wreck and an emt a few minutes before the car completely burst into flames.

My brother was in the hospital for 17 months. The doctors gave him a 5% chance of surviving the first night. He had horrifying injuries, internal and external. The impact crushed his face, damaged his heart, shattered his sternum and half of his ribs, collapsed one of his lungs, and he had third-degree burns on 98% of his legs, one of which he broke in six places, the other in two. He had skull and facial reconstruction surgery, heart surgery to repair a ripped valve, brain surgery twice to drain fluid and remove bone splinters, treated for third degree burns, had a toe amputated *(after almost a year of ""we may have to amputate your left leg"")*, both of his feet were fused at the ankle so he can't bend them, he has severe arthritis in both knees and hips, which means he'll never walk without a cane again , and has trouble breathing. He had a heart attack last summer. He's 32.

This shit's just not worth it. Just be thankful you survived.

Edit: I need to clarify something in regards to the 20-something pms I received last night. My brother is currently alive and doing well. He was in and out of the hospital after two days following the heart attack with no further complications since then. Actually in his final year of a bachelors degree starting here soon. 

I guess I could have made that a little clearer in the original comment."

"I'm only 17 about to turn 18 in September so I haven't returned to a job in any form. I graduated high school last year which was right after the accident. The accident happened in late June and I was in Yale and a rehab hospital until late August and went back to school on the very first day. At this point I'm focusing on therapy for a year and then going to college next year.  

I would be a lot worse off mentally without the help of my girlfriend. She stayed with me through the accident and has never shied away from any part of my disability. I have trouble staying continent and other issues that the average person wouldn't realize through no fault of their own. Without her help with many of my issues I would be in a much worse spot. As it stands right now I'm pursing many different options of therapy such as stem cells. That gives me a lot of hope to try and find progress through those options. If it weren't for things like that giving me hope I would probably kill myself. Living as a ""half person"" makes me feel as though I have lost so much potential and won't experience life to the fullest. One example of this is that I can't cum at all anymore which makes sex and masturbation pointless. I just keep thinking about things like this making the rest of my life ""less full"" as others.

Rather than black and white, they see dark blue, light blue, light yellow, dark yellow/brown, and of course gray and very dark gray.

I know that wasn't the point, it's just a fun fact."
"You're supposed to earn their trust if you want information, not drown them! I really do hope they're fine tho :c"
"This is good LPT for guys who like to go down on girls, I wouldn't have imagined this would have been an outcome of eating a girl out!! Glad you're okay mate, took one for the team. "
Scat cat... zippidy be bop 
"Well, with the broken arms and all..."
"I went across the fucking ocean, 6000mi, to an overseas American Uni cuz of this shit

It was enough

Haven't been home in a year and a half"
"With all this eclipse hype, I have to wonder who was the first person to figure out that looking directly at one was a really bad idea."
This creeped me out a little.
If he will get raped when half-life 3 is released he's got nothing to worry about.
"Wait, you shit uphill from your campsite? Are you a fucking moron? Dig a hole with a trowel dude. Downhill."
"Yeah, the more than offensive smell he noticed while they were still getting down was probably his own breath. Rotting tonsils don't smell good, nor happen quickly. I doubt it had anything to do with the girl. "
"You look at porn subreddits at work?

That's bold."
Sheddy Got Fingered.
"As someone who lost a baby to a drunk driver, and a fiance a short time later to suicide due to depression, it could have been much, much worse.  I'm so glad that you are okay.

I'm glad you're on the right road now.

If you had been hurt worse, the guilt your friend would have felt would have been unbearable.  You need to treasure that friendship."
"Ironically enough that might've 1) actually blocked some of the sunlight 2) made him close his eyes, out of pain, and 3) either not have been able to look at the sun with his eyes closed or 4) went blind from the sunscreen itself..."
"Could also tell her that even if it wasn't caused by her, you still had an infection and she should consider getting a check up, because maybe you passed it on to her. That way you can both be potentially embarrassed. "
"there's more than just a ""chance"" you permanently fucked up your eyes. It's leaning toward a more definite yes, since the retina does not possess pain receptors so it probably made you feel as if staring at it was not a problem since your eyes were not irritated. In addition, these dots are literally small burnt holes on your retina where they'll be permanently damaged, although I'm not 100% up to date on medical advances in this field... Lastly, if you see those spots immediately following staring into the eclipse, then that's very indicative of permanent damage...i haven't heard any other stories with a different ending..."
How am I gonna pay last month's rent? This month's rent?
"Can't rhyme ""shit"" with ""shit"" there, Nelly. "
Its the same for women going down on men as well.. anyone can get a bacterial infection. Stay safe my freaky friends.
"Hey doc, I shat on my cat and he tore up me balls so yeah...gonna need to get that looked at. "
"Instructions unclear, just gave my brown starfish a purple nurple."
"My husband is a goddamned idiot and is planning to look at the partial eclipse (we're well outside the totality zone) with just three pairs of sunglasses put together.  He knows he's not supposed to do that and I've tried to talk him out of it, and he doesn't care."
I have a Nexplanon birth control implant and I don't get periods at all anymore. It's so worth it. 
"Das gay

edit: dickbutt lol"
"She can still use a cup, she'll just need to change it more often."
Remain silent. For about 20 years. Then you can tell him.
"From what I understand, his eyelid was closed on the eye that felt the heat. He was using the binuculars like a monocular. So it was his eyelid that felt the heat.  "
Little Brown sliding hood.... Your friend is a genius
"Translation: I'm sorry to hear that sir, have you considered that maybe you aren't an idiot but that your music sucks?"
I love my penis I love my penis I ^love^my^penis
"Did the doctor tell you that she was the likely cause of this or did you not bring it up? Could have been something else, unless you're saying this is what happens when you eat out an infected ladydick"
Thank you this is really informative!! Eye damage is a very specific fear I have 
"I get the self righteousness of this response and how this feels like what he needs to be told, but ain't shit you can tell OP that life hasn't already. All you took away from this story is OP is a piece of shit and not how easy it is to be broken. I hope life is always kind to you since you can't find it in yourself to be kind to others. Good day sir."
"No one deserves to go blind and I'm really sorry that this happened to you. Yes your decisions were stupid and entirely your fault, but you're hardly the first person in the world to do something this shortsighted. You're just one of the unfortunate ones who ended up facing consequences for it.

Wishing you best at your appointment. Please take care of your eyes (and your body) and use better judgement in the future!"
Why is it always spiders? Why can't it be a butterfly? Bloody Hell.
"Holy hell, I was just pouring myself another drink before reading this and now I don't want to drink it. I poured it out and said it's not worth it, because I have drove buzzed but now no more. I hope you recover fast my friend, and remember we are all here for you. If you need a friend or someone to talk to, please message me. "
"Dad-level pain tolerance right there. ""I don't want to wake the kids. I'll just walk that shit off"". Disturb the queen's slumber? Hell no. I'd rather not hear about THAT for the next two weeks. You're a good man, charlie brown! (Hope for your speedy recovery and hopefully not your fappy hand, but if so, at least you get to experience ""the stranger"" for quite some time) lol"
No that's for recipes
"Am I the only one thats wondering why he wasnt charged with a DWI/DUI?

I had a friend who was in a bad accident after drinking and driving (fractured back, other broken bones etc.) And it didnt stop them for charging him.  Only difference is there were other people in the truck, and one was injuried. 

Either way...i dont get it

"
And what does coconut mean in Cuba?
"I had mexican for dinner,

I thought I was a winner. 

Until I woke up needing to shit,

All I could do was sit,

And I watch my shit congeal,

What a fucking ordeal."
"Well I did write the song with her in mind. I know her taste and while the song isn't about her, it's in a style that I know she likes. Thank you though, I appreciate it"
Þou'rt*
"Just a warning op, there will be a lingering sensation of the burn for a couple of days after this incident. It's Not going to pleasant, so stock up on some ice water to numb the pain. My personal favorite is frozen grapes, but any frozen fruit will do!"
OP didn't even get charged. Is this a Texas thing? I thought we took DUI seriously.
"Personally I love the idea. It didn't work and you blew $6k. Big fucking deal. You think anyone who has ""made it"" didn't fuck up and blow way more and make way worse decisions? 

Keep hustling. It's 6k. No big deal.

Keep hustling and keep working."
"I hope you have a better rest of your day! Most of my days are terrible, this one just also happened to be kinda funny/traumatizing"
Lights the molotov
Whew. That's my risky click for the day. 
Can we get a transcript of that conversation?
"Your girlfriend's not alone. I actually got my Nexplanon removed because after about a year, I would have my period every other month....for the ENTIRE month. Literally bleeding for a month and then not bleeding for a month. Rinse and repeat. Put up with it for three years and finally couldn't take it anymore.

Some ladies react differently to Nexplanon and their periods go away. I just wasn't one of them. Got an IUD now that I've had for almost three months now, and aside from occasional spotting, I'm feeling pretty good
"
"Don't say ""if you offended"" that's classic faux apology. Just say sorry."
"I once read on Reddit the greatest LPT I've ever seen - when at risk of having an infinity wipe, instead,  pinch from top to bottom within your buttcrack.  This really works and now my anus is always squeaky clean."
Go vandalize your own sign or do a publicity stunt. That's the real way to go viral. 
"I hope you don't mind the question - my wife says her menstrual cycle is heavy, could she use one of these cups, or is it more for lighter periods?

Thanks for all the replies. I'll relay this info to her :)"
"Holy shit, that's horrifying...and perfect."
"Remind him that his disability insurance will not cover intentional injuries, and you will have difficulty supporting him on your own income.

Oh, he hasn't purchased disability insurance?  Suddenly he has a second thing to think through on how he's risking YOU for his foolishness.

(You can also ask if he looked through the non-eclipsed sun with three sunglasses together, as doing so will be even worse than that for his eyes during the partial eclipse.)"
"But fingering yourself isn't necessarily gay, is it? I mean, wanting to jack yourself off is not gay, whereas wanting to jack someone else off is. I'd argue that the same goes for putting your finger in your butthole."
"She's not offended, she's embarrassed. Even if you handled telling her perfectly, she'd most likely feel humiliated to find out her lady parts are shady parts."
"Right now I work in Neuroscience at a large University, currently I've been working with rodents, but I love working with birds.

Day to day I spend time reading, researching and setting up experiments to ""ask"" the animals questions. For example, I might give them two types of food to see which they prefer."
Hell yeah my dude 
"Well, fuck. I told my parents and we are going to see an optician soon. "
Dis guy... He gays 
"She didn't even offer you a helping hand, how rude."
You really an ornithologist? I'm a teenager and I love birds and ornithology is a field I kind of want to go into. What do you do for your day to day job?
I'm just glad your selfishness didn't cause the death or injury of another person. My life is ruined because of a selfish shit like you; most days I wish they had killed me. 
"I might mention this on your next eye exam tho. From all these warnings, I did some research and apparently the damage can commonly take some time to set in. Sometimes aging will make the damage more visible.

I dont mean to scare you and if you dont have any symptoms of damage, thats obviously good but I would tell your eye doctor still."
I am not a smart man.
"i could find it by googling '“HEY KYLIE” followed by “I didn’t know how to get your attention so I bought this billboard”'

So that's something..."
