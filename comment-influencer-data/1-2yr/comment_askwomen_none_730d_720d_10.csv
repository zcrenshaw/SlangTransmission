"I got married to my best friend. He was a sweet guy that helped mw get on my feet in a new city. Was always there for me when I needed him emotionally and well physically. We were friends with benefits. I wasn't in love but I thought hey this is working out and we make a great team. I was also there for him when he needed me and so one day I proposed the idea to him to get married. I was like ""hey this seems to be working out. Wanna get married?"" He said sure. And the following year we got married. We are 11 years in and are still the best of friends and make an awesome team. So it worked out. And that friendship grew into love. And I love him deeply and unconditionally. I can't imagine my life without him. "
"This is a side job. When I was in college I was a ""fake patient"" (it had a fancy name, sorry I forgot) a lot of medical schools have this. It paid really well but was sporadic, perfect for college. Basically I spent an hour in the office getting briefed on the character and then a few hours a few days later playing the character with med students. It was all very controlled in fake exam rooms with cameras and after each student I had to fill out a survey. I had a lot of fun doing it and the money was great. I wish I had time to do it again."
"Yep. I was at a bar waiting for a friend of mine and this guy came up and started trying to talk to me.  I ignored him and didn't make eye contact, and he just kept saying I was playing hard to get, how that's just gonna make him try harder, he likes a challenge, etc. Well some other guy I didn't know came up and said, ""Ready to go if you are."" I looked at him like YES PLEASE THANK YOU and he took me outside and said he was sorry but that guy was being weird and he could tell I was bothered. I said thanks, he left, and I lit up a cigarette. My friend got there as I was thanking him and I told her we should probably go somewhere else. I never found out the guys name or anything and I never saw him again."
"My friend has a heart condition and was starting to have an especially rough time with it a few years ago, but didn't have insurance. She ended up marrying her best friend to get on his insurance (she's a lesbian and he's gay, but at the time in their state they weren't able to marry who they would have wanted anyway).

They've since gotten divorced, but she kept his last name because them being close friends didn't change in the least, and she saw it as a way of thanking him for what he did for her."
"A guy I play DND with is a ""nice guy"" he is 33, morbidly obese, balding, working in IT, lives with his mom and he seems to think he deserves a Norse goddess of a woman who will stroke his ego and be his sex toy. 
 
When we introduce him to women who he would actually get along with he does all but recoil in disgust. ""Do you guys hate me?"" 


He said he would even settle for ""a girl like bakedbride"". 

I'm 5'2"", 125lbs, fit, I have a stable career and I own a home with my husband, I'm a great cook with tons of hobbies. 


He once asked my husband's advice on how to get someone like me or better because I'm apparently ""the lowest he will go"" 


My husband reminded him that when he started dating me I was a fat, underemployed socially awkward young woman with a bit of a drinking problem (that's been fixed for a long time now). and that my husband was only a 5'6"" Chinese very fit private in the Canadian military who was also socially awkward and a gamer. He told him to ""lower his standards to a realistic level and grow as a couple"" 

NOPE. Dude still ogles and whines to every 8-10/10 he sees about how he is such a nice guy who would treat her perfectly. And when she doesn't respond he turns into such a piece of shit to them. 

He's already received 2/3 warnings about his behaviour in the group. One more and he's gone "
"I had an arranged marriage. I am terribly lonely. We have sex, but there is no romance. He doesn't hold my hand, cuddle with me in bed, kisses aren't a thing.  When we are over at his family's I sit there and just listen I don't exist unless someone needs tea or food or someone to blame. I hold my pillow at night and dream of running away and finding someone who loves me. "
"Psuedo feminism. When folks claim to be promoting feminism, but are actually promoting the opposite of that.

Examples: 

""Real women have curves""

""Men are all obsessed with sex, whereas women aren't and so are better""

""People who like ballet, literature, and fashion are inherently worse than me, a woman who likes baseball, the sciences, and cars.""

""Women are magical beings who have no flaws, and men are beasts who are driven by anger.""


I could go on. I know I believed some of these things as a young teenager and I'm still constantly reading about feminist theory. "
"A couple of years ago, I had a girlfriend who was into kinkier stuff than I was. One morning, I woke up tied down to the bed, her on top of me, and I was in a lot of pain. She was ""trying something new"". I still have scars from her, a restraining order, and enough emotional damage that I'm not sure I can ever be with a woman again. Which makes me sad, since I'm bisexual and really like women. "
"I work for Comcast. Every time you move you're considered to be a ""new customer"" and are eligible for new customer pricing. Even if you're in a contract. "
"I always answer ""good riddance, all the assholes who think that women are just sex and cooking will get out of the dating pool and leave us the fuck alone.""

Then they get real mad."
"I was molested by other girls my age when I was about 9. They undressed me on school grounds and took pictures of me with their phones. None of them were being molested (this was a group of about 15 girls), just did it out of pure hate because I was ""the weird girl"" and also had breasts when none of them  had them yet.

The same girls then made me strip and dance for them and molested me during a sleepover, then beat me up. I was kicked out of that sleepover *for being naked and beaten up*.

It made me distrust girls my age for the longest time, especially girls with their same features for some reason."
"""Our target demographic is female... MAKE IT PINK OUR WORK HERE IS DONE!""

so fucking lazy"
"He just liked me so much.   It was annoying.  Like he was relentless in his pursuit of a relationship. I wasn't into it after getting dumped by a long term boyfriend. 

But then,  he offered to take my down syndrome brother to a hockey game.  And afterwards, my mom called him and asked where she should pick him up.  My SO just said ""no, it's cool, he's just gonna play video games at my house and I'll let him crash here if he wants"".  

People are very good to my brother. But to my SO, my brother was just a normal friend.  Still, 9 years later (yeah, I fell hard after that), my SO and brother hang out all the time without me and without any obligation.  It melts me.

Edit:typo"
"Getting groceries - you cannot buy that! You cannot take that! You cannot eat that! Those various things are bad for the baby. 
Oddest of all was getting pepto for a family member and an older woman physically trying to stop me from buying it. She said I was going to harm my baby. She was truly distraught. "
"Retailers forcing me to click some passive aggressive statement, like, ""no, I DON'T want to receive the latest deals"" in order to close a popup on their website.

"I wouldn't be able to stop myself. ""What do you even bring to the table? Oh, you'd treat her nice? That's a really low bar. Any other good qualities? No? Just being the most basic description of a decent person? Sorry, you don't get a cookie for treating someone with respect, that's like the baseline of human decency."" But I also used to know this guy and my patience wore thin real quick. "
"I kinda wonder if you guys were in love before you married, just a different kind. Not lightning bolts but the emotional intimacy kind. It's my goal to have a relationship like that.  "

My boss also liked to rub my belly, like literally rub. He had a history of inappropriate remarks.

For bizarre, I also got handed a flyer about teen pregnancy support, which would have been useful for some women. I was 28. In the person's defense I was walking near a high school, as in walking by. I don't look 16.

"
"I'm not quite there yet at 48, but I'll take a stab at some answers: 

- Everyone who says you should wear sunscreen is right. Being a largely nocturnal goth kid in high school and college has saved my skin, and it would be in even better shape if I'd been scrupulous about wearing it every day throughout adulthood.
- If you wear makeup, experiment with it. You don't have to adhere to whatever's trendy as long as what you do wear is expertly applied and truly suits your face. 
- Eyes naturally get more hooded over time. It's okay to put away the winged liner and look for different techniques if and when it happens. 
- Cultivate a sense of personal style. I spent so many years chasing after elusive ideals of beauty instead of perfecting my sense of style. Not everyone can be model-beautiful, but memorable style is something any of us can achieve. 
- *Never* let anyone tell you you have to cut your hair sensibly short past a certain age. Or stop wearing black eyeliner. Or stop wearing lipstick. Or stop wearing colorful makeup in general. You don't have to put away the paint-box after 35 (or 40, or 45). "

"I had a friends boyfriend shove himself between me and a creepy fella at a music festival. The creepy dude got annoyed and literally reached around the guy to shove his hand down my tanktop. Friends boyfriend clamped down on the offending hand with his sweaty armpit and grinned in his face. Creepy dude ran away.

I only caught the second part of the incident, but needless to say friends boyfriend got my star rating and when friend asked what I thought of him, he got a fantastic review.   "
"I don't know about said but women would just touch my belly.  I would be in Target, minding my own business, and a little old lady would have her hand on me asking if it was a boy or girl. I was so shocked I just answered her the first time it happened. 

How is that ok? It's like me walking around the store randomly smelling people's hair saying ""ooo is that coconut?""

"**He took me to the hospital.**

A couple months before I started dating him, I came to the realization that being single was fucking awesome! No compromise, no drama, just me being selfish all day every day!

But then a couple of my co-workers kept pestering to give me a makeover, so I finally relented. Her roommate was chilling in the livingroom at the time and we said maybe three sentences to each other and then went our separate ways. Apparently he liked me enough to ask his roommate for my number and ask me out. I initially wanted to say 'no' on the grounds that I didn't know him. But I said yes because I never had a date so it would be an experience.

I wasn't really impressed with him, but he wasn't throwing red flags at me, so I figured I'd give him two or three more dates to see if I could like him enough to pursue a relationship. If not, I'd just break it off and tell him we weren't clicking and better luck next time.

After date #2, I got what I thought was vertigo. I couldn't even crawl, much less drive, so I called my co-worker to see if she could drive me to a clinic. She sent him to do it. 

He drove me to two different clinics before we resigned to go to the hospital. He stayed with me for as long as he could (a few hours) before he finally had to leave. 

I was so touched by his compassion and selflessness that I decided to open my heart. Four years later, we're still going strong."
"Not to get political, but...fuck it, I will. A woman could never have five kids with three husbands, talk about grabbing men by the crotch, be completely obnoxious and unprepared for any political question, talk down to every political opponent, lie, and still be considered completely acceptable to run for *any* political office, much less the highest in the land.

She also couldn't get into office, create a cabinet full of people who are almost all white women, make decisions on mens' healthcare and rights while posing for pictures with her cabinet of happy women, etc. There's still a million things women cannot do in this country.

Phew, feels good to get that out."
"Your bank has the right to refuse money covered in blood, other bodily fluids, that smells of marijuana, and if it's wet.

"If you're looking for a care home for your aging parent or grandparent, visit the facility during all shifts (usually 7-3, 3-11, and 11-7) on different days of the week, and not on an official tour with an administrator or director of resident care. See what's going on. Do rooms or hallways smell? Are nurses and CNAs ignoring call buttons? Do trashcans have used briefs in them? Are a lot of residents in bed in the middle of the day (if they're not sleeping or near death, residents should be out of bed)? Are there linens or towels thrown on floors in residents' rooms? All of these things are red flags that indicate the residents probably aren't receiving proper care or the facility is too short staffed to properly care for those they have."

People think it's acceptable to ask extremely personal questions and give ignorant unsolicited advice when you're pregnant. I'm an asshole so I always give the most off putting answers I could imagine. I'm not sure why carrying another human being inside your body makes people think they have the right to touch you and ask things they would never consider asking someone else. It's extremely annoying. It's also really funny to tell someone no when they ask to touch your belly or tell them to mind their own business if they ask inappropriate questions. They get all angry and flustered and I just give them a dead eyed stare to make things that little bit more uncomfortable. 
"It was at a pub in Dublin. I was there by myself, just wanted a Guinness and to listen to the trad session, when this bloke plops down in the seat next to mine. Kept trying to make conversation, which I wasn't really having and the more I ignored him, the more enraged he got. Eventually he grabbed my arm to get me to look at him and I was getting ready to punch him when he sort of flew away and out of his seat. Another bloke had grabbed him by the shoulder and hoisted him out of the chair. It ended up being a bit of an exchange between them but the first guy got thrown out in the end. 

I insisted on buying my ""saviour"" a beer and we sat and talked together, and ended up listening to the session together. It was nice. "
The Fault in Our Stars. Not the most pretentious but it's definitely up there.
"In 9th grade, my SO was a grubby, argumentative, scruffy looking, Kurt-Cobain-wannabe who played bass in a garage band after school. I had a crush on the drummer and would often come to hang out while they practiced. 
He didn't like practicing in front of girls I guess, so he made it very uncomfortable for me to be there by just always being snotty and obnoxious towards me. Like, he would just argue with me *relentlessly* about any and every insignificant thing and be generally contrary in effort to make me uncomfortable. He was VERY good at it too:/. 
One day after practice we all went to eat at our usual neighborhood diner and for some reason that I'll never understand, one of our ""friends"", perhaps in an attempt to bond with my SO, started verbally attacking me in front of a large group of our peers, proclaiming that I was an idiot, failing several classes, a poser, couldn't play guitar at all, and some other awful things that I can't really remember the details of, but I remember that it hurt a TON and presented me as being trashy. 
I cried of course. Because in 9th grade, this really *is* a big deal and really *does* feel like the end of the world. 
Much to my surprise, my SO defended me loudly, publicly, and thoroughly even in the days after it happened. We started dating shortly after that and are still together (married now) 22 years later. 
For the record: I absolutely could play guitar and still can. I just don't like playing in front of crowds "
"My mom sometimes did an awesome thing when I was a kid. 

There would be days when we both woke up grumpy and were grousing at each other, and she would suddenly say we needed to ""start over"". So we would put our pajamas back on and get back in bed and pretend to wake/get up all over again. It always worked to help us restart on the right foot, and the kid in me loved the playfulness of it. "
"I'm on my second pregnancy with twins. 

My aunt fondled my breasts in a room filled with family last week. She commented ""omg they're so small I thought they'd be bigger"". I don't think I've ever slapped a hand away so sharply - I could've broken the sound barrier with the crack it made. Stupid insipid woman. "
"A month or so ago there was a guy that asked if women can actually love, and in the text he basically said that he had seen ""some people"" say that women are incapable of genuine love and was looking for a female perspective.

I asked him where he had heard that. I already knew but was wondering if he'd be honest. He never answered."
"I got married because I wanted to run away from my family and my home country. He was older and knew why I was doing it and he was fine with it. I liked him a lot, but love didn't have much to do with our marriage."

"When he dumped his awful ex-girlfriend he was a completely different person. She was physically and emotionally abusive and he was in such a dark place. She also cheated on him several times. The first time I met him I was hanging out with his roommates and he stormed in. They tried to introduce me but he wasnt in a place to meet a new person so just said ""hi"" like he was obligated and then stormed to his room and slammed the door. She came in minutes later and the group just sat their listening to them scream at each other. They said she was always like that. Anyways, they broke up and he invited me to hang out randomly and the rest is history. Our 10th anniversary is this month. Since that initial encounter I've never heard him raise his voice, storm around or display any intense anger. He's so calm but she made him something he wasn't. "
Not very well. Finding out people I care about don't believe in same sex marriage is pretty heart breaking. I'm not exactly out to most people either so it's lots of biting my tongue and a tight feeling in my chest 24/7.

About four times a year I get asked to go up to the hospital to act as a patient for medical student exams.

My friend was in an arranged marriage. Her husband beat the shit out of her on the first day of their honeymoon then got a knife and started threatening to cut his wrists if she left him. It was pretty horrendous. After a year of that treatment she went to see her imam and he sorted out her divorce. 
"Was a server. This weird guy told me my baby belly looked amazing (under my pressed, double-buttoned chef's coat) and kept trying to touch it. This progressed to the point where I stood across the table from him anytime I had to interact with him. Serious creep vibes. 


Edit: forgot to mention that I didn't think too much about it after the table left until my husband reminded me that night (after I told him about it) that some guys have a fetish for pregnancy. THAT'S what cemented the memory in my head and made it even creepier. "
"I was reading a health article once on some website and a pop up appeared. It was asking if I wanted to buy some fitness book and learn about body shapes or some shit. To get it to go away the options were ""Yes! I care about my fitness and would love to get in shape!"" or ""No! I'm okay with being unhealthy and don't mind the way my body looks.""

"[Scopist](https://www.courtreporteredu.org/scopist/)

Basically you get the unedited transcripts from court reporters of deposition or trial testimony and you go through it word by word, most of the time while listening to time-synced audio, and fix it up.  Find all the spellings of proper names and technical terms, fix untranslated steno, make sure speakers are identified properly, apply proper formatting, add in missed words, fix misheard words, make sure the punctuation is all the way it needs to be.  It's tedious but it isn't rocket science.

If you have really solid grammar skills, a really good work ethic, self-discipline, and a perfectionist streak, it's a really good gig.  I make just shy of six figures and I've been doing this for nearly 15 years. The problem is there are a lot of BAD scopists, so it's hard to get clients to trust you enough to give you a chance, but if you do the job well and don't miss deadlines, you'll be highly sought after."

"Doing some ""research"" on a product online might still not help get you the best bang for your buck. There is an entire industry spending $$$$ to make sure that when you ""research"" something, they come out ahead of the competition. From people paying for fake reviews of products (it's cheaper than you think), to gaming search engines to bury their competitors (if you are crafty, you can get Google to change their phone number for yours on their business listing and steal their potential customers), to promoted BS on social media (again, so cheap), to over optimizing your Amazon listing, to outright lying...


It's surprisingly cheap and easy to make your product look good on the internet if you know what you are doing."

"Yes. We got married after few months of knowing each other as I was egar to go away. He was objectively right man at the right time living in the right city. He became subjectively perfect after we got to know each other. Now I know that this could end up horribly wrong, but at least once in my life I got lucky. He jokes that he wanted to marry me because he wanted free holidays in my home country, I say that I wanted to marry because I wanted his last name.

I love both my parents, but now I'm helping my mom and dad get a divorce/separation so they can have better individual lives. I will also support if they find other SO's in their lives going forward.

"I don't really refer to my sexual assault as rape even though by many definitions it was. It just doesn't seem fair because other people have experienced rape on so much worse a level than my experience. I am bisexual but the woman was one of my first queer sexual experiences. After it happened I didn't sleep with another woman for almost 5 years. I blamed myself. I thought, if I wasn't bisexual, this wouldn't have happened. Before being assaulted by that woman, I had been attracted to her. Our kissing was consensual, but the sex that followed wasn't. It made me really resent my queerness. I was frustrated by the lesbian community (in my area at the time) for their implications that men were the enemy, that women were safe sex partners, that sex between women is gentle and consensual. I thought I would never have sex again. I tried to be okay with that idea. After awhile I met a nice guy who had experienced assault from a male friend of his. I thought we would have an understanding sexual relationship because we had s great intimate friendship, but our sex life was fucked up and it was my fault. I was fucked up, for a lot of reasons, and it took a long time and a lot of therapy before I learned how to be a good sexual and romantic partner. If anyone is dealing with this, and want to talk, DM me.

"I know a guy who's lovely, but just has an utterly bizarre outlook on life. He's got a weird sort of *need* to see the best of everything: he only likes the 'best' sports team, clothes brand, car etc. and if something happens like the best sports team doesn't win a game, it's almost like it doesn't compute, or he feels cheated or something.

Then he handles his life in a way where he seems to focus so much on getting married, getting the right job, buying a house etc. that he ploughs on without a second thought as to whether what he's doing will *actually* make him happy.

He recently separated from his wife (who was always a terrible match for him- very controlling and unwilling to compromise) because she was desperate for a kid, and he wanted to wait for a few years to have one. She can't wait, because she's quickly clocking up the years past 30, and has to make a move. He's so obsessed with getting a house on time with his little life plan that he begins divorce proceedings rather than actually try to fix their marriage. Then he wonders why he's fucking miserable over the following weeks, gets sick of said misery and goes crawling back to her a month later, basically willing to have kids now just to avoid being alone.

Apologies if that last paragraph is a bit rambling. I've no idea whether to tell him to get back together with her, to leave her or just to keep schtum about it. I'm sick to the back teeth of his shit right now though."

"Inpatient psychiatric hospitalization is, most of the time, just a way to ensure the patient or society's immediate safety by removing the patient temporarily from his or her environment.

"I got married because I was teen mom and I wanted to proved to my family and my peers that I was mature and that I didn't ""screw up"" my life. I did think I loved him, but looking back I really couldn't understand what marriage entails at 18 years old. We were married for three years before divorcing because we were not compatible and grew in different directions. I'm glad we did it though. He's more like a brother to me and our daughter can see that we both love her very much. I am far more choosy about partners now and I don't think I would have been if I didn't make the mistake of marrying the wrong person so early. I stayed single for five years. Now I have a wonderful boyfriend who has the same outlook on life and similar goals. I never would have thought I deserved that if I didn't experience the polar opposite."

She was about 9, lived next door, and would knock on our back patio door occasionally to play with me.  Seemed innocent enough but I know at one point my parents caught her ""being inappropriate"" and she wasn't allowed back after that.  They suspected she was being molested at home and acting it out on me.  All I remember was that she got on top of me and ""played husband and wife"" but I don't know if it went beyond that.  Either way, it hasn't affected me at all.  I think if I had been older with more memory, it might have."
"I actually hated my husband when we first met. He is the cousin of one of my best friends and happens to be from another country. It was completely bizarre to me that their family would come and stay for over a month and in that time my friend could never hang out. The few times I met his cousin, he would always have a one-up type attitude as his family was wealthy and would make comments as such. 

Years later he came to go to university near by and I was less than thrilled of my friend hanging out with him almost every weekend. I decided to get over it and just go along. My now husband was very different. He had been in our country for a while by this time and seemed to have learned to be more humble. I noticed and when later my roommate asked if he could come to our party I said sure. He ended up teaching me to play my guitar that night and it just went from there. Next year will be 10 years together!"

"I had a surprise baby at 47, (got pregnant when I was still 46).  The amount of invasive comments we were confronted by still astounds me.  We already had three sons.  Much of the commentary was that we must be making a desperate last minute attempt for a little girl.  This was really something that did not enter into it.  We would be delighted with whatever gender any of our kids were, and no, we had not tried.  One woman kept asking me if I knew where babies came from.  I told her, in incredulous tones, that why, yes, we DID know where babies came from and since my husband and I had been together 18 years and went at sex like starved rats in a peach barrel, we could not understand why we only had three sons, and that this was a point of emotional agony for us.  Her eyes grew wide and she shut up after that :-) 

Then came the worriers.  The people who could not stop making gloomy predictions that due to our advanced ages our kid was likely to be riven with defects.  I have a cousin who sent me pamphlets on the chances of this, and where to go for an abortion past the first trimester. She made my pregnancy a topic of general conversation among the extended family.  I am not the only one in our family she told should abort.  Both kids are healthy and wonderful, but she will never admit she was wrong.  (""You took a real chance..."")  Like we were ignorant gits with no access to medical screenings.  She also told me for years that one son who was a slight lad should get growth hormones.  We ignored that bit of unsolicited advice, too, and he is now a strapping guy, well over 6'.  "

"I had turned him down for a date twice. It's not that I didn't like him, I just wasn't ready for dating yet as I'd just left another relationship. That and he wasn't really my type. Like, at all. So after the 2nd time, he said something like ""ok, but if you ever change your mind, I'll be right here"". We worked together at the time, so life continued as it does. He was still very kind to me. Never resentful. Not pushy or in any way trying to make thinks uncomfortable. He was a gentleman about the whole thing, which in my experience was not the norm for most men. So about a month later, I find a red bull and a little daisy he had picked outside snuck into the pocket of my purse. I knew he had done it so I asked him what it was for and he said ""well I know how much you like daisies and red bulls"". It's such a silly, small thing but that along with his graciousness even after I had rejected him really impressed and intrigued me. He wasn't anything like I thought he'd be and I fell in love with him. Still am 3 1/2 years later :) https://imgur.com/wZEaiym.jpg "

"I didn't really dislike him, but when I first met him he was having a very heated conversation over the phone with his ex about their daughter. When I met him again about five years later we actually got on really well. I've since learnt from everyone who has ever encountered his ex that she is extremely difficult and even the politest of his friends refer to her as Beelzebub. "
"The big one that immediately popped into my head:

- physical intimacy between friends

Also: 

- wearing what's thought of as the other gender's clothing. Women can get away with pants or a suit more than men can with a dress. Even extra butch women can ""get away"" with their clothes more easily than men in dresses. 

- being more emotional. Not necessarily bad emotions, just more open with one's feelings

- talking to random kids. My husband would never feel too comfortable chatting with some kid who approaches him, but I'm totally cool with a kid coming up to me and me asking them their name, where their parents are, etc. Happened on one occasion when a 4 or 5 year old ran up to me and I took her hand and talked to her and led her to the info desk. The general consensus in my friend group was that guys would feel uncomfortable and ask another woman for help

- not knowing how to drive or be ""handy"". I mean, men can get away with it, but to a much lesser degree"
"I'm not sure if this the *biggest* thing, but I really wish I could go out without constantly assessing threat levels and escape routes. "
I never understood why people called me selfish for not wanting children. Like every fertile woman capable of giving birth just automatically becomes obligated to bear a child at some point? The world is overpopulated enough and there are lots of kids without parents so why would i bring in a kid when i don't even want one
"I'm 21 now. Started when I was four and she was my older cousin. Sexually assaulted me several times throughout my childhood.  Threatened me to keep it secret.  I've always been off of the whole sex thing for most of my life.  I trouble with wanting to get intimate with people, especially any sort of physical contact.  I have a very big ""don't touch me"" policy.

Overall, I tried not to put too much thought into it. It's something that happened, but I don't want to acknowledge happened. I haven't seen a therapist about it.  I thought I was finally moving forward until I was hanging out with her and her boyfriend on night and she was like ""hey, remember how you use to make me kiss you and touch you when you little"".  I haven't been able to face her since.  I get sick whenever I think about it.  I feel like I'm losing my mind. That's not how I remember it at all. I feel crazy."

"Feeding your dog or cat human food is just really not good for your pet. It's not ~insider knowledge~ but I think most people don't think it's that big of a deal. 

The number of pets we see come in with pancreatitis or fatty liver or hypothyroidism is just sad. People think obese animals are cute and hilarious until they see the bill for the medical treatments required to keep the animal in a semi-comfortable existence, and then we end up having to put a middle aged animal down because the owner can't justify paying more than $50 for their pet. 

The vet is 9 times out of 10 not trying to ""steal"" your money. Most of the reasons people come into the vet are for 100% preventable things, like not feeding your dog bacon scraps or letting them eat your remaining steak bone. Sometimes it's genetic predispositions, but really you can save yourself a lot of unnecessary vet trips by taking advantage of preventative healthcare for pet. So when we suggest a flea treatment or heartworm preventative, trust us. RVTs and vets get paid nothing compared to human medicine, so we're definitely not in this profession for the money. 

Here's a hot insider tip. One year of heartworm prevention is $170. Heartworm treatment, including testing, x-rays, surgery, medications is about $4000 depending on the state. "
Stop comparing themselves to other women.
"Okay, I hate to be all ""Back in my day,"" but Halloween makes me really sad every year because no one really trick or treats anymore.  I'm 33, I've bought candy every year since I got my first apartment at 19, and I have had like 10 trick or treaters in that time period.  This is through like 8 different cities, too.  

I guess everyone just goes to mass trick or treating events at schools, churches, parking lots, wherever.  

So I decorate less and less every year.  I'm not even going to get candy this year since I just end up eating it all.  

Sorry for the Debbie Downer moment and I know kids still trick or treat in some areas (my parents have lived in small towns and they always get a bunch), it's just that I was *really* looking forward to giving out candy as an adult."

Might as well have some bloody conviction.

There are defs people in contemporary Australia who would deny human rights to our indigenous population and other minority groups... it bothers me personally that these people are allowed a voice in a matter of equal rights. (Although that's getting into murky territory with free speech, and we should be allowed free speech, without which we would lack such comedic gems as the Say No campaign's television ad)


Also just as a little aside, a totally bloodless thought, from a purely logical standpoint I think legalising marriage for same-sex couples will be bomb for our economy, weddings=$$$ and I know quite a few couples just twiddling their thumbs waiting for the day it's legal for me and all my bogan pals to descend on their hometown, stay in their motels, buy their alcohol and eat all their KFC etc during their wedding weekend... ca-ching!

All in all, I hope this survey encourages lots of progressive young people to register to vote and marks a turning tide in Australian politics. "

But there was also a couple times where they went on to ask questions like ""Is the father still in the picture?"" or ""Are you and the father together?"" That, I thought was insanely rude and presumptuous of them. I don't really think I'd have been asked things like that if I looked a little older. "

She goes with the best friend who lack Spark, for some also plot reasons, but never once regrets the decision and ends up in the most loving and supportive relationship that lasts through everything because their love only grows and deepens the longer they're together. That really stuck with me, that love doesn't *have* to be fireworks and rainbows and obsessive thoughts, a quieter kind of love built on acceptance and commitment and understanding can work out better over a lifetime than romantic blaze that may burn out. In fact, several of her romance plots are based on the whole ""understanding and acceptance and long term commitment"" thing vs ""fireworks and sparks and I Must Have You""."

"I was indifferent when I met him. I was only a month out of a 4.5 year abusive relationship, so I was not looking and I wasn't interested. Besides, he was rocking the ""I'm in year 3 of my PhD and have officially stopped caring"" look: long unkempt hair and beard, mostly only wore ratty t-shirts and cargo shorts to class, and didn't talk much (which I later found out was because he was hungover most of the time).

Then about 2 months after I met him, he cleaned himself up and actually seemed put together. He began talking in class and it turned out he had funny things to say. I was still relatively indifferent, but agreed when he asked to get drinks after the final (not as a date, just as a yay we made it through this brutal class). Started hanging out with him and his friends because I'd lost most of mine in the breakup and between full-time work and full-time grad school, I hadn't really had time to make any in a few months.

Turns out I really like the guy because we just celebrated our 1-year wedding anniversary last weekend."

"The MLM industry is worse than you probably realize. Infinitely shadier. If you can imagine.

A few things, because people are PMing me: 

- I worked in corporate marketing for a VERY well-known mlm company. 

- The ones at the ""top"" are almost always professional MLMers (regardless of the ""I was so broke just like you"" story they tell) who hop from company to company to get in on the ground level, then make hundreds of thousands (if not millions) and then on to the next one. When people don't make money after signing up, they're told it's because they're not ""working the business"" and they need to go to all the seminars and conventions (which are usually held in places like Hawaii that is very expensive to fly to). They end up getting into debt over their stupid ""business.""

- There are a lot of dirty politics that go on behind the scenes to keep their top earners happy, since they're always threatening to jump ship. For example, if there is a promotion going on (example: new people who sign up 10 people in 30 days get a $10k bonus), they will ""award"" the bonus to people who didn't even sign anyone up, just to help someone else in their upline ""advance"" to the next level in order to keep them happy. (Everyone in the upline gets money when someone is signed up) So the people who are legitimately working hard are screwed over. "

"I think that their pregnancy fears are really different from mine. Being afraid of pregnancy is normal across the board but what actual aspect of it that they're afraid of is pretty different. For me, it's fear of getting pregnant, the physical impact it will have on my body, and before I was ready for kids, fear of having an abortion (which I would have done but all medical procedures freak me out). For the guys in my life, there's a fear of lack of control -- once they get a woman pregnant, it's ultimately her choice whether to continue with the pregnancy -- and this fear of how to support a kid that I know women have too, but seems to be a lot more acute among my male friends. I mean, I get it, but it's not how fear of pregnancy manifests for me personally, so it's an interesting difference in experience. "

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

- Most of our clothes have pockets. Most of my *dresses* have pockets. I don't understand this pocket issue and why US companies are not on board with this.

- I wouldn't say that I'm ""sick"" of it, because I think it's important, but threads about abortion, birth control, and family planning are very US-centric. All this stuff is available on the NHS at (almost) any age (I assume they would be reticent if you were like, 11, and would be looking to check for another problem). I got my birth control free from age 14. The nurse encouraged me to tell my mother, warning me: ""They have a way of finding out"", but didn't push the issue. (She was right, my Mam found out).

"It's a comment I've made before, but I'll reiterate it. 

When I did business studies at GCSE we were taught about a few different motivation theories. One of them (can't remember the name) was that there are so called ""hygiene factors"". 

The idea is that these hygiene factors won't motivated you, but screwing them up is a huge demotivator. So if your bathroom is spotless you're not really going to increase worker production, but having a literal shithole will demotivate people. Nobody is going to go ""I love this job because they pay on time"" but it'll surely lower production if you don't. 

Being ""nice"" is a hygiene factor. It's something that nobody is going to write home about but if you're just a plain asshole it'll turn people away. Someone saying ""hey, I'm nice"" is like an employer saying ""hey, I pay on time"". "
"I would assume that anyone who asks a question like this must suffer from a lack of familiarity with Mr. King's extensive bibliography, or, perhaps, that they've merely watched the movies instead of delving into the complex, richly detailed lives of, say, Lisey Landon, or Donna Trenton, Annie Wilkes, Carrie White. I would have to think they haven't met Rose the Hat, yet, or Julia Shemway, or Wendy Torrance, haven't looked them in the eyes and recognized women in their own lives, people they sat next to in school, or share a cubicle with, or hate running in to at the grocers, because in print, some of these ladies might sometimes be intolerable - but only the way that any intolerable person is, not for being a woman, or a product of bad writing, but for being the sort of human who is intolerable regardless of it, whether we're in Room 237 at the Overlook or Under the Dome, or somewhere seemingly mundane, like Castle Rock, or even Derry.

His legacy speaks for itself - and it speaks nothing of an inability to write female characters, and it speaks nothing of something as mundane as blatant rampant authorial objectification.  It speaks to iconic women, some terrifying, or pitiable, or brave, or foolish, but all together creating a complex and compelling world where women can be so many different things - victim, villain, hero, enabler. Where they may be objectified, or victimized, or dehumanized, but they are not objects, and are not subhuman, and they are more than just the one thing - more than just a victim or just a villain or just any one thing, because nobody is just one thing. 

Certainly there are men in his books, and women, that view other women as objects, or means to an end, or obstacles, or subhuman. To include such flawed, complex people - especially as the true horror of a story featuring a giant extraterrestrial dome, or a rabid dog, or an angry ghost   - isn't bad writing. It's excellent writing. Those people exist. They are out there. They're here, too - online, on Reddit, in our subreddits, and our real lives. 

In his villains, and heroes, and his extended cast, we see our neighbors, our friends, our enemies, maybe even, sometimes, ourselves. 

That's pretty badass writing, if you ask me, regardless of gender."

"Speaking as a lab environmental health and safety rep: If you genuinely need something disinfected, you probably want to use 10% bleach for at least 15 minutes. There are other disinfectants that work as well, but bleach has the best combo of being widely available and extremely effective. 70% ethanol (and similar isopropanol solutions) only kills certain kinds of bacteria- the ""99.99% of germs!"" marketing you see on hand sanitizer and many household cleaners typically means ""99.9% of this particularly easy-to-kill strain, in a controlled lab setting!"".

DON'T USE BLEACH ON YOUR HANDS, though! For washing your hands, soap and hot water will make a bigger difference than alcohol and get rid of a wider variety of microbes- plus you actually get rid of things like dirt that won't be impacted by alcohols. 

edit: When I said ""something that needs to be disinfected"", I meant along the lines of things contaminated with raw sewage or blood, not typical household messes. As others have pointed out, healthy people do not need to disinfect most things in the house at all (though disinfecting your toilet bowl once in a while is probably a good idea). 
For food prep, the standard recommendations for food handling (like on the [FDA's website](https://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm255180.htm)) should be sufficient in most cases. You definitely don't need to bleach your dishes! 

From the research side of lab work: there are more research findings than you'd think published in influential journals that turn out to be wrong or only half true. These journals focus on impact, which sometimes means flashy papers with methods that only work for the people who published them, or papers from the right lab (i.e. famous professors) even if they're not necessarily up to snuff. And then when widely-covered papers get corrections or even retractions, popular media that covered the initial publication rarely release corrections to their articles. This is not to say that these journals only publish garbage- the majority of what they publish is scientifically sound, but they are generally going to pick a decently-done study with flashy impacts over a more rigorously-done study with a smaller impact. Be skeptical of reports about recent findings, and if they're something of interest to you, keep tabs on it past the initial publication to see how the field reacts. "

Out of nowhere, these two shirtless, sparkly angels pulled me away from him. These two sparkly, half naked guys put me in the middle of them and were dancing on/around me. It was incredibly fun and I was so grateful to them.

Shit's expensive. Use your money wisely. Don't buy a house in the floodplain.

ETA: If you're looking to buy a house, the locality probably has a Floodplain Administrator. Part of their role is helping residents with floodplain issues/concerns. Call them and ask if there's floodplain on the structure or on the parcel. If there structure of the home is in the floodplain, you will be required to have flood insurance to get a federally backed mortgage."

Not saying a woman should or shouldn't do it, but it's her choice and not dangerous enough for strangers to be justified in becoming the Pregnancy Police."

"My biggest two suggestions are to start using reusable bags at grocery stores instead of the normal thin plastic ones they offer and get a good, durable bottle (like the ones made by Nalgene) and use that for water each day instead of one time use water bottles.

There are other things, too. Like not using lids or straws on drinks from restaurants or using Tupperware containers instead of plastic baggies for food.

Basically anything made of plastic that is usually used only once and then discarded is going to be bad for the environment, so we need to find ways to reduce the demand for new plastic products by getting reusable options for our daily lives."

"I always think my guy friends are just unlucky in love or whatever, that their misfortunes in that department are just misfortunes, but once they start dating my other friends it becomes obvious that my guy friends just have gross personalities and I don't understand why they can't just be normal respectful people to their partners."
"My friend and I used to go out drinking sometimes. Usually I was the one watching out for her as she'd black out if she drank too much, so I'd help her get home, not do anything stupid, etc. Well this night I was pretty distraught over something and drowning my sorrows by getting shitfaced. I had never blacked out before, and this incident makes me think it's impossible for me to black out. I was truly shitfaced, but I don't get loud or stupid when drunk, I get quiet and kind of docile, like a sheep, so everybody drinking with us thought I was fine. But I wasn't really thinking anything at all.

There was this woman at the bar who knew my friend, and she was always a little handsy, but I've never minded that from women. So I think since I never said anything about her playing with my hair or squeezing my shoulders or whatever, she thought I was into her maybe, I just like being touched and am a bit gay.

So I'm drunk out of my mind, thinking inward thoughts, and my friend/the other people we were with were like ""Hey we're going to this lady's house! Come with us!"". I go along, as my friend is my ride and I don't just want to sit in the bar alone when I'm this drunk.

We get to her house, and her husband is there and is kinda agitated that his wife is this drunk and brought all these people over. I remember just sitting down and watching him play Soul Calibur for a bit, but eventually she specifically came and got me off the couch and was like ""I want to show you something, come on"" We go into her bedroom and she shows me... I don't know... a hat or something and I'm like ""cool."" 

Then she pushed me onto the bed, it was in a playful kinda way, and I just kinda limply flop down as it makes me dizzy. Then shit got non-playful. I am tall and strong, but I was too drunk to coordinate my actions, and this woman was short but bulky and not weak. Her friends then came into the room, same size and strength. And I'm like trying to speak and I just can't, I try to wriggle away and I can't. It's like sleep paralysis, I'm aware of everything, but unable to act. Her husband ended up coming in and his face shows he's not happy with this situation at all, but he doesn't stop it. Nobody stops it. Eventually we leave and I never see her again. I don't even know if she realizes she violated me.

In a practical sense I'm... relieved?... it wasn't the husband who raped me, but I'm also never going to get that drunk ever again."

"My 75-year-old dad. I really don't know what to do about it, any advice would be appreciated. My mom died 10 years ago, and he was so needy he started dating right away. My family introduced him to so many great people, but he only wanted someone *young*. 

Ended up going for a 30-something single mom. After a few years he realised he hated having her kid around the house, so they split. Now he still refuses to date anyone ""old"" (aka above 50) so he's all alone. 

He has no friends, because he thinks socialising like that is a ""woman thing"" (all his friends were couple friends he met through my mom). Has no hobbies. He guilt-trips my brother and I into visiting him, because all he does is watch TV. But he's always grumpy, and very sexist, and controlling, and I hate spending time with him. 

But he's my *dad*. I can't just leave him to waste away on his own. He's done some amazing stuff for me - he's just so fucked up, especially by toxic masculinity, which causes him to refuse any therapy/self-reflection, refuse a genuine relationship not based on sex, and refuse social activities. 

He's just resigned to being miserable and angry all the time. And because I'm the daughter, he expects me to take care of him (as opposed to my older brother), because apparently it's a female role. Arrrrrggh. "

"Medical Coder. A lot of room for growth if you get more certifications. You can work from home (20-30% do). You are mostly left alone. You do a lot of research about anatomy &amp; physiology (which I love). You need knowledge of medical terminologies and you need to be able to work as independently as possible. I love it because the research aspect is a lot of fun for me.

I make 54k/year right now while working as an outpatient coder in a hospital. I have a higher than average pay with one certification, less than a year experience in a hospital in west coast. I'm expecting a raise next year (58-63k/yr). The average pay rate is 17-22/hr.

Inpatient coders make about 60-70k+/year. Management positions *can* get you 100k/year but the average is 70-115k/yr. Of course, location, facility, experience and certifications are factored in as some places pay better than others. 

I'm thinking of getting a second certification then either a third cert or a master's degree in order to possibly pursue a director position. You don't really need a master's degree in order to get a manager position.

Edit # 2: Research into the pay rate at your state &amp; look at your local indeed or monster for job listings to see the demand in order to get a sense of whether it's a good career path for you.

Edit # 3: It's a low stress, moderately challenging job. It's not difficult once you're in the field. The only time I've ever been stressed at work was when the software we used to send over codes to billers went haywire. Everything else has been incredibly smooth-sailing. Then again I don't have a senior job yet so maybe that is more stressful.

Edit # 4: Please check more of the comments on this thread for more info since there is a lot of pros and cons to this job. It's an extremely oversaturated market."

This is how we get to solutions instead of bandaids. I feel then there's no secret resentment because you don't have a roster of unresolved situations marinating in your head. 

The thing is any show of emotion and all of a sudden you're being berated for being a ""crazy too emotional woman"" despite just sitting there wanting to talk. I am not OK with that being a normal thing in my life.

I think people find it hard to share so it's easier to devalue me than to be real yourself.  It sucks, but why do we carry what can be fixed if we put in work?  "

"You can also get recommendations from local EMTs or Paramedics (in California, firefighters are great people to ask) as they're typically the first ones on scene to any medical or trauma incident at a home and can tell you if they get called there often because of improper care.

But my heart hurts for all the times in middle school and high school I was so proud to have only male friends because ""girls are all drama."" When I hear other women say things like that it makes me so sad! Now that I am older, I treasure having good female friends so much and I feel so sad for women who don't have relationships like that.

"I was raped repeatedly by a childhood friends mother when I was 11. It took me a *long, long* time to admit that's what it was. Because it felt good, I denied that it was sexual abuse. It went on for about 3 and a half years before it clicked that I didn't want what was happening and that it was wrong. 

I've always known I was bisexual, but she severely ruined my ability to form romantic relationships with women. I've had a very difficult time trusting women since. I'm also not really that attracted to women my own age. Most of the women I've been with have been older, in the 35-45 age range. I do feel like she kind of warped my attraction to women and didn't let me get the chance to develop that on my own. Because of her, I've also developed certain kinks that likely stem from the abuse. I've moved past being ashamed of them, but I'm still pissed that I didn't get a chance to explore my sexuality on my own terms."

"I figured this out after my first inpatient when I was 20. My most recent stint was in June, when I voluntarily checked myself in for that exact reason. I needed to be kept safe while I came around.

"I think...probably ""[Cult of True Womanhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_Domesticity)"" kind of thinking is the closest to a distaff counterpart, but it does run pretty close.  The 'pedia describes the Four Virtues of ""True Womanhood"" thusly:

1. **Piety** – Religion was valued because—unlike intellectual pursuits—it did not take a woman away from her ""proper sphere,"" the home, and because it controlled women's longings.
2. **Purity** – Virginity, a woman's greatest treasure, must not be lost until her marriage night, and married women had to remain committed only to their husbands.
3. **Submission** – True women were required to be as submissive and obedient ""as little children"" because men were regarded as women's superiors ""by God's appointment"".
4. **Domesticity** – A woman's proper place was in the home and her role as a wife was to create a refuge for her husband and children. Cooking, needlework, making beds, and tending flowers were considered naturally feminine activities, whereas reading anything other than religious biographies was discouraged.

These may seem like small unimportant things, but they are part of the glue that builds relationships. Men end up much lonelier than women, on average, particularly if they are widowed / divorced and relied on their wife to maintain social relationships for them. 

They benefit from this emotional labour, but don't put in the work and aren't usually challenged on it.  "

"I was in graduate school at a party thrown by someone in my immediate course of study cohort with what I supposed to be a closed guest list. I brought a bestie of mine as my ""date"". She was another girl.

I don't drink much in the best of times because I'm someone for whom the loss of control that alcohol brings makes me very anxious and upset. This wasn't the best of times. I wasn't drinking alcohol at all.

So there I am drinking a can of Sprite from the can of Sprite ...

... that someone had apparently decided to drug.

Let me tell you how incredibly obvious it is that you've been drugged when you aren't buzzed or tipsy from alcohol: very.

So I told my bestie and the party hostess. Both quickly locked me away in the guest room and set themselves to guard me. The perpetrator - a neighbor of the hostess, and not on the guest list - came looking for me to see where I'd gone. My door guard got him retained and the cops called. I don't know which of the lovely ladies who were tending me was the one who did it, since I was on the other side of the door experiencing all the best effects that the date rape drug can offer.

"My favourite:  Tightlining along the upper water line - instant improvement.  Even if I do nothing else, tightlining and mascara are essential.

This isn't really a beauty tip, but I honestly think more women should embrace their natural hair colour when the grey starts to come in.  Few things are more aging, IMO, than 1/2 inch of grey roots, unless you count that unappetizing shade of baby caca that far too many women end up with.  Beyond that, exercise, eat well, don't smoke, and wear suncreen."

"When I was 19 I had a friend over to drink some wine and watch some movies. I got very drunk and I thought she was as well. I was wrong. 

I let her sleep in my bed with me because we were friends and I trusted her. But when she found out I was pansexual she took that as an invitation to ""experiment"" with me. I just laid there while she shoved her whole fist in my vagina. I tried evading her and gently pushing her away, but nothing worked. She wouldn't stop until I ""came"". Do you have any idea how hard it is to fake an orgasm to get a girl to stop fisting you when you're trying to hold in cries of pain?

As a result I have severe anxiety and trust issues. I'm on medication and have gone to counselling. I still dream about it sometimes and will wake up crying in my boyfriend's arms. I can't trust women in a sexual context anymore and it's quite upsetting.

I feel like I'm mostly over it. But the anniversary comes every year and all I want to do is curl up and not see anyone. If anyone is going through this please PLEASE get help. It makes it so much more manageable. PM me if you need a stranger to talk to.

"I didn't dislike my boyfriend when we first met, but I wasn't impressed either. We matched on Tinder while I was home a few weeks before and he drove 2 hours to meet me at college. My first thought when he entered the coffee shop was ""oh no. He's the type of guy that wears suspenders."" I was being super shallow and noticed that he had some grey hair already (at 22) and his teeth weren't perfect. Anyways, we spent the entire day together and had a pretty good time, but I wasn't all about him either. He made me laugh so I decided to give him a chance and see what happened. 

The first 6-8 months of our relationship I was completely indifferent about him. I liked him enough to keep seeing him (we were long distance but able to see one another every couple of weeks), but never really cared either. If we had broken up, I would've been sad for a while, but not devastated. These first months were pretty awful at times, too. I had never been in a relationship where the other person genuinely cared about me. It was terrifying. That paired with some emotional baggage made for me being a lousy partner. We came close to breaking up several times... but neither one of us could ever pull the trigger. 

One day it hit me that I could never find anyone better than him. He's a genuinely kind person. He cares about the world and the people in it. He doesn't manipulate people. He's just so fully good. He's the kind of person that would be a super hero if he had powers. I would trust this man to be faithful to me in a room full of naked super models. I realized that even with his flaws, he's better than anyone I could ever imagine. If I lost him now I don't know how I would recover. I think I would just implode. We've been together for two years, moved in together three months ago, adopted a puppy one month ago, and want to be engaged soon! 

TL;DR: I thought I was too good for my boyfriend. One day it hit me how far out of my league he is. He's one of the best human beings I've ever met. "

So, I worked tirelessly so that my work was always the gold standard wherever I was. I volunteered my time and energy cheerfully and without complaint to be seen as supportive and friendly in addition to being seen as an expert in my field. Honestly, it worked beautifully until I began having stress-related heart problems that I couldn't just ignore and push past. I 'retired' from a high level lead research position and have had to readjust my work preferences and learn moderation in my work. Now, I work as a research consultant very successfully which means that I can take on projects based on my time availability and stress levels without feeling the need to constantly push, but I keep finding myself slipping back into the old mindset and considering taking positions that would be detrimental to my health because the time/stress requirements. I wouldn't have ever been able to have the options available to me now if I hadn't pushed myself so hard in my career earlier, but I wonder if I might have had an easier time saying ""no"" and enforcing work boundaries to keep me healthier if I had not been in a constant quest to be taken seriously as a researcher because I was at an automatic disadvantage among my male colleagues as a woman."
"I'm allegedly a ""princess.""

This coming from the most princessy men themselves, who say this to me because I'm not going to be their fucking bangmaid."
I don't know how to feel about this
