"Finally my time to shine! I commute from bed stuy to Woodbridge, so just over the outer bridge. Previously lived in ridgewood and tried a million different options including public transportation. Finally figured out what I think is the optimum mix of time and cost. 

First, sign up for the frequent Staten Island visitor plan on the ez pass website. Brings your toll down to $6 going into Staten Island from Jersey, then there’s no toll going into Brooklyn. Takes me about an hour and a half to get home, most of which is in traffic on the BQE. That shouldn’t be as much of an issue for you in south Brooklyn. 

Getting out is a little trickier from south Brooklyn but doable. I take the Williamsburg bridge into manhattan then go over the holland tunnel to get into jersey for free. From there I take 78 over to the parkway which is free for the distance I’m on it. Takes me about an hour ten to get into the office. 

Total cost is $30 per week in tolls, plus about one tank of gas per week, plus wear and tear. Much better than the cost of the Verrazano going out or the NJT and better time wise than going around to another bridge. "
It won’t be terrible for you because you don’t have to get to work.
I believe the MTA actually made the decision to turn the alarms off a few years ago - basically tacitly accepting the practice. Which makes sense as the poster below says - it helps traffic flow to let people go out the gates.
"If you want the real deal experience:

* Be sure to stay in an outer borough hotel preferably on the G or the L.
* Book theater tickets for your trip now on stubhub. Premium seats. Money is no object.
* Go to google now and ask for transit directions. Note the estimated travel time between the theater and your hotel.
* The day of the show leave your hotel adding no more than 20 minutes to the travel time provided by google.
* Enjoy your authentic NYC subway experience.

"You said it yourself, it’s easier than waiting at a turnstile. The MTA stopped caring long ago (I’m not sure there was ever a time they did care?). The alarms don’t go off because they had been used to the point of no longer working &amp; the MTA never bother to fix them."
"I just think about which cardinal direction the train was moving toward when I got off of it. Then I keep track of my orientation as I make turns while exiting the station (which isn't really a conscious thing once you make a habit of it).

This won't work in far flung stations in the outer boroughs, but for everything in Manhattan, I know which way every station is oriented."
Sounds like a scammie cabby-- cabs from JFK are a flat rate of $52 plus tolls. 
"The closest chance you have of recreating this is to go to Alamo Drafthouse in Brooklyn where you will find yourself with two options.

They have fried pickles on their menu, but I know that isn't what you really want here, if you want a sour pickle then this is very much not going to satisfy that craving. So time to get a little creative. Before the movie, go downstairs to the Dekalb Market Food Court and head on over to Guss' Pickles and see if they have a sour pickle you like. Bring your new little buddy on up to the movie theater and have at it, you freak."
"It doesn't matter that they're trying to fix it, if there's no heat there's no heat. There is no try. 

You can call in a complaint to 311, or speak with an attorney about your options. NYC Bar Referral Service can connect you with a lawyer for a consultation for $35."
"Well one thing I can tell you is to beware of a good deal in the trendy neighborhood of Williamsburg Brooklyn - The L Train, a major line between Brooklyn and Manhattan is shutting down in 2019 and will cause massive issues. I had a friend move to Williamsburg and works near union square, because of a ""good deal and it was along the L, so a short commute"" and had no idea it was shutting down...Check out Yorkville for a solid studio around 2K."
"You hear ""stereotypical"" NY accents mostly from people who grew up outside of Manhattan and in white working class families. Almost inevitably whenever I walk by a group of MTA workers talking I hear someone with that accent."
"For platform crowding, the 4/5/6 in the uptown stations."
"Late night eating: Coppelia, Veselka, Cozy Soup &amp; Burger, Katz's, any number of other city diners

"
"First, make an important dinner reservation with people who you'll be meeting. The kind of fancy place that gives away your table if the whole party isn't present. Bonus points if it's someone's birthday!

You're gonna want to start far enough away that it sucks, but not so far you take a car. I recommend Utica Ave in Brooklyn. 

Obviously you'll try and take the A express train, and this is a mistake. Go with the C, the cars are older and the train runs local. Local is important: it's slower, and more likely to have a homeless guy throw up on your trip.

So you'll spend a good 15 minutes waiting for the C (around 60% reliability), and then transfer to the F (also 60% reliability) at Jay St / Metrotech. With any luck, the F will be delayed due to signal problems, but only once you're in the tunnel. This is important because you won't be able to catch a cab, nor will you be able to contact your friends and tell them you're running late. Fancy birthday dinner is still go!

Once it's completely impossible for you to arrive with a safe window of time, F train service will resume as normal. Congratulations, you've now lived through the worst.

Also you sat in something wet."
Liquor.
"If my neighbor gave me cookies I wouldn’t complain, if my neighbor never spoke to me ever I wouldn’t complain."
"It sounds terrible but also for $800 and my own bathroom AND a move coming up, I’d stick it out but ask them if they can tell you ahead of time so you aren’t affecting each other’s schedules or routines."
Uh... I just read the sign over the stairwell. [Like this one](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/b42f4e0f85e2430f9ae9311fd2036c84/subway-exit-sign-at-new-york-subway-station-2010-bxxjeh.jpg).
"NOSE. North Odd, South Even. On most streets in Manhattan (not avenues), odd numbers will be on the north side of the street."
"I am not familiar with NYC housing laws, so take my opinions with a grain of salt. However, between the fact that you're not on the lease, and you don't see management doing any favors, I think it's probably time to pack your things and move elsewhere.

Is there anything currently tying you to this apartment? What does the other subletter think? Would she be potentially interested in getting another place with you?

As long as you're under no obligation to move out, and you have the financial means to do so, perhaps start looking around now for a new place. I know it often gets a bad rep, but I found my current apartment on Craigslist. There are lots of people there who are looking to sublet a room, and you only have to pay security and the first month's rent. Be aware, there are also lots of realtors who are trying to rent apartments room by room (often to students). Stay away from those people. You can do better."
It is in my bedroom. HEY-O!
More like hitting bumper to bumper traffic 3 miles before the exit you’re getting off at.
Because it's closer to my stairwell than going through the turnstile. 
That bodega 2 blocks away from my/your/anyone's apartment. 
"Greenpoint:

* Peter Pan Donuts - best goddamn donuts in the city for the price
* Paulie Gee's - best pizza in North Brooklyn, as far as I'm concerned (sorry, Roberta's)
* Karczma - very good Polish food
* Ovenly - I'm not even big on sweets but I love the baked goods here
* Calexico - hipster Mexican food that I wanna hate but I can't
* Early - great little cafe with awesome sandwiches

Bars:

* Black Rabbit - great local bar
* Broken Land - nice cocktails, nice backyard that's great when the sun's out
* The Diamond - out of the way beer nerd bar

Other:

* WNYC Transmitter Park - great alternative to the Williamsburg waterfront, great views of Manhattan
* Good Room - awesome venue for parties, doesn't get the out-of-towner crowd that places like Output get
* Archestratus Books - cafe in the back, food-related books in the front"
"Go to South Brooklyn and Staten island,  the Italian American accent is alive and well over there"
"Thailand or Laos, probably."
"Sounds like you fell for one of the scam guys by the luggage area.  First time here I’m assuming.

Edit: Saw background, came from UK.  Ouch.  International terminal at JFK is full of those fake cab guys, your accent and EU clothing made you an easy mark sadly."
"There are lots of billiard spots, clubs, bars, dumpling spots, food spots in general, Korean skincare shopping, the gigantic library, movies at college point (you can take a walk there or bus), there might still be the arcade spot close to the movies (I think it was called smilies?), go to spacastle (if you go during work hours you'll have the entire place to yourself), busy bee if you want to do some strange shopping (cheap yet quality jewelry, cheap well done piercings), cheap beauty shopping at eve (you can get great hairdye here for 5$), botanical garden, go ski/snowboard(some shuttle busses start pick up in flushing), walk around kissena park, bus to Alley Pond Park for wildlife stuff and hikes, karaoke (most spots along Northern BLVD), try phenomenal pizza at Lucia, so many Korean BBQ joints along Northern (there's a 30$ flat fee all you can eat buffet one too), best Korean food spots are along Northern BLVD, there's a great gyro spot 3 miles from Flushing (it's called gyro I think. You'd get off close to wherever PS130 is), my favorite Korean sushi spot is called Nobu/Nolbu, there are also lots of Korean food spots there, if you're a photographer, Murray station is kind of cool to loiter around 

TL;DR-I grew up in flushing "
Jesus fucking Christ. Answer his fucking question or shut the fuck up.
"I recognize it's easier, but I do try to always exit using turnstyles. I remember reading somewhere they use the number of turnstyle exits to determine frequency of train service - so I want to make sure I count! I'm sure they factor in lots of people using the emergency exit though..."
Almost as ridiculous as me demanding a refund of my 15 seconds for reading this from you
Smith 9th has pretty good views of manhattan 
"The Cloisters in the snow is really something else. Botantical gardens, too. "
"I don't have an answer just a lot of sympathy. Accessing good mental health care in the city had never been a simple process for me, even with decent insurance. You either have to wait forever or pay out your ass and there seems to be no middle ground. I hope you're doing ok and get the care you need soon."
"It really boils down to:

Can you find a way to swing your housing on your budget?  This means roommates, rent-stabilization, not living in the trendy areas, whatever.

I feel like if you can do that you can live pretty comfortably on 42K, which is close to what I was doing for a while.

I figure it helps that I grew up in NYC.  I'm used to having to entertain myself while broke.  I know how to eat out for not that much (fuck, I love dumplings), I know how to drink for not that much (do it at a friend's place with decent cheap beer), I know that there's unlimited cheap/free ways to entertain myself every day of the year, and I know how to get around the city (And am willing to take the subway, at 2 am, while drunk, from Brooklyn to Queens).

If you want that life that some people think of what it's like to live in NYC, no I don't think you can do that for under 100K/yr.  But, that's just one option of living in NYC.  Those people spend more on cabs per month than I probably spend on food."
"Yes. About three years ago, the MTA announced the deactivation of all alarms. They encourage exiting through the door if you want to. People with strollers, tons of grocery bags, etc, use this door. When I have a cart, you just go to the attendant and tell them you're using the door. Go swipe your card and turn the turnstile by hand. Walk to the door with your cart or stroller and the door will unlock--in most stations with an attendant, the door swings open automatically. 

Exit doors are also useful for when a rush is coming in if you commute against traffic patterns."
You haven't seen BART or packed roads over there. I'd take a packed train over a car in a heavy traffic any time.
"There’s no way your studio should cost that much to heat even with the ductless system, you need to call con ed or take a look at your meter. I have a mini split system as well and unfortunately they’re useless when sub zero temps come around but I’m running 2 units pretty much 24 hours a day 3 days a week and 16 a day the remaining 4 and I’m barely brushing 250 and the stove is electric as well."
Sorry NYC movies theaters are BYOP
Not to be the wet blanket guy but any place that has sloths for photo ops/interactions is likely mistreating them. Sloths are shy and belong in the wild. If your gf loves sloths perhaps she can donate to a wildlife protection cause instead.  
"""Welcome! Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?"" Every guest. Every time."
"It's a bad idea to live next to a church. I do, and i have to listen to loud bells every hour, crazy bells and horns for weddings, squeaky bag pipes for funerals, screams, music, and drunken laughter during festivals. Wouldn't trade it for any other place in the city."
"House Of YES has some good parties for carrying tastes (funk, onsie parties, EDM, etc) and many are listed to go till 4 am but tend to go to 6. "
"The catch is commuting to NYC. The commute sucks. You may think its an easy commute, but it isn't. 

I lived about a mile away from Journal Sq which is a quick bus ride on the 10 bus that travels on JFK. My office is located in downtown Manhattan and my hours are 9to5. I have to catch the 7am if I want to get to work before 9am. 

Why so early?

Before 7am, the 10 bus arrives about every 10 mins, after 7am, about every half hour. On a good day, the 10 bus will arrive every 15 mins after 7am. Also, by the time the 730am bus arrives, the bus is so crowded that the driver will not stop. If the driver stops, then I have push my way into the bus. There are times where the bus isn't so crowded after 7am, and those are the days that school is on vacation. (Along JFK is St Peters U, Hudson county community college and Jersey City U).

Then, let's say you want to hang out after work, and have drinks with coworkers. If you do not want to have a long commute you leave at a decent hour where the Path train isn't running on night service where it first stops at Hoboken then JSQ. 

I drive, so if I am going to hang out after work, I will leave work early to get my car, so I do not have to deal with that commute home.

Last week I moved to a 2Br duplex apartment (for 1300 a month..wow!) closer to JSQ. I no longer have to deal with the 10 bus and can walk to JSQ. So life is good right now."
"For anyone not in the know, the MoS is really lame.  In other words: shrooms not optional."
I sound like fran drescher 
Why not both?
"You are allowed to do you music thing in your apartment within reason but being allowed to do something and annoying your neighbors is a whole different story. The amount of shit you'll get depends on the building, on the neighbor, the kind of music you play, the quality of the music, how long you play each time, and the volume. Some of those variables depend on you, some of those depend on other people. We know none of these variables since we are neither you nor the building.

So if you do decide to play at home as opposed to renting a space then be considerate, do as much basic everyday home soundproofing as you can - get a decent rug, have curtains, have furniture - things that can help absorb the sound so you aren't just playing in an empty room. If neighbors complain to you try to be cool and work something out, don't drop the ""well I have the right do make a normal amount of noise during daytime hours"" but maybe see if there is a time where neighbor x is always gone each day/week. Some residents are cool with it, some will hate you no matter what. Just please don't be the jerk musician that makes the rest of us look bad."
"Well, I started drinking whiskey again, I can’t say if it’s helping or not."
