"Do you have the address for his linkedin profile?  We're hiring...

"Oh, he'd be an excellent candidate! He's proficient in percussive maintenance, can talk for hours without ever making a commitment or really saying much of anything, and he'll eat green beans! "
"Friend of mine does tech support and had a kid a few years back. Takes son to doctor when he's a toddler for a check-up on his development. Dr shows kid some cards with letters and asks Liam if he knows what the letters are. 'P', 'W', 'D' shouts Liam with glee. ""That's great Liam, how do you know those letters?"" asks the Dr. ""P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D"" shouts Liam, ""that's what I put in my computer"". Dr looks at proud father ""He'll be just fine""."
"&gt; OK. I'll pass that suggestion along to RedHat

Perfection"
"On the other hand, removing the only non-emergency egress (assuming there is a fire escape - even worse if not!) from an area without confirming that no one is on the wrong side seems shoddy."
"&gt;me:You want me, personally, to staff three shifts of people seven days a week to monitor 500 ticket queues just in case you open a ticket after hours in the wrong queue?

&gt;user:yes, that is what I want.

""Ok, next time I need to email you, I'll send it to a random email address in the company. You'll be able to read it and act on it immediately, right?"""
"Reminds me of when a customer's secretary staff were placed in charge of cancelling redundant broadband lines into the building, because someone thought it was an ""admin"" job. 
&amp;nbsp;

Every line got cancelled. Fun times :D"
"&gt;If this is the wrong sub, please let me know.

We'll see.

&gt;I spent three shitty years working in a call center, two of which I was roped into acting as tech support

Yup, you're home."
"Once I could get.

But every ~~week~~day?

You need to screenshot this and show it to his people for he deserves shame."
"Friend worked for a massive IT wholesaler, multiple offices in different countries.
Move to new leased lines between offices.
Cancels redundant lines.
Week or so later, sites start dropping offline.
 
When checking up, found the spreadsheet with the lines, line to the office, line to be canceled to the office, repeated all the way down.
All fine. Gets copy sent to the telcos: Company logo has been added, moving the columns down one.
All new lines now marked for disconnection, all the old lines marked to be kept."
Unless of course his password is actually password. Then there is only weeping. 
"&gt;  the look I reserve for doorhandles catching my clothes

+1 for that turn of phrase right there."
"&gt; or change billing so that any call before 8 your time is 10x rate.

This definitely works. My company doesn't have 24h support but we watch our email just in case (it's finance, 24h isn't usually necessary) but we had a client who would call at all sorts of weird times and even on holidays. And then when someone didn't respond to him right away at 2AM or on Easter Sunday (two actual occurrences) he would go absolutely ballistic. To the point where he was getting our CEO involved. We tried to explain that we did not provide 24h support, but that didn't work. So when contract renewal time came around, we explicitly put a clause in the new contract for 9AM-9PM M-F support and 5x the rate outside of those times. The guy stopped calling at stupid times after their first new bill. "
"This is when you fire the client, or change billing so that any call before 8 your time is 10x rate."

"Wow, the kids really *will* be alright after all."
I alternated one spoonful of green beans with two spoonfuls of mango (his favorite thing ever) until he'd eventually eat them on their own. That's also how I got him to eat pureed turkey and sweet potatoes. Just pure bribery until his taste buds acclimated. 
So we have evidence that the tech support aura is inheritable.
"That's one entitled person!

I don't understand the part about her not studying at your university but paying tuition there because she gets it back easier."
"You got him to eat green beans! That’s the truly impressive thing I’m seeing. (As a fellow mom, my kid still has trouble with anything green that’s not totally unhealthy)"
"In OP's place I'd wish I had a friend in sales to provide him (CC to his boss) a quote for the 24/7 support he requested, first thing Monday morning. "
What is WRONG with people?
"Definitely escalate that one up the food chain.

Even if I had the skills to do IT, I don't think I'd last long.  I would either have no tongue from biting it too hard, or let loose on the user.

Have an up-vote, and maybe a drink. "
Well yeah but he was a toddler.  Presumably he'll update it to Monkey123 in a few years then move on to m0nk3y321 not long after that ...
Trying to recruit you into their cult.
Anyone who bothers a C-level employee because you didn't answer your phone when you weren't contractually obligated to deserves to be dropped as a client. Fuck that shit.
What an amazingly simple utter fuckup.
This should be the top comment. The site supervisor doing the work on the stairwell should have popped their head in to the room and verified they weren’t sealing someone in.
Or that basic troubleshooting is innate and users have lost the ability since childhood.
You'd think Chief **Financial** Officer would understand how money works.
"Cute kid story and following rule 1 of tech support?  This isn't just sub-worthy, this could go front page."
"""No matter how many times I ask, they won't make me a whopper at McDonald's"""
You'd think a business owner would understand the concept of money being exchanged for goods and services.
"I used to work for a nursing home that had several additional cable ISP connections for residents to use (each one fed a small network of 4 computers). For my last two years there, we'd get angry residents calling due to no Internet. The first few times, I spent a lot of time troubleshooting and getting techs out before they told us it was because the bill wasn't being paid. Found out the business office was doing it on purpose as a half-assed cost-savings measure... Some of the lines were 6+ months behind in payments. It finally stopped when I started directing residents to them to complain (it helped that the business office was a short power scoot away from the most heavily used resident network) "
"Well, in this user's case, probably nothing. He probably got there before the construction crew. OK, so yeah maybe he missed an email or even read it and it just slipped his groggy 7:00 AM mind that the stairs would be disappearing that day. Maybe the company should have posted something on the door the night before or something to remind people?"
"Pro tip - nonfunctioning network is often referred to as a nyetwork, from the Russian nyet or 'no'."
"Wat.

""I'm going to offer my services and those of my friend to this random techie that I'll likely never speak to again and who's probably not allowed to look customer phone numbers up except for work purposes, and tell them to call me.""

I just can't even."
This is not at all what I was expecting based off of the title.
"You: do the thing

Them: I didn't do the thing, why doesn't it work.

You: (dies inside a little more)"
"maybe its a tax thing? like she pays the tuition, puts it on her taxes so she reduces income tax, then gets a refund later since she hasn't enrolled in any classes. "
Why even bother opening a ticket? Just go outside and shout your problem into the wind. I'm sure the omniscient IT department this guy's imagining are monitoring that too.
OMG... I would MAKE a new friend with sales just to do this.
The user could have just returned from vacation and didn't have a chance to read his email until he booted up his computer.
Aww Thats almost as special as some who [glued rocks to their steering wheel](http://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1548104/85479126.jpg)
P is power which can lead to billing by the hour.
"They should have blocked off the doors the day before, when people were gone.

Or at the very least, sweep the floor before blocking it off."
"This particular client has a history of using one company for 3-5 years, finding something ""wrong"" with them, and then moving to another company. Which just means that every 3-5 years they're paying whatever extra implementation costs are charged by the new company on top of the monthly charges. So we milked them for everything we could while they used an application built on a 7 year old codebase, and I got a kick out of charging them for every millisecond of my time that they used. They just jumped our ship at the end of the year, and I'd love to be a fly on the wall of whatever new company they chose."
"Ah, the ""if it doesn't work, it's your fault"" routine. Refreshing. When did this happen?"
It's a trap
It's a special kind of thinking that only shifts one column to add the logo instead of adding another row across the entire sheet. 
Have you tried making a manual? Take pictures and circle the parts he has to click. Really dummy-proof it. Send it to him and CC his boss.
"Remember this time fondly. If my (almost 4-year-old) sister is any indication, soon he'll start insisting that he doesn't like green beans, mango, turkey, or sweet potatoes, he's never liked them, and he never will like them. Her favorite food (one of the few things she'd eat) used to be stew, to the point that my father made it and immediately froze it in ice cube trays; a couple years later, she insists that she's never had it and doesn't like it."
