Like I always tell that one friend if mine. You can go to school for the rest of your life and still die a dumbass.
She enabled [sticky keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_keys)!
"Much like the ol' ""I need you to recover this folder that I deleted last week"", only to spend *days* trying to recover the files from the *magnetic tape* back up of the daily back ups, pay two technicians overtime to get it done, deliver the missing files to the employee (who happens to be in upper-middle management) and have them reply: ""Thanks, I had completely forgotten about this! The only files in there were my [personal] files, and I just didn't want to go home and get them off my personal PC. But I got them, so we're all good now!"""
"""So yeah, if you were quadriplegic, you'd probably have the problem fixed by now already."" :)"
"There's not much more to tell, really. He plugged his microfilter into the test socket (the UK primary phone socket has an extension isolation socket under the faceplate) and the ADSL connected.

After that, he said  it'd take him a few minutes to get back in his chair and thanked me for helping him.

Some bitch and moan, others get on with it.

Edit: and then I stood up and loudly announced to my teammates ""I just had a quadriplegic guy go through troubleshooting!"""
"File your own HR ticket, telling them that user at  $PhoneNo has repeatedly tried to reach HR at your number."
We could reasonably eliminate at least one service desk agent where I am off everyone simply rebooted before calling in...
"&gt; Our network has issues with Android devices

How come? What's the issue?"
"&gt; Usually night vision and other not very interesting items.

Me and you need a discussion on ""not very interesting"""
"Developer here...

I am insulted. DO NOT call them developers."
"Clearly the process should be: 

1) File ticket with HR. 

2) After week of non-response, send email to HR manager advising of the failure to answer tickets. 

3) After nasty email from HR manager, escalate to HR manager's boss(VP of Bureaucratic Nonsense, let's say)

4) Repeat until somebody gets fired. 

(For maximum safety, only implement this protocol when you're intending to leave in the near future, because step #4 is frustratingly vague as to who is getting fired in this process)"
"Someone higher-up in HR decided to have HR's ticketing system filter any email from IT and junk it.

Our only way to talk to HR is to call them directly and they currently have a script their reps use when talking to someone from IT.  It's basically that IT needs to solve it on their own.  They'll listen, and use customer service skills, and the bottom line is for IT to take care of it.

I've since made friends with a few members of the HR department, and they understand it's stupid too.  However, their management has it in place, and enforces it.

I'll talk to some of them on our lunch or smoke breaks, and see if they can take care of it.  Since posting this up, 2 more calls from this same user have come in, basically asking if it's the HR department and then hanging up when he's told it's IT."
"“Hello county morgue! you stab em, we slab em! How can I help you today?” My personal favorite."
I love that image of a little hamster just frantically working away.
But... Why is it down? I am very important. I have a degree in *insert very complicated sounding thing*!
"&gt;**I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO** ~~TAKE SCREEN CAPTURES OF ALL THE STEPS AND THEN~~ **RE-DO THE CLAIM FOR ME!!**

This sums it up"
"&gt;'See, it's broken!'

Yes it is.

*takes out phone and starts filming*

Can you show me again, so we can avoid this issue in the future."
Don't click the upvote button? Okay. I clicked it. OP did you just die on the inside when you saw what happened?
"1. Denial: ""You didn't. Tell me you didn't do that.""
2. Acceptance: ""Oh my god. Why would you do that?!""
3. Anger: ""I TOLD you not to do exactly that! Do you understand what you've done?!""
4. Frustration: ""What do you mean there's nothing to talk about? They could have compromised our business!""
5. Resignation: ""Oh well, $Boss gets to deal with this from now on.""
6. Drinking: ""You know, I should write this up for TFTS."""
"It's funny - the more years you're in high school, the dumber people assume you are. But the more years you're in college, the smarter people assume you are. I knew a guy who went to college for 7 years, full time. He still didn't meet the requirements to get his Associates. "
Sounds like it's time for IT to filter all communications from HR and just send an auto reply that HR needs to take care of their problems on their own.
Would you be able to post the full quadriplegic story? I'm probably not the only one who wants to read it... :D
"We recently did mandatory security training which explicitly says if an email you aren’t expecting comes with an attachment you don’t recognise, do not open it.
Cue a week later, a suspicious email makes the rounds. Of all the people who competed the training, over 250 of them clicked the link.

You can never underestimate the stupidity of a user"
This is making MY eye twinge.
"&gt;Tech: I'm not sure why the cable came out, did you feel it snap into place when you put it in now?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: I don't remember. Anyway, I'm online now, so that's all that matters. Thank you.*click*

User will lose internet access again in 3..2.."
"This is close to ""I didn't have the proper papers so I stole them, surely they'll think highly of me now""."
I got extremely upset just by reading this lol. Please tell me there's a recording of the conversation(s) incase they tried to turn on you?
Yes! just yes
This guy is asking the right questions
Instructions unclear. Whole company is fired
Ive heard of clearly unsafe looking emails getting sent to everyone in the company with a link. When you click the link it signs that user up for the upcoming security training
"User: I need HR help. 
You: Certainly, what is your name and employee ID? Thank you, who is your immediate supervisor? Thank you. *click*

You: Hello, manager? Your employee, User, is on drugs or something. Can you make sure they're safe to drive home?"
"Lived with a PHD candidate who did eventually get his PHD... Kid legit did not know how to use a gas stove, how to load a dishwasher, use a plunger, iron clothing, understand why clothing came out the dryer wrinkled when left for a day, etc etc etc... basic normal adulating just escaped him for some reason. Every week it was an adventure in explaining normal day to day things. It was cute at first.. Then... not so much. The killer was after 3 years I needed to borrow a cotton swab, went into his bathroom and there was black mold everywhere.. and I mean EVERYWHERE... I brought it up and asked him when is the last time he cleaned his bathroom? Response?... ""I didn't know you needed to do that"" *blink blink* "
"&gt;Some bitch and moan, others get on with it.

It kind of shows something about how most people (myself included) tend to bitch and moan when things aren't at their worst, but will put on their big boy pants and handle business when everything is actually terrible.  I'd say for a quadraplegic who had to wait until Tuesday, he's already got the worst-case scenario when it comes to home network maintenance, so he couldn't see *any* solution but fixing it.

If only we could all, normally, think that way."
People at my work don't believe me when I tell them restarting fixes things. It's sometimes a fight with certain users.

"the whole thing was such a 'WAT' moment that I just stared at the thing. besides, I took the damaged cable and display back with me. it was pretty obvious the damage didn't happen accidentally."
"“Hello, Long John’s Sperm Bank! You squeeze ‘em, we freeze ‘em! How can I help you today?”"
"Okay, first: This sentence is gold:  
&gt; I open up the cabinet and start picking out the confetti. It takes a few minutes to realize that the confetti is advertising the exact model of tapes I'm using.  

Second, nice story. In the end I imagined you like Jackie Chan, battling the robot arm with your chopsticks, winning in a hilarious fashion."
"When you go to the field for the first time and actually get to use your nods (NVGs) you feel super cool for enough time to look through it and do a 360. Then you realize you're not spec war, so you can't see shit out of them even focused. You then begin to notice all the dead spots where you can't see shit from them being so beat. But you know, you push on. It's great until the first 5 minutes into a movement and you realize your neck is already getting sore from having this hunk of crap hanging off the front of your Kevlar. Once you enter the woods you then notice that you have no depth perception and really still can't see shit in front of you. Long story short, they get old to us super quick. Especially in a jungle where the canopy allows no light but leadership demands you still use them. "
YYYEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
This. All I could think of is “this is why we record calls”
"No, but I documented the call pretty thoroughly and our management has a “the customer is always an idiot” mentality when it comes to calls regarding insurance/claims. Instructions are posted online and each page has disclaimers like “the system will only send what info you put in; be sure of your procedure information, patient information, and insurance provider information at each step of the claims process.”"
Because no one else with a four-year degree has to do basic troubleshooting! 
"Omg my dad used to tell me that all the time! Course he’s used systems that are now dinosaurs, so maybe that’s where he got it from. He’s been a programmer since 1980."
"I didn't like your answer, so I kept asking the question, hoping it would change...."
"we have a product of ours that we also maintain. it has a web gui, graphical program for desktops and native app for mobiles.

customer has been informed well before that there will be backend maintenance. customer's employee calls.

- Them: '$PROGRAM just shows error screen'
- Me: 'We're aware of that, it's scheduled maintenance'
- Them: 'Okay, I guess i'll just use the browser'
- Me: 'That won't work either'
- Them: 'Hey, the mobile app isn't working!'

it's almost as if taking down the common backend somehow affected all fronts."
"I've found that the more specialized a person is in their field, the less they tend to be in touch with the real world outside that specialty."
"And it happened more than once, with more than one employee, which created additional meetings and reminders on the topic.

Also brings me to my point: When you pull crap like this on your support tech, you can't complain down the road when your tickets become low-priority via house rules. "
"&gt;I was trying to give myself and another user more administrative rights using the registry editor

Nope, nopenopenopenopenope"
"Yes, I've been told multiple times by users that this is not a fix and that it's a band-aid to the underlying problem; however, I can definitely attest to times where I have tried to fix a problem could not figure out why my fix was not working to only reboot and what I was trying to do suddenly work!"
I'm not even a developer and I feel insulted
"&gt;Someone higher-up in HR decided to have HR's ticketing system filter any email from IT and junk it.

Sounds like someone from IT needs to file a sexual harassment (or similar) complaint with HR. When it doesn't get acknowledged send an email to someone above HR asking who your lawyer should be contacting to follow up on the company's non-interest in ensuring a safe workplace for its employees since HR is clearly not interested in doing so. That should re-open your lines of communication to HR right quick."
To many steps detected. user shutting down. error lp0 on fire.
"Driver Smash!

Now Driver sad..."
"Reality has a way of taking the fun out all the stuff that seemed cool about the military.

Day 1 with rifle: ""This thing is fucking awesome! I feel like fucking Rambo!""

Day 2 with rifle: ""Why the fuck do I have to carry ten pounds of metal and fibreglass with me everywhere I go when no one is trying to kill me?"""
"i would kill for the chance to be a fly on the wall for that conversation

boss: *sigh* this meeting today is about the recent issues we've been having."
"IS = a member of our own InfoSec group:

&gt; IS: I need you to send me the password.

&gt; me: I don't see your S/MIME cert in the global directory, can you send it to me?

&gt; IS: I don't have an S/MIME cert. Just send it to me plaintext, I'll delete the email afterwards.

This is how you get a palm-shaped crack in your own skull.
"
"Sure, they may be right. But if the real problem is something like a memory leak in job critical software do they really want you fucking around in the code trying to fix it? Who gives a shit if rebooting once a week is a bandaid so long as it reliably fixes the issue. (Also, in general why the hell dont people turn their computers off at the end of the day? It would prevent so many issues if they were just rebooted once/day)"
"We worked on an embedded system in commercial vehicles too. Part of the system was GPS tracking of the vehicles. 

The management really wanted that. The union was opposed from day 1. 

Once we started installing, we began to receive reports that the units ""didn't work"". The avoid tempering, the hardware was in a locked enclosure, however there were still wires going into the enclosure through grommets. Apparently drivers, at the suggestion of Union heads, were simply ripping the wiring out of the grommets. Needless to say all connectors were simply destroyed.

Still needless to say, the drivers weren't that bright. The first unit we inspected had the whole day's worth of GPS data stored locally (driver pulled the wiring at the end of the day). Looking at the route data, the driver took a 90 minute ""detour"" off repeating loop-route... at a local coffee shop. This was exactly the reason why the management wanted that system in the first place"
