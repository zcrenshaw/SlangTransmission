"Type A is more competitive, assertive, organized, and ambitious while Type B are more relaxed. I don’t get it either cuz I’m def someone that likes to relax and not stress myself out, but I’m also competitive"
"A motorcycle. Sure it was fun for a while but then you realize how awful everyone drives. As a result my wanting to ride a motorcycle dwindled a bit until it completely tanked after a friend's roommate died in a motorcycle accident.

Sold my bike shortly after and never looked back. Didn't quite break even when selling it but glad to no longer have it.

**Edit** Thanks for all the replies and seeing other people's stance on whether it is worth owning a motorcycle or not. I think people should def make up their own mind at the end of the day but I will say that having the proper equipment is a must.

I live in South Florida, prob some of the worst drivers in the country reside here and I couldn't have imagined going out without a proper helmet, gloves, jacket and footwear. Just be safe and responsible. "
"Mix it up please. Sustained intense eye contact might be weird but def not weird enough to ruin a good beej.  Eye contact, back to work for a bit, then check in with eye contact again. Bonus points for a single raised eyebrow."
