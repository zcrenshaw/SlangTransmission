"""I was heavily bullied as a child and my family didn't love me, so with that in mind, here's my ass crack"" "

"This happened to me basically play\-by\-play with a bf once, except it was over me supposedly throwing his clothes on the floor.

What I‚Äôm hearing from your post is a few things that remind me of myself back then.

1. Your self\-esteem has been damaged in this relationship. You‚Äôre downplaying the seriousness of what just happened to you. Being hit by your husband is a profound betrayal and blow to your self\-worth, and can have lifelong effects and in the medium term you need to take care of yourself to build back your self esteem and prevent traumatic effects \(I‚Äôm thinking seeing a professional, working on assertiveness training too\). I had nightmares about this YEARS later.
2. You say you have no one to turn to, but are you sure none of those friends would step up? Sometimes when our self\-esteem has been beaten down, in a subtle, unconscious way we feel that we don‚Äôt deserve to be treated well by others, that others don‚Äôt care about us. Abusive people can isolate you. One of the lessons I found from my experience was that people DO care about me a lot more than I thought. Pick the friend you feel the closest to and TRUST him/her. At the very least you will discover whether they are a friend or not.

Good luck and hang in there, this is horrible but long\-term you‚Äôre going to be OK if you fight for yourself.

Also: don‚Äôt go back. Being beaten up by a bigger stronger guy can KILL you. Kicking can rupture an internal organ. Our bodies are FRAGILE.  It‚Äôs not like in the movies where somebody gets beaten and is OK after. I have back problems and permanent nerve damage that may be related to my experience. You may not know the physical effects for a long time. If I could go back and talk to myself back then I would say: don‚Äôt underestimate the physical effects."
"You were just brutally assaulted in your own home, call your friends and the police! What kind of friends do you have that would be annoyed that you needed their help/company after something like that?! Those are SHIT friends. 

Best of luck getting out of all those toxic relationships, if it were me I'd up and leave all of it and/or cut them off entirely.

Edit: per u/smoothfeatrobthomas comment, your friends are very likely to support and protect you and help you get out of such an abusive relationship. I'm sure they'd be perfectly willing to house you until your lease ends. These types of situations are why friendships  are so important and even if you havent talked to one of them in years they're still likely to be happy to help you out however they can. Please reach out to them!"
Hate fuck him. 
BUT I'M IN LOVE WITH MY BEST FRIEND
ONE TIME HE SNEEZED NEAR ME SO DO YOU THINK HE MIGHT BE GAY FOR ME??? 
"I didn't realize people in this subreddit were so delusional.

No, straight men do not want you. Stop being a fucking creep and leave them alone. Perving on straight men is why people still harbor negative attitudes towards LGBT people. Stop enforcing negative stereotypes and grow the fuck up. "
"Do it, maybe something interesting could happen "
I'm sure it will continue long past 2018. It it getting more tolerant but I doubt there will be 100% tolerance in my lifetime.
"Where are you located? You really need to get some support. I for one have zero tolerance for hitting. Being abused as a kid and even as an adult, I know where it leads. Some guys here will say ""go talk it out..."" and such. But no, you don't hit the people you love, period. PM me, and let me see if I can help you find resources around where you are. "
I grew up in the slums of a homophobic country. Tonight I bottomed for the first time and fully accepted myself as gay. \*Insert picture of a prolapsed bussy*
Fuck him. I mean literally fuck him.
"My boyfriend and I pulled up to a red light and in the car infront of us a straight couple were kissing. We loudly said, ""gross""... It was a beautiful sunny day. Their windows were open, our windows were open, our sunroof was open. They heard us and turned, looking a bit hurt and offended. We were just joking. 

Well, they were looking at us, so we kissed each other. The couple cheered for us. We were quite chuffed. And I think they then understood we were just joking. 

Only time we've ever gotten applause from strangers for kissing! A favorite memory. Much better than the times we've been called fags! "
Do black people have black cum.........I‚Äôm not even black. 
"He might be asexual? 

I think you shouldn‚Äôt marry him if you know it will not end well. "
‚ÄúDoes anyone hate pussy/boipussy/bussy or is it just me?‚Äù is my favorite weekly thread. 
"I‚Äôm so freaking happy for you!! I came out to my immediate family about a year ago, but I came out to my all of my family today as well.

You‚Äôre brother seems like a sweet guy, cherish him because not all of us are so luck to have such a great brother. I know I wasn‚Äôt(He totally accepts that I‚Äôm gay but we‚Äôve never been close and I‚Äôm fine with that).

Please enjoy the day and yay or as we say yesss queen! lol"
Anyone else click on this post in case there was a picture of someone in a jockstrap?
"It doesn‚Äôt matters whether he‚Äôs gay or not, if your sex life doesn‚Äôt fit, don‚Äôt marry him. "
"I get what you‚Äôre saying but pro tip: abused people are usually cut off from their friends and family by their abuser, either by being convinced that their friends don‚Äôt care about them or pressured to stop spending time with them

If OP feels like he‚Äôs lost friends being in this marriage it‚Äôs probably not his friends‚Äô fault (if they even see it that way) and abuse victims should be encouraged to strengthen connections to friends and family, not further isolate themselves and cut them off "
Gay guys more often than not don't want you either. Just assume no one wants you unless they explicitly say they do.

"If they persist, offer a personal demonstration."
"In 2016 I came out to all my close friends, and in late 2017 I came out to my fundamentalist Christian family, so this is my first fully out Pride Month! Thanks for a wonderful sub and a great group of people! "
"Wondering the same . I‚Äôm 24, live in a gayborhood actually . And it just seems people either want to have sex with me , be in a relationship with , or don‚Äôt care for me at all . I have 1 close gay friend . "
"I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier."
"Whenever I see someone commenting about pride parades as though it is just a bunch of mostly naked guys and fetish gear, I know that they have never actually seen a pride parade.  While there will of course be some of that, for the most part, it is just average people walking together wearing matching t\-shirts representing their company, church, politician, or activist group. It's actually kind of boring."
I am 100&amp;#37; gay so I assume there are a lot of 100&amp;#37; straight guys out there as well.
"I live with three straight dudes and they ask me funny questions all the time, like what's it like sucking dick, how are you not grossed out by it, how do you put a dick in your ass (I rarely bottom). It's all kind of amusing to me lol"
"Those ""perfect"" guys only show the positives, but offline, they are just as imperfect, anxious, jealous, insecure and depressive as the rest of us.

Social media tends to make people only show the positive aspects of their lives, which is why they seem perfect, but if they showed everyone their whole selves, they would probably be much less appealing"
DO STRAIGHT PEOPLE SMILE AT GAY PEOPLE?
"I AM CLOSETED. THERE IS A CHANCE HE IS TOO, RIGHT?"

"You can still give him grandchildren. Do not place such a heavy burden on yourself. Be honest with him whenever you are ready. 

To be honest, it wasn't fair for him to put you in that position. You are entitled to come out when you feel safe to do so. The good news is that you will be supported when you are ready. "
An ‚Äúunbelievable ‚Äú guy wouldn‚Äôt hit you. Call the cops and divorce his ass. 
how about we start calling it a mancave?
"Well - you tried. 
If she chooses to be in denial or think that it‚Äôs a psychological issue (e.g. trauma) then I doubt there‚Äôs much you can do. 
Maybe she could read and see for herself how homosexuality works, how it‚Äôs innate and how you can‚Äôt change it. 
If she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdisown‚Äù you or kick you out of the house or not talk to you again - I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that much of an issue. Time will make her more comfortable with you being gay, she won‚Äôt always believe it‚Äôs a phase and you need therapy. 

Don‚Äôt come out to her again, just keep being yourself. "
or maybe we can just stop that terminology altogether

"HOLY COW! 

What a crazy lady, indeed. She needs to be involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. Your brother needs to talk some SENSE into her. All of that religious BULLSHIT has rotted her brain."
"One time my brother asked me if I get married, would one of us wear a dress"
"The amount of ""I can't stop staring at guys in the locker rooms""  or ""I can't stop ogling this guy's ass"" posts on this subreddit is pretty depressing. Like, yes you can stop staring.  It's called having some basic self-control and not being a complete creep. "

"When I was a kid, one of my buddies moved into this really nice beach house that had been owned by an affluent gay couple before. Their shower had over forty shower heads with various attachments at various heights. If you turned them all on at once the floor drains couldn't keep up. I was like ten so I didn't think of this at the time, but their were 5 bedrooms in that house, and one couple lived there, as well as having a completely enclosed courtyard with an oasis style pool. There were some CRAZY orgies there, I'm sure lol"
"Sweetie, that's terrible. CALL ANY FRIEND. Let them know you were just assaulted. Just press that button and reach out to ANYONE nearby. Please don't go back home. Please wait to talk to him until you have a trusted person by your side. Stay safe. üíì"
"Hooks up with a guy... Hooks up with another one (different times). .. Meets first guy again; he introduces his husband. Husband is the 2nd guy. Meets 3rd guy in the following week. He says he's waiting for his friends. Friends turn out to be the couple. Get naked with all three of them. 

This is the story of how I ended up having a foursome. "
"I cant stop staring sometimes if the the guy has a nice ass. But sometimes I worry that the guy might catch me staring, so I try to be as discreet as possible. "

"No offence taken.

I don't peruse it regularly, but I keep it, and subreddits for other groups that I'm not part of, or actively disagree with, where I can see them. It's good to be exposed to people who think differently then I do.

I don't know shit about what it's like to be gay. But if I glance through here once in a while, I maybe get a shadow of an idea, so I can better treat gay people how they want to be treated.

I responded to this post because this is the second post I've seen in as many days about how terrible it is for gay guys to be lusting after straight guys. I don't think there's anything wrong with it, as long as you understand reality. I mean, I find lesbians hot, I just know they aren't ever gonna be interested in me, so I just enjoy the view, and get on with my life.

Hell, that last applies to Lucy Pinder, too, and as far as I know, she's straight."

Asexual people can and sometimes do have sex you know
"You haven't failed, he doesn't care, if he does care he'll get over it, he loves you, he wants you to be happy, and it'll help build your relationship with him if you go tell him the truth and your reasons for lying.

didn't even have to hook up with them. This one guy added me on instagram and over the year became good friends. Hit me up with free Disneyworld tickets "
"Just to put this out there. I might get a ton of hate for it, you dont owe anyone an explanation or have to be out to anyone. You as in a general sense. 
On a lighter note im so happy for you! Most of us are not as lucky. There is hope indeed, hoping more people find the courage if they so choose to come out. "
"No, he obviously wants the full ass"
"Haha I will message him. I always thought he was hot back in high school and I've really glowed up since then. But he's aged a bit, but still looks pretty good. "
"Lol y‚Äôall so stupid for buying this. This is a troll with so many alt accounts . Zak1992, colony95, markus. He posts nothing but this again and again. "
I would imagine that people see you as supporting and voting for candidates who work against LGBT civil rights.  
What a boner killer
Handled it just fine imo
"Funny that gays are coming out of the woodworks to ""prove"" you wrong.  Just more hypocracy and double standards the community has.

Apparently, if you are gay and into dudes it is totally not a choice, completely involuntary, and it is wrong to persecute or try to shame gay men into having sex with women (or suggesting they could in the right circumstances).

But if you are straight, well then you must just deep down repress your homophobic feelings because only a guy who identifies as straight would actually be repressing his same sex desires!  It totally makes sense, I learned about it in a psych 101 class before I switched to gender studies!

Seriously, don't bother.  Let these gays have their delusions that straight men are getting rock hard solid and fucking them in the ass.  No amount of bitching is going to get through to them."

"I had five different men on the same day, but three of them were at once so it only counts as three different incidents."

"When I came out in high school, my one friend was like ""wow!"". Knowing my goal was to study psychology after graduation, she said ""what are you going to do now?"" I asked ""what do you mean?"" And she asks ""are you going to be a hairdresser now? Or an interior designer?"""
"Hi!

And Welcome ""Out!"" :)

And don't worry--these posts need to be made a million times more!

Good luck! :)"
"I was walking down a busy boardwalk at a popular local beach a couple of years ago with my boyfriend - not even holding hands or anything though we both were dressed fairly nicer than most people so I suppose might have ""looked gay"" (whatever that means to a homophobe). This big meathead of a guy literally knocked me back into my boyfriend with his shoulder and said: ""watch out faggots."" 

He was all laughs about it, but the two buddies he had with him were pretty annoyed. One of them asked: ""Dude, what the fuck?"" and made sure I was okay, which was appreciated. The worst part about it was that it happened on my birthday. 

Every time I think society takes a step forward something happens that reminds me not everyone is okay with who I am. "
"You're posting this here because we're family. Your post belongs here.

So, Congratulations! :)

One: for coming-out to your brother.

Two: for having such a good brother to come-out to. 

I hope the rest of your summer goes as smoothly. :)"
Been fucked by thirteen guys in a day

"This is not something that all straight friends do, only incredibly shitty friends that you need to get away from ASAP. My friends if anything were trying too hard to encourage me to go to a gay club when I hadn't had sex, it was a little silly but I appreciated the effort.

It's one thing to not want to go to a gay club, that is odd but I suppose understandable, but it's another for them to say they all will ON YOUR BIRTHDAY and then make excuses ON THE DAY. Really, even if you have no other friends at the moment, get rid of them. The most common way people stay with their toxic friends is thinking they won't find anyone else, when you really can with time, luck and effort. "

"Oh my god. This is a case of intrafamily violence. friend, you must report it to the authorities. Today he hit you, tomorrow he can do something worse. I know that you love him, I know that you have spent five years together, but people change and sometimes they do it badly. The first thing you should worry about is your health and your life. Go away, leave him, because tomorrow may be too late.

Sincerely, someone who lost a family member because of intrafamily violence."
Workout shorts for me
"Dealt with this crap my whole life. my preferred response is ""And Jesus says 'Judge not, lest ye be judged', motherfucker, so back the fuck off or go to Hell.""

They never expect you to quote scripture back at them, and the type that does this crap doesn't know their scripture well enough to deal with it.

By the way, point out to them that there's a gay couple blessed by God in the old testament: Read the story of David and Jonathan sometime. 

Second Samuel chapter 1 verse 25\-26: 

"" Jonathan lies slain upon your high places.  
**26**¬† I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;  
*greatly beloved were you to me*;  
 **your love to me was wonderful,**  
 **passing the love of women. ""**

Also, always remember, no matter how icky, that the worst homophobes are the self\-haters that are tempted to be gay themselves.

Almost all of the ""anti\-gay"" passages are about temple prostitution.

Sodom's sin was not sodomy, but being inhospitable, the men of the town broke the customs respecting a man's guests in his home.

If the bible quotations don't shut them up, threaten to kiss them, they usually run away at that point.

So sorry you had to deal with this now, but am thrilled to hear this is the first time you've ever had to.

This old gay man is very happy you stood up for your friend, and so sorry that you ever had to.

Luckily, these ""greasy old farts"" will die off eventually, and take their hatred with them.

Their children tend to be much more open, and more focused on god's love than trying to justify their own hatreds.

Big internet hug for ya babe."

You just paraphrased every single one of those posts. 
Why things like that never happen to me.
Then we‚Äôd really share DNA 
"I‚Äôm gay, but I think koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

"I don't recommend it. I have lots of friends and a brother (also gay) who have done porn. 

Even if they take you on, you're likely not going to be able to make a successful career out of it and you're not going to make a lot of money. 

You'll maybe make a few thousand dollars, get flights and hotels to wherever they're filming and that's about it. 

The porn industry is full of drugs and terrible people. All your going to end up with is a possible drug addiction and bunch of cheesy gay pornos that will haunt you for the rest of your life. "

"Nothing.

Doesn't have to mean anything outside of that moment.

If those moments end up including some gay play then let it be."
Yes
My response is that I'm fine with them not needing it.  I need Pride.  If they don't like it they can stay at home.

"The bigger issue here is how your parents are trying to micromanage your life. That level of spying is insane. You're an adult but only 18, if you can afford to get your own phone and service do so. I anticipate you needing to set firm boundaries with your parents at some point in the future for your own happiness."
THANK YOU!!! Someone with common sense!!! Good advice! 
Lmao as a black man I can confirm it is a common question 
"I think that the golden rule of coming out is that you should be able to live on your own, just in case things go shit.

Now that things have gone shit it's just that you have to play a perfect son for a while and then GTFO. Or option two: don't listen to them and be 100% rebelious teenager stuff.

If parents don't accept you, they never will. Get used to it and stop making a big deal out of it. If they happen to understand that they do wrong, then hurray, otherwise you'll be disappointed your whole life.

I tried to have a good relation with my parents and it exhausted me emotionally. Now I understand that this is not my damn problem."

I went through a similar situation as OP and I don‚Äôt think he came out to his parents because he owes them anything. If he‚Äôs anything like me, he came out because he deserves to be able to be true and honest with himself and that starts by breaking down the fake walls with some of the most influential people in your life.

"Went to a gay bar with a few coworkers, including one young kid who was from a small town and had lived a super sheltered life. Somehow, I ended up being the one stuck with babysitting him when he got wasted and was trying to give his virginity to every guy in the place.

At the end of the night he's insistent that he wants to go home with these two guys, so I tag along to make sure he doesn't get taken advantage of. Sure enough, as soon as we get to their place he passes out on the couch. I was totally fed up with the situation but started talking and drinking with the guys, and eventually ended up naked on a couch opposite from the one my coworker was passed out on, and got fucked by both of the guys. Somewhere around 5 am I took a shower, woke my coworker up enough to pour him into a cab, and went home feeling satisfied and dirty at the same time.

The funny thing is one of the guys got my coworkers number and they ended up fucking him a few weeks later, which only made me feel sluttier."

"In grad school I made a wonderful little gay gang just by meeting the other guys in my classes, doing group projects together, going to the school‚Äôs gay events, etc. We also were a united front against this other gay guy who was a super creepster who basically molested everyone. 

When I moved to a big city, I was randomly at a bar alone, and wandering through the dance floor, and this cute guy pounced on me, and we danced and made out for an hour. At closing time, he introduced me to all his friends who were also there. Nothing more happened between me and that guy, but his gang quickly became my gang (for better or for worse).

Then I moved to another big city, and I‚Äôve had a bit less of a gay gang because I‚Äôve been working too much and I‚Äôve been in a relationship. But I still have a bit of a gang, meeting friends though my fellow grad school classmates who are in the same city, and meeting friends through my neighbors who are a cute and sociable couple. 

Moral of the story: make a friend, have them bring you to stuff, and you will make more friends. "

"I disagree. Moonlight feels way less relatable for most people.  It's not their reality, it's the reality of gay people who also belong to marginalised ethnic minorities that are affected by other issues like poverty, crime, drugs, more conservatism, etc. In developed countries most people are white and middle class and won't face those problems. Young white middle to higher class gay men feel more attached to Love, Simon, even if it doesn't stop being an idealization, because their problems don't usually go beyond studying, having a crush on a cute guy and coming out in what in many cases is an already accepting social circle. Besids, Love, Simon, is a mainstream movie that catters a young mainstream audience, because even if the character is gay, many of his issues are similar to those of most teenagers."

"Not OP but I am 41 this year. The change has been just amazing for me living in the southern part of the US. There will always be someone who thinks they are better than others, someone who thinks they get to judge others, and someone who thinks they should attack others to feel better. That is the nature of people, if not for being gay then for the color of their hair, where they live, skin color, accent, how they dress, or their income. Its just human nature.

I don't want to tell you your problem is ridiculous or anything, but the way you are looking at it certainly is. Your coming out isn't supposed to be a big event like your quinceanera or some shit, is just you letting people know you are gay. If your parents already know then whatever, its even easier for you. The only real problem here is the spyware in your phone, get that out of your phone yourself or get someone to get it out.

You have a really fucking great life and are worrying about literally nothing."
It all still works but you're generally not sexually attracted to people. I have an annoyingly cute friend like this. 
You need to focus on yourself and in all honesty you coming out will make it easier for him. You will in a way pave the road for him. But this is about you not him.

"Straight is only a turn on until you manage to get one in bed and realize how fucking horrible sex is with a guy that just wants to fuck sloppy wide open vagina, not bottom, and just be girly about it the whole time. ""oh babe we're gonna have fun"" is how it starts, and it ends with ""I'm so sorry I couldn't get hard"".

And if they are hard because of Viagra, it's still bad because straight guys are more likely to be hung up in all the straight masculine culture stuff.

Yes, it's a wonderful fantasy until you actually get to experience it, and both sides come out agreeing that man is straight. Firstly he doesn't want a man, and secondly, evenil if he did, the way straight sex goes now-a-days is a gross cognitive dissonance between ""who's dominant"" and ""giving up dominance"".

I guess it's because ... My personal experience, but we all talk to straight guys about their sex. You know."
"stop talking about your feelings with your family, and avoid conversations about relationships and future, put all your energy and mind into two things only, those two things will be the following:

2. Gym: keeping your time busy in the gym will take time away from your family, and you will reap the benefits in a very short period of time, this will help you in the future as well.

so there you go. two things, and keep doing those things over and over, and eventually enough time will have passed that you will be able to get out and get a good bf, do not for any reason get one right now, you are very vulnerable and do not have the experience nor the money to get out of your house.

"I think because people who have sought out a fair place in the world don't understand when one of our own doesn't want to help people. The way I see it people who consider themselves fiscal conservatives are against social programs that help people that are down on their luck or have come from disadvantaged circumstances. I come from a very affluent family. My parents sent me to very good private schools and paid for everything all through college. I'm white, I'm tall, I'm attractive looking, and I live in the US. I'm even the easy kind of gay that I'd have to tell you I'm gay for you to even know. Lots of people need help. If my taxes have to be a little higher so the least of us has a warm place to sleep and a meal to eat then so be it. When kids go hungry and don't know when the next time they'll eat is it's unacceptable. Fiscal conservative draws wrath from people who don't understand why you don't feel the need to help people. "
