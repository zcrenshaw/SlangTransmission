"my heart def stopped, it was in slow motion..."
"Years ago, I was visiting my grandparents in the Ozarks. They have a really nice house, but some of their neighbors can be questionable...and by that, I mean white trash. I overheard a girl about my age (we were probably 17 then) shout to someone from a few houses down, in a southern accent:
""Mah baby does NOT look like an orangutang!"" 

Uh, miss, I've seen your baby, and no, it def does look like an orangutan. Whomever made that assessment is spot-on. "
