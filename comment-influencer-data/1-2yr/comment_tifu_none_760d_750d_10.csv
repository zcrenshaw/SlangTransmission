All's well then. Best to bury the memory. "
"No OP, no!

##**GET AHOLD OF YOUR FUCKING SELF!!**##

Listen to me now you silly bastard!  

Repeat after me, ""My email was hacked.""

Okay, here is what you do.  You put on your best poker face, you acknowledge nothing.  Tomorrow is just another work day.  Nothing new.  You had a boring weekend, you ate toasted cheese for lunch because you were lazy as fuck.  

Wait until someone approaches you, and someone will approach you, before saying anything.  Hopefully, they lead with ""What the hell is this email about"" or something along those lines.  When they do ask, you act mildly surprised.  NOT INCREDIBLY SURPRISED! NOT UNINTERESTED! Just normally surprised in the sense of ""hunh, what email?""

There are plenty of malwares out there that will phish for more emails by affecting one email and sending emails out to everyone in that first person's address book; there will be an attachment too.  

For fucks sake DO NOT carry this burden with you for the rest of your life.  LIE!! LIE FOREVER!!!  As soon as you ""find out"" that people have received the email go straight to IT and tell them that you think your account was hacked.  Pretend to know nothing about computers.  IT won't take any fucking chances.  They'll probably scan it for viruses, not find anything and then quarantine it anyway incase it is a 'day of event' meaning a new hack that has not yet been patched for.  After that tell HR.

Do you really want to have to uninvite any of these people from your wedding!?

...omg...wait...

No...

OP... no... tell me you didn't use your name or the name of people close to you in this fan fiction or used any other information that would out you as the author... are you the author?  No, no, that doesn't matter now.

OP PLZ!!!

"When I was in high school my parents had a hot tub, and one night I had a friend over and we were in the hot tub (apparently) loudly talking about masturbating. I went into lengthy detail about how remarkable it was to use the pull-down shower head for such purposes. The conversation was going fine and well until out of nowhere my dad walks up and says ""you two should really talk about that somewhere else."" I was mortified. We hadn't heard him open the back door over the hot tub bubbling or seen him come outside (he came out to smoke a cig) and apparently we were talking quite loudly. I told my mom about it and she thought it was funny. Most awkward dad encounter hands down. 

EDIT: Wow! So many comments. 1st I'd like to say we were absolutely taking a risk by having that conversation outside of my bedroom. My dad was visibly weirded out when he confronted us, and yes, since he was a smoker we should've had the common sense to know he or my mom might have walked outside (but hey, teenagers, right?) and that they had every right to be out there. For a little more context the hot tub was around a corner from the actual porch and sitting area, so I'm sure he just came outside, sat down, overheard a bit of the conversation, then put out his cig and basically said to take that inside since we weren't exactly being quiet. Mom laughed it off and told me not to be embarrassed and assured me that my dad would eventually block out that memory. 

Also, in case anyone out there needs a lesson on female anatomy and pleasure.... you don't stick the shower head inside your vagina. It's all about the water flow. Someone mentioned that using a shower head was gross because it's communal, so I thought that might need clearing up....  "

Seriously. If this guy can use his turn signal while literally dying then there is no excuse for anyone else.
It bothered me that you were having a medical issue and the girl thought it was okay to get dressed and leave.  I get that she was freaked out but instead of basic concern she abandoned you.  Maybe she didn't need to call an ambulance but it would have been understandable if she did.  Other acceptable options would have been to try and turn you over or at least make sure your airways were clear and attempting to clean up the mess in case someone needed to be called to care for you.

Yea, people will talk and some of them may joke about it behind your back while making air quotes when saying ""her 'email' got hacked"" before bursting out laughing, but most of them will believe you depending on your reaction.

The obviousness of the lie is why it will be believed.  I mean, who would make up such a blatant lie?  Then again, what woman would be sending around pornographic chapters of Harry Potter at 26?  I don't mean that as an insult either, I'm just saying that as an outside observer it seems more likely to me that all of this happened because of malware that queued a very prevalent phishing technique.

"Blood in your stool will turn black. If it's red, that means it is fresh and is probably from a wound near your anus which is unpleasant, but rarely a serious health concern (anal fissure or hemorrhoids). Black stool indicates internal bleeding. Op probably got a tear in his esophagus while choking, which isn't unusual for that situation. Those can bleed a lot so his stomach sent some blood into his bowels (basically digesting it) and continued to fill up. Your body will reject a stomach full of blood, so he puked.

"Ive visited the universe where you ignore your girlfriend.

She gets upset with you for a while, but mostly gets over it eventually. When the Bitcoin value doubles, you decide to sell off half of it to recoup your investment. The rest sits on your hard drive for a while.


The real trouble begins a few years down the line, when the value of Bitcoin begins to rapidly inflate. It seems like your stubbornness paid off after all! But the butterfly effect of your decision has already compounded in many unseen ways. 


For one reason or another, your (now) wife's father falls gravely ill. The prognosis is hopeful, but the operation and subsequent treatment will cost orders of magnitude more than what he can afford. As the only remaining family her father has left, a profound sense of obligation rests on your shoulders.


The nest egg you've built can just cover the cost of the operation, and with some domestic compromises, your household income will probably suffice to pay for the treatment as well. But herein lies a dilemma;


You can see where this is going. The price of Bitcoin is still increasing! And swiftly so! Even one additional week's worth of inflation would yield a hefty profit. You could pay for your father-in-law's operation and then some! With that money you could have that dent in your car fixed! Replace the dingey carpet in the dining room! Buy your wife that expensive anniversary gift she deserves. Take a much needed vacation! What a windfall this could turn out to be! It seems most prudent to make full advantage of this opportunity.


And so you wait. Your wife begs you relent, but what does a few extra days matter? His condition doesn't seem life threatening just yet. You've calculated that each passing hour of idleness yields dividends equal to a small treat. And it doesnt take many small treats to add up to one big treat.


What started as a few days turns into a week and a half. With tears streaming down your beautiful wife's face, you begrudgingly decide its time to cash in. The operation is scheduled for later that very evening. 


Luckily, all goes well despite the obstruction. With her father in recovery, and you skipping home from the bank, it sounds like the end of a fairy tail. But there is trouble in paradise yet.


Your wife had gotten over the purchase of the Bitcoins *mostly*. But now for the second time, you put something at risk, despite her wishes. The first time it mattered less. But the second time you risked something very dear to her, and for the sake of what - a payday?


And so you fix the dent in your car, replace the carpet, buy the anniversary gift, and schedule a trip to the Andes, all while paying for her father's treatment. But something is missing.


She never notices the fixed dent. She's ambivalent about the new carpet. When you present to her the gift on your anniversary, she puts on a fake smile and thanks you dearly, but you know her well enough to see right through it. On the trip, she seems depressed. She loves you all the same, but cant get over what was put at stake. It remains a thorn in her side that festers and never fully heals.


So be glad you are in this universe instead of that one. Seems like you made the right decision to me."

"Haha no more like y'all and my stupid country sayings. My friend's wife finds ""dumber'n owl shit"" highlarious"
I'll bring that fun fact up next time I'm eating my dinner with the family.
hmmm.. so she's your gf... and you're 25... but you have a wife and 3 kids? yeah ok... *rolls eyes*
And the sass of his ass was eclipsed by its mass.
"Years ago, my college GF and I tried shower sex. She too passed out and slid down the wall, leaving a gnarly scratch on her butt and back where the faucet bit her. 

Good times all around... "
"The fastest time to eat a drinking glass is 1 min 27 sec and was achieved by Patesh Talukdar (India) on the set of Guinness World Records - Ab India Todega in Mumbai, India, on 10 March 2011. Patesh also eats other things such as plastic or ceramics."
I once made my pregnant wife throw up from a single fart. Top ten proud moments of my life.

Damn that sucks. Dont know what you did wrong. Upvote for the statutory rape.

Fantastic Breasts and Where to Find Them
"Makes me feel better hearing someone with the same story. I seriously don't blame her though because I know that in reality it was a risky investment, no way to know it would pay off so crazy."
"You should ask to r/lockpicking
It's a nice and helpful community. "
Well. See you on the front page. Did you ever get a response from her though?
"Dude... this is not a TIFU. You got a great story of sibling bonding, no one got hurt, and you did a good thing. This is the kind of shit you'll laugh about for the rest of your life, and a thing that you'll never regret. Good on ya. "
"In high school I was having sex with my girlfriend, she was on top totally naked. My dad isn't really one to knock, because ""it's his house"". So he waltzed right in, full frontal view of what was happening, he slammed the door back shut as fast as he opened it. And THEN proceeded to knock. ""Brian come up stairs I need to talk to you"" he then gave me the whole 'don't get her pregnant' routine while I was still sweaty.. Definitely my most awkward dad moment. "
"I'm gonna level with you: I would've been upset with you for ruining /r/me_irl if the sub weren't already ruined by the ""X updoots and I'll Y"" trend.    "
"Christ almighty man.


I'm goin through some rough shit right now...so thanks for reminding me that I could have accidentally emailed my Harry Potter fanfic to my entire job."
They should've just done the twin bed thing. 
/u/waterguy12 would also like this. 
"I'm not sure where you live but where I live you usually get your change and then if you leave tip it's collected when they clean the table...

"I don't believe you, how could someone possibly video themselves masturbating?
I'm afraid we need some proof OP, or you just might be bamboozling us."
Ez pz promotion
"Don't even sweat it. The first time I met my girlfriend, I threw up on her. We've been together over 2 years now. "
"See I have the opposite problem. My wife thinks I know about money and what to do with it, cause I got her to buy some mutual funds, so whenever I have an idea she says to ""go for it"". Anyone want a couple cases of fidget spinners?"
See most girls would be proud there pussy put you in a coma she clearly wasn't a keeper.
Mmmm why is there a balloon in my wallet?
I'll even use this title
Stealing the copy pasta for my own use
But I think she was a racist
You can do that. This is the internet. 
¿Porque no los dos? 
"Why the fuck did she leave? Any decent person, no matter whether they had feelings for you or were just a fwb or fuckbuddy, would have stayed and helped and made sure you were okay."
"Oh, it's just a Harry Potter fanfic... a porn fanfic!

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Oh.

(ಠ_ಠ) 

Oh no."
He didnt do anything wrong. The girl was uptight. 
"I swear this story is from the 1000 episode of Joe Rogan Podcast yesterday. Joey Diaz tells the story of how when he farts in bed and it creeps into his CPAP he knows it's a good one and has to wake up his wife so that she can experience it too.

Edit: how fucking good was that podcast people? One of the best for sure. Joey's stories about taking a shit in his neighbours yard and the story that almost killed Tom Segura. The three of them should make a sitcom. "
If it's any consolation you would've likely sold them after they doubled in price and not sat on them til now anyway.'
You should be able to go into any BDSM shop and ask for a spare. They told me that their locks and keys are (typically) universal for exactly this reason. 
"""What are you gonna put on your resume? Dumbass?"""
He farts in your CPAP?
"Piggybacking top comment:

Op chill. Those older women you work with are probably all desperate horny old broads who secretly read 50 shades of grey and whatnot. Dont care how religious they seem. Theyll probably rub one out to your fanfic. 

You should go into work tomorow and try to sell them some copies instead of resigning... "
Note to self: throw up on ladies
Who knew a double cheeseburger could be healthier than a nugget. Hah!
Ask your 18 aunts and uncles
"&gt;You can begin by posting the Hermione chapters here, OP.

You sly bastard. Plot Twist: OP works in a Star Wars NSFW fan-fiction site."
The Wet Banditess strikes again
So don't spend any less time masturbating.
"""Like rubes?"" ""Now you're on the trolley."""
Well in this case it would be better...
well make sure you send it to the right fucking address
Urine trouble now!
I never saw the divorce coming!
"You forgot 5, it's a dude pretending to be a chick ."
 Too much ass the lass took a pass. 
I believe you meant *ejaculation*
Seems like you may have unintentionally autoerotically asphyxiated yourself slightly... 
"Half of me wants to claim mod abuse, the other half is with you on this."
"Hey bud, sorry to hear about this. That sucks.

Word of medical advice: the choking and ""food getting stuck in your throat"" you describe can be a severe symptom of an underlying problem. It's Severe Acid Reflux Disease and/or GERD. Your esophagus is probably inflamed, and is causing food to occasionally catch. This can be stress related, diet related, related to secondary/primary illnesses, etc.

My suggestion is to suggest to your doctor (""I choked on a chicken nugget"" is more common than GERD/SARD, and if you started with that and didn't mention to your doctor that ""Hey, this happens every so often and I'm worried"", they may not investigate further), that you may have GERD or SARD. Ask for a gastroenterologist referral. 

Might just save your life bro, having GERD or SARD untreated can cause esophogial cancer. Hope I'm wrong, homie, best wishes."
Best 30 seconds of his life
"You could just explain that it was something funny/shocking you found online and meant to send to a friend? Just profusely apologize to your supervisor/HR and say you're willing to resign and understand why it might be best, but that you hope it can be seen for what it is- a sad, silly mistake. 

You may still get a slap on the wrist for being careless, but this could all blow over."
"What you want to do is put a condom over you entire forearm and then go in for the shake. 

This confidently shows dad that you care not only about his daughter's safety, but those around you. "
"""It was his first birthday..."" Ummmmmm what. 

""...after moving from Washington to California"" Ah. Okay, carry on..."
Please. No more coconuts.
Well his farts turn into this green gas that wafts into my CPAP machine. 
"Just watched this episode today, glad someone referenced it"
"I think it's awesome your response was ""oh no! That's me!""  Was your face showing? If it wasn't feel like you could have gone with ""what the hell!? There's porn on my laptop!"" "
"_At that point you just_

_Might as well go all in and_

I'll have to tell that one to my pot smoking friend, he'd get a kick out of that one."
" After being seated at our table and our orders taken my dad went to the bathroom and later about 10 minutes after he got back I had to go drain the snake myself but as I was walking away my Dad said ""try and make a hole in the ice!"" Now that confused me but I ignored it and continued to the bathroom. On to the fuck up, when I got to the bathroom I saw a very long tray filled with ice, after using the urinal I thought of what my dad said about ""making a hole in the ice"" and I threw some soap on my hand and went to wash my hands in the ice, it was very weird and innefective so I shoved my hand in deeper and made the ""hole"" with my hand and kinda let my body heat melt it to wash the soap off. When I was satisfied I dried my hands and went back to eat. 

 After arriving back at my table I ate some of everyone's wings just as the second coming of wings arrived I said ""never seen a hand washing thing like that ice"" my dad just gave me a weird look and asked ""are you joking"" to which I responded ""No, why?"" My dad looks at me and goes ""The ice is not for your hands it's for pissing in"" I then proceeded like the average weak stomached teen to throw up all of the wings I've eaten on the new wings that just arrived causing my young  sister to fall out of her chair screaming, my dad to jump up throwing his beer and my mom to puke on some people next to us. I swore off any wings for the next 4 years."
"What if this is her true calling?  What if it is called ""Fifty Shades of Potter"" and takes Hollywood by storm, becoming the next big thing!?  A new genre that recycles blockbusters with kids and turns them into hard R rated films that explore their sexual lives once they have matured.  You could be a part of history, man!"
For getting me out of a cock cage?
"I was talking to my friend on the phone once. He lived across country so they were usually long calls. I was prepping to end the call because my battery was low, but for some reason I couldn't remember how to phrase it so I said something like ""my phone is running out of charge points"". He never lets me live it down. "
"Casually drowning?  I can deal with it later.

New headphones about to break?  SHIT SHIT SHIT GET OUT OF THE WATER!"
The most surprising part was that it was a woman. I thought it was a coconut.
TIFU by not putting a TLDR at the end of my TIFU
Well I guess you guys did eat sand if you think about it. 
"I would have sex with someone for a model S. I'd have sex with someone for a Model 3. Hell, I'd do it just to ride in one. "
"As a dad with a daughter, I would be more concerned with who she is sharing it with than the image itself. Since it's your bf, I wouldn't worry about it coming up again. 
Of course you still have to live with the fact that your dad saw your bits, cringy."
Jesus that last girl needs a hug and a better family.
"*pokes you with stick*

Say more things. "
"Yep, plus, I have wired earphones plugged in to my phone pretty much 24/7."
That is honestly my only guess as to why she got so mad.  She thought OP was mocking her.
"Yeah, mayonnaise doesn't really pour out of a jar. I don't get why he wouldn't just use a spoon, since that would be faster than trying to shake it out. But he shouldn't have used the mayonnaise at all anyway, food that's been touched by broken glass is inedible in my opinion. 

Edit: the jars are little, so you'd use a butter knife. "
Except for when you slip and die
Atleast you didn't get one back
Seems like ppl over sexualize the details of the story just to get upvotes. Do people masturbate to TIFUor or something ?
"I beg to differ, it sure felt like a FU while I was washing shit off my naked brother-in-law and trying to wash shit out of a modem..."
Go to the doctor/hospital now.
And I thought my dad vomiting out the window on the interstate going 70mph and not missing a beat was amazing...........
Not a deal breaker.
"This comment made laugh, cry, and want to hug you (or if you feel hugging to be off-putting or condescending, to convey genuine human compassion to you in some other manner). 

But let me just say this.

1) It is okay to imagine and write fan fic about Hermione and Lucius. Of course it is.  

2) You are not a shit writer. 

3) This fuck up was a human and technological mistake. It is not the universe personally attacking you. It is not trying to tell you to stop writing.

4) You are a good person. You are worthy of love and care.

Peace out.

Maybe it's just me but my cum always sort or fries into a cooked spermy fluid in hot showers
