You have a face for podcasts
When you're created in God's image but he just uses the thumbnail
"Don't worry, rollercoasters aren't that much fun anyway."
Hard to say “I’m not like the other girls” when you copy your whole personality from your only friend
The roast just started. Why the long face?
I'm assuming you have no way out because you no longer fit through the doors
How many girls have you gone up on?
"A degree in animation, eh? You must either really enjoy being a barista or really enjoy disappointing your parents... Either way, at least it'll give you something to talk about to your 3 listeners."
*gets jumped on by mario* 
I look forward to watching your version of toy story.
I bet that’s the exact same face you’ll make after they find the bodies of your victims.
Hate to see make up tested on animals.
If a hat fell off your head it would be out of fashion before it reaches your chin.
You look like the older sister in every movie before 2000
When ooompa loompas goes to gender studies
"17 my ass, she at least 32. "
You got the Body type of a 2X2 in tetris
"2 girls, 1 nope."
What the fuck is that
Let those boys go. Their mothers miss them. 
"Most girls your age like to have fun and let their hair down, you just let your parents down."
Chaturbates isn't a podcast
"CNA, huh? How's your Mary Kay side business going?"
"You're a few tattoos shy of the classic 

""Girlfriend who doesn't pay rent and promises to contribute....someday."""
I've seen 3 year olds with more fashion sense.
Why I don’t want kids: Exhibit A
Looks like you take 3 hour lunches
This is what happens when you keep your thoughts to yourself
You look like the photo Michael Jackson gave to his plastic surgeon
"CNA: Held to Professional Requirements but paid like the head cashier at the dollar store.

Honey, I can't Roast you. You've done that yourself."
"Jesus titty fucking Christ, you've got some man hands"
"You're the poster girl for ""what kind of white girls do black guys like"""
One more year and boys can turn you down legally.
"You like the kinda guy who slides into girls dm's with

"If we asked 10 random artists to draw a stereotypical unskilled labor cashier, 8 of them would draw this woman. "
"No no no, show one of the other 753 pictures you took before this one."
you look like an advertisement for date rape
Modeling $96 Victoria Secret thongs to cover up $4 worth of pussy
"You're lying. You were the main star in the movie ""Antz"""
Please give some of your forehead to her chin
"Honey, where is my fidget spinner?! "
They forgot the third tower
I'm surprised you didn't get fired for looking at hentai yet 
"Verified User on PornHub, confirmed."
"Still not sure about gender.
"
Wow I thought I was on r/crappycontouring for a second 
You’re one of the girls that only takes pictures from the tits up because below that looks like a walrus wrapped in rubber bands.
"I’m fucking WHEEZING, you look like the midget Drake meme.

When you get in the bath, is there a little “ploop” sound effect?"
all those clocks yet you still can't tell it's time to stop dressing like a high schooler. 
Does the “one child policy” count if you mail your kid to a different country?
"Careful, you shouldn't give out personal information online, like that you have three younger sisters. "
CNA? Congrats on finishing 2 weeks of schooling .
"You look like frozone's autistic cousin, brozone."
"Ugh, clearly not a hand model."
I didn't think they would allow hitler's gay cousin in the military.
If Bill Murray had to play the role of a girl.
"2 girls, 1 rope."
Mayor of the friend zone.
You posted the boyfriend photo again by mistake
The funny thing is that they both think they are the pretty friend
This bitch could walk through an entire men's prison and still come out a virgin. 
Anniversary of what? Triple bypass? 
"Thats a soccer mom, not a 17 year old"

Did you ever make it past the casting couch? 
"You're not wrong in thinking your appearance immediately evokes terrorists and 9/11, but it's because your head is the height of one of the towers before any planes were involved. "
WHAT'S UUUUUP YOUTUBE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTUBE! IT'S CUSTOM GROWN 420
“I’m not like the other guys” *  asks for nudes/sex on the second snap  *
"Is your podcast named, ""Trapped behind a man's face?"" "
The fact you can't even throw up the horns properly says all we need to know.
You look like your go to move in a fight is to inform the other combatant that your father is a lawyer
Those clocks are your parents way of hinting it's time to move out
"Wait, if she's disapppinting her parents, who are the other 2 listeners?"
"Everything about this screams, ""This was at my mom's house"""
You should look at his comment history.. It’s pretty fucked up..
"The haircut says either vegan or lesbian, so she wanted to clear that up."
Dont forget the piercing and tatoos wont make your dad pay attention to you either 
She should dab a bit of toothpaste on the toothbrush more often. 
I am sure the insights of a minimum wage 18-year old are compelling.
"Say what you want about his appearance, he seems really down-to-earth. "
You are the first world problem. 
32 with three kids and drives a mini-van with the little stick family stickers
"2 girls, no hope"
Your whole life needs a hairnet 
Bored at work stuck in the same chair*
I thought Steven Hawking passed away yesterday 
What a faguette 
"50k in student debt, won't earn 50k animating in her lifetime."
They said no because you expected them to. You lack confidence and fear criticism.
The only thing harder than the way the opposite sex roasted you is figuring out which one is the actual opposite sex 
And the other 2 would draw her mother.
"This is one of those classic posts where all your roast worthy flaws aren't visible in the picture. You're going to uni so you're at least competently smart, good for you. You used to model, so you know you're attractive. You've got a couple things going for you, so why post a picture where you're clearly trying to look good on this subreddit? What happened in your life to make you crave praise and attention, so much so that you need to put yourself out there online to be made fun of? Of course everyone will attack your appearance, but you know inside that you're not ugly, making their insults have the opposite effect of what was intended. I'm guessing you had a cold, distant upbringing. You never got the attention you needed as a child, and as a result have struggled to form meaningful relationships, none that have lasted at least. You could have found emotional warmth at school, but your lack of any real personality meant that you were never close to popular and always excluded.  As you got older you constantly needed reassurance from anyone because you never developed a true sense of self worth. Your anxiety and lack of meaningful social skills have kept you from seeking out comfort in appropriate ways, so you resort to putting yourself in situations where you can't possibly fail.  A guaranteed win is just the little boost you need, because  I'll bet that your relationship with family and friends was so distant that you only received attention when you succeeded, and now you need little victories here and there to feel any sense of worth. This is why you feel the need to stay up at night and post pictures to a sub where you know, in the end, no one will really get to you and you'll win out, temporarily bringing your self esteem up to the levels of a normal person. I'd like to say you'll have a good university career, but realistically it will start out okay then slowly be destroyed by your years of psychological distress.  Four years riddled with anxiety and depression will turn into several years searching for a mediocre job. In that time your looks will fade, you'll still have no measurable personality, and you'll settle into a life that could be considered average at best. "
Are you telling me this isn’t a 3 year old?
Forehead Nightingale
"Bitch I hate you!

Youre not even cute smh

Holy shit why would someone with that history post a picture of themselves 
"Your face says teen pregnancy, but your hair says awkward virgin. Color me confused."
Don't you have to be photogenic to be a model?
"Who gives a shit about an 18 year old's podcast? This isn't a roast, honestly wondering why you came up with such an idea. Towering narcissism of course, but why else?"
What I’m really wondering is how many people she tells she’s a “nurse” when she’s not wearing the CNA tag.
