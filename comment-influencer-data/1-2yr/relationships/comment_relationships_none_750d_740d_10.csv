Then I guess you know what your future looks like: supporting ingrates who want to henpeck and live beyond their means. 
he doesn't have to cheat in order for this situation to be inappropriate for someone in a relationship.
"Actually, I'd advise OP to install cameras. If he left a note once he'll leave another note. It's quite possible that it's only one person, and I can't see what HR can actually do without knowing the culprit. The kind of investigation HR would do is unlikely to turn anything up; that is, it would be easy for the culprit to hide behind anonymity once they know there is an investigation."
"I don't think your wife remembers 2004 properly, kids were still obese and stuck to their mobile phone if they had one, just not a smart phone. "
"Job.  
Now.   
Any job.   
Get the heck out of dodge.   
You are continuing to remain in a cycle of abuse. "
"Just treat your new sister like a person. She's also dealing with huge life changes and I'm sure that moving in with you guys isn't a walk in the park for her either.

Also, you guys aren't related and it isn't like she's your actual biological sister. Don't beat yourself up for finding her attractive. Just don't go invading her space to get off or anything. 

You're overthinking this way too much. You only have a few more years living together anyways until you go off to college (if that's your plan)."
"Sounds like it could straight up buy a house. 
"
"This is actually the most solid advice in my opinion. Triple your emergency fund and then put the rest into something you can't or wouldn't want to touch till that down payment day should come. If you wanted to, to feel like you would be helping, you could use some of that newly inflated emergency fund to fund a greater portion of a vacation down the line when you two absolutely need to just get away. This should keep your dynamic the same since you won't have the extra cash on hand to do more besides that one vacation or rare splurge while skylar still gets to chip away at the student loan unhindered and couldn't be upset knowing you have a lot of money since you have a long term plan to provide for your (or both yours) future. "
"This is exactly what I was thinking.  Groom needs to have a face-to-face with his parents and lay down the law.  Stress to them that his fianc√©e will soon be his wife (regardless of their attempts to sabotage), and that their behavior now dictates how much contact they will have in the future with the couple as a new family.

Bringing the brother and best man just solidifies the seriousness of the situation that future MIL has created."
"&gt;How do I get out of this situation?

Learn how to say no. That's really all there is to it.

&gt;I don't want to fuck up this friendship

well, on the plus side, if you did, that's already done. 

The faster you're honest, the better of you'll be, and the better chance of saving a friendship"
"It's likely the trauma, abuse and manipulation of her parents and her brother have eroded her sense of self-esteem and threshold of what she accepts as normal/healthy. From your description that she does not have friends or has trouble with doing things for herself sounds like she definitely has social anxiety/anxiety/depression. She needs therapy. It's not your responsibility to take care of her mental health or safety. If you're capable of suggesting therapy, having her work through her obvious traumatic past/family, distancing herself away from her family and you see her actually put in the work then it's a relationship worth holding onto if you do love her and want to be there for her. However, you need to put your mental health before hers - otherwise you're not doing anyone any favours."
"This is such good advice. I read somewhere (probably on this sub) that being in a relationship is a choice we make every single day. You wake up each morning and decide to put your heart into it, through the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

""The one"" is a weird romantic illusion that really just defines the person that's worthy of that very active choice! "

"Honestly, I mean, who *doesn't* fit her deal breakers? There isn't a person...."
"&gt;""you know, you should give him more space. Make him miss you more.""

... which will allow me the opportunity to mark my territory and win him back all while documenting it on social media for all to see. Seriously, OP, this girl is a piece of work and I wouldn't trust her as far as I could throw her.

Your boyfriend is going to have to choose who gets hurt in this situation. You - his girlfriend - who is rightly concerned and is being *more than* reasonable in this situation, or her - his ex - who is disrespecting you and stomping all over your boundaries to the point where even other people are wondering WTF is going on, because it's clear she still has feelings for him.

&gt;How he handles this predicament and whether he can respect my request for boundaries will determine if I stay or go.

Well said. 

It sounds like you've got this, OP. The ball's in your boyfriend's court now, just make sure you stick to your guns."
"I understand and I'm sorry that this is such a heartbreaking situation. Still, I urge you to look at this objectively. Truthfully, purposefully ruining someone's relationship through cheating(already emotional cheating at this point) because it contains abuse is still extremely immoral and in no way healthy for the victim. You're only pushing her from one unhealthy situation into another. She'll look back on that and feel massive amounts of shame, abuse or not he is still the father of her child and she feels a connection to him, otherwise she wouldn't still be there. Add that onto the potential strain it could have in your relationship and you've got a recipe for disaster. The thing about abusive relationships and any relationship is that in order to help someone they also need to seek help. It's sad, but it's the truth. And this is coming from an abuse victim. There is nothing better you can do for her other than keep being her best friend and giving her the magnificent effect you have in her life. 

Help her as her *friend*, first and foremost. You don't need to be her S/O to get her into therapy and be by her side through this traumatic experience. And on the her pushing you away thing, do not take her word on her emotions. It sounds cruel, but you cannot rely on them. If she's in a terrible position with her boyfriend and happens to look through her contacts that day, she's going to go 'I'll just text him! Yeah, I pushed him away...because I love him! I love him! He'll help me, so I love him!'. She is psychologically warped and has been for five years, she no doubt has a *complete* disconnect from her emotions and desperate times are all the time. Be smart and be a good friend, but protect yourself as well. 

On the 'she's the one' thing, if she truly is and you love her then she is worth the wait. If she chooses to stay with this abusive man and continue to use you as her emotional cushion(as well as her child's at some point, no doubt) without adding anything to the relationship other than her presence, then walk away. You have tons of time to fall in love, there are a million possibilities for meeting the one. And considering your clearly caring and kind nature, it won't be too hard. You've stayed hung up on the same girl for years upon years, if you've had trouble meeting anyone else it's because it's clear to anyone that you love her. "
This is an avalanche of red flags.  Do not ever let someone treat you this way in a relationship.
"You're doing your best for your family and that is amazing. I have nothing really to add surrounding your relationship with your brother but it seems like for now you are truly doing what you can for your daughter. 

The only thing that I ask is whether you think that your current job will have a negative affect on achieving a career in your field (early education)? I may be completely wrong (and PLEASE ignore me if I am because, again, you're doing everything you can to provide for your daughter) but would it not be beneficial to find work that you could put on a resume for your future career? Or one that would not put that career at risk? 
Like if a parent of a child you taught learned of your job history - that could go bad. 

Anyways, again, you're amazing for providing for your child. "
"I'd point how how negatively her behaviors affect her productivity. Sounds like she can't be all that focused on her work duties if she's ready to drop everything at a dime to follow someone into the bathroom, or to simply wait IN the bathroom.

At my job, I have a line of sight to the entry of both washrooms at all times. I could not tell you who is in the bathroom or for how long. Hell, I've had instances where I was looking for someone and they turned out to be in a bathroom - I was simply too focused on work to pay attention to who walked by me to go to the goddamn bathroom."
Just call CPS on them. That should keep them occupied.
"While I think the ultimatum is still necessary, this is what I would say to explain why the ultimatum is necessary. I had a friend who quit a good job to design websites.... With no website / computer experience, no design experience, no technical knowledge whatsoever. It was just easy money in his head. Turns out he just ended up playing video games all day and smoking weed while his finance held down a full time job. Somehow they are still together (and even got married). He now had a new job and makes a living once again, but he lost a lot of potential income. I tried to explain to him that that kind of work is supplemental income and that he shouldn't quit his day job unless business really took off, which was going to require lots of experience in that field and building a portfolio. Just my two cents. "
"And to threaten legal action if the bosses dont do anything. Racist comments are the very definition of ""hostile workplace""."
"I also live in a Victorian era home converted into apartments. My upstairs neighbors' every movement can be heard through the ceiling. Imagine two guys and a gigantic dog stomping around all day every day. And yes, I've heard them have sex - and it was around 1 AM, not 11 PM. 

But here's the thing. That's apartment living, and what we all signed up for when we moved into housing like this. 

Now, sure, we have a duty to reasonably mitigate the noise we inflict. The reality of the situation isn't license to do whatever, whenever. But having sex at 10-11 PM on a bed that's not banging the wall or creaking, not screaming and moaning? That just comes with the territory of shared housing arrangements. 

You can try rugs, soundproofing vents, having sex earlier all to keep the peace, but I think your neighbor perhaps has some unrealistic expectations about his or her living situation if some mattress squeaking and groans at 11 o'clock are over the line."
"I think I am just confused that you didn't mention it then and there. I understand being non-confrontational, and this isn't meant as a personal attack. In my opinion, it absolutely needs to be addressed and the longer it's put off, the less she's going to understand the impact.

I'm wondering if she ended up significantly busier than expected and it resulted in neglecting your bird. This can happen with people who've never have pets, or have never been personally responsible for one.

I'm in the camp that the friendship is salvageable (I had a similar situation with a friend) but she is not to be trusted with your bird ever again."
"&gt;  it looks like her dad's cars will be in storage until at least when my stepson can drive, which is at least another 8 years

This is insane. Your stepson could go to college with that money. Does she really want that to be her father's legacy to her kids?"
"If you are a bad or mean drunk, stop drinking as it will only add troubles to your life.

You've had your first lesson, make it your last"
"You need to reframe this event. You didn't ""fail at marriage"", you succeeded at realizing that this marriage wasn't what you wanted for your future, and you had the courage to take a positive step for your happiness and future goals. You didn't let anyone down by divorcing--other people will get over it or not but the baggage they loaded on your relationship was never yours to carry. If you had stayed with someone you knew wasn't right for you, you would have let yourself down.

Where do you go from here? Forward. One foot in front of the other. Like the rest of us, every day, for all our lives. :)"
"Dude, you were never exclusive. Chill out bro. She can be with whoever she wants. If you want exclusivity with this girl, ask her out and talk about it. Does she know that you're a virgin? It's ok to not be good at sex when you start. Nobody ever is. "
"Yes.  If you don't tell your husband, you will have to deal with this sitting on you mind forever.  He should appreciate your honesty and the fact that you didn't wait to tell him what happened."
"If I was a referee I would be throwing red flags all over the field! You can't be with someone who expect you to fight for her physically from something that she starts. I can see you at best losing friends/job opportunities, at worst, going to jail."
Even at 30 years old. I think this is behavior kinda adorable.  Ask him out.
"His free trial of Second Mother has run out. If he wants to eat special food, he'd better stop 'hating' cooking and pretending he doesn't know how to do it (literally anyone with a computer can learn to cook)."
"I don't usually respond to posts from abused people because it's emotionally draining when I can tell they won't leave, and I was in an abusive live-in situation that basically functioned as a marriage in the past, so it's difficult to see someone in the same spot sometimes.

But! You sound like you WILL leave. Maybe not today, but I can tell you know you should and that you will. Yay!

What I want to say is that you will look back on this time period and be thrilled you left. Life will be waaay better, even if for a while it sucks. (It took at least six months after I left before I stopped having constant anxiety attacks.) 

But with the therapy, and with the confidence boost of having been strong enough to leave, life will only improve. And then eventually you'll get well enough to choose good (or at least not awful!) relationships. And in time you'll find some other great person.

Seriously, someday you'll be with somebody who is appalled by your current husband's behavior and maybe you and that future person will even be able to laugh about how ridiculous your husband is. ""Oh my God, he REALLY did that?!?"" from somebody who actually loves you is definitely a thing you'll hear. It will feel like it was some other life.

I was abused as a kid too. It's hard for people who've been through the sort of stuff we've been through to learn how to pick good partners. But you can do it. I have faith in you. "
"You're only two years married. If you guys had been married for decades, with kids, I'd say maybe this is worth sticking out and working through.  Maybe.

At two years, no kids? Divorce this sad bastard. He's insecure and manipulative, and if you stay with him you're basically saying that what he did ""worked."" He will feel empowered and will only lie and try to manipulate you more.

When someone shows you their true colors, pay attention.

Sorry OP.  Thank goodness you didn't waste more time on him."
"No, you're not wrong. Your girlfriend's sister got exactly what she deserved.

&gt; My gf has been saying this is the girls fault for 'ruining their relationship' and wants to tale revenge.

Your girlfriend shouldn't be involved in this, but the fact that she thinks this poor girl ""ruined"" Cindy's relationship and that she needs to take revenge against her is very concerning. If I were you, I'd be reconsidering my relationship. "
"OP, you've been with this guy for 2 months and he's proven that he's ok with seriously breaching your trust already. Move on. Don't continue dating a guy who broke your trust so seriously 2 months in."
"&gt; Mark and John make plans without me all the time and then they just include me

Girl, this is not like going to a concert. You keep making excuses for the guy that drugged you without consent."
You go to college in a different town.

Did you tell your mom that you'd have a normal sibling relationship if your brother wasn't an incestuous pervert
"Not judging on her job choices, but if she's having a sexual relationship with you while boning a bunch of other dudes on the side, you deserved to know about that for the sake of your damn health.

Did you even discuss whether or not you two were sexually exclusive? Because that's a conversation you should have had a bunch of months ago."
She probably just goes in that house to pet the owner's lizard.
"There used to be a sign in Boston that I saw everyday:

""You're not bored. You're boring.""

You can't tell her that either, I'd guess. The essence is, obviously, that it's your own responsibility to make your life interesting, wherever you are. "
"Your brother cares far too much about labels, as soon as he goes into the real world and realises that the people he works with (or even better, those he works for) didn't have a top 5, Ivy League education then he'll realise what an arse he's been."
"You went above and beyond for someone that didn't deserve even one ounce of even your respect. You aren't responsible, you aren't guilty. You did more than 99% of ex-wive's would do."
You are in an abusive relationship. She is emotionally abusive and controlling. Her behaviour will only get worse. Let her play the victim. Break up with her. Let her do and say whatever to her friends and family. Your health and sanity are worth it. You will become a shell of a person if you stay. Let her play the victim because as long as you stay with her you are actually the victim. 
Oh God I'd lose my mind. And I love sex. Being pawed 24/7 sounds awful

"Does he not realize that most of these ""YouTube/Instagram"" stars are either extremely attractive, extremely good at another hobby, or spent *years* gaining traction? He'll drive himself broke if he does this. 

Is it easier to put up a few YouTube videos every week than it is to go to a 9-5 work day? Sure. But it's infinitely more difficult to make even minimum wage off of such an endeavor let alone a living wage. 

Hope ya'll aren't engaged."
"Okay for starters, as a person who has been hit by a drunk driver, fuck anyone who gets behind the wheel after consuming alcohol to the point where they are even close to getting a DUI. Seriously, I've blown a .09(Not while driving) and I was way past the point of even thinking about getting behind a wheel. To have so little disregard for another persons life makes them a piece of shit. 

Also, your drug addicted friend got you into trying their drug of choice? 

Trashy social medias make me absolutely cringe. Now I don't know what your husbands definition of ""trashy"" is but if it's close to my definition than I can see why he would have a problem with it. I think it's less of a ""control"" issue and more of a ""I don't want my friends and family to see **my wife** acting this way on social media"" issue.

Your husband sounds like a caring, true adult while you sound like you are still hanging out with your HS buddies that haven't grown up. I'm surprised he hasn't given you the ultimatum of them or him yet. The maturity difference is already noticeable just by reading this post.

I will say that going out to the bar and having a few drinks with friends is never something your husband should get mad at. If you Uber there and back or have a DD and don't have any history of cheating or breaking trust and you also give him the option to go...I see no issue with that aspect."
"This. People who absolve themselves of responsibility for cheating by saying that the affair partner is their true love like OP and his ""lady"" can't be trusted to not act impulsively and selfishly the next time they feel new relationship energy."
It's not a threat if that's where this is going. She's destabilizing the marriage with her behavior. How much longer are you willing to put up with this behavior?
you've been together a year and now you know he sees things as how much money is contributed. he spelled it out for you. you put in x amount of money and that's how much your opinion is worth. that kind of attitude is toxic in a relationship.
"After reading your post and some of your follow-up comments - is there ANYTHING your girlfriend has said she would do, or really should do, and *actually* followed through on? The doctor, updating medical info, counseling, the knee exercises from 4 years ago...

This would be a huge dealbreaker for me. How functional is she in her day to day life? I mean, from the brief picture you've painted here I wouldn't even trust her to follow-through on dropping a letter into a mailbox for me..."
"Came here to say I agree x10,000 times. I was diagnosed with depression at that age and he sounds exactly like me. Word for word.

If you can't get his parents to do that there are other things you can do to help. Make sure he eats tasty healthy meals when you see him and try and do some physical activities together... even under the guise of helping you keep healthy. Eating and physical exercise can really help. Make sure he knows he's a good kid too and help him with his self worth in any way you can too, show him you're proud of him. He might shrug it off but some of it will go in."
"Your husband is a saint. 

Take the other guy off the table. Then decide how you feel. You can't be in two relationships at once, not in this situation, not in these circumstances."
"Don't get sucked into a debate. A marriage is not like high school debate club where you win by scoring the most points. It's supposed to be a partnership where you work on disagreements together in good faith. It's supposed to be you and your spouse against the problem, not you against your spouse. Is your husband really doing that?  Is he willing to *try* doing that? "
And where is the respect coming from his side?
The SIL did get first pick of the room and chose where they wanted to stay. Then she wanted to backtrack on it and make the other couple move. No thanks. You get what you get and you don't throw a fit. Some people just need to be called out when they act ridic. Shes probably never acted this way before because shes used to getting her way. 
"Meet with both of them and tell them in no uncertain terms that if she wont stop, she will not be alone with her. I would be enraged at someone not respecting my rules pertaining to my child. Last resort is visitation at someplace other than his home"
"Your mother cut her family off, but she has no authority to speak on your behalf. If you want relationships, etc from your grandparents, uncles, and all that jazz, she can't stop you. I'd recommend reaching out if you want them as support in your life. Make it clear that you are not your mother and you desire them in your life."
"I'm curious to see what OP's mom would do if she refused to get in the car to move again. Would she call the police to force her? Or beg? Or perhaps tell her the truth? 

A kid who moved to my town did something similar to this. He was at our school for 2 months before he was set to move again. He refused to leave. His mom kept begging, he kept refusing. I know all of this because a neighbor called the police because of the shouting. It was discovered that she kidnapped her son after family court ruled in her ex husbands favor for sole custody. The father never stopped looking for him, which was why the mother moved him around so much.

I'm not saying she should actually do this, but I'm saying is OP pulled a ""call the police if you have to. I'm not getting in that car until you tell me what's really going on, or the police tell me to get in. You're hiding something."" My experience is a bit extreme, but it's not all that unlikely that she's running from a stalker of something."
"Jesus Christ, dude. Telling her to 'shut up' during a meeting? It doesn't matter if she's being a 'know-it-all,' that was incredibly unprofessional of you. Beyond that, STEM fields are heavily male dominated and sexism is pervasive, she probably feels like she has something to prove. 

What it sounds like to me is that she's being proactive to try to get you on her side. I bet you anything that you humiliated her in that meeting."
"Hi, my Mom died when I was 25.
I am the only girl, I have two brothers.
I got ALL the jewellery. All of it. It wasn't even a question of ""who gets the wedding rings"". I did. Hell I'm even now getting my Aunts jewellery (my Mom's sister) as she only had boys and their wives don't want it and I'm sentimental as all get out!

You may be asking for a ring that is not his to give anymore, he may have already split the jewellery between his daughters.

So yes, just talk to your Dad. Tell him you want to propose and would like use your Mom's ring. (And say RING not diamond, and for pete's sake don't get it reset, getting it reset means you're not even sentimental about the ring, you just want the stone, which, c'mon dude, either the ring is special or it isn't, it can't be both.)"
"Sure. But you're not the one wearing it. I know if I was your sister and you just kept the stone and replaced the band to make the ring ""special"" when I, as a person who *knew* mom and would have gladly worn the ring as is - I'd be pretty upset."
"""I let her hook up with me""

I'm done. I'm exiting this planet. "
"I mean... To be honest you sound like kind of an asshole to her, and if she is already someone who is overly dependent on people she's going to be more because she wants to feel a connection with you that just isn't there.  Let her go, or better yet she should dump you."
"So your friend was caught DUI once after who knows how many times driving drunk, and you tried cocaine to help your addicted friend? I feel bad that your husband has to put up with you and your poor choice of friends. "
"Hahaha, nice. But seriously, run. It's not the stupidity of trying to cheat this running thing.

Its the fact that he doesn't care about you saying ""no"". Who wants to deal with being talked into something constantly just to get some peace. A month of time isn't any loss. Next"
"His unfulfilled longings never go unfulfilled long. Like for example with his job, he was a salesman at his company. Was the first person in the company to ever hit the 1 million dollars in sales mark in a year within 5 years of being there, he did it his 3rd year. One night not long after this after he had gotten an award for doing it, were in bed and he says to me ""you know, I think I want to be an engineer"" I said ok we should look at what schools in the area offer night classes for degrees in engineering. About 2 months later he comes home and tells me he's been promoted to an engineer. Like what? He has an associates degree in marketing. "
I think she made it pretty clear her preference was the 3 year mark.
"I hate giving this advice, but I would keep your head down and look for a new job. Your manager certainly sounds like a sexist asshat, but you don't have a slam-dunk case. With him being the owner's son, I think it will rebound far more negatively on you if you report him to HR. 

In addition, if your company has placed the owner's incompetent son in a managerial role, they are probably making shoddy business decisions in other areas as well. The fish rots from the head. I would just get out."
"&gt;she was taking advantage of my naivete and eagerness

23 is old enough to own up to your side of the situation. You gave her your number, you called her, you agreed to meet up with her. I agree that it sucks you're probably going to have to get a new job, but at least recognize the mistakes you made here instead of absconding any responsibility."
"&gt; He's going on and on to my family on how a mans shirt on a woman is like a flag of victory that you had sex with her.


Damn, where are all my freaking shirts then."
"Good for you, OP. I know you're hurting and it'll take a while to get over it, but I promise you that you'll start feeling better about life and yourself very soon. You've done what a lot of people lack the strength or conviction to do, which is escaping an abusive partner. I hope in the future you find a wonderful guy who makes you feel fantastic!"
"I really think you need to get in contact with the bartender. You haven't done anything wrong, other than possibly date a jerk. Hell, you were trying to remedy the situation without causing problems. 

Also, if I were you, I'd dump your BF. His actions could lose you your job, and the fact that he acted the way he did is a red flag. "
You were on your property in a conversation with your husband. You have nothing to be sorry for.
"Wow, that's some astonishingly bad advice from your mother. No, you don't need to just accept comments from your boyfriend about having a weird vagina. How is your relationship with your mom? I'd venture a guess she's kinda shitty in general, right? No good mom is gonna tell their daughter to put up with her boyfriend being mean to her.

Find someone who loves you and is nice to you and your nonweird vagina, please. There are literally millions of guys out there who would never say this kind of stuff to you."
"Good luck with the new job, but I would doubt the current employees telling you the 100 hour weeks are that rare. "
"She hasn't even agreed to date you. You could quit your job and she says ""nope"". I think you need to talk to her before making such a grand gesture. "
"Yes. When he left he spent a couple of hours berating me for not trusting him. I was such a horrible person for not trusting him. I broke him down as a person because I could never quite trust him enough. The reason I couldn't trust him is because he was constantly cheating and my gut was telling me that. I wanted to trust him so much that I looked past red flag after red flag. I was completely stupid in my relationship with him but the good thing is I only have one month until my divorce is final. Right now I never want to date again, I'm so exhausted from the four years I wasted on him. If I do ever date again though I would never look past these things again. I'm running if I see red flags. "
"I think if you love each other and want to be together - get married. You both are old enough to make that choice and her sitting at home being guilted won't help anything. 

I hate when people say you are tying yourself down, marrying too young etc etc. Heck - you are marrying your best friend and soon to be mother of your baby - you can grow and enjoy life together. 

I was in the same position as you- we married and will be celebrating our 20th anniversary soon. Congrats on the baby - you are old enough to make these choices and be confident in them. "
"Yeah I feel like this is pretty important. Everyone is saying ""shower him with unbridled adoration!!"" But some men truly would get overwhelmed with that. The best way to know is to gauge his reaction from the first two"
"Further to that, he did an EXCEPTIONAL job of lying to her for however long it took him to figure out that he wasn't feeling ""foreverness"".  At least if he had been honest about his reservations or feelings throughout, she would have had SOME indication that maybe things were not as ideal as she thought.  What a fucking coward.  

Sorry OP, I know this came out of nowhere for you.  You *will* find someone who can be honest about how he feels before he lets the relationship get as far as this one did."
"I'm going to hazard a bet, that as you look over other aspects of your 'friendship', you're going to find that he was selfish in other ways too, but it was stuff that got overlooked or that didn't seem as serious."
I had the same problem! I never realized how disfunctional my childhood upbringing was until it gets rubbed in my face and I realize I kinda got robbed of a normal happy childhood. It's normal to be mad about it but you have to process it and learn to accept that you can't really do anything about it

"As a woman who is keenly tuned in to the various subtle ways women sometimes undermine each other...your wife is 100% being paranoid. And it's almost certainly coming from a place of jealous insecurity. 

It sounds like there's *nothing* your sister could do that wouldn't be interpreted as a veiled insult by your wife. Sends her a birthday card? ""She just wants to point out that I'm not getting any younger!"" Bakes some cookies for you? ""She's telling me I'm a bad wife for not baking for my husband more!"" Goes on a trip and posts pictures on Facebook? ""She's trying to say I'm not adventurous enough!!""

"He may already know from googling your name. 

You need to just need tell him and lay it all out for him. If he judges you wrongly based on it then it says more about him than it does you. Explain why you didn't tell him sooner. If he loves you then he will accept your past. Hope it goes well for you!  "

Yes. This.this so much this. There is no coming back from the damage you could cause by coming clean. You can even ease out of it. Start by not finishing every single time. Do you enjoy sex though? Thats what i told my bf that it feels good im enjoying myself i just cant have and irgasm from PIV sex. Figure out ways you can l work together.  It could be you or him touching you during sex or even using vibrators
I think the real problem here is that you seem to treat your older son better than your younger son because your older son is more athletic.
I saw the winky face and thought the same thing. There would be no winky face if he wasn't into her.  
"Well, no, it wasn't the only reason. The other reason is Laura told him she approved of you. :/

I am with you. I think your mom is really off with her advice. His boundaries with Laura are non-existent, and you aren't going to have a real marriage with him. She's his real life partner. You're just there to the extent she lets you be there."
"So your boyfriend associates alcohol with promiscuity because *he* used to get drunk and sleep around, and he's projecting that onto you.

Nah. Put your foot down. You're allowed to go out drinking with your friends without being punished for it after the fact. If he can't tolerate being someone who drinks in moderation on special occasions, maybe he should find a new girlfriend."

"Look man, it sounds like he is hanging the promise of a proposal over your head by teasing and hinting at it, without giving you a straight-up honest answer about whether or not he sees an engagement in your future. This is creating a huge imbalance in your relationship - he's the one that is holding all the cards, while you just sit there passively waiting for him to propose. This is NOT the way a future husband should treat you, it is disrespectful, rude, and to be honest, a little bit malicious.

Tell him straight up - ""I need to know that we have the same goals and the same plan for our future. I want to marry you, but I need to know sooner rather than later if you feel the same way about me, because otherwise this relationship is no longer providing what I need from a life partner. I don't appreciate how you have treated this so flippantly, and are stringing me along.""

You also have to be prepared to end the relationship if he does not propose. Generally ultimatums are not advisable in romantic relationships, but when it comes to being on the same page with marriage, it is kind of a non-negotiable. If he isn't ready to marry you, even though he knows you want to get married, then it's time to shit or get off the pot."
"hopefully, he just thinks if he says this it will prevent you from cheating and doesn't have any real intentions to do so...

don't wait around for him to find random things to get suspicious about.

Not every frat is straight out of an after-school special. However, it sounds like alcohol has already been a factor, which bothers you. And it's okay if it does-you're not required to be a ""cool girlfriend"" and roll with it.

But he IS allowed to make his own decisions. If he would rather be a part of the frat and/or enjoy partying, he is making his own choice. You just have to figure out if those choices are a deal breaker for you."
"Yep, probably a misogynist then, given the way he treats your mother and the difference between how he treated you and your brother. I'd keep pushing your mom to speak with her mother about it. She should probably divorce, or at the very least get counseling (though to be honest your father doesn't sound like the kind of guy that would go for that since he doesn't even think there's an issue), but I'm not going to advice someone tell their mother to divorce their father, because that'll probably just exacerbate the situation."
"This man sounds like an emotional abuser. He is trying to make you question your perception of reality and playing the ""poor me"" card when you bring up legitimate concerns or questions.

"Just to provide you another perspective, wearing the wrong kinda of underwear (not breathable fabrics that are absorbent) is bad for a ladies vagina. Unfortunately, most underwear sold in the mass market falls under the ""wrong kinda"" underwear for lady parts. I suffered from bacterial infections for years (Bacterial Vaginosis for those who are curious) and my gyno told me just to stop wearing underwear all together or to buy brands like THINX. Considering the cost of THINX I just started to go commando. Within 3 months of airing out down under (Not sleeping with underwear. I would wear underwear during the day) my lady parts problem stopped. Wearing underwear is simply a societal construct and actually damages women's vaginal health in certain cases. If you are curious, google the topic. There are many experts who have all come to this conclusion. I'm not trying to say you are not allowed to have you preferences but realize for some people it's a matter of health. "

"It doesn't at all sound like you're on the marriage track. 

 Your boyfriend's personal assistant is completely unprofessional and he's done absolutely nothing to rein her in. He should have nipped this in the bud, but he hasn't. He allows this inappropriate behavior and she's absolutely running with it. 

Commitment and trust issues stem from work stress? From an outsider's prospective, it sounds like he enjoys sleeping with you frequently but is perfectly fine with keeping you at arms' length and to let his EMPLOYEE run interference. 

Have you ever talked to him about how his PA is overstepping her boundaries? If he meets your (valid, oh so valid) concerns with dismissiveness (""oh that's just how she is!""), perhaps that's the wake up call you'll need. If he has a complete ahha! moment and realizes that he needs to lay down boundaries or find a new PA because his relationship matters more to him than an employee running amok, then you have a shot. Otherwise, it's not likely he'll marry you. She's making sure of it."

"**GET POLICE TO ESCORT YOU WHEN YOU ARE LEAVING. Even if you think he won't be there.** OP, therapists don't say that unless they are *sure* that it's true. You know he is abusing you. Everything you have listed is abusive. Your life is in danger.

First, you need help. Contact the women's shelter, free legal aid - you need legal and police advice and assistance. Go to thehotline.com, research organisations for victims of abuse - do this from a public library or using incognito mode, so he won't find out.

He took your food stamps under duress and threats - you did not let him use them. I'm not from the States, but you need free/low-cost legal advice (maybe look this up online) to find out *if* this is something you really need to be afraid of. You are understandably paranoid after a lifetime of abuse. But you can't let food stamps endanger your life. [Someone suggested reporting them missing, which could be a good idea.]

**As for his daughter: if you are dead, you won't be able to have a relationship with her.** There is no reason why you couldn't find a safe way to leave her a note before you leave, or just call her from a pay phone. If he is violent around her, you could contact CPS, and perhaps once you're set up with a job, you may be able to foster her.

You don't need his mother to be there - you need the police to be there when you leave. 

If you know he's keeping the title of the car away from you intentionally, you **know** you can't have a normal conversation asking him to sign it over to you. Ask thehotline.com or the woman's shelter if they have suggestions - and ask the police, as well. No harm in calling them and explaining your situation, and asking about the car. The only other move here is to tell his aunt that he insisted putting it in his name, and asking *her* to tell him to put it in your name for some made-up reason - but you know this is risky, and the car is NOT worth your life.

With your temporary disability, you should be eligible for financial support from the government. 

OP, I've been in a similar situation to yours (although not anywhere near as bad). I know that it's a horrible decision to make, and you feel like you are losing everything. But if you stay, you are losing your life in every sense.

Leave as soon as possible, and as carefully as possible - no precaution is going to be too much."
"&gt;so she says it would really suck to go on her own.

So it's not like this is a great opportunity to meet all of her favorite people in the family. It's weird to me that she thinks you are being unreasonable when her ""reason"" for not just going herself is ""it would suck"" to just hang out with her parents. You have concrete reasons that are eminently sensible. 

To answer your initial question: you are being quite reasonable.

The real question is how you get her to see that and not pout when you don't go. Perhaps if you guys wrote down a pros/cons list for going as a couple vs her going alone?"
"Ok, wow.  That was hard to read, because I feel terrible for you, and for your son.  

Divorce her.  There is NOTHING to be gained by staying in this marriage.  Get 50/50 custody of your son, so he has a normal life when he lives with you.   You may have to pay her alimony if she doesn't work, but at the very least you will be a) able to protect your son from his mother when he is with you and b) you're doing all the work of running a house-hold anyway, at least this way you won't have to pick up after her and all the pets she insists on having.  

I know if feels like you ""can't"" leave.  But you can.  And you should.  Fight HARD for as much custody of your son as you can get, because you LITERALLY have no other option at this point for him having any chance at a normal life.  If you don't do it for you, do it for him.  After everything you just mentioned here...divorce is your best and only solution.   "
I've told her this and she just ignores me.
"&gt; I agree with this. As a woman

Chiming in as a man - women are able to get a lot more attached to their child before birth. My kids are 6 and 8 now and I love them to death.

But day 1?  I did love them, but I didn't *know* them.  My wife had these kids flopping and kicking in her for months now.  There's an innate closeness in that experience.  I'd held them for 10 mins - I felt love and affection (and there was a certain amount of ""I should feel this, so i'm going to reflect that""), but there is a definite catch up period for men.  "
"&gt; Just because your dad is looking for a new partner, doesn't mean you're looking for a new mom.

Bingo! She's under no obligation to let a stranger help plan her baby shower. That struck me as especially ridiculous. 

If they form a relationship over time, that's one thing, but it has to happen as two adults who meet each other as strangers and get to know each other gradually over many meetings. Of course OP is having trouble adjusting, her dad is throwing her under the bus here. A more normal approach would be to introduce them over a lunch or dinner and have the gf attend events as a date."
"Given what  you're looking for, I think you may be setting yourself up for disappointment. I think your chances of getting married to this guy and everything being a fun, monogamous relationship on this tour are both extremely low. 

I think it comes down to whether he is looking for a relationship (you need to ask now), or if you're okay for a few months of just fun with this guy and this tour. "
"Seriously, if he was able to support himself then what was the issue? It would be different if he was reckless with spending or constantly borrowing money or something, but no. How could she let someone convince her to leave the man she apparently loved over money? That's so shallow and I can completely understand why the dude feels hurt and betrayed. "
"I think you should lose the weight and then see where the relationship is at, BEFORE getting married."
"My dad is very similar, but we have not lived together for about 20 years at this point so I'm not as directly impacted by his actions and I have learned to adjust my expectations. I tried for a really long time to make him proud but the things that I expect will make him proud are usually met with a bland response. 

I think the bottom line is, don't try to make your dad proud. Make yourself proud. Your accomplishments should be for yourself, and no one else. Your dad is probably incredibly proud of you, you sound like a smart young woman who has a good head on your shoulders, but he probably can't relate to you in terms of the types of things you're accomplishing right now (I'm guessing he's a good 30+ years from having completed any coursework, or gotten his drivers license, so he probably doesn't consider these to be big milestone achievements anymore). His reactions don't mean he loves you any less than a dad who would react more openly and affectionately. "
"Thanks. I hope it was short term. I feel regret for deleting and that's how I know I did the right thing though. I am not a cheater. Even though nothing happened, too many emotions are getting involved (from me)."
"I know right?! Yes, pepper spray is definitely on the to-do list. It's nice to know that we aren't overreacting, because sometimes I feel bad, like he probably means well but is just being very inappropriate about it."
"&gt;He brushes me off when I try to talk to him about things that are important to me. Which makes the smallest, most seemingly insignificant thing multiply as I get more and more frustrated. And so I feel like if I mention this latest ""gym crush"" meme, he'll get annoyed and refuse to talk about it because it's ""stupid and unnecessary""

&gt;I'm tempted to just throw in the towel. I'm tired of second guessing everything D says to me. Would it be wrong of me to just not talk to him ever again? He's ignoring me, so we can't talk like adults. He's avoiding me, so there's no communication. If I'm going to break up with him, I want to do it properly. Not via text, because I do love him, and that's not the kind of person I am.

The guy's completely ignoring you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but it sounds like you're already broken up. Communication has broken down completely. I don't think you win any ""being the better person,"" points here by pretending there's still anything there. Send him one last break up message, put his shit on the curb, and be done with it. 

You deserve WAY better. Not someone who refuses to talk to you and is fucking around at the gym (which, by the way, he totally is. They're both essentially flaunting it in your face.) 

Please, save whatever self respect you have and don't go chasing and pining after some guy who won't even talk to you. I'm really sorry to say this but it's pathetic. Rise above his shit and get rid of him."
"On the upside it helps your case with the owner. But really, that was the right choice.

"Almost sounds like she is asking permission to have a crush on your husband in a round about way. Like, if you let it slide and continue to hang out the three of you, she will feel comfortable to flirt or try for his affection. I think you know not to worry because your husband loves you and is faithful, but I agree with your mom she is not someone you can trust. And like another redditr mentioned, if it was so small and innocent she probably would have just kept it to herself, she sounds sort of dangerous, distructive. 

Bummer to lose a friend for sure! I think pushing back a little, giving it some time, will at least put some boundaries up and give her time to reflect. Everything should become transparent then."
From the tangled mess you've described here I think you need a lawyer more than you need this sub. 
"Aside from this being an issue that got blown out of proportion...

If your partner needs some time to cool off before discussing an issue, I think it's fine for the partner to be like, ""Hey, I'm too emotional / frustrated / mad to discuss this rationally right now, so I need some time to myself."" But to just give you the silent treatment as a form of punishment or as a means to put the onus on you to resolve the fight is not healthy. If this is something he does habitually, I would bring it up after the fight is over &amp; see if he's open to working on it. "
"Did you boss seriously ""scold"" and ""yell"" at you over trying to resolve a problem yourself instead of escalating to management? That sounds bonkers. Even if you had ""gone off"" on this dude in front of everyone, that wouldn't be appropriate. 

I would: explain your side of the story (you asked because you thought you had a good relationship and thought it could be resolved between you), see what he says, and then do your best to make nice because it's a professional environment. You don't need to be friends, but you do need to be cordial. I would also start looking for another job.

"I'm actually split on this myself! On one hand it is their own goddamn home; on the other hand, I would hate to be woken up every night because of the paper-thin walls, especially as I do have to wake up at buttfuck o'clock to get to work on time. 

My boyfriend and I stayed in a cabin/lake house with friends this summer and it was so poorly insulated that we could literally have conversations with our friends through the floor/ceiling and walls, *in a normal indoor speaking volume*. Not yelling. Just talking. Which was awkward and funny for a long weekend, but I can't imagine *living* in that situation, every day. It would drive me up the wall!

At the same time, they're doing normal adult stuff in the privacy of their own home and it's just ludicrous to expect them to change their private habits for the sake of their neighbors. I can't imagine I would react well if my neighbors began trying to dictate how I should live my life within the confines of my own home (obviously assuming I'm not being actively raucous and discourteous).

I've lived with horrible noisy roommates and I know the frustration of it. At the same time, I keep thinking of this friend I have who has moved apartments three times in the last three years, at least partially because of ""noisy neighbors who stomp around upstairs"". But I kind of feel like that comes with the territory of living beneath somebody, and I also start to wonder if she's just overly sensitive and hyperbolic about the sound of people (especially children - she always points out there are toddlers scrambling about) *existing*.

I have no advice for OP because I see both sides of it and I can't decide which wins out!"
This. You can't control your Sister or her actions but you can empower your Daughter which is of far greater benefit than chasing an apology from someone who is clueless &amp; insincere! 
Thank you for your comment it really opened my eyes. He said he deserved what happened because he put himself in that situation and your comment helped me realize I needed to let him know he didn't deserve that and while I'm upset at him about the drinking that's not more important than how he feels after having something really scary happen to him and we can deal with the two things seperatly 
"He married you when you were twenty. Did you look younger than your age then?

Your husband is creepy af. "
Like I can't believe OP and her boyfriend aren't more pissed off about that and sex with him isn't firmly off the table...
It's interesting that the first thing you described her as is soft-spoken when you list her attractive attributes. I think attractive quiet girls fall victim to men painting pictures in their heads where they fill in the blanks with an idealized version. She made you feel more masculine. Another girl asking you out cannot recreate that. 
"This wasn't petty.  

The owner doesn't want his customers mistreated by other customers.  It's hard enough to deliver great service, and great food, and drinks along with a great experience, but if people like the OP's friends are acting rude and mistreating the other customers it will ruin someone else's experience quickly and the reputation of the establishment.  

What the OPs group did with the first chair was unnecessaryand rude, what they did with the 2nd chair was designed to intimidate the guy drinking water.   Overall their behavior was calculated, rude, and completely unnecessary, but since the OP's group know T, they felt entitled, and since they were entitled they felt they  could do whatever they wanted to do, and do it to anyone in the restaurant.   

I think the owner of any successful restaurant would do the same thing.    The owner saw them for what they were, entitled jerks and eliminated a problem from his establishment.  At minimum T receives a strong warning, and worst case scenario T joins his friends and is banned.  "
Your dad thinks of you as his property. Gross.
"No one does. Then they do.

That poor girl. She has no concept of the world. It's not so much funny as scary and kind of abusive. 
"Eh, this guy sounds overly dramatic.  A guy with ""so many"" crazy exes is the crazy one himself, usually.  He probably has a certain charisma, and his craziness may not show up until later, so it's up to you if you want to take the chance of getting drawn into his sphere."
"&gt;Where do you arrive at the conclusion that she needs therapy?

WHAT? How do you *not* see that she needs therapy? She has completely normalized their behavior and if you hadn't encouraged her she would never have pressed charges. 

Her father warned her that the brother would *kill her* and instead of trying to protect her he told her off for trying to ~tear the family apart~. Despite all that she still lives with them and wants to pretend everything is getting better! Cutting off your family can be hard, I get that, but her parents are abusive and clearly care more about enabling the psycho brother.

She needs serious therapy, and desperately needs to go no-contact with family until they stop enabling her psycho brother (which will probably never happen)."
"You've had plenty good advice here, but given a few clues in your post that imply you're from the uk I thought I'd offer some advice from someone who did the grad scheme thing. 

I'd like to point out that graduate training schemes (in the Big 4, anyway) typically have intakes in September and January, and sometimes in April. There's zero concern in applying for an intake date later than your degree. In fact, most grad schemes (both in and outside of the big 4) really approve of this - if you look at the application info, most will involve some sort of one on one interview at one point where you describe the skills you've honed etc.. Having real world retail experience is actually FANTASTIC for material you can use to answer their questions: when did you work in a team, describe a time when your integrity has been tested, what's your most challenging experience, etc.. 

Finally, a word of caution. It sounds like your mum is very eager for you to enter into grad scheme utopia: are you certain that this is also your path? I can't speak for some grad schemes, but I did do the scheme at one of the Big Four and--well, I don't do that any more (I can go into more detail on my issues with my time there if you like). My parents were very eager for me to be successful in their terms, and it took me a degree I wasn't keen on and three years of grad scheme purgatory before I realised that I had to live my life for myself. If you're sure this is something you'd like, or at least like to try, then fair play to you. Good luck. Some of my friends are thriving in grad schemes. But if there's something else you'd always kind of hoped you'd be or achieve, I'd really encourage you to plot towards that goal instead. Yes, the earning potential for grad schemes is pretty high a few years down the road: but be prepared that it might not be worth the social or emotional cost of very heavy work weeks plus very heavy studying, especially if you don't see yourself staying there super long term. 

My grad scheme experience was this: I made plenty of really good friends, but the work week was extremely busy and could be full of unpaid overtime/weekend work, plus hours and hours of studying. I was in a very high performing team, so we played hard too (think weekly Thursday drinks from 5-6pm until 3am, and most often Friday drinks until the same time, coupled with boozy project completion drinks in the middle of the day) and frankly a considerable % of the high fliers were functional alcoholics. It leaves very little room for you as a person; I felt pretty scooped out by the job, and if you live in an expensive city you may find it harder to save money than you thought. "
"&gt;  is she taking her friend to show that she is not interested in a relationship, does she say her friend is coming and hope I will cancel for that reason?

I mean, we can't answer this for you for certain but it surely seems like it. I think she likes your company and attention that you provide but for whatever reason doesn't see you as compatible in the long-run. She also possibly may have found someone else she is interested in now which is why the abrupt change happened even though you all planned it together, or simply she lost that lustful spark again just like in the first time. 

Unfortunately I don't see you having a future with this girl past FWBs based on the information you provided. "

Supposedly it was because we would need to move for all of us to live together, and she didn't want us uprooted while we were in school (I'm older, so I would graduate first). Personally I have a sneaking suspicion that her remarrying would have affected her child-support payments, and she didn't want to miss out on any of them.

Either way, they seemed perfectly happy for MANY years, but when my sister finally graduated, instead of getting married and living happily ever after they broke up. Not to say that this is what will happen in your situation, just that I've seen an arrangement like this before and it didn't work out they way they planned.

As for your situation, it seems in large part that you are driven by what your kid wants. While that is admirable, a 6-year-old wanting a stepdad is not really a good reason to push forward in blending your families. It's unfortunate that he's sad about the status quo, but if he was sad because he wanted a brother or sister, or a dog, or a pony, or a go-cart, would you feel obligated to get it for him? I should hope not. Your relationship with your BF is between you and him. You should not be asking him to make promises to the kid or move the relationship along to pacify the kid.

"
"Acceptance of it is hard :(
My roommates parents came to visit him onetime during uni and they were so warm and caring, asking about his life and studies, how he was dealing with everything and just being supportive. They were like a shoulder to lean on for him. Of course he couldn't wait for them to leave and stop bugging him, but i told him how amazing his parents were and he shrugged it off saying that's just parents being parents. "
"This kinda smells like BPD to me. She doesn't seem to have a stable internal identity and everyone in her life is either the most amazing person ever or literally the devil depending on what time of day it is. Could be 100% wrong, either way she desperately needs professional help. 

And you have enough to worry about without walking on eggshells around her. Transitioning is hard, even with a supportive family. Put some distance between you and your cousin and focus on your own life for now. It's up to her to get the help she needs. "
"Yes, OP, call CPS for the poor little girl and absolutely keep the dog. Don't even consider giving her that dog for another second. "
"Ah. Well I was raised Catholic and I'm familiar with the attitudes towards sex, particularly female sexuality. So I feel a little sorry for your gf if she is struggling with that. But at the end of the day, she is 25, she is a grown-up and she's made her decision about how she wants to conduct her personal life. You can challenge her on her over-involvement in *your* dating life but in terms of her own sexuality you kind of have to take her at her word about what she wants."
"I think you should at least try and compose yourself before he gets home. I mean, tell him you missed him but definitely don't tell him you were sobbing all day over it. I think you should probably shield him from that knowledge as it's pretty disturbing for a kid to hear."
"Thank you to you and everyone else who is giving advice on this. Based on everyone's responses I will tell him about the email. I guess I don't know what the ""right"" thing to do is for him as well. I'm also just worried that she will persist sometime down the line and I do wonder if it's worth getting into a relationship with her looming around. 

I have a friend (I use the term friend loosely) who basically has done the same thing to one of her ex-boyfriends and even though she has gotten help (turns out she was bipolar - so she finally started getting help after being sent to a ward during a manic episode), there have been a few times even after she got help where she would go off medication for whatever reason and then harass her ex and his gf.

I know it's unreasonable to think but I don't like the idea of someone out there in the world hating or disliking me, even if it's a crazy ex gf. "
"What on earth can he possibly do to rebuild trust after secretly having children with someone else? It sucks, but clearly this man is not your best friend and is not putting you first in his life. Take a cue from him and put yourself and your children first until he can prove he can be trusted, which will take time and action, not wordsmith and promises. "
"Engaged yet haven't actually talked about what they expect in the future, or hell, how many kids they even want to have! Red flags all around"
"&gt; Self-awareness is worthless if it doesn't keep you from making bad decisions.

Saved. This is a really good quote."
"Agreed. ""Better safe, than sorry"", right?"
"If he was trying to hang up the photo on the wall with your other photos, or using the stuffed animal as a dining table centerpiece, I'd be with you on this one. But you're telling him he can't have random stuff in a box that's stashed away? You're aware that he lives there too right? You really can't just sanitize the parts of his past that you don't like. Is he still hung up on her? Sounds like it. Address that instead of trying to be controlling about what stuff he's  ""allowed"" to have stored in your shared living space."
"Yeah this seems like the most obvious answer. They ""got together"" so quickly after the break-up because they were already together. The girlfriend knew OP's social media and had been stalking it because she was the other woman and was curious. 

It also explains why she's so hell-bent on cutting OP out now: she's worried about him cheating on her like he did with her."
"On our way to the ER. Blood is just streaming out and my lower abdomen feels like I'm being stabbed. I woke up my dad and Kelly and they instantly freaked out because I look really

"This is essentially what I was going to write. It's bad enough he bailed on her, but it's like- WTF that he'd call and brag about his evening."
"&gt;Claire is a vain idiot who is using your daughter as a prop for her social media personality.

For sure. Especially with what OP added about Claire trying to convince the daughter to get a matching teal streak in her hair. It screams ""looking for Instagram likes."" "
No shit. It's like borrowing someones car and expecting THEM to fill it up with fuel for your use. So rude!
"""Hey wife, I'm afraid I'm not very good at this family research stuff. I've been trying to figure out what I did wrong, but I need your help. Here's what I found so far and it's really difficult for me to believe that I got it correct."" "
"I would try and get this prioritised. You were lucky you had someone to come and 'save' you as such, next time it could be a single female with no one to contact in an emergency with a much worse outcome. "
"A grown woman saying that an 11 year old child needs to ""get it together and take responsibility"" when he's missing his father is so wrong. Stop choosing your manipulative, immature partner over your own damn son. "
But do you feel it was cheating?
"Yeah, ffs, there's nothing wrong with having a high sex drive but I don't see why it *always* needs to be OP taking care of it. 

Sex a few times per week and masturbation at other times is a reasonable compromise."
"man i'd get out of my bed at 4am for almost anyone in my life that needs help.

"They know they can practice with water, right? 

That's one of the ways competitive eaters do it, they chug a gallon of water to help the stomach stretch. 

Yeah, alcohol tolerance plays a part too, but they could practice every night with water and do ""live fire"" on the weekends."
"You don't need to take a big trip alone. Maybe just go hiking on Sundays by yourself, or buy some camping gear and spend a weekend away in the closest park. That can be a good start to relieving the feeling of suffocation you seem to be feeling."
"Help yourself, then you can help others. You have to get yourself stable first, that's most important. 
"
"It all comes back around to acceptance. Her mother likely has some sort of feelings of personal shame regarding sexuality, and so she can't healthily accept her daughter as a sexual being either.

I was raised very religious, and have similar struggles. My parents tend to escalate situations involving my love life to dramatic levels just because deep down they're horrifically uncomfortable with the carnal knowledge that I'm definitely having sex with my boyfriends.

In fact, after my most recent breakup, the first words out of my dad's mouth were ""well at least you didn't *commit to him physically*.""

He was probably fishing. I'm in my twenties dad. I definitely did sleep with my boyfriend. It's not a big deal to most, but to them it's *literally* the biggest point of it all. It's incredibly difficult to get close to family once your ""moral compasses"" start pointing in different directions."
"Live your life for yourself, not your parents. "
"1. This incident was recent, there's no reason for it to just blow over the way you are expecting. I don't know what exactly your friend is doing to deal with their addiction but it's not unreasonable to expect some distance at this point because YOU ended up on cocaine with her. Especially since this happened after the Drinking and Driving incident (I'm operating under the assumption that that's a different friend), you have now in recent memory shown at least two very serious moments of immaturity, recklessness, and lack of respect. From his POV, why should he trust you or these friends? What are you doing to address the situation other than say it's being handled and eventually getting into another shitty situation that could've been avoided?

2. This is more of a 50/50 issue. I look at it this way: the point of social media is to share things that you think people find interesting or for attention. There's no other way around it, what you put on your social media is what you think people are interested in, or how you decided to get that attention. I post pictures of food, most people post what they're doing that day, some people post about their kids, some people post about their bodies, lifestyles, etc. I don't know what your instagram is like but if it's ""somewhat sexy pics"" and ""partying and drinking"", why is that the image you wish to promote of yourself (I'm guessing you have other pictures aside from those on your ig? idk your comment doesn't seem to imply that though)? I don't think it's right to force you to delete it, that IS controlling. At the same time are you looking for any alternative solutions aside from ""fuck you I do what I want""...which is immature. Maybe you can private it, so people stop posting unsolicited comments. Maybe you can lessen some of the more outrageous pictures on your instagram. 

3. You don't seem to grasp how serious and selfish what you did was. There's no ""being too hard on you"" with this. There's no excuse for both of you getting into a car when the driver was drunk, yes it happened a year ago but like I said at #1...what steps have you made to indicate you've matured?

This may sound really harsh but I'm just trying to paint things from the POV of your husband, and I think the issues you're having are deeper than just ""he hates your friends"". He hates the fact that you do stupid, dangerous things with these friends and don't think of their impact on other people -- i m m a t u r i t y. And you're not really acknowledging or making identifiable, quantifiable steps to correct these things. Your response is ""well it happened, stop dwelling"". And maybe for a different man that is acceptable, but not for your husband. 

None of this is really advice except you guys need to communicate a lot better, and need to react more maturely than just orders and ""get over it""s."
"He crossed a line, absolutely and without question. But it may not be something he understands about himself, it may not be that he cried for sympathy or anything like that. A strong sexual compulsion at that age is incredibly embarrassing, which is then compounded if anyone finds out.

It would be acceptable to ban him from your home, as he has proven that he cannot behave appropriately there. But you should also encourage him to seek counseling from a non-faith based source. If he's already unable to control himself then it's likely to continue and possibly escalate until he actually finds a method to reassert that control he's lost. Counseling could help him with that, if it's good counseling."
"Listen to me OP. Listen. *LISTEN*.

ANYBODY WHO CHEATS ON THEIR FUCKING WEDDING NIGHT AIN'T WORTH SHIT, AINT NEVER BEEN WORTH SHIT, WILL NEVER BE WORTH SHIT. Do a full 180 and leave. This...person...is 1000% not worth your time/emotions/energy/breath. There is nothing there for you, AT ALL. She is not your best friend. You thought she was, however, you thought **wrong**. Leave now. You should have left her that night, but there is still time. Its only been a month."
"So, my story is very much like Elsie's. I was a bit overweight in my teens and proceeded to put on the freshman, sophomore, junior *and* senior 10 during college. Got married at 21, approximately 70 pounds over my ideal weight. When I was 22, I went to a doctor to discuss pregnancy planning issues. That doctor looked at me in disgust and said, ""I cannot advise you to get pregnant while you are so grossly overweight."" Now, I never went back to that ~~asshole~~ doctor who meant well, but whose delivery left *much* to be desired, but it did get me thinking. So, I spent the next year being a faithful Weight Watcher and lost that 70 pounds.

And, my whole world changed, especially my self-confidence. One unintended consequence was that the more weight I lost, the angrier I got. I got myself into therapy after becoming scared when I found myself literally wanting to murder people for walking too slowly in front of me, as I made my daily walk from my office to the train station. Turns out, that weight had been acting as a shield/mask against the world. And, once gone, I was left with no defenses and had to actually deal with my issues. 

Whether she realizes it or not, losing that amount of weight is sure to have an affect on Elsie's relationship with herself and the rest of the world. I cannot recommend highly enough that she explore that changed relationship with a therapist, with an eye toward striving for balance. 

If your experience is anything like mine - and it's absolutely possible that it will not be - your relationship with her will never be quite the same, because *she* will never be the same. As painful as it was, I ended up divorcing my husband. I also spent the years between 23 and 26 really getting to know and enjoy myself, before committing to a marriage and having children. 

So, my advice to you? Accept that the old Elsie is indeed gone. Support her in discovering - in a healthy way - who the new Elsie is. It's possible that she has swapped eating for going overboard on creating a new shield. Realize that you ultimately have no control over any of this and take the opportunity to be true to yourself as well - that's really the only control any of us ever has anyway.

*Edited to soften the description of the doctor. Yes, he was only trying to help - and he ultimately succeeded! Yay! However, there were definitely other, kinder, more professional ways he could have delivered his message that didn't involve outright fat-shaming."
"&gt; Knowing her, she probably either had to go to the bathroom or just wanted to avoid conflict, or a combination of both.

:( You're not getting it. Locking your self in the bathroom is a classic response to physical abuse."
"He didn't respect you before the marriage, and he's not respecting you now. When will you draw the line?"
good job on the reply! if you think he's going to keep reaching out I'd block him. 
"Just tell him the truth. It's her wedding, and none of you can control what happened in high school. If he's mature, he won't throw a fit about it, he'll be understanding. You go to the wedding, he stays home, no drama."
"&gt;my vagina looking 'weird'

Dump him right now. 

This guy is verbally abusive. Your mom is wrong. You're putting up with stuff you should never let slide."
"I really like her. She taught me how to do really natural makeup, buys me books to read, told my dad to get me a dog (which he did) and always introduces me as ""the best 1/2 of a package deal ever, my bonus child!"" And she is learning French to help me with my French class "
[deleted]
"Ask him to listen to you and let you finish. ""Hey, I know that it's rough adjusting back. Prison was a terrible place. I know that you said that you aren't interested in therapy. However, our daughter mentioned the other day that she saw you sitting in one place for five hours. If you won't do it for yourself or even for me, your daughter needs you to go to therapy. It is not showing weakness, it is accepting necessary help. It is hurting your daughter and me to see you like this. We love you."""
"&gt;1) Am I totally overreacting?

I don't think so.  The terms were clear, and she broke them.  

&gt;2) How do I bring this up without sounding like a total judgey asshole?

I think the direct approach is best.  ""We agreed that you would not have any unfamiliar guests, and waking up to see you and someone sleeping on the living room couch is not acceptable.  It is not to happen again, or we can't have you staying here.""  "
"Stop being friends with him. Imagine if it were just the two of you. You said no, he doesn't care. Creepy and possibly dangerous. Nope."
"NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, DO NOT GET MARRIED TO HIM UNTIL YOU HAVE THIS DISCUSSION.

It's an incompatibility that MUST be addressed prior to marriage. It's NOT SOMETHING you can compromise on, you can't just have half a kid, after all..."
"I just want to say that I'm proud of you for recognizing that your current lifestyle is dangerous and that you want to change.  

You don't need your husband's approval to change.  Start with changing yourself.  Start by seeing your doctor for help.  Quitting your addictions can be dangerous and you really should loop a medical professional in.  You need to focus on yourself now, before you can focus on your husband's issues.  Good luck.  "
"Sounds like she has a completely valid reason for choosing her step father over you. Ultimately all you can do is understand and try to learn from what she told you. Clearly she's still hurt from it at least a little bit, so maybe you need to work on having a better relationship with your daughter and having less of a controlling wife. Kids should come first."
She's an asshole. Best friends are supposed to support you emotionally and be happy for you. 
"So you get angrier than you used to and your sex drive is changed. Is your IUD hormonal? There's definitely plenty of anecdotal evidence that hormonal changes can cause personality changes, and that mixture may be affecting how you feel about your boyfriend. 'I don't know why I'm feeling this way' is a dead ringer for something being wrong.

I recognize the process was complicated to get your IUD, but if it's affecting your relationship/psychology then you need to do something about it. You shouldn't be getting into a blind rage over sex."
"You sound like a nice guy. But, and I say this with kindness, there is a difference between being easy going and being a push over. 

According to Google's dictionary:

**Easy Going**
relaxed and tolerant in approach or manner.

**Pushover**
a person who is easy to overcome or influence.

You can be a nice easy going guy, relaxed and tolerant, without caving to every unreasonable demand made of you. An easy going guy would accept that his girlfriend doesn't like his friend x since she dislikes smoking and wouldn't force her to hang out with x or hassle her about not liking him. A pushover would let his girlfriend ban him from hanging out with his friend since she is afraid he'll be influenced to vape. An easy going guy would be accepting of his girlfriend not like instagram due to all the hot girl selfies and be cool with her not following him. A pushover would let her ban him from instagram. An easy going guy would be not recommend app games to his girlfriend since he knows she finds in app purchases too tempting. A pushover would let his girlfriend ban him from using apps since she fears he will make purchases.

Do you see what I'm getting at? Saying no is a super important and basic life skill. Letting people force you into doing whatever they want isn't part of being a nice or easy going person. In fact it's dangerous and people who have a hard time saying no are more likely to do bad things since they are more vulnerable to social pressure and authority. "
Agreed. She also boldfaced lied to OP about there being someone else so I really wouldn't give her the time of day any longer.
"You said:
&gt; How can I get her to see it will be better for her if she forgives him?

You're basically saying you want her to ""get over it"" because you weren't as hurt from it as she was. Correct? That attitude has no place in a marriage.

I am wondering if you think he is worth breaking your engagement for because that is what may happen, especially in counseling (unless you suddenly try to see things from her perspective). Only you can answer that."
"What are you hoping to accomplish by talking to her? If you're looking to pay child support and try to be a dad, it might be worth reaching out for your son's sake.

If not, don't bother. "
"You tell her that it's super weird and shame her. You document it all. And then when you divorce her, you make sure you get custody so she can't continue this shit.

Drill it in this is not how mothers are supposed to behave."
"Is he contacting you through his work email?  I would do your younger self a solid by going ahead and getting HR involved this time.  I realize you no longer work together, but perhaps his own HR department or boss would be interested in seeing the harrassing messages he is sending from his work computer to you?  Otherwise I think your plan of a firm and no-room-to-argue message stating that he stop contacting you (leave the police threat off of it unless his messages are threatening) once as a final warning is good.  If he violates it, you can look into your professional and legal options to protect yourself.  I would also encourage you to research ways to block his number or email afterwards as well."
"I've been in your shoes (kind of) before. I didn't get an STI, but I found out he had a girlfriend after the fact. I waited until he fell asleep, went in his phone, wrote down her number, and called her. I said ""I don't know what your arrangement with your boyfriend is, but he had sex with me on these dates and I only found out about you just now. I won't be having sex with him ever again but I thought you deserved to know."" He phoned me five minutes later screaming and I just hung up on him.

They stayed together for something like 4 more years, but my conscience was clear because she knew what she was getting herself into. I don't know if he cheated in the future, but I've never for a moment regretted telling her. As long as you don't have ulterior motives (like wanting him to ditch her to be with you,) your conscience will be better off if you tell her."
"Yeah, that's the worst part of this, him telling her she's blowing it out of proportion ‚Äî he's confirming that their anniversary is NOT very important to him, why is she making a big deal out of it? 

The only way to fix this is to tell her it IS a big deal to you, OP ‚Äî and you have to mean it. Ten years is a huge milestone. You need to make it clear that you get that and want to give the occasion the celebration it deserves. Unless you don't feel that way. Then, well, I guess you just let her be mad. 

My 10-year anniversary is coming up in a few weeks. I'd be really hurt if my husband forgot. I actually did get a little upset because he put off requesting time off work for the anniversary trip we'd been planning. We had literally been talking about taking this specific getaway for our 10th anniversary for a few years now. So when I sat down to book the trip and he hadn't requested off, I was hurt ‚Äî he knew it was a big deal to me and that I'd been looking forward to it for a few years. He didn't tell me I was blowing it out of proportion. He knew it was important to me. He explained that things had been hectic for him with a recent change in jobs and he'd forgotten, but it was important to him too. He made sure to schedule the time off as soon as he got in to work the next day. That's how OP should handle this, IMO."
Lots of STDs dont show symptoms immediately or ever.  Still need to treat them
You husband should break up with *you*.
"This only works if the dad is in control of his anger issues. Some fathers are very particular about their daughters and their love lives, and they throw all logic out of the window when they can't handle it.

Just for an example. My dad found a hickey on my neck, which is absolutely not a sign of sex at all and is only an indicator of kissing (I was a total virgin at this point), and he proceeded to choke me against a wall while calling me a nasty whore."
Ubers are safe. New York is safe. Just keep your head up and follow your gut. 
"Your problem isn't that you're finding it hard accepting the kind of lifestyle your boyfriend has and wants for you in the future, it's that you haven't fully realised that you're in a controlling relationship with a jealous man who verbally abuses you. He has no right to tell you what you should be doing after you finish work for the day, or which company you should be working for - no right *at all*.

Don't marry this guy, OP. His behaviour won't improve and it will be far harder to get away from him if you do."
"yeah, I think OP underestimates how startling it would be for secular parents that their kid became a radically conservative Catholic who married a much younger woman he barely knew because his priest brokered a meeting. it's totally reasonable for them to have concerns about all of this! i would too, in their position. "
"There's not really enough detail to go on for me to ultimately say whether you did right or wrong. I will say perhaps that it would've been better to PM people to call them out rather than right there on the group chat, but even then, I don't know what you actually said, and nor do I know this history behind it or if this is the first or the latest incident of the family making nice with your attacker.

Edit: Having seen your edit, I don't think you were wrong for calling them out. Part of the reason that this kind of abuse happens and then continues is because of others trying to sweep it under the rug and give their tacit support to the abuser. They choose the easy option rather than the right one. Personally, I would have very little to do with your family from now on, or at least those who support an abuser."
"&gt;He's apparently missing in a foreign country, no one knows where he is, Sonya gets these weird calls from different numbers every couple months (it's been two years). **This is all mostly new to me**, and the moment I start to hear her getting weird calls from him,

Her and her friends' rudeness aside, why hadn't she told you that he's been calling from random foreign numbers the entire time you've been together? Just seems like something you'd mention, even just like, ""Isn't that fucking weird?"" To then try to push you away from the table while they talk about it, I dunno...this is shady af..."
"Now, I'm not saying this is how it might turn out, but I will tell you from painful experience - this is exactly how abusive relationships start. Exaggerating tiny little things into huge blow-ups. implying all kinds of malice (I mean, calling you a liar? Really?) and not relenting until *you* are the one apologizing/giving in. Add in the name calling, and the controlling bit about the web-site (*she* was the one calling the shots, and if only you'd listened to *her*...).

Get out. Now. You deserve better.

Also,  therapy. Yesterday. If this is feeling normal to you, that could be a problem and getting some professional perspective on it can only help."
"OP, I didn't read anything in here about kids. 

Honestly,  you two sound like you're at two different stages. You sound a bit less mature, and frankly,  like you enjoy all of this going out and having guys comment on your underboob on Insta.  Here's the thing:  your husband isn't comfortable with you posting that shit.  As a supportive spouse you don't *sneakily erase the offending comments* you don't post shit like that to begin with.  Simple af.

And going out without your husband,  then turning off your phone cuz you were high on coke with your addict friend?  It's all age- appropriate shit *if you don't have a husband waiting at home for you*.

OP, with all love,  either grow the fuck up or let your husband free of this mess.  For both your sakes. This isn't healthy. "
"The trust is *hugely* broken here, IMHO. I could see waving off lies about going to the gym if it were like, ""I'm gonna go to the gym later"" and then you feel tired so you stay home and crash. But his lie about the gym was the smallest lie in a very deliberate pattern of lies. Honestly, whether someone lives at home with mom vs has an apartment of their own - that's pretty damn significant. The fact that they claimed to have a car, when they've never had one - what the fuck?

As far as the book is concerned - you and I both know that he never bought that book. If you live in the US, at least, things rarely get lost in the mail. Beyond that, if I did order a book in such a way that it'd be delivered by mail, there'd definitely be a record of it, because it'd have been an online purchase. So if he claims to have bought this book, ask to see the records. Ask to see the credit card statement with the purchase showing. This guy has lied his ass off, and you can't believe a damn thing he says.

Above all, for your own sake, don't have kids with this asshole. If you decide you have to stay with this lying sack of crap, then delay kids for at least a couple years until  you can be sure that he's on the straight and narrow - and get marriage counseling until then."
Your consent was conditional. He intentionally broke those conditions. Why are you having sex with someone who gives zero shits about your consent?
"Just something I picked up from your ""background"" paragraph. You have been together for 15 months, living together for six. You have two small kids, that I'm assuming you have custody of, given the need to have them collected from daycare. 

I know it's weird and nitpicky to point out that you have created this family dynamic with this guy when you moved in with him after barely a year together (from the information you've given me), but I'm thinking this isn't the first time he's been kinda thoughtless or selfish? 

When he told you the plan, what did you say? 

""If you go tonight, I won't be able to join you."" ?

How did he react to the understanding that 1. You would not be able to join him and 2. That would really upset you because you were excited and made arrangements in order to join him. 

Right now the 5 year age difference is pretty apparent. You're living the adult life with commitments and sacrifices while he is closer to being a freshly minted adult with all the freedoms and none of the responsibilities. I assume he didn't have to book leave for that day? Or that his week wouldn't be impacted by the change of plans?

At first glance; it's a selfish and shitty thing for him to do. On a deeper look; is this a one-off or is this part of a larger pattern of behaviour?

As for what you ""should"" do - I prefer to think of ""in your position, what would I do, if I were you?"" I'd walk. Or kick his ass out in the breakup, seeing as you live together and it's easier for him to move than you and two kids. His behaviour is thoughtless and selfish and in your position, I wouldn't tolerate when I would want someone to be thoughtful and aware of my needs, as I am of theirs. "
"Jeez woman, I'm being crushed by all the pressure he's putting on you and I'm all the way over here... this is so so so needy and clingy and smothering, how on earth have you lasted 19 years?

I don't really have any advice, but I wouldn't be able to walk or sit if I were you. Also, that he gets mad or begs when you do say no... my god, thats just such a huge red flag to me. :/  Good luck to you!"
"To be blunt:  you are only 24 - why are you trying so hard?  Is this relationship really worth it?  

He's had 10 years to realize his issues aren't going away  - a decade - I may be wrong, but the way you wrote out events...it sounds like he wasn't self-motivated enough to work on this before, its only after he may loose you that he's putting in the effort.  That really doesn't sound like a quality man OP :/"
"Homeboy is panicking because he knows the next big change you make will be him.

I doubt he all of a sudden started acting like an absolute asshole overnight. I bet he married you because you originally had a low self esteem and he can get away with his asshole behavior. Now you've stopped putting up with it and he's freaking out.

All your changes sound great! You're doing great things to improve your life. Don't let this guy drag you down. His comments and demand only turn into ""jokes"" when you put your foot down. 

You don't have to live like this. Don't let him control your body. I wouldn't wait for this to get any worse."
"Maybe you should worry less about romantic relationships and more about therapy / counseling for your issues.

You seem ready to write off sex forever, rather than attempting to solve whatever your problems are."
"Some people will say to dance around this a bit, but I'd honestly just be a bit more forthright.  I'm 35 myself with my girlfriend who is 32. Most of our friends don't have kids and almost all of the people we hang out with regularly don't have kids.

I'm sure you completely appreciate that priorities change when you have a family. To them, this is a good way to be social and to have their kids play together and get a nice outlet. To you, it's almost like half babysitting and not a fun time. This relationship will almost certainly slowly fade away just for the fact you don't have kids.

You either have to do this song and dance around why you can't make it all the time, or you can just gently tell her that it just isn't the same now that there are kids involved and everyone has a family. It's either going to be awkward for a day or you can spent months skirting the issue until it comes to a head. Good luck."
"You contact the police and inform them that your mother is not allowing you on premises to collect your belongings.  You fear she will destroy your property.  Ask them to have a deputy arrive with you at a certain time to collect your property.  

This is more of the same power play.  She realized she couldn't control you through your wedding and is now controlling you through your possessions.  She is refusing to relinquish your property to you.  This is now theft.  You need to contact the police and file a report that she has stolen your property.  "
Obligatory he was 22 and she was 17 
"While I agree it's not OPs fault, her reasoning for not fessing up is completely wrong. Just because they have more money to pay the bill, it doesn't mean if you broke their stuff you don't own up to it. "
"He keeps telling me that he doesn't get why I'd think badly of him when all he did was fudge the truth about some small things. Like he doesn't get how I can get from ""not telling the truth about going to the gym"" to ""cheating and hiding it"" or whatever. I was starting to wonder if I was just overreacting. Now I feel better, that people are seeing the iffiness too and think that it's actually a big deal! "
"I'm so happy for you!

A similar thing happened to me and my boyfriend except I knew I was gay since I was a teenager and it was my boyfriend who realized that he wasn't so straight. ;) "
"Maybe ask her why she moves, and if she realizes how hard it is on you? It might be easier to put up with if you knew he reasons for her moving. If it's just because she wants to be a wanderer, that's a pretty shitty and selfish reason to put your kid through hell.

And, show her this thread. Let her see what others think about what she's doing. It might help."
"Someone had some good advice for these type of scenarios

1. Ask him to make a list of his priorities in his life.

2. Ask him to rank them.

3. Ask him to put how much time he puts into each of them, per week.

4. Watch as he either has a realization or doubles down on his behaviour and go from there.

"I don't know how else to say this, but it sounds like you're looking to just get out of paying for a ring for your fiance and eschewing all of the tradition and sentimentality that actually comes with passing down a ring. "
"I did that, once. And then I went back to him. I feel like such an idiot. "
"Not to mention how she ""can't believe he would get all husband and wife with you after kissing"" her. That makes it sound like she was more jealous of OP and not pissed at the boyfriend for kissing her. If my friends' boyfriend did that to me I would be PISSED not sad they are advancing their relationship. It just seemed like her words didn't align with what you would expect her to feel if she was innocent."
"&gt; Diana's daughter clearly knows that her mum fucked up

True, and fortunate, but it's not like their won't be consequences for Lizzie's friendship with Diana's kids. Those kids will have their loyalties split between their cousin and their mother. From Diana's perspective, seeing as she's a terrible desperate person and all, she might view it as OP trying to manipulate her kids against her out of jealously because Diana has ""real"" daughters. She'll probably double down on hating OP and insisting that her daughter isn't family. And since Diana's daughters are at an age where even kids with healthy family dynamics would be seeking independence, it could become a real power struggle.

Suffice to say, cutting out Diana but not her daughters will not be a tidy process. Whatever degree of contact you decide to have with Diana, I would treat her kids with unwavering kindness. Both because you're grateful that they've become kinder and better people than their mother, which is no easy feat, and because they have the misfortune to have Diana as a mother. I think you'll find them envying your mother-daughter relationship, instead of Lizzie envying theirs."
"So she hasn't changed at all, really. She *will* trash the house again, you know it's just a matter of time. Lock up your stuff.

edit: OP, you should put this info in the main post (that she's still using and recently trashed the house despite apparently ""trying to make amends"".) It's important info."
"Nope, nope, nope. 

Sure, it sounds like you're accepting that him following bikini models is non-threatening. He's sexualizing them, but they aren't a threat and you're okay with it. 

But omg him following a 14 year old is CREEPY AF. And making excuses for her age? 'There's no way she's 14?' 

This gave me nausea. "

"I know you're not a sexual, but maybe try looking into asexual dating communities. It might be slightly difficult to find someone with a healthy libido. Otherwise you might consider having an open relationship, so that your partner could get their sexual need fulfilled elsewhere.

"&gt; I'm not interested in people telling me to just get a divorce

The reason people get divorces is so they can move on. By refusing to do so, you're preventing yourself from moving on."
"I'd go, especially if I could work remote. Think of it as a working vacation. 

Edit: I'm in my early 30's. I don't think you should skip this. It's a few months, know it doesn't mean anything (most likely) long term and have fun. Make some connections/amazing memories and keep your wits about you. I have a hunch you'd regret not going if this story ends with ""I met this guy and had this opportunity but decided not to"". Please OP, go and post updates 

Also, don't ask him where it's going. It adds pressure and obligation. Assume it's casual, but be a good guest and be appreciative and don't try and hook up with other dudes while you're there (I'll get downvoted for that I'm sure).  "
"Cherish every moment. I know time is short, but you will both be glad for every single second.

"Can you follow it up with a romantic dinner in a week or so? Be sure to take care of organizing the babysitter, and maybe grab a nice necklace or a spa gift certificate.

Just tell her you've got something planned and to dress up on x date, after you've made all the plans so nothing can fall through.

The week will give her time to cool down."
Don't be surprised when he gets caught/arrested. This was really dumb.
"Absolutely DO NOT give your savings to someone you are not married to. Most likely, you will never see them again. 

As far as houses, you need to work out what you want first. Even though you've been together for several years, it doesn't sound like either of you is planning for a future together (it really sounds like he just wants your money). Don't buy a house just because you can, do it because it's the best financial decision for you. "
"No conversation will deter me from watering my flowers, none."
"I was reading something about a recent tweet JK Rowling wrote in response to someone asking why they never got a letter. She responded something like ""I don't know why people always ask this. You got your letter. You were at Hogwarts. We were all there together.""

There was another thing I read on buzzfeed about people leaving notes inside copies of Harry Potter books about what the books meant to them and what not. For me, I used them as an escape when I moved to a big city to go to university and I was a bit lonely. I read them again when I moved to another big city 9 years later and then another big city 4 years after that. My god I love Hogwarts.

Your niece does need to dial it back. But she will grow out of it. As for your chat with her, perhaps remind her of what the books mean to so many people and that it's normal that they mean a lot to her too. We really were all at Hogwarts together. 

As for the reality of it all, perhaps reach her about the concept of escapism a bit. Even just to introduce her to the idea that this is what she is doing, but that it is normal...within reason.

Good luck"
"I mean, Hartosexuals are a thing, why not Steveosexuals?"
"You were not selfish to take the good room. She gets first pick every year because...? And she did his year too, it's just that she picked wrong. 

I don't know why you didn't get to choose the room before but having a baby doesn't override everything and everyone. The baby was fine, your brother was fine, it should've been a non issue but she wants to make it one. 

I don't think you should do anything else. You offered to switch rooms if the baby was having trouble sleeping, which it doesn't sound he did, you've been trying to reach out to her, you've done nothing wrong so don't act like you have. It will set a precedent that from now on that you'll do as she says. So be nice and polite but don't push for her to stop being a brat. "
"No is a complete sentence and YES you are allowed to say no to ALL of your older relatives about this. Unless aunt is busy with something else she can handle her grandchild. And by that I mean is in the middle of something she cannot leave otherwise walk away.

Your room? Nope. Stand your ground. YOU outrank these people right now. Even at the age of 14. 

I know you feel like your mother is too deep in her grief to reach out to but at least try. Just tell your mom that while you appreciate everyone coming to help, you are not going to sleep where your father died. That is hurtful and disrespectful. 

As to people telling you how to feel and grieve, ignore them. 

Also if you end up yelling, do so. Don't feel bad. Its normal. You are not being rude, disrespectful or anything else someone might say. And if they do bite back, ""You do remember that its MY father who has died right?"""
"It's really bizarre behavior which is leading to imaginations running wild, but at the end of the day it could also just as easily be a wildly irresponsible, likely mentally ill woman who has no other adult to keep her in check as she drags OP along for the ride.

I mean ... she could have a stalker. She could be in the witness protection program. Maybe OP's dad was a rapist and/or extremely abusive. Maybe she's in massive amounts of debt. Maybe she's a kidnapper. The behavior is so bizarre, I could personally believe any kind of Lifetime movie explanation."
"Well, the distinction between ""permission"" and ""blessing"" is an important one. ""Permission"" implies your dad has a say in the decision, while ""blessing"" just means ""It'd be cool to know you're down with this, but we're getting married regardless.""

I, personally, would have no problem with my SO asking for my dad's blessing just to avoid dealing with him being sore about it later. I don't agree with the practice personally, but I don't feel strongly enough for it to feel really wrong or like anything I'd even think about after the fact.

If it would feel wrong for you, or like it would take up real estate in your brain after the fact, don't do it. You're used to dealing with your dad's disapproval and it's not like this would change what he thinks of your choices otherwise."
"So I just went through this exact situation a few weeks ago (in your girlfriend's position).

First of all, if she can, she should get the general anesthesia. Seriously, I have zero memory of the actual procedure and I greatly appreciate that. I've heard it is an extremely uncomfortable experience. I think I read through just about everything on r/abortion to get a sense of what to expect. It might be worthwhile for both you and/or her to look through.

As for things you can do:

* My boyfriend bought me chocolates while I was getting it done. I love chocolate so I was really appreciative.

*Have a heating pad ready to help with her cramps. Seriously, heating pads were miracle workers for me.

*Just be there. My boyfriend literally just sat there and petted my head for hours while I was curled up in the fetal position drifting in and out of sleep. It felt amazing. He was probably bored out of his goddamned mind.

*Just ask her what she needs. Its different for everybody, so what I needed might be different than what she needs.

*Be patient. Her body will be out of whack for a while, don't pressure her or complain if she's unable to go immediately back to normal."
She needs therapy to escape their clutches. Her family is not a safe place for her but she's continuing to interact with them. 
They're so controlling. Choose university because it's your life. They don't have your best interest at heart if they are making these ultimatums. You're an adult and they seemingly have no trouble ceasing all communication with you if you choose to pursue an education?? That's manipulative and unhealthy. I wouldn't want anything to do with them.

"Can I ask a really stupid question - why does a YouTuber need a manager? Do you like help them get in touch w/ folks for their side hustles? Do you coordinate where they can shoot/get licenses from the cities?

"Go sleep there now, then. Tell him he can leave and you would totally be fine with it. Stop playing her game. It would probably be best to tell him ahead of time so she doesn't manipulate the situation. I would also tell her how incredibly inappropriate this is with a boy going through puberty- he needs his privacy. Also, this is no way to live. You deserve your own happiness. If a divorce happens, I would try to get full custody."
"You're right, thank you.  Your response about boundaries really hit it on the head for me - that's why I have such a creepy, uncomfortable feeling.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

My bf is particularly avoidant.  He doesn't seem comfortable, but he's not uncomfortable enough to say anything yet.  There does seem to be a sense that he wishes he could outsource all of his problems.  It also doesn't help that our relationship feels like it is constantly teetering, so it's ripe for someone manipulative with her own clear agenda to step in and gain control.  Feeling a bit sick right now."
"As a daughter treated like dirt for not being a son, and told so, please don't have kids with someone who is fundamentally sexist. He won't change, they never do."
"&gt; she surprised me with the tinder thing

That's called cheating. Communication happens before an event takes place, not after. She cheated on you and you're allowing it. You absolutely were taken advantage of. You agreed to one specific girl and she used the situation to get away with much more. I have a very hard time believing she'd stop even if asked and since you're long distance you wouldn't really know either way."
"I wouldn't let you to be honest. Especially since the whole thing came up this week on the news about tourist areas in Mexico having safety issues. I'm Mexican too and my own mother has been wanting to take my daughter to Mexico with my dad but I refuse. I personally think it's a risk. It's also a a bigger responsibility for you since its a pair and not just one, and they are faily young. Maybe ask in a couple of years?"
"On top of the general advice that he is being dramatic and looking for a fight, liking those pics was not stupid or thoughtless. For him to even know that means he's following his ex's fb and also digging in to who likes what she puts up. Now THAT'S dramatic.

Also, short of abuse or some other horrible action on the part of his ex, you guys are allowed to have whatever contact you want with her."

"&gt;Tom didn't say anything to my mother before he made sure she was who she says she was.

"While people discuss whether or not it was smart to hide this from him for so long, I'd like to urge you to not tell him in person, or tell him in person with someone you trust in the room as well.

So, err on the side of caution, OP. "
"Send that embarrassment to my country back to us, don't worry about him, take care of yourself instead.

"This is what I was thinking. My fianc√© was like this at first - he had a fairly conservative upbringing and here I was traipsing around the house naked half of the time. It wasn't that he didn't find me attractive, it was just that it was hard for him to find my nakedness sexy when it counted when I was naked, like, a lot of the time. 

We talked about it more and I saw that as much as I felt comfortable in nothing, it would be better for us and our sex life if I covered up more often, lol. So I got some shorts and tanks to wear around the house and it reeeeeaally helped us. "

"This is the best advice I've seen in this thread. There is no salvaging this. He knew what he was doing was wrong -- this wasn't some one off hookup in the heat of the moment. He has put you and your family at risk for years without remorse. Financial peril for you all, and health risk to you. He's been sleeping with a woman and could potentially be passing diseases to you! Does that sound like someone who loves and cares about you and his family?

Leave him. I understand the emotions that are tied up in this but you have to protect yourself and your family. This man does not have anyone but his own self interests in mind."
"Absolutely this.  He's going to escalate and will eventually do something to you he can't apologize away.  It's happened to friends of mine and it will probably happen to you too.  Get out now, let him fix himself on his own schedule.  The phone is not the issue here."
"I think you should A) decide, like, now (you're in your late 20s and it has been 3 years FFS), if you want to marry this girl, and then B) either be a dashing dude and say, ""Babe, I'm sorry I'm so daft, don't you worry, within the next year, there will be magical things happening..."" and then propose in a few months (but not at the exact same time as her friend), or, if she's not the one for you (or if marriage is not for you), break up with her and let her find the guy that wants to marry her. 


Maybe her timeline talk wasn't the best way to go about things, but that's how her frustration came out, and as others have said, there is a lot of pressure in your late 20s as a female to get married but with culturally male control over it. Don't worry about the timeline, just decide, and then reassure and do it or let her go. You kinda sound like you want her, though."

"Somebody needs to call the MOH from that post about the mother who showed up *in a wedding dress* to the bride's wedding. Maybe she'll offer her services. 

If you're not the type of person who can brush it off when your sister makes an abject fool of herself, then just demote her. She can come as a guest, and that does mean she won't be in as many photos. The wedding party can be composed exclusively of sane people. If you want to keep her in the wedding party to minimize drama, learn to sigh sadly and shake your head if anyone asks about why your sister's being such an ass. Poor thing, she's just emotional about her baby sister getting married! You'll look like a saint and your sister will look like a maniac. 

Or, you know, have a ride-or-die friend dump two full glasses of red wine on her frankendress. Always an option. "
"I understand and that's fine. Try to post on facebook and find someone you personally know for the cat.


Cats with behavioral problems tend to not get adopted. You need to accept the fact that once you give up your cat, she has a high chance of being put down or neglected.  


Her sitting next to you is indication that she is attached to you. She does love you and relies on your existence. 


I'm surprised that the vet said she is fine because her behavior indicates a health problem to me. It might not hurt to get a second opinion.


I hope that someone who has the time, patience, and love will adopt your cat. Best of luck, OP."

"Not to try and delve too greedily and too deep, but what do you think is driving this on/off dynamic? Because it sounds to me like he's ""enjoying"" his anger and feels kind of righteous in it, that's why he's ignoring your pleas and apologies (and offer to get the stupid scratch buffed out). If that's teh case then there's really not much you can do except wait for teh glow of his anger to subside, but then you'd have to know that he's just going to be waiting for the next thing to come along."

But don't be like my mother and stay with a man that ignores you for 15 years (true story).

To be fair to your BF, he may no longer have time to be in a relationship given the very high demands of his career choice.

"I would have your boyfriend talk to your dad.

"This is a serious issue, and you're right to be concerned about it.

When looking to see if someone is a good partner to you it's very useful to look at how they treat your emotions. Do they see your emotions as valid, as important as their own, as something to take into consideration when making decisions, and something that are real even it's just a moment of insecurity or a little overwhelming that you need to work through before being able to adress. Your boyfriend fails to do many of these things.

* He intentially invoke negative feelings in you for no reason.

* He thinks your emotions are amusing or a plaything for him.

* He says you are not allowed to have emotions that are inconvienient to him.

* You're not allowed to have or work through emotions that he dislikes, even when you make an effort to onlye express and process your feelings away from him.

These are serious issus, because it shows he doesn't think your feelings are real or important. Your feelings are his playthings and you should perfom on command, or your feelings are inconvient and you should stop having feelings on his command. Notice how you always have to feel what he wants and how it effects you isn't a concern. That's really, really bad. That's a major warning flag for abusive relationship.

Also, that the rules he sets for you are rules you can't possibly follow is another red flag. You're supposed to be upset sometimes but at other times not react at all, and no way to tell those situations appart. He's setting you up to fail, and when you fail he is justified to be angry at you. So he's creating situation to be angry at you. Again, major red flag for abuse.

I'm sure you've been lectured before on large age gaps, and that it increases the risk for abusive relationships. It might feel judgemental when you're in a happy, healthy relationship with an age gap. But considering that you're relationship has some serious red flags, then the age gap and that you're concerned about being ""childish"" does become another potential red flag.

You need to re-examine your relationship to see if there are other serious red flags and if you're relationship is healthy. That can be difficult to do, especially as in your first relationship you lack any frame of reference. So go to loveisrespect.org and take some of the quizzes they offer. It should give you more insight into your relationship. If the results you get back concerns you, then start a chat, call or text with the representatives of loveisrespect.org for more perspective and advice. Good luck!"

"I am 24F and I have had so many jobs that started like this. Weird things that I told myself were just a difference in personality and wouldn't matter down the line once I was secure in the position. Recently I had a remote job as well and the emails started out about this level of oddity and got progressively worse until I was forced to either go along with some weird shit or quit. I chose to quit. This is the 2nd time something like this has happened to me.

Here are some inexpensive hotels in the area and their going rates _____"". 

Honestly, if they can't provide basic things like that then the job is going to be one big headache. Especially when the boss is sitting on a pile of money and trying to cut corners with new naive employees. "

"Right now, yes.

If she actually gives the dog back and explains how much she loves it? Yeah, that's kinda vicious. OP didn't steal the dog; she's in the same situation the original owner is in, an ownership dispute over a dog she loves and wants. I don't think it's likely she's going to hold a grudge that OP didn't immediately give the dog away, because they're thinking the same thing.

It would be mean and honestly pretty hypocritical for her to respond that way if OP gives the dog back. Was OP supposed to just leave her there, at a home without her food, toys, etc of the last two years? Just be like ""okay Emma, I know you've helped me through tough times but I happened to run into your original owner so I'm gonna just go home alone from our daily walk forever""? Considering the original owner is asking her to suddenly give up the dog that, as far as she's known, she's owned legitimately for 2 years, you'd think she be a bit more empathetic to the ""I have an attachment to this dog and it took me a day to come to the conclusion that giving her back is the right thing."""

"He has chilDREN with another woman. Not one but several and how on earth did you not notice this happening under your nose? Surely something has changed since he has time for not one family but two, without his life long friend and partner since FOURTEEN noticing?? Why are you even contemplating staying with this lying, cheating asshole? What are your kids gonna think when they grow up, meet their siblings that probably aren't that far off in age and ask you what the story is? They, as well as us here on reddit won't be able to understand how you can *ever* forgive this douchelord. "
"This is a great response. I think there is hope for him considering he only fucked up partially, primarily in the first act, when he wanted to bring the entire family together to air our their grievances. At this point he was full speed ahead on the ""you fucked up"" train. I have to say I got really angry for his fiancee when he dismissed her beef with his mother as ""women are sensitive to these things and I didn't notice."" How is it so hard for people to understand that many persons can show one face to their beloved child, and another to family interlopers? If this is the love of your life who you trust and respect who hasn't shown herself to be manipulative and underhanded, why would you NOT trust what she says to be true, especially if she's just demanding basic respect, not cutting off ties with family or anything outrageous? It's automatically putting her in the position of causing trouble and necessitating this airing of grievances, even if she's being harassed herself, and it's so unfair. If I was his fiancee, at that point I would have been furious with him, though to his credit he did eventually have her back. 
 
He recovered in act 2 when he refused to allow his parents to rope him into some belittling session at their house and refused to take their calls. He risks re-boarding the ""you fucked up"" train if he allows his parents to attend the wedding. They want him to cancel it! They are for certain not going to behave well because they'd literally rather ruin his day and the entire event than see it happen without a fuss. They need to see that their behaviour has consequences and they can't control his whole life. "

"Wow are you unfairly loading all sorts of baggage onto Alan and living together.

* He is not responsible for you losing a close friend. Why are you even viewing this as a sacrifice to be with him.
* Finding a job and living near him has nothing to do with whether you live in the same place or not.
* The fact that you don't have a roommate lined up is not his fault
* Regardless of where you live, you will need to find a job.
** living with him ‚â† living rent free
* The need to get rid of things (assuming you actually need to get rid of stuff) is not his fault.

Moving in together is a HUGE commitment, and your reasons for wanting it are not about making the next step in the relationship, they are all about making life easier for you. That is unfair.

If Alan is not ready to move in together, he is not ready.

* this does not mean he does not love you.
* It does not mean you can't have a beautiful relationship (now and in the future.)

Stop throwing a fit over this for selfish reasons.

If/When the two of you move in together, it should be because you are ready to move your relationship forward.

Otherwise, you should deal with life as an adult, not expecting easy solutions on the back of someone else."
"Act like you don't see her as a threat AT ALL. Like you don't notice this whole ""I'm soooooo close to him"" thing. It'll drive her CRAZY and eventually she'll give up on it because if your boyfriend doesn't reciprocate any of this then she's just wasting her time and looking stupid. If you take the high road then there's no ""ugh your girlfriend is so controlling and bothered by me!!!!"" story she can spin. Since your boyfriend is saying he feels nothing, believe him. 

She can flex about how she knows his parents, his friends, and reminisce about their many great memories from all their years of friendship together all she wants, he still chose someone else to date and she's gonna have to deal. The only way she could break you up is if your boyfriend reciprocates and in that case you'd be losing a cheater which is a plus"

"If people are crappy about it and you want to screen for that, you could put something in your profile about how you're always looking for new Celiac-friendly restaurants. Keep it light. Don't treat it like you're confessing some horrible flaw, because it's not one. 

I'm not sure why you're getting so much pushback from people. One of my best friends has Celiac, we go out to eat regularly, and it... doesn't really affect me? She asks a few extra questions or we go somewhere she trusts, we get our food, life goes on. Unless you're being rude or pushy, which it doesn't sound like you are, I think the problem is with your friends and family, not you.

If you don't want to mention it on your profile and you do want to go on a lunch or dinner date, suggest a place yourself. If you want to bring it up, you can always say, ""I have Celiac, so my options are a little more limited. How about coffee at Just Coffee No Bagels or dinner at Bob's House of Preparing Food on Different Surfaces?"""
Unfortunately I think you may be correct.  
"&gt; weird that be would try and convince OP that it's hers though

Is it? I think this is a natural reaction if he genuinely has no idea where it came from. To him, the only way it could have come in is through OP, so the most logical explanation is that she's forgetful. If he has anything to hide, he'd come up with a lie that could convince her e.g. his washing machine was broken the other day so he did a wash at the laundrette, or his cousin visited.

Look at it this way. If a girl in a relationship caught an STD, and confronted her boyfriend, and he told her ""maybe I caught it from a toilet seat"" then it's pretty shady because it's obviously a bull excuse. If he told the girlfriend ""you must have caught it"", it's more likely he's telling the truth because it can only be from one of them, and he knows it wasn't him.

Or maybe he panicked and he's a shit liar. But generally I don't think that's shifty at all, I think it seems honest."
Sounds like your parents were just using you guys as placeholders. When biological children came along...well you're no longer needed.
"I was the tomboy girl growing up with two brothers in a neighborhood full of boys. I did everything my brothers did: fishing, roller hockey in the street, baseball in the backyard, etc. 

My parents did want a girl (probably because they got the boy first), but they both wanted a princess who was a cheerleader and beauty queen. I'm not kidding, when I was around 7 my mom pointed to the Miss America pageant on TV and told me it'd make my daddy so proud if I was in that event. :( They were disappointed when I said I wasn't trying out for the cheerleader squad in junior high. The only girly thing I did was ballet, which I actually enjoyed because it was another athletic activity. I probably would've liked it even more if they had enrolled me in karate instead. 

Growing up knowing that I was a disappointment because I wasn't a sparkly princess definitely hurt. I couldn't change who I was though and pretend to be someone else. Having experienced that I would've been very cautious about having children with anyone who expected their son or daughter to act a certain way. Someone once asked me how I'd react if I had a girl or boy who wanted the sparkly princess life and I said no problem, I'll buy all the glitter and sequins and ribbons. What they want is more important than me living out my childhood all over again vicariously through them."

How can you possibly build a life with this man? This is ridiculous high school behavior that he's 20 years too old for.
Am I missing something?  Your Mom asked Aunt to pick out the things she wanted from the house and that's what your Aunt did.  Has Mom communicated that she wanted some of these things too?  
"&gt; am I doing this all wrong?

there isn't a right or wrong way to do that

if you don't want to date this well off pretty girl who you get along with nicely with that emotionally supports you and is amazing then don't

but be aware that if you break up withher to go play the field and ""see what else is out there"" you probably won't be able to get her back"
"Revealing pictures on Instagram aren't great, especially since you are getting inappropriate comments that you then hide from him. I want to give you the benefit of the doubt but pictures emphasizing your cleavage and in the tub are a bit immature for a married woman. Look at maybe improving yourself and that will improve your marriage "
"&gt;We share a lot of things but money is not one of them.

So it sounds like he might have something in mind he can't afford, and when you won the lottery he's the one who started seeing dollar signs. "
"How long have you been together?

I think it's totalllly rude and presumptuous of him to think he'd get half.  You're definitely not obligated to give him anything.

However, if I had a windfall and was in a serious relationship (living together etc.) I would pay off my loans/debts first but then might seriously consider helping out my partner with any loans/debts.  If you've been together for a long time and live together and whatnot I can see why he might have just assumed that the money would be used jointly.

But I definitely can't see why he'd assume he's automatically get half to do with as he pleases.  And I kind of doubt he'd split it with you if he won, frankly."
SERIOUSLY. Fuck that guy
"&gt; We don't want to rescind their invite because we want to retain the moral high ground in this situation and ensure that no matter what happens we can't be accused of any pettiness or retaliation - if it kicks off, we want the responsibility to be entirely on them and for everyone else to see it.

So basically OP knows his mother is going to cause a scene at his wedding, but it's ok because then everyone will be able to witness it. I mean, go ahead if you would willingly ruin your entire wedding just to prove a point. "
"Your thoughts about timelines made me realize there are two different ways to work out a timeline: counting back from a future date, or counting forward from the present.

Counting back is like: ""I want to have two children before I'm 35, so our first pregnancy should be around 33. I want to enjoy marriage without children for at least 2 years, so I should be wed by 31. Engagement should be about a year, so the proposal should occur by the time I'm 30. We should live together for a year before that, etc etc.""

Counting forward: ""It'll take me three years to get the promotion I want. Then two for us to save up for a downpayment on a house. We should spend six months travelling the world... And then save up for a ring and a wedding.""

These could result in very different timelines."
I think this is the correct answer. That definitely sounds like him. I guess it's just an odd feeling having it directed at me since when I was with girls it was a lot different. 
"Key life tip: Anyone who calls anyone else a ""homo"" as a derogatory insult isn't worth paying attention to. Yeah, it's an unusually generous gift for a girlfriend's dad, but it did the trick! So let them make their jokes, ignore them and it'll blow over. Part of me wonders if at least some of these ""friends"" of hers are guys who are just pissed off that you're with her, so are trying to undermine you. Don't give them the satisfaction, just feel deservedly smug that you're with her and her dad now thinks well of you."
"Is this the first time he's done this? If not, this would be the end of things, because who wants to deal with this?

If it is, tell him how you feel about it. You're disappointed that he couldn't simply say ""I don't feel comfortable attending your brother's wedding."" As it stands now, he's demonstrated that you can't trust what he tells you because maybe he can't follow through with plans because of work or maybe that's a lie because he really wants to party with friends. He screwed up and now he needs to earn back trust. "

"Going to second His Dark Materials and would like to add the 'Circle of Magic' series by Tamora Pierce. There are a couple of quartets and they're fantastic. 

Edit: quartets not quarters"
Valid point.  The supposed catalyst for this behavior may be a bit on the weak side.  There certainly could be more at play.
"Your family has a point in saying that you two really rushed the relationship/marriage. But, they also should be respectful of her. You may need to distance yourself from your family in order to really prioritize your wife and future child. "
"Wait a minute, are you saying that he only admitted these lies *after you already found out yourself*. That he hasn't come clean about anything of his own initiative? That's a huge huge red flag that you've only scraped the tip of the iceberg yet.

He hasn't come clean, he isn't sorry, he is blaming his past (something that can't be changed), and he thinks you have no right to be mad. Yeah, that's a big deal.

How does he treat other people? Not people that are important like his colleagues or his boss or a police officer, I'm sure he charming when it is useful to him. But how does he treat waitresses, shop employees, people who need help getting on the bus etc.? Is he *kind* rather than just *nice*? The way he treats people when there is *nothing in it for him* can tell you a lot more about his personality than the way he *charmed* you.


If you want to give it another chance, tell him:

* He has one chance to come clean to you about other lies he told you. These lies are a big deal to you. He needs to think long and hard about what things he ""might"" have lied to you about, and tell you the truth. If he says he doesn't remember, tell him it doesn't matter: he doesn't need to remember what it is he told you previously in order to tell you the truth about *everything*.
* You need to see his finances. His assets; his debts; what kind of insurance he has; and whether all correspondence with relevant institutions has been transferred to your new address. There might be all kinds of things that should be taken care of after moving that *he doesn't even know that he doesn't know about*. This is not just ""payback"" for his lie about living with his parents, it's normal for married couples to share this information and it is an absolute requirement to do so before having children together. If you want, you can make an appointment with a financial planner so you don't personally have to baby him to tell him what information to provide.

&gt; Just exactly how does telling you I went to the gym instead of gaming -- a completely harmless thing -- a few years ago make you doubt me when it comes to big things?!

It is for *you* to decide whether the difference between gaming and working out is important or not. If it is not important to you, he should have no problem just telling you the truth. If it *is* important to you, you are entitled to know the truth, not a lie. He doesn't get to decide what your dealbreakers are.

Also, was this a response to you complaining about this *specific* lie or was this a *deflection* by him after you complained about lying in general? Some of the lies he told are a really really big deal, 
like the not living with his parents one.

"
"This. This and this. I am in the exact same age group dealing with something suuuuper similar. A discussion with a close friend is the right way to go. However, I advise whoever it is you think would be best (or yourself, too) to *do some homework*. 

Alcoholism and the way that it is approached has changed a lot. For example, there is a lot less **you can never drink again** and **you're an alcoholic** and more ""don't drink today"" and to think about being alcohol free as freedom and exciting.  Rehab isn't for everyone. AA isn't for everyone. They have different types of recovery approaches. 

He still has so much growing up to do, and he doesn't have a family/hasn't lost his job so this is a great opportunity for him to fix these things about himself **first**.  

Also keep in mind that this friend should probably be okay with ""Mike"" not being too happy with him/her. Not because your friend gives Mike an ultimatum, but because often times the person with the problem is embarrassed, or feels that the other friend will judge them if they don't heed the advice.

Last, please please don't drop him as a friend. The fact that you are reaching out on his behalf means everything and he is lucky to have you. The ""if you don't fix this then we can't be friends with you"" trope only isolates your loved one.

"This is what always happens when a 30 year old dates a teen.


Eventually they'll get old enough to start wondering why they ever were in the relationship.


It's time because it's not getting better. It's only going to get worse. "
"I know this is advice that is always repeated here, but I'd recommend reading The Five Love Languages.  Both of you."
"She did. She was closer with her mom but she had a fine relationship with her dad too. Now she dreads seeing his calls coming through.  It's gotten to the point where she no longer wants to speak with him because it's always is a negative and depressing conversation, but she feel obligated to because he's alone."
Just break up with her.  She doesn't need to know who reported her.  You need to remove yourself from the situation.
"Completely agree, this is not your problem and by putting yourself into it your sister will think you're siding with Mom. She'll feel ganged up on and things can only get worse.

The 'big girl panties' made me laugh"
"It isn't your responsibility to make sure your parents are ok with your life choices. You're allowed to date whoever you want. If your parents want to maintain a relationship with you, they'll have to learn how to deal with your choices that they don't agree with."
"Tbh your sister sounds like a real piece of work and it sounds like her kids know. I don't think cutting contact with her will affect your daughter's relationship with the kids, and even if it did, its better than to have such a toxic person around."
"It sounds like none of your hatred for Lyla is healthy or fair - you hated her at first for escaping an abusive home, because you became the next target for abuse. Protecting herself is not something you should blame her for, she was a teen fleeing for her safety and sanity. You now hate her because your husband is an ass who couldn't handle being dumped by her (probably because he was an ass) and so used what he knew about her sheltered siblings to prey on one as a replacement for her. That's fucked up on his part, and absolutely not her fault at all.

You should talk to your sister. Ask your grandmother to put you two in touch. You should try to reconcile at least, since she was only escaping the same demons that have plagued you, but also have a talk about what her husband did that made her leave, and let her know what he has done in becoming your husband to replace her."
Oh hell no! Do not give him your money. If he leaves over this then you dodged a bullet. If he stays then he'll benefit over time.
"Will you ever be able to trust this man again. He didn't just cheat on you, he has a whole other family.

Pragmatically, do you work? Can you support yourself? Do you have skill you can get a job with? Because in your shoes, I can't see how this leads to anything but divorce. Keep in mind, there is no way he is going to cut the other woman out of his life, she is the mother of his other children.

Talk to a lawyer, just a free consult to get an idea of what's what and what your options are.

You might want to check in at /r/Divorce."
"You say she's the only one who keeps her door open. I have a dog and she has free reign of the house and I never close my bedroom door. Because she has proved that she knows her toys are for her and everything else is off limits. 

Do your roommates keep their doors closed because your dog has chewed up things of theirs before so they aren't gonna chance it? You're an adult. You have the ability to think through things and anticipate consequences. Why not keep your dog in your room with the door shut? Or crate your dog? It sounds like people were going in and out. The safest option for your dog would be to crate it. 

You made a $950 mistake. It's spilt milk at this point. No use in haggling once the milk is out of the carton"
"It's good that her mum is planning on getting her professional help, but how soon is 'soon'? Can they move this forward? It seems to me that her obsession is rooted in the bullying she's experienced, especially as you mention she's worried it will continue when she changes school - of course she'll want to go to a school in a completely different world! So rather than focusing entirely on the Harry Potter thing, I think the adults in her life should be trying their best to solve the bullying.  

With regards to other things to read, try her on Lord of the Rings. It's completely possible for an 11yo to read, although many adults complain that it's a slog (which I won't deny, it really is at times, the Council of Elrond being the worst of it). If she enjoys it then you can arrange a movie day/weekend and binge the films. It would be a good opportunity to show her that fantasy worlds are just that - fantasy. There is also the bonus that there are a few big differences between the books and films, so you could discuss these with her (might be worth you reading the books if you haven't yet, you could then broach the subject as 'I thought this would be something we could share').  

She's also at a good age to start reading Terry Pratchett, which is a lot easier than LOTR! Plus a couple of those have been made into TV movies.  

Another series which never gets enough love is Katherine Kerr's books. There are over a dozen books, all set in the same fantasy world with intertwining timelines as the souls of the main characters are reincarnated again and again. They're linked together by a mistake one character made and has to correct - and he can't die until he does. By the start of the first book he's been alive for 400 years and the books alternate between present day and past lives. There's magic (but magic users are not called wizards), dragons, elves, dwarves, mediaeval warfare, secret sects of assassins and dark magic users (still not called wizards). I've done a shit job of promoting them, but I find them fantastic. Hardcore fantasy fans tend to turn their noses up at them though.  

&amp;nbsp;   

In summary - the bullying needs solving. When you're at the library look for Tolkien, Pratchett and Katherine Kerr as they are also fantasy worlds which involve magic, but in a non Harry Potter way.  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Edit** how in the hell did I forget Garth Nix??? Either the Old Kingdom series or the Keys to the Kingdom series, I'd lean towards Old Kingdom though. They'd be absolutely *perfect* for her! (And unlike us poor souls she won't have to wait for years for the sequels/prequel). There is a short story between Abhorsen and Goldenhand called Creature in the Case, don't skip that one because it does link in with the rest. "

"Please consider it. You've been incredibly strong, but you have a whole lot of new pressures on you. There is no definitive right or wrong here, only what will be good for you in the long run. It sounds like you are torn between anger and longing.

Just take it at face value - an acknowledgement of your birthday - and move on; if he hadn't have sent anything would you be thinking 'We were together for so long and now he doesn't even wish me a happy birthday'?
"I don't think it was wrong, per se, but i don't think it was the right venue for something like that.  I'm not condoning what happened to you, but her chat had nothing to do with you or your other family member.  It was about your cousins pregnancy.  

If the person was invited into a general chat about how folks days went and making plans for the weekend, you'd have a little more ground.  Here, though, you took your cousins celebration and made it about you.

Edit-  OP, I apologize.  Given the edit, you were well within reason, she's being awful."
"Let me be very blunt: you do not bring two girls decades younger than you and your employees to a family get together. Absolutely nobody does that. Like his son should be able to tell this doesn't pass the smell test, and he's 7. Who the hell needs a babysitter at a family reunion? Half the point is to get all the kids together! 

And you looked at this, decided it was totally normal, and then blast your husband for being controlling when he's capable of seeing through this and probably figures you have to be capable of getting this too and so has probably realized that you know this is BS and why you're actually going.

And you're still hedging that you're right and he's still wrong. You must not respect your husband much."
I agree. My phones gonna die and I'm out of town? I stop at a Walmart or heck even gas stations carry cheap chargers. That's a hard bs excuse. Especially since he mentions she's on it often. 
"My biggest issues are that he can't admit that he screwed up, and that he doesn't think he did anything wrong."
"My boyfriend and I started dating very young (me 18 and him 20). He lied when he first met me about his sexual experience since he in reality had none -- he said he had gotten head from his Prom date. 

I remember asking if he had had any other partners since and he said, ""Nope. Just that one time."" I said, ""Oook..."" and thought he just had a really high number and was trying to hide it from me. He was in a fraternity so had easy access to a lot of young ladies. I asked him if he was tested and clean and left it at that. 

A few years (maybe 4...we have been together for 6) he was going back to work in his hometown over the summer and said there was a girl from his high school working with him. I jokingly said, ""I hope it's not your Prom date...she was cute!"" 

He said, ""No, it's not. Why do you bring it up?"" And I told him what he had told me before. He said, ""WHAT?! Who told you that?"" He had completely forgotten his smooth move lie. ;D "
"It's very individual. When I lost my virginity it hurt like a son of a gun and looked like a murder scene. Worse than any period accident I've ever had. 

But many girls I know had little to no blood."
"""Normal"" really isn't the thing here.  It's not really ""abnormal"".  It's a series of lifestyle choices.

Incompatible would be the better word.

You can accept that she has the right to do all of these things and support her doing them without wanting to date someone who does them, but you do have to tell her that her continuing down this path might result in the two of you breaking up.

&gt; Or should I confront her about them bothering me? 

confront is the wrong approach.  Talk.  

But yes.  You need to identify which of these things are dealbreakers for you and why, then talk to her about them.  For example, you decide that you can accept not shaving, and green hair, as part of bodily autonomy, but not showering is gross and you just can't be comfortable dating a wiccan.

&gt;I don't think I'd want her to change for me, but I don't want to risk growing resentful either.

She may decide she values the relationship higher than these new ideas.  And that's fine.  You should be accepting of *that*, at least."
"You need to own your needs and wants. You are absolutely allowed to desire these things and it doesn't come off as ""needy"" at all to want them.

What you need to be prepared for is that your needs may not align. He seems perfectly content with this arrangement, and I doubt he will step up if you don't ask because you're giving him what he needs. So either he will do these things, and you will resent that he is doing them for you and not for him - as you said - or he won't change anything at all. In both cases, you will have to move on to find someone who is capable of providing you what you need - someone who initiates seeing you more often, and not just in his home watching movies as his Netflix &amp; chill buddy.

Personally, I'd have one foot out the door at this point. It doesn't seem like your priorities are compatible from the way you discuss his work-life balance."
"Block them on everything. Block everyone that bullies you on every social media site. If they send you something threatening, screenshot them and then block them. Repeat if they make new accounts.

Ignore them at school. Don't make eye contact, and act as if they don't exist. If they physically touch you, tell the school immediately. If the school doesn't do anything about it and they hurt/assault you, go to the cops."
"&gt; if she somehow finds you and goes to court over this? 

If OP lives in the US, there's no way she would be legally obligated to give the dog back unless it was microchipped or the original owner had some water tight way of proving this was her lost dog. Lots of dogs probably look similar enough to this one that an old, emotionally distraught lady could be confused. No way a court would force OP to give away her dog without solid proof that it was the one that was lost. 

I'm not saying she shouldn't return the dog. I'm just saying this shouldn't factor into her decision. "
"Hon...there's no way you can compete with this imaginary person. The problem here is entirely with your BF. He's in love with a fantasy and he *used* you for three years. He's a piece of shit.

"This is a tough situation, I bet it hurts to be rejected by your dad like that. Some parents like to live vicariously through their children, it sounds like that's how your dad is with you and basketball. Hopefully he realizes how dickish he's acting right now - your health is way more important than playing sports in high school. 

Take care of your ""needs"" in life first, ""wants"" should not take priority, especially if they're in direct conflict with a need. Don't let your dad's childish behavior make you go against your doctor's orders, even if it sucks."
Plus their own relationship. How can he trust his brother after this?
"Headphones. The bigger the better. Refuse to remove them, just point at them and say ""So busy! Need to focus!"" and turn back to your computer.

Once upon a time, I worked in call centers and would just vaguely point at my headset and then make the universal signal for ""I'm on a call and the person on the other end will not shut up."" (This presumes that the barnacle is also on the phones and has very little time to practice their barnicular ways.)"
"I think they're close to breaking up because the mom didn't trust her fianc√©, she jumped to conclusions when she saw the pictures and trusted her son (who she knows doesn't like Tom very much) over her fianc√©). "
"Grandparents rights are based on the grandparent having a preexisting relationship with the child (often classed as 6 months). It doesn't come into play with newborns, its for situations like where the grandparent is involved with the kid, the parent dies, and the other parent cuts off access. Situations of genuine grandparent rights are very rare, usually what people perceive to be ""grandparents rights"" cases are actually custody battles."
"&gt; I'll try to find out why she locked herself in there to begin with. That seems to be important after reading your reply because it will show whether or not she was scared prior to him punching the door

Erm OK. Go on. That's a valuable exercise. Because there's so many other reasons why she would've locked herself in the bathroom during a fight, right?

Perhaps they were acting out ""Oscar Pistorius - the play"" now in technicolor...starring your sister. 

Or she just really, really wanted to figure out what talking to someone through a locked door would be like? 

Or maybe she just wanted to test how many punches could break their bathroom door? For metrics and all?  "
You are not obligated to keep a relationship with your dad if you don't want to. You aren't going to change the person he is at this point.
And it's not like they will be able to fully appreciate Mexico at that age. I went to the UK when I was 7 and I definitely wish I had been a bit older (I was a huge history nerd even at the time and wanted to visit the Tower but my parents thought it would be too scary so I wasn't allowed and I am salty to this day about that).

"&gt; Tell your parents they can introduce their girlfriend another time.

""Another time""? More like ""never"". Why should OP need to meet this person who she clearly has no interest in meeting? I'm also in an open marriage and can't imagine why I'd ever want to introduce a gf to my kids, or that my kids would ever be comfortable in that situation."
This seems like a legal advice/parenting subreddt question.
"Well I just found out that forwarding the mail wont mess with anything. I'm going to talk to the school and see if the change in our address would require her to have to move. The car is in both of our names and hey wont refinance the car into just my name when I am only working 20 hrs a week, so we are both kind of screwed on that front. The hardest part would be not seeing his daughter. Its like giving up a kid. It sucks. And it will destroy my kid."
"Your boyfriend is a jerk. 

The correct response when you make a joke that hurts someone's feelings is to apologize and not do it again, not complain that the person you hurt is spoiling your fun by asking for respect."
"You have 3 computers. your boyfriend borrowed, broke and refused to fix a laptop that is under a year old (according to you in the comments) He now wants you to fix computer #2 to give to his family since they cannot afford a working computer. Both of the first two computers have files you need, while you actually use computer #3. So he wants 2/3 of your computers...

I would not let your boyfriend have ANYTHING to do with anything you own until he fixes what he borrowed, it was less than a year old, normal wear and tear should not be causing blue screen. He is angry with you for having basic boundaries about not giving away your computers, after rendering useless one you were going to give your dad. Where are his boundaries? He is angry when you say no to something pretty basic, I think he is being unreasonable, expecting to have this much access to your belongings without accepting any responsibility for fixing/maintaining any of it. He sounds super entitled. 

Also, The best I would offer would be to wipe the computer #2/remove the files you need, let them work out a fix if they want to, but only after he fixes what he broke on #1. "

"Sounds like your boyfriend is happy with you and has told his friend that. Go talk to your boyfriend and give him a chance to comfort and reassure you. His friends may remember the past fondly, that doesn't mean that you're less important. Keep remembering, he's with you, not with Ella. "
"It's at the point where you are going to have to discuss this with your mom. There is a pattern here, and your sister in law has already made her point where she lies (by throwing this temper tantrum... which despite her having a baby, it doesn't entitle her to act like one).

Just discuss with your mom. Express how frustrating this is, and how you've tried reaching out, with absolutely no response. Express how this is harmful for all future family events, and for basically anything and everything involved with the family. You clearly want to resolve this, but at the same time not be walked over in the future. Your mom is unfortunately a part of this drama, since she's part of the planning every year. All parties involved need to be involved in the fallout too. Not only that, but it seems like maybe your mom can play the role of third party mediator between you two... 

At the same time, don't forget this. This is who she truly is as a person. Don't forget this in the future, as everything you say or do can and will be held against you."
"My jaw dropped when I read that.  I thought it was like 3 or 4 pics we're talking about here, which even then I wouldn't blame OP for being super pissed, but 59??  Even if I was following this chick as a beauty blogger or whatever she does, I'd be like ok enough with this kid already.  I'm sure lots of her followers just assume that's her daughter.  She's certainly not discrediting that by calling her mini me or whatever.  She must be out of control narcissistic."

"Sorry for the double post, just thought of something else: talk to CPS.

No, not to get your parents in trouble.
In some jurisdictions, children who were adopted from the foster care system (making an assumption cause you said you two were 8) are eligible for college funding, sometimes a substantial amount. Additionally, you may be eligible for an ""independent-living"" stipend until you turn 21. Can't hurt to ask. "

"I guess in some ways she sees Cleo as a better or stronger person. Lena tried going vegan and gave up after 3 days, while Cleo has been vegan for over a year. Lena also dropped out of college after her first year, while Cleo is pretty close to getting her degree even after our father passed away unexpectedly during her exams last year. My wife is a very attractive woman, but she has struggled with her weight since she was very young. She has always been overweight, except for a few months around our wedding when she really watched what she ate. I know Cleo has to work to stay skinny, but she has never been close to being overweight and it's not as hard for her as it is for my wife. 


My wife is a wonderful person for many different reasons, but it's definitely possible that she's jealous of my sister's accomplishments. 


I have brought up therapy, but she got very upset because she thinks I'm choosing my sister's side and that I don't believe her. And I guess she's right."
"Did anything traumatic recently happen in your lives?

Not to over-analyze, but sometimes people just feel like up and quitting because they're having a rough time due to an external issue.

"I have to agree.  I was dating a girl for about a year who started having worse and worse outbursts.  No matter how much we talked about it, how many ways we tried to identify triggers, it got worse.  

Then one day she had one of her outbursts in front of my four year old.  I ended things then and there.  Ever since she's been accusing me of anything she can think of, violence, alcoholism, drug abuse, etc. because she's so angry I left her.  

Like others have said, this is a massive red flag.  If he's not trying to work on it, then there's only suffering in your future.  If you plan on having a family, think about them as well as your own safety.  Anger issues are no joke.  Bail before it gets bad.

Edit: because big thumbs, small phone."
"I know how to change a tire, but have never actually done it myself because every time I've had a flat, someone else has insisted on changing it for me. Once, I pulled off the road into a neighborhood and there was a guy working in his garage- he rushed out not with a wrench, but with one of those things they use in the pit at Nascar races. You know, just in his garage, hanging out with his tools. He had the old tire off and the new one on in like a minute. 

Basically, people are pretty cool sometimes. "

You're spot on I hope OP sees this. 
"This is solid advice. There is a misconception that single = freedom, but I haven't found this to be true. Relationships allow for self-growth as well, and it seems you have the mutual respect for each other that's key for having it happen. 

You wrote ""...I want to experience dating and freedom to find who I am. I want to become romantically vulnerable to other people."" Is this something you could explore with your wife? What does being romantically vulnerable mean to you? Learning each other's fears, secrets? More physical closeness like cuddling, spontaneous kisses? It's been mentioned on reddit before, but perhaps taking the ""5 love languages"" together could help the two of you, as I wonder if a part of this is that you're on different wavelengths. 

I don't know what the future will bring for the two of you, but like /u/NapsAreMyFavorite wrote, there really isn't anything to lose in exploring a lot of these things within a relationship :-) "
Your heart isn't doing this to you. Stop acting like you are trying.
"Seems like a *trainwreck* of an idea, to me. I'd never have a threesome with someone I was really close to emotionally or socially, it would only be with someone who was socially expendable to me/us, but a lot of people want it to be with someone they know very well and trust.  
  
However, this dude definitely isn't someone I'd trust. He drugged you without your consent and then brought up having sex with (both of) you while you were in a vulnerable state - the skeeviest of skeevy.  
  
There's no time limit on exploring sexuality or threesomes together. You don't need to do anything *right now*, and a threesome with a committed partner is something I'd wait to be really sure that I *really* wanted. "
"Ultimatums are totally okay when you mean them.  If it's something you need for the relationship to continue, then that's that - you can't change that.  And life is a series of binary choices.

It is okay to not want to do long distance.  I couldn't do it either.  I've done it in the past and it's not for me.  And, frankly, you put your education on hold in reliance on his promise that he'd come with you in two years.  He's the one breaking his promise, not you.

If he can come up with a compromise that works for you and where he'll be with you enough to make the distance tolerable, then that's great.  If he can't, just tell him ""hey, I put my education on the back burner for the sake of our relationship before and it was your turn to do it now.  If your company is more important to you than our relationship and keeping your promise to me, that's okay, but I can't be with you if that's the case."""
"Agreed and I would like to explain further. The goal at this point is simple: keep the connection alive. Not to help her right away, rather to set the board so that you will be able to help her later. In a couple of years she will be able to find more ways to talk and be more effective at guarding some measure of private correspondence. 

Kids at her age (a sheltered 14-year-old) have trouble processing the big issues anyway when they are directly told about them (rather than getting the chance to experience them for themselves) -- all the more so if anything you say will be contradicted at home.

Finally, remember that being an adult woman happy in her own skin is itself a message to someone like this.

It is so hard to bite your tongue but if you keep this quietly positive, cautiously honest friendship -- you *will* get through some day.

How do I know -- a part of my family is in an abusive sect. I have tried both methods (""What your parents are doing to you is wrong"" vs the trust-building connection followed by later frankness). The first method, almost pure garbage in terms of effects. Anything can be twisted at that age, anything can be denied. It feels good and it feels brave but it does not get results like the second method."
"Your opinion on an ideal mate doesn't matter in this situation and adds nothing to the advice for OP. It comes off condescending and unhelpful. You basically said statistically she's less likely to be in a good relationship because she's had a few extra partners. You realize that right? It came off really /r/iamverysmart . 

You want a girl who hasn't been with a lot of partners? Neat. Go look for that. If that works for you, cool. Nobody was asking you for your evaluation of what YOU want in a partner. Because believe it or not, bro, women shouldn't take relationship advice based on what you are personally looking for. 

OP wants help with her situation. You haven't added anything of use in that area. "

"It does seem genuine to me.

It does read like the kind of apology and admission of guilt from someone who has taken AA and sobriety seriously and has probably done solid work with a therapist. No apology will ever be perfect, but this one certainly follows best practices. 

Which doesn't mean it's perfect, or that he'll never fuck up again, or that you have to forgive him, but it seems like he knows (and you seem to agree) that some civil contact for the sake of the children would be beneficial.

If you are concerned about how to approach that communication, maybe get some guidance from speaking to a therapist yourself."
"Guy with major anger problems tells you, ""it's ok, you don't have to work, you can be totally dependent on me""

He was full of shit and I fell for it for YEARS. He cheated on me, stole my money, and eventually left me in $25k of debt in OUR names and skipped the country. 

Learn from my mistakes. GET OUT NOW. This man does not respect you and he does not love you. He is manipulative and the levels to which he is stooping to lie to your face are really concerning. He will not stop."

"Of course she's trying to make you feel like a jerk - she wants you to feel guilty and say, ""Okay mum, you can live here as long as you want and do whatever you please."" 

She's had 60+ years to figure out how to live like a functional adult. It's not your fault she didn't. She was given $40k. It's not your fault she squandered it all. You gave her a roof over her head for 6 months, which is plenty of time to figure out an alternative plan. It's not your fault she didn't consider an alternative. 

Now she's crying loudly and making you feel guilty because that's the only trick she knows - make other people pity me and give me what I want.

Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Let her sort her shit out in a way that doesn't mess with your relationship or your quality of life. "
"&gt; There's been tons of posts of this nature recently and it boggles my mind.

Seriously! It's sad to me how many people out there just have zero respect or basic knowledge of what's okay in a relationship. Then the amount of people that put up with it is also equally sad. 

Edit - Like with this one, I read the post title and thought to myself, ""Well, that's just not okay at all.. Why is this even a question!?"""
"One disturbing thought: Are you sure she's not already pregnant?

I mean, it seems that her quitting was associated with you getting bonus/promotion, but if she's focusing on the SAHM thing...

You need to talk with her about what happened at her job, and that you don't agree with her being a 100% SAHM, and your fears about being in the position of having to provide for her and your kids by yourself."
"I don't have a ton of advice on the weight aspect of things. I will say though, that after 3 years, 1-2 times per week is on the better side of standard, I would say. Not to tell you what you should want, what you should expect or anything like that, just throwing it out there."
"OP, be prepared for an incredible amount of awkwardness and miscommunication at the beginning.

Now for some X-rated advice.  You and your partner will want to discuss in advance whether you intend to engage in oral sex as well as PIV.  Your partner should be aware there is a good chance you may experience some erectile dysfunction, while you should be aware there is a great chance she will not achieve orgasm, possibly ever, from ordinary sex.  

Even 50 years ago good Christian couples were reading together fairly explicit marriage manuals as preparation.  You two should do the same.  There are much more explicit books now and you should buy several just to be aware of the possibilities.  "
"There are two separate issues here and you are combining them into one.

This is his house.  Period.  He owns it and rents it to you.  He gets to make all of the decisions.  Period.  Stop putting any money of yours into the house except the rent. You are nesting and as a renter...that is not appropriate. Even if you get married, it is 100% his asset not yours.  

Your relationship on the other hand, is both of you.  It can be wonderful and you may go on to get married, have a dog and kid etc.  And it is completely separate from his assets.  It sounds like he has a financial plan and you have a family plan.  They may end up being the same, but you need to TALK about money, life goals, and timelines and AGREE to them."
"&gt;So I feel they both are a perfect storm of dysfunction at times.

This makes me sad for your sister, it seems like you are looking to make abuse a 50/50 problem. But given your examples it looks like it's all the husband.

&gt;so she called her husband selfish for not thinking about how this affects her. 

This seems reasonable. Normal people would be upset in this scenario and call their spouse selfish.


&gt;and he smashed the door hard enough to swing open, crack the door where the lock 

This is scary as fuck and is totally not a normal response. There is no indication that she was arguing unfairly but *even if* she was at her ""worst"" or cursing him out this would be an INSANE response. 

OP, have you had arguments with your spouse/girlfriend in the past? Have you ever hid in the bathroom becasue you were afraid of your partner? *Have you ever gotten so angry and out of control that your partner had to hid from you?*.

Things are already **VERY BAD** for your sister and her kids."

"Does everybody overreact in your town, or is there something missing? Why would the owner ban you guys from the restaurants before even talking to you? Why would this get you fired?

"Actually, I think your strongest argument is the safety one.  Theresa tries to take your children to do things despite her lack of judgement about what is safe for your children.  Tell the inlaws that even in the simple atmosphere of the camp, there have been close calls despite vigilant monitoring.  In the more complex atmosphere of your home and your city, it would be too difficult to monitor and keep the children safe, and it would be impossible to enjoy the visit while attempting it.  Safety precautions that protect children are hard to argue against, and they give you a reason to fiercely defend a specific position.  "

You took the time to write out this post for a reason. Trust your instincts on this: get away from this man. He will find reasons to not trust you 
"It's not her digital life you're being cut out of, it's the rest of her life besides a few besties and her parents. She doesn't trust you enough and isn't proud of the relationship enough to weather the storm of negativity that would come back at her from her social circle and that she brewed when you guys were struggling. This is a relationship issue, not a social media one. "
Did she grow up in unusual circumstances? With an outhouse or with parents who told her not to flush? It sounds like a strangely ingrained habit. Figuring out where it comes from might be the key to her figuring out how to change the habit.

"*What happens if you say no? What happens if you say no two days in a row?*
Saying no usually leads to a lot of pleading and bargaining. No two days in a row would lead to a big fight.

Not much that I know
*Are you able to enjoy being physically close without it being sexual?*
Me, yes. For him, that would be a tease (unless it was leading up to something later
*Does he show affection for you in other ways? Do you want him to?*
Yes, he is incredibly affectionate. Probably more than I would like
*Is housework and childcare split equitably? Do you have the same amount of free time?*
Pretty equitable, he does a lot with the house and kids. Free time is a disparity, he has much more than I do (no commute, etc)"
"Here's what I think it boils down to: does she lie/manipulate the truth to you and other people who are directly in her life? Or is it solely with respect to her instagram persona? I have a few friends that are successful enough in the entertainment industry to have personal brands in their online social media and the content that they post is incredibly curated. It has to be because that's what their followers want to see. Even a friend who's brand is built on being ""natural"" and ""honest"" still curates the shit out of what she posts. "
"Good lord that's a lot of sex. For what it's worth, that's way too much for me personally. It's ok to have different sex drives, it's not ok that you feel pressured into having sex, that kills the sex drive, quicker than just about anything. My SO and I have different sex drives (he's a daily kinda guy and I'm more of a weekly kinda girl) and for a while it caused us issues. But we communicated and have settled into a happy rhythm. It's possible, he clearly loves you so appeal to that love.

Later it turned out it was a manifestation of her undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenia. They got her professional help and heavily limited her internet usage which had apparently exacerbated her illness by giving her a community of equally ill people to push her on.

OP you need to get your son checked out by a professional first and maybe see if he's been frequenting those kinds of communities online as well. I think sometimes people with mild symptoms can be pushed over the edge if they get a nonstop feed of people confirming their paranoia."

Talk to your dad's GF. If dad doesn't like it that's his problem. Clearly talking about your period makes HIM unhappy. There's no way to know how Kelly feels about it without talking to her. 

Please make an appointment to see your doctor this week. "
You should probably go see a counselor yourself and ask for professional help to help your husband.

Hey! That's new to me. Not the red meat, I actually met a *dog* with a red meat allergy... 

So the caffeine, if you can forgive my curiosity...

Severe enough that you can't have tea and common cold medication? Does chocolate begets you an unpleasant bodily reaction? 

Are there any surprising foods or situations that involve caffeine that we might not be aware of? "

"You're talking about an ass who responded to his brother's announcement that he was having a daughter with ""maybe next time.""

Starting a family with someone like that is what's preposterous. 

"
"I lost my father when I was really young (12yo) and my mother would do the exact same thing to me. For years she would bring up my dad's death, how it affected her, how it changed our life, how untimely it was etc. I didn't know what to do at the time, and I suffered doubly - one for my father whom I lost, and one for my mother whom I felt unable to console. All I could do was reiterate how sorry I was, how I hope things would get better for us... strange things for a 12yo to say, but that was all I knew. All this is to say, I think I understand how your wife feels. 

However, what I realized after I grew a bit older, was that during these conversations I never actively acknowledged the situation. Not the facts, not the change, not the pain, not in any ""real"" affirming way. I knew what happened, by Gods I had heard it a thousand times, but I never actually **discussed** it with my mom. It was mostly her talking about it, and me ""agreeing"" and trying to console her.

So I started responding to her in a more ""conversational"" way rather than a ""consoling"" way. She mentioned many times how he died alone on the road, so I would respond with ""it was a road he traveled a lot on, him and that road were old friends, in a way I am consoled he wasn't in the middle of nowhere all alone"". She would say his heart attack was so severe, it would have probably been fatal even if he were in the hospital, and I would say ""I know, and to think his doctor said his last tests came back clearer than ever. That just goes to show that when it's your time, it's your time, so you better take better care of yourself so that time comes a lot later for you"".

I don't think I expected it to work to that extend, but the change was instant and totally worth the pain. The conversations were reduced, and even when they were occurring, they were shorter, and usually lead to other discussions. 

In case your FIL and my mom are on the same situation, and you haven't tried that yet, I would suggest your wife (with you if possible) try to respond to your FIL with more engaging questions. Acknowledge the information he is sharing, but then expand on it, ask him questions, have a conversation with him about what he just said. That is not to say he wouldn't benefit from a therapist, but if he is half as stubborn as my mom was, he won't go without at least first getting the acknowledgement he needs from his family, in this situation, the only reminder he has of his wife: his daughter. "
"Pretend to change your mind, but have the abortion anyway. Tell your boyfriend you had a miscarriage. Break up with him though, because he's not treating you well. Screaming at you and threatening to tell your parents are extremely unhealthy behaviors. I know you love him, but you need to love yourself more. He's a monster."
"You are too much drama for just 3 months. You snooped for no reason, misinterpreted a text, went after your BF for that, and you think this is just ""anxiety""? You are the proverbial batshit crazy GF, your BF was wise in leaving you. No way on earth you will magically start behaving from now on after pulling such nonsense over nothing. 


Snooping is a perfectly valid deal breaker for many people, deal with it and think before doing something as stupid as what you did. Quality guys want quality girlfriends, and normal, healthy people hate this type of drama. If you have trust issues, get therapy instead of imposing them to your partners and expect them to be fine with this kind of behaviour.

"&gt;he seems to think there's absolutely nothing wrong with being a virgin til 30 then staying with that one and only girl.

He's right.  Everyone walks a different path.

&gt;I am not a good looking guy, I am over 6 feet tall and work in construction as a laborer so I am kinda fit, about 230lbs. Thought I just look like an ugly caveman, beard and messy hair.

A lot of people feel this way.  Hell, she might think she's ugly.  We don't always see ourselves the way others see us.

&gt;My therapist tells me if I'm happy just stick with it.

He's right again.

&gt;how can I just stick with this and not experience more?

So how much of this is actually wanting to experience more and how much of this is self-sabotaging because you don't feel you deserve her?

I mean, if you're not happy in the relationship, yes, you should leave.  But if you're happy and she's happy, you're already experiencing more than a shit ton of people in the world.  You could go out and get laid and you could get another girlfriend, but to what end?  What if you're happy with the next one too?  Is two girlfriends not enough?  Three?  Four?  How many people do you think you need to date to know what happiness feels like?

It would be one thing if you were 20, but by this point in your life, you understand the basic concepts that younger people may miss out on by committing to a long-term relationship.  You've had friends and coworkers and family members provide examples of personality traits you do and don't like.  You're an adult that's cared for himself long enough to know at least most of what you need to be comfortable in life.

If she's making you comfortable, I say ride it out.  If the relationship stops being enjoyable, move on.

"I want to know what exactly you were hoping to achieve by continually failing to drop a stupid argument about a stupid topic where you had already been proven wrong, other than bugging the person you were talking to?

""She could not even admit the possibility that she could've been mistaken.""? Dude, there was no possibility, she was right from the start and knew it 100%, and even now, hours later, you are somehow trying to insist that there was always a *chance* you could have been right.

And over a TV show? Posting on Reddit about an argument of this minor level?

You are coming across as the kind of defensive person who struggles to admit when they are wrong, even over minor things. And those kind of people are exhausting to be around."

"The above comment is SO GOOD. 

Storytime! I once ended up doing laundry in my old apartment building with the woman who lived below us. I found her sobbing quietly in there. Why? Because she'd been with her boyfriend EIGHTEEN YEARS and she was beginning to think he'd never propose and now she was 45 and was worried she would never get to have children or be married.

Me, out loud: Wow, that sounds awful and upsetting.
Me, internally: And that's why [my then-boyfriend's name] has 2 more years to figure out if he wants to marry me or not.

I knew I wanted to marry him! And he and I had discussed that our relationship was serious and likely headed towards marriage and kids! But even so, I wasn't going to wait around forever for him to decide if HE wanted to marry ME. He was great and I adored him, but I wasn't going to wait forever for him to make up his mind, and I wasn't going to force him into a marriage he didn't want, either. 

I had to both give him the space to make a decision, AND protect myself from him not deciding anything for an eternity. Like hell was I going to end up 45 and crying in the basement laundry, you know?"
"&gt; I left and am safe and happy now but my ex has the house, the dog, all of my possessions, and his family and friends still think he is just the most charming piece of shit around while he has told them I left because I cheated. How original. I am left with nothing, restarting my whole life.

this is how my mom got out. i hope you're doing well! my mother is in her mid fifties with a clean slate and a brand new life, she has to work her ass off but she's never been happier."

"So.... his defense is that he thought he was looking at pictures of his girlfriend that she didn't want to share with him so he had to find them on his own?

I guess he has to choose what kind of sexual deviant he wants you to see him as. 

How did he even find them? Is he pretending to stumble on them? Do they have your name?

I'd dump him for being a sexual deviant but honestly his stupidity is enough of a reason too.

"For most of us closure is a mythical unicorn. You can't make someone sit down and give you an explanation. He's done with the relationship for whatever reason (and the reason is most likely this other woman).

He may have realised late that it was his birthday and felt guilty so acted out, or he may have been unhappy that you were spending a nice time away from him.  

Do you often go out by yourself/with a friend?  How was he the last time you did?  Not coming in with you is a real odd thing and I would consider it a warning that things aren't right.

How was your birthday last year?"
"I'd wager good money that there was never any book. Why didn't he track the package? I have a strong feeling he just stood by watching you wait for this to arrive--which is twisted--knowing it never would. Think about it, it's icky.

Also, if all these things were just micro-lies, then logic would have to ask why he lied about them in the first place. "
"Imagine if the tables were turned. Would you be cool with your husband going? If your boss has such harmless intentions, he can hire a middle aged woman to be the traveling nanny.

Considering that you've worked and hung out with J for 3 years, I'd say he's the opposite of controlling. If you love and respect your dude like you claim to, don't go on the trip. "
"If she was doing that to close friends or family, I'd say that it's a sign of deep insecurity.

But given that she has 50,000 followers, another way of interpreting this is that she is trying to build a brand.  ""Brand""-girlfriend is in Paris sipping a 5 euro coffee, real girlfriend is not.  Sting vs. Gordon Sumner.  Slash vs. Saul Hudson.  That's not really any more manipulative than any other kind of marketing, in my opinion.  The risk, which WAY too many people fall afoul of, is that she is unable to keep her person and her brand as separate entities.

Anyway, in my opinion, bad news in either case.  All that stuff about ""sly charisma"" and everything is further evidence that she wouldn't want to be someone I want any part of.  I like people who are more honest and forthright."
"I think he's just trying to do too much too soon. It's like he expected OP to go from not even knowing they were dating to playing happy families in the space of a single conversation. He's not taking into account that while *he* has had quite a while to get used to the idea of this woman as his partner, OP has not, and that he should err on the side of respecting her pace when it comes to folding Mary into their lives. Particularly at an emotionally delicate time for OP. 

This is a timing issue, and I'm hoping that if OP explains that once she and dad have had time to cool off, the men in her family will respect it and back off a bit. "

She claimed not to when I talked to her about this back in January. That was about all she said about it. I don't know if she really does or not, because she won't tell me why she won't go.

&gt; I also suggest you two go to counseling to try to work through the serious communication issue, and especially if she has a phobia and/or anxiety towards doctors

Man, yeah, I know. She's said she wants to work on her communication a lot before, usually when I'm upset with her about it, but it's never gone anywhere. I've suggested counselling a few times but I don't think she's taken it seriously.

We had a big blowup over something the other day and it came up again but nothing since. Maybe I should bring it up again, I guess. It's just so hard to talk to her about anything. Even suggesting counselling leads to the same patterns, so I dunno.

"While it's true that a couple should make a house a home *together* when they cohabitate, there are situations when one partner is significantly more invested in the house than the other, just like this. The mortgage is in his name, the renovations aren't just to make it ""homey"" these are projects that directly add value to his home. Furniture, decor, arrangement, organization, simple paint jobs, all of those should be a joint effort. But renovations are something that can and will add value to his investment, he should have the final say in those matters as the homeowner. 


To be blunt, you two have only been together for a year. There is no guarantee that the relationship will still exist by the time he's ready to resell. I'd recommend changing your perspective on this. For example, stop saying you're paying the mortgage, you're paying rent to him which he uses to pay the mortgage. If you two break up and you move out then you get 0% of that money back, just like rent. On the flip side, you shouldn't be expected to contribute any money to the renovations either, he's the only one getting a return on this investment, he's the only one paying towards it. 


Later, if/when you two are ready to buy a new house together, you can make these decisions as a couple because you are both on the mortgage (presumably married, I wouldn't recommend buying a house together if you weren't) and equally invested in the property. "
"Don't send him the letter. This is someone who was okay with outing you by pretending to be concerned about your social life. Also, because you're not completely out, the letter is evidence. It would give him ammo to learn that you've been hurt. He already put you in a vulnerable state, saw you were uncomfortable and kept pushing. He's not going to care, he'll just remind you of the pain next time. This time, the audience luckily were friends. He'll do the same at a work event or a social setting with more strangers. 

Is there perhaps an LGBT club near you? A place where you can meet more people who are out and proud? They could perhaps help you with learning to stand up for yourself in awkward situations. It would help you to see how others handle themselves and give you a li'l confidence boost. 

Next time someone keeps talking about something you don't want to discuss, it's okay to say: ""That subject is not up for discussion."" and to deliberately walk away. Also can be used:

""That's rude."" 

""Sorry, i keep my personal life private."" 

""I rather would not talk about that.""

""Why would you say that?""

It's not helpful for me if you just have a feeling, but if you have concrete specific examples, I'm glad you can raise them.""


Wow. This is completely fucked up on your BF. Instead of (a) letting her know that she has crossed boundaries and (b) firing her, he has (c) allowed her to believe he respects and believes her warped views and (d) continued to allow her access to his home, which you've admitted isn't necessary to her job.

"I had a friend of mine take care of my hamster once. Our holidays overlapped one day, so I gave her a key to my appartment (two doors over from hers). She ""forgot"" to put him back in my appartment before she left for her own holiday. My hamster was in her appartment for three days, without me knowing how much food/water he had, before I was able to get a key from a friend of hers. 

She had been a good friend up until then. She has no pets of her own. So I decided to stay friends, but to never let her take care of any of my stuff ever again. Not just pets, I also made a mental note not to lend her anything remotely expensive or precious of mine. 

I now ask anyone taking care of my pets to send me a daily picture.

But all I'm seeing in this post is your concern for yourself, and no effort to understand why your friends might prefer homeschooling to attending public school. Instead you write them both off as slackers, which makes me wonder how supportive you usually are of them.

Long story short, you're waaaay out of line for trying to persuade them both to stay for your comfort. At some point you're going to need to swallow your own insecurity and learn how to talk to people, because you can't rely on two people to shield you from being friendless. That's on you."

When you get married, amplify all these things by 100x. There are millions of other people out there that will give you the love and attention you deserve. Maybe going back home might be an option for you too.

"&gt;I feel very disrespectful

Hah - truth in typos. Look, you think her boss is a douche - fair enough, so are a lot of bosses. But very little of your post is actually about her job, and is instead a bunch of whining and jealousy.

* It's not a real job (hence the ""disrespectful"" freudian slip - do you think dissing your fiancee's life choices is endearing you to her?)
* He's younger than you
* Pays her more than you earn
* Hate that he can pay for things when he's met you

etc. Look, either you trust her or you don't. And don't come back with ""I trust her, I just don't trust him"". Horseshit. If you trust her, he can be coming at her with guns blazing and she wouldn't give a shit.

Honestly, from what you've written, she's got a boss who pays her a good salary, pays for you both when you've met him, and is offering to fly you out *regularly* to see your fiancee when she's away. He sounds like a stand up guy! Or, if you want the cynical version, playing this game a hell of a lot smarter than you are.

Either he's genuinely a nice person, and you're a whiny child who your fiancee will get sick of. OR he's a scheming manipulator who's trying to get in your fiancee's pants...and you're a whiny child who your fiancee will get sick of. So be supportive, be glad she's doing so well for herself, and stop giving in to your ego. Otherwise you'll push her away, he may or make not make a move, and you'll feel all self righteous that ""he was always trying to steal her from me"" while having no self-awareness that you made it **so fucking easy for him**. Grow up and make yourself the person she wants to be with - seems like it's your battle to lose.

Oh, and don't give her an ultimatum - unless there's anything clearly untoward going on with them, you're basically telling her ""give up on your dream job because I'm paranoid and want you to be less successful than me"". That won't end well for you."

"I'm surprised by a lot of these comments. Assault is a big deal. If the cousin knowingly invited both the perpetrator and victim(s) of the assault to a group chat, then she was playing with fire and damn well deserved to get burnt. No doubt the pregnant cousin wanted OP to sweep the whole issue under the rug and just bottle up the pain and injustice. Instead, OP pointed out how fucking rude and inappropriate it is. 

You know what, good on you OP. If you didn't take a stand now, then people would probably say ""oh but you were fine talking to such-and-such that other time! I thought it was all forgotten now!"" It's not surprising that your cousin is pissed off about the timing, but then given she invited the person who assaulted you, she's probably an enabler and would've been pissed off anyway.

Edit: Also see OP's comment about the type of assault. If it's what it sounds like, then no one in the family should still be speaking to that person, let alone celebrating with them."

I think you need to be honest with yourself. If you don't want to go, that's fine.

OTOH, 2 months is plenty of time if you wanted to make it. You just don't want to. Especially since it's a friday night at 6, school as an excuse is out, and 2 months out is enough time to get time off.

You just don't want to go.I don't blame you. That said, unless you actively dislike him, I'd go. There's a difference between not close and disliked. One night on a friday isn't that big of a sacrifice."

This is so out of touch with reality. It's not like she instantly forgave and forgot what you did and this friend magically made her angry again. She discussed the situation with a friend for outside perspective and it stirred up her emotions again. Honestly I can't imagine describing this to a friend of mine and them not having a similar adverse reaction so putting all of the blame on this guy instead of looking at your own actions won't get you very far."

"I'm going to sidestep the kids thing, because that might not actually be quite as relevant to your friend's perspective as others seem to think.

My best bet is that, as a regular group get together, your friend sees game night as Standing Plans for everyone involved. Everyone regularly attends. Everyone should be reasonably accommodated. You put up with their schedules and their children, so if the time doesn't seem to be working for you, of course she should return the favor and see if they could try to reschedule if a member of the group is having frequent conflicts.

That being said, my advice is still roughly the same: ""Thanks for offering to reschedule, that's really thoughtful! The regular time isn't actually a problem for us, though. We love game night when we come, but we're sorry that we can't make it a weekly commitment anymore."" "

Tell him to talk to other people and do some deep thinking about why he thinks he's entitled to some of that money. Remain adamant that you are keeping it but ask him to really look around and reconsider what he's asking you.

Money makes people do stupid things. It sounds like he got swept up in a fantasy where he would be able to pay off a whole bunch of debt and now he feels like you're taking that away from him - what he's doing is wrong, but if he has a few days to come down from that high, he might end up feeling embarrassed and realize that he doesn't get any of it.

If he doesn't reach that conclusion after a week or two, tell him you're not discussing it further and he needs to drop it."
yes! it is for me! the weight loss thus far is of my own volition and I would continue even if we did break up. Just hoping to hear from some people who have been in similar situations.
"Just listen to your gut and don't let yourself be talked into anything you don't want to do, no matter what they say you ""promised"" to do while high."
"Yah, and/or for instance, I have a mobile deposit app on my phone, just endorse the check, snap a photo of front and back, and they drop it right into my account, I just have to hang onto it for 30 days in case something goes wrong.  So essentially that check could have technically already been cashed. 

Either way, super, super easy to find out that it wasn't his check and he wasn't the intended recipient."
The other benefit of putting the money into an IRA or whatever similar long-term investments is that she can still share the money with her beloved Skylar if they end up spending the rest of their lives together. And she can spend it on herself and her future family if not.
"Honestly, when you're 16, relationships shouldn't be a lot of work. They should be fun and not full of drama. I'm not trying to minimize the feelings you have for your BF - they are real. But when you recognize that things aren't working out, this is the age where you should learn good relationship skills, like learning to break up honorably. It still hurts to break up, but when you behave with integrity, the healing process is better."
"It might also be worth mentioning to your doctor the next time you go. Or to make an appointment to talk about it. 

If you feel that bad and are bleeding that much, there may be something they can do to help. "
"My two questions for you would be:
- How is your ability to communicate, compromise and resolve conflict in testing situations?
- Do your goals (short and long-term) and expectations towards this marriage align? 


I say this as someone who married my husband after 5 months. We met while travelling and were in each others pockets 24 /7 for 2 months. For me, the length of time wasn't as relevant as what we experienced together as a couple. We were (still are) an excellent team and battled the most high stress situations with ease. He had to leave for visa reasons but we reunited one month later on his own turf and introduced me to his family which was a whole new experience but equally amazing.

We ended up getting married for visa reasons shortly after but I was very clear to him that in one year's time, we would reassess our marriage and decide if we wanted to continue. So that first year was kind of like a trial-marriage and then on our 1st year anniversary we ""said our vows"" to each other again as a symbol of lifelong commitment. I think this was really important for us to actively choose to be together no strings attached, as opposed to being married cause we had to. We wanted to get rid of that burden.

In your post it seems you've only been together in one environment (his) and that's one reservation I'd have about your decision. I'd highly recommend having him visit your family, in your country beforehand. People change when they're no longer in their comfort zone and I think it's important you test that. Also have you been a holiday together yet? Definitely do so."

"I don't know about divorce-worthy but this is definitely separate finances and go to counselling worthy. He has admitted to deceiving you multiple times throughout the duration of your relationship. 

Now, surely you didn't fall in love with him because he had a car, or lived with his brother, or went to the gym. But he absolutely pulled one over on you by making himself out to be someone he is not. People are allowed to have dealbreakers. He was dishonest with you about this stuff time and time again. That's a pretty sick level of deception. 

As far as the gifts and visas, he's shown that he will lie to you about stuff that is important to you. He will lie to cover his ass when it means a financial burden for you. That's not a partner. That's not someone you can rely on to have your best interests at heart. He's clearly shown you that he gets what he wants by any means necessary. I think it's fair to tell him that your trust has been severely damaged and that the burden is on him to prove he is trustworthy and honest.

Also, no more of this playing the victim shit. You didn't throw anything in his face. You gave an example of a time when his lies weren't harmless during a discussion about his lies being harmless.

Did he even apologize for that? He should be the one paying you back for expenses you lost there."
"Indeed. There are two ways to get rid of a crush:

1. Find out something heinous and disgusting about them that kills any attraction stone dead.

2. Avoid them as much as possible until the crush passes

Unless she's looking to find some kind of Saw-like dungeon that the husband has set up in his garage, evidently she's not looking to stop her crush anytime soon."
"Also, you don't keep an ex's nudes. That's so gross."
"Your husband is right that this sounds pretty weird. 

Was he invited to come babysit too?"
"And wouldn't you know it, 9 is a prime age to start developing an eating disorder. Do not expose your daughter to someone who is actively trying to destroy her healthy relationship with food. As the kids here like to say, head over to r/JUSTNOMIL for advice and support in setting firm boundaries between your MIL and your kids."
Why not go? Life is short. Have some fun with your wife and make some gay friends.
"Or he could just say ""No need. It's over."" Then block and move on. "
"I'm going to be honest... My mom and dad have such a soft spot for her because she had a pretty tough time before she came to live with us, and also because she's the ""youngest."" They were pretty lenient with me as well, but they really baby her a lot. They're generally just like ""oh she's not doing drugs or breaking the law."""
"Did she meet him in the gym? What do you mean by all over him? 


If she's denying it then that's a bad sign, probably cheating/emotional cheating unfortunately."

Something tells me everything in your post is exactly how your BF wants it.
"You have preconceived ideas about what love, marriage, and adulthood are supposed to be. And they're all pretty immature and out of touch. 

I hear you being afraid of losing your youth, becoming boring, and locked down with someone who is no longer interesting. None of that happens because of marriage. Usually that happens as people get a bit older, get into the routines of their careers and lives, and their values change. I remember at 23 I would have been *horrified* choosing sleep over sex, or having only Mom friends, or not being beautiful and thin anymore. 

Reality is: I'm 30, been married 5 years, had two kids. I'm not as young and fun and spontaneous and thin as I used to be. That sucks in its own way, but guess what? When I was 23 I was too broke and insecure to do most of the things I dreamed about. With my husband, I've crossed off like every bucket list item I've ever had. And we continue to create new ones. 

I've traded the latest trends for awesome vacations I could never afford as a broke 23 year old student, dating jerks who were more concerned about their band than building a life worth living. 

I've gained a few pounds, but I've also gained a life partner that encourages me to do literally whatever crazy idea comes into my head. *'Oh you want to be a trapeze artist? Cool let's sit down and come up with a plan to make that happen....'* he will literally encourage, consider, fund, sacrifice, and make happen anything I want or we want or our kids want. 

We decided to move internationally because we wanted to travel. We ended up having kids right away, and REALLY close together (haha SURPRISE) so we did this as a family. We didn't want having kids to hold us back. We took a job, moved across the world, and now we can afford to travel to a couple new countries every year. We hope to relocate to Korea next year. In 3 years, I project we will have $100k in the bank and I'd like to move to Europe. 

We've been to 10 countries together so far. Our kids have been with us to every single one and we have amazing memories as a family. Again, I'm not as young and thin and trendy as I was at 23, but I'm still getting the most out of life and raising two awesome people who can share those experiences. 


She won't be young and thin and perky and tight and trendy forever. Can you deal with that? Eventually your lives will slow down and your priorities will change, and you may not be as outgoing or exciting as you once were as you have responsibilities that cause your priorities to change. 

My husband is bearded and tattooed, my hair has been many colors of the rainbow, I dress weird, and I also drive my kids to ballet lessons and soccer class like a damn suburban housewife lol. 

You can be whoever you want to be. Don't let anyone or anything else define you!"
"I think the problem is ""he did that and called it sleep training"". Not ""sleep training is bad""."
"This is one of the craziest things I've read on the subreddit.

I actually think you're making too little a deal over it.

He is using food as a way to manipulate you and others into doing things his way.

He's being very controlling over not allowing you to have your party your way, order your own food, forcing you to give him a ""food tax"" and dictating where you eat.

This is not just a ""quirk""."
I'm glad you're going. Bleeding through a pad in a half hour is an emergency. I'm surprised no one has advised you on that. I also have cysts on my ovaries so I understand how bad the pain can get. Good luck hon! Rest up and feel better. 
"I think this confirms the really good point in the comment above. He thinks of you as his opponent. He thought the therapist was taking your side, meaning he thought therapy was you versus him. Therapy should be a way to work together to solve problems, not a battle of who's right and who's wrong. He has to change this attitude to fix your relationship. "
Don't get entangled in that clusterfuck. He's clearly not making good choices right now and you have your own life to live. 
"As an acts of service person, those sorts of things really wouldn't come across as resonant for me because they don't fall into the category of ""helpful""

Instead, things like setting the table, or coming back after work with a favorite drink to have with/before/after dinner, or a surprise room cleaning would make me feel really cared for.

At some level, it's a mix of giving the gift of your time plus doing something concrete that shows you're playing attention to the person's needs/wants"
Yes!!!! Do NOT go to your boss first. It'll make you look bad. I would go to the owner and apologize profusely and for sure tell him you are so embarrassed of their behaviour. I bet he will appreciate you coming to him and apologizing. 
"Make sure you and your wife are on the same page regarding Theresa.  In general, it's best to have the blood relative do the talking.  It's a sensitive subject, and if you're the one to bring it up, the anger is likely to be shifted to you.

What kind of socially inept narcissist tries to dye someone else's young child's hair without clearing it with the parents first? This girl has no boundaries and no respect. She sounds like a nightmare to try to coparent with.

"Idk man, 2 months notice for 1 day should be enough to request off. Not saying you have to be in the wedding, but it shouldn't be **that** big of an inconvenience just to show up. "
"This is the harsh truth- yes, it may be hard to read, but sometimes a kick in the pants like this is needed to get your life together. 

You're absolutely right- as women, we're often told to be patient, not rock the boat, accept what we get. But that's all bullshit, and a recipe to be treated like a doormat. "
"Thank you, I kind of realized on day two what had happened but I was just hopeful that it wasn't the case and he'd explain why he ignored me, but that's not going to happen. I may go the route of asking mutual friends if they can get the things for me, even if he did let me come to collect my things in not sure I even want to see him at this point because I'm so hurt by how he did this."
"&gt; I know I look bad here

Then you should know exactly where your husband is coming from. If a bunch of online strangers are sketched out by this, of course your husband is going to be furious. 

In fact, the very post you've made sheds light on how wrong you might know this is. If it were a silly misunderstanding or you had absolutely no hesitations towards it, then why bother spending the time to go to Reddit -- you could easily resolve this with your husband and your boss. 

I....I think you're looking for ammo. For validation that what you're doing isn't as bad as it looks. But you know it looks bad, which begs the question: If *we* think it looks bad, if *you* thinks it looks bad, if *your husband* thinks it looks bad -- why are you insistent on following through with it?

You know, ducks, quacking, and walking. 

I think you have an opportunity to make the right decision for you and your husband here :)"
"150 per month is SO LOW for 3 people. I spend 120 per month and I love alone in a 1 bedroom. 

If annoying your roommates is worth the 20$ per month you're gonna save, go for it. But the fight doesn't seem worth it to me . "
"Nope. Your boyfriend is an idiot -- not to mention has absolutely no right to criticize your weight 4 months into dating. It's not like you put on 20 lbs since you met. 

Assuming you don't want to dump him (I would) I think it's a little late to call him out on that. But be ready -- you can bet your ass this won't be the last time he makes some remark about your perfectly normal amount of weight. Then you tell him off, and let him know that if he's not happy with your body, then he's in luck because that's the last he gets to see of it. "
"&gt;I really don't want to lose my closest friend that has helped me so much in meeting new people and advancing at work and showing me around town.

i understand that he's done alot for you in the past, but the fact remains this close friend wanted to AND ACTIVELY TRIED to fuck your teenage sister.

i sense that you are not willing to do anything about this as far as alerting anyone about what he did, so my advice to you is to let him know what you found out, that you want nothing more to do with him, and if he tries to put your job in jeopardy you will alert his family to what took place."
"You have to learn how to stand up for yourself. This is your home, and you have every right to be comfortable in it. You have to fight for your comfort. Her awkwardness is not your problem. Don't allow her to break the rules just because she's awkward. And honestly, she might be a lot more comfortable if her father is kept away. It sounds like he might be abusive."
"Your parents are abusive. They received illicit images taken without your consent and they're attempting to emotionally manipulate you into doing what they want. Go to University. Your parents aren't looking out for your best interest. They're looking to control you.

I would write them a letter telling them that you have suffered at the hands of abuse and their response was to continue that abuse by making you choose between an education and a good life and your family. Finish out by telling them that you can't make decisions based on emotional manipulation and that you will make decisions based on what is best for your future. Mention that you hope they will support you but if should they decide to continue with this it won't change your mind.

You're right that your relationship just took a huge hit because your parents are doing this. The middle ground here is to do what is best for you but don't do it in a way that says ""Fuck you I do what I want"". Do it in a way that says ""I am going to make decisions based on whats best for me"". Hopefully they chill out and realize they aren't doing the same."
"I disagree on the do-over. He rolled his eyes when he made his new girlfriend cry. If she had minimized it or laughed it off, maybe he'd get another chance. But she made it clear it hurt her and he blew her off as easily offended."
"What if she had replied ""Oh Darling, I feel the same! Let's meet tonight at the hotel and see what happens!"" Would your husband have said ""Oh, no no no, I'm so sorry, this was a mistake. I just wanted to see if I still had it, I didn't mean to imply that I was really in love with you! I'm happily married!"" Or do you think he would have been with her?

"Yes, or imagine this scenario... he has a son and he ends up being gay or something like that. Would he still be disappointed because he didn't have a ""manly"" enough son?

"So, you definitely can't say for sure that you got it from her. Even if she has a positive test, you may have given it to her unwittingly."
TIL competitive alcoholism is a thing.
"This. Maybe she loves you and is so bound by her faith that she thinks she can get around it by keeping you as her PG-13 companion. Maybe she absolutely adores the attention you give her and doesn't want to lose/share that until she finds someone that she wants. Either way you need to shut this shit down. 

I think you need to be up front here. Direct communication. Something along the lines of ""____, I have deep feelings for you. I adore you, and I want to be with you, I want to have a romantic relationship with you. But if you don't want this, then I can accept that, but I will not accept you becoming a spiteful jealous individual when I pursue elsewhere, I will not accept you talking so badly about the people I see. If you want to be with me, then be with me. I think we could be really happy together. But if you don't, you need to stop behaving this way when I look elsewhere, otherwise we can no longer be friends, because even if marriage or a romantic relationship is not what you want in life, it is what I want. """
Dude got bite by some crazy chick and you can see the marks days later? The crazy chick was then taken away by the police. I'd personally take him at his word on this one. No one wants to get bit that way. I'd also make it a deal breaker for him that if he ever gets that drunk again then it's over.

"Yeah, when both partners consent. But she's been crying and pushing him away and he STILL is so tone deaf he keeps pushing it. It's gross."
"Pretty much this. OP, you aren't giving an ultimatum. You delayed your goals for his benefit. He said he'd be ready in X years. He's not ready. He may never BE ready.

He keeps pushing the goalposts on you, and you keep following along. 

Put another way, you've postponed your goals for the good of the relationship. He hasn't.

It's a pity you had to wait so long. :( I'm sorry, Op.

"A panty fetish is not a major issue. Stealing his sister-in-law's panties to satisfy it, however, is a very big deal."
"Just one thing to add, if this dude actually has cancer and has undergone ANY radiation therapy or chemo, even oral chemotherapies, he would have been told to ALWAYS use a condom because the drugs can be carried in sperm and can have long term lasting side effects on women, up to and including infertility. "
right? I'm reading through this thinking OP needs a clue by four to the head. He has been leaving his fiancee high and fucking dry on this instead of being her partner. 
"I mean, she grew up with a mom who constantly overspent and drove her family to the brink of poverty and her parents probably argued about money all the time, so it makes sense that she's always had money-related anxiety. Anyone would, and at least she's gone the opposite way of being very responsible . . . I agree that therapy would be a great idea. I'm guessing there is more to unpack in this family dynamic than just money stuff. "
"It sounds like the mom might already know the dad is an ass...

&gt; (he doesn't live with us) "
"Is he negging you? I just found out about this term recently and I guess it's some method guys use to mess girls up and keep them under their thumb or something. I'm not entirely sure if I understand ""negging"" 100%, but it seems like the idea is to keep you questioning your own beauty and worth to manipulate you somehow. Anyway I'm certainly no expert but it might be worth looking into.

Whether it's intentional negging or unintentional, this guy is putting you down. Constantly. The reality is that a 21 year old lady at 125 pounds? Is probably what most guys dream about. Find someone who lifts you up. I finally did and oh my gosh it is the best feeling in the whole world.

About your mom... That's weird. But the standards of what was acceptable in her day have changed. Don't accept the negging just cause mom would. "
This is probably good insight into why his wife left him
"I'm feel like your insistence of paying the depreciated value is screaming to everyone ""this isn't the first thing my dog has ruined something of mine or my roommates!"" And her not budging on you owe me $950 is a stand against you and your dog who desperately needs to be crated and in obedience classes. 

It's that or you feel like she should have said ""no, it's fine. Don't worry about it! Dogs will be dogs!"" And you're mad that your actions have consequences. "
"Reading his post, it kind of sounded like she expects him to pay for the trip. OP, is that the case? Maybe that's why she's pushing it. Either way, I would tell her no."
Your ideal guy is a cheater? You need to raise your standards a bit.
Just be honest and say that you like to shower with him sometimes but other time you just want alone time. I had that talk with my boyfriend when we moved in together and it was no big deal. 
"Okay, so to summarize, your friend has self esteem issues, sees you as direct competition, has excluded you from group events because of it, has a crush on your husband that she has already acted on, and now wants to continue spending time with you *and your husband.* That's a hard NOPE for me. If you must remain friends with her, do so on your own. See how she responds to that. My guess will be with disappointment and passive aggression. Besides, why subject your husband to unwanted touching and flirting? "
"""What do you do when you're not working?""

Helicopter is an understatement. He is 12 and has never spent one night with either grandparent. She is also a very selfish person.
"""Fiance, lets talk. I never, ever want kids. I will not parent a child.""

You two are not compatible and should **not** be getting married."
"So what, are you expecting them to just sit quietly side by side?

I get where you are coming from, but it's illogical. They love each other, they are consenting adults, and yes, maybe they will bang, and it's gross, but I honestly don't know what to tell you other than ""deal with it"", since that's the only option you have...."
Listen hard to this lady.
"If she wants to break up, it is no longer your concern if she gets hurt.  Obviously, she doesn't care about hurting you, so why bother?

You need to get over these feelings, or you are going to be the doormat she keeps running back to after having her heart broken over and over."
"It sounds like your brother is more conservative. It's not a surprise that someone with conservative values would disapprove of his sister having a child out of wedlock, living with her parents, and stripping. 

I know that sounds judgmental- it's because it is. That entire conservative mindset is about judging other people for not living up to their standards. 

So... where do you go from here? Well, changing other people is a difficult proposition. I doubt you're going to get him to stop having conservative viewpoints that your lifestyle doesn't mesh with. I think in your shoes I would stop trying to have a close relationship with him and instead have the kind of removed relationship you have with more distant family members with conservative values. I have highly religious, homophobic in-laws that I do the equivalent of talking about the weather with at Thanksgiving and I don't really have any contact with them outside of that.

It's unfortunate that that's what's happened to your relationship with your brother, but I really cannot see you changing his value system, so it's just deciding how to cope with him being a part of your family going forward."
That's why u/drama_throw_away said *progression*. First a sarcastic response. Then a firm statement. Then if it happens a third time an ultimatum.
Not sure. When we had our meeting she named the COO and one other person as the other people who don't wash their hands (according to her) but the COO said she hadn't talked to him about it and the other guy quit last week. She's talking to everyone about how it's disgusting and I've heard her discussing loudly the COO not washing his hands but I don't know what she's saying to people in private. I feel singled out but I think she could be singling others out like the guy that quit to go to coding camp.
"I mean...  from your description, your mother was like...200% in the wrong here.  She let her prejudices run away with her, and gave unwanted, unwarranted, and unsolicited (not to mention incorrect) advice to someone who didn't want it.  Even if she'd been *right* about the photo shoot (and she's not), if you give someone your advice when they didn't ask, and they get upset, that's *your* fault.

So...

&gt; She's asking me to fix the conflict but I don't know where to start.

Only she can fix this.  And she can fix it by recognising that she fucked up. 

&gt; My mother just now realized that this means not talking to my nephew either. 

As long as your mother's only concern is the nephew, not her daughter, then she's not going to make any progress mending fences, and frankly, doesn't deserve to either.  The issue here isn't that she's not going to see her daughter, it's that she was wrong to give her opinion about what a successful adult is choosing to do with their lives.

(I mean, she's also wrong in her views about sex, sexuality, suggestive photos and motherhood, but really, that's the *least* of the problems here.  The biggest issue is her bizarre misconception that your sister's choice to do the photoshoot involve people other than your sister and potentially her partner, if applicable.)

Getting involved in family drama like this is usually a bad idea at the best of times, but in this case all you can do is tell your mother that this is her mess to fix.  You can't force her to realise that she fucked up, and you can't force her to apologise, and nothing *else* is going to fix this."
"That is a self-esteem issue. Even if you looked worse than Quasimodo, you still deserve to be treated with the respect you deserve. there are millions of people around you. You Will be loved again.

"You're making excuses for the dude who drugged you without your consent, seemingly for the purpose of fucking you. He just didn't succeed when you were actually fucked up on Molly. And now your boyfriend is conspiring with him to have a threesome. Great. Wake the fuck up. Neither of these people respect you. How you could even be considering this is so beyond insane. "
Buy her some nice things and tell her you'd think she would look hot/sexy/cute in this. Do it with a smile and don't frame it where you think she looks unattractive now. Buy yourself some cute dude underwear as well and dress up for her too. 
"Unfortunately I haven't been able to locate him. Last anyone saw of him was in about 2001. Like I wish I could contact him for five seconds just to tell him I know the truth now and never held any of it against him. Don't even need a relationship, just wish I could tell him I love him unconditionally and he was never replaced in my heart."
"Also I feel the need to mention that he said he didn't know anyone there/isn't close to her family

/u/WeebleWobs - Dude, put the phone down and socialize. You'll never get close to/get to know anyone if you're on your phone when they're around. It's pretty rude to be at a family gathering and not to try to get to know people."
"My concern with this is that the last book in the series, *In the Realm of the Gods*, directly mentions sex, or the then-teenage (and underage, by modern standards) Daine mentions possibly having sex, or expecting sex, with or from a much-older adult man. 

If the reader in this scenario is an 11 year old girl, and has this level of unhealthy obsession, then it's best *not* to introduce her to books with explicit mentions of sex - and especially not an underage girl seriously discussing having sex with a man much older than her.

That scene with Daine proved controversial even among Pierce's other readers. Pierce has come out and said, ""well, the books are set in the medieval ages, and women got married to older men as minors""...but if this girl reads them, given her thinking Harry Potter is real, she probably won't be able to tell the difference.

Same goes for /u/QueenoftheHamburgers's suggestion of Aly Cooper (as an edit, she said Bekka Cooper, but I still want to address this). I know that there is at least one direct sex scene between Aly and another male character in the series.

Likewise, Pierce also directly mentioned that *Trickster's Choice* would've started Aly Cooper off at 13 years old, but her publishers made her change Aly's age to 16. (Presumably due to said male character courting Aly for sex from the start of the books onwards, as per Pierce herself.)

There is also at least one explicit mention in the books (as a whole, spanning Pierce's works) of ""a guy (knight) being expected or thought he would need to rape women and knock them up to even have a child"".

From Pierce's website:

&gt; ""...If [rape] were truly about sex, people wouldn't rape tiny children and old people. It‚Äôs about power, violence, humiliation, and rage. No power can protect people from that...""

Also, from the Alanna (""Song of the Lioness"") series, there is mention / depiction of rape:

&gt; Some time after [Ralon of Malven] had left the palace he attempted to rape Anala, a village girl from Eldorne, the fief neighboring Malven. Anala's maid threw acid in his face and thereby caused purple scars on Ralon's face. As a result he also lost an eye. After this incident he was disinherited.

Tamora Pierce definitely doesn't shy away from sex or rape, or mentions of sex or rape, in her books, which makes me think (also given it's usually underage or teenage girls having sex) that these books are not appropriate for this situation.

As an edit, as I see I got downvoted, so I edited in more information to illustrate my point.

From the TV Tropes page on Pierce's books:

&gt; Squick: Aly and [redacted], for some people. Daine and [redacted], for others. 14 year age gap and relative social status for the latter is often quoted as the reason."
"She's not overreacting because next time the child runs across the street it might not be a dead end street. Also, no, you have no right to tell her how to discipline her child. "
"Exactly this and worse, OP, he will conpletely throw you under the bus and all over the side of the bus, all everywhere,  so you need to tell him exactly what you told us word for word and you need to do this immediately!!"
"If you won't even enjoy going to the wedding, it seems obvious this is an event to skip. Eventually you'll have to be around each other, but making this event the occasion isn't necessary."
"&gt; I'm also worried that it'll destroy my wife's relation with her. My wife doesn't have very many close friends

First of all, you aren't the one destroying your wife's relationship with Alice. Alice is the one doing that by acting inappropriately around you.  Second, as few friends as your wife has, which do you think she cares more about, her relationship with you or with a friend?

Tell your wife that Alice has been making you uncomfortable lately.  She might not believe you at first, but you will have at least given her a warning to be on the lookout for signs. When she sees them, it will be her decision to make."
"Since your sister is willing to let her work go for free she should consider using a PWYW (Pay What You Want) pricing strategy.

The beauty of this is that she doesn't have to set pricing, ever... The customers decide what to pay.

She should charge a nominal fee for s&amp;h, like the $3 she has been charging as it will cover postage, packing material/envelopes as well as her time in sending the items out.

She can also ask her customers for suggestions or even donations of fabric. Involving her customers in her product on social media is a great way to get people interested and get the word out there... Plus if she is using their ideas they are going to want to buy that and will probably pay more because she listened to them and made a product that they both wanted and were involved in.

You and/or she may want to google 'pay what you want' for more information and ideas. 

From what you said about your sister I think that this pricing strategy might be fun for her and when people pay more for items that they really like it will be both a boost to her confidence as well."
"""I can't leave him""

The fuck you can't. Girl,  leaving him is the first thing you should do. Go to a shelter.  Run.  You should not be worth this creepy stalker.  Seriously, what he did is serial killer level nutty."
"Dude, an apology is not what she wants. She wants you to not spend time with an alcoholic who will probably encourage you to drink given your history of problems with alcohol and his continuing alcoholism. She hates him because she considers him to be an enabler and encourager and a major part of your history's ""drinking lifestyle"". He is a risk to your sobriety.

If he wants any chance of gaining her favor, he needs to convince her that you and him are friends in a cool wholesome ""sober lifestyle"" with actions and not words. This means hanging out with you and making plans with you while *completely sober*, and demonstrating that he can refrain from being a terrible influence."
"Oh god... I absolutely loathe being a gatekeeper or ""identity police,"" which is why I try very hard to take what she says at face value. But it does increasingly seem that she thinks these labels (bisexual, trans, mental illness, etc) are just cool accessories she can tack onto herself. When she was in middle school she told everyone that she had severe clinical depression and bipolar disorder. My mom overheard the rumors and took her to a therapist, who said she didn't have either, but she kept telling people that because a singer she liked had once talked about having depression/bipolar and she thought it was cool. 

As far as I'm concerned... I also believe that you'd need gender dysphoria in order to be transgender. Maybe not body dysmorphia, but how would you even know you were transgender if you didn't have the feeling that your brain sex didn't match your physical sex? But I also know that some people believe that ""trans"" is more of an umbrella term for whoever feels comfortable using that label, and I suppose Emily thinks so as well. I think this chain of thought is called ""tucute."" I had to do a lot of research trying to understand most of Emily's angry comments :("
"My go to is to not turn aqay from my computer or remove my hands from keyboard/mouse unless they're talking about work stuff. It sends the 'I'm trying to work here,"" message. 

If she asks you what you're doing over the weekend, say ""nothing."" Even if you've got the spectacular weekend of a lifetime planned. The point is to be boooooring and make her stop asking a question she always gets the same answer to. If she says you should hang out, say ""no thanks."" If she asks why not say ""I don't mix work and pleasure."" 

If she presses the issue you literally have no choice but to say, ""I don't think we should hang out outside of work."" Just rip the bandaid off. "
"So you think your friend lies to every *except* you?

That's like dating someone who's an outspoken misogynist and telling yourself that they respect you, it's just other women that they don't care for.

That's like being friends with people who constantly gossip and talk shit about others and then thinking they don't do the same thing about you when you leave the room.

It's kinda painful to see the mental gymnastics you're doing to convince yourself that your ""friend"" is anywhere near telling the truth. I think u/C1awed pretty much addressed all of the major points as to why it's obvious that your bf is telling the truth and your friend can't be trusted, but I'd like to add that you yourself noted that Rachael has lost all of her friends *except you* because of her lying and manipulation. "
"Don't date men 10 years older than you. This is what he's always wanted, a child and a way to control you, OP. "
I also read it like that. She doesn't want to get married and religion won't permit sex without marriage so she is going to stay a virgin. Or maybe she has major fears and hangup about sex and doesn't want to be married because it leads to sex. She really does want to be OP girlfriend but in their world dating is just a precursor to marriage which then leads to sex and she doesn't want either those. So instead she keeps OP on as a platonic friend and then gets angry when he tries dating.
"This isn't even about his sexual history (edit: which is ALMOST DEFINITELY AT LEAST PARTLY LIES! You intimidated him by sleeping with four men so he made up a bunch of shit 99% probability!) to me? It's about his behaviour *now*? 
&gt;He will ogle girls in public when we're together, or text me saying ""man I love barsluts, they're so hot.""

This is.......................just gross.

&gt;I've tried to talk to him about this but he just dismisses it 

Why do you want to stay with someone who won't have a conversation with you and won't give your feelings proper attention?
"
"&gt; he is abusive to top it off and really bad with money because there shouldn't be credit card debt, overdue car bills and even less back taxes for a couple making over $100K with no kids. 

This. Honestly it sounds like they are both pretty shit with money. 

OP, your husband is abusive. Things might be good for a while, but then you're going to end up in the same abusive pattern again. Separate from him. He has absolutely no incentive to change because he knows you depend on him and he can push you around. He's also not someone you can depend on to support you financially in a non-abusive way. So regardless of what you decide, you're going to need a fulltime job. "

"That's a manipulation tactic to get you to put up with his abuse. Girl you're getting played for a fool. None of this is ok, none of this is normal and none of this is healthy.  You are wasting your time. Get out! Just stay safe while you doing it. This dude is scary."
"And full custody means child support payments, so she might be able to pay someone to help take care of the kid.  Honestly I think OP's inability to get away from her daughter for any meaningful length of time is why she might have the feelings she does for her child."

"My first thought was along the lines that she didn't want to admit that she was terminated, but it does seem awfully timely that it happened at the same time as OP's promotion.  What is the timeline on that, OP? It's a bit vague from the post.

"You guys are onto something, Snapchat is the worst app for messaging someone with short term memory loss."
"You could ask that they pay for an on-campus meal plan, where you only eat at the cafeteria and get single-serve carryout. You could ask for ""meal bucks""-- a lot of meal plans allow you to buy stuff at local businesses, but you'd be limited in what/how much you can buy.  

&gt;my roommate/good friend since high school said that he'd give me $50 a month and split all the food I bought so he could eat (mostly serious, kind of joking). I gave him a solid no because that's a dumb idea. He whined a little bit then implied that he'd just steal food, whereupon I told him that I would lock my food away if he pulled that shit.

You could also move into another living situation where you don't have a an immature jerk for a roommate. Presumably if he's your childhood friend they also know him, and know he's going to eat all your food. 

&gt;they think my roommate will eat my food and I will be unable to stop him.

That is exactly what sounds like will happen. What kind of a jerk is like ""Won't give me what I want? Ok I'll just steal from you then"" He'll get a battery operated screw gun and unscrew the padlock hasp from the door or take the hinges off while you're out. "
"No matter what you do, stay or leave, it will be hard. There is no easy decision here. 

**If you leave:** 

You will find these positive memories behind every corner - things you thought you'd forgotten about. There are snippets of memories that for the entirety of your relationship you may have never considered - an interaction that didn't have any significance at the time - that you will obsess over. It will be painful, and raw, and every morning it will be a battle to get out of your bed. But you will get through it. It will be hard to imagine when you're laying in bed in physical pain from how much you miss the person, but there is a light. Time heals all wounds, and you will find someone who can love you like you deserve to be loved without the added baggage of you having to put in the substantial work to forgive them. There is another person out there for you, even if it doesn't feel like it. 

Dating will feel clunky, clumsy and awkward. You're going to have at least one awkward conversation over dinner or drinks, and you aren't going to mesh with the person. When you get home, you'll lay in your bed and compare everything about that poor, unsuspecting other person to your ex. You will be convinced that there is no one out there for you. But eventually you will find someone who makes you laugh, and makes you feel alive again, and you'll realize that you're thinking about those interactions and forming new memories. And this person won't have burdened you with pain, suffering, trust and intimacy issues. It will be fresh, new, exciting and fulfilling and you will move on. 

**If you stay:**

Your positive memories will be tainted by her infidelity. They don't necessarily have to be - you can cheat while simultaneously having authentic interactions with your SO (you'd be amazed by the cognitive dissonance). You will wonder what else she has lied about. You will have to sit there and watch her untangle why she cheated and manage her inevitably bruised ego while she's trying to take responsibility, she will repeatedly try to hide behind excuses even if she's making an honest effort to be better, because it's really really hard to admit you've done a terrible thing. She will come to you for comfort for the pain she has caused you. Meanwhile, you'll be trying to repair yourself. You will feel fragile and insecure all of the time for a long time, and you won't be completely sure if you can trust her. What you need from her might ultimately grate on her, and if she uses fights as an excuse to cheat, this could absolutely lead her to cheat again. 

But if she accepts what she did, and she shows true remorse, I believe you can still have a beautiful life. You now know something about her that you didn't know before. It's ugly and its twisted but it helps shed a light on who she is as a person. This is a thing she was trying to conceal from herself as well as you. If she accepts that ""cheater"" is a part of her identity, she can take measures to not be a cheater anymore. If you accept that ""cheater"" is a part of her identity, you are seeing her as a multidimensional person with deep flaws that is *still* lovable. I want to be clear, though: you are never under any obligation to love a person for everything they are. Cheating is a dealbreaker for most people, and it should be. Cheaters almost always repeat offend unless they have reached rock bottom and been forced to change - even then, many don't. 

No matter what you do, you have hardship ahead of you. Just try and take care of yourself.

"""A year ago I agreed to move closer to her family to save the marriage.'

"""Lover"" may have meant ""someone I love deeply"" a very long time ago. These days, it absolutely means, ""we are having sex"". ""Making love"" is a polite way of saying, ""we bonked like rabbits"". 

&gt; she thinks that ""they knew what she meant""

They either think you two are having sex because she used a word that implies a sexual relationship, or they think your girlfriend is an idiot for using a word that implies a sexual relationship to refer to your non-sexual relationship.

You can't just take a word back to it's original definition just because you've decided to. Words are about common language, and everyone agreeing on the meaning. Your girlfriend can't just say ""lover"" and assume the other person *knew* she meant it in the original sense of the word.  "

"She's almost certainly normalized the dysfunction. A therapist will help her see that the situation is far from normal. A therapist will help her to set boundaries with her family, and hold to them. A therapist will help her grow.

"I'm a smart lady who likes bad tv. It calms my anxiety to watch shows that are pure entertainment and don't require me to invest emotionally. Also, it's fun to watch people behave badly. Laughing over these shows with friends is one of life's joys. Liking silly shows doesn't make me less smart, and if my boyfriend implied that it did, we'd have words. 

Is there a way for you to frame this for yourself so that you don't have contempt for her? It's not her job to like only the things that you approve of. It's your job to get okay with this or break things off. 

That said, do you think you're fixating on this because there's a bigger problem? Do you feel like you have less to talk about than you used to? Are you worried about her mental health, if she's suddenly decided to spend time watching tv, to the exclusion of all else? "
"You should sit your mom down and let her know that this is really affecting your education and your childhood. Don't just tell her ""I don't want to move anymore"", tell her that she is making life extremely difficult for her own child, that you feel stressed and can't keep up in school because she's not letting you have a proper education. Write her a letter if it's easier. The point is to wake her up to the fact that she's not just inconveniencing you (which she doesn't seem to care about) but she is actually hurting you. This should jumpstart her mothering instincts and make her realize that her lifestyle choices are affecting you and your future"

"&gt;My campus caps us at 20 hours a week, so no matter how much I work I can only get paid for 20 hours. For the student instructing I am spending 4.5 hours a week in meetings which is really cutting into my research time. In addition, **I am ending up working like 30 hours a week in total which is unfortunate to work 10 hours and not get paid for them**

I think this is the crux of it right here. Your boss is insufferable, and unfortunately there's nothing you can really do to change him or his behavior. As I see it, you have two options:

A) Transfer to another ""section"" or whatever if possible so that you have a different boss.

or 

B) Meet with your boss at the next available opportunity or send a very professional email. Show him the number of hours you are working/have recently worked. Show him the contract/agreement/acceptance letter for this position where it states you are expected to work 20 hours per week. Tell him ""BossesName, I really enjoy this job, but I can no longer work unpaid overtime. I signed up for 20 hours per week of work, and that is what I budgeted my time for. Working an extra 10+ hours each week is cutting into my studying time for my classes and for the GRE, and I can no longer do this as it is affecting my academic performance, and sleep schedule. Moving forward, I will not be able to work past my 20 scheduled hours. I will let you know when I have hit my 20 hours for the week each week. Thank you for your understanding.""

Really though, I don't know what you're doing here. It seems like you're pretty much in love with him and want to date him, but for some reason you're settling for whatever bullshit this is. Why?

"At some point you will have to make that distinction. That you don't believe your wife is right about your sister. Maybe you should talk to your sister about these issues, or suggest going to therapy together with your wife. I really think your wife probably views your sister as someone who has succeeded in a lot of the ways she wanted to but hasn't. So your sister just reminds your wife of her own failures. She then assigns those negative feelings to your sisters actions to have someone else to blame for those feelings. 

I think to get your wife help, real help you will have to stop enabling her to carry on this silent war against your sister. That means picking a side, getting help, or getting your sister involved. "

"So let me recap this on my own words: 

You used to be borderline alcoholic but stopped drinking altogether. Before you stopped drinking you were with your outright alcoholic friend and didn't respond for at least 12 hours. She was worried and angry that you didn't answer your phone, a couple of states away, while you were drunk with your alcoholic friend. She confronted you over text. Your friend, under the influence of alcohol, called her whatever it was admittedly childish, over social media that she didn't like. Afterwards he apologized like ""lol sorry I interrupted your nagging.""

And you wonder why she doesn't like your friend?

You were on the edge of being alcoholic and she put up with it all. I bet she was worried sick. And you here nothing better to say than ""he apologized (to me). She should forgive him"" He shouldn't have meddled with your relationship. 

Has she ever met him at this point? You never said anything about their relationship before this incident. I bet she didn't like him that much before it all happened and she only stayed quiet for your sake. Ask her about this point.

And by the way 

&gt;He doesn't drink as much anymore, though. Last year he drank until he threw up blood and doesn't do it as much anymore.

So he drank till he vomited blood regularly but doesn't do it much? What does this mean? He used to do this every other week but does only do it once a month now? IF a healthy person drank as much even one time they would stop drinking for a while altogether. There is no such thing as ""drinking culture"" only alcoholic drinking buddies! This is in no way, shape or form healthy or sane behavior. He really needs help. 



&gt;And I wanted him to be my best man, but she said she wouldn't have him up there standing behind us.

No shit Sherlock. She doesn't want the guy who disrespected her and your relationship at the celebration of this relationship? Gee, you think? 
 
&gt;So we're not even having a wedding party because he's the main person I would want up there.


Uhmmm ... Who are you marrying again? I thought she was the main person up there to you. That's really shitty of you to punish her because you have a shit family and shit friends. 


If you want to mend this all and not loose her you have to get them to speak with one another and make at least truce. And you need your friend realize he has serious problem with alcohol.

"I loved reading this thank you. It reminded me of my relationship with my girlfriend. We were 15 in high school hanging out all summer. We were so close we saw each other everyday.  I was confused for that whole summer not understanding why this felt different from any other friendship. I kept convincing my self I was seeing something that wasn't there. Ohh and ""I can't be gay this isn't me."" Her dad was a night time stocker so he was never home at night. Summer was coming close to a end and spending the night over there was going to stop because of school. We were on the couch and we feel asleep on each other. I woke up to use holding one another and we just did that tell school started back up we never talked about it. Just did it so casually and I still thought I was putting to much thought in to it. School started up and the next weekend I spent the night laying in bed I just went for the kiss. It was the best feeling in the world we kissed for 2 hours straight fell asleep and would start back up again tell it was morning. This story sounded a little like ours. We have now been together for 9 years on August 20th. I couldn't be more happier. This story made me grab her and kiss her. I am so luck. Y'all will be great together. It is something so different to be in Love with your best fried. I am so happy for you. "
"No, you're not a bitch for ending something with someone you don't want to be with. You're making the good decision for both of you. I don't think it's worth engaging with him in the future, after this; I'd go no contact and block him after you end things. He'll get over it. "
"If you are in the US your brother can potentially get emancipated from your mother right now, and your stepfather has no legal rights to him. I am not a lawyer, but I had friends that emancipated themselves and moved in with another family member."
"Thanks. It wasn't easy, I must admit. I was shopping for some groceries and found myself in the aisle adorned with liquor and it was not easy. My taste buds wanted to absorb the sensation of whisky again. But I can't regress to my 20 year old self. Back then, my responsibilities weren't so great. I could go on a two-week, non stop binge and the only one who would suffer would be me. That's not the case anymore."
"Lord. What is wrong with that woman?! 

But more importantly, what is wrong with your ex?!?! 

How can he accept this behavior?!? "
"&gt;Ex's new GF of 4 months cannont understand that we do Not want any pics of our daughter online, b

She understands perfectly. She just wants photos of your kid as part of her brand. "
OP listen to his entitlement here. Computer breaks on his watch and it's your job to fix it? You owe him and his bro a cheap laptop? He is entitled and thoughtless. 
"I agree with all of this.  To me, a ""little crush"" doesn't need to be mentioned at all.  The fact that she brought it up would weird me out, especially since she said she ""can't compete"" with you - there is no competition!  You're married to your husband!"
"I work for an IT consulting firm. Our recruiters are more likely to question a blank in a resume than if they took a ""lesser"" job. A lot of clients would pass if there's a big gap too. "

"I'm gonna go against the group on this one: I wouldn't meet up with her. After reading your subthread comment about her destined-to-fail list of ""dealbreakers,"" I wouldn't want to be in that situation of having to explain to her that her ""standards"" are ridiculous. 

The reason I think this: as a woman, I have had a few women friends much like the girl you dated. Trying to explain to an adult that their perfect man doesn't exist will just embolden them: ""You're asking ME to lower MY standards? Why should I have to compromise?"" In my experience, they fail to understand the difference between compromising critical dating standards (e.g, kind, interested, not violent) with optional preferences (e.g., apparently 6-foot-tall Jewish German photographers with smooth backs, expertise in Hegel, and an exclusive diet of what I can only imagine are chicken fingers).  

It's also far too easy to want to appear moderate and reasonable by admitting there were ""faults on both sides."" For example, you say ""it sounds like this guy doesn't exist. You're holding yourself back"" and she goes, ""yeah, well you did wrong things too."" Before you know it, the conversation is now all about the wrong things you did instead of discussing her ridiculous standards, a false equivalency in this case.

In these conversations, I feel like i ended up looking like the bad guy for suggesting they loosened up their standards. "
"Yeah it borders on 'selfish dude wants to make his girlfriend feel wonderful by ripping apart a ring that belonged to his deceased mother.'.

I get his dad is remarried but still a jewelry is jewelry.  I always imagined you only reset it if it's damaged."

"It sounds to me like you are the only person trying to make this a thing.

I'm not trying to be harsh but he's shown you repeatedly that he wants sex and a hang out session. If he wanted more he'd make it more, just like when he calls you to hang out for sex.

You're deluding yourself or he's taking you for granted. Doesn't really matter at this point because the result is the same. If you want to try and change it, I guess you could talk to him, but it looks to me like you are ignoring what he is telling you and will be upset when he says hes not interested in more."

"&gt;  she told my 9 year old ""salads are for skinny girls with eating disorders.""

Grandma needs a time-out. No more visits until she apologizes for being so rude and destructive and agrees to feed your kids real food. What a horrible (and wrong) thing to say. 

I can see why your husband had issues surrounding food. Don't let her inflict more on your children. "
"Being polite is one thing but you should be honest about how you feel. There's no need to tell her how ""dumb it sounds"" because that's kinda rude but maybe search your feelings and try to just express them honestly. Why do each of those things bother you? What specifically about her not shaving her legs bothers you? What specifically about her practicing wicca bothers you? Is it the lighting candles? The blessing stones?

That being said, the alcoholism that you brushed over seems to be the more important issue here. Why is she drinking so much? Perhaps she's not happy and needs a change but doesn't know what that change is."
"First off you are not an idiot. In no way are you an idiot because you went back. Many abuse victims do and you're only human. You can recognize now that it was the wrong choice for you but it doesn't make you an idiot.

You can just leave him again and you don't owe him anything to stay. Your own self protection is more important than anything else.

"You'll have a blast. Go. 

Otherwise, PM me, and I'll go in your place."
"If you've communicated and she's unwilling to make an effort, then yeah that's totally fair."
"I can see both sides to this coin.
 
I'm sure your father misses your mom but it has been three years.  Cut him a break.  It's not unreasonable for him to date.  And as for him encouraging you and Mary to get together.... that could be his way of trying to help you get some of that motherly experience that you won't be getting since your mom is not here.  He's not trying to replace your mom or forget her.  Sounds like he's just doing what he can with what he's got.  

As a mom with 3 kids and a mom far away, I assure you having this woman on your side for help and advice when you want will be welcome at times.  She's never going to be your mom but it's always nice for women to take care of each other.  She likely feels just as awkward about it as you do.  

I'm sorry you lost your mom but remember she is still with you and always will be.  Best of luck with your baby."
"But she did make a decision, which you vetoed and then refused to name a Japanese restaurant and instead snidely told her to look it up herself, despite being new to the area and not knowing where you like to eat (since when you said ""any restaurant"" you clearly didn't mean it). That's on you.

From this and the rest of your history, you sound like you're using this woman. Break up with her and let her find someone who cares. "
"Either he is worried about getting on her bad side (which us exactly why dating your boss is a terrible idea), or he has no desire to stand up for you or make uncomfortable things easier for you.

Im surprised at the comments blaming you for showing up at his office.  Unless you are actually making people uncomfortable... do you know in what way,  or what you're doing? Either way, that's clearly not the problem.  I think everyone else stopped reading before your mentioned the part about her showing up outside of work."

"If she's not telling you that she did in fact see a friend there etc. she's obviously cheating on you. Terrible situation, but the ""gym"" cover is surprisingly common. Although she actually goes to the gym, which is strange."
"&gt;slept with much more than 4 men in one year (it was a bad year) 

 Gah - can we please stop judging sexual partners?! I've had WEEKENDS where I've slept with more than 4 men, and it was amazing and fun and satisfying. 

Ps well on ya. Sex is great."
"Dude, boundaries. 

No woman is going to want to date a guy with a friend like this, because it's obvious that he already had a girlfriend in everything but name. There's so many bad boundaries here that it'd be hard to trust her to respect the relationships you have, sure, but it would also be hard to trust you. Randomly making out? ""We shouldn't have done that""? It's a built-in cheating guarantee. 

Until you build more distance with her, you're not going to be successful in the dating world because you already have a number-one."
I think most people will suggest therapy. I just want to say that you are extremely courageous and I respect you a lot.
"Tell her how you feel in a tactful manner. Also, sit down and budget. Decide how much each of you pays for rent, however you want. You could do it proportionate to salaries if you like. Give yourself allotted money to spend on entertainment and fun things, and you both can put money in the pot and take it from there. "
"If you're not ready, you're not ready. Forcing yourself to act as if your Dad's girlfriend is your mom isn't going to work and it's not a very reasonable request. All that should be required of you at this point is for you to show a willingness to be open to Mary being a part of the family eventually.   If all you can manage right now is tolerating her name when your Dad talks about her, then so be it. It may mean your family does something else for the holidays, but that's fine too. It doesn't have to be a big family fued. Perhaps see a therapist or grief counsellor, acknowledge the pain you are still in, try to work through some of these feelings you have about your Dad moving on and let them and the rest of your family get on with it. You will come around when it's right for you. 
There is no one I enjoyed talking to and spending time with during my pregnancy and after the birth of my kids than my mom. She is the one person who was as excited for my births as myself and my partner. She adores her grandkids and the many hours we spent and still spend together talking about them and gushing over them are so comforting and special. I think this is an experience many women have with their mothers and it's a right of passage you are unfairly being cheated out of. Your brother and your Dad absolutely do not have the same experience you do at this point in time with regards to the loss of your mother.  It must be difficult and I'm really sorry you have had to experience such a loss.  
Take your time, be kind but firm to your family and be open to Mary in whatever way works for you. Good luck!

"Look.  your dog destroyed her dress.  the one on ebay could have plenty of issues and may even be a knock off.  You have to get the original one. It sucks but this is what happens.  You are responsible for your dog's actions.  If it takes awhile to pay her back then so be it.  Also tell her she should keep her door closed from now on.  

Getting her the cheaper dress would be an insult. I don't know much about dresses but i know a thing or two about knockoffs when it comes to collectible items.  If someone's dog destroyed an expensive item of mine and tried to buy a knockoff one on ebay I would be really upset at the thoughtlessness.  It's easy to tell what's real and what's not if you know your stuff and I'm guessing she can tell what's quality designer and what's not."
"&gt;We did go to couple's counseling before getting married, but he got upset because he thought the therapist was taking my side too often and not pointing out my flaws enough. 

And you still married him?"
I really don't know why you're dating her. Is there a single thing about this woman that you like? Cos it sure as hell doesn't sound like it
"OP, you're 30. You didn't want to be exclusive. You say you also had a similar 1-2 night stand. 

Why are you allowing this to bother you? Why the double standard? 

Stop letting yourself obsess. Move on -- with her or without her."
"Maybe consummating your engagement with an act of public sex was how she always imagined the moment - that doesn't mean it was any less special to her. It sounds like you have different visions of how the engagement would go. Lots of women go through this too. They have a script in their head of how the proposal should go and usually the reality doesn't match up but they say yes anyway. If you're good with everything else in the relationship, I would let this one go. 

Source: my SO proposed by email after a near miss car accident, not at the top of the Eiffel Tower or by a romantic pond in Hyde Park, like I had hoped. But he proposed - been married 17 years."
"""I got the results of the test  back. I am definitely tired of not being able to have a conversation without you quoting 'The Room.'"""
"Same scenario, but 5 years, during/ after college having started dating when we were 17. From the beginning my bf would get upset and frustrated if he couldn't get a certain reaction from me within a certain timeframe that wasn't tiring for him. With that amount of pressure to orgasm, I never even came close to achieving anything, so I kept having to lie about it so I wouldn't have to put up with him pouting for a day or two... eventually I realized that my role was really just to make him feel good (mentally or sexually or whatever) and it wasn't really about me/ my body/ my feelings. The first time I worked up the nerve to let him know that wasn't happy and that I needed a change from him, he dumped me, it was really eye-opening. I'm now with a guy who I actually feel comfortable communicating with and I've never felt pressured to perform for him in that way or to lie about my actual reaction, I can just tell him that my body just can't do certain things in certain ways and we're both cool with that. It's possible that one day you'll notice this is part of a larger pattern of your relationship... personally I would be inclined to have a big talk about it just to see what his reaction is, if he can be trusted to actually communicate, and if not then maybe reconsider how good a match you are. I know you're relatively young, and don't yet have a perspective on this sort of thing, but I can't stress enough how relaxing and comforting it is to be with someone you have never felt the need to lie to."
"You need to distance yourself from ex in every way immediately. You need to learn how to financially support your daughter and yourself on your own. I know that your daughter will be hurt by not being able to spend time with the other girl, but she will be even more hurt if and when this woman decides to follow up on her threats. "
"Yeah, and at least with the soldiers I've known with PTSD it's an easier sell than traditional talk therapy.Because it's effective for many people very quickly, and I guess because it seems more practical and less ""touchy-feely"" to a certain type of man than talking things out? OP, could you or your daughter do a little research into EMDR and find a non-confrontational, gentle way to explain it and how it might help him? If he won't talk, maybe an email with links?"
"I would be very concerned with his education, especially since the Muslim school itself feels it's wrong for him.   Is there any kind of education authority you can contact?     I don't know how far you're prepared to take it, but could you legally force your mother to see that he's properly educated to an acceptable standard?    It seems clear he's not going to get it at this school and hard work DOESN'T always overcome  everything."
"How would he feel if she was making jokes about how small his dick is or how short he lasted in bed? 

It's totally reasonable and normal to not be okay with your partner making jokes at your expense."

"I don't want to come off judgy or anything but... this is so strange. I grew up in a family that saved water by only flushing solids. So there was often pee in the toilet, but I've never encountered shit. How do you not mind people peeking your shit that's been steeping in a toilet cold brew for hours? Not ashamed of the smell either? 

Strange. Keep us updated because I'm thoroughly fascinated."
Right? Like I may be a six but my best friend makes me feel like a 10 with how much she pumps me up about myself. Friends make you feel good about yourself!
"My thoughts exactly. Something about this trip just smells off, but you don't want to hear that. You want us to tell you that your husband is being unreasonable, but I don't think he is. Your boss's request, especially since he has asked it of two different people, is really sketchy. Why doesn't he hire a nanny or something?"
[removed]
Shouldn't he be bending over backwards to do those things because it's his home and children??  Not to get laid?  This all sounds super manipulative.
That is just wrong and weird. 
"About Christmas and other such ""family holiday"" how about you alternate : one year at your parents, one years at his parents ? Or Christmas at his, Easter at yours and New Year just the two of you by yourselves ? Explain to your MIL, nicely that you love your parents and they are as important to you as she is to your fiance, and set up some ground rules that are objectively even and fair. 

As for the wedding... Depending on who's organising maybe consider inviting less of his family and more of yours ? My brother had that problem for his wedding, our family is huuuge, but his wife's tiny. So while she invited all of her extended family and family friends, my brother only invited his immediate family and uncles and aunts, but no cousins and only his very very best friend. He still had 3 times the amount of guests she did, but at least it wasn't too bad."
"So, I wasn't going to comment but I decided I should. I have a feeling your cousin may be BPD. 

Full disclosure: so do I. 

I am definitely not trying to armchair dx, especially because that's better left to a professional but her behaviours are very concerning. With BPD, you often lack a sense of self and its so very easy for us to pick up behaviours or traits of people around us. I have a feeling this is what's happening to you, esp when you commented about the celebrity she copied. I think it's possible if she's bpd, that you are an FP - ""favourite person"" and it's so much more likely that this is why she is copying you to this degree.

BPD does cause issues when it comes to gender and sexuality identity but with everything going on, it's just really...strange. Her rage over everything just sets off alarm bells for me, with the copying and the lack of self awareness and the ""me me me"" attitude. BPD people can be really self reflective, like I'm the self destructive subtype, but I feel she is more the petulant type. She may never want to get better or seek help, or even want to be called out on her toxic behaviour. 

But this is something important regardless, no matter how much you or your family tries to ""help"" or ""support"" her, it's not going to matter unless she *wants* it. She is toxic and it's having an impact on you and your family and this is not something that any of you should put up with. The number one rule of supporting and helping someone is that they need to want to help themselves first, and I truly don't believe she wants it. She wants to be coddled and her behaviour and actions excused. Never sacrifice your own mental health to coddle someone else's. Your parents need to grow a spine and kick her out. She's an adult now. She needs to get her shit together, get psychological help or she is honestly doomed to condemning all her relationships to disaster. But you are under no obligation to help her, nor are your parents. 
"
"""freedom to find out who I am"" sounds more cliche and silly to me now than when I wrote this. What I meant is that I want to travel alone, take time away from other people, try new things by myself. The typical things I think you should do before you're in a serious relationship. Maybe I can do it now. I feel like a different person than who I was when we fell in love.

I know she doesn't feel the same way as I do about the marriage. It's also not like we never have deep conversations, it's just after 10 years, we don't talk much. She's a quiet person."
"She was doing drugs at 12 years old? I mean even if she started at 13, I can't imagine the damage she did to her growing brain. How would she have gotten ahold of drugs at that age and why? You don't ever have to forgive her, hang out with her, or call her family but if she started drugs at 12 years old there had to have been some sort of peer pressure or coercion. The severity of the damage depending on the kind of drugs at an early stage in her development might explain her poor rationale, not that is excuses it."
Your mum is protecting a groomer and potential rapist of her child. Ask her how she feels about that? 
"She broke up with him because he doesn't make a lot of money. Her sister fed her that bullshit and she gobbled it up and agreed. In the end OP broke up with her bf because she believed he was not good enough for her, and his pay was a huge factor in that. "
Kick him out. That's unacceptable behaviour. 
"this! If you're in a one-party state, you could even record him saying that."
"If you have to justify your relationship with ""well, he can't be prosecuted for it"", that should tell you a lot. 

He was 28(?) years old ""dating"" a 16 year old. I don't care where you're from, that's just dead wrong. He's a pig. "
"This was bad advise. See the above comment about not putting the emotional labor on her. Don't make her think of what you can do-- YOU think of, and do, something. You've known her a long time, and you're a big boy. Plan something really nice and give her a real-life apology. "
"And this is EXACTLY what you come back with if he tries to divert or shut down the conversation with ""how dare you eavesdrop me!"""
"Okay some of the comments in here are quite scary, and reek of paternalism. I started out working in EMI units and I'm now a hospital RN and whilst sometimes we may feel we need to take control over an elderly persons life because it's 'what's best for them', unless they're lacking capacity it's not okay. OP is VERY right to be concerned but saying things about forcing them apart and moving the grandfather to a new home... pretty damaging and aren't considering the grandfather's rights to autonomy and to MAKE HIS OWN MISTAKES. This man does not lack capacity and therefore does not need to be treated like a child who's dating someone the family disapproves of. 


OP needs to treat them both like the adults they are and have separate discussions with them. I would also give the home a heads up so they can keep a look out for any declines in mental condition that this woman could potentially take advantage of, because that's the point in which a more paternalistic approach would be needed. Also document everything, from comments made to observed changes in mood. Ask the home to do this as well. If there's a social worker who OPs grandfather is known to speaking to them too so they can preempt any safeguarding concerns. This is what's important here, safe guarding but without removing the man's autonomy."
"Could be that the house, and his bedroom, reminds him of the situation. My ex husband and I bought the house I grew up in (My parents had sold it and the new owner happened to put it up for sale as we were looking). After a couple of years living there it stopped being the house I grew up in, and became my married house, the house I was building a life in with my husband.


When we started the divorce process, he offered to let me keep it. I talked about selling it so we could both get some cash and a fresh start. He was very insistent I keep it because of the sentimental value, but that sentiment was gone for me and replaced with a different one. I told him finally that I was just going to move out either way, and he could keep the house or we could sell it. He decided to keep it, didn't want to move and he likes the house.

When people hear the TLDR that he got the house, they think it's weird given it's history. But, I didn't want it either way. We didn't have a messy split, we're still really good friends in fact. I just didn't want to live in a house that carried so many memories with him.

I'm assuming it's similar for this guy. Especially if the other roommates are/were his good friends and didn't take his side on this. Cheating is bad enough as it is, but she did it in the home she shared with him, in his bed, while he was home, with one of his friends, while a ton of others were present. The amount of sorrow, embarrassment, and disgust he must have felt all in that moment would be something I'd want to disassociate from too."
"Unfortunately, it's not. He has admitted to intentionally telling me I was misremembering events or conversations so that I would get confused and drop whatever I was arguing for. I almost went to the doctor cause I couldnt figure out why I couldn't remember things accurately.

I just really thought we were past it. "
"Please leave him before he kills you.

Go to the doctor, or a hospital, and have your injuries documented.  While he's at work, move everything you can't live without out of your house.  Change the passwords on all your accounts.  If you share banking, take your share out of there, and open a new account elsewhere.

I ignored this kind of behavior, OP, and my ex almost succeeded in killing me."

"I think you have a valid point about him removing things from your desk without informing you. Would he go take the lamp from your manager's desk without informing your boss? Probably not. Maybe you should have filed a report that your lamp was taken without proper notification. If anything, it sounds like this guy is trying to mess with you.

Also, have you told your boss that things at your desk keep being damaged, shifted or removed from your desk since you've started? I think that will go a long way to explaining why you were fed up when you found the light, that you had just setup, was missing with no explanation as to why.

I would just try to calm your nerves before the meeting, explain yourself and what's been happening with your desk, and apologize if you were a bit agitated after seeing that your lamp was missing."
"I really don't think that her period has anything to do with it. I think the reality of being in a relationship with a guy half her age sets in from time to time. 

Age gaps that large are fine in the short term, but long term they rarely last. Have you met her family, friends? Have you considered your future with her and how that will go? "
"Oh lord another grown adult who blames their flaws on being ""introverted.""

You know who can spend a couple dinners with your ex? A mature adult that realizes you had a child and needed to be there for her. Anyone that married someone with a child should be able to support that relationship. And at the very least you could have gone alone to support your own daughter. You're both to blame and there's no excuse for the decisions you've made. It probably cost you any chance of a close relationship with your own daughter.  "
"&gt; My fiAnce says it's my ex manipulating me and my son needs to get it together and take responsibility.

Whoa, what? I don't need to read anymore. Your son is 11. Just how much responsibility does she think he is capable of taking?

DTMFA. This woman is unreasonable."
"You sit down with her and apologize, from the heart and mean it. Promise to do better, explain that you didn't realize but now that she's told you it's obvious. Then you start making an effort to see her more, you start calling to check on her, invite her to dinner. 

You should probably share this with your wife, who at best is a shit stepmom.  She needs to make amends too. 

For goodness sake, a family photo of you, your wife and your other two kids? Come on, how do you not notice you're leaving her out?!?"
"The only real assholes in that list are the ones in the sporting competition, and yes people can be real assholes in dumb competitions with nothing on the line so I really don't think you have yourself to blame (unless you tolerated instead of telling them to be polite or leave).

All the others are probably just examples of you reading way too much into people being indifferent, uncommunicative, or possibly issuing you unintentional slights.

Have you talked to your boss about your observations, and how you would appreciate corrective feedback in private?"
"It honestly annoys me when people do this. I had a friend that did it and it would be weird to hear stories retold where I was there and things happened to us that did not. 
 
You're trying to make lying outright seem like a cute quirk. But it's just lying."
"Let's recap.  He loves her.  He doesn't respect your feelings.  He STILL has her as a friend. 

You need to urgently develop a strong sense of worth and realize you deserve better than a guy who's only marginally devoted to you.  Break up with him and go find someone that wants to be with you."
"I do say no. It generally proceeds to some pleading and coaxing, he'll give me a back massage or rub my feet. Offer to do anything that I want him to do. Sometimes he does take no for an answer, often admitting that we do have a *lot* of sex, other times he gets angry, it depends on what else has been going on.

Mostly he wants a very intimate relationship. Love notes, flirting, candles, and lots and lots of physical intimacy. He puts in a lot of effort on this front and gets resentful that I don't do as much. "
"I agree with the other commenters who say you should trust your instincts about what is happening here. Also, ask yourself if you are really happy with this ""lackluster"" sex life. Would you want to marry him if you felt sure he was attracted to you, if the sex was still this infrequent? "
"I'm 29F, my mom passed away almost 6 years ago due to cancer as well (I'm very sorry for your loss). It was just me and my dad living at home afterward, and it was incredibly difficult for me emotionally when about a year later I realized he was out dating fairly often. I can't imagine what you must be going through with you being pregnant as well, I remember I was at a point in my life maybe five years ago when I thought I would never even want to have a baby if my mom wouldn't be there to support me through it all. 

Honestly, I feel like this could have been handled better from both sides. When my dad wanted me to meet the woman he was seeing, it wasn't because of any big events that were going on in MY life. He also didn't put pressure on me to have a relationship with her. It also seems like it's more for your dad than for you that you don't ""miss out"" on having her there with you for the shower and other baby related things? 

In the end, your family is different from mine. When my mom was sick, she told me she did give permission for my dad to meet and be with someone new after she passed, so that gave me some feeling of peace. My dad's mom also passed away (a few years before mine did) and he's had to see his father be with someone new, someone who was a family friend of theirs as well, and that lady comes to our family events too. So he handled it with grace, I'm trying to follow his example and wish him well. I've come to feel that having a companion is good for him - he's kind of a workaholic and doesn't really have any hobbies, so if he's going out and having a nice time with someone nice then I'm happy for him. He knows, and I know as well, he's not out there trying to replace my mom. She was a one in a billion lady.

I don't think your dad or your brother can truly understand what you're going through, as a motherless daughter about to become a mother herself. It is a LOT to handle. Having this on top of it is certainly no picnic. But, we still can resolve to handle ourselves with grace. Is there some family of your mother's that you can talk to, perhaps to reassure you that you can muster up the courage to face this new challenge? It will be difficult and awkward, 1000 percent, but it does unfortunately get easier. Grief, as I'm sure you know, is a rollercoaster. We have our good days and we have our really really shitty days. I'm sure you and your dad can reach some sort of compromise if you show that you're willing to allow yourself some vulnerability in an admittedly already emotionally vulnerable time - you may not have to include this woman in all that he's asking, but you can smile and make nice for some things.

Lastly, I wish you well for the remainder of your pregnancy and so much happiness with your baby. Always reach out for your supports, the ones you can trust and count on!"
"It's a terrible idea to stay in a relationship because of length or trying to not hurt the other person/their family. I was on the other side of a relationship like this. Dragging it out is hurting you both more in the long run, you're just avoiding the acute pain of the breakup. He wasted a year of both of our lives by not being honest with me. Breakups suck but she will be fine without you, I promise. I'm way better off now over a year later, and I have a new boyfriend who adores me.

 You guys have grown apart, it happens to many people in their twenties. End it completely, you can both find partners that are more compatible.   "
"It may be a low-key fetish thing.  It's not an uncommon one.

It's definitely a creepy one though.  He likes you as a genetic broodmare, but not as a legitimate person to date?  Yikes.  I'd be out of there, regardless of how charming or good-looking he is."

"This is a textbook case where I recommend reading *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin DeBecker. Basically, you have finely tuned instincts inherited from your ancestors concerning other people that might hurt you. Listen to them. You have literally said in your post that this guy might murder you. Ha ha, but that sounds like a joke with a ring of truth to it. I second the calls to have some kind of protection around, as allowed by your local laws, and to have a plan in case this guy enters your apartment.

I don't presume to know how to handle it, but just to say you are justified in treating this as a situation where the guy is stalking you. In other words, you do not have to be ""nice,"" or communicate at all, except what you believe will keep you safer.

I still have nightmares about my brother üò£ good luck. "
"If women had more access to sexy imagery of men, and were as encouraged to enjoy it, and if men had a bit less and were a bit less encouraged to consume it, we'd all be better off. Until then, context matters; you can't just tell her she has low self-esteem and wave away the bigger problem here."
"I'm not sure why your work is stalled- you should still be able to put together the family history even if he's not the bio Dad. The present is for him and you should be able to still capture his family tree.  How did you identify she wasn't his daughter through DNA?  How come she hasn't seen her own DNA results to come to the same conclusion?  If you are relying on just ethnicity results, that isn't a true indicator.  Did her parents both test as well?

"Sounds like he banged it out with the new roomie ASAP.

"Not addressing the wrongness in sulking because you don't want to have sex, because that's another reply which I'm sure someone will give you. But: If you never have experienced these fits of rage before putting it in, it may very well be due to your IUD. I have the same reaction when on gestagens or progesterons. I'll snap over nothing and go into Hulk rage mode while at the same time the sane part of my brain goes ""No, stop it! This is an unacceptable reaction for someone buying you chocolate!"". The only thing that has helped with these are simply quitting the BC and changing. I need combination pills or I seriously go insane."

"Do you always have sex on his terms? How often do you get the space to initiate? My husband has a ridiculous sex drive too and even though I do too, I can't stand constantly getting groped all day. When he does that it feels like I disappoint him over and over by saying later tonight (when I'm mentally in the mood) so when we do finally have sex it's not about bonding but meeting his needs. 

Most times I get to initiate the sex is better. I feel hotter. Sex should be about both of your needs. 

And I'm sorry but you need to put your foot down on the tantruming when you say no. That's really gross and manipulative. He is not entitled to sex. You guys should have equal free time. 

My husband and I had sex 2-3times a day over Christmas because we were so carefree. Now that we're working neither of us have the energy for more than once a day. I'd imagine he might have this higher drive because his life is less stressful. Equality is more about equal free time than equal split of responsibilities. 

Think about your time as a resource. If he has 8 hours of spare time a day and you have only 4 equality doesn't mean you both do equal amounts of household managing. You wouldn't split bills 50/50 is you had a big income disparity so why do you split household stuff 50/50 with a time disparity? 

How much self care time do you get a day? Is there an isssue with you not having enough time to yourself with all the time you have to spend having sex, working, and taking care of your house and family? "
"&gt; I'm not going to be the one to always initiate us hanging out.

That's good, but there's still no harm in inviting him on one actual date out of the house. If you sit around and wait for him to do it, you risk giving him the impression that this casual thing is what you really want."
"&gt; He talks about marriage to me.. but this small thing is ruining our relationship for me   

OP between the poor sex life and this, for heaves sake DO NOT GET MARRIED. Fix this and how he makes you feel before taking the next step.    

I know this is not what you asked - but are you OK to live with this sex life?"
"I agree that you should speak to the husband and have that conversation in the kitchen. At that moment, designate where your shelf and fridge space will be. Tell him that you need x number of cabinets for yourself and y area of shelf space in the fridge, and you would appreciate if your items were not moved around. (If they don't have space for their stuff, they don't get to encroach on your space.) If the wife touches your stuff, gently notify the husband and ask him to remind her that cabinet/shelf is yours only.

I would not bring up the rent percentage as justification for space, but simply the fact that you live there too and the kitchen is a shared area, so they need to be respectful of you using it too. (Why is the rent split unevenly? Do you have a larger bedroom or private bathroom or something?)

Just curious- had this couple already been living there, or did you all move in at the same time? I'm wondering if they have been used to living like this in the particular space."
"If you have reason to believe he is lying or being shady, you definitely need to have a conversation with him and tell him you know the dates those condoms are good for. Gauge his reaction. It might not tell you what you want to know, but it's worth trying. I would ask as many questions as possible to see if you get consistent answers or if he hesitates on anything. Definitely come to him with facts though. Like the ones you found on the net. 

Also, had the box been opened? Are there a lot left? "

"Wow. That's scary. Not sure I could handle that. I would ask grandma if I could stay with her while working on a divorce and getting a job...and also move very far away, because that guy sounds nuts, literally mental, which would scare me. I don't know if I'd be comfortable with someone like that raising my child. Perhaps talk to a lawyer. 
Edit: obviously talk more with him about why he sought you out. Maybe he'll admit his obsession. This could help legally. 
Edit 2: if you're going to stay, be very careful, make him talk with you about this, and always keep an eye on him to make sure he isn't dangerous. I'm sorry, it's just this guy sounds mental. "
Sounds like bullshit to me...but trying to get perspective 
"I'm just going to throw in these other possibilities: Could she have been sexually abused, at some point?  Or could she have used intravenous drugs?  Could she have gotten a tattoo or had some procedure with dirty needles?

Also, why did you get an STI test if you were both each other's firsts?  Did you suspect her of cheating?  I mean, you had to specifically request the HIV test.  They literally can't do that test without your explicit authorization.  "
"I'm glad to see a more understanding attitude in this sub.

"""No I'm not mad, just busy. Have a good weekend and I'll see you Monday! ""

Hold your ground and insist you are not mad, you just don't have time or availability to socialize. It might feel like a huge nuisance to continue having the conversation but eventually I do think she'll give up if you don't give her any trickle of additional information or ammo. When you are with her for work, be pleasant and jovial. If she makes things difficult for you or is unprofessional, be prepared to bring the issue to your manager or HR, explaining she has been hounding you to socialize outside work, you've declined, and now she's being unpleasant and unprofessional.

"Wait and see whether he reschedules next week as planned. 

I'm also an introvert, and dates twice a week with constant contact in between when it's known that I don't enjoy texting would exhaust me.

Cut him some slack. He sounds pretty attentive otherwise and like he just needs to recharge. "

"Well, after these types of situations, we usually argue for a few days and then eventually he apologizes and says that he understands that he was wrong, things will be different next time, etc. Except it never does end up changing, he still ends up falling into the same pattern or behavior and has never chosen to make me happy over his mom. 

He tells me that she's been through a lot in her life; he owes it to her to take care of her. She, on her part, does not take criticism well and will even self-abuse if anyone disagrees with her. He says he gets scared of what she may do if he were to say/do something against her. "
"You SIL is at fault here. There is no way she should be this upset over not getting the  ""good"" room. If she is truly this upset over it she is acting like a spoiled child. I'd probably just ignore her. It's tough to lose a friend, but you can't give in to these childish games. Maybe talk to your brother and see what he says about this?

Out of curiosity why did they always get the ""good"" room before? Did they pay more or something? "
"He will do this again. He will. The fact that he is not remorseful tells you that he doesn't really see hitting you to be a problem. Please, for your own safety, leave. 

And then don't go back. When he realizes he's losing you, he will cry, beg, plead, and promise ANYTHING. It is all a tool to manipulate you. Don't believe it. If you stay he will eventually convince you that you deserve it too."

"&gt; It makes my family think we're having sex, and I'd really like to avoid that.

I think this is a great way to frame it. Don't argue the semantics of whether or not ""making love"" and ""lovers"" are always in reference to sex. The reality is that context is key, and in this context (modern English, that is...), it's going to be understood as sexual. 

&gt; She reads lots of old books and she thinks the words ""lover"" or ""making love"" mean something non-sexual. 

I repeat, context is key. In her old books, sure. But in the context of a conversation with your family, that is not the case. She doesn't get to arbitrarily decide the meanings and connotations of words because of what she *wants* them to mean. "

"You guys are at that age when most people start emerging from their families, looking around, and saying ""oh,wow, that was NOT normal!"" Everyone else here seems to have covered that your GF needs to minimize contact, go to counselling etc... so I'll say one thing that should be said. Her brother is clearly the **Missing Stair**. She grew up in a house with an egregious safety hazard, a missing stair on an unlit staircase. Everyone in the family simply knows to walk around it, avoid it until it's second nature. So your GF constantly tripping over it is *her fault* in their eyes. But IT'S NOT. They have accepted a serious problem rather than bothering to address it and they blame everyone else for their injuries if they happen to fall victim to it. 

This is why therapy is important for her, because not only is her family not normal, they are abusive, both in action and by proxy. "

I don't know how self-aware she is about this stuff but again, it can't be your problem to solve (or to wait around for her to solve; definitely don't do that.)

"So this is actually advice Carolyn Hax often gives to people ho have been with their partners for whatever length of time, and are upset with the lack of proposal. Absolutely requisite is that you've talked, and made it clear that you're ready for marriage, which it sounds like your girlfriend has done. Then decide how long you're willing to stay un-engaged. It's an internal decision, and it doesn't and likely won't be so firm as ""by July 25th, we're engaged or I'm leaving"". Just a conversation with yourself. Can I be okay with the status quo for six months?  A year?  Two?  How long can I wait with no proposal and still be able to start again with someone else and still be young enough to have as many kids as I want?  Then, in six months, or a year, or two, you check in with yourself again. It's not a number you share, because that creates an ultimatum. No one wants to marry someone who didn't want to marry them. And it's a lot harder to find a new relationship after a divorce when you're potentially too old to have the kids you want then to start again unmarried and unbabied"
"&gt; I'm captain of my volleyball team, I'm on academic decathlon and I do lots of clubs.

I mean this in a good way, but you're a bit intimidating as well. I mean, athletic, academic and social status shouldn't get in the way of romance, but for many high schoolers ranking and being in/out of someones league is as important as romantic attraction. And on top of that, your dad is an elite soldier.

Now all of that said, I would just keep doing you. While it doesn't feel good that Ryan rejected you, you did the right thing by asking him directly.

"Why would you marry someone if such a little thing as ugly pajamas &amp; a haircut makes you uncomfortable? She's comfortable taking off her face &amp; being vulnerable around you. I don't think you're shallow but I think there's more going on than you're implying.  Im not saying she should dress like a homeless person but sometimes you wanna relax without worrying about your looks. 


If my SO told me I looked unattractive after a hard day &amp; after taking off my day clothes, it would hurt my confidence &amp; my view of them. Then there would be this weird pressure to 'dress up' 24/7, even behind closed doors &amp; trying to relax in my down time. 

So strange. I could be wearing an old shirt &amp; shorts and my partner would still initiate sex. Hell I've dyed my hair a million colors &amp; cut it many times and it still isn't a big deal And we've been at it for 8 years...he casually tells me what he likes but he still respects my choices. 

It also works the other way. He has these old work out clothes from high school that he still uses and I kinda find them ugly but it isn't a deal breaker. He's had bad haircuts &amp; sometimes wears ugly pants but even then, its just not a big deal. He could wear a burlap sack and I'd laugh and still kiss him. 

Our sex life is pretty good too (3x a week). I mean yeah people should definitely spruce themselves up &amp; look presentable but getting picky about their looks after a long, tiring day? That's too much. It just doesn't matter. If you love each other, certain things just aren't a big deal. You put up with minor annoyances &amp; little differences because they're worth it all. My partner snores &amp; chews loudly sometimes, he sweats excessively...but its not a huge deal. Those quirks are reminders of his goofiness &amp; how he makes me laugh. 


It doesn't seem like you feel that. There's more going on with you buddy, maybe you should get to the core of your marriage and find out why you're feeling this way. You should be crazy about this girl &amp; speak with affection, but you make it sound like this marriage was one of convenience and duty. Find some happiness dude"
"I hope your dad learns a lesson that it's ok to talk about menstruation (too much, too little, etc) because it's a medically-related issue that all women need to pay attention to, and not something to be swept under the rug.

"First off, hes not a feeder. A feeder is someone who gets off on feeding their partners, watching their partners eat, watching their partners gain weight, ect. Its sexual. Your husband is doing this for your health and your future baby's health, not for sexual pleasure.

&gt; He says if I throw up after eating (which happens often) I need to load up my plate and try again. The worst part is when we went to see that doctor again she agreed with him! 

Secondly, youve had atleast two doctors say that theyre worried about your weight and how little youre eating/keeping things down. Can you ask which medications are safe for you to take to help keep you from vomiting after eating? Its obvious you need to gain more, but that would be easier if you werent sick after every meal. If you dont vomit as much, youll likely have to eat less."
"Do you want to sacrifice your happiness to satisfy your parents outdated opinions? 

It's not nice to think about, but someday they'll be gone and it'll just be you. What do you want your life to look like at that point?"
You're 25 years old. Do whatever you want. You do not need to listen to the dated ideas of your aging father. End of story.
"It sounds like you're the subject of some sort of game or bet.

Document everything that happened and inform them via writing that if they don't knock it off and start treating you professionally that you'll be informing HR about their behavior."
"These guys really are a type.  It happened to me,  almost exactly like OP, only he had just told my father he was about to ask me to marry him.  A week later,  he was in LA trying to become a screen writer. He left while I was at work,  leaving a letter and some books behind.  Your comment is basically perfect and mirrors my thoughts on how he justified what he did. 

A year later he tried to contact me.  NOPE."
"Whatever you do, this will end your marriage. Period.

And he has every right to leave you in the dust after this. You two planned a baby together and now you're backing out on him and you've COMPLETELY wasted his time and the best parts of his life by leading him on about it.

This poor man needs a divorce and he needs to find someone who wants what he wants out of life. Which is not you."
"So my boyfriend is a Brewmaster and can put some beers away. He's also a very big man. 12 pints in three hours would make him radically ill. Your boyfriend is just pushing his alcohol tolerance, he could still die trying to do this.

Call your local alcohol board. Don't tell your boyfriend. This is over serving, it needs to be shut down."
"&gt;No, there is no other ""unknown method."" Talk to her and ask her if she's been tested.

Erm, yes there is. You don't only get it from sex. You can get it from drug use/sharing needles, unsanitary medical equipment or needle sticks, and blood transfusions."
"Seriously! Why ""consider"" it? From one female dev to another, PLEASE tell HR asap. Maybe this can help us change the culture!"
"I know I didn't paint a very pretty picture, but my wife is such a nice person to everyone but Cleo. I guess that's why it's so hard for me to wrap my head around this. "
"&gt;The only reason I'm skeptical of her is because she is a scorned ex

Spoiler alert, that's EXACTLY how he's going to describe you to his next wife, as well as describing you as abusive, psycho, jealous, trying to ruin their epic love, etc. "
"I wonder what happens if you enter and say to one of the officials ""Oh, by the way, my BF told me to run this in his name. I'm not a runner, so I don't know, but it sounds kinda weird for me to do this. Is that allowed?""

But that's some serious cruelty right there."
"


I think he should have been very happy for you and yet the first thing he is talking about is what he is doing with his half.. did he tell you should buy the ticket? Did you guys talk about what you would do with the ticket if you won or was this just a whim kind of buy. I  don't know about anyone else but they only thing I would  possibly expect/anticipate but not necessary force on you j was maybe a nice dinner to celebrate but even then If it didn't happen I wouldn't be upset or mad about it. Congratulations on the win! "
"man i'm not sure why but OP, her bf, and John all creep me out after this story"
"Listen to this OP!

The best your child's father could get is 50/50 custody, and *he* is the one who will have to pursue custody -- grandparents don't really have custodial rights. 

And you may think you're doing the ""noble"" thing by not pursuing child support, but that is money, opportunities and things you're depriving your child that s/he is legally entitled to. "
She would be deeply hurt since she has always been a daddy's girl and very close to her father. 
Upvote for getting a magic wand/BodyWand. Those things will change your life and replace your religion.
"&gt; My family except my sister is telling me I overreacted by breaking up. 

Your family are gross then. Your sister knows what's up. 

Is your sister filing charges?"
"&gt;But then I also feel like he needs to understand that there are consequences to refusing to communicate about the lack of sex or work on fixing our dead bedroom and just letting the resentments fester and build up.  

My honest thoughts are that, while I understand your frustrations and built up resentment, I don't think this is an appropriate arena for their expression. Punishing him for not doing something you want him to do by refusing to do something he wants you to do is unecessarily petty and not constructive in any way. You can't just latch on to anything that has to do with sex and act out against it. You need to separate and manage your feelings here.

It's not super weird to not want to go to an ex's wedding, anyway, so I don't think you have anything to feel guilty about.

If he's refusing to communicate or work on your DB it's time for you to make a decision lest this keep coming up in increasingly weird and unrelated ways."
"You did nothing wrong. In fact your flushing problem may have been related to the pipe problem. 

Your husband should be supporting you, not trying to make the situation worse.  It's more concerning that he worries about them, than you. 

Stop feeling guilty. You were right place at the wrong time. 

I know of a house that had flushing problems. A root had grown into the pipe. Older houses can be prone to problems.  

Normally, honestly is the best policy. But in this case. Just let them fix the problem.  Don't give them a fake focus for their annoyance. 

Reverse it. Imagine they took you to court and told a judge, ""They broke the pipe, by flushing a toilet? The defendant even had the nerve to try basic unclogging methods.""
They would be laughed out and told that it is a maintenance issue. "
"&gt; He's kind of a picky eater in the sense that he really hates any type of vegetable in his food 

He's 25 now, so he's still too young for this unhealthy lifestyle to kick him in the health department...but it will eventually. 

&gt; he complains and says that it's not fair because he works way more than I do and and makes more than me.

So, I believe that you two have a very fair agreement worked out so far. What's unfair is for him to lord it over your head. Unless I'm misunderstanding things, you don't ask him or demand that he works a stressful, long work week job. His saying this would almost imply that he either is 1) bitter against you for this or 2) looks down on you and basically thinks that you're riding on his hardworking coattails. 

It doesn't really matter if his point is valid or not (though his presentation of his point was horrible, there is some logic in him thinking that since he is the primary bread winner, you should help out in other ways). What matters is how he views you. I'm not sensing that he respects you based on what you've described.  

&gt; It's not like I make NONE of the old foods I make too but whenever I make him something with vegetables or that's ""healthy"" he complains. 

So wait, you're still making him the stuff he likes; it's just that you also make him some healthy stuff? Dude, you're doing him a favor. For his own health, he should be at least eating something healthy every once in a while! He sounds pretty immature...

In summary though, my main concern is that it sounds like he doesn't respect you. "
"Who the fuxk is chopping onions in here?!!

Congrats, darling. That's so nice to hear :)"
"If you feel like you're being ditched, it's because you got ditched.  "
He's a hot trash fire. No one who has half their act together is going to get anywhere near this guy.
"&gt; It's all just in OP's head at the moment.

Right.  Because he cares what they think.  Even if they aren't being assholes about it.

My mom is the nicest woman alive.  She'd never rag on me for anything.  If someone convinced her I was a juggalo, I'd correct that impression, even if she never brought it up to me, because it is important to me."
"Personally I'd approach it from a different angle. Treat it as a given that you're not going, apologise for this but try and derail the discussion towards what she can do in the city on her own.

Do some research, help her out, find out if anyone you know has travelled alone so they can give tips.

If she doesn't want to do it then it should be on her not on you. (I don't know if that sounds harsh, but it's just because I've done it myself and it was fine)."
I'll be honest - I haven't been to one in over 6 months. I felt like I had moved beyond it. But I have been thinking about going back.
It's nice that you had your dad to fall back on. I wish I had some sort of reason. She never believes me when I say I want to stay behind.
"Be warned, when you talk to him he's probably going to pout that he really was planning on proposing any minute but ""you knew"" wanted the proposal to be a romantic surprise event and now you ""ruined it"". I don't care if he literally has a ring in his pocket and a string quartet hiding in the shrubbery when you sit him down to have this conversation... if he pulls that pout, **please** be clear with him that if any surprise got ruined, **he** is the one that ruined it by farting around for over a year and a half while you patiently watch perfect moment after perfect moment go by. 

But honestly I don't think he's really got a proposal plan, though it's really likely say he totally did, to try and make your disappointment your fault not his.  

I tend to think like others he just doesn't feel like getting married ever and thinks you'll just be fine not rocking the boat. I would seriously consider whether I even want to be married to him at all. Is he going to drag his heels on every life event? If/when you want kids, is he going to keep putting you off until you are 45? If this relationship is going to go anywhere healthy, you two need to be able to talk, plan, set goals. 

"
"I don't get how this ""spoiled"" anything.  The proposal itself is still a mystery, and you already had discussed getting married with your SO anyway, so what exactly has changed?  "
"God, I would swear we are married to the same man. I have no advice,  but I feel your pain. If we don't do it one night, I can expect it the next morning. It is a 1-2 times daily thing. We are younger, slightly,  at 35 (me) and 32, but it's been this way for 9 years. We have 3 kids, and work full time. I have no advice, I am just glad to know I am not the only one feeling ""overworked""!"
"Next time you see him passed out in the yard, call the non-emergency number for the police and ask them to send someone to check on him. People die that way."
"""My house is burning down.  Literally everything is fire.  What should I do? 

P.s. please don't tell me to leave the house."""
