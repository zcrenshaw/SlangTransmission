You are way too young to be dealing with this and basically falling victim to sunk cost fallacy. Do you want to spend the next 60 years with this type of crap? And don‚Äôt mix finances unless you‚Äôre married.
I don't even get how it make sense lol
Wearing your wife down with verbal abuse should scare you more.

"If you stay with her, your lifestyle will change. If you don't want that, move on. "
"I‚Äôm a little confused here. What is the problem with percentage based? If you divided up expenses based on income, she *wouldn‚Äôt* be paying more per month, she‚Äôd be paying less. 


I think her financial habits are mostly irrelevant when it comes to splitting bills: the only thing you have to think about there is whether or not you‚Äôre going to be compatible with her long term if her financial habits don‚Äôt change. 


Anyway, you bring in $40k, she brings in ~$22k. So you make 65% of the combined income, and should therefore be responsible for 65% of the bills. That leaves her to pay around $370 in rent and only 35% of the utilities. I think that‚Äôs an incredibly reasonable request on her part considering she moved for your job and normally couples DO split expenses based on their income. 


I don‚Äôt think it was wise for her to not accept a free car, but there could have been a myriad of reasons why she may have wanted to pick her own car. Did you talk about it? Did you talk about career prospects for her? Surely she can‚Äôt be content working fast food for the rest of her life. Start there. "
"Honestly you need to go to therapy to figure out why you would go back to your abuser in the first place, despite his changes. Having a secret relationship and living a lie for 3 years is a strong indication that you are not in a very healthy place. 

You cannot tell them what you have done without ripping out their hearts. You will devastate your family with this. I feel so bad for them.  I really don't feel sorry for you. 

Why oh god why would you go back to this guy? And then reproduce with him? Seriously do you think so little of yourself? 

I need to take a break from Reddit. This post just about broke me. The amount of inconsideration for your family is just heartbreaking and infuriating."
"I have this. When my husband comes downstairs and eats cereal, I'll just go back upstairs til he's done. When we eat dinner together, we put the tv on kinda loud, so chewing noises fade into the background. 

It's not a ""pet peeve"" any more than any other sensory thing a person can't stand, like a horrible smell, or being tickled, or having the back of a chair kicked nonstop during an airplane ride. 

I would suggest trying some background noises (tv, stereo), and maybe eating outside when the weather's nice. Those help for me at least. If that works well for the two of you, you could try then hosting an outdoor bbq with friends, and see how she does with that - and if it bothers her, she can run inside to the kitchen and do ""hostess"" things instead of sitting with everyone. 

"
"This is how I feel about this situation too. It also helps that the sister doesn't seem to be trying to force it too much. She isn't calling her sister daily, harassing her, etc. She seems to want OP to do it on their terms, and is willing to work with him. I think he should go. "
He'll eventually get over it when the baby is old enough to be around unvaccinated people. They're just being drama llamas at the moment in the hopes you will feel guilty enough to cave in. 
"I know this is easy for others to say, but please - respect yourself and walk away from this bs. You are worth more than being someones toy. "
In my experience this is what usually happens when one person dumps the other because they're going to start college/go to grad school/etc soon. The assumption is they can upgrade partners and sometimes that isn't the case.
"Yeah, if anything, it'll probably just convince them that the problem with young Indian women is more widespread than they thought."
"&gt; and he'd be able to understand my side of the story

It doesn't sound like you've tried to understand his side of the story, what makes you think he'll magically understand yours?"
"Nothing, but he's not the one posting here for advice.  I'd give him the exact same advice if it was him posting here and not you.

&gt; It has to start somewhere.

Correct!  Now armed with this knowledge, imagine out of the 2 of you, you are the only one who realizes this.  What implications does this have for your behavior?
"
"Yeah no, 5 years is 4 years too many and beyond ridiculous, which you know, clearly. Good on you for pushing her for therapy. Hopefully she‚Äôll come to her senses sooner than later. "
"He needs to block this girl, and honestly all of you should lessen her contact with her, especially if she's ""done a lot of uniquely peculiar"" stuff. "
"I'm wondering if something happened and she thought it was you... were you guys sharing the house? Did you guys threw a party and she ended up w/someone thinking it was you? If you guys shared a room I can kinda see this happening.

Did she act kinda weird any day? I mean, if I had slept with a friend who has a girlfriend I would be at the very least acting a bit weird on the next day...

You could try talking to her friends(if you feel that they can be trusted), of course, chances are that they might lie for her but there's always a chance that one of them is a decent person and will tell you if she made up this story..."

"No. None of that affects this situation. It's excuses that harassers make.

There is no circumstance that makes sexual harassment okay."
"It's not though, and saying women don't understand it because they're women is just ridiculous and incorrect. "
"&gt;  She will never trust you. 

And when you dump her (you really need to dump her) make it abundantly clear that her paranoid behavior is the reason why."
"Well, if you're trying to sabotage someone's weight loss due to incompatibility, you're not *good*. "
"Oh. My. God. That was exhausting. First of all, stop treating your girlfriend like she‚Äôs an invalid or a child. Some big, bad man ‚Äútook advantage of her emotional weakness‚Äù?  No. She made the choice to do what she did because she wasn‚Äôt happy with the status quo in her life. It was **her** decision. Stop treating her like a baby who has no agency and is incapable of making choices. 

Second, he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake out with her‚Äù.  They made out with each other. You need to wrap your head around the fact that your girlfriend is a grown woman and made the choice to make out with this guy. She is not a victim; she was a willing participant. Lose the neck beard attitude that women are weak and m‚Äôlady can do no wrong. 

Finally, you both need to start behaving like fucking adults. Have a conversation with her about what you each want from the relationship, and then make a commitment to do it or else end it. You two are not star-crossed lovers, so stop with this ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù crap. It‚Äôs going to exhaust her and make her resent you if it hasn‚Äôt already. 

"
"Thanks. üòä It doesn't always come easily to him, but at least he's made it past the ""this person likes X team so I will get them X team stuff for every gift"" stage. Maybe he could tutor OP's husband! "
"He's not having sex with you because he can't perform without porn. Porn Induced ED is a very real thing. Like /u/airaqua said... he's an addict.

Their suggestion of therapy is a good thing, but your husband also needs to seek treatment from a group like Sexaholics Anonymous. With sex/porn addicts, what you see is always just the tip of the iceburg and there is a shitload more under the surface."
"I think he does know, *and* he cares, because if OP takes it, he can keep pushing and see exactly how much he can get away with in this relationship. "
Think of it this way: you would be hurting her by *not* going. Don't let your sense of pride hurt others. Gracefully accept the gift.

"&gt;This is ABA. Many autistic people say that ABA is abusive.

I am not any sort of export on the matter, but wouldn't many teenagers classify their parents as abusive for simple discipline?  Just because we don't enjoy being disciplined or modifying our own behavior doesn't mean we don't eventually have to so we can become well-adjusted adults.

What I'm getting at is that /u/BehaviorChanger's anecdotal evidence is that it worked, and the kid was likely *very* uncomfortable during the initial stressor, but is better off now for it.  If there is no better suggestion besides ABA (applied behavior analysis, I had to google it), then we're stuck with what we have.

I just don't really understand what else we can do. If you ask *anybody* if they like being disciplined the answer will always be no. But you can't raise a child without discipline."
"It sounds to me like she needed a lot of reassurance, because this was her first time messing around with someone, and she wanted to know that it was meaningful. And instead of hearing something meaningful and loving, you cracked a joke, and maybe implied that the fooling around wasn't interesting enough, and therefore you needed to bring Party Poppers to make it more interesting and fun. To her, when she was already feeling vulnerable, and trying to open up to you, she was absolutely not in the mood to hear a joke. She needed to hear nurturing, caring words.


Here's what I would do. First of all, in the future, Please understand that being intimate like that is extremely difficult for some people, especially someone who has never done anything like that before. She is placing a ton of trust in you. She needs to feel like that trust is not misplaced. She needs to feel that that intimacy is important to you. She needs to feel like you value it, and it's not just fun and games to you. If it's just silliness to you, then you should probably break up with her right now, and let her move on to someone who will cherish that intimate time with her as something meaningful, instead of just silly fun.

But if that intimacy is as meaningful to you as it is to her, then you need to talk to her about it, because she is feeling very raw and vulnerable, she tried to put herself out there and talk about it with you, and you made a silly joke about it, and now she feels like you used her. Reach out to her, Express things to her about how much you care about her, how much it meant to you that you were able to share that experience with her, and how sorry you are that you made a silly joke afterwards. Make sure she understands clearly that the experience was extremely meaningful and important and valuable to you.

I know a lot of times people use humor to try to diffuse awkward situations. I do it too. But that's because my husband and I have been together forever and we have that kind of dynamic. You and your girlfriend haven't been together that long, and right now, she's especially vulnerable and sensitive. She needs to hear caring, loving, nurturing words from you. There's a time for humor, but after intimacy is not the right time.

When in doubt, ask her. But in the meantime, I would go overboard showering her with kindness, loving words, and making sure she knows that her trust in you it has not been misplaced.

I'm sure that this will pass. And I'm sure that your girlfriend is not always going to be this sensitive. It's just that if this is her first time, and this relationship is so new, she is full of feelings, and she is desperate to know that you're in it to win it, and you're not just using her. She's really scared. She needs a lot of reassurance. So my advice is to hold back on the jokes for now, and go out of your way to reassure her, and once she feels more stable in the relationship, and knows that you're there for her, you can gently introduce some jokes and she'll find that she has more of a sense of humor about things, because she knows you're not going anywhere.

It is. Advancing a relationship too fast is characteristic of abusers."
"She's wearing work-appropriate attire. They're being misogynists. If she were wearing a potato sack they would find another way to be gross about it (e.g. by telling her to dress up). Their comments reflect on them, not her, and she can't change them as people by wearing dumpier clothes."
"Agree - the line drawn not at an autism diagnosis per se, but at disruption when paying out of pocket for something SO expensive.  Plenty of autistic people are able to cope without drawing attention to themselves during class, Noelle is clearly not going to be one of them at this stage."
"I think generational boundaries will always be a bit fuzzy, and OP is right on the boundary of what most people would consider a Millennial. He would be ""out"" according to the Pew boundary, but ""in"" under Howe/Strauss, which puts Millenials at birth years 1982-2004 and is pretty widely used (my intern gave a presentation last week in which he pointed out that, at 35, I am the ""oldest possible millenial"" - people gasped.) I always thought that was kind of ""the joke"" in that the pace of technological change during those years was so fast that it doesn't really make sense to lump them into a single generation, but when people point that out they're accused of being ""typical millenial snowflakes."" 

In any case - fair to debate the boundary lines, but my point about not assigning overwhelming importance to sexual identity vs. experience still stands. I love that ""kids these days"" (whatever you want to call them) don't get so tripped up by definitions."

Sure. Expect her to freak the fuck out and dramatically break up with you. Probably should just beat her to the punch and end it!
"I totally get what you're saying. But the way you're presenting it is ""he gets to watch hot girls, and that's hurtful to me, so I want to hurt him back by having male nudity in movies that I get to watch instead for a change, see how he feels about that"". What you don't realize is that this is a very damaging thought-process because to him it might not even be like that - I don't think he's lusting after these girls in movies at all, so to him male nudity is probably the same thing. If he's a movie guy he's probably just getting engrossed in the story. I have a hard time imagining him sitting there and drooling after an actress while his girlfriend is sitting next to him. Do you understand what I mean? 

I think you're giving your boyfriend way too little credit. I don't want you to ruin your relationship because you're seeing something that's NOT there. You mentioned you watch him during these scenes - how do you know he's lusting?"
"I will never forget when my intelligent ex threw a bunch of markers on the floor and as he picked up various colors said, ""See evolution is like this. If I pick up these random colors, it doesn't mean they make sense together. Evolution is just a bunch of random facts that everyone is forced to believe.""

While I still don't understand his argument, I do know that I should have broken it off right then. This was just the start of me realizing that he lacked critical thinking skills, was completley sheltered, and too stuck in his views to listen to alternative ideas.

If this is a deal breaker for you, then don't feel bad breaking it off. I think the bigger issue though is that you're set to spend the rest of your life with someone that you don't really know that well."
I'd like to say that it's still having a very strong effect on them. We learn what love to accept at a young age. This is why children of abusers tend to either be abused themselves or become abusers in later life. They learn that this behaviour is acceptable and they should try to look for/be better.

"I'd talk it out with them if I were you. I was in your situation a few years ago. I completely destroyed the friendships by lashing out and blaming them for specifically excluding me. If I'd gone into the discussion without immediately judging and accusing them of malice, maybe we'd have gotten somewhere.

Learn from my mistakes. Maybe it was on purpose, or maybe it wasn't. Only way to know is to ask them. No need to shy away from telling them how you feel, though - just use ""I statements"" instead of accusatory ones (example: ""I felt very sad/hurt when I realized that I hadn't been included"" vs ""You didn't include me in the trip. How could you do that to me?"").

Sorry you're going through this. It absolutely sucks."
Thank you.
Their comment history indicates that they're French.
Is there any way you can postpone the wedding until you get a feel for if this is for you or not? By the sounds of it you have already made a tentative decision that you can't love her if it's a permanent change. It's okay to feel that way and would be a reasonable reason for ending the relationship if you can't see past this change. 
"For anyone who thinks you overreacted, the issue wasn't that he showed you the picture (although that would still be super uncool), the issue was that he was laughing the entire time you were screaming and crying and then non-apologized by saying you needed to get over it.

You would never be able to trust that he won't do something like that again since he obviously thinks he did nothing wrong."
"I agree with you. I was with my ex ten years. I felt butterflies for a VERY long time after we were married. He did not. He was also very distant affectionately and told me the lack of butterflies was normal. 

I am now engaged to someone of two years and I don‚Äôt really have butterflies with him anymore, but it feels like home and comfort. I prefer it way more to what I thought was butterflies before. 

I think the excitement I felt with my ex was because kindness and affection were so rare that when he noticed me in a positive light I was over the moon. My current SO is always kind and loving. He feels stable. 

My ex wound up being abusive. I don‚Äôt know what OP‚Äôs situation is, but I would be wary of an SO who doesn‚Äôt care you like to have affection and casually says they don‚Äôt feel excited about you anymore. "
"I feel like this isn‚Äôt really relevant. I don‚Äôt cheat because I love my girlfriend, but moreover I respect the shit out of her as a human being. 

If I were developing feelings for any other person, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs male, female,***tomato*** I would cut it off because before anything a significant other should be a best friend. You don‚Äôt hurt your best friend. If she was having confusing feelings before it‚Äôs her responsibility to talk and his responsibility to try to understand, as tough as that may be."
"I think it would be fine if she went to get the stuff by herself or if she went with the boyfriend. She got the keys from her parents, so she was authorized to get in and it was her stuff. Had her parents refused to let them in or give them OP's things, I think OP would be justified if she decided to call the cops.

Sending BF by himself was a bad idea, IMHO. It's good he didn't get in in the end. I understand that OP wanted her things and that she had the right to get them, but it isn't worth the trouble to try to get the stuff in this way."
"This just seems really passive aggressive.  To single out you alone? Sorry, that's rude - to both of you.

An invitation is just that...its not a summons.   "
"Thank you. This really resonated with me. I've been ""emotionally beaten"" out of a few things during this relationship that just didn't seem big enough to make a stink over. This is not one of them."
"If you want to get more comfortable with this maybe you should work your way up to films? Like start with going to art shows with your boyfriend. Slowly work up until your comfortable or at least don't have this bad of anxiety. Also maybe look at tips to help you work through the anxiety. I think it's sweet you are trying to work through this to spend time with him and his hobby. 

I can honestly say your boyfriend isn't lusting after the characters or comparing them to you.   I know it's hard to get out of that mind frame, but if you want to work towards it with him it'll be worth it.  

When I was  younger I felt similarly uncomfortable with Sex scenes. It took me a while to realize that it was all in my head (a mixture of  being raised religious and my own insecurity). Now I'm at the point I comfortable joking and seeing anything with my current boyfriend.  

I know you mentioned that you are in school in one of your other post. I would look into what resources they have available. I know my school has free therapy sessions and reduce prices for students. Even if you don't use it for this, you might want to use it if school ever gets  super stressful. "

"Honestly, I think this is just a karma-farm account.  This is one of those posts that not only highlights a potential cheater, but also a potential liar.  It's actually a pretty great post, some people want to call this guy out for cheating and some want to call her out for making up some bullshit.

After reading through several other replies, I'm going to have to agree with the inconsistencies of the story, and her lack of motive.

This account is almost two years old, which the only other post being from some dark net meme sub.  We've seen some people talk about buying and selling accounts that were 1-2 years old, but with 1-2k karma.  

Seems like a real long time to hold on to a throwaway around.  Account made almost 2 years ago, and you say to yourself ""oh yeah, I have a throwaway that I made a long time ago where I posted once"".  AND the account is verified.  The only point of a throwaway is to make some sort of anonymity while posting, not this guy though, he is going to go ahead and verify his email address.

"This is a hill I'd be willing to die on.

Based on your other comments, it seems like she thought your engagement took away the attention for her wedding. Honestly the engagement was two months prior, why would she be pissed? It's not like you two got engaged a week before her wedding....


Despite handmaking the dresses, planning, and all that biz, I'd personally tell her to go kick rocks and not go. If I found out that my fiance was a groomsman in his friend's wedding and all the other wedding party folks for a plus one but him, I'd be pissed that you're going. I'd get another ticket for the Bahamas for my man and just have a vacation together, no wedding. 


Your sister only thinks you're horrible for not going because you're in the wedding party. You're not the MoH, don't worry, OP.


You can either go and your fiance realizes that he was purposefully excluded and you KNEW the whole time and he resents you for not standing up for him, or you can tell ""friend"" to suck it and enjoy the Bahamas with your fiance instead and burn the bridge."
"Because one doesn't relate to the other. If I buy a house with 10 deposit, so the mortgage is 90% of the value, and I decide to pay off my mortgage over a 5 year period, my mortgage payments are going to be very high compared to the market rent of the house.

However, if I buy a house with 50% deposit and pay off the 50% mortgage over a 30 year term, my mortgage payments are going to be low compared to the market rent of the house.

Basically, what one pays as mortgage payment has nothing to do with the market rent of a given property. "
Have you considered setting up couples counseling? He might need to hear from a neutral third party how to better support you and to cut you a lot of slack. Being pregnant is exhausting!

Seriously though, if you want to have sex without a condom and not go nuts waiting each month your GF needs to be on birth control. I don't imagine you want to feel the way you're feeling right now again."

Filing a harassment claim is the best way to get her to stop and for it to die down. Honestly if you file it that'll probably be enough to get her to stop in itself, and that way you also have documentation for any future incidents.

You never know with people like this, I really wouldn't put it past her to make up a story about you raping her in the future. Either way get ahead of this and get this documented.

"But your daughter didn't go to her room or an unoccupied, quiet area to calm herself down. . .she walked right into the kitchen, the epicenter of all the commotion and the event.

"Unfortunately I don't have any Scotland specific advice for you, but I just wanted to add a few things.

1) This is absolutely NOT the prime of your life! ""It gets better"" sounds cheesy, but it's so, so true. The fact that you're working for yourself and trying to get the treatment you know you need shows how strong you are, and I know puts you a step ahead of where I was at your age. Whoever made up the idea that your teenage years are the best ones must have been a washed up hack who failed right out of highschool.

2) If you can, try going to a regular family doctor instead of a therapist/counsellor. (or going again if you already have) Your counsellor sounds atrocious, and it sounds like everything needing to go through her is only making things slower. However a GP can prescribe meds on their own if the cause is there. They can also check for hormonal irregularities that can cause depression and anxiety, or just low energy or irritability in general.

Lastly, I'd say when you're being assessed, try not to sugarcoat how you're doing. I know the urge very well to try and repeat the ""it's not so bad"" things you tell yourself, because your instinct is to not have someone worry about you, but try to be clinical about it. Your doctor needs to know what's going on, so be as honest and clear as possible about what you're dealing with.

And if you get unlucky and everyone who should be helping you continues to faff about and let you down, just keep hanging in there."

"Yep; people with tattoos, people who've been to certain countries that have common blood borne viruses and gay people are all barred from donating blood because of the risk.

Edit: they're barred for a certain time period following the event not forever btw. Tattoos it's 4 months, gay sex is 12 months and international travel varies depending on location."
"&gt;It just doesn‚Äôt make sense as to why he just, doesn‚Äôt go for an Asian girl since it seems like he‚Äôs so fascinated with their huge tits and ass (I guess?).

Anime style is not reality. If you honestly think all asians have big tits and asses because of drawn porn then you need to take a big step back."
"I don't understand this. You agreed to an open relationship with no rules except for honesty (that's the biggest mistake you could ever make when starting an open relationship, open relationships have boundaries that need be discusses very extensively). Most people I know in an open relations (and how my and I ex were) are in the swingers lifestyle. They enjoy sharing the experience with their SO and it's safer than having private 1-on-1 sexual relationships. If you're not polyamourous than this type of open relationship is a recipe for disaster. 

You say ""so far I haven't had concrete desire to sleep with someone else"". 
Than why did you want an open relationship? People start open relationship because they already have the desire to have sex with others or really don't believe in the concept of monogamy, which comes with the desire to have sex with others. 
I don't think this was your decision at all as you clearly state that you're afraid him desiring to be intimate with another woman, developing jealous feelings, etc. 

Why don't you just date other men? What's the point of an open relationship if you keep yourself exclusive to your fiancee? Do yourself a favour and put yourself on the market and have your own fun. Start desiring other men! This will not work out in your favourite if you stay monogamous. 

Your fiancee doesn't respect your feelings at all on this. 2 year in a relationship is not a long time. That's nothing to be honest. Really think very well about what you desire in your future husband and what type of relationship you truly desire. 
"
"&gt; makes me see how much of a f-ing idiot I am

It's ok, you are 21, I shudder to remember things I did at 21.

The main thing is you wised up. A tiny bit late, but not disastrously late. Thank god you arent pregnant for example.

End it. You'll be fine."
"are you committed in any way to her? it doesn't sound like you are. it sounds like you're far more invested in doing what you want when you want, which... fair enough

except

whether you're with her or not, your child is going to mess up your wants left and right for the next 20+ years. so sure, it's easy to think 'well I'D like one last weekend out before all that' but guess what?
 sacrificing your wants for others' needs is going to be a constant &amp; if you can't somehow convince yourself that you're not the only person who matters, you're going to have a very unhappy life."
"Well,  he had it coming..."
"I agree. Dump her, man. "
"""Break"" = time-out on relationship juuuuuuust long enough to see if he can fuck the other chick, and if necessary can excuse it later by saying, ""But we were on a break!!"" Gross and manipulative AF."
"You're gonna have to move out.

They will never stop treating you like you're 8 years old until you've moved out. It sucks, but this is the way of things, especially with overbearing folks. 

See if you can get yourself enrolled in some therapy to deal with all those traumatic experiences and get your mind in a healthy place again. Your school probably has a mental health division in their school health area, that might be your cheapest route. 

Try not to be resentful at your sister. It sounds like she didn't have a good life either growing up, knowing all this time how unfair it is to you and being unable to protect you or do anything about it."
When did she last have her period? what's your birth control situation?
"I really don't see how family counseling would be of any use at all in this situation. It's not going to help or designed to help with problems such as these, the counselor would likely even tell OP that he has to respect his daughters boundaries no matter what."
"After that comment I would have eaten my meal, finished my drink, quietly excused myself to the restroom before the check came, called a cab, and block his number on the ride home."
"Is there a school counselor you could talk to? Even if it's not the type of counselor that does therapy, they could probably refer you to some other resources, or possibly help guide the conversation with your mom."

"Or the sad inverse of ""While You Were Sleeping.""

Yeah, OP, details as to the whys of things would help. Does the family blame you for her accident somehow?"
"Your bf is wrong on this.  Probably too late now but he should have said we're getting together, aitan is making her famous (I guess lasagna) you should join us.  He had a crush on you, you weren't married or involved.  They are making this a much bigger deal than it needs to be.  If it really upsets David to be around, well that is on him for hanging on to.......nothing for so long.  "
"Leave it out as if by accident, where they will snoop and see it."
"But this is where this gets tough. He is the dad. Everyone wants to throw the dad under the bus when he *isn't* stepping up, saying 'you made the baby together, it takes two to tango, etc' but this is a situation where you may have a guy who is desperately sad about this choice being out of his control. It's the same politics (they made this baby together), but this time, he has no choice in the matter. I can imagine that would be really tough for a guy who really wants to have a baby. People aren't perfect, especially when faced with something so emotional.

ETA: this doesn't mean at all that I think she should keep this baby for him, ultimately this is her choice to make and he has to deal with it regardless. I think it's a hard situation all around when one person wants the child and another doesn't."
"Wow, what a gal.

And just think! If she has his kid, they get married, build her dream home, all that, she can take the house and half his stuff later when it dawns on her that those things she doesn't like are all of a sudden important!

I realize this is your friend...but that dude needs someone in his court to pull those rose colored glasses off. Your friend is a parasite to this guy."
Depression makes a lot of shit that should be easy really hard.
"My loathing of religion comes from my personal experience with having been a mormon. I was not only punished with religion but it was also forced upon me, whether I believed or not. As I worked my way out of that ~~religion~~ cult, I turned the same reflection and analysis on the rest of Christianity and then that extrapolated out to Abrahamic religions and then that extrapolated out to just about everything else. I even had an experience with paganism/Wicca that made me say, ""Aw, man, this is just a different flavor of the same attempt to have power and control over other people. I'm out."" 

I've seen religion do more damage to people and destroy more families than I've seen it have a productive, positive impact. But I realize the plural of anecdote ‚â† data, so yeah, let's blame the media. It's definitely the media that convinced me, not watching my bishop treat people who were in anguish like complete dogshit. "
" Honestly i bawled through my doctors appointment this afternoon.  It's hitting me and it's horrific and it really,  to quote my doctor,  freaking sucks. I'm definitely getting myself into therapy asap, and have plans with multiple friends to vent, cry, and strategize. "
How is it any different than if I were a woman taking my husband's name? My name wouldn't be seen as important to keep then.
"Yep, I gave up grad school to get married (military and online phD in my field weren't a possibility). Now I'm divorced and finished my degree, wishing I would have just picked education first."
"Equally, not all travelling adventures are great.

I've travelled and had a shit time. I've travelled and had a boring time. I've travelled and had a great time.

Travelling isn't something I'd say is inherently great. 

In this case though, I think she ought to go probably. They can try a LDR if they really want to keep their relationship together."
... because her child is there?
"right.  When I was 21, the idea of dating a divorced guy (even if he was young) was completely out of the question.  Now at 29, if I were single (knock wood as I hope I'm happily with my husband forever), I'd gladly date a divorced guy or single dad if I was otherwise attracted.  I have no idea how a really young person tolerates that level of baggage."
He has his son less than one day a month? Geez.
"I know this sucks, but next time please believe her when she says she feels nothing romantic and leave the grand gestures to the romcoms. :\"

"Maybe she only loved school because she thought she found a way to game the system -cheating. I mean, do you think the three times she got caught were the only times she cheated? Not likely. 

I wouldn't exactly apologize, because she's the one who did something wrong. But you could try explaining that you didn't mean for adults to see the video (but she might not be receptive to that), or just bring her something - a favorite little treat of hers or something, or ask her if she's doing okay? If she freezes you out, maybe just give her some space."
"Keeping this baby will probably end your relationship as well. You'll end up stuck and resentful and miserable, but leaving will be much harder. Keeping a baby you don't want to keep your boyfriend happy is just a recipe for a complicated life where the two of you likely end up divorced from the resentment, but you can never stop dealing with each other because of the kid. And on top of that, your child ends up with a mother who didn't really want it and whose life was messed up by it's birth, and growing up knowing that their birth ended their parents' relationship. This is a terrible situation, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. "
"&gt; Just like some people are pro-life, but for everyone else.

This is one of the best descriptions of the pro-life movement I've ever seen."
The sister got herself expelled when she decided to repeatedly cheat and throw away her second and third chance.  
Then you didn't really do anything wrong. Your sister did the cheating and your mom was the snitch. I'd just keep my head down and stay out of it if I were you; they'll both get over it eventually.
"I totally agree.. except that the argument to respect her is going to happen. For sure, he is doing this on purpose because he either likes irritating her, or worse, he wants her to let him be in control and this is a passive aggressive power trip. Either way, this is going to come up in a real flurry at some point and I would very much like the update when it does. "
Based off a few sentences I feel 100% comfortable saying this situation is a big yikes and you should find someone who respects you and your relationship. Time to take out the trash girl! 
"Still litter. Hopefully you're joking and if so, ""haha""."
"This sort of behavior is repulsive. I've noticed similar behavior, although I was not the person at risk. there are frankly too many examples of abusive relationships here. It is a rural area with high rates of poverty and very backwards attitudes of what is acceptable. A man getting drunk and throwing his wife or girlfriend around or throwing tantrums and following her to work or social events happens a lot. People brush it aside as 'not their business' or 'well everyone has problems. We just have to deal with it.' These same people cheer on 'metoo' and act very enlightened and moral right up until the situation becomes personal and it is a friend or loved one. I hate it. People are capable of extreme hypocrisy and I don't trust anyone anymore. When the chips are down they just do what is most convenient."
"Sounds like your parents purposely raised you to not expect too much from them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Kinda sad that you wouldn‚Äôt even expect them to help you in a situation like this, but I understand your perspective."
"And honestly as a male supervisor, I would never dream of doing a review with a female employee in a restaurant. A man taking a woman out to lunch to discuss her career ambitions just reeks of impropriety, whether intentional or not. I'll eat at my desk after your review in my office, where I'm within earshot of the secretary and safely on camera not doing anything wrong, lol. "
I actually thought this was the same guy with a new story.  I remember that one as well and it's really sad to see how poorly people treat their spouses.
"&gt; However, my girlfriend who is black seems convinced that I don't want to watch it because I am Caucasian.

Is that really what she said?

C'mon dude, it's like 3 or so hours of your life. Just suck it up. It's not a major commitment to make your girlfriend happy for a bit. 

My boyfriend is into classic cars. I couldn't care less but for his birthfay I got him tickets to a car show and we went together. That's what people do in relationships. "
"&gt; People here pay for houses for 30 years or more (as said, they are insanely expensive). 

Same in Europe. Same in the USA.  The sooner you start, the sooner it'll be over.

&gt;I am not going to rush into getting one just because I want my own place.


Fine, then as we keep saying: suck it up. You are lucky and priviledged that your parents let you live there. Be grateful. This is one tiny tiny thing you can do for them.  

And stop spending money on rocks and start saving for your own place, or you'll never move out.

"
"I've already had one opportunity to travel and I know I loved it immensely, and that was for two weeks. 

I would love the chance to see it all with him honestly. "
"I think that is a valid point.  i don't think i'm ready to do that for a few months.  it is our last little one it seems, and she is emotional about a lot of those ""this is the last time"" moments and savoring that part of motherhood."
"Why would you ever be friends with a girl like that, shame on you.

Tell the guy that he is being used, and needs to break up."
"When I was a young child tucked up in bed listening to my drunk Dad hitting my Mum I didn‚Äôt feel safe or protected. Just so you‚Äôre aware.

I personally think you need to respect your sons request and leave him alone. Maybe if you‚Äôre lucky he‚Äôll come back to you one day, but that‚Äôs not up to you. You have to live with the consequences of your bad decisions. "
"It's hard. I don't mean to be harsh but making excuses is what you did last time. Best to do it right now. A firm decision. 

You can stay ""friends"" with her if you want (results may vary). But you would be free to invest your emotional energy elsewhere. You found love in the past and you will find love in the future."
My adopted children were removed permanently from their lovely sweet mother because she stayed in a violent marriage. My children were never hit but god damn we are getting intensive therapy to help them through PTSD and anxiety that they still have two years after being removed from that hell. I can‚Äôt imagine how messed up your son is after two decades of living like that. Leave him alone. 
"That man isn't a father, merely a sperm donor. Pathetic."
"Your family are grade-A scumbags. 

I work with a fire department, and this type of behavior absolutely INFURIATES me. Whenever theres a fire theres always a report on the fire after the investigation. When a fire is particularly large and/or involves a fatality, wanna guess what a common aspect is? Non-functional smoke detectors. Disabling alarms is how people DIE, combined with the fact theyre leaving candles unattended and smoking inside is greating a markedly increased fire risk in your home. So your family being cute is not only endangering THEIR lives, but YOUR lives, as well as any Fire-Rescue personnel who may be called to fight the fire that could have been prevented or discovered early.

If anything your husband UNDERreacted; I once caught someone trying to remove one of my smoke alarm batteries during a halloween party to power silly prop they had and kicked them out right then and there, and let them know in plain terms they werent welcome back for several months. 

So yeah, apologies to your husband for your shit family and get on his side here."
"I was an EMT back in the day, and very vividly remember going to a housefire as backup that started *exactly* this way. Everyone thankfully was ok and there were no injuries, but the teen girl who left the candle burning just looked shattered, and I could tell her mom was trying to keep her own emotions of anger and relief (that it wasn't worse) in check. At least half the house was significantly damaged, eesh. "
"Of course white sexism and homophobia are rooted in culture. But as someone who came from a white cultural background like that, I actually think OP's right that it's complicated. You can disagree with and push back on the problematic aspects of your culture, while also still loving your family, despite the fact that they have some fucked up views. I totally understand why she doesn't want to give up her close family relationships, and she can't wave a magic wand to make them agree with her all of a sudden; even if they do change, it's going to be a slow process of planting the seeds and waiting for them to sprout. There is a difference between excusing people's behavior and trying to negotiate fundamental cultural and value differences with people you love despite the fact that they have some awful beliefs on certain topics.

She can ask them not to tell homophobic jokes around the kid, and if her kid ends up being queer, she can go scorched earth at that point if she needs to. And if some other kid in the family ends up gay or bisexual, it will mean a LOT to have people like OP to turn to. 

Edit: I mean, look at some of OP's comments, where she says stuff like this:

&gt; ""My grandmother went from someone who couldn't be in the same room as a gay person to celebrating the Supreme Court decision [legalizing gay marriage], mostly due to my influence. It is still a work in progress, though. I'd love if my family could automatically stop making insensitive comments, but we're a ways off from that. But I'm not willing to keep my child from my whole family because they are imperfect or because they are still learning. And I wish my husband could separate issues,if not for their sake but for mine."" 

She's not just letting this shit go, and she is slowly helping broaden their perspectives. It just isn't quick or simple or easy. That sounds *exactly* like the way it's gone with my family, and thank god I'd slowly chipped away at my parents' homophobia over many years, because my cousin ended up coming out as gay. Change doesn't happen overnight but it can still happen."
[deleted]
An overreaction of this magnitude is not expected of a teenager. A teenager is old enough to not smash a plate of hot food out of a person‚Äôs hands.
Yeah I don't even understand how that escalated so quickly. Does this stuff actually happen?!  I would suspect she's encountered that guy before.
"It's only complicated because they feel a ""cultural"" attachment to the bad behavior. In practice it's not that hard. Culture and bigotry are both labels we apply to individual behaviors and they are not mutually exclusive. Just because a behavior is fairly described as culture that does not make it any less bigoted. 

As far as parenting goes, ultimately the choices are up to the parents and the parents alone. OP's spinelessness with the boundaries on which they seem to agree is the only thing complicating the situation. If a family member can't respect the current boundaries they should very quickly be finding themselves checked and the boundaries pushed back further."
"This makes me feel a lot better about myself because I thought *I* was an immature 30 yo woman. 

But dang, I got nothing on this lady."
"&gt; She was more sexy at the ""photo time"" in large part because she felt much more confident and comfortable

And do you think that you being ""disappointed"" in how she looks will help her be more confident?

I hope she doesn't marry you."
"Hey! I‚Äôm in a similar place; half Latina, white husband, daughter, cultural conflicts. 

This is what I do with my husband - we talk about potential conflicts with my family and our shared values as a family. We talk about cultural expectations and how we‚Äôll approach them with a united front, discuss dialogues and talking points. 

My family says something sexist/racist/homophobic around our daughter, we say ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt talk like that around her. We don‚Äôt want her to grow up thinking that is an appropriate thing to say.‚Äù 

My family insists we cut her hair/pierce her ears/put makeup on her, we say ‚Äúwe want that to be an experience she chooses for herself.‚Äù

It really goes both ways too. His family has their own fair share of ignorant/backwards thinking. His family tries to shame her about the bobo, or her potty training schedule, or how she sleeps. 

But it‚Äôs about us both being on the same page about parenting and communicating that to our families.  We‚Äôre responsible for talking to our own families about issues, and we back each other up. 

My husband knows how important family is on my side, and how they are in child rearing (I lived with my mom in my 20s for a year after my brother was born to help out). We live in different countries so my family can‚Äôt be that involved but he never begrudges her time with my parents. 

But the important part is we discuss things and come to a solution together that respects both of our cultures. We still have arguments but we work them out together. 

Happy to talk more on this, time to put her to bed!"
"I mean this in the least patronising way possible, but no they don't owe you an explanation. You found out as you eavesdropped. Not your relationship and its not your place to know what's going on. "
"I come from a latin background, and let me say that from my experience you don't change things like racism, sexism or anti-gay sentiments in a family by gently nudging them in one direction and hoping that whatever you gently suggest takes roots. The thing is your husband also can't be the one to stand firm or shoot down those things because he's viewed as an outsider. You have to be the one to do it and be firm about it, and you have to be the first to do it too. 

The only compromise I would ask of your husband is that he not shoot down the more harmless aspects of the way they behave. Like the old wives tails, grandmas cures and all that. If it's not harmful to the baby in any way, but makes your family feel better about things, that's an alright compromise. 

But the last last last thing you should do is let them continue with their bigoted chiding and jokes around your child without standing up to them, rather than making your husband be the one to do so. This, like many other people have already mentioned, will just make him seem like the outsider trying to force change and the enemy. "
"So bizarre. 

I‚Äôm not sure of your family dynamics but as a former wedding planner this is strange. Unless there was some falling out or another singular issue with you mom, etiquette wise it‚Äôs super rude to not invite her when all of her siblings were. 

It‚Äôs unbelievably rude that your cousin addressed this in such a public way. It should have been done one on one or better yet, cousins dad should have discussed it with his sister (your mom). 

As others have said there is nothing you can do especially since you weren‚Äôt invited either. In your shoes I would try to plan something fun for you two to do together on the day of the wedding so she doesn‚Äôt sit at home and dwell on it. 

No matter what I would be a good listening ear for your mom and anyone else who feels slighted, but don‚Äôt stoke the fire. Gossip like this can fly through a family and you don‚Äôt want your name added to the list of ‚Äúwell Op is pissed at you as well...‚Äù even if you are. "
"Thanks. I‚Äôm really not in a good headspace to be dating, I think, based on how guilty I feel about this. I guess I just assumed he would still wear a condom, you know?

He seemed confused when I brought it up, like because I couldn‚Äôt get pregnant and we‚Äôre both clean what‚Äôs the big deal. But I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt really know him that well and it‚Äôs kind of a trust thing for me."
"&gt;  the other part wonders if it's really fair to let other people talk me into this even if it's something I might enjoy.

Listen to this part.

What you may not have expressed to your poly friends is that your husband didn't *ask* if you wanted to do this. You never expressed any interest in a gang bang. He just *told* you it was going to happen, and pouted when you protested. And that is something that everyone involved in responsible kink knows is absolutely wrong.

A more minor but also important point is that he chose this activity for your birthday. It is the ultimate ""I bought this for you for me"" move, and reeks of selfishness.

I think you need to see a sex-positive therapist, because while your husband's sexual interests are not wrong, the way he is going about his sexual interests is completely wrong and possibly leading to danger."
"&gt; sterilisation of a woman is actually less effective than an IUD 

REALLY?  Are you sure?  well shit. TIL. If you are right."
I meant during the first month that she wasn't at all this needy of me. I'm surprised how much more she wanted to spend time with me after that first month.
"&gt; He seemed normal at first, until that

....Except the ""2 failed marriages"", the ""5 kids"", and the ""asked to give up parental rights"" parts, right? 

REALLY that sounds normal to you? 

Sounds like ""dumpster fire"" to me. You need to seriously re-evaluate how you approach relationships. Good lord I feel bad for your kids."
"That's interesting. The friend I mentioned also comes from a similar family. I understood his nonchalance about drinking when his grandmother offered to buy me ""wake-up beer"" at 8 am.

Your fiance sounds like a ""black-out"" alcoholic. The kind that doesn't need to drink all the time but really goes overboard when he does. I would recommend you talk to him about getting help, which is not going to be an easy conversation because you'll probably be the first one who have brought up this issue in his life.

(Or maybe this has nothing to do with alcohol and he's just an irresponsible guy who flakes on things... which is somehow worse than being an alcoholic because it would probably take more effort to fix that.)"
"If it's any consolation, he'll probably end up in a nursing home someday, wearing diapers and shitting himself, remembering the time he dumped someone because she couldn't hold it in for 2 hours."
"&gt; I get the sentiment of what you‚Äôre saying, but getting a dog is nothing like signing up for a legally binding commitment 

They would be getting engaged, not married yet."
"You don't get her back. You blew that bridge up with a nuke.

Grow up. Learn from this. Treat the next person better. "
"what awful advice. He treated this woman like garbage, she's not going to forgive him. She SHOULD NOT forgive him."
"Honestly thank you guys for the wake up call, i do feel a lot better about it now"
"Payments towards a car if its on loan, phone bill, car insurance and running costs, credit cards payments if she has any, loans to family maybe. It can all add up.

Mine come out a little over ¬£500 a month due to a period of unemployment and wasn't entitled to any help and unfortunately I'm paying the price of that still. "
"Same, also thought vore immediately after 'can only be drawn'. It appears to be less rare than I initially thought."
Many (maybe even most) women aren't willing/ready to leave their babies for an hour a week after they're born. 
"Tell people the real story instead. It's easier for him to blame you as a emotional pregnant than to admit he was so dumbfoundedly scared that you were going into labor, that he denied it, and had things not been going smoothly up until the parking lot, could have seriously hurt all three of you. How he's acting is definitely not okay and I think he needs to get reprimanded a bit by others and not just you so he knows how serious a situation he put you all in. I knew a couple who gave birth on the free way to their second child. Both parents were ready and on their way to the hospital it's just that the second time you have a baby they tend to come a little  quicker sometimes, so they didn't make it and baby was born on the free way. No one thinks it's cool or funny that that happened , maybe when the kid is a teen they will, but that terrified them both that they gave birth on the freeway. At least you made it to the hospital lot but had he listened, you would have been in a room with a epidural, much more comfortable, and safe. "
"Completely Agree. Be glad your rid of her. I would rent a storage shed for two months and move her stuff into it. I would send her the key for it and tell her in a letter she has two months to get her things or the storage company will take care of them. 

I would also block her and smile. You just dodged the biggest bullet of your life. Be thankful you didn't marry her or have kids with her. Its a living nightmare dealing with my xW all the time over the kids. Thankfully they will be 18 soon and that connection will drop out of my life forever. 



"
You should get smarter friends. 
"Alcohol can totally change this, though.

If you're all ordering $30-$40 mains and drinking water or soft drink, then helping to cover an entree or something is cool.

If Gwen is on her 4th Margarita and eyeing off the dessert menu while you had half a taco and tap water, it's time to split cheques and stare that [human] down."
"No. You put the kabosh to the plans. She doesn't want to see you at 12:30 am when you get out of work, and I don't blame her. You told her you were only working until 2, but then changed those plans too. You're unreliable and she's rightfully pissed, so she cancelled plans completely. You told her you'd spend the whole weekend with her, and then messed up plans twice. Next time, stick to the work schedule you told her. If work asks you to stay late, say no. You're the asshole in this situation, nice job trying to put it on your girlfriend though. "
"Here's the thing with high school boyfriends.  Statistically, there's a very low chance that you'll stay together til marriage (not impossible, but very unlikely).  *When* you two break up, you won't regret having been in the relationship and you won't regret the time you spent together, but the relationship will fade in your memory and the few extra months or years you were together won't mean that much more than the time you've been together already.

On the other hand, living across the world (for months, not even weeks!) is an experience that will influence the rest of your life and even your children's lives, if you have them.  My mother took the opportunity to live and work in another country for several months when she was 18 (leaving a boyfriend to do so) and I grew up on stories of her exotic experiences and travels.  Those stories influenced me greatly, I've traveled a lot as a result, and I can even remember details from those stories years after hearing them.  If you asked me the name of the boyfriend she broke up with in order to travel, I would have no clue (hell, even my mother probably doesn't remember at this point, many boyfriends, 1 husband, and 2 children later).

It's hard, and a lot of people choose their current emotions over long-term logic, so at the end of the day only you can decide what to do.  I just wanted to give you some perspective as someone who was affected not by my own choice to travel, but someone else's."
"You *need* to recover those text messages. If you‚Äôre really thinking of staying with him, you need the *whole* truth. You can‚Äôt trust him not to trickle-truth you."
You are in a crazy amount of denial. 
"As someone who was dumped with my exs friends there, I totally agree. It was the most horrifyingly humiliating experience of my life and it still haunts me to this day. Do not dump someone this way."
Of course he doesn't. He's got some toxic view of marriage. He's acting all surprised and dumbfounded. He knows what he's doing.

"&gt;&gt; After all, she is the same person I fell in love with. Nothing hasn't changed practically.

"Rent a hotel room for the weekend and go study there instead of at home. If you are worried they‚Äôll try to catch you after work pack up tonight, take your luggage to work tomorrow, and then head straight to the hotel that afternoon. That way they can‚Äôt try to guilt you through the front door into letting them in and having an unpleasant and unproductive confrontation because y‚Äôall won‚Äôt be inside. You might want to block their numbers and avoid social media for the weekend too to prevent harassment. At the hotel you guys can fully focus on your studies in peace and not have the threat of surprise visitors hovering all weekend. 

You guys explicitly told them that you don‚Äôt have time to deal with them this weekend and that they should not come down. If they choose to ignore that information and end up traveling six hours for nothing then that‚Äôs their own damn fault. "

Yes I tried that last Saturday I went out for pretty much the day. From noon until 6 p.m. and I received a few phone calls and text asking me when I was going to be home and by the time I got home our son was already in his room because my husband needed a break and it wasn't even his bedtime

"&gt;Is there anything I can do?

Yes, you can vaccinate your kids. Your sister believes that you're endangering your children and the people around them and doesn't want to associate with someone who does that.

Imagine that you found out that your sister beats her children and refuses to stop doing it. Would you want to be around her?"
"The thing about anti-vaxxers, is it's always, always, the tip of the iceberg when it comes to dumb shit they believe. I can see her thought process.

If you want to not vaccinate your kids and cure their polio and tetanus with essential oils and homoeopathy, knock yourself out. But no one else is obligated to have that nonsense in their life."

She blocked you out of Shame. You caught her, she was busted. She feels deeply ashamed. 

Nobody who gets busted and feels ashamed wants to face the person who caught them. Why would she do that? So that you could tell her what a piece of garbage she is? Of course that will feel good to you, of course you want to final confrontation with her. It will do nothing for her except remind her that she cheated on you and that she's garbage. Why would she open herself up to that? There is no benefit to her in doing that.

"My dude, your husband is full-blown psycho. He is abusing you, and poor Tweety. You need to leave- you and the bird. You can't wait that long. *HE* won't wait that long.

You need to start figuring out your exit plan, which includes:

1) changing all your passwords to bank, social media, email, and other online accounts- also separate your cellphone from him if you can, if you leave he will shut anything joint you share off to hurt you

2) locking him out of your money or moving your money into an account with only your name on it

3) gathering and protecting all of your important documents, belongings, and valuables

4) contacting the best divorce lawyer you can find and meeting with them to explain your situation and ask for guidance, both about visa issues and the divorce proceedings

5) being prepared for an emergency by knowing how to get to the nearest women's shelter

6) being emotionally prepared to call the cops on him and file charges if he hits you or the bird, which he is escalating to

7) beginning counseling or join an abuse survivor's group to try to heal from the emotional damage he's been doing to you, you will make allies there that can help you through this


You need to protect yourself from this person, especially while you are doing these steps. Start squirreling money away in hidden places, hide your emergency go-bag in your car or office, don't let him find out you are doing this for your own safety."

"Definitely! He is not sending you this content to be malicious. He genuinely thinks you enjoy it and when he sees a meme he goes, ""oh, iamnottheuser will probably get a kick out of this and laugh!

It's not malicious that you want to show Spirited Away to your SO even though he hates animated moves, right? Same thing here.

The poster above you is trying to help you avoid feeling trapped down the line. They‚Äôre giving you really good advice that will allow your relationship to grow without creating dependency.
"One thing that stood out to me was OP mentioning the difficulties his wife faced when breastfeeding. I'm sure this will royally peeve off the hardcore breastfeeding proponents, but most (reasonable) people know formula is there for a reason. If the wife is struggling with breastfeeding, formula does exist, and it works fine. I think that there is so much pressure on women to breastfeed now, it's rather ridiculous. 

I guess it came from people defending their right to breastfeed, but the pendulum swung too far the opposite direction, and now people are out there that legitimately think it's abuse to not breastfeed a baby, no matter what the reasoning for using formula. I actually had someone tell me that she has allergies to certain foods, and if her mom had breastfed her, she wouldn't have to deal with those now. SHE HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT! It's become insane at times, the pressure on new moms to breastfeed NO.MATTER.WHAT!  If someone is already struggling with all sorts of different issues, and breastfeeding is extremely difficult, to the point that it is compounding other issues, maybe it is time to consider supplementing? 


That's only if OP and his wife decide to have another baby though.

"And OP, his ex isn't draining his finances, HE IS.

Do you want to dependent on a person like that?"

"Well, since you want to deflate the situation, not draw up the battle lines, I would avoid using such strong words as inappropriate. She seems to be on a high horse and being called inappropriate would probably not sit well with her. 

Something along the line of ""Hey, about those notes, they don't feel very homey to me and I feel worried that there are problems that we should talk about so that we can all get on board with how we deal with them, I don't want there to be resentment in our cosy home. :)
Could we have a group meeting where we talk about it?""

I get that you feel that this was uncalled for and you don't seem to like her or agree that there are problems, but this is where you live, in this situation it is more important to find an for all parties included agreeable peace than to be right and get the last word.

"The Harper's Bazaar article on emotional labor called ""Women Aren't Nags‚ÄîWe're Just Fed Up"" was extremely impactful to me."
"I think both of your positions here are completely understandable.  On one hand, the tattoo is old news for you.  On the other hand, it's new news for her and she's understandably skittish at rekindled toxicity.

I also had a deep and toxic relationship with an ex-gf that eventually turned into a rekindled friendship.  I was also really on edge at the beginning, looking for any sign that she was ""still like that"", and would probably have felt really similar if I'd found out she had the tattoo.

So from that position, I will say:  I think it's worth you having a mutual friend reach out that explain exactly when you got the tattoo, you've been mortified by it, and haven't been able to afford to get it covered.  

She's afraid of more things than are actually true at this point. So I think the amount of peace you can give her by explaining the tattoo overrides the amount of peace lost from breaking NC.

The safest thing to do is to have a mutual friend that she feels safe with do the reachout.  Just say, ""Hey, Monica just wanted me to convey that she's going to respect your not wanting to talk to her.  But, just so you know, the tattoo is really old and she got it right after you broke up and feels bad about it.  She just doesn't have the money to remove it, but wants to as soon as possible.""

"I believe you that you haven't cheated. Because guess what, many people don't. 


But you don't like or trust your girlfriend. So why date her?


This post seems like it's just a forum for you to talk about how awful your girlfriend is.


And, even in a functional relationship, marriage should be discussed in detail before proposal."
"But that's a completely different situation. Your sister based her decision on logistics, and Lisa seems very deliberate, almost as though she wanted hurt her aunt. The drama really isn't from the fact that she's not invited, but the why."
"&gt; tl;dr: I'm a teacher, my girlfriend wants me to go back to school so I can start a higher paying career, I don't really want to

You have two choices:

1. Lose the girlfriend who obviously isn't satisfied with you nor respects you enough to accept your path in life

or

2. Go back to school to do hard work and possibly fall into debt that will take a long time to pay off, just to work (aka suffer) in a career **you do not like** just for the approval of someone who is supposed to love you unconditionally... and STILL has the option of leaving you without guilt **even after doing everything she wanted you to do**.

Sounds like an easy choice to me.

&gt; She is Indian and has a different view of dating than I do.

Then why did she choose to date you?

&gt; She‚Äôs more clinical, and is insistent that her partner makes above a certain threshold.

This is an *excellent* view on life and she is *EXACTLY* the type of woman you should want to start a life with  /s
Again, she KNEW YOUR JOB BEFORE DECIDING TO DATE YOU. So again, *why is she dating you*?

&gt; This is nothing new, she was very open about that from the start, but we started dating more casually and it just turned more serious with time.

Again, this woman does not sound LTR material at all. Her actions OPENLY clash with her words. She clearly says she wants a man who makes more, KNEW YOU WERE NOT THAT MAN, and *still* dated you? 

WHY?

It sounds like she believe you were soft and easily manipulative enough for her to force you to become the man she obviously can't attract on her own. Do not prove her right.

&gt; I had hoped she would warm up the longer she was in the ‚ÄòStates, but obviously expecting her to change wasn‚Äôt fair.

It was at THAT moment you should've broken up and cut ties with her. Never start a relationship with someone hoping that they would change for the better.

&gt; she absolutely hates that I‚Äôm ‚Äúwasting my potential‚Äù as a teacher

Is this what YOU think about yourself? The only person who matters when it comes to judging your potential is YOU. Definitely not someone who can leave you at any time.

&gt; She also has an absolutely toxic reaction when I suggest I‚Äôm relatively okay with making 45k.

Do you really *need* any more reasons to leave this toxic excuse for a human being behind?

&gt; She is also dismissive when I try to talk about work or the attachments I have with my students.

Brilliant communication skills. Definitely marriage material right here.      /s

&gt; She is a huge part of my life

How? Why? Someone who openly despises what you do (and like to do) for a living is a huge part of your life?

&gt; we live together

Another mistake. 

&gt; I could spend my life with her

You would have to be a FOOL to even consider this at this point. 




If you decide to stay with this woman, you are signing yourself up for a life with a woman who will never respect you and never love you, and will always make you feel like less of a man. If you enjoy being looked down upon or forced to make life decisions you don't want to make, she would be perfect for you."
"Yep. OP sweeps red flags under the rug and dives into relationships headfirst. That much is painfully clear. People like OP are a magnet for shady, unstable partners. 

OP, I think you‚Äôre more attached to the idea of a relationship than you are to the day-to-day realities of being with this woman. You have a picture in your head (‚Äúslayed the dragons‚Äù ‚Äúrescue the princess‚Äù) that you‚Äôll happily insert any willing woman into, while disregarding the traits that would cause cracks in that image. That‚Äôs how you keep ending up blindsided by infidelity - the train was rattling and clacking and leaning on the horn as it barreled towards you, but you‚Äôre wearing headphones and listening to Beethoven and ‚Äúdamn that train noise is annoying, I‚Äôll just turn up the volume a little bit more.‚Äù 

Stop ignoring the warning signs. Stop barreling into relationships with people who show you early that they‚Äôre not trustworthy. Stop using ‚Äúwell everyone has their flaws‚Äù as a way to ignore abusive or trust-destroying behavior. This is not ‚Äúalways leaves socks on the floor‚Äù or ‚Äúis chronically 10 minutes behind schedule.‚Äù Not all flaws are equivalent, and it‚Äôs high time you learned which ones are automatic dealbreakers.

"This is incredibly sad that you think this man. It's sad that the poster thinks this as well.

Breaks ups aren't supposed to be about ""winning"" or getting one over on the other person. They are often painful for both sides. Did you ever think to consider that *maybe* this has been painful for her? And *maybe* she made a drunk text mistake - something that I would guess a lot of people in their 20's and 30's have done. And now she realizes that the wound which was healing was ripped wide open again?

Honestly don't listen to this person. They sound sad and incredibly callous. Don't be that bitter person, move on with your life"
Really well said and a great point to remember! 
"I think you are misrepresenting her confidence. She is displaying signs that she is NOT CONFIDENT. A girl who is confident in herself doesn't seek outwards validation from other men with sexual/romantic interest when she is in a relationship. 

Set some ground rules. Don't treat yourself like a victim. Just say ""I am not okay with this. If you want to keep doing this, we will have to end our relationship"". This is a dealbreaker for most people, and her being immature about it shows a lot about her. Set your feet down."
"She's probably thinking of her hen not as ""all the bridesmaids except sis."" She's probably thinking of it as ""all my friends who I partied with."" She wants to have a wild-ish night with people she used have wild nights with. You're her sister - you two know each other in a very different way than ""party pals."" It sounds like she wants a last hurrah with her wild buddies, regardless of bridesmaid status. But she wanted to include everyone in some type of celebration, so that's why she had the spa day. It wasn't a ""decoy party,"" just a different one."
it really sounds like her sister came up with a compromise in am attempt to be thoughtful to all involved while still getting to have fun as the bride deserves.
"For real, I've never interacted with a baby for longer than a couple minutes at a time, put a diaper on one, etc. and even my ass knows you don't stick the tape to the baby.  No one thinks that.  That's 100% manipulation so he doesn't have to change diapers.  It's like my dad ""not knowing how to fold women's clothes"" so my mom wouldn't ask him to do laundry."
I wonder whether he's secretly a religious nut imposing his view on OP.
Maybe you should terminate the pregnancy. I think your phobia and mental health are more important 
Yeah you made your bed in terms of being with him for so long. But lying in it doesn't mean being with him forever. It could also mean having to have the awkward chats with people that you'd broken up. Or mean having to tell him to get the fuck out of your bank accounts and life.
Maybe she is tired as shit. 
Kind people don't do shit that makes their significant other feel like shit after their significant other has talked to them. 
"I can‚Äôt blame your family at all after what they saw you go through. There are over 6 billion people on this planet. Regardless of how much this guy appears to have reformed, why did you go back to your abuser?"
"Look, it‚Äôs completely okay to have boundaries. This isn‚Äôt just a normal job. This is doing sexual things with other men. You‚Äôre allowed to not be okay with it. Ultimately if you say yes when you are uncomfortable, it could lead to more problems in the relationship. You can‚Äôt stop her from doing it, but you should be honest if it‚Äôs a deal breaker or not. "
Dad: It is not a woman's responsibility to avoid being raped. IT IS A MAN'S RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT RAPE!  Jesus fucking Christ. 
"Uh... he‚Äôs 16!!! That changes everything! If you are 20 or 21, whichever one you actually really are, that‚Äôs predatory. Why did you change this post to say he was 18? And in your last post you said something along the lines of him being different than most teens his age. 

Disturbing."
"Agreed. I also have Asperger‚Äôs, and I baby my bf tons when he‚Äôs sick."
"Hey, op. Not sure if this is a good idea but. Was this convo with her in person or on the phone? If so you could try asking her her side again and see if there are inconsistencies in her story. Same with bf. 

Besides that you could have a convo with your bf. Tell him that if this marriage starts out on a lie then it will inevitably fail. Does he really want to start a marriage like that or does he want to take responsibility for his actions? If he cheated then this may be a good way to draw the truth out. 

Other than that it could very well be possible that this girl is jealous. 

Best of luck, op!"
"Yeah. I doubt that on the day of the wedding, the other people who were given plus ones would even give a second thought to the bride not giving OP a plus one. It would probably just go in one ear, out the other. Or they might pick up on the fact that there is friction between OP and the bride, but it seems futile in either case. "
"Ironically, my shitty horrible mother did this exact same thing to me when I was little.  My dad said she was playing the music in the vehicle so loud that I started doing my pain wail.

"Why would you be ok with never having a honeymoon period? When you start dating someone and they immediately treat you this way, you don't keep dating them. That is your signal that this person and you are not compatible, which is ok. You're not obligated to continue dating them or try to make it work. Expecting him to change is naive. This is him at his ""best"" behavior, don't expect anything to go up from here. "
"You need to open your eyes. There is no saving this relationship, because it's only a relationship to you and not him. Cut your losses and move on."
""" I've never known her to be anything but 100% honest and caring.""

Well she clearly isn't. She either had sex with your bf, or made it up, both of which are really bad.

I'd wager that if your bf had a random one night stand with a friend of yours that originated from him being out walking the dog, he'll have likely done it before. Maybe you can check his phone / chat programs etc. for evidence of *that*."
"You echo my feelings perfectly. I could feel the OP's contempt for his wife right off the bat. Talking about how she's ""desperate to impress"" and she doesn't even get a name. God, maybe she's just craving a little fun with other adults so she can live a little, the horror!

And they get zero counseling, and as far as I know, no professional help for Noelle. There are people out there that can work with Noelle and teach her coping mechanisms and how to better function in society. A family friend has a young adult daughter with severe autism, and while I don't think she'll ever be completely independent, she works with professionals to learn strategies to help her. What she never did was make the world stop and revolve around her, pitting her parents against each other and retaining her disruptive behaviors from when she was much younger (like hours-long screaming meltdowns, etc). By the time she was a teenager, she could be present at a function without ruining it. 

He sat with Noelle on the floor for *hours*. It feels like he is enabling her to stay regressed and childlike, while also looking down at his wife for her very normal feelings, and also denying that Noelle is as regressed as she is. She is in no way ready for college. Noelle doesn't go to her room because why should she, she gets all the attention and excuses from Dad she could ever want."
"I suppose I don't get why you'd wait until right before the surgery to clue him in on this. Presumably you're worried about how it will be received-- so wouldn't it be better to find out now if he'd have some sort of undesirable reaction to your plans, as opposed to finding out after spending a year and a half with this person? Seems like you could just mention it casually that you have these plans now instead of waiting. "
"OP, I hope you see this.   You need to ***get out***.

Violence like this does not go away or get better without some serious outside intervention. In fact, it escalates. The end game here is your death. That is where this pattern ends. It ends when he kills you, or you get out. PLEASE get somewhere safe, OP, and break it off. See an attorney and begin divorce proceedings. Do not warn him, do not tell him where you are. You are in a very precarious position. Please, PLEASE get yourself out."
"At college you don't get your own bathroom and man, when you really need that, it's a nightmare."
"I had a few autistic friends in college, all on various points within the spectrum so they all had their own coping mechanisms that worked for them. One, who was especially sensitive to loud noises, would wear ear plugs to class - it doesn't keep you from being able to hear the professor, but will cut down on louder distractions. Another would bring their favorite stuffed animal to stim with during lecture - you'd think people would laugh but honestly they got more compliments than anything. To be fair, it's a really cute and soft stuffed bunny.

I think the most revealing statement OP made was in another comment:

&gt;We‚Äôve learned the cues she gives us when she‚Äôs getting overwhelmed so we can try to stop it before it gets too far, but sometimes our minds are elsewhere.

The parents seem to always be stepping in and soothing her, rather than having her learn to take care of herself. Noelle is obviously self-aware because she can recognize when she's starting to feel overstimulated, but the lesson her parents have been teaching her every time they ""handle the problem for her"" is that she is incapable of doing it herself. This is probably not intentional, but that's what she's been learning. She definitely needs to seek out therapy if she's not in it already, because she will not learn good coping skills unless something changes drastically."
"I saw him at a restaurant once, and you'll be happy to know that he treated the staff with politeness, grace, and humor. You could tell that he'd been there before and they were happy to see him again."
"He‚Äôs always chuckled at my ‚Äúaversion‚Äù (his words, not mine) to plastic surgery because it‚Äôs so common here. He‚Äôs asked in the past if I would ever consider a breast implants or a nose job, etc ‚Äî in the exact same way that he asked if I would ever get my mole removed.  I‚Äôm not morally opposed to plastic surgery, I just never really thought there was anything wrong with my boobs or my nose. 

So I feel like this was the tip of the iceberg. I feel like this was him pushing limits to see if he could convince me to change these other things. 
So I‚Äôm not feeling too great at the moment, and kind of feeling like I can‚Äôt tread water with all these gorgeous women. Bleghhhhh. "
That is exactly what I noticed. This is part of the problem and OP needs to acknowledge it. I feel for his wife. 
"He has no ""lack of understanding of relationship dynamics and appropriateness, because it's his first relationship"" because he is simply an asshole. Your new boyfriend should be your ex-boyfriend. "
I would nope the fuck out.
"&gt; He once picked my daughter (not his) up by her head (she's 10,. Weighs about 60 lbs) and she started crying in pain. He got upset that I got angry with him. 

I'm sorry, I couldn't even get all the way through your post. How in the world does he think it's accepetable to pick anyone up *by their head*, let alone a TEN YEAR OLD.

He sounds abusive, and I know Reddit throws it around a lot, but I don't say that lightly.

Everything in this post paints a larger picture. This marriage situation may be the straw that broke the camel's back, but it's ***NOT*** a stupid reason to end things. You two are incompatible and he's acting horribly.

Please, get you and your daughter out of this situation."
"Congratulations, you're an abuser.

Ghost him and get into therapy before you get worse."
"Op, listen to this. Reading just the headline I thought I was going to have the opposite reaction.  However,  as this is, you are going to have to choose between the trips and your boyfriend. Figure out which one means more to you."
"Doesn't sound like it's a good time or situation to get a dog right now. Can you ask the adoption centre if they allow volunteers to come help clean, feed or walk the dogs? If you really feeling like helping someone, find volunteer opportunities. But it sounds like you guys have a lot going on. Continue with couples counselling. Ask him what are some goals you can work on together. "
"Yeah, I say the same about my husband (we don't have kids) when he makes a corny joke or fawns over a cute kid.  I mean it as a compliment.  Some guys are way too immature to be dads."
"Shit, I will never forget that one. That was so meticulously planned out, over such a length of time.  Downright evil.

What is NOT fine is using your friend as an excuse. It‚Äôs not difficult: ‚ÄúFriend, I absolutely don‚Äôt want strippers at my bachelor‚Äôs party. If you get them, I will leave. This isn‚Äôt a joke. I will leave, and be terribly disappointed in you.‚Äù"
"""so I honestly can't understand why my fiancee can't just ignore this""

For the same reason why she can't understand why you don't stand up to your best man. 

She shouldn't have to ignore this.  She told you what makes her uncomfortable and what is a deal breaker. Dude that's what a deal breaker is... something they will NOT compromise on. You even said you don't want them. So why are you putting your best man before your future wife? 

You need to tell him you won't be attending if strippers come and then hold to that.  If he shows up with strippers you either leave or bar him access. I mean, you have two choices. Burn your future wife (who stated she'd dump you anyways) or burn your ""best man"" who ignores your boundaries and disrespects yours and your fiance's wishes. 

"
"It's not unreasonable to want the partner who works fewer hours to do more around the house. As to ""bills"" what are we talking - food, electric, rent, etc...? 

50/50 is fair if it's what you can comfortably afford. If she wants something you can't comfortably afford, then she has to make up the difference."
Yeah I had no idea until this moment that emergency compassion flights exist. 
"I don't want to leave, but I think I will have to if she goes through with it because the thought of two more rounds of 'babies/toddlers"" is **hell** to me. "
"That's true, and sad to hear :( We do have plans to get married and his parents already call me their family :( 
I don't know the bride and groom super well though so I do see where they're coming from."
"I think I‚Äôm just going to have to put my foot down and tell him no. Hopefully he mans up and tells her how it‚Äôs going to be. I think he‚Äôs just afraid that they won‚Äôt cancel their trip for our wedding, which would be extra messed up."
"When I was renting, I bought a locking doorknob for my room. I just kept the old knob and put it back when I moved out, it's very easy to do!"
"So...you're agreeing he approached this shallowly, and now he's wondering why they think he's shallow.

Because that's what he showed them."
"If there is any chance whatsoever that your girlfriend will see this bra, you should tell her upfront that you found a bra that your ex left behind and that you are doing to donate it."
What do you think would be different about sleeping with an attractive man compared to your boyfriend?
It might be helpful to try and dig into why this bothers you. What do you not like about him looking at animated porno? 
"You are correct. She's abusive. You yourself admit she essentially blackmailed you into not breaking up with her and boxed you into getting married.

Now she hits you during fights and turns any conversation you have about improving your marriage against you, saying that she's the only one who tries.

If you're ready, I think you should come clean to your parents about your scholarship. Tell them you're sorry for lying, but you're stuck in an abusive relationship and your spouse is using that lie against you. Why don't you feel ready to ask them for help? I think they'd be understanding about escaping an abusive marriage.

You sound like you have a stable job and income, you should tell her you don't want to be in this relationship anymore and then leave. Make sure she doesn't have access to your accounts."
"&gt;He is just one of those people that has a short fuse, and I have accepted there is nothing I can do to change that. 

Go google ""love is respect""  and visit that dot-org site.  

You can't change him, but you can change YOU and if you're willing to put up with it.  Do you want your daughter(s) to grow up thinking they're supposed to always walk on eggshells so their spouses don't get mad?  That's the example you're setting.  :(

"Please don't go to couples counselling with him. It's actually discouraged in abusive relationships, he's just gonna take everything you say in there and use it against you at home to abuse you further. You need individual therapy."
"I never liked this stance because you don't birth kids *for* someone. You do it for yourself, too.

""I birthed kids for you"" shouldn't be an argument as to why OP has the right to get birthday presents for her and buy things for herself. Her being a human being in an equal relationship and her husband loving her should be enough reason to get that."
"If he has money, he doesn't need your money. He needs your other attributes - companionship, kindness, friendship, partnership in life goals, etc. If he felt a personal need for a wealthy partner, he wouldn't have dated someone who isn't to begin with."
I agree. Counseling with a man like this makes the situation more dangerous. The second he thinks the counselor is belittling him or he feels his wife is being offered a way out the abuse is going to escalate instantly. She can't do this.
"Personally, I think pictures like that can be highly educational for those interested in farriery. When you own or handle horses for any length of time, unfortunately you see and get used to dealing with some graphic injuries. It's truly amazing how they can be so large and powerful, yet so fragile. And the vet bills! Eek. 
However, if he knew this was something you'd be this upset by, he shouldn't have shown you. You're on your path now, I would just like to wish you the best and I hope you can recover.

Edit: read original post, good for you getting shot of him. Take care of yourself. "
"You did 100% the right thing

If he does it again do the same.

However as someone who usually lives in a r/sub that has a high rate of ""S"" threats, the reaction comes off as someone trying to manipulate you by emotional blackmail. My ex stopped this the moment i called the police/ambulance on her. Not a word since and it was regular until then. (Mostly veiled threats, nothing too direct until she held a knife to her own throat, then ran off when i dialled 999)

There is a good chance it won't happen again now as you called their bluff. If it does

Do not deviate, it is not your responsibility to be the outlet for this persons problems, they need to seek medical help.

Early in our relationship my husband blew off my birthday. We had a friend crashing on our couch and he decided to watch a game of football with him all night (I HATE football) and forgot to make dinner. I sat him down the next day and told him while he might not care about birthdays I do. I told him that I didn't need a production but I did want to do something. He has never forgotten or blown off a birthday since. That's what someone who respects you does when they see their behavior is hurtful. 
"As long as you used the condom in the proper manner there‚Äôs a 99% chance that you‚Äôre not pregnant. It will all be fine, we have hope in you. "
"It sucks, but you have to respect her decision. If she feels lost right now then she's not really in a place for a relationship; She needs to focus on her right now.  I think it's wise to go no contact given how hard you are taking this, to allow yourself the space to move on."
Oh my god dude. Why are you helping this girl cheat? It doesn't matter what she says. She's not dumping her boyfriend. You need to move on.
If it's not affecting your relationship or your IRL sex life then it's not a big deal. You're already on the wrong side of the coin by totally breaching his trust like that. 
"Yeah I think some of the people in this thread forget anyone can have a melt down and react badly as well. I‚Äôve seen parents melt down taking care of just average bratty kids who decide to be stubborn and cranky. 

I can‚Äôt believe there are posters calling for the OP to kick his wife out of the house for a few weeks. There is a lot of change going on in the household in a short period of time it makes sense that there would be some tension and anxiety for everyone, not only Nicole."
"Oh man, I really hope I'm wrong, but you sound like an unreliable narrator. 

It just seems like you got caught and you're only posting on Reddit to appear genuine or to help your case by having Reddit behind you in case she comes across this post so she can be swayed. Clearly you care about Anna's feelings, so at least that's good. 

If I'm wrong, and you are indeed telling the truth, then I would ask Anna demand that Molly provide some proof. Maybe get Anna in touch with Molly's friends who were at the parties. Looking at time-stamped photos and all these digital records is actually meaningless because all of us know that they can be quite easily manipulated. The best thing to do at this point if you are telling the truth is to ask Molly to provide proof. "
"I suppose this is true too. My wife mentioned she would be bringing the kids to long island and she said she would drop them off here after a few days so I can see them. 

I don't think either of us are going to be arguing over custody like that. It seems clear its going to be split custody. "
He sounds like the quintessential nice guy we hear about here. If he doesn't get results playing the pity me card he will start calling you revolting names. Be ready for that.

Going to go out on a limb here and ask if there‚Äôs any chance you might be attracted to women. I was extremely uncomfortable with female nudity on TV or in movies for years and years before I realized I was bi/pansexual. 
"Look at your actions. You didn‚Äôt have to outright tell him to stop. His gf breaks out in tears if he looks at another nude woman. His choice is pretty much break up or stop. 
You have to realize there‚Äôs a problem first before anything can be done to fix this. Good luck. "

"A service dog is certainly something that disability services would help with, but Noelle is still in for a really rough adjustment. If she's going to school out of state, she's probably living in a dorm. That means she's got to go past a bunch of spaces that are busy to get to her dorm. Can she do that without melting down in the process? If her class is across campus, can she get back to the dorm or will she need to find somewhere closer by? How is she going to find a space that's guaranteed to be quiet, when universities are pretty constantly bustling with people? She had a meltdown in her own house, and in two years, OP is expecting her to learn a new campus? That's... a big ask. Transitioning to college is rough for even the most adaptable kids. They need to get really serious really quickly about Noelle's issues if they expect her to be prepared to do the whole living away from home to go to college thing in two years."
"I‚Äôm in college right now and have a learning disability (not autism but check my post history if you‚Äôre that curious), I know how stressful it can be. 

Let‚Äôs be real, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be ready for college in 2 years either but the OC I was replying to made me realize a service dog could be a viable option to get her out of situations before it becomes a full-blown, 5 hour meltdown on the floor because it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs unable to remove herself. 

I also think OP is vastly overestimating the scope of Disability Services on campus by the way, considering her high school is extremely accommodating and that‚Äôs just not how college works. "
"With all of these major red flags, there's also the fact that this poor child will be special needs and will need all kinds of extra attention and care that it doesn't sound like this couple will be able to provide.  This is horrible :("

"Your boyfriend is enabling his mother, and you are enabling your boyfriend to enable his mother.

One of you has to stop enabling someone. And your boyfriend is not going to stop enabling his mother just because you want him to, that is a lifetime of ingrained behavior that he is going to have to fight against, and it will probably take therapy.

You are going to have to be the one to stand up. You are going to have to be the one to put your foot down, set a strong boundary, as hard as it is, and tell your boyfriend you will no longer tolerate this behavior.

Yes it's going to suck. Yes, it's going to deeply upset your boyfriend. But you can't expect your boyfriend to deeply upset his mother, when you yourself are so afraid to deeply upset your boyfriend. You're asking him to do to his mother what you yourself don't want to do to your boyfriend. Do you understand? So if you can't do that to your boyfriend, then you can't ask him to do that to his mother. Someone is going to get upset, yes. First your boyfriend, because you're going to have to tell him something he doesn't want to hear. And then his mother, because your boyfriend is going to have to tell her things that she doesn't want to hear.

That's how boundaries work. We set boundaries, and some people don't like boundaries. Some people just want to do whatever they want, with no regard to others. And when you tell them that you would prefer that they stop, and have some regard for your feelings, they don't like that. They don't want that. 

Think of a vampire that needs to suck your blood, or it will die. Well, if the Vampire sucks your blood, you will die. You have to set a boundary, and tell the vampire that it can't suck your blood. The vampire will cry, and scream, and wail. ""I NEED your blood! If you don't give me your blood, I'll die and it will be all your fault! Why would you do this to me? Don't you care about anybody but yourself?"" Well, you still have to set the boundary. You still have to tell the vampire that it can't suck your blood, even if that means that it will die. Even if it means that it's going to be upset and hurt and devastated. You still have to set the boundary."

"Well, actually I think it‚Äôs Kevin‚Äôs responsibility to to establish boundaries with you in respect to his relationship. If his girlfriend is telling mutual friends that she doesn‚Äôt like you, I would be surprised if she isn‚Äôt saying the same thing to Kevin. And his response to that... is to keep hanging out with you anyway? This is an odd situation to me, and even if I thought he was a cool dude and we connected, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be this close to him. Why? Because he‚Äôs off limits (and IMO not great at setting boundaries). 

I‚Äôd rather save all of this energy and effort for someone who wants to be my partner. It might feel safe to crush on him because nothing can happen from it because he‚Äôs taken. But imagine if you had this connection with someone who was single... wouldn‚Äôt that be nice? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd be out there doing. "
"I would consider what he did to be cheating, whether you have proof of sex or not. He doesn‚Äôt respect you enough to tell you the truth, and wanted to have his cake and eat it too. A lot of people wouldn‚Äôt be able to ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with someone again after experiencing something like this, and I‚Äôm afraid there is no magic bullet back to happiness. I‚Äôve been in a situation similar to yours before, and I certainly couldn‚Äôt. I wasted a lot of time trying to regain feelings that weren‚Äôt there anymore and I will regret it forever. Lies erode relationships as do behaviors that can lead to emotional affairs. You‚Äôve got an important decision to make OP and I wish you luck. "

"Thank you, despite everything I'm really excited to meet my son :)

"Your anger is valid. The lies they told have messed up your grieving process and took away your righth to decide for yourself wheter or not you wanted to know the truth.

However, or valid feelings and the correct way to act are not one and the same. Because without it taking away from your valud feelings there are things you should consider in how you decide to act towards your friends.

They lied to spare people the traumatic details of her death. But more so they lied to everyone to spare them the traumatic details they had to experience. That comes across as them not just lying to be nobel, but as they themselves might be struggeling to deal with what they experienced. They found their friends body, they saw all the traumatic details, they had to give death notifications, and as their friends abusive parents got all of her friends out they became the only source of information about their friends death. That is a lot responsibilities and by making up a nicer version it made it easier for them. It‚Äôs easier to tell a comforting story than a traumatic one. It‚Äôs also so commonly done when talking about people passing that it might not even have occured to them that it‚Äôs different when trying to process a loved ones suicide.

That doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt talk to them about this, especially as it might be useful in your grieving process. But you might want to change how you frame it, so instead of ‚Äùconfronting them for their lies‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äùtalking to them about the lies to help me better process it‚Äù. Ask them why they did it. Be honest about how it effected you. Ask them how they are cooping with everything. Talk about how you are going to deal with everyone believibg their version of the suicide. The goal is for you to get the chance to express yourself, not to blame your friends."

Especially after the ""I asked if that is only because she is mad right now, she said yes.."" part of the conversation. She was basically admitting she was being pouty and petty and probably just needed to let off steam and that was the heads up *I'm about to say things I don't mean so just grin and bare it because you're fucking up and I'm mad* At least, that's how I picture it in my head. I don't actually think we know either of these folks well enough to make any real determination. I'm just high and like reading about other people's relationship problems."
Get a lawyer and divorce your husband. This whole situation sounds toxic as fuck and your daughter deserves a better and more stable environment to live in.

Honestly if I were you, I‚Äôd give her a taste of her own judgmental medicine: ‚ÄúYeah Mom, a man shouldn‚Äôt be learning anything if his weaker sex partner has to teach him- just like a parent shouldn‚Äôt be bumming off of their child.‚Äù

It puts the blame on the BF and that is what is not fair. He has a boundary, he is enforcing it and he is not a bad guy for having or enforcing that boundary.

"Luke probably wasn't ""just friends"" with OP or, later, any of her friends. He was probably waiting until they came of age to show his true colors.  

I was just talking to my boyfriend about a guy I used to be friends with who is a lot like Luke, except instead of hitting on my friends, it was all fixated on me. My Luke was my best friend for years (3ish I think) while I was in high school. There was a similar age gap between us, though I don't remember the exact number now.  

The moment I turned 18 he changed, and started getting obsessive and creepy, insisting that we were meant to be together, etc. He had waited for years, pretending to be my friend, and then once there were no legal ramifications, he came clean.  

It doesn't matter that Luke isn't trying to date OP, or that he never was. He's still being creepy, and he's still preying on girls that are younger than him. Hell, he talked about plans to *rape* one of them at a party. I think his current actions speak volumes about his intentions when OP was underage."

"I understand, and I would urge OP to remember that all emergency service/first responder careers are essentially thankless. 

If at all possible, I would encourage OP to support his fiancee in her career. There will be days when she second guesses her career path, when she feels she mishandled a situation, experienced something truly traumatic, or questions whether or not she makes a difference. She doesn't need her partner to make her feel worse.

OP's girlfriend is young, but has a fulfilling professional career that provides a livable income and benefits. She may or may not advance into a supervisory role. She may or may not choose to remain in her chosen profession forever. However, for now, she is providing a valuable service to her community. I would hope her fiance would be proud, and would choose not to equate money with the personal and professional worth of the woman he chose as his partner.

Are you 100% sure he has a second job and he‚Äôs not just using it as a cover to hookup wth her?"
"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs malicious, though. He didn‚Äôt want to have sex and she did, she listened to his boundaries, and they found something to do thag made them both comfortable. I would expect that behavior from a good guy or good girl."
"But if you don' tell her, she'll never fix the problem. Tough love is still love, and if you don't express to her the problems she has, you are not protecting her. On the contrary, you are setting her to failure.

Even worse, you're not even protecting her feelings in the end because she CONTINUES to feel excluded and keeps complaining. Lying doesn't protect her feelings because she continues to feel hurt and abandoned. The difference is that lying hurts her continually, while telling the truth may hurt her initially, but open a door for her to change.

Whether she's going to try to change or not, that's her business."

"&gt; All I know is that assaults like that are never a 'mistake'. He knew it was wrong when he did it.

Unfortunately I know some people who don't know this is wrong. At all. 

An incredibly awkward friend of mine was dancing with a girl in a club once and grabbed her face in order to kiss her, not realising or picking up she was not ok with this. We obviously ushered him away and the girl had her friends do the same. But he was genuinely dumbfounded when we told him what he did was wrong. Happy to say since then he hasn't repeated such behaviour and actually learnt from it."
My stepsister did that except it was with a pillow. We‚Äôre lucky the whole bed didn‚Äôt go up in flames. 
"That's probably going to depend on your city or even neighborhood in the city.

To be frank I had this happen with a rich girl and the police there really don't want anything happening on their watch.

"Ya you are pretty careless. Humans can only attend to one thing at a time and rely on attention switching to handle multiple things at once. I doubt even a professional driver would be careless enough to take their attention from the road for even a second or two. You are definitely in the wrong here, not only could you have injured yourself, but someone else.

You should apologize and never do something that dumb again."
"5 KIDS. What? And an ex-wife told him to give up custodial rights? Just because you have 2 kids at 22 means nothing in regards to this. You may choose to have 1 more or not. But this is where we are now.

"I think you both owe each other an apology. 

You tell her you're sorry and that it was an honest mistake and you'll work harder to make sure it doesn't happen again. You should also reiterate that her reaction was over the line and not only put herself in danger, but she put others in danger with hot food and possibly broken glass/dishware.

She tells you she's sorry for her reaction to being deadnamed (which really DOES suck) and that she'll work more on coping skills for this happening because it wasn't the first time and sadly it probably won't be the last time."
Agreed! She should be falling over herself to prove her honesty. 
"&gt;""well you've been bugging me all day, so honestly, no I don't""

Fiance has checked out, OP. If he actually cared about your dinner date with friends he would have been back with time to spare in between. I wouldn't forgive him for saying something so disrespectful. He KNEW he had a dinner date. I guarantee he got drunk (or is lying) so that he doesn't have to go so he can stay with his buddies. 


By how shady his actions are, I would be suspicious of cheating or him doing something he know you won't approve (think like rec and or hard drugs). 


I would certainly dump someone for such a lack of respect. Do you want to marry someone who pulls this shit? This is not a one and done, OP. This is the type of apathy that grows over time to the point where he'll do stuff just to make you upset or hurt you."

"He usually stays out with those buddies for a while, but he's also usually back by noon or 1 the next day, since he sleeps in after a night of drinking. I don't care as long as that was the plan and I know where he's at, in case of any emergencies. But being this late after being that rude, makes me upset. "
Her behavior is so monstrously unjust that it begs belief.  Has she always been this self-centered?  Is this behavior out of the ordinary?  Have you left out critical context?
"If you are close to your BIL I would recommend reaching out to him, or have your husband do it if he‚Äôs closer. Phrase it as you both are concerned for your sister because this blindsided you and is out of character for her. "
"How would you feel if your husbands friend sexually assaulted you and he kept bringing him around you and dismissed the gravity of what he did to you?

This was not a drunken mistake. Alcohol just suppressed her judgement and she gave in to what was always there to begin with (I‚Äôve always wanted you...)

If you don‚Äôt have enough self respect to kick her to the curb, at least have enough respect for your husband "
This is a great answer. 
Even people who smoke in their own home generally understand not to smoke in other people's homes. It is easy to tell if people allow smoking... look around to see if there are ashtrays or just ask before lighting up.
"I grew up very poor and non white

You have already betrayed her.  

You need to break up.  It's clear that she cannot give you what you want, and it's not fair to her for you to keep her as a comfort blanket while you emotionally and eventually physically cheat behind her back.  

You are not acting in good faith right now.  If you want to be honorable in your actions, you need to break up and figure yourself out."
"Well you have to have some empathy with her at this time. She miscarried the child you two were beginning to plan to bring into the world. 
I think you should have waited to discuss that with her but also since you changed your mind you also need her to understand. Give her some time"
"Please stand up for yourself OP. Your husband is being a jerk. You have every right to not do something, especially sexual, that you are not comfortable with. The fact that he is not respecting that is extremely concerning. Not to mention that this whole idea is idiotic.

No. Not to be blunt but you're seeing all the signs that he is genuinely in love with his gf, she's not just some girl he's hooking up with. You have to accept that and move on. "

What they SHOULD have done was have me hand over the phone and say, ""Go home,"" but they want to preserve everyone's relationship.

Encourage her to look into domestic violence resources in your area to get a safety plan for dumping him. If she's not great with computer stuff, be prepared to take a couple of hours to help her block him on all social media, direct all of his e-mails to a folder that she doesn't read but does keep in case you ever need restraining order evidence, and block his number on her cell phone (and landline, if she has one.)

Also, she might need to think about what to say at work, if he starts trying to contact her there or make trouble for her there."

"So, I'm kinda annoyed at your husband for 'forgetting' about his daughter's motion sickness.  Isn't that something a parent should remember?  He should be the #1 person handling Macey when she gets sick. He doesn't get to do any rides or anything if she's sick.  



I also get motion sickness and here's a few things that have worked for me:

- motion sickness wristbands

- therapy - Cellular Release Therapy (for traumas that someone may not remember), or hypnotherapy

- ENT for inner ear issues 


- not eating for 2-3 hours before getting into the car


Good luck"

"Whilst I do believe that men and women can have platonic relationships, getting upset over you saying you're with a romantic partner, or freaking out when you start putting a romantic partner first is a clear sign that this isn't platonic. The fact she would rather you lie to her and tell her you're busy, than you tell her you're with another girl screams jealousy and denial to me. 

It might be she's not interested in you romantically but liked the feeling of being number 1 for your attention and is now hurt that she's being pushed out by someone else. But she's being unreasonable either way, and also a drama queen - you go on a date and can't immediately respond to her snaps and suddenly you don't care about her and don't support her and she's doing it in a snap story instead of explaining to you why she feels that way? 0 to 100, drama drama, who needs that in their life. She's the one not supporting you. If she was a friend she would have given you a high five and said to have a good night."

The ""winner"" gets to pick a ""prize"" (date night ideas, massages, a hot selfie, etc). The more dares you complete, the more advanced/racy options become available.

Agree. Doing some chores everyday goes a long way. I was stranded once for two weeks when I was 18. A kid I just met said I could stay with him. I made dinner and cleaned the kitchen every day I was there. They were sorry to see me go. 
"How do you distinguish? A mess up is like accidentally dinging spouse's car or forgetting to empty the dishwasher or maybe being in a crabby mood and apologizing for it later. When it comes to physical injuries, a ""mess up"" is the time my husband accidentally elbowed me in the face while he was sleeping and then apologized profusely when I woke him up to tell him what happened and he felt terrible even though it was a total accident. 

Abuse is when your partner bullies you, accuses you of shit because you went out with your friends (attempting to control you) or intentionally injures you. Slapping, punching, shoving, pulling hair is abuse. Anytime someone purposely hurts you, that's abuse. 

It's not salvageable. He ripped your fucking hair out because he was mad. He was mad because you went out with a friend (which is not normal or healthy). This is a big deal. And abusers often accuse their partners of cheating because a) they themselves are cheaters or b) because it's a means of control, of alienating them from friends by keeping them home so that they're not talking to people who might realize abuse is going on and talk sense into them.

I've been married to my husband for 10 years. He's never accused me of cheating. He's never gotten mad at me for going out or staying out late. Actual text conversation - Me: ""FYI, I'm going out with (friend) on Sat night."" Him: ""Have fun!"" And he has never, ever put his hands on me in anger. We've had minor fights (never yelling or screaming or name calling) and he talks to me like an adult, with respect, even when he's mad. (And FYI, I've never done any of these things to him because it is NEVER OK). Good people do not physically attack their partners. Period, no excuses. 

You need to leave. Please don't accept his excuses or attempts to normalize/diminish what he's done. Abuse often starts subtly and escalates and by the time something ""big"" happens (this, for instance, is BIG), the abused person has attempted to cope by minimizing incidents to the point where it seems normal or OK or not that big a deal. And it's not dumb to feel that way, so don't feel like it's your fault for not seeing it ‚Äî the human mind will do whatever it needs to do to cope with something, this is something many, many people do. You tell yourself it could be worse, it's not THAT bad, he didn't hit me (until he DOES hit you, then it's, well, he didn't punch me/kick me/leave a mark, until THOSE things happen, and it goes on and on). 

You don't have to explain anything to your coworkers but you should find someone you trust that you can confide in and start making a plan to leave. Search this sub, there are a lot of posts with helpful info on how to leave an abuser. "

"You act as if laundry and playing with her children are the only things this woman has to deal with during the day. It takes a LOT of work to keep a house clean.

Agreement from me. I don't think she should cut everyone off, but her approach is definitely not working here. Her husband has seemingly been quiet and good-natured, but now he's the problem because he's kinda causing waves...with stuff she agrees with him on, but hasn't said aloud to her family."

"Exactly. OP's girlfriend is plotting out his life for him and trying to change him to be someone she can respect.

You want a get a dog that‚Äôs going to be home alone with her and under her care 40 hours a week. She wants to make sure you aren‚Äôt just using her as a live-in dogsitter.

"Yeah, there are some things that trump everything and that's your child's life. OP, you need to prioritize him and if it means leaving you have to do it.

You are rationalizing.
"I guess. A lot of things people say are petty don‚Äôt always seem that way to me. Like this doesn‚Äôt seem petty to me at all. 

For example, my mom is horrifyingly awful and told me I‚Äôd be a terrible mother.

She has zero contact with my niece because of similar issues with my brother. I think she actually hasn‚Äôt even met her and she just turned one. 

Edit: and I think it‚Äôs a bit unfair to think that only children are allowed to have emotional reactions. Adults have emotions too and sometimes a reaction will be fueled by those emotions. It doesn‚Äôt make it petty necessarily. "
"Negative motivation (Or what do you call it?) can be very stressful for a child. Also, why does your wife think that she and the daughter is the same? Your wife was motivated by people not believing in her, but that doesn't mean it's like that for your daughter. Or for most people.

I think it is abusive to tell children they can't learn basic skills. Your wife perhaps have some issues from her upbringing? And your daughter will see through it when she's older. "

It will be very hard for her to do that, and if you have children, it‚Äôll be very hard to maintain that.  And then your children will ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the antisemitic grandparents.

If she truly thinks her back is against the wall and she has no choice, you can offer, ""Do you need me to be the bad-guy here? What support do you need in order to keep him out out our apartment?"""
Just ask where the rest went. Maybe they do love her the most. Maybe there is some other reason that has nothing to do with favoritism. 
"You're asking for advice on how to make a man who is quickly approaching 30 to be more financially responsible so you and his daddy don't have to continue to bail him out because he doesn't understand the concept of money.

My sincerest advice, following your request to not advise breaking up, is to never share accounts, loans, or titles with him, and accept that this is who he is.

Edit: peeked at your post history. I think you should talk to a professional. You are self-medicating to cope with your depression and act as if it's your responsibility to fix your boyfriend's immature habits. I know that change is scary but you can do much better for yourself. "
Exactly. If you don‚Äôt take that initiative then it‚Äôs going to feel even worse. At least make the decision yourself.
"I'm not saying you're awful just for lying. 


I'm saying you have deep issues and very concerning mental health problems that you would consider getting back together with this guy **at all**. 

The lying is just the icing on the cake of the horrible, tragic betrayal that is you getting back into a relationship with this guy in the first place."
"Your boyfriend should be kinder to you and more concerned about your feelings. He doesn't have to think you're the most beautiful woman to have ever lived, but he ought to treat you like you're the most beautiful to him.  

&gt; but to me it isn't obvious unless he shows it every day. 

But this is a bit much. You need your boyfriend to compliment your looks every day? It strikes me as a bit needy and insecure. Do you compliment him every day? I know my boyfriend thinks I'm gorgeous (more fool he), but not because he tells me every single day. 

He should be willing to express love in the way you want/need to hear it, including by not vocally moaning when another woman appears. But make sure you're doing some self-validation, too. Shoring up your basic self-esteem isn't his job, it's yours. "
"Do you feel guilty? Or do you just feel regret?

It's fine and reasonable to *regret* inviting an entitled, manipulative, self-aborted addict into your home, but guilt would be misplaced. Don't let this ass get into your head. You didn't mislead him. He used you. He likely intended to be a user from the get-go. You were the one misled: You thought he wasn't a useless ass.

When you removed him, he found a mean-name to call you to try and blame you for his own shittiness. ""Led me on"" was the best he could think of. It's really just kind of sad. 

Block him and be glad to leave him behind you."
"Sometimes you harbor resentment towards even your closest friends. It‚Äôs a product of being a good friend, I think... you have to put disagreements aside. Your friend is supportive of you and positive with you, and simply chose the wrong way to vent some things she wouldn‚Äôt say to your face. I mean, haven‚Äôt we all been really mad at a friend and chosen to let it go instead of confronting them? 

Idk. She was dumb to write this online instead of a journal. But think about whether there‚Äôs any chance her positive face towards you is the real her, and this journal isn‚Äôt."
"Honestly, your edit to the post only shows you fully refuse to see the truth of the situation. It doesn't matter what labels you throw on what you are participating in, and it's probably not going to end well. "
Your boyfriend sounds like a bit of a leech tbh. 
"So true! I had a relationship with a guy who didn't want me to dye my hair red or paint my nails because he ""likes it natural"". Like dude, I had blond wisps through the whole relationship which made my hair WAY more blond and he loved it!

Some guys are just so fake about this, it's frustrating.

End of story: I broke up with him and dyed my hair red like instantly. I have red hair for several years now and I love it!

Never let anyone try to make you feel bad about the way you look or want to look. "
Your boyfriend sounds like a good lad
"I understand your frustrations, but I don't understand how the color of his skin plays any part in this. "
"Your boyfriend isn't an aspie, hes an asshole."
"I would put money aside, instead of buying physical things. The baby doesn't need anything atm, so he'll either have a nest egg to buy stuff with, or a nest egg to blow on a trip to Vegas, or any amazing trip he'd like to take to get his mind off her."
"&gt; Seems selfish.

IS selfish. Stop letting him reap the rewards of his behavior and let him start feeling the consequences, which are that if you use people without apology you get dumped on your greedy ass. "
"OP, you can never lose her trust or gain it back. She will never trust you and everything you wrote here objectively says it all for you. She can say she trusts you and ""here take my phone"" all she wants. her actions don't match up.

Seeing as you have never done anything to make her act this way, it will not get better. You need to leave her because of this or you will just be dealing with this until it gets worse."
"Incredibly controlling. Major, major red flag. "
"&gt;  out of immaturity

Even so, the only lesson he's going to learn if you take him back is ""I can cheat on her and she'll take me back."" There's no repercussions or consequences for his actions, aside from a few crocodile tears and being in the doghouse for a month. Big whoop. 
"
"There is NEVER a good reason to not tell a loved one you're going out.  Even if it's just so one person knows where you were supposed to be if you end up dead in a ditch.  A quick one line text, ""Hey babe!  Going to the bar with my boys tonight!"" is literally all you need to do.

Why is it so hard for you to do that?  It's a tiny little request she's making."
"I'm a firefighter and you're right those levels are too high for him to stay. Call the fire department and have them check the house.

Another option is to get the old lady to have the gas company come do a free check. When they come out and find levels that high, they will immediately red tag the meter and shut off gas to the building. That forces the homeowner to get someone certified out to do the needed repairs "
"OP also said they've had ""many"" calls from the school about her melting down due to boundry issues with other children. They've only been living in their current neighborhood since winter break. That's what, a month of school since? Any way you slice it, her meltdowns sound very, very frequent. "
I wouldn't bother with an ultimatum. He knows how you feel. He just doesn't care enough to put any effort into making you happy. Cut your losses and move on. 
Sometimes 20 years feels too recent :(
"I don't think it's fair to say that people never get better about things. When I first started dating my husband he was really into one specific sport and watched every game he could for every team.  We had a talk about not planning our lives around games, and we worked out compromises.  We had a talk about sulking after a loss (nothing near as extreme as what OP describes) and he's grown out of that.  Now he watches mostly on his computer while he works.  And as more important things popped up in our lives (like children) he naturally let sports fall to the ""it's nice to catch a game occasionally"" level.  

I don't think it was unreasonable for OP to assume that as her husband matured his fanaticism for sports would calm down.  "
"This seems about right. Push for a straight answer, and if you can't get one then be with the person you *know* is reaching out. Ultimately, if someone needs support, they need to ask or at least accept when it's offered. "
"Sure, but your partner doesn't stop existing and stop having needs. That is the sure-fire track to a shitty relationship and possible divorce. Especially with a special needs kid."
"He does understand that it hurts you. THAT‚ÄôS WHY HE DOES IT. Your misery isn‚Äôt a bug, it‚Äôs a feature. "
"Maybe, maybe not. OP describes her as wandering in, which doesn't imply a sense of urgency or purpose. Its possible she just made a silly mistake without thinking, but if she is living in her own in a college environment these silly mistakes will have pretty major social consequences. If a student curls into a ball in the middle of a cafeteria floor, I guarantee she will be touched by some well meaning person to see if she's ok, which will cause the screaming and the whole hours-long breakdown in a public place. If she wants to be able to survive in college, she can't be making silly mistakes like thinking a busy sensory-overloaded kitchen will be a good place to calm herself down. "
Congratulations! Newsflash. Not everyone is you. 
"STOP DOING THINGS FOR HIM.

Do nothing for valentines. Stop bringing him treats.

STOP IT.

When he brings it up, have him reflect on his feelings. Ask him how it must feel for you, who has NEVER had this from him. He doesn‚Äôt want to put in the emotional labor to do things for you. You can plan a fun date in 15 min while pooping on your phone. This stuff IS NOT HARD."
It was important to say.  She should be with someone who respects her and appreciates her good-heartedness.
"These kind of super-sensitive ""I feel"" statements only work if the other person is operating in good faith. For example, ""I feel overwhelmed with household responsibilities when you volunteer to work late and don't come home until the kids are in bed."" That works if you're married to someone who thought he was doing the best thing for his family and didn't know it was causing you to approach a nervous breakdown. If the person with the problematic behavior knows that he's being as ass (hint: your husband does) then the ""I feel"" statements just fall on flat ears and make you look whiny. If you want him to get his shit together before just leaving him, you're probably going to have to be willing to hurt his feelings and criticize him a little more directly. This isn't a misunderstanding; it's just him getting away with bullshit. "
A bike is more likely to break your hymen than a tampon and that is saying a lot!
"Agreed on all points.

Also, I think OP's current ""dad to the rescue"" fallback approach is at direct odds with his claims that she's independent.

Noelle may be fine on her own when things are easy, but it sounds like she frequently ends up in situations where OP needs to come to the rescue (being phoned by the school, sitting down with her *for hours* in the middle of a bustling kitchen, taking the day off of work when Noelle feels sick).

It seems extremely optimistic to insist that in just two years, she'll improve to the point where she can be alone in an out-of-state college, where OP won't be around during the rough times."
It sounds like you need to cut your brother out to. He is purposely feeding information to your abusers. That doesn't make him a good brother or someone that you should rely on or have a relationship with.
"And how do you plan on solving her problem? 

Women get sexually harassed regardless of how they dress. You are naive (and to be reductionist: you are downright sexist) if you think it's her fault because of how she currently dresses. She cannot change her immediate work environment outside of quitting her job. Your impulse to tell her to change how she dresses is nothing more than blaming her for the sexist environment she works in - not solving the real problem at all."
Well I think based on his behavior we can rule out the reason being because he respects and love her. 
"Shoving and grabbing and pushing are all dealbreakers. All of those things are really bad for your personal sense of safety -- they force you to live in a state of low-level fear, which drains your mental resources and resilience -- and they are also likely to escalate to more ""serious"" (i.e. putting you in the hospital) kinds of violence.

It's *extremely* worrying that his reaction to this is to shove it off.

There are couples who have this dynamic who are still together -- my parents, for one. But they aren't happy."
That doesn't make it right.  
"There's nothing wrong with explaining to your child that you didn't feel his/her father was a suitable partner to build a family with. 

There IS something wrong with having to explain that you never bothered to tell his/her father about his/her existence. Do you really want to explain to a child that his/her father might have wanted to be involved but wasn't given the choice? 

You aren't obligated to marry this dude or even like him. But you don't get to unilaterally decide to erase him from his own child's life. I totally respect your decision to keep the baby, but that makes it also his baby. He will probably be happy to sign off all his rights...but he doesn't have to and that is his choice. Having this baby means accepting that. "
Seriously! This was one of the first couple topics of discussion when my husband and I first started talking. Compatibility isn't just about sex.
"Ignoring it won't be sufficient to end it. Stop giving him the debate he wants, label the behaviour as inappropriate and aggressive, tell him his texts are unwelcome and block him if he doesn't spot. Speak to your husband about the harassing texts and your concerns about bringing a young girl into the group with this dynamic. Ignore it in the short term just to give you and your husband time to settle on a response. "
"Whoah--dude had an allowance that is almost what I make at my full time job and he managed to get $30k in credit card debt? And they are DINK?? Yeah, it's going to be about the money pretty soon if that is how he manages his finances. Yikes!"
I mean honestly you weren‚Äôt going to go anywhere in the first place.  Second they told you the one girl is the only one looking for someone to date therefore your only option is to say you are interested or not.  Lastly it is odd to even make the comments you did because it‚Äôs unrelated.
"Also why can't you get the dog yourself if this is a good dog for you? Did I miss the explanation? So what if you break up? It's your dog, not his."
"Everyone's hating on the guy but it sounds like he's on the right track to reach the sky, he could even be the next president."
"I don‚Äôt want to sound mean here, because you‚Äôre clearly the victim in this. But aside from her being unreasonable for asking you back. Your stipulations are unreasonable. I know how hard it is to think when you‚Äôre emotional, but imagine what a relationship would be like when you‚Äôre basically commanding the other person. "
"Thank you for responding! This is insightful and I can see how my own biases might have shown after the situation was ""resolved""."
She doesn't have money for therapy. He won't let her. 
"If you gave him permission to go to your residence and pick some stuff up and he had a key, it's likely this won't amount to anything at all. So relax, he won't go to jail... he didn't even get inside. Look at this calmly and analytically. People don't go to jail for standing on someone's porch. So unless he spray painted ""OP's boyfriend was here,"" on the side of their house I don't think there's a problem."
"Except that it won't do anything to address his financial abuse, emotional abuse, or emotional manipulation."
"&gt;She said she was worried that I will want kids and should be focusing my energy on being with someone younger that I could actually achieve that with. 

To have or not have children is a huge deal breaker for a lot of couples.  Have you explicitly told her whether or not you want children?  Because it sounds like she is looking for a long term partner and doesn't want to be with someone who is going to dump her in three years because she doesn't want/ can't have children.  "
"Woof your woe as me shit in the comments is exhausting. 

We get it. She said she would have an abortion. WE GET IT. But she's not doing that now, is she? 

SO, like other folks have said - sit her down, and tell her that you are literally in a spot where you want to leave if she has these children. You said you didn't want them, you made an agreement and you still don't want them and that it is your literal living hell. 

THAT BEING SAID - you cannot force her to have an abortion. You just can't. These are the facts. 

So you can a) leave her while she's pregnant with twins and pay child support out the ass for the rest of your life while most likely having no access to the daughter you love 

Or 

b) you can stay, make the best of whatever it is this life you did not want gives you and be there for two kids who did not ask to be born and most likely resent your wife for the rest of your life because that's exactly how you sound right now. 

You say you don't know what to do - the only thing you can do is get off the computer and talk to your wife, a RATIONAL CONVERSATION. May not be a bad idea to bring up finances. That is it. That is your option. I'm sorry this is happening, I'm sorry she is pregnant and I'm sorry life is shitstorm of things you don't want - but that's what it is. "
"Most definitely. I always wanted to travel more before I became so weighed down about money, so maybe that will be rekindled."
"Have you ever had a wedding? There‚Äôs vendors and a whole bunch of stuff that already have been paid for and scheduled for that specific date. So I do have quite a bit invested in that date. They aren‚Äôt trying to make it work, they‚Äôre asking us to work around their vacation."
It's so dehumanizing. 
"But the stuff he is making up is deeply misogynistic, that says something about him and who he is and what he believes, regardless of whether the the stories he is telling are true or not. There's really no interpretation of this that doesn't end with him having serious problems with women. Surely you can understand why that would make women in his life uncomfortable? "
"One idea is to break apart your mortgage payment using the same way one should use when comparing the costs of buying versus costs of renting.

Here‚Äôs how it works. Let‚Äôs say your mortgage is $2000 a month, but $700 is going to principal and $1300 to interest. Well, in reality, you 
are paying that $700 portion to yourself, since it reduces your debt 
and raises your equity. So since she isn‚Äôt receiving any of that equity, perhaps she should pay 50% of the $1300 and not 50% of the whole payment.

You still have the issue of rewarding her for her efforts with upkeep or repairs or furnishings, etc. but at least the monthly ‚Äúrent‚Äù portion could be handled this way. 

"
"I'm pretty sure maspeor's point is that the mature thing to do is to tell the bride OP is dropping out of the wedding and will not be a bridesmaid, as a result of the bride's lie she forgot, thereby not letting OP get walked on.

Rather than going out of her way to do something petty/mess with the bride's wedding. The bride is shady, OP doesn't have to be the same to set a mature, adult boundary."
This is such a great way to look at this

"&gt;I know this is pretty dramatic but I'm starting to feel like he's Boyfriend #2 and she's splitting her attention between us.

Nah dude you are boyfriend #2. I mean I get not wanting to be controlling but she is disregarding you for him. She knows damn well that he has a crush on her and she enjoys the attention. Time to make a decision....are you ok with being runner up in your relationship or do you want someone who is going to respect you and your feelings. This may have been solved long ago by you communicating your feelings on the issue. If you have already done this though and yet we still find ourselves in the situation then at least you know what kind of person she is. Basically you aren't wrong or controlling, most people would have bailed on the situation including me.   "
"Hey girl , it really sounds like you have some major body issues so I would definitely recommend seeing professional help.

As for everything else, your bf should like you no matter what size you are, barring you gaining or losing like 100lbs, which is super drastic.

If you felt better and healthier the way you used to look, then tough bananas for him. It sounds like he was genuinely worried about your health by asking you about your caloric intake, but His comments about your body are inappropriate and he should be supporting you and not saying he ‚Äúliked you before‚Äù "
Ugh that‚Äôs good you sorted it out. I‚Äôve lost it before and still have it eating at the back of my head. Because I still don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôd have it in his pocket

"Well the truth of it is now that if you want to really reconcile with her, you'll have to move out of your comfort zone and move. I mean they are your kids, you had unprotected sex yes?

If you don't want to do the hard work and would prefer to just mail a check every two weeks and see your kids once a month via FaceTime, stay at your current job.

But she can't unhear those words, so now you're gonna have to prove you're in this with her for real. 

Move. Or don't. But you won't have this option long."
Just one of your points is reason enough to end it PLEASE end it ASAP . He‚Äôs told you he‚Äôs not interested in you anymore you need to get out like yesterday. 
"I think he feels a little emasculated, OP mentions lack of respect from guys at work because he he is in construction but not manual, I think he want's a blue collar fantasy where he works like a dog and his wife is lazy 'cos that's what he hears from the manual laborers that he wants ""respect"" from."
"He has created a fake wife though, that's the main point- if it was just him making up that he does manual labor and complaining about that it wouldn't be so bad, it's that he's making up this awful lazy wife! Why would he need to do that ?!"

Probably a symptom of you saying negative things about her.  If you keep putting her down, why would she even believe you when you say nice things?"
Exactly. I feel bad for the kid in OP's situation. Seems like she won't be given an opportunity to develop healthy male relationships if mom doesn't allow men to hug her kid.

"Title IX enforcement had nothing to do with the Duke Lacrosse case. That occurred in 2006 and went so spectacularly wrong in large part because an unethical district attorney was more interested in making a name for himself than seeking justice.

It wasn't until 2011 that the Obama Administration's Education Department issued the famous Title IX letter to colleges and universities requiring them to treat sexual violence as a violation of the victim's civil rights, and to act accordingly or face the loss of federal funding. "

It sounds stupid because you're acting all martyr like. Come on.  If you only feel special one day a year then that's your problem. Like yourself more. Be yourself every day of the year. Celebrate yourself.

"From her perspective, you blocking her number and you just never responding to her messages is the same, no? Its not as if she gets an automated reply saying ""you've been blocked for being a dreadful friend"" or anything. Given all of this, I would go ahead and block her so that you aren't seeing her messages and experiencing her overtures and umbrage even if you don't intend to respond to it. Make it easier on yourself to disengage."
"100% this.  Nothing should separate (read: more than an hour drive or so) you from your SO when they're pregnant.  You always need to be ready in case something happens.  If the baby is due June 30 you need to be running point in your own family, which to me would mean no drinking or other impairing substances, always being ready for the trip to the hospital to give birth.  It's just the reality of now being responsible for a new life, as well as possibly your SO's life if there are complications. "

"Your boyfriend is the jerk here. He yells at you, he‚Äôs intentionally cold to your friend, he‚Äôs isolating you from your support network, and he has sexist attitudes about women and sex. Red flags for abuse all other the place whereas your friend just cared about you and wanted to see you treated well. You owe your friend an apology and your boyfriend a break up. "
"I'm exactly the same. Normally it does me favors- I make loyal friends who are the same kind of giving person, and I feel like I can trust them to have my back and vice versa. This is not a bad trait to have, at its core. That being said, you need to take some time to vet people before treating them like that, and it's important to recognize if someone is taking advantage of you. I got into a horribly abusive relationship a few years ago, and despite having a wonderful partner now who would do anything for me, it still messes with my head constantly. Don't let yourself get hurt like that."

"I genuinely have no such desire. I want kids, but I couldn't care less about who they want. Someone not liking that their kid is gay would honestly be a problem for me. "
I think acknowledging that is an aspect of your personality is a big step in moving forward. Maybe learn to appreciate things in a new way or try to have your partner explain their POV and what they view as successes and what causes them to feel a sense of validation. Not everyone is the same and its not wrong for you to want external recognition. 
"Yeah, this thread runs the risk of degenerating into ""boyfriend is a monster, therefore by implication you're faultless"". Nope, he was way over the line and that shouldn't be tolerated, BUT ""I just held the phone, never touched his hand or body or used any force on him"" doesn't make taking his property and then laughing about it OK either. Nothing like ""you asked for it"" or ""they're equally bad"", but OP acted shittily AND her boyfriend overreacted and got physical. She should leave, but also rethink how she treats partners."
"I‚Äôm not at all religious but I remember your past comments around here on religion because just like this one I think they are kind, gentle, open-minded and not at all judgmental.

She‚Äôs an adult and your wife, not your daughter, *and* she has a spotless driving record. She knows that just because her car *can* go at absurdly fast speeds doesn‚Äôt mean she should drive that way all the time, everywhere. As a woman who also loves driving and sporty cars that are fun to drive I would not want a partner telling me I couldn‚Äôt drive the car I want because of some hypothetical future behavior that I‚Äôve never demonstrated in the past. "
"Well if you weren't giving him his phone back, how else was he supposed to get it except by force? He used his words and told you to give it back, and you responded by tickling him. You wanting him off his phone isn't reason for you to withhold his property from him. If you don't want him on his phone, you ask him to stop. If he doesn't, you deal with it or dump him. Taking his things isn't a solution.  

So, you physically snatch his property out of his hands and try to keep it from him, even when he asks for it back, you non-consensually touch him so he physically brushes you off. It sounds like you have a serious problem with physical and property boundaries. And maybe he has a problem, or maybe he's just physically defending himself against your unwanted touches, and physically trying to get his property back that you are actively withholding and hiding from him. It sounds like the only times he gets physical is to defend himself against your or because you won't give him his OWN property. Maybe? "
"He's given more details since last night,  and un(?)fortunately this is what it sounds like
 He admitted that it could have progressed to physical on his end but that she was never available to see him. How gullible can you get?! (I know,  pot, kettle). Thanks for commenting"

"When you're in really shitty or abusive relationship, you tend to second guess everything. 

Also, shitty/abusive relationships can start with very charismatic, friendly men. 

I went through the same thing as your gf. Got out of a shitty string of abuse, then met a dream man two days later and couldn't believe it. I thought I must be rebounding so I kept being non-exclusive until I could tell for sure if this was what I wanted, or if I was just tricking myself into thinking this is what I wanted. 

You've made it 8 months. Try and move past it. You can't get into her head and know 100% what she was thinking in the beginning nor is it worth it. She's here now and she's been honest with you. Don't let your insecurities lead you to unhealthy assumptions.

"The mother/father has zero business entering her ex's house to check how the kid is living. Any judge with half a brain will tell you that, this is absolutely a no go. If she suspects something bad is going on, then she can call CPS."
"At least in Ohio back when I tried to get wic , it was far better for me to get benefits single than if I married. 

It might be worth checking into before any quick decisions are made. 

If quicker housing / more benefits are available for her without an income and an infant it might be best to go with that for now.

He absolutely did this on purpose! 
"Walk away. He body slammed his girlfriend and his friends are all ‚Äúbut his temper‚Äù ‚Äúbut she asked for it‚Äù.

No. Him screaming in your face is enough by itself. This sounds like he abuses F and the others know about it and are choosing to do nothing.

She got CAUGHT three times. She cheated way more often. Focus on being the best you. She needs to look inward.
"This may be a jump, but due to all the red-flags (age gap, not wanting to use alternate forms of BC, being happy about your 19 year old gf being pregnant, encouraging her to not go to school and have a way to support herself) I‚Äôm wondering if he intended to get her pregnant to trap her. 

Is he controlling in any other ways, OP?"
"Your friends have your best interest at heart. 

I know it doesn‚Äôt seem it right now, but 3 years is a huge age gap for your age, trust me I have been there too. Usually older high school guys date the younger girls because they‚Äôve never dated anyone before. 

And it‚Äôs not that your stupid,  or naive necessarily, it‚Äôs just that you might have no expectation of what a healthy relationship can be. 

When I was 15 I dated a 17 year old guy from a different school who would be super nice and then just try to sleep with me whenever we were alone. I stood my ground on it and he left, good riddance.

I‚Äôm not saying not to talk to him, but I would definitely communicate how you‚Äôre feeling, that‚Äôs the best way to know, so he knows how you feel and he can tell you how he feels. Just  be careful! And stay safe ! "
"27 and 17 is *not* a good combo at all. I know you're an adult now, but christ; you were in high school while this dude was reaching 30. 

What 27 year old in their right mind would target a 17 year old high schooler?"
"Geeze, I'm pissed at him too!"
"You seem to dig in your heels about money when your daughter makes financial choices that you disagree with. You don't want to pay for her wedding because YOU wouldn't spend frivolously on a wedding - it feels like a waste of money to you. You felt a public education was sufficient, but she chose a private school. What's good enough in your mind should be good enough for her.

I'd encourage you to realize that your daughter is probably very different than you. What makes her happy? Do you know? If you consider using your money in ways that may make your family happier, then it is money well spent.

I also sympathize with your feeling that it's time to spend money on yourself. You sound like someone who has made lots of sacrifices, and perhaps you feel your wife and daughters haven't appreciated you. I can totally understand that and encourage you to pamper yourself more. (Honestly, a spa day or your favorite hobby won't be that expensive.) But perhaps your daughter's wedding is not the hill to die on. Your daughter will remember her wedding for the rest of her life. If you can surprise her with a generous gesture, it may come back to you in positive ways that cannot be measured. Good luck!"
"&gt; can handle the texture


I understand so much more about the Aspie experience just from that. And, all it tells me is that there's a strange and beautiful world where someone has to think about the overload sensory experience of *texture*. It must be beautiful sometimes, the world as you feel it. "
"Thank you for the validation. Eech, sorry you had to let a toxic friend go. I do feel badly, but there is no obligation to keep someone around who doesn't have good will toward me. I also think she wants to **hash it out** with me, and by that, I mean she would probably tell me all the ways I've supposedly victimized her.
&gt;
&gt;And then I blocked her number, because **the decision to stay in a relationship takes both parties' consent, but the decision to end a relationship can always be unilateral.**

Yep. Thank you for that. Not sure I'll block her number (because that would only give her more reason to stew against me) but I won't respond to her any more.

Did you guys have a conversation about exclusivity before she slept with this person? 
A piece of advice I learned the hard way. Op should take this to heart when figuring things out. 
"I'm even more pro choice now I'm a mother than I was before. I love my critter. But it's a relief I love and want and was ready for him - because he is so, so so much more work than I thought.
Please don't have a baby you dont want. That's reason enough."
"Sounds like he's panicking and doesn't realise it. So he's trying to find a reason for these feelings he has and every little problem he can find seems to explain it to him. For a while, until you make him see he's being silly. So he goes on and finds a new problem. He's bottling some shit up.

Talking on the phone about this is horrible. Visit him or talk to him when you get home. Sit him down, create a relaxing environment and try to talk. He will definitely get defensive first, I promise you. But you try to stay calm and just listen and ask him questions about the things he says. He will probably relax and start to seem like your partner again.


Also, do not dismiss the whole momma's boy situation. Even if she is more reactive than intrusive, he is still used to go to her for help and opinion probably. Make sure that this will not make your life complicated."
"Well, you're right - it could grow up completely unwanted and resented.

Far better to wait until she's ready."
Oh god that fucking guy. I remember that. Jaw-dropping. 
"&gt; It is like she doesn't trust my judgment

Does she frequently ask you to not be friends with people? Because right now, it sounds like you _are_ showing bad judgement."
That's not immature at all. Some people deal with exes by cutting all contact. That's a fairly common thing.
"I want to know how you can read every single one of OP's very well-thought-out, measured, and logical responses, and think she's not thinking clearly. "
"this has nothing to do with your husband ""paranoia"" , nobody smokes in my house without my permission, he is right to be mad.

Also disabling the smoke detectors is just silly , your dad has a problem with smoking clearly.

plus, leaving candles unattended is just retarted."

So here‚Äôs the deal. He didn‚Äôt apologize to make you feel better. He apologized to make HIMSELF feel better. If it was about you it would have been instantaneous and then he would have left you alone. He‚Äôs trying to absolve himself of guilt. Fuck that. I‚Äôd send the wine back and go back to forgetting about this asshole. 
"Idk...I flipped out over a bunch of stupid shit and cried at the drop of a hat when I was 14. Me and my mom argued about so many dumb things, and I was *so* sensitive to social slights from relatives and peers. 14 is mid-puberty. Hormonal emotions are wild at that age, and coping with the social dynamics of going from being a child to becoming an adult is stressful even under the best of circumstances, let alone when you're queer and worried about whether people will accept you. My LGBT friends who came out around then usually had explosive family drama as a result.  I mean, it's totally not okay to act out with physical violence, but I do think it's important to keep in mind that OP's nephew is going through puberty *and* transition *and* coming out. The kid's behavior isn't acceptable, but it's definitely understandable."
"Exactly my sentiment. Stop looking at your job as a home environment. You might have good friends there but the job itself doesn't give a damn about you, just your ability to efficiently deliver what it needs, and it will try to pump that out of you for the lowest price possible. 

So fuck em, right? It's a business so ignore any attempt they make to be your friend and haggle the shit out of them. Fuck them over. Make them fucking regret the amazing seemingly impossible deal you've been given on salary and vacation time. 

You are not the friend of the business you work with. Do not imagine it any other way. Maintain zero loyalty to your employment and be ready to ditch that place at the drop of a hat. It'll do the same to you."
"&gt; How am I supposed to know that you talk about me to your friends when you never tell me.

This is super messed up."
"Here‚Äôs the thing: your dad seems so nonchalant about it, how do you know he doesn‚Äôt already know? How do you know he‚Äôs not okay with it, and knows that his sex life and your moms sex life are none of your business?
Maybe they‚Äôre swingers. Maybe your dad can‚Äôt give your mom what she wants so he‚Äôs okay with someone he trusts giving that to her...
Bottom line, OP, it‚Äôs not your business. It sucks.
I found out at 16 that my dad had cheated on my mom, but that was after they had separated and then gotten back together. I found out after the fact. It was horrible and it fucked with my head for a long, long time. Trusting men after that has been nigh impossible.
But. It‚Äôs not your relationship. You have no say. It sucks, but it is what it is.
Remember, the only people that know for sure what is going on are those directly involved. And that‚Äôs not you. "
Bingo. 
"Being homophobic or sexist is wrong and shitty, culture is not an excuse. "
"I think that was just what she wanted to say to her ex, but couldn't"
"&gt; I bet there's a ton of other disgusting or dangerous family habits that OP has normalized.

Oh god, I never thought, but I bet you are right"
He was in a tough situation and made the right choice. thats not always easy to do. There's nothing wrong with praising someone for doing the right thing. 
"&gt; I never once asked her about her sexual past and that it didnt matter to me

That's a good start.

&gt;  its hard for me to say I want to build a future with somebody who openly told me she let men use her body because she wanted to feel used.

So does her sexual past matter or not?  And do you believe it's possible for someone to learn from their mistakes and change who they are as a result?

Because from your post she seems to clearly feel that that behavior was a mistake and is not representative of who she is either.
"
He was the host. It's not fair to expect a guest to take on the responsibility of putting an incredibly drunk woman to bed in someone else's home.
This sounds like a cop out. Like an excuse. Like a giant lie. I suspect your girlfriend agrees.
"You do not owe him your friendship. And if he demands it from you, it‚Äôs not friendship he actually wants, it‚Äôs for you to assuage his own guilt. If you consent to being friends with him after he dumped you, he can convince himself that you weren‚Äôt actually all that hurt by the breakup, so he doesn‚Äôt have to process his bad feelings. 

He had every right to end your relationship. But he has *no* right to be a part of your life after it‚Äôs over. That decision rests with you alone."
There's a grain of truth here in that some guys will pretend to want a relationship just to have sex- but they don't stick around for an entire year. 
Apologize for what? Not having kids? Or for enjoying spending time with her niblings?
"You can't change someone who is unwilling to be open to other possibilities outside of their own view. You said multiple times in this post that he isn't interested in how you got out of your situation. 

My experience with my husband was the polar opposite. When I told him about the things I went through in the worst parts of my depression and while I was homeless. He quietly listened, and was empathetic with me when I was done. We also had very different upbringings. He's told me my experiences have encouraged him to take a step back when talking about situations that he doesn't have first hand experience with, and to listen instead of explain what's wrong.

Counseling is an option, but again, if he's not open, there's not much that can be done there. You could establish a ban on discussing all things poverty-related, but that's more of a band-aid than an actual solution.

"With bed bugs, you want to check between layers of the bed for signs of them, because that's where they congregate. So between the sheets, between the mattress and box spring, that sort of thing. They leave black-ish ""dirt"" everywhere. From what I've seen, bed bugs are very small and brownish, but I am not an expert. 

You would be well within your right to break up with him. He's a big boy, he should be doing his own laundry and cleaning. While what you did was a nice gesture, with someone that lazy about cleanliness, it only sets the precedent that they can just leave their mess and you'll clean up after them. And if his bedroom is so unhygenic, I would be questioning all his other hygiene. You are a very clean and tidy person, he is not. You can break up with someone for any reason, and this wouldn't be an overreaction in my opinion."
"Are they giving you all of these perks due to the country being undesirable in some way (e.g. dangerous, oppressive, etc.)? It sounds like hazard pay. That would also line up with Mike ""disagreeing"" with the country. If that's true, I think that your potential lifestyle there is something to consider, since I haven't seen another commenter bring it up yet. However, this decision is up to you, and if you think that this job is going to take you places in your career and you really want it, then you should take the job and go."
It‚Äôs defintielty worthy of kudos since a lot of people in that position would not say anything. 
"I don't understand all the people saying OP is *absolutely* owed a full explanation of what's going on.

It sounds to me like the dad is saying ""It's not anything you need to be concerned about."" And he's pretty unconcerned. I don't understand why people think OP is owed an account of her parents sex life. Or why the fuck she would *want* that. 

The one time my mom (while tipsy) even *began* to talk to me about their sex life, I couldn't have ran away fast enough. I get that they're my parents and they have sex. But that doesn't mean I want to think about it!

To be honest, I don't even know that I think she deserves to know if the mom is cheating. If the parents are getting divorced, sure. But if they're trying to work out private relationship stuff by themselves, I don't know if OP needs to know that. "

What kind of evidence so you have though. This is regarding the others wife. It's hard to go down that route but with the right evidence it should be fine. May as well mess them both up for this. Cheating is bad and shouldn't be stood for. The problem telling the wife is she may not believe you or doesn't want to know. So what is the evidence?? "

"Stop jumping for the check. Stop humouring him. Yay for Chad, his genes got a little bit busier on the 'tall' scale, whoop-de-fucking-do. His personality was the bit that got cut for time, though. If he doesn't want to give the check up, stop playing his game. He's trying to get a rise out of you, so when you stop playing his game, he doesn't get what he wants. Learn some grey rock answers to his terrible 'lol, ur short' jokes. 

- ""Wow. Thanks for pointing that out."" 
- ""I'm short? Nobody ever told me. Thank you so much for pointing it out!""

- ""Okay. Thanks for the short joke. Anyway, moving on...""
- ""That's nice. Anyway...""
- ""Interesting. Besides that, I think we should do xyz...."" 

Also, stop thinking of it in terms of 'humbled you' about your height. You're five seven, that's your lot in life, and unless you fancy painful surgery, perma-stilts, or only working in pre-schools, you're *always* going to run into people taller than you, and some of them will be douchebags who don't understand how humans work. Accept that. Height is height but winning personalities are more important and I think you got some advantage over Chad-the-man-who-can't-get-over-high-school. You can't think of it in terms of 'winning' the game with him, or him having the upper hand because he'll pretty much always have the upper hand in a workplace where nepotism exists. The way to think of it is 'grade school bully' and 'a grown ass man who is behaving like a little boy on a playground'. Rise above his games. Learn to let it roll off your back. A height joke works when the short guy reacts. When he embraces the fact he's five seven, confidence wins out in the equation. "
"&gt; So we joke about how ‚Äúmartha‚Äù was ugly like a shaven baboon so she wrapped herself up in a blanket cocoon, and in 2 weeks she‚Äôll finally emerge and smell like shit, what a psycho.

&gt; I even joke around saying how I could imagine her going clothes shopping and picking out different blankets from the bedding aisle.

Those aren't jokes. They're not funny. They're really mean. What is wrong with you? Your sister obviously has some really terrible issues with self esteem that are manifesting in a really concerning way and you guys are making fun of her and trying to rip her cover off of her. She needs therapy and people who support her."
"There are several other fora elsewhere on the internet as well. As an exmormon, I found exmormon dot org to be supremely helpful and healing. It's really, really nice to have a support community of people who understand what you've gone through and who have experienced the same things. "

"&gt; I mean, she could have easily gotten her own blanket.

so could have he instead of getting steadily madder at a person who was fucking asleep. he caused his own issue with this by not just realizing she's unconsciously doing this, got up, walked 10 feet to the closet, pulled out a blanket, gone back to bed and went back to sleep without worrying about it. instead of finding an immediate, but temporary, solution like an adult, he turned into an angry child."
"There‚Äôs a bunch of other stuff going on here that you should take notice of, but I have a single small piece of advice: couples don‚Äôt need to share blankets.

I‚Äôve been with my husband for over 20 years, and we‚Äôve always had two duvets. I doubt I would ever enjoy a full night‚Äôs sleep if we didn‚Äôt (he fidgets, I burrito).

But it‚Äôs really not about the blankets."

"You keep blocking him, and encourage your female friends to do likewise. Sadly, this isn't uncommon. "

"At the risk of getting so downvoted you won't be able to see this, don't let /r/relationship's determination that everything be a physical affair overwhelm you.  There *are,* in fact, men who are both terrible with money management and willing to fork over money simply because of an emotional affair.  Sometimes it's even *not* getting what you physically want that turns it into a blind obsession, because rather than being a real person who is just okay at sex that you eventually get wise to, the object of lust is a fantasy whose perfection is kept just out of reach.  On top of that, some people are more heart than brains.  That doesn't forgive what he did (he still showed tons of heart and compassion for a manipulative stripper and zero for his wife and children, which for me would absolutely be a deal-breaker), but you make him sound passively selfish and dumb as fuck, rather than actively on the prowl.  

Now granted, it's equally possible that he *did* have sex with her, but just because the people of /r/relationships (of which I obviously am one) speak with confidence about what *must* have happened, it doesn't make it so.  We don't have any more context or evidence than you do (much less, actually), so try not to let the sheer weight of numbers cement your mind about something.

Personally, I'm pissed on your behalf that your relationship has been trusting and open enough to maintain a poly lifestyle but your husband somehow found a way to cheat anyway, not to mention losing $60,000 worth of savings in the process.  This must be shocking and heartbreaking on so many levels, and I'm sorry you have to go through this.  You seem smart enough and practical enough to come out of it stronger than you went in, but you have my sympathies that you have to go through it at all."
"&gt;Be as honest as possible, and as genuine as you can. Be vulnerable. Be sincere.

I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. OP has, by her own admission, spousified her son and turned him into a emotional support figure. The last thing their relationship needs is a FEELINGSBOMB where she attempts to make him feel guilty for setting up boundaries.

What OP needs to do is start being the adult in this situation."
"Sounds selfish, but I'm afraid that if I ask her abut the hushing she would ""realize"" its wrong and we would go back to square one.  The relationship have improved dramatically after I started hushing, our sexual and financial lives are healthy and when we get along, at least 80% of the time,  things are great.  I would definitely start with the book before going to counseling.  Thank you so much for your input"
"She will 100% be doing the majority of dog care, don't lie to yourself.  You think the animal just switches off when you're at work?"
"&gt;She is afraid that she will be left to care for the dog while I'm at work - she is home during the day most days, while I work a pretty standard 9-5 - and she doesn't want that responsibility. I know that she will need to do some caring for the dog while I am at work, but have assured her that the majority of it will be mine to handle.

Sorry, but this is just factually incorrect. She will not need to do ""some caring"" for the dog while you're at work, she will need to do all the caring for the dog for most of the day. The majority of the dog's care will be taken care of by the person who is home during the day, which is her. 

Feeding, taking it outside to pee/poop, taking it to appointments (vet, groomer, etc); training, cleaning up messes (or is she going to leave dog crap on the floor for you to clean up when you get home from work--something I'm sure you wouldn't roll your eyes, sigh, or get annoyed about doing?), making sure it doesn't decide her underwear or your socks make great chew toys, having to keep an eye on the dog if she has food around (it's never fun to make yourself some lunch, step into the living room to grab something, and come back to find the dog has snatched it up) etc etc. And that's all assuming the dog won't have annoying quirks like barking at everything or peeing when it gets over-excited.

&gt;It honestly feels as though she is prioritizing her own sense of satisfaction over my happiness. 

It sounds like she wants an engagement and, based on your comments, you don't see engagement as a necessary commitment. If you want her to commit to raising a dog with you, she wants you to commit to a future with her. Time for a serious talk about the future. "
"Her mother never supported her once in during her *6 month* rehabilitation. No visit. No contact.

It was more important to lie about where Op was than to care about her daughter's health for half a year.

And after that time? She tries to bully Op into keeping up this ridiculous lie she's invested in. Why? To not *embarrass* her in front of friends and family.

When Op rightfully says ""no"" because it's her mental health in the line? Her mother decides again, instead of supporting her child, to proceed to lose her gotdam mind.

She hits every red button she knows Op has because she's mad and humiliated by the thought that she might be found out in effort to bully Op into doing what she wants. 

Thank god for dad.

And then, after everything comes out, Op's mom just blocks her daughter and goes on a lying parade. 

Do any one of these things make an awful person? Maybe not. But all of them together is pretty damning. "
"I married a man who was a virgin when we met, not even held hands with a girl. No experience of any sort of relationship. We've been together 12 years, happily married for 10 years, we have a son and his lack of experience has never really had any impact on our relationship. I did talk to him about whether he'd want to explore relationships with other women before we married and he told me he was quite happy with only sleeping with one woman in his entire life and had no desire to ""sow his oats"" or any of that jazz. I trusted him on that. It's definitely a conversation to have, but don't presume that's a problem for someone when it really might not be.

I think you're overthinking things. I do think some people find the one they spend their life with at the first go, and sometimes that's a little later in life than others. If he's not actually giving you any signs of the things you fear, then I wouldn't let anxiety or fear of the unknown hold you back.

Judge him based on his actions and work through problems as they crop up. Don't create a problem when there isn't one."

At only one month in, things are supposed to be easy and happy. If you're having problems already, you two aren't right for each other. Why on earth would you stay with someone when things were rocky from the start? Why wouldn't you dump him so you'd both be free to find someone more compatible?

You two have no trust, and you have incompatible boundaries (he thinks he has the right to pick your friends), communication problems, (fights about the same topic where nothing gets resolved), incompatible emotional needs (he needs constant reassurance you're not cheating, you need to not feel accused of cheating).  So with ALL those problems, and only in the first month of your relationship, why are still talking to this guy?! 

When you see red flags and early incompatibilities, you walk away. You don't ""fight for the relationship"" when it's doomed from the start."
"He is 23 goddamn years old.  If he doesn't know that he must respect boundaries, especially after everything going on in the news in the last six months, then it seems like he may need a strong consequence like being kicked out of his house and losing his friends to ""get it.""  And if he doesn't ""get it"" soon he's going to wind up in jail.

Also this isn't something you fuck around with and gently try to fix with an ""aw gee well maybe eventually he'll learn!.""  Do you know how traumatizing it can be for someone to violate your clear boundaries?  Do you know how many women he may have hurt?"
"If you haven't already done this - take a minute to tell your dad you appreciate everything he's done for you.

That kind of thing is golden to hear when you're a parent, but also incredibly rare."
"You've still got a big family. Four siblings. That's it, don' t look anywhere else. Some people aren't as lucky as you.

"
"I mean you have your mind set up. It's just going to barrel toward that end. You're emotionally mature enough to realize how stupid it is to move cross country with someone you've known for a year while you're in a high stress school and she's got no job prospects. 

I really think it's best to break up at least when you graduate. "
"I came to a similar conclusion. Wife is burnt out from bearing the household burden, doesn‚Äôt feel appreciated or wooed by her husband, and now that she‚Äôs said something OP is kicking his ass into gear with these grand gestures of love. It‚Äôs a pretty common story. "
"You do realize that she's working too, right? Taking care of 3 young kids is a JOB, so she's working just the same amount of time (no, more actually) than he is.  Stay at home parents need time to decompress for a while and just be an adult again too.  The fact that her husband doesn't see that is insane."
"I think you're probably right. Also, just because you've not minded touching in the past (though from your post it was of a different nature) does not mean you have to put up with touching now. Do not feel guilty for telling someone to stop doing something that made you feel uncomfortable. "
"Fair enough. I kind of posted a response to that that seems inappropriate now. Sorry. Maybe edit your post to something about 'not raising your kids in high crime areas'.

The word ghetto has a lot of racist baggage to it. I'm a middle class black professional in Britain and I've had that term hurled at me. Your future biracial kids will probably hear it or a version of it too. Be careful how you use that term around your kids especially as it seems like you're labeling half their family as that."
"Call CPS and the non-emergency police line, and talk to your school counsellor and/or a trusted teacher. Pack any important valuables in a getaway bag in case you need to leave in a hurry. 

And absolutely take your friend's family up on their offer. They wouldn't offer if they couldn't afford it. Sometimes people just genuinely want to do a good thing and don't need payment in return. Wouldn't you, if you were older and your kid's BFF was in your shoes? Just go and be a great housemate and pay it forward when you get the chance. 

Also, social services may pay some expenses while you're in the system. Look into what you're eligible for. "
"What if she's not cheating, but she just goes on with the relationship as-is, no sex, no intimacy, no love, feeling like a non-priority.  I guess my point is that you don't have to **prove** she's cheating to want to end things and move on.

For the cheating, it does look pretty shady.  If you want to wait until after Valentine's Day weekend to confront, you can do that.  If you confront her today about the mystery lingerie, she might say she was saving it for V-day (unless it's clearly not in new condition).  Of course, she may still come up with an excuse even if you wait until V-day is well past.  I am guessing you don't have her passcode or she guards her phone like her life depends on it.

I would say the only saving grace is you're not married.  That always makes things easier in these situations.  "
Why would you ask such a general question when I was being pretty specific in my post? You know perfectly well that‚Äôs not what i said. 
"Honestly, she sounds a little unstable if that was her reaction.

Also, whenever I hear anyone described as ‚Äúfierce‚Äù when it comes to political issues I feel wary. It just screams ‚ÄúI have no clue how to communicate my point so I‚Äôll just yell the loudest.‚Äù"
"&gt; he's working 30 extra hours a week by choice

She should get 30 hours a week of whatever she'd prefer, as well, imo. Gym, career stuff she mentioned, whatever. Bizarre that he thinks he can just bail out of all waking hours of his children's time and still control what goes on in the house. "

"Google the National Domestic violence helpline.  They have chat on their website, or a phone number she can call.  She is in an abusive relationship and she needs their expertise.  They can tell her the best way to protect herself, what to do, what to say to the police, and hopefully provide a contact for counselling at the nearest DV shelter.

Your friend's safety is at risk, please contact them ASAP.

"
"Yeaah, I'm giving OP serious side-eye here. I saw a lot of IT AFFECTED MEEEE and nothing really about how hard it was on HIS WIFE who was carrying HIS CHILD and she was dealing with LIFE ALTERING physical changes, but cool, no, let's make it all about YOU. So you worked full time and went home and also did housework- fucking hell, welcome to the reality of the majority of married women. Sucks, doesn't it? 

I'm seeing an issue here, and it isn't your wife wanting another child."
"There's this old old story from an ask reddit about about dumb students, and someone responded with a list of ways that this kid, Kevin, was the dumbest of the dumb. My personal favorite example was that he didn't know cats and dogs were different animals. There's even a subreddit dedicated to stories about people acting like ""Kevins"". Is any of it real? Who knows, but I cry laughing every time I read the original.

Edit to add- just Google something like ""Kevin reddit dumb"" and the original should pop up. It's a classic that's been retold many times "
"First thing she gotta do is properly break up with him, because it seems like they never did that.



Then she can tell him if she keeps stalking her you'll get the police involved."
"The ONLY acceptable actions from him after you cheated are:

A) He breaks up with you because he can no longer trust you. 

B) He forgives you, you both postpone the wedding, then you guys go to couples counseling and work on rebuilding trust in the relationship. Depending on how therapy goes you either get married or take option A. 

That‚Äôs it. 

Those are the only two acceptable options. 

There is no third option where it‚Äôs totally ok for him hold this over your head for the rest of your lives, repeatedly accuse you of cheating, and physically abuse you. He is 100% in the wrong here.

**While cheating is never ok it does not justify verbal and/or physical abuse against the cheater. Abuse and domestic violence is ALWAYS wrong no matter what!!**

*It doesn‚Äôt matter that you cheated*- he is the one who is wrong here. Just because you made a bad choice does not make it OK for him to hurt your feelings or your body. 

YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS!!

YOU STILL DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT!! 
"
"I would say some people are just not great at giving gifts, just consider it part of who she is, part of her personality.  I'm sure there are other parts of her that aren't ideal, but that's part of being in a relationship taking the good with the bad, especially when it's something this petty.

Some people are very into holidays and birthdays, and other people(like me) really couldn't care less about holidays and birthdays.  I'm happy to get a phone call or even a just a quick post on my Facebook wall.  That's just my personality.  It doesn't mean that i'm selfish or rude or a partypooper, because i'm not, I'm very generous in other ways, i just don't invest a lot in specific commercial holidays."
"Why was the aunt wrong? She didn't say 'OP's GF, you will change your mind."" She made a generic statement and described her own experience of how when she was OP's GF's age, she and a lot of women felt that way and eventually changed their minds. There was nothing offensive about what the aunt said. And OP's GF was the one who brought up the subject. So can't blame aunt for that either. If she doesn't want a conversation about child bearing, then why bring it up anyway? GF is clearly carrying baggage from another conversation into this one with the aunt. "
"If you don't want another kid, you are COMPLETELY justified in not having another kid. "

"Your wife is a brat and a slob.  She sounds full of herself.

You make the mess, you clean it.

You make the mess together?  You clean it up together.

Period.

Having said that, it sounds like money isn't an issue for you guys, so might I suggest trying to keep things a little tidier on the day-to-day and having a cleaning service come a few times a month."
"Exactly! If he's so ""over it"" and so bound and determined not to discuss it then why in the great goddamn did he bring it up at all!?

OP your husband does not get to say something like that and unilaterally decide that you won't be discussing it further. That's maybe how you communicate something to your three year old when they pull the cats tail, not how you communicate with a spouse.

Now I'm taking on faith that he legitimately believed at the time that you cheated, he did have the ""evidence"" that the doctor provided and he trusted what the guy said. I get that. And this isn't as cut and dried as say someone telling him you cheated and he believed it even though the dates don't match and you have proof it never happened or whatever. He thought it happened and he had reasons (however wrong they ultimately turned out to be) to believe it happened.

He opened the door to this discussion he supposedly doesn't want to have when he brought this up. Its childish and manipulative to pull that kind of nonsense. You guys NEED to have a serious conversation about this. You need to tell him exactly where you're coming from and you also have to listen to what he has to say but you have to discuss this like grownups.

If the reality is that he's hung on to this for years so he can sort of hold it over your head (even if you don't know he's doing it) that he's such an amazing guy that he stood by you when you did something so awful then that's another kettle of fish. There's something reallllyyy awful about that. It doesn't say very flattering things about the kind of guy he really is.

Also OP I would primarily be concerned not with how has he been able to trust you all these years if he still believes this. I'd be more concerned with why he didn't believe you the first time.
"
"Does that justify you unloading onto someone who just said it once? Nop. 

His GF is a fully grown adult. This is not how fully grown adults behave."
"While your SO can totally be innocent and just playing the nice guy, you can‚Äôt be sure about the girl, especially when you know, and he knows that she has a crush on him. It‚Äôs not entirely impossible that she might set him up by making him drunk, or even drug, to take advantage of him. Maybe I‚Äôm thinking too much, idk, but despite the fact that she knows he‚Äôs in a relationship she still asked him out makes it seems suspicious to me.

And if I were you I would definitely talk to your SO about your feeling on this situation, especially about how disrespectful his sister is to you."
"&gt;Is this what dating is like nowadays? You get intimate with someone and dump them off a few days later? 

That is exactly how dating works. You spend a few dates getting to know someone and decide whether or not you're compatible. Slow wayyyyyyyy down next time. A few good dates isn't a lifelong commitment. "
Likr someone else said there's wic and welfare.  Welfare also tracks down the other parent and makes them give court ordered child support.  She is young and there is many programs that can help if she actually looks for them instead of at you. 
"Oh my god. 

**First, your husband is emotionally abusive. A LOT of people are going to recommend therapy/counseling, but please be aware that abusers just take the tools learned in therapy and weaponize them against you. Emotional abuse leaves deep wounds and you need to be healthy for those babies!! Please do research on emotional abuse before you attempt any kind of treatment with him. loveisrespect . org is a great place to start. Please take the quiz.**

He put the lives of you and your children at serious risk. So much shit can go wrong when giving birth to twins, and one or both of your babies plus you could die very very quickly. *It happens all the fucking time.*

My sister was a NICU nurse *and* just had twins herself. If you had heard her stories from the many many births she has attended to, you would have already called a lawyer to file for divorce. 

I would never ever be able to trust someone as a partner, as a parent, as a fucking minimally respectable human being after he fucking gaslit me and blew me off when going into labor with twins. Then he has the fucking nerve to rewrite history and make you look like the reckless idiot? 

Just.. wow. 

What else will he ignore? What if your kid says they‚Äôre in pain, or someone did something that felt wrong to them, or if they‚Äôre scared or depressed or have an allergic reaction or any number of other things? Not to mention the fact that now, more than ever, you absolutely need to know that he has your back. 

You and your kids aren‚Äôt safe with this man. 

I‚Äôve spent a LOT of time in r/relationships for a couple years now, and I think this is one of the most horrifying posts I‚Äôve ever seen. "
"I‚Äôm with you and also so frustrated reading everyone compare those to thinking a person on the street is attractive.

There is a PRETTY WIDE CHASM between the freedom to naturally find other people attractive and going on to social media and publicly handing out validation in the form of likes to a women who is posting provocative selfies because she needs validation as a sexually appealing person. 

We like things for THE POSTER‚ÄôS benefit, first and foremost. Using ‚Äòlikes‚Äô as an easy way to save things pf interest is fine...but in this context, it is a really
flimsy defense.

The compromise OP is willing to make is not even going to stop him from looking at her and finding her sexy.

Dude has the option of just keeping it to his damn self and he wont. Pathetic. "

"Since someone liked this comment enough to gild it, I feel compelled to reply. Your reaction is exactly how I fear he will feel. Respectfully, I completely disagree. This wasn't ""something dumb"". This was a horrible thing that happened to real person that my sister and I might be in class with. And his reaction was to blame her. He made several assumptions to put the blame on this girl. This isn't debate team, this a real situation with a real person and could easily apply to any of his daughters. My reaction was completely in line with my justified emotions. And perhaps you missed the part where I said a rarely get angry?"

"Have you tried any therapy or anything for your anxiety?



I feel like you are projecting way too hard, do you like programing? Do you enjoy your job?




Just because she might not want to be a programmer doesn't mean she looks down at the profession. She likely really admires that you can do what you do. Or thinks you're lucky that you never have to work in the rain or with manure. 




The negative thoughts you have about your job or choices are *yours*. She isn't demeaning your job or comparing your lives, you are doing that.

"&gt; Could it be something I‚Äôm doing wrong?

No. Every abuser blames the victim for the abuser's behavior. "
"It's your guys personal wants. You want children, he doesn't. It sucks, and it's probably heart breaking but if you want kids, and this relationship never gives you that, at what point will you start to regret not having kids ? 
It's hard as hell, but I don't think there is anything wrong with breaking up to find a relationship where you can have kids. 

Maybe have a few more sit downs with your boyfriend on deciding. Maybe consider adopting, or fostering kids ? Maybe it's just the baby aspect of it he doesn't like, but then you probably want your own flesh and blood. 

It could be that he is still at a young age, maybe people in our age range didn't want kids til their 30s. But then again, if you waited a few more years, and he still doesn't want kids, it leaves you at this decision again."

When there are waves he all but disappears.  She‚Äôs fine with this, but they‚Äôre trying for a family soon.  He‚Äôs already offered up, on his own volition, that he knows he cannot sustain that with a kid.  That he will not be able to surf every day before work because they‚Äôll be getting kids up and prepped for school, etc. 

With a kid involved, I‚Äôd expect ANY person to re-evaluate their relationship with their hobbies and behaviors.   "

I'll chip in that sexual preference isn't a binary gay or straight, as you probably already know.  There's a lot of grey areas in there, so don't focus so much on the labels and just enjoy and explore what you have together."
"Honestly, I don't even think it's about the kids, it's about this guy's general priorities.

It sounds like he just watches the kids for a couple hours each day before their mom gets home. There's plenty of time in the day to work, watch the kids for a short time, and then spend a good amount of time with your SO.

But then he's got his unique and very specific work/sleep schedule, which includes extra work hours (to ""get work out of the way while he's young""). And his soccer/basketball games. And his friend hangout sessions. And his ""learning something new"" sessions. All of which are more important to him than OP.

Really, I think all the stuff about the kids is less important than this quote

&gt; That drives me crazy and I hate how he can make time to work more or go play with a ball in the middle of the night instead of making time with me during the day.

OP, you are the lowest priority in this man's life. You're not his partner in a loving, respectful relationship - you're the person he'll *maybe* hang out with, if he's not playing basketball, or watching the kids, or gettin some extra hours of work in, or reading a book...

Don't waste anymore time on this guy."

"You completely nailed the issues on the head that because of the reaction, now has been brought to light too. He does have a pattern of selfish behavior. I work so much that my interactions with him are limited (and I like that), so it does bring up alot of thought going forward. Job wise for me though, I work remote for most of my jobs, so that works for me. I do have a retail store in my town that the lease will be up in a few months. I'm going to concentrate on unloading the inventory (which since it's crystals and other fun things, I have no issue keeping it either LMAO)

I think I may seek the advice of a counselor. I am sure he will actually try to come with when push comes to shove, and I don't know if I really want him to anymore. I actually think I'd rather be on my own.

"It's his wedding too and he wants to include his immediate family, just like she is, it's not unreasonable in the slightest.

Just because they are childfree doesn't mean that they're isn't going to be children in their lives.

"I understand how angry you must be at your wife. Actually, I've never been betrayed to that degree, so I likely don't. But I can imagine. 

But I urge you not to allow that anger to fuck up your children. Playing favorites with your daughter will psychologically damage the twins. They'll know you didn't want them and don't love them and they won't understand why. At least children who are adopted/fostered don't have to interact even tangentially with the parent who abandoned them. And specifically only them because you'll still be around and celebrating the birthdays, etc of the sister. It's cruel. And if I were the mother at some point I'd probably sue to for full custody with no visitation for you because your willingness to harm your twins--still you children, even though you don't agree--shows you to be an unfit parent. 

There will be a lot of therapy in your childrens' future if you go through with this. It wasn't their fault. And if you alienate them, it won't be your wife's fault either--it will be yours. "
"Dude, so in your mind, only these restrictions are keeping her from cheating? Once you drop these she'll be cheating again.  A break up now is better and less expensive than a divorce later.

You deserve someone who looks at you and thinks how they could never do something to hurt you the way your lousy excuse of a boyfriend does now. End it. No matter how the conversation goes. And about that: What does that mean? If he pretends to be nice for five minutes, you'll plan on forgiving everything? What's the plan here? "

Is he coming to her when they have disagreements? Is she offering advice? And if so, is that advice coming from a place of neutral friendship or from someone who really wouldn't mind if Kevin and his girlfriend broke up? "

She couldn't get to her bedroom when she was already in her own house. I think you're being optimistic to assume she could get all the way to her own dorm if she felt a meltdown coming on. College campuses are huge, bustling places. My dorm room was over a mile from my classes. I'm sure Noelle can manage to graduate college, but she'll need support. I don't think living across the country on her own is a realistic-sounding goal, and OP doesn't seem to realize that. That's probably (one of) the source of his wife's frustration.  "
"The worst thing I call my dog is dickbreath, and that's because of bully sticks.

OP, you deserve better."
"&gt;However, I have known my friend a long time and I am sure he is looking out for my best interest.

How? How is this looking out for YOUR best interest?"
Completely agree. You see a lot of posts on this sub where you have people who are only 1-2 years apart and problems arise in their relationship because of the difference in life milestones and goals.
No grown up ever needs to consider fucking with someone's employment over relationship issues. That guy has no right to be giving relationship advice here.
"People with autism often have comorbid anxiety disorders. Studies have shown that modified CBT can help people with autism improve their coping skills.

You and your wife could probably benefit from couple's counseling. Today its your wife snapping, but if you don't take care of yourself, tomorrow it could be you. "
That's what my bestfriend said. I have sacrificed so much for him and I have never spoken to him that way no matter how mad I would get so I know for a fact that I do not deserve being spoken to like that. 
"Yeah, I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs this. As we see frequently on Reddit, ‚Äúmy life is great‚Äù or ‚Äúmy life is fine apart from these niggles‚Äù dont get comments. ‚ÄúMy bitch wife‚Äù gets hundreds. Maybe he started out posting real facts, and just started tweaking details over time to fit what got a reaction until it doesn‚Äôt really resemble anything. I doubt he genuinely, really thinks this stuff about OP, it‚Äôs just a fantasy.

I wonder though, why does he feel like he needs that sympathy? What reaction does he get from friends, family and OP when he complains about his life - is it possible he feels like he can‚Äôt go to any of them for emotional support and ends up having to exaggerate online to get it? He says he doesn‚Äôt feel respected at work, maybe there are other things he has going on that he doesn‚Äôt want to express in case people dismiss it because he‚Äôs realistically at the top and shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúplay the victim‚Äù. Yeah he was an idiot for doing this and I would be mad too, but there could be a reason behind it that would let them strengthen their relationship by exploring."
"It might depend on what regional branch of Goodwill it is. They're under a parent organization, but regional chapters of the organization are independently operated. So you'll find some pretty widely different policies from region to region.

Even so, OP, are you sure he talked to a manager and not just a cashier or something? Accidental donations are extremely common and at the branch I work for, we always at least _try_ to find the donation before it gets sold. The longer it's been, the less likely be can track down individual donations, but we always at least  told in-store employees to keep an eye out and sent an email to our distribution center with the info (the store I worked in got more donations than we could process, so they would get sent out to stores that got fewer). Sometimes we could track down the stuff, sometimes it had already been sold. But it's pretty nasty to just say they can't do anything."
"Usually people buy bigger houses and rent smaller apartments. It's likely she wouldn't consider renting a home like that.  Yeah, lots of things to consider here."
"My boyfriend may well buy a house before me. And I flat out told him I have no interest in co-ownership before marriage. I said if he did and asked me to move in, I would be paying rent. He insisted that wasn‚Äôt fair because I would be helping with the mortgage. And i said ‚Äúlook, I‚Äôd be paying rent to live elsewhere if I wasn‚Äôt moving in with you, so what does it matter if I pay the rent to you instead?‚Äù

He finally agreed. 

It‚Äôs an inherently reasonable decision not to invest in $100k+ commitments and debt before marriage. My boyfriend has two kids. He‚Äôs got to put those two first in a stable home and not risk a breakup and a nasty girlfriend forcing him to have to sell his house if he can‚Äôt buy her out..."
"He might like you, but he definitely does not respect you. To intentionally take the opposite position of every issue from you, even issues like whether YOU have the right to be offended by something, shows a contrarian nature that probably stems from basic disrespect.

I wouldn't want to stay in a relationship with or even be friends with somebody who is purposefully oppositional."
She compared you to her ex too. Clearly an unhealthy relationship that you need to remove yourself from.

No need to ham it up.
"Agree - this sounds like a good way to balance things.  Basically, she pays rent but less than market value and less than she would be if she were renting on her own, so that way she can save $ and build equity that way.  OP pays a little more in mortgage to ""make up"" for the fact that he is indeed gaining quite a bit in equity/long term financial stability that she isn't.  It doesn't sound like the girlfriend is ready to buy a house yet anyways, so it's not like that is an opportunity cost she's giving up.  If they do get married (or otherwise achieve a long term relationship goal of their choosing), he can add her to the deed and they can move towards splitting the risk/reward of home ownership equally.

And, your point about buying a house that he can afford solo is an *excellent* one that can't be over-emphasized.  OP should be really cautious to not depend on her $ contribution to the mortgage - otherwise he's up shit creek if they break up."
"&gt; had she posted here with her side of the story everyone would be telling her that she's stupid and naive to even consider for a *second* that Molly could be lying.

And yet this sub has also ripped into posters for believing lies over their partners. There's little room for nuance here."
"Yeah, I don‚Äôt think I believe the OP."
"To save you perhaps months of worry, it is my understanding that a paternity test can be carried out before it's born, so ask the Dr about that (or Google ""*in utero* paternity testing"")"
"Restrict your conversations to text/email so that you can document (have proof) of his irresponsible behavior.  Collect your evidence, then contact CPS and/or the court to report his negligence so that you can get full custody."
"This isn't illegal and honestly its none of your business. He didn't even want you to know.Everyone makes dumb choices when it comes to early romances. But, if you do tell, be prepared to have your friend hate you forever. "

"What's her long-term plan? I get that getting out of a controlling relationship is hard, but it has been 6 months. If she moves out, how is she going to feed/clothe herself and her child as well as go to any appointments?

You don't have to let her stay in one of your houses, but if you're considering this, you should figure that out."
"It doesn't matter if it was a fling. IT WAS WITH HER SISTER. You chose to sleep with her sister. You're choosing to lie to her. I mean it's also selfish cause god forbid either of you had an STD and your gf got it as a result. Let's turn the tables for a moment, imagine that you were in your girlfriends situation and she slept with your brother or best friend while you were broke up. How would you feel about her lying to you? "
"But after that, you have to decide if you are going to throw away your precious 20‚Äôs on a guy that is not sure he wants to marry you.

4 years dating and a college education later, is enough time and experience for him to know if you are the person he wants to marry.

Don‚Äôt count yourself short, you sound like a nice person. You are only young and carefree, and in your 20‚Äôs once and only for a short time as compared to your entire life. This is your best opportunity to set up your future to best support your goals.  Don‚Äôt allow anyone to make you wait for years and years to live your life.

Good luck to you."
"6 kids! Seriously, no matter if you are aware of it or not, the lifestyle of a surgeons family have different needs than say the lifestyle of a small business owners family.

And the cost of educating these children and housing them and paying for sports and whatnot is very expensive.  The OP and his wife needs to decide exactly what type of lifestyle they are going to live, and it may be that his career will no longer match their lifestyle.

Maybe he has to work now and then retire back to his hobby. 
"
I said it below but $60k in any major city with 6 kids is nothing. 
"Fellow female gamer here (let's play league sometime!) -- your boyfriend basically told you that since you didnt gratify his ego by laughing at some meme, you deserve to be treated like shit.  When you drew a boundary and called out his fuckery, he accused you of starting a fight.

In short, he would prefer you passively accept whatever treatment he deigns to give you.

You're the only one who can decide whether this is behaviour you're willing to tolerate."
"I'd be disgusted and furious, not to mention that with the kind of gross arseholes who'd comment that she'd better sell her body, doxxing could be a concern. "
This is a long distance relationship and he is being distant. If you get any closer in the next few years things may change but you're not close enough to his family now for it to matter to your relationship either way. See your friend off. Friends are for life. 
"You don't have to get stepped on anymore. You know what it looks like, so end it as soon as it starts. Guys are ""always"" doing things like this to you because you are staying far too long in relationships with shitty people. It's not you. There's not some tragic flaw inside you that attracts these shitty men. **Most** of the men you meet and date are going to be wrong for you. 99% of the people **everyone** dates are wrong for each other. The only thing you're doing wrong is staying in a shitty relationship with a shitty partner hoping that if you compromise enough, if you bend over backwards enough, if you make your needs small enough, if you excuse crappy behavior enough, some day this shitty person will magically transform into a not-shitty person. That's never going to happen. Never. 

Stop accepting less than you deserve. Stop giving chances to men who aren't worth your time. Look for a decent, quality man who suits you, who likes you, who wants to be with you, and who treats you well. "
You might as well just tell her that you don't agree she had any right to enter your room and that you will be moving out. Or just ignore it. You're not going to be able to make her realize what she's doing is wrong so really any sort of response is just going to have you be dragged into an argument.
Must suck to get told bad things for a few hours a week. Kinda like what your wife deals with every day?
"Yup. My kid picked up the flu and spread it in the family. 3 out of 4 got sick and we‚Äôre all vaccinated. Same at work. 3 out of 6 got it, 2 of the 3 vaccinated. The vaccine still helped, it ‚Äúonly‚Äù lasted 3 days for most of us. But newborn?! Nope!"
"There is honestly no point to deleting the video.  I can guarantee that Amazon saved a copy as soon as the delivery person reported in having been punched.  That's the whole point of Amazon Key: it's a cloud service.

If you wouldn't put up with a behavior sober, don't put up with it drunk.  He should not be punching people, drunk or sober.  He should not be punching strangers, drunk or sober.   If he claims the alcohol makes him punch people, then it's on him to stop drinking.

&gt;  I can't decide if it's time to go through with it or not. 

&gt;  the way he just abruptly punched an innocent Chinese man in his delirious state made it feel like I was watching a psychopath.

"Adult life *with a stable source of income* is honestly easy mode life. The stable source of income is important, because without it, of course, it's much more stressful (since as a teen most people have all of that taken care of). People who think being an adult (with a source of income) is more difficult than being a teen are just whining, or fucking up somewhere. Obviously there are circumstances where that isn't true such as health issues etc but otherwise all things being equal..."
"Really good advice, op. "
"I think the better questions are (I) if you don‚Äôt go, can you deal with the what if? And (Ii) if you do go and her last words are ‚ÄúI always hated you and I still do‚Äù what is that going to do to you?

I have asked myself some similar questions because I don‚Äôt talk to my dad for Reasons. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm ok never figuring out a ‚Äúcome to Jesus‚Äù big conversation. I‚Äôm happier and healthier without.

Ask yourself what you can cope with and do that, and if you may feel a lingering what if, then seek therapy to help you manage that. It‚Äôs not enough of a reason to put yourself in potential harms way but you‚Äôd be sensible to prepare yourself.

For what it‚Äôs worth - it seems to me that she‚Äôs sorry, and she may have changed. But I‚Äôd probably still not go, in the end. "
I call it my butt-hawk
I‚Äôm starting to think I am too. 
"Yeah, that's it. We both hate condoms, to be fair. But I asked him after our daughter's birth almost 2 years ago to look into a vasectomy and he's not done it yet. I've had a miscarriage since then and last month needed Plan B.

I have tried every form of birth control I can, from pills to IUDs and they all have a huge impact on my anxiety levels so I cannot take them. I have told him I don't want more children.

I agree, this is a actually a bigger, worrying point but it sort of slots in with his inability to DO anything."
"/u/simplethr00waway - this is good advice, but it might be worth doing this by getting a drug store pregnancy test and asking her to use it, rather than making it about going to a doctor.

Then instead of bugging her about it, just leave the test out and hope for the best."
"She cheated on you. Things won't be the same for you now. You will never trust her again. Even if she didn't, she's sharing explicit texts with someone else. That's break up material for me."
"&gt; so my girlfriend of 4 years cheated on me a little over a month ago

Buddy, it's going to take a lot longer than a month to get over this. If you're invested in this relationship, it's going to take time and effort, and communication from both of you to get over this. "
"Yeah, I agree that explaining to an adult will help at the school. As painful as it may be to bring up, they'll have your backs throughout it and squash any rumors they hear."
Amen to that! My mother is an ER nurse and while I totally let her control my care in an ER (like when your sick why do it yourself if you don't have to) she only observers and gives opinions. Otherwise shes hands off besides normal family assistance.
What redeeming qualities could possibly be keeping you with this guy? Seriously? 
"&gt; I think it's in bad taste to reject something that your love picks out just for you.

She didn't reject it, she accepted it and his proposal.  Also, he didn't pick it out ""just for her"", he literally just bought the cheapest gold ring he could find.  There was no thought put into it.

&gt; He could have always upgraded her later 

Why would he upgrade later when he can easily afford a nicer ring now?"
"I grew up in the MW and had ""sex-ed"" in 4th, 8th, and 10th grade.

They taught a lot about puberty, anatomy, and the mechanics of STDs and pregnancy, but they didn't talk much about the actual act of sex, beyond advising us to wait for marriage. They brought in a nurse once for about 30 minutes to talk about contraception, but that was also from a perspective of, ""Don't have sex. But if you decide to do it anyway, tell your parents. If you aren't mature enough to tell your parents, then you aren't mature enough for sex. Your parents can bring you to a doctor so you can get contraception.""

Probably the most important thing that was skipped, though, was a discussion on consent, healthy relationships, and what to do if someone is being harassed or assaulted.

Hopefully it's changed in the last 10-20 years. I worked in a college health center somewhat recently and was not encouraged by the number of very basic misconceptions I had to correct. For a while, we had an epidemic of people trying to douche with Diet Coke to prevent pregnancy."
and a bad financial organizational system (one that both parties don't agree on) can defeat any relationship
"it's so rude he calls their sex life boring (to her face).

"Because when men do this - the whole back door gambit of 'being friends' to fuck women? They don't see women as human beings, so anything out of a woman's mouth is already going to be ignored by him. He's only going to hear it from other men and even then he has a long road to understanding women are more than living Fleshlights (which is how he's treating them right now) "
Just walk away. Block him and don't respond. He knows what he did.
Your reasons to be creeped out are valid. Don't ignore your gut
"Yes and I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs still creepy to just be friends with them back then and still a little weird now. And guess what at 25 I was grown up enough to not be interested in hanging with a bunch of people 5 years younger than me. 

Makes me wonder how many friends he has his own age. "
I would have left you there.
"Listen to the fact that your parents are supporting you in this. That parents of a college student are PUSHING you to take a break from studies and travel.

In the summer after my 3rd year, I booked a 3 month ticket abroad (instead of the 3 weeks my family assumed). My entire family gave me backlash for that. But it was the most important and influential time in my life.

I broke up with a toxic boyfriend about a month in, spent 2 months healing, and building my relationship with God  and returned so much stronger cuz of it.

"Right, this guy‚Äôs motives do not matter. He doesn‚Äôt have permission to run roughshod over the rules of class decorum because he thinks he is doing the right thing. If he wants to talk about hell and abortion, he can quit teaching public school and start hosting a radio show.

Am Christian, have no time for these yahoos."
"&gt;My grandma is a little difficult and she and my mother have never been on great terms

Tread carefully.  We don't know the facts, and neither do you.  

It is super, super common for a grandparent to be really horrible to their own child growing up, and all lovey-dovey fawning over the grandchild as though their prior behaviour never happened.  If your mom was estranged from your grandmother, there was probably a reason.  Do not make the mistake of assuming that your grandmother treated your mother the same way that she treats you.  "
"&gt; How do I talk to him without it coming off negative?

You don‚Äôt. It *should* come off as negative. It is negative behavior on his part that is causing negative feelings on yours. He‚Äôs a big boy. If he can‚Äôt handle you telling him that something he does hurts and embarrasses you, he‚Äôs not mature enough for a relationship. Instant disqualification. "
"Buy a strap-on and a harness.  Offer to tie up up and peg him until he cries. If he says no, he's not into that, laugh it off, but bring it again the next day, only more insistent and with a whip in your hand. 

Also, girl, what are you doing living with a 45 year old? This relationship does not sound very healthy. He's more than twice your age, does not respect your boundaries or listen to you when you say no, and seems unwilling to establish a healthy, open dialog with you about safe, sane BDSM.  Instead, it sounds like he got turned on by something and is using you for his own desires, without respect for you and your feelings.  Dump him."

At least I sincerely hope this is the case because I did that for basically my whole swimming career, as did a few other girls I knew. YMMV, but in my decades of swimming I‚Äôve never had an issue with that. It was certainly better than missing three to four days of practice a month over it. "

"A few short-term options to stop it from getting worse before you can do the divorce that I can think of real quick: 

* literally lock your credit cards in a safe, set up a *very* secure password and two-factor authentication, and download your credit card's mobile pay.  This will allow you to make your daily purchases, but without a physical card for her to steal. 

* call your internet provider and try to block as many of her common shopping websites as you can.  It might temporarily slow the leak if she can't access her favorite sites.  She'll still try to shop, of course, but it might slow her down enough for you to catch her 

* Use Amazon to set up auto-deliveries of essentials - diapers, formula, paper towels, toilet paper, etc.  There's a slight discount, you ensure the house gets the necessities, and can't be accused of withholding essentials from her/the baby.  

* Do the same thing with your local super markets Shop From Home / grocery delivery.  If the food gets delivered, she has slightly less of an excuse to get out of the house and into temptation.  And again, you also ensure the essentials are being met.  

* Literally give your wife no access to cash, debit, or credit.  If she needs to food shop, buy and give her a pre-paid grocery store gift card.  If the baby needs clothes, pre-paid Wal-mart gift card.  

* Secure your valuables; since she might start selling or pawning them

Yea, you're babying her, and it will look controlling as hell from the outside, so ignore what friends say.  But again, those are **temporary** measures while you go see a divorce lawyer.  "
"I second this. It sounds harsh but what OP is longing for is never going to happen because he doesn't want it to happen. OP, you can change your own mind, attitudes and thoughts but you have to realise you have no control over his. He's making it very clear to you what his thoughts are. I know it's hard but go no contact and move on with your life, you're delaying the inevitable by trying to rebuild the relationship. Take this as a hard lesson learnt. "

"Thanks, I think this is what I'm more trying to convey. I obviously want to put my foot down about bigotry (I think I wasn't clear enough about that in my OP), but my husband wants to squash everything that isn't perfectly aligned with his cultural upbringing.

And I feel like...well, obviously, but what harm does it do? There's lots of little examples like that. I feel like he's throwing the baby out with the cultural bathwater, if you'll excuse the pun. 

I guess I'm not sure how to get my husband to ""We love abuela, but some of the things she believes are wrong."" I think he thinks if they don't do a 100% about face, then it's impossible. I think there is more gray area."
"I gotta say, the age gap is weird to me. I‚Äôm 29 and my fianc√© is 28 and we were just talking the other day about how people in their early 20s are basically children to us now. Your a baby.

Neither of us could imagine dating anyone so young.

  Which is why I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs gone wrong in this woman‚Äôs life that she‚Äôs not only dating someone way to young for her, but also behaving like a 14 year old girl with her first boyfriend.

It is NOT normal to need your partners attention 24 hours a day.

The texting every hour is NOT normal.

The inability to keep her hands off you, even affectionately, is NOT normal.

Throwing her friends away is NOT normal.

Not respecting your work hours and needing constant reassurance of your affection is NOT normal and will absolutely spiral into controlling jealousy.

This is obsessive behavior. It‚Äôs important we say obsessive and not clingy. Clingy is an annoyance. Clingy can even be kinda cute. The term minimizes what‚Äôs actually going on, which is full on obsessive behavior, which is not healthy for either of you and could turn extremely toxic and even dangerous.

  If she were closer to your own age, I would tell you to lay out the bullet points of what‚Äôs wrong, like you did here with her and set up some boundaries and see how it goes. But this woman is way to old to be behaving like this. She has the experience to know better. Which means something is wrong with her, either emotionally or mentally, that an inexperienced lover like yourself just isn‚Äôt going to have the tools to tackle. She will groom you into doubting yourself and doing things her way before you ever help her fix her issues, leaving you lost in an emotionally manipulative and damaging relationship that you won‚Äôt even be able to get an idea of how bad it is, because you won‚Äôt have anything to compare it to.

You should break up with her before it gets any deeper. If she threatens self harm, call the police. They‚Äôll get her the help she needs. Giving a person like that what they want is only hurting them AND yourself."
"You didn't do anything wrong, John is a tool. He blames you for being sexually assaulted, but more than that, he thinks that you can never enter a hot tub or pool again for the rest of your life because you were sexually assaulted in one. 

He is *insane*."
"Open a new bank account that he doesn't have access to. Do you have at least a part time job or is all your money coming from him? 


Did you take out loans or is he paying your tuition?


Go to the registrar or whatever office and make sure that they tell him that they can't give him that information and tell them to make a note not to give that info to anyone over the phone because it's confidential.


Tell him that it's unrealistic that you talk on the phone 2x a day because you have class and HW and school activities. Does he text? Could it be a compromise to just check in with a quick text daily?

You say you are ""all alone"" but what does that mean? Have you not made friends/connections in the year and a half you've been in school? Have you expressed this to your dad? Or do you just mean without family?

Is he ""all alone""? Did you live with just your dad, or are you the youngest of siblings and your dad is feeling ""empty nest syndrome""? 


What was your relationship like before college? Did he let you go out? What about summer/winter breaks in college?"
"Your question focuses a lot on his weight and size, but to me the more concerning thing is:

1) He took your car without asking
2) He didn't own up to damaging it
3) You parents gave him thekey without telling you.

Even if your brother was thin, those things would be a problem.

You can say to your parents ""I didn't think I needed to state this, but I just wanted me to make it clear. I gave you my car key for emergencies only, and I don't want you to lend it to anyone without asking me first. Can you do that?"" It might also be worth seeing if there's someone else you could give the key to."

"This is me. Currently very happily pregnant (and terrified!) with my first at 34. If you had asked me ten years ago if I wanted kids I would have laughed in your face and said hell no. Then I thought maybe if my future SO wants one, I will. Then I met my now-husband and I can‚Äôt wait to have kids with him. But, I have two very good friends who never wanted kids, and they got sterilized after 30 and are very happy with it. 

I considered sterilization, now I‚Äôm glad I waited and just had IUDs. They treated me very well. Plus, no periods!!!! "
Are either of you close with your parents? I think reaching out to them would be fair to see if you could learn more about whats going on.
"Can confirm. Drove my uncles miata in CA once, loved it. Stick shift, had a shitty grin when I got home. Such a fun car!"
"You've said everything I was going to say but better.

This was a big reason behind my sexual behaviour when I was younger. My first relationship was sexually abusive (and I come from a physically and emotionally abusive family) and I wanted to reclaim my sexuality by being the one to say yes all the time and feel like I was in control.

Also I really really wanted to be held and touched and coming from a very undemonstrative family the only way I knew to get any form of touch was sexually. It's much easier to get a man to fuck you ironically than ask a friend or someone to hold you.

And to confuse things further I also really love sex and wasn't looking to settle down so I had this outlet where I could be flirtatious and fun and have a man's attention where I could laugh and be playful when the rest of my life was trauma and misery and depression. 

It was an outlet like going out and getting drunk to let off steam and there was an element of using something else people enjoy dangerously like binge fucking as self harm.

I get that most people can't relate to that and I know it isn't everyone's coping strategy but I notice people put a lot more 'moral' judgement on my sleeping around than my eating disorder which was born out of similar thinking. 

I think it's important the OP separates any 'moral' thinking about this from any 'emotional' thinking. It's ok to not feel ready or able to deal with someone with a history of trauma but not to shame them or make them feel like damaged goods. 

For me opening up to my partner about my trauma and coping strategies for it was a huge stage of healing which I combined with going to therapy. I have zero urge to sleep with anyone else, no interest in cheating and having my partner accept that I'm flawed but that's human and loveable helped me love myself and really sort my shit out.

OP: whatever you decide do it soon and stick to it. Don't say you are ok with it if you aren't and then break up. And don't let yourself become her only support and become codependent. That doesn't help anyone.

Wait what? After only a year and six months she is absolutely NOT required to change her car to suit HIS children! That‚Äôs outrageous.
"I have a friend with 2 kids, in her 30s, and was told do not have more kids because she WILL die on the table, and they STILL won‚Äôt snip her. It‚Äôs insane! She heard ‚Äúwell medical miracles!‚Äù And ‚Äúscience is coming a long way maybe in a few years it‚Äôll be possible!‚Äù"

"Yep, you sound like a kick-ass auntie, OP!

Your sister sounds massively stressed and isn't thinking clearly. 

In my opinion, co-opting her motherhood would be questioning/overriding her parenting decisions, among other things... "
"Yeah, kids love the ""fun aunt/uncle"" - that's super common. 

I understand OP's sister is going through something, but she should've really thought before sending that email - OP isn't co-opting motherhood - she's being an extremely loving and generous aunt. 

I mean, she's given them so much, and instead of focusing on how great if an aunt she's been - what great support - she's mad she got stuck going to Disneyland with the kids instead of a tropical getaway with the childfree couples. She's clearly salty.

I think if it were me, I'd let it sit for a bit - OP's sister was embarrassingly nasty, and poking the badger won't do much. I'd wait until she's had time to cool off, and approach her when emotions aren't running so high. It also is not going to actually help anything for her to say ""how can you act like this when I've done so much?"" 

I agree with you completely - the kids probably made one too many comments about OP being the fun aunt, and now their mom is punishing them, and OP.

I hope her sister gets over her anger, and sees how lucky she's really been. "
"If my SO cracked such a cruel joke about my past suicide attempt, I'd be out of this relationship in a heartbeat.  3 years and a kid together, but something like that I could never feel loved or respected by her again.  It's difficult enough finding confidence and self-respect again after an attempt, but to be smacked down so hard by someone you love is just all kinds of psychological fuckery.  No relationship is worth reliving your own personal hell."

"At best, they need to be more careful. But no, they don't owe you an explanation of their sex lives.

Once you start dating and having sex, you'll understand how invasive those kinds of questions are."
"Then you are willing to have your child to be influenced by these people. For you it‚Äôs acceptable for your child to hear certain racist comments because ‚ÄúViva Venezuela‚Äù and it‚Äôs not 100% of the time,  so it‚Äôs ok.

When in the south in the US there were white water fountains and black water fountains. This went on for years and years and years more than 100 years after slavery had ended. Good people just like you ignored the fact that black people could not drink out of the same water fountain because it was a cultural norm. 

Only because those brave enough to stop ignoring the issue to finally force the laws to change. What it took was good people saying ‚Äúwe no longer find this acceptable and we‚Äôre not going to allow it to happen anymore‚Äù.

You would find out if you just had courage,  that nobody in your family would say one racist thing in front of you if they understood  that every time it happened your pick up your children walk out the door. I guarantee their conduct would change in front of you because they‚Äôre going to want to have a relationship with you and deep down they know  their behavior is wrong.  

Your child should experience zero racism while there with your family. 

If for you, 50% or 30% is OK for her to hear racist bigoted conversations,  then what does that say about you?
"
Stay out of it. Comfort your mom. This is not something that is on you to fix. 
"I think the mom thing is just an excuse. 

There was no blood. Yet he's convinced her to disbelieve what she saw with her own eyes. He has flat out told her that they're not together and won't meet socialize with her outside of cheap hotel rooms and the occasional dinner and movie ""date."" He's figured out a way to get laid for a fraction of the cost of a hooker"
"May be the best route. She is most likely emotionally overwhelmed with going back to work and missing the kids, and the whole trip might have gotten her upset and or jealous. "
"Or he strips and gets hard behind a screen, comes out and poses, then occasionally dips behind a screen to fluff himself up. There's no legit reason for your boyfriend to be actively masturbating during the painting session. "
"I want to add something tangentially related. As someone whose adopted I sometimes have to explain this when people are curious as to why I'm not particularly interested in meeting my ""real parents"". I say your real parents are the people who put you when you were a shitty teenager, the people who took care of you when you were sick and helpless, who made sure you had a place to put your head and someone to be there for you when you needed them most. Your real parents may or may not share any of your DNA, hell for some people they were just close friends of the family who were more stable than the people who gave birth to you.

To the OP I would say it sounds like you've been with your dad for most of your life. If he hasn't treated you badly before then there's probably a reason why he doesn't want you around your mother. It might not be a 100% selfless reason but if he's been good to you in every other instance why do you think he would be bad to you in this one? I'll also tell you that I've known a lot of shitty people with kids. They'll tell their kid they love them and say the kid is the most important thing in the world. They'll wail and cry when their kids get taken away. But the they'll lock their kids in their rooms and ignore them because they want to party with their friends. They feel like how much they love their kids is represented by how badly they feel when they can't give their kids something. But really loving your kids is represented by how much you'll do to make sure you can give your kids something; and by this metric every one of the shitty parents I've ever met fail. They feel bad that they can't do something for their kids, but they never do what's required even if it's just mildly inconvenient.

Honestly you're a 15 year old girl, you're in all likelihood a huge pain in the ass to deal with right now. You might think you're father is being hard on you for keeping you away from your mother, but it'd be much easier to just let you go live with them and be their problem. But he probably thinks it wouldn't be good for you (and if your mother had a drug addiction and prostitution charges, he's likely right)."
If that's what you want then do it! No one will care about this 6 months from now! 
"I'm sitting here with my jaw dropped. He's truly truly shitty and useless.

It would serve him right if you texted him a close-up of an oozing, bruised incision.

Look, it's easy to be a good partner when times are easy*. It's when things get hard that we really see someone's true nature. And things do get hard in life - it's inevitable.

You've now seen that you're dating an immature, unsupportive skunk who won't even get up off his couch to see you after a pretty major surgery. He wants the rewards of the surgery (pm me yr new tits) but he has the absolute fuckin' audacity to say, ""he shouldn‚Äôt have to feel obligated help [you] feel better anyway because [you] chose to do this to [yourself].""

The fuckin' audacity! Honestly, this guy is worthless and he will not be there for you for any of the difficult things that adult life brings. Take you fab new breasts and have fun without him.

*Sadly, we do see from this board that many people aren't even capable of being a good partner when things are easy. They also should be dumped."
"I felt the exact same way that you did at 23. But I‚Äôm really glad I decided not go go through with sterilization because I changed my mind around age 30, and now at 35 am married and grateful to be pregnant with my first child. I think the reactions you are getting are because you are so young and people often change their minds as I did.  If in 10 years you still feel the same then go for it then, but be cautious about making a permanent decision when you still don‚Äôt know what path your life is going to take."

She's being your wife of 10 years. Put your big boy pants and just sit her down now and tell her it's over. Contact individual lawyers and be done with it."

I think you're just under the impression that every man is equally as slow to learn and take responsibility as you are. 
"It's not that this other guy is better than you, OP, it's that your now ex was a shitty GF. Yeah, that guy's an asshole for hitting on the new girl in the office, especially if he knew that she had a BF, but your GF (if she truly loved and respected you) should have shut him down hard. She didn't and seems to have enjoyed the attention whether it was from him or some other guy. Given this and her reaction to the break up, I'd be willing to bet that this isn't the first time that something like this has happened. It's just the first time she got caught. It's not a reflection on you at all, OP, it just shows that your ex-GF is a shitty person. 

Edit: added a few thoughts"
"Genuinely horrified that so many people on this thread think cheating is objectively worse than grooming and abuse. 

Aside from that, given what you said, it seemed like her ex gave her no possible way for her to communicate her issues. Abusive relationships, especially one where a young woman is preyed on by an older men, are full of captivity and fear. They make you hate yourself, believe you are a bad person and that's why all these bad things are happening to you. And if you're already feeling that worthless it becomes horrifyingly easy to do things that you would, in a normal healthy situation, never do. She could have done what she did for a number of reasons - but none of them apply to your relationship because you will (presumably) not abuse her.

"
"I think as long as everyone has established how the bill is being split beforehand, and told to the waiter immediately, it is fine.

Something I used to do in college was to eat before the meal, and have it be known that I am just there to hang out. I always brought cash to cover the birthday person‚Äôs drink and meal, but that allowed me to hang out with friends while not having to worry about splitting the meals.

With all that in mind, this post hits a bit of a nerve for me, because I have been on the other side of the conversation in which someone orders an $18.99 dish and throws down a $20, as if tax and tip are an alien concept. Even worse, I have been to multiple meals where people act amazed after the bill comes and say ‚Äú$50 a person, I didn‚Äôt realize that foods don‚Äôt drinks would be that expensive, sorry I only brought $13 and some pocket lint.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think the OP falls into those above categories per se, but it is something to be aware of. If money is really tight, you can always go out to the restaurant and just hang out with friends, eating beforehand. The same also applies to the bar: it is cool to hang out without having a drink.

"The stripper probably hasn't deleted the messages on her end so OP could get the real truth that way (although it sounds like she doesn't really want it...). 

If she really was extorting the husband, he should have no issue handing over the number as she's lost her leverage anyway. If it was a physical affair with the money given willingly, he will make it supremely difficult for OP to contact her."
"You can't live your life for your family. It's like staying in a broken marriage, at this point. It might forestall some of the hurt, but you'll never really be happy. 

And like going through a painful breakup, it's going to take time to rebuild. The good news is that you picked the perfect time. Going to university next year, with a bunch of other young people who are all in a new place looking to make new friends -- that's the best opportunity you could ask for. 

Build the life you want to live, one that you can be proud of. Then you can either choose to invite your family into that life or not, but if they decline it will be their loss, not yours. 

Half of my family is from a similarly strict religious group, and it has sometimes been a struggle to maintain a close relationship with them as well, but at this point I feel like that's on them. "
"So she was already feeling scared, so you decided to scare the crap out of her...And then tell her she ""wasn't that scared""? You sound like a total immature ass. Do her a favor and don't contact her again. I had to look at the age to make sure you weren't a teenager."

Even if the construction is set to take two years, he should stay on the jobsite 24/7 working until either the building is finished or he dies.

"&gt;  and stop doing things for him if he still won't change.

so if he won't change you'll...stay with him but do less things for him?

this is going to get so much worse."
made me giggle thinking of the old Jenny thread here ;)
"Then it's time to push back.

Won't let you use the TV? Fine, no speakers. Just set up another TV. Who cares?

I can tell that your BF and friend are meek and think this is just a small price to pay to avoid conflict. But instead you guys are just walking around on egg shells, being ok with living with a shitty person.

Gotta put your foot down sometime. If they won't join you, I would suggest confronting him in front of them. Maybe that's a shitty move but it might force them into having to join the united front."
"Well, can you accept that he intended it that way? Fighting over the language is going to get in the way of both of you effectively expressing your feelings. Makeplans to struck to in person communication from now on, and don't get hung up on wording that has been clarified."

"Yup, I wholly agree with this. Definitely apply for the position. 

It sounds like he's bitter by being passed over (I mean, who wouldn't) but he's being unrealistic in his actions (not applying for it, seems like he's expecting them to hand it over to him). It wouldn't surprise me that he's been bitter to the others who had the manager position and I would expect him to be somewhat bitter to you.

Honestly, jobs aren't handed out. If you're not proactive in getting the position you want, others who are will get it over you. From upper management's perspective, he's someone who is bitter, doesn't appear to want to be there, but does great work. If they just give a promotion to him without him fighting for it, then what does that say to those who are enthusiastic about staying in the company? It's a bad feedback loop for him that he needs to change for his own mental health, IMO."
"You‚Äôre still the scapegoat, and they‚Äôve engineered this situation to make sure this is somehow your fault, not hers. This is obvious because there‚Äôs really no other reason for her to ask you before dear daddy. It‚Äôs quite genius, really, in a shitty manipulative way...

‚Äì If you say yes, then she doesn‚Äôt have to ask your dad. 

‚Äì But if you say no and she does have to ask Dad, she can cry to daddy about how mean and selfish big sister is. See? She‚Äôs not the problem, it‚Äôs not her poor decisions or his parenting. It‚Äôs you, it‚Äôs always you, just like it‚Äôs always been. 

It allows them to avoid confronting the reality that she‚Äôs not the perfect angel he decided she was. That is very uncomfortable for both of them, and they will desperately latch on to any way of avoiding it. 

Bonus‚Äì She knows that he‚Äôll come down on you for saying no, and perhaps next time she asks you‚Äôll give in to avoid more negative contact with him. You hated that treatment so much you cut contact, so she‚Äôs taking advantage of the fact that you wanted a relationship with her so much that you resumed contact with him. 

You might just have to cut or severely limit contact again and give it another shot in a few years. Without you around to blame everything on and a baby to force a heavy dose of reality and growing the fuck up, perhaps your sister will see the situation a bit more clearly then and you can have a relationship with her sans the poisoning influence of your dad.

I was able to have a good relationship with my sisters  (middle one being the golden child) once they got into their mid 20s. Before that, the dynamic was just too similar to when we were kids to avoid the familiar shitty patterns."
wow really?? you do exactly what your roomate told you not to do and YOU feel bad about it? come on. 
i think one of the guys was getting off on it 
"Honestly, I‚Äôd be extreme annoyed as well if I had an small child at my house 6x a week. It‚Äôs normal imo, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it at all. Are you expected to help look after him?"
"It's not unreasonable to want commitment before you start caring for an animal. She doesn't want to love and care for something that could easily be ripped out of her life, how is that not understandable? Also you implied that she wants to marry you because of your money and not because she's already waited four years for a commitment. That's icky of you."
I think if she saw it as condescending she would escalate instead of becoming calmer. I definitely see why you feel it is a problem but that problem doesn't really exist if she doesn't see it that way. From the way you described her behavior I would bet that if she was offended you would be getting a completely different reaction.
Good idea then you can add more fish! 
My Starbucks app literally does both of those things. 
"You probably recognize this, but one Saturday every 2 weeks is not nearly enough time to maintain a close father-son bond, especially when your son is still trying to understand his feelings about the situation.

Do you make any effort to be in contact with him during the week? Facetime/Skype in the evenings? Emails that his mother can read to him? I'm not sure whether that sort of contact would work based on your custody arrangement, but if it does then you should be making every effort to maintain it.

Continue being kind to him and doing what you can to mend your relationship when you do see him, but if it's possible, also try to make an effort during the time when you can't physically be with him."
"You are not going to be a greater priority than his mother.

If that's a deal-breaker, leave.  You have the information, now use it to make a decision.  There's not really much you can do here."
"Do you think that your depression is making you think these things about yourself?

Or am I now talking to the OP's husband?"
"She‚Äôs right.   You really don‚Äôt get it at all.   It will slow down as the baby gets older.  But all new moms do this.   All.   You need to take a step back and realize that this is a very finite time.  She‚Äôs going through a lot of changes,  it‚Äôs time to be a team player here.  "
Yeah I was saying unless she‚Äôs like top 1% in college then she‚Äôs not going pro.
OP is allowed to refuse to not see the woman his dad cheated with. A lot of the world would be doing the exact same thing... 
"First of all, you‚Äôre not mentally healthy enough to have a relationship with this guy, even if he returns your feelings ‚Äî which he doesn‚Äôt seem to at all. I don‚Äôt think confessing to him will solve your problem and I would highly discourage you from doing so. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to handle a rejection and he‚Äôs also your coworker so obviously unless you quit your job you‚Äôre still going to see him everyday. 

Please get yourself into therapy. This is not healthy and it‚Äôs not cute. You‚Äôre becoming irrationally jealous, your grades are slipping, and personally I would feel **beyond**  creeped out if I found out one of my coworkers was going home and masturbating about me for **months**. He‚Äôs a human being, not your personal spank bank. 

You need to treat this like an addiction.  The first step is admitting you have a problem ‚Äî which you‚Äôve done and that‚Äôs a very good first step. The next step is getting help.  You need to stop fantasizing about him and learn how to re- train your thoughts so you aren‚Äôt living in dream land all day. A therapist can absolutely help you with this. 

It‚Äôs not as hard as you think. Once you start breaking those mental habits it gets a lot easier. In the meantime keep your interactions as brief and professional as possible. 

EDIT: I just saw the post you made 3 months ago under another username. He‚Äôs 17. If this isn‚Äôt a troll post, you are a predator and you need to leave this guy alone. You‚Äôve been messing with him since he was 16 years old. Stay the fuck away from him."
"Lol, this comment made me laugh. It seems like this really may be the case though, good luck OP."
"I just feel so shocked and caught off-guard, like she's not a shit-talker and a really good/loyal friend so I can't believe she harbors such resentment towards me? I think your last question is right, I just don't know how I can go back to talking to her in that same way. Like I thought about trying to like ""casually"" bring up the things she mentioned to ""set the record straight"" but I shouldn't have to do that, should I?"
I completely agree! This is how progress is made. Hard conversations with people we care about.
"For one, asexuality is a thing. So is being aromantic. I'm 39 and a virgin. I have zero interest in dating. 

More generally, happiness means different things to different people. I love critters and wouldn't be happy without pets in my life. It would be pretty silly of me to insist that EVERYONE needs pets around to be happy, wouldn't it? Happiness to me is in my cats, my books, my games, long solo walks on an autumn day, comfy naps...your version of happiness might not include any of those things. My version of happiness absolutely does not include sex or a busy social life. Indeed, those things would make me pretty darn miserable. So who gets to decide if I'm happy...me, or you?"
You don‚Äôt have to be super emotional and expressive to not make your partner feel like hot garbage.

"....a lot of people? You need a flu shot every year because it‚Äôs not the same exact vaccine, it‚Äôs based on what influenza strains are predicted to be most problematic and influenza is a rapidly mutating virus. "
"You shouldn‚Äôt let her live rent free in your house. 

But the reasons you are giving? Her disloyalty or something? Those reasons are just mean.

Even if she wasn‚Äôt somehow disloyal, it would be a mistake to let ANYONE live rent-free in your investment home. I agree with others that what‚Äôs really going on here is your parents want to pawn their problem off on someone else.

Instead of harping on this disloyalty, put it to your parents this way. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre asking me to let her live here for a year, that‚Äôs like giving her a $20,000 cash gift. I‚Äôm not doing that.  How about the both of us chip in to help her pay for a much smaller apartment? After she files for spousal support and section 8 housing, we‚Äôll see what she really needs!‚Äù"
"No, you're not overreacting because there's a history and a pattern here. The brother is a lazy, deadbeat, user.  It won't be only for a month and we all know it. Even your GF knows that is a distinct possibility because she said his stay might be extended by ""a week or two"".  Ha!  You'll be extremely lucky if it's ONLY that long.  She's basically telling you her brother will be staying for however long he and she wants, not you. This is a huge red flag. Her lack of respect for you and your relationship is not a good sign.  The whole ""family first"" thing is manipulation. 

There's a difference between 'helping' and 'enabling'.  The parents obviously came to that realization finally so they stopped ENABLING him. And good for them. Your GF is na√Øve if she thinks it will be different and that she will be ""helping"" a family member. She'll be taking on the role of enabler.  Even if her brother does have valid mental issues, neither she nor you are equipped to deal with that. He should get professional help although I'm suspicious that the ""mental issues"" is an excuse used to justify his dysfunction. 

Your apartment is way too small for anyone to stay there more than a weekend. Your apartment is your home, your sanctuary.  It won't feel like that after he turns your living room into his bedroom, your bathroom now has 3 people using it, your dog has to cower in a corner away from him, and her brother is there whenever you're home and you just want your privacy, space and freedom.

No, I don't think it's an overreaction to move out.  And take the dog with you for his safety."

"it sounds like this c person is the one her father was cheating with. 

to the op bc of that, she might always be the mistress. that's the chance people take when they are deceitful. "
"Aww dude. It's okay!

I blurted out ""I love you"" on the third date with my SO, so I get how you feel. :D Just let it go, don't mention it to him."
I'm in university right now.
How does he have more right to this dog then he does? Cheating doesn't make her a bad dog ow we 
"You don't want to do this for the same reason surgeons don't routinely operate on their own family members.  Medical staff need to be 100% professionally focused, which is something you cannot do when your partner is the one giving birth to your child.

She's being irrational and you're not being selfish at all."
You came her to seek affirmation of what you already know: You need to dump him.
Same. I played from ages 4-9 and had a dad I didn't know scream at me from the benches demanding I get pulled for missing a catch. I was already shy and insecure and it really messed with my confidence. Ended up dropping baseball shortly after.
Maybe you should read it.
This turned out so good!!
"In my country you would be obligated by law to tell her. You definitely should anyway, she could infect others if she cheats. Or in worst case infect an innocent baby if she gets pregnant. "
"Instead of leaving it at ""my day was wonderful"", could you elaborate with ""Still working on X project, came up with a good solution to the problem we've been having in Y meeting,"" etc?

She's a gardener, she tells you about pruning bushes. She prunes bushes everyday, but she still shares that with you. It sounds like she wants the same reciprocation and ability to at least vaguely understand your job and what you do all day. 

My fianc√© works in a field that I don't necessarily understand, but he still gives me highlights and details of his day. I feel as though it is bonding to do so, because it allows me to either ask ""Hey, what ever happened with that project?"" or if he had a bad day, it allows him to vent without having to fully explain a foreign subject matter to me.

Edit: I want to add a response regarding the 'What are you thinking?"" question. An ex of mine asked me that a lot, and I felt very put on the spot. At the time, I was struggling with managing my depression and I spent a lot of time actively trying to quiet my brain. I tried to explain this to him, that if he wanted to engage in a conversation to prompt me with topics, but otherwise my answer would likely be ""I'm focusing on being present in this moment."""
It'd be easier to admit he slept with Molly.
"I agree with this. Blackmailing someone who is sick is the lowest of the low.

First make sure there is no proof of your relationship, clean up your phone and computer, etc.

Then, you need some ammunition. For example you can get into her phone and her computer. Try to find out if she smokes weed, stuff like that. You can always preemptively lie and accuse your sister of having a girlfriend..."
If you officially separate and then divorce there is a good chance that he will have to pay you alimony or support.  This is why you need to talk to a lawyer. 
"I don't trust people who are okay with no condom sex while not in a monogamous relationship. If they do it with you, they do it with others. I would go get tested either way. Really just use condoms! Yes it feels less good but anything better than being diseased.  "
"I completely agree she needs time for herself. This week, I'm taking care of an autistic 21 year old while his parents are on their annual vacation to Mexico. They go every year because the NEED to get away from their responsibilities for a while or they just can't cope. "
I don't see what that has to do with his comment. He literally just stated facts given by OP.
