"She shouldn’t confront the sister. This is between her and her boyfriend to deal with and discuss as a couple. At the end it’s his decision to make to go among with the sister’s suggestion or not. Tomorrow morning she should signal to her boyfriend she’d like to have a private conversation, they can go for a walk or out for breakfast just the two of them and she can talk to him about what she overheard. Or she can wait till he come to bed and they can talk then."
"Your mindset seems to be obsessive and desperate. Forget about this girl and start working on yourself. Maybe reading a book about it is not such a bad idea.

Also, stop trying to pick up girls from work, don't look up girls' social media before you get to know them, don't do drugs with your colleagues, don't have more than 1-2 drinks at office parties and don't obsess so goddamn much over your social performance (that includes writing 1000 word reports about them)."
"Did you write this while high? Because no offence, but based on the way your post reads, I wouldn’t want to be friends with you either. You jump around from point to point, and you seem entirely self-involved. I don’t see how the cars you own/have fixed has ANYTHING to do with your popularity status.

Playing on your phone in gym class is just asking to get beaned in the head, and that’s not even just for bullied kids. In my school that tended to happen no matter who was texting, even the quarterback.

Oh, and yeah, weed makes teens (anyone, really, but I digress) horribly boring to be around. Y’all think it makes you so cool, but to everyone who doesn’t smoke you kinda just look like a loser. And by even considering dropping out, you’re perpetuating that stereotype. In high school, I tended to not want to hang out with the kids who were like you. I wanted to be around people who were clearly going places in life, because those were the people that I had things in common with.

Btw, what kind of 15 year old calls weed “cannibis”?"
So I am assuming he has the access to the trust because he is one of the executors. If he is spending the money from the trust on himself then what he is doing could be considered illegal. Please contact his father and a lawyer. This money is supposed to be your child's. Time to go mama bear.
"As you say, thus is about respecting your parenting with *your* child. The way we enforce boundaries is by not tolerating unacceptable behavior. You can't control how he acts but you don't have to tolerate him being harmful to your child. Tell him that your child follows *your* rules and he may not impose his. He especially may not impose his by yelling at you or your child. And here is the important part, when he inevitably does try to impose his insane rules through yelling them, *you leave*. Leave the table, leave the room, leave the house of necessary. These are your boundaries, he can respect them and have a relationship with you, or he can not have a relationship with you. Those should be his only two options."
"I (24 year old man) watched sound of music today (already seen it like 30 times) and started sobbing when Maria got married - trust me your reason is not even close to making the ""Crying for embarrassing reasons list"" :) "
IT PUTS THE LOTION ON ITS SKIN OR ELSE IT GETS THE HOSE AGAIN
"OP, you love this girl, right? You want her to be happy? Then tell her very clearly that if she marries this other guy, she will never see you or hear from you again.

- If she truly loves you and wants you, then she needs to know for sure that she will lose you if she marries someone else. Only then will she have the courage to stand up to her family.
- If she does marry the other guy, then staying in touch with you could cause her lifelong sorrow, and you love her too much to cause her sorrow.
"
"It sounds like he has been obsessed with you for years and she either suspected it or found proof of it in the past.  You are a reminder of his obsession, and on some irrational level she might blame you. Of course none of this is your fault.  In time she will calm down and realize she married a sleazeball."
"Exactly. He isn’t nice, he just gets off on *seeming* nice. That’s how he pleases himself.

Because a nice person would want to do what made his GF happy. Here the BF is telling her off for not letting him do what he wants, and is ignoring her when she tells him he is making her uncomfortable.

These “gifts” aren’t about you, they’re about him. He isn’t nice, he’s self-centered. "
"Especially as she cheated while you provided a very good life for her, and she chose to be SAHM, you are in the right here. 
No one will fault you for wanting a divorce from a woman who tried to cure boredom with another's mans dick "
He's f-ing 27 dang years old he can darn well wash his own dishes. Wtf. Don't deal with this childish attitude.
"Exactly so! Great guy + noodle spine + horrible in-laws = Life of misery for OP. I hope she visits r/justnomil and the other JustNo subs, because she really needs to see the kinds of things that could easily happen if she and her FH don't set/enforce firm boundaries. If her great guy is so ""kind and gentle"" that he's attending family events from which she's banned and can't manage to tell his family of origin to stop interfering with *his* wedding, then he is not marriage material at the moment. "
"&gt; In his hand was a ring he'd purchased . . . for his ex. He'd prematurely proposed to her, too.

Damn. It's not easy to deal with a partner who has the unfortunate tendency to shoot himself in the foot. But deal you must. Perhaps there's a future with him, but clearly it's much too early to know. To prevent this recurring, set a ban on proposals. While you might accept him, he's clearly not well equipped to judge these things. Give it a year. Two. Whatever. If you feel things move that way and in time can see it, lift that ban. But that's a ground rule which must stay in place if you even want to have any reasonable future with him."
"&gt;But I'm not crazy about her, partly because we've only been dating since December 7, but also because I just plain can't see myself falling in love with her.

Huh? WTF? Then WHY oh WHY did you make a commitment to be exclusive?

You started talking in late November of this year right? Then officially got together on Dec 7th??? 

Call me crazy... but I always casually dated people UNTIL I developed feelings and THEN we had the talk about being official IF they also had the feelz. 

I casually dated my now partner for like 5 months before we became boyfriend and girlfriend. 

I really just don't understand why you would go exclusive with someone you really don't even know???"
"This thread is so weird. I feel like there has to be some generational gap or something, half the people here seem to have no issue with this.

If this was me (either the SO, or parent-in-law, or whatever) I would just be so pissed: ""Seriously, you felt like you couldn't hold out one more second, and had to go pleasure yourself ? In the middle of the day ? In the middle of Game Time with the Family ?""

I'm almost scared to ask what might have ""triggered"" his little sexual-emergency."
How did he not do it with intent?  He told you he did it on purpose...
"Just FYI, his mom doing everything because ""it makes her feel good"" will not be easy for you if you guys ever live together. My dad said the same thing to my mom and it took years of her doing everything around the house before he finally figured out that it's his job, too. I remember them arguing about it when I was a kid. I mean he's generally a decent person otherwise but old habits die hard, and household chores can become a major point of contention. Please consider that, because mostly cleaning up after himself once in a while at your place doesn't mean he's going to pull his own weight in everyday life. 

Not saying to immediately break up or anything, but this is something you might want to at least have a conversation about."
"He explicitly stated they were randomly assigned to him, why are you creating false facts to support a completely unfounded opinion? "
"At no point in your example did you actually say to your wife ""I'll clean them up"" (whether that was cleaning them up then or saying you'd clean them up later). You could have said that in a number of different ways but it's like you purposely avoided saying that because you know it is what she wanted to hear. You sound awful. I wouldn't want to be around you either. "
"""Sister, we will not be taking you up on your offer of house sitting. I am concerned about your compulsive stealing behaviours and do not trust you around my posessions. I am sure you can understand why.""

She needs blunt honesty to see how her behaviour is affecting her relationships and you're one of the few who can offer that."
"I sometimes don't do well with physical contact.  Abusive relationships have left me jumpy.  The weather changes in new england tend to get me feeling blue.

I didn't have to work today, so last night I was up late playing WOW, after my fiance went to bed.

At around 3am I finally was tired enough, and as I lay next to him, him fast asleep, I just felt ""I really do love this man"".  So I laid sideways across the bed, my head resting in his lap.

He stirred a bit, a confused ""huh?"" then ""oh, hi"", and in his half sleep state put his hand on my shoulder, then fell asleep.  I followed soon.

After years in terrible situations, I can lay my head in his lap, and have him put his hand on my shoulder and we fall asleep together like that.

Which, for a long time, was more than I ever thought I'd have."
"I completely disagree with this. There are other things that you can give in a relationship, especially if you make different incomes. Time, support, help around the house, etc. A relationship doesn’t have to have people with the same income to be an equal partnership. "
"You did the right thing! 
 
A few things.

1.  Remember this feeling. This awful, gut-wrenching, horrified, angry, sad, despairing feeling. You hate it. You don't want to feel it again. And yet, being with him means feeling this way. Not all the time, but enough. This isn't love. This isn't how it's supposed to be. This is not a good relationship. When you start to think ""MAybe he's not all that bad..."" REMEMBER THIS FEELING. 
 
2.   Whenever you start to think ""But I love him..."" Remember this, EVERY woman who has been sent to the hospital with bruises and broken bones from an abusive partner says ""But I love him..."" Every person whose partner got caught cheating for the second, or fifth, or tenth time, says ""But I love her / him..."" LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH. Love is NOT the basis of a healthy relationship. RESPECT IS. So unless you can say the words ""But I respect him, and I know he respects me,"" then nothing else matters. Love is for Twilight bullshit and fairy princess stories for children. My friend is married to a woman who does not work, does not cook, does not clean, spends all of his money on weed and heroin, and beats him so regularly that he always has a new pair of glasses when I see him. Does that sound like a great marriage to you? Why does he stay with an abusive woman? ""Because I love her!"" He lost custody of HIS CHILDREN because he is ""in love"" with a woman who won't keep drugs out of the house. So please, do not fall for this ""I'm in love"" bullshit. Love only matters when you have a solid foundation of RESPECT, which is not the case here. 
 
3.   Use some affirmations, and look at this as an ACHIEVEMENT for yourself. Say things to yourself like ""I make healthy choices for myself, even when it's really hard."" ""I am learning to value myself."" ""I respect myself."" ""I deserve to be treated with kindness, and I am taking steps to ensure that I am."" ""I have hard work in front of me, and I know I am capable of doing it."" ""I respect myself enough to make sure I never go back to that unhealthy relationship.""  ""I might still love him, but I DON'T respect him, and I will NOT call someone I have no respect for."" ""I am hurting a lot today, and that's okay. I can read a book, see a movie, call a friend, organize my closet, play a game, write in my journal, or even plan a vacation for next year. What I am NOT going to do is call my ex. I am going to deal with this pain another way.""

4.   Remember that this will PASS. The pain will pass. It will all blow over. Not today, not this week. But it WILL pass. Millions and millions of us have been there, and we have felt the pain, and been in the thick of it, and it SUCKED, and we got through, and you will make it to the shore too, scarred and bruised but alive. And we welcome you to our ranks with open arms. And someday, you will read about a young woman with a real jerk of a boyfriend. And you will nod to yourself, and say ""Ooh, that sounds too familiar. I know just what she's going through."" And you'll reach out a hand, and hopefully, she'll take it. "
"My gut says you don’t want to move, it’s obvious to your wife and now you’re making up all these excuses and she’s calling your bluff. First it’s your job and possible promotion (which to be clear you don’t have and are not guaranteed to get) and then in the comments it’s your shoulder that’s the problem.  What’s next? A sick relative, a great deal on a house, wanting to have a baby, etc. etc.? You don’t want to move.  Own it.  Deal with it.  Don’t blame your wife for getting angry when you’ve mealy mouthed your way out of a deal you made with her. 
"
"Why can't he go out with his friends for the night without checking in with you? If he says he has plans for the night, it seems reasonable to let him go and have a good time with his friends and talk to/see him the next day. It's healthy for couples to hang out separately and not have contact for several hours. "
"I had to look at your age about 3 times. I was sure you’d be 16 every time. 

&gt;Anyway, I disregarded her past

Well how valiant of you! Because that’s something you should have to disregard or that people should be upset about? 

&gt;We talked about having kids together one day and she even wanted to get my name tattooed

You dated for less than a month, that kind of talk is way too fast. Like at least a year too soon for that kind of talk. 

&gt;I have realized that what makes me hard to move on is the fact that she slept with guys who she said she had no feelings for including the aforementioned colleague of mine, a colleague of hers as well as a FWB relationship with her ex (number 6) BUT not me.

Why do you feel entitled to sex? That’s a fucking gross attitude OP. She could have slept with every last man on the face of the planet and not owe you anything. 

&gt;She has rejected ANY of my propositions to meet up, hook up or even chat

Let’s call a spade a spade, she wants you to leave her the fuck alone and instead you’re begging her to pity fuck you while you shove your foot in the door with “chat” and “meet up.” Gross OP. You’re not old enough to be dating apparently, your worldview needs adjusting."
"It’s obvious the children (or at least one of the children) have noticed that the situation is hideously unfair too, so continuing to maintain the status quo will only confuse them and send them the wrong message about how partners should treat each other."
"A lot of people are getting suddenly ill from stomach flu right now. A friend of mine just now walked into her mother's house with all her family there, and started hurling. "
"I’m in a new relationship and this really bothers me. Not so much that my bf does it, but how obvious it is. Like whole head moving, following the person walking by! Or sits back and does the whole eyes up and down thing. THAT bothers me. Like, look all you want, but be a little discreet! It’s actually embarrassing. "
"Thanks for responding! Normally he's not this much of a douchebag, though maybe I never took those instances seriously since they didn't affect me as much. You're right, I really should lose the deadweight... "
"I think we have the same mother. Seriously, I can't figure out how to deal with it either. I try to be nice and I would definitely try to sort out the wifi and call her again if you can, though if she's like my mother, the phone call won't be enough. Good luck and hang in there - Merry Christmas! "
"Stop reading ""various communities online"" that are warping your views, if you haven't already. Also, maybe lay off the feminist online content for a while. Reading about what women are (rightfully) angry about isn't giving you a full picture of women as human beings with our own interests, quirks, and personalities. We're not a monolith. Instead, keep reading books by women. (See also: movies by women, tv shows by women, podcasts by women, games by women.) Don't just read feminist or educational books: read personal essays, literary fiction, short stories, urban fantasy, whatever you like. Read popular science by Mary Roach. Read comics by Marjorie Liu or Allison Bechdel. Read sci fi by Ann Leckie. Read about how Roxane Gay channeled her loneliness and angst into competitive Scrabble. (She's hilarious.) If getting to know women in real life feels scary, get to know women through their work. We do lots of things other than being pissed at men, I promise. "
"Haha yep, the free world where women have to plan their outfits so they don’t get accosted during their day. I laugh about it because it’s been a “thing” for as long as I can remember. "
"It’s a support group for people who have nasty MILs. It’s a place for people to vent about the nasty things their MILs have done. As for cutting contact, I agree people should do it, but that’s not always possible. "
"This. Be at peace, you are not responsible for her actions."
Then you really need to solve this issue with your wife because she’s absurdly blowing it out of the water. And you should recognize she’s entitled to her hobbies as well.
"This seems fairly normal. Most places I've worked have just called it a 'social club' or something similar. In places that haven't had it I end up paying way more than $5 a month on individual collections for birthdays/pregnancies/retirements etc. 

It's part of the social side of having a job, which is an important part of having a heathy workplace culture. someone has to pay for it, now that workplaces don't (they used to), and it's fairer to split it between staff than have the costs fall on the same couple of people every time, which is the alternative. 

I think she was probably exaggerating when she said 'harass' in her email, and you don't need to worry about actually being harassed. 

If you really don't want to take par then speak to her quietly and state you just can't afford it right now, and that you won't be attending birthdays etc that are part of the donation, and ask her to take your name off the list. I would expect you to develop as reputation as somewhat anti social/unfriendly though if you do. 

&gt;I don't understand the need for the parties to the extent that a required a payment out of everyone needed. In other places I've worked someone would bring in a box of donuts or make a giant goofy card for birthdays.

Other people were still paying for those donuts/cards etc. This is an attempt to make it more fair. "
"Please don't do this gift card idea, as a grown adult who as a child often got gift cards for Christmas while the other kids unwrapped presents, it's really no fun. And left me feeling like I didn t have Christmas. 

Also the gift cards sounded rather geared towards yourself (lunch with me). 

A third point (not meaning to be harsh). At 13 I knew VERY FEW kids who enjoyed spending time with their parents tbh. Especially kids from divorced households. They are just entering their teen ""I am cool and individualistic"" years.
"
"I struggled the worst with nausea right when I got up, and my doctor told me to eat a few saltines before I got out of bed. I hated the idea of eating crackers in bed (crumbs, kill me now) but the nausea won out and I tried it. Helped immensely!"
Please don't let your cousin bring a man she broke her marriage up over to your wedding. There might be shades of grey in how your fiabce handled it and how you did but the fact that your cousin would even try to bring him is such a slap in the face to what your wedding should mean to the two of you.
nope nope and nowhere. manage a relationship as much as you can with your mother and tell the other two to go pound sand.
I was 14 when I was watching my baby sister getting viciously beaten on the floor. At that moment I decided I would never lay a hand on my children. I started researching when I could legally leave my home. At 17 I packed all of my things in the night and had a friend pick me up. I went to live with my now husband. I am proud to have a healthy relationship and life that I can raise my babygirl in. 
"Not just that she didn't put the towels in the hamper, but why on earth would she need three whole towels to clean up? I ""get"" one to wash up and one to dry herself off but why do they all smell like pee? Unless she's really a horse it almost sounds like she wanted to dirty up as many things as possible. "
Is this guy on the autism spectrum?
"Please see the sidebar at JustNoMiL. Very wise words there.

It doesn't matter the motivation. The reality is your husband is putting others ahead of you, his family. His CHOSEN family. The one he made vows to.

"
"I'm guessing maybe she had an accident on the chair, tried to clean it with the towels and lied because she's embarrassed? 

I would just be honest with her and say ""Listen, after you left we discovered urine on my chair and on my towels. I'm not trying to shame you, but I'm pretty disturbed to be honest. If you had an accident I could understand that, but I'd expect you to be honest with me about it.""
"
"This certainly does sound like a nightmarish situation to deal with. As a host, be sure to remain aware of the needs of your other guests. Your sister isn't your priority right now, the rest of your family is. Make game night, movie night, or some group activities which will engage everyone in nice social situations. Everyone is there to spend time with each other, and as a host, facilitate that. 

Good luck!"
Arrogance. 
"Ugh, morning pee is concentrated and extra stinky."
"I volunteered at a rape crisis center for years; if you need to call one or RAINN it would absolutely be treated as a sexual assault (because it is!).  And what you're feeling is so very, very normal.  Many question; was it that bad?  Okay, it was bad, but was it *sexual assault*?  Was there something *I* did to make it my fault? How could someone so nice do this to me?  It takes time to process this.

"
"You can find people talking about it, but most often anonymously due to fear of being judged and shamed. Its three kinds of thing parents often don't mention to nonparents. Maybe consider posting in r/parenting or r/daddit?"
"You might seriously compromise your career, and theirs, by getting rid of them to appease your wife.  As it stands you are a unique leader in the company and that is valuable.

But, as already noted, said nothing about your home life or marriage, other than your wife complaining.  Perhaps the root of your wife's concerns are not that your staff are attractive young women, but that these women (through work) are your priority.

How much time do you spend on your relationship at home.  To make your wife feel special, loved, wanted, appreciated.  The fact that this has been such an ongoing issue, I wonder how much you've actually done to address it at home, or have you been increasingly dismissive of her concernes!?

You don't need to make changes at work first, you need to ensure you are adequately present at home and with your wife.  If things are way too intense, then setup a marriage counselling appointment with her so you two can get on the same page and sort out what the real issue is."
When there's red flags of predatory behavior (married young after 6 months with a significant age gap) I can see why they may be predisposed to that particular worry. 
"I saw the same counselor with several gf's (when we ran into issues).  His job was basically to help us think through things and resolve things and each time the relationship ended.  For me it was a learning experience and I gained something each time and began to see my own patterns.  Other people might have had different experiences with counselors, I guess it depend upon the counselor and what your agreements are with them."
"You’re 23 and have been dating someone for YEARS that is 46? He isn’t some Prince Charming, he is a predator. He does not have your best interests at heart, hence his disrespect of your decision in telling you that he’ll beg you to stay. He’s no treasure, he’s a troll."
Exactly lol. If you were apathetic to it then you wouldn’t care if you had to watch it or not!!
"I can understand not getting you anything for the baby because the baby is not actually *here* yet, but it's definitely super weird that she didn't buy you a single thing. Did their other children's SOs recueved gifts?"
"I would keep it to myself. Your mom was venting to her sister - a lot of that venting was about things she wouldn't want to tell you. She still wants a relationship with you and is seeing a therapist to work those things out on her own. I think she will, but you need to give her the time and space to do that. Don't butt in with info about a conversation you shouldn't have been eavesdropping on in the first place.

On your end. The most I would do is, probably sometime after the holidays, confess and apologize to your mom for keeping the affair a secret. (I wouldn't let on that I was apologizing because I had overheard her.) You were in a cruddy position there, and I think she could come to understand that. Your options were limited and I'm sure you didn't really know what the right thing to do was. Heck, I am not sure there is a 100% right thing to do with that knowledge. Ultimately, you didn't want to get involved and had hoped for your dad to do right. That's not an entirely unfair decision to make, in my mind. At least, I would hate to know that my kid had that sort of burden thrust on them.

Toward your brother: stop pushing him. It's not your business and it does no good. If he wants a relationship with your dad, he will decide that on his own and in his own time. He may never want it, and that's ok, too. It's his decision to make."
"He's sounds like a stupid immature jerk living in a fantasy world. I did similar thing to my highschool sweetheart when I was 20. Luckily I broke out of it, but damn I was an asshole."
"Congratulations! This is so sweet.

Don't stress out too much about the identity and label stuff. It might be nice to connect with local or online LGBTQ+ communities but really, just be in touch with your feelings and enjoy the relationship!"
"He saw no problem with lying and that's a problem too. Next time he tells OP about how he worked hard at his job and his boss complimented him, OP may wonder if that's the truth or the husband not having a problem with lying. When I see people who can tell loes that easily, my trust in them is broken and everything they say will come with the mental footnote ""if true""."
"&gt;  it's honestly so much I can't believe Sam hasn't said anything.  
  
That's always kind of been me/Doug(&amp; Amy)/Sam's dynamic. He hero-worships his brother, I think because Doug always did stick up for Sam as kids. Me, I take a certain pleasure in being a feminist killjoy to Doug (and occasionally Amy) and Sam wouldn't ever pick a side and I wouldn't ever make him. I don't know if he knows how this is different and actually really bothering me."
"Divert her attention elsewhere. Give her a few wedding related tasks to take care of. Invent them if you have to. Also think of something else that you'd like her to do to replace the singing and tell her you had your heart set on her doing that. Put your foot down. It's your day, not hers, so don't let your family railroad you into agreeing to things you don't want. "
"Ugh, boundaries are NOT close minded wtf. 

Good for you. Seriously. Time to move on to someone who won’t be close minded to your valid boundaries!"
She doesn't want her to sing at the reception or any part of the wedding.
"Hey boyfriend, I don't like your cats and won't be moving in with you/them.  

He'll probably end the relationship because that's what I would do if someone told me to choose them or my pets."
"Good idea to wait not just till after exams but after grading. I guess I'm just a bit impatient, 'cause I've liked him for a while now :) "
"&gt; She does want it all done, but she doesn't want to think about it because it overwhelms her. If I try to explain what needs to be done, she gets anxious and despairs about ever getting it done. So I'm left just doing it without telling her.

No. Stop doing that. If she can't face the reality of what needs to be done without this behavior, she's in no way ready to be a parent. She's not even being that functional of a wife because this avoidant behavior is stifling communication - the oxygen a marriage needs to survive, let alone thrive.

This needs to be addressed, and if it takes counseling to do it, best get it going. "
"No, no, no, no, no, no and NO.

Seriously. Read what you wrote. Really read it carefully and pretend this was someone else writing it. What would you think? What would your advice be?

Does this sound like a guy who is into you? Hell naw. "
Yes. That line showed he deserves to be cut off forever. Absolutely no empathy and an abusive piece of shit. 
"Seriously this speaks VOLUMES about who this woman is. She can be a nice person and still be totally overbearing, invasive and utterly boundaryless. Her poor daughter."
"$800 *a month*, not just $800. OP says this has been going on for 6 weeks, so that's $1200 so far. "
"It will take away from her existing siblings and that's a valid argument. The children you already have should come first. If she has existing adopted siblings they should come before this special needs toddler. 

Despite your pie in the sky fantasy resources, love, attention, and nurturing are limited. A special needs child could absolutely make life for her siblings worse because their mother has too much to handle. Even if the mom is already excellent at her job the special needs kid could be too much. "
"Thank you; I haven't been able to tactfully bring it up to see what was going on with him before. I feel like there was a ton of stress on him at the time (his coworker quit and he had to handle a department solo, while dealing with the boss from hell, his parents were nagging him to fix their computers/rewire the house, etc.). It was just bad timing. And honestly my anxiety has made me so stressed out that I'm not always the best conversationalist. 

I absolutely need to have that conversation with him, and as you said, if he can just be there as a dad, that's great, and I'm happy baby will have a loving dad (since I didn't), but I can't wait forever."
"At the moment  gender is sibling's number one issue, but sibling's gender is not the number one priority for the whole world. Sibling needs to understand that it'll take time for people to adapt."
"This is the problem with verbal abuse: you can never unhear what was said. And instead of him getting help on his own for *his* problem, now you're looking into therapy so you can fix the damage *he* caused. And it's likely you might carry this baggage forward into the next relationship. Just an outsider's perspective based on what you wrote here.

This response is less about telling you what to do OP an more about highlighting this as a warning to other people going through similar relationship issues. It's a red flag when someone blames *you* for their problems. "
"Use this as an object lesson for your daughter:  ""Sometimes people say they are going to do something, but then they do not, and when that happens, it hurts people's feelings, like when your feelings were hurt when TeacherP said she would come but did not.  That's why it's important to always tell people the truth about what you are going to do."""
"I had an up and down relationship with my dad growing up (my parents divorced when I was 2). He was involved, then we’d get in a fight, wouldn’t talk for a bit. Rinse. Repeat. 
When I was in my mid teens, my mom ended up taking my dad back to court to increase his child support, because he had a bigger income then he’d had a decade ago and according to the cut and dry, child support income scale should have been paying more many many years ago. My mom talked to me/I think explained why she was doing it and that it might upset my dad before she did it. 

Predictably, when he learned of the coming increase he wasn’t grateful for all the years he saved money not paying, he was outraged about paying what every other dad at his income level was expected to pay. 

Several times when he came to pick me up, he was rude to my mom etc. But I didn’t blame my mom. I was mad my dad was being a jerk to her. 

To this day, I in no way blame my mom for asking for increased child support. Yes, drama ensued as a result. But there was drama on and off with my dad. 

I’m grateful my endured the drama on my behalf. She was able to save that money for me to use for university and my future is better for it. 

Even if you don’t need the money now. Your son might find it helpful down the road. Because let’s be honest, cheapskate dad ain’t coming up with money for university unless a court forces the issue"
"&gt;but its not like I can go up to the girl and ask her.

You could actually. You could have her sit down with you and your wife and her parents and possibly even a court appointed mediator and state everything she believes happened between you two.

I mean, how else do you prove you are not a liar unless you confront the accusation head on and with the righteous indignation of the innocent?

I find it a little odd that your wife, a psychologist, would throw out a very specific term like ""predator"". I know not everyone graduates at the top of their class and some doctors are just terrible, but I'm pretty sure that someone who works with kids AND is a trained psychologist AND knows anything at all about predators, wouldn't just be all, ""YOU'RE A PREDATOR!"" 

She's your wife and she's siding with this stranger who SHE brought into the home? As are your kids? Your biologically kids?

All of these people in your life think you are a predator? Your FAMILY thinks you are a predator?

And you turn to reddit for advice? And very blase like, ""Oh dear...everyone in my life thinks I am a predator. That's not good, right?""

Seems fishy.

You don't even seem offended that your wife and child think you molested someone or that you are capable of it."
"So a mans who's almost thirty, refuses to move out of his parents home but wants you to show up once in awhile with a baby and visit him? No-please get child support from him from the courts-he will most definitely will not pay you or help you when's this baby is born. "
"Respectfully, she should break up with him because he DID humiliate her AND because he has no idea what she wants and who she is - and because he thought she was so fickle she could be persuaded to change her mind in a moment out of guilt at his efforts. "
"I'm going to suggest a different tactic than many other posters here. 

Obviously what's happening to you at work isn't okay. It's demeaning, it's embarrassing, and down right fucking ridiculous. They know they're making you uncomfortable, they just don't care. It's a power trip. Unfortunately this is the culture of many sales teams, especially at a car dealership. (I'm in sales, male dominated field)

I suggest you punch back. The next time Mike walks by and makes a shitty pass, I'd respond ""You know I would never fuck you, right?"" The next time Rob leans onto your back? ""Dude, when was the last time you took a shower?"" And get up with a disgusted look on your face. Watch their ego take the hit. They'll back off. 
"
"Oh my god yeah, like she's doing it intentionally. I think she's just a free loader. No way you can paint but not open a door, she's a con artist. I haven't even been able to draw in ages and I'm not as depressed as I was."
"Its not the gifts. It's the food, the laptop, and the living disparities. "
"I smashed my phone six months after my boyfriend and I started dating, and didnt have the money to replace it (grad school). He lived at home at the time and was making 50k a year. He replaced it immediately and never brought it up again.

SIX MONTHS."
"You didn’t do anything wrong at all. He’s allowed to want to break up because of this, but he’s clearly being manipulative. "
"I think this time of year makes it even easier to make contact with people.  You could always just message her with a simple ""Happy Holidays, just realised it's been a while since we last caught up. Should we catch-up again soon for a coffee?"" (or whatever was your normal catch-up situation).
Good luck, don't be afraid to reach out. I often lose contact with people for a few years before re-kindling friendships. Time is not always a barrier."
OP is a jerk who made incorrect assumptions.
"Wife already is mad at the OP for not straight up literally giving her sister a free job solely because she's her sister, and for offering professional critiques which is totally discrimination. You're not going to find a way to spin this list as anything but a litany of insults, to her ears; this is *exactly* about repairing his relationship by knowing how to goddamn pick your battles."
"Do you know the amount of his student loans, and any other debt he has? Amount of savings? Retirement savings? Emergency fund? 

Keeping finances separate is fine (it works great for me and my SO), but as with everything in relationships requires open communication and trust. "
"Your mom did you wrong. She knows it, siblings know it, everyone will know it whoever finds out.

You've learned something valuable; You don't owe them anything.

However, you're a business student and a businesswoman. Assess your strengths and weakness, liabilities and assets. You have the education and experience in an industry which your step-sister has no training in and no responsibility.

You have no obligation to help her nor should you do so, especially when she comes in and saying you're a ""sore loser"". Um, fuck that honey, I was your meal ticket and your guru, now you're just another brat who I can safely tell to fuck off. Your mother has caused a rift in the family; she can be the one to sort it out.

Someone else has suggested starting up a competing business. I think this is a great idea. I also think you can do whatever you want now. You're free from the family clutches. No more obligations and responsibility. Your siblings can step in now. Granted, your mother will likely shower them with gifts and acknowledgement and barely acknowledge if at all anything you have done for her. Let her, she's useless.

When people start to notice your business, and how much more properly it is run, they will flock to yours over your sister's. Key employees may want to join your shop over the other one because, quite frankly, it is more likely your sister will run that into the ground. 

I'm sorry for what's happened to you. You cannot let this cripple you; it means they have won. They don't deserve to win; so don't let them. "
"Damn, he is 21. Of course he is shocked. This is his first break up.  It hurts like hell.  He'll be fine after a while, but processing the first break up always takes a lot of time."
"You should not ask him out if you do badly because then it might seem like you were intent on sleeping with him in order to change the grade after finding out you got a bad one.

I don't actually agree with that line of reasoning, but they did mean that as the answer to your question."
"Duke is one of those schools that sells practically anything with their logo on it (source: went to another big sports school in the south), so you may be able to find an ornament with the Duke insignia on it. It will obviously not replace the one she had, but it will at least show you care and tried to help her out."
"If you think it might be getting worse it's worth taking him to a doctor. It's possible that there's some issue that's underlying. As an example, an older relative of mine started getting quite clumsy and forgetful, which we chalked up to old age until after a few years went past and he crashed his car and became a danger. Then he got checked out and it turned out he'd had a stroke about 10 years beforehand (roughly, it was so old they couldn't pinpoint it exactly). So look sometimes it's worth just checking; it would have saved him a lot of frustration and heartache if he'd found out sooner and it had been managed more effectively. "
"I guess in this situation, I'd be fucking pissed if I was Mary. She's the one have her choices dictated and she's an adult. That's why everyone is jumping on that train. 

Yes, Stu can cut off the friendship, but he's being a jerk of a brother. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like that. "
"16 year old girl?!

Tell the police."
"Agreed. OPs child seems to be struggling with enough issues at such a young age, let’s not force him to endure this abusive environment."
"Your ex is behaving like a child.  

""too early? "" you broke up five weeks ago, and are now only stuck in the same house.  


These aren't your friends,  they are trying to manipulate their life to what they want.  They don't actually care about you.  Especially your so called friend trying to guilt trip you put of dating because what... They had a disagreement years ago? 

They both need to grow up.  "
"Calm down. Nobody is suggesting to tie him down and operate against his will.

&gt; I had my tubes tied because my boyfriend didn't want a vasectomy.

So what? That was your relationship, not OP's."
"Maybe I'm just petty but I'd throw a nasty comment back.

'Daughter, you'd be pretty without the baby fat blah blah blah...' 

'Mom, those pants make your ass look big. You should change.'

'Have you done something different with your hair colour? It's washing you out and making you look sick for some reason.'

'How much wine have you had, mom? Think that's enough?'

Just whatever you can throw back at her. Show her how it feels.

Your weight is your business. She can leave you alone. She's not even coming at it from a place of care - like daughter I'm concerned about your health - it's all 'you could be pretty if....' and that's a really shitty thing to say to another person."
I'm with you. I think he was trash talking the relationship and now is trash talking the friend to try and get back on OPs good side. 
"&gt; This is highly suggestive of an ongoing agreement rather than OPs husband helping a friend out in a difficult situation

Agreed. If she needed about a grand to get by until Christmas because of unexpected expenses, why didn't he just give her the $1500 all at once if it was no big deal? Who needs $200 a week every week from their married friend?"
"Ah to be young and wonder ""what does it mean when my girl grabs my friends dick repeatedly?"". Dude come on, you know the answer to this. "
"Dude, there's not gonna be any anal after you're married either"
Look I'm not saying leave her right here and now but you need to remember Protect yourself if she absolutely refuses to get help. 
"I don’t know where you live, but kids in my country get charged with fucked-up things for sharing their own nudes. Delete her pics immediately and ask her to delete yours. 

You’re right though, she’s too young for you."
Please don't flash goose down the toilet. 
Yeah... they are older and probably more mature.
"It may help if that is extended to ""...and other special occasions"" but based on him saying that he would buy one an ""attempt"" to wear it, I'm not sure he's going to be okay with that compromise.  "
"You know, it’s not that hard to get to talking with someone in another department, and it’s definitely better to start talking casually than to ask him directly if he’s gay/bi or not. 
Some potential conversation starters:
“Hey, I walk by everyday and am so curious—what is it that you all *do* in this department anyway? I mean, what do *you* do?” 
“Sorry to interrupt you here, but what is [x] on your desk? It looks super [x]!” 
“Hey there, I walk by every day and just wanted to let you know that I really like the [article of clothing] you wear! Where do you get them?” 

Just smile real big and seem excited and it should do the trick!! Then keep talking to him—maybe not every day but often, until you feel comfortable enough to ask him to have coffee with you or something! "
"Why should you be putting in the effort to fix this? She's the one who betrayed you.

You should be concentrating your efforts on moving past this woman, improving your self esteem, and building your self respect. 

This may not sound logical to you, but any efforts you put in to fixing this are going to be viewed by your ex-fiancee as weakness. She will think that she can betray you, and you'll put up with it. She's forced your hand here. There really is only one decision that allows you to keep your self respect intact, and that is to cut her loose. It's unfortunate, but this is the situation SHE put you in.

Don't let her put any of this on you. You lived together for 3 months, and from what you described, she didn't carry herself very well.  Was she being difficult because her affections were already with this other guy, or did she go to this guy because she felt things were difficult? It doesn't matter. She betrayed you and there is no excuse for that. 

This is how she behaves after 3 months of living together? Buddy, your marriage didn't stand a chance in hell, even before she cheated on you.

"
"your problem is you want to approach him with the word ""GAY"" in your mind

approach him with the word ""PERSON"" inyour mind, and just have a conversation with him. whenever you pass him by greet him with nods. then a day or two later ""whats up"" and a nod. next week ""hows it going man. good weekend?""

and from there you can deduce through your conversations whether he's interested or not"
"If the boyfriend didn't want to support his gf through school, he shouldn't have stayed with her or he should've been up front with the fact that he wasn't ok taking on so much financial burden. I worked for 2 years while my gf was finishing school and while it definitely grating at times, I accepted that I took on more financial responsibility as she was working towards her life goals and I still did the small things to keep the relationship strong.

OP is struggling to afford to eat and go to her classes and that's not ok."
"I think you are absolutely right.  I didn't go into every single detail in my post, but he has brought me nothing but pain (often times on purpose).  I did talk to my grandparents, and they didn't even mention him in the conversation.  I feel so much better now.  "
"Do you think it's something that I should never ever bring up? I only wonder what she thinks of me after doing something like that. 

I've always like her but I'm not much of a good looking guy &amp; all, never really been on a date myself. If I thought that asking her out before was a long shot imagine how I feel about it now after this..

"
It’s tacky af. He needs to develop some subtlety for crying out loud. 
Or Alex presented as feminine to make things easier for himself. Tell him exactly what you said here and see what he says. It’s important to trust your partner to make the best choices for themselves and to not continually question their motives if they clearly say otherwise. 
"Wouldn't she have encouraged him then to make sure I knew who she was before coming over there? Is it more ethical to let me show up at her house without realizing his mom was my therapist? It seems like either way it's not ethical, even ignoring the fact that she certainly did much worse than breaching confidentiality in the first place. "
"I love the image of ""my baby pals""."
Lol we had dinner and a movie during which she gave me some advice that our relationship is doomed. Isn't she a great friend? 
"It's difficult to do. I knew back then he monitored all her internet activity. He's initially the one who reached out to me over Facebook and told me Bea would want to be friends with me and talk to me. I ended up talking to Tom even more, I got sucked in to his nonsense. I was feeling a bit lonely because I had to put my dog down on Christmas Eve. It was an OK conversation until he started bringing up the past. We've always been able to talk to each other easily. 

I just don't know what to do or how. I believe things happen for a reason and now I'm in contact with Bea again and it's just mind blowing because I thought my sweet girl was gone forever.

"
"&gt;You've jumped from someone lying about their age to get dates to someone being a predator. I have no respect for this guy, but that's a bit unfounded. 

I think someone saying they are 15 years younger than they are is a sign of a predator, or at least someone with serious issues.

Also, weight is not what we're talking about. We're talking about age."
"Yes it was a big clot in her leg, very painful.  The clot seems to have subsided but still have to take the shots.

"
"Seriously, or even if they can't afford that, sitting the kids down one night and saying something like ""Let's draw pictures for Mommy for Christmas!"" or ""Let's make Mommy some treats for Christmas!"" It's bonding time AND she'll end up with something. This guy sounds so self centered and like he doesn't care about his wife at all."
"Thanks for the advice, I’m definitely going to give it some thought. I worry my sister will end up like them, the other day she said ‘Hannah said you’re a bitch and I agree with her’. The first time she’s ever in 10 years said something hurtful to me.
Merry Christmas to you also :)"
"&gt;If she's so distraught over this, then why is she still with OP

 Because she's in a relationship with him, and not his parents?

And I bet you dollars to donuts that dad is the kind of person that will rant for hours about politics, but if you *dare* say anything that contradicts his views he will go off on you and call you a moron. 

How is she throwing a fit? Because she doesn't want to prepare a meal she won't even partake in right before a work shift? Come on buddy"
"Our relationship has honestly been shit the past few weeks. I've told him I don't feel like I'm being appreciated and it turned into him saying I'm the reason why he can't finish his work on time (it's not true at all). I feel like this may be a deliberate signal to me or something at this point, but I thought all was going well when he was excited about telling me about the gift being sentimental."
"I don't think it's fair to ""dictate how much money,"" but I think it's okay to be honest about what you want in life.


If he wants the type of life that $X can afford, that's okay. But it won't be wirh you. 



What are his responses when you look into expenses together...what type of living situations you want and why you need a certain level of income? How does he expect you to make that amount? Does he tell you that he shouldn't be a NICU nurse or is he just completely ignorant about earning potential? "
"Porn is fine but for me interacting crosses a pretty clear boundary.

Aside from that, he should love you for who you are and not be putting pressure on you for things like boob jobs.

Everyone’s definition of cheating is different but I feel like interacting sexually with other people is something that’s cheating until both people agree it isn’t.

I would lay your concerns on the table but it’s probably more about the interaction than it is with him pressuring you to look a certain way.

Also, for what it’s worth, I look at porn of women that don’t look like my wife on occasion and certainly never the same “type” or “look”. First, my wife is my ideal not the least of which because she’s my wife. Second, it’s not a desire for her to look like anyone else it’s just a variety thing honestly."
"I just don't get this, though. I assume your point is that opposite genders are usually a boundary because of some implied level of attraction, but he's gay. What about a female lesbian friend? If you answered no to that, how come? Or if you say yes, that bothers you too, then doesn't it stand to reason that the male gay friend shouldn't? It just seems like such an arbitrary line to draw based on *your* expectation when in fact there is no danger."
"Before you even posted OP stated that she was in their will as caretaker for all siblings. It will affect her, or in the very least she obviously needs to tell them that if they go through with it, she will not be involved.

Also, caring for disabled people is hard. Period. There are resources, like you mentioned, but not nearly enough and not everyone has the resources to access them. There's nothing in her post that suggests prejudice. Not wanting to sign up to be a part of caring for a disabled person is a valid personal preference and I'm not sure why there's always that one person who has to come along saying ""but it's not reaaalllly that bad you guys."" She literally states that the child is not expected to be high functioning, indicating the child has already had a medical evaluation.

Wanting to do something good is not a free pass to ignore practicalities. Her parents clearly have a history of expecting her to be there for her siblings in their absence, so her concerns are completely warranted."
"Well maybe it's his dead mom, you're right, way more realistic."
"&gt; I guess the problem in my mind is that if I made some sacrifices I actually could afford to pay her back, but it would mean not having any spending money for the rest of my trip.

IMHO, it's less about being able to splurge on a bunk bed as opposed to a hammock in a common area or even a meal at a restaurant, and more about the many, many ""what ifs"" that could happen while you complete your trip. If you get yourself down to a point where you have no funds to spare, you're putting yourself in a precarious situation abroad. Most likely, nothing will happen that will force you to use that money on anything except luxury choices, but you absolutely don't want to risk it.

She's at home with means of support other than herself. She can sit until you're home."
"I can fully see how your embarrassed your husband by posting that picture on facebook. What's more important to you -- taking acting classes with your crush, or your marriage? Find another place to take acting classes."

"Actually he doesn't have to right to touch his wife ""intimately."" I'm interpreting that as him touching her vagina (OP please feel free to correct me) and she got a fright. I agree that her punching him was not an appropriate response but that kind of behaviour is usually grown from being disregarded before about bodily autonomy. 

Also if my partner touched me in the middle of the night after a fight I would probably start screaming or flinging elbows. This could have been a flight or fight response. "
"No, I didn't. The younger of the two mothers-to-be, herein referred to by me as Younger Mom, is 48. In eighteen years, she will be 66, more than twenty years younger than OP's grandmother is now.

"So I’m in the camp of ‘this is worrying but can be worked on’

Your husband, in a fit of anger backhanded his pregnant wife. That is unacceptable under any circumstances. 

People in the comments are writing it off (and you too to an extent) because he’s never done it before and he’s apologised profoundly. 

What happens when your child is born if you do something stupid? (Which you both will. It happens) Will it be OK then?

I’m not saying this is irredeemable but it’s worrying. And yes I would be on the lookout. The leading cause of death in pregnant women is at the hands of the babies father. Leading cause. And abuse starts when big life changes happen. 

Be on your toes. I hope for everyone’s sake that this is a one off. But hitting someone in anger is never ok. "

"A lot of abuse survivors get asked how they will feel when their abuser dies,  my answer is and has always been, I grieved the loss a long time ago.

"Please get her to see a doctor. She could be experiencing post partum psychosis. It's a very rare condition but could explain her change in behaviour.

Please do everything you can to keep yourself and your daughter safe."
"People don't level accusations like that for fun. People don't get together and make up corroborating stories like this. It's scary, it's socially uncomfortable, and you risk your friends thinking that you're a liar. Believe them. After all, what evidence do you think you're going to get? Video? 

You may be right that people are quicker to believe that he's a predator because he's gay. That doesn't mean that he's not one. 

I feel for you. I dealt with this a few years ago with a close friend of mine. After his girlfriend (my other close friend) broke up with him, a friend confessed to her that the guy had been inappropriate with her. The ex girlfriend decided to do a little digging, and women started coming out of the woodwork with stories about him they'd been too embarrassed or felt too scared or awkward to tell. I hadn't known. I'm a woman and he'd never done anything out of line with me. His girlfriend hadn't known. But still: there were multiple stories about him preying on people we all knew. We haven't spoken in years. "
"I wouldn't consider his actions appropriate at all. Sexting a coworker and messaging live people would fall under ""Cheating"" in my book. This will not always be the same for everybody but that is my expectations in my relationships.

*he is not going to change.* He will keep doing this, he will not stop.

Your suspicions will intensify. Your anxiety over what he's up to will get worse. You will snoop and check up on him every chance you get. You'll find stuff. He'll deny or say it doesn't mean anything. You'll feel like shit. You'll never feel good enough for him. He'll be contrite for a while but when you've calmed down, he'll be right back at it.

&gt;He said he's ruined our relationship when he texted his ex and we both can just break up and move into shitty apartments or we can ""handle it like adults.""

He's right on the first part, his actions put a bomb right in the middle of you guys. It's unfortunate that he needs to immediately dismiss you by saying you can break up OR handle it like adults. Adults break up, being an adult and breaking up are not mutually exclusive.

My advice?

You are not happy and have not been happy for a long time. I have been in a similar situation as you, including the phone checking and computer checking. It will drive you mad and your boyfriend will just get better and better at hiding it. You may be worried you won't find someone else, but you will. You may not want to ""throw away four years"" but you won't be. You're young and it's easier to say but there really are plenty of fish in the sea and many of them would never consider starting conversations with random girls who post pics on Reddit or start sexting with coworkers. So, do you want to spend the next month, year, or decade playing this same game? Only you can really decide, but I know what I would do."
"Is it really safe to confront them? I'm not trying to be paranoid or scare OP and I'm not saying they'd outright assault her but, well, one I don't know these guys enough to know what even one of them would be capable of doing and, two, they already don't respect her/are gross douchebags when she's been nothing but kind to them. How are they going to handle any type of rejection?

I personally agree with everyone telling OP to find alternative living arrangements if possible BEFORE saying anything. In the mean time, avoid them. Even if they don't hurt you, OP, they clearly don't deserve your friendship. "
"I strongly disagree that nobody was wrong.

During my dating years, I was in the situation more than once where I was with somebody for a while, and while they were great people and we got along fine, I just got to the point where I knew she wasn't the one. At that point I ended it. Because even though there was nothing specifically wrong with them and I could go on just being 'comfortable' indefinitely, it wasn't fair to them. They wanted more, and had a right to expect that. I'd be eating up prime dating years of theirs on a relationship I knew in my heart wouldn't last.

After a certain period of time, you owe it to the person you're with to make your intentions clear. Either get married or move on, difficult as that may be. He took the more cowardly, lazy comfortable approach and that's not fair to her."
"The minute you brought up having feelings for her, the friendship was already over. There is no going back at this point.

I think some people think she over reacted, but I think this is a pretty common reaction.

She had you, a friend and was happy to have you. She loved the relationship of just hanging out and chatting, be friends.

Now that romance has been brought into it, the friendship is completely gone and blown to pieces. She is mad about losing that and mad at you for ruining it.

That being said, you can't help feeling what you feel. It's ok to be mad about the situation, but she isn't entitled to your friendship just like you aren't entitled to be in a relationship with her.

With all that, you never know. She might fester on it a bit and figure she did like you in her life and would be open to trying something, we'll see."
"I don’t know dude. I think you took too long to turn it around and she’s checked out mentally/emotionally. Couples counseling? Maybe check out the Gottman’s research/work shops/books? At this point, yeah, Bob’s gotta go, but you gotta reel in your expectations of your wife’s reaction to you only NOW deciding you want to be a husband."
"&gt;(he started ranting at one point about how all men only want one thing, [...] Please tell me what you think.

I mean, your boyfriend pretty much told you that if he were in Ben's place, he'd make a move on his grieving friend. Someone's overreacting, but it's not you."

Do not, under any circumstance, let step mom manipulate her way into being reinvited. She'll only cause more trouble at the wedding. If the dad decides to stand by step mom after he's heard your side, then that's his choice. You can't force him to prioritize his daughter and you guys can't be forced to ruin your special day for one person.

P. S. If you feel the need to post about step mom in the future, r/JUSTNOMIL will welcome you with open arms."
"""Father figure"" is WAY worse.

""Papa Bear"" describes HIS feelings towards THEM. ""Father figure"" implies that he's doing them a service (and dredges up the specter of ""daddy issues"", etc.)"
"My ex left his bike at my place for a whole year after we broke up, and refused to come collect it even though we reached out about it many times. So we donated it. If he doesn't collect his stuff soon (set a deadline) then donate/trash it, its not up to you to safely store his crap anymore now that you aren't together."
"This, so much. I feel outraged that OP is with this guy. He doesn't deserve her."
"Because you’re normal and you invested a little in a person who showed interest in you. 

He’s acting like this because he’s being dishonest and crappy. 

You win because you’re not a shitty person. Move on and count yourself lucky you didn’t spend more time with this turd. "
"What compelled you to say these things? I mean, I can understand a mess up once, but how come there’s a few, with a couple in the past? 

"
There's nuanced advice to be given here but save yourself the trouble and just prepare to divorce this guy. He doesn't respect you and your attempts to get him to start probably won't amount to anything.
"I think you need to check your expectations. $50-100 is plenty to buy something really nice. The fact that she's staying within that range instead of spending outside of her means is a *good* thing, and you should follow her example. Not overspending doesn't make you cheap, it makes you practical.

As for her frustration that she doesn't put enough thought into your gifts, I have to ask: Do you give her some suggestions about things you might like, or are you consistently hoping she'll manage to guess the perfect present for you? "
"He definitely would tell me if he got a deal on them. He knows I would be more upset if he spent more money on me. He used to spend more and I’ve talked him down to a lower budget. I still think $300 is too much, but this is something he wants to do and he disagrees with how much he thinks he should spend on me."
"It’s the lie. If she had been honest, I would have been forgiving. I’ve cheated in the past and I get it. It’s the sustained affair on top of the sustained lie over the course of years of building a relationship and life. That’s too big for me to just move past. 

I still love her, but Ive made my decision and am willing to deal with the consequences. "
"Dump this chucklefuck. What a waste of carbon. He doesn't even know the meaning of the idea of respect. Does he think makeup is free? Doesn't even matter - someone who thinks you're ""cute"" when you're angry (ugh God I'm gagging at how gross this is) is just vile. "
Let me get this straight:  She told him that you and your boyfriend shouldn't be together and then takes him on a date?   
"OK, but you know now.

Perhaps it's Chelsea's fault, but also have you considered that this could just be something so *painful and personal* that Chelsea would prefer not to discuss it, not even with you?

You describe Chelsea as brattish, but is that fair? Maybe you just aren't very good at dealing with her opposition?

&gt;I feel like I am blackmailed to act mean to this person I don't even know deserves this.

True. So it comes down to this: do you trust your daughter? or more to the point, are you prepared to act as if you trust your daughter?  Think carefully, because continuing to be friendly with Rachel WILL drive you and your daughter apart. 



 

"
"&gt;All that being said, he treats me well when this shit isn't going down.

Everybody's relationship is good when the ""bad shit"" isn't going down. But it seems like there is a lot of bad shit here, and it's pretty fucking bad.

I mean, I feel like I don't even need to give you advice. Just read your post out loud to yourself and pretend a friend was telling you all that. What would you tell them?"
"She gave you the green light for every once in awhile, and you violated that agreement with her. You violated that pact, and that's not okay. Scale it back, or quit completely. It's not worth it to your family and your future wife. "
"Not just the business; she's been her mother's primary caretaker, too. "
"Carry around a recording device.

He could be saying these things, or you could be having auditory hallucinations."
"He might of have been the guy she wanted to do it with, but the idea of doing it in general may have been on the horizon. Its ok if you dont wanna be with her because of this reason. There are plenty of women out there who you wouldnt need to go on break for. Maybe its time you tried your hand at something new. I know its not ideal right now with your emotions running wild, but im sure alot of us know exactly what you're going through. We can assure you, it does get better. That hole in your heart with close up and the pain will subside. Things will get better.
"
"I don't think you have a good grasp on just how selfish you are.  

By hiding your infidelity from him for _years_ until finally he married you, **you manipulated him**. You intentionally distorted his perception of what you are. And in return, he gets a wife that became much fatter, much less stable, and was a betrayer this entire time.  

The only person I feel bad for is him.  

Because now he loves you, and now he's in too deep to just dump you. Now he goes off to service, risks his life, while he will be haunted by resentment and agony from what you did.  

He is the victim and there's no clear way out for him. "
"Ditto this suggestion. And it should be safe, right, as long as the recorder doesn't face the hallway or something? Since the camera would be just in OP's room?"
"Why do you think you know more about vaginal discharge and bleeding than a 28yo woman? Seriously, why do you think that she doesn't understand her own body well enough to know when to test? You need to focus your energy on buying condoms and literally anything else besides the state of your ex's womb. "
"&gt; He doesnt know any better. Its how he was raised.

Your cousin is a grown-ass man. Tell him to start acting like one. You arent in the wrong on this one."
Because they’re going to go from working with a patient with c diff to working with a patient who’s weak and susceptible to diseases including c diff? Hospital requirements are so stringent because they are working with multiple patients with weak immune systems.  Unless op and his wife have weak immune systems then it should be fine.
She already tried to explain it to him. He did his rule-yelling thing. He is owed no further explanations.
"Okay but you get that she's not viewing this as HER not wanting children, but as HER AND HER LIFE PARTNER both mutually not wanting children.  Right?"
It’s absolutely cheating. How would she feel if you started sexting other girls?
"&gt; It's naive to believe that. If they get sick, we all know they're going to come crying to OP's husband to take care of the baby because they're family, and family doesn't abandon each other (that's the argument they will use).

Those are some impressive psychic powers you have there. 

We have no idea what their attitude is, we have no idea if they have other kids besides OP's husband, and frankly this just sounds like some serious projecting nonsense."
"This actually makes me feel a lot more confident in my parenting. I carry a lot of guilt about bringing them into the world with my ex as their father. He’s so unreliable and disappointing, but I work to more than make up for it. It’s legitimately harder to do this alone, but my self respect and patience wouldn’t let me stay in that crap relationship (hint hint OP!)"
In the Navy myself for 13 years and counting. Thia won't be the last time you get called in on duty. His family probably would have understood. Please run away as fast as you can. This will only escalate. 
"Maybe you should just move on. He sounds like a jerk.
"
Pregnancy is the most dangerous time for women. Because of their abusive male partners. 
"*I think this is the right answer. They don’t know you, why would they want to spend their cherished family memory with you!* "
Seems far more likely that they'd receive even less attention than before and become resentful of their new sibling.
"My boyfriend and I don't share finances yet and don't have a limit, but I just can't imagine this kind of spending not coming up in conversation. Not in an 'asking for permission' way, but in a, 'tell me about your day' way!"
"I think you're really romanticizing what it's like to care for a special needs child. My uncle once told me, in tears, that raising my severely autistic cousin is the ""worst thing that's happened to him."" (Not saying these two conditions are the same, of course.) Sometimes raising children is not good for everyone, but is, in fact, difficult, painful, emotionally and financially taxing, and exhausting. The option you're presenting is a *possibility* but, given what OP has already outlined, unlikely. "
He let you pop it and everyone knows that there's a chance of scaring when you pop pimples. He needs to grow up he's being really immature and it's just a scar no one will even notice it. Tell him it isn't your fault and you're not going to put up with being treated like that. Don't apologise again and don't let him speak to you like that.
But this IS a choice. And one absent parent plus a long-term plan that amounts to “OP will have to deal with it” is not any kind of stable situation at all. 
"It's absolutely an ethical violation and you should tell his bosses. He's showing incredibly poor judgement, and he knows it.

No matter how well you got on, you deserved a period of healing without questioning any ulterior motives of the staff helping you. Listen to your gut - I think it shows you're getting healthier and are willing to stand up for yourself."
"&gt; He led me to the main bedroom and we had sex...

Yes, she admits she did. She was very thorough in her destruction."
"Plenty of people will happily let someone do something and then proceed to blame them if something goes wrong, even if it's not their fault.

We had a story recently where someone didn't pet sit and the dog died while at the kennel, I think even from something unrelated to being at the kennel, and the person got mad at OP saying it was their fault for not pet sitting.

It's irrational, but it happens."
"I'm a reformed cheater, when I was caught I was worse than your girlfriend, admittedly. One thing sticks out to me, she doesn't ever actually say ""holy fuck, this was wrong. There are so many ways I could have done this right but I literally chose one of the worst ways.""

Given my past, I am *very* sympathetic to the unfaithful partner is most posts. As long as she keeps mentioning the ""distance"" as the reason for her emotional affair she is refusing to acknowledge the actual problem. Problems in a relationship need to be resolved there and no amount of looking outside will change it.

Unless she actually shows remorse and not just a desire for consequences to go away I would cut her loose."
"I've been with my husband for 20 years - he's never once in all that time called me a single one of those names you list in your post. Never once.

And yet you get called those names very few months and you think that's ""not very often""?

That's not normal, it's not loving, it's not kind. You've asked him not to and he doesn't stop. It's not going to work itself out. That's not how adult life works.

You don't need to live this way. You don't need to share a life with a person who would call you those names to hurt you."
"How about he respects her culture? She said Christmas is very important to her. If they've been dating for a year and regularly talk as often as she says they do, he's got to understand Christmas is important to her. She's just supposed to shut that off because, oops, I'm white, my traditions don't count! Stop it."
"You aren't stuck. Start getting consultations and you will be able to find someone to work things out, it just might take some tried. You don't need your kids around this. You've learned some valuable, hard lessons here. But it will get better."
There is no medication or medical condition in the world that causes a 100lbs weight gain. It still comes down to overeating. 
"To clarify, 1 month ago, the break initiated. He started working there 1 week ago. Therefore, the break actually holds no bearing on her and this new guy?"
"Your fiancee needs to have her sister step down as a bridesmaid. Bridesmaids are supposed to be there to assist the bride, not make everything about themselves. SIL has already made it clear that she plans to make the wedding a showcase of her uniqueness."
"“It’s a little difficult to explain”

Well maybe you should try. The other glaring red flags aside, communication is definitely an issue in your marriage so you may as well start somewhere."
"Absolutely something happened and she is being polite by keeping it between her partner and herself.

Your brother needs to respect boundaries. Full stop. Asperger's is not  free pass to allow him to trample boundaries because he's on the spectrum. In fact, it's important to teach him because it could get him into situations like these.

He needs to see a behavior consultant if he is still having issues. Someday it can lead to something serious where a ""Tee hee, Asperger's!"" won't fix.

Stop showing him his disability allows him to be creepy and intrusive. Reinforce boundaries or he's going to alienate more people. It's not innocent. It's predatory on what he's doing. Stop feeding it and defending it."
"was diagnosed with BPD today. I guess I have bigger issues to work on. Thank you all, even for the harsh words. "
"Not from a professional experience but a personal one.  My father had a stroke in 1990.  It was considered very severe and the hospital had a lot of concerns.  There was a real worry that he wouldn't make it.  He passed in 2015.  Between those dates he went back to working 12 hour shifts, supervised massive renovations for a branch of the British Legion, was captain of a seniors golf team, had an epic and respectful love life and generally lived life to the very fullest.  

The thing that helped my father recover so fully was his attitude.  He refused to give in.  If you are concerned that your boyfriend will not be able to keep that sort of motivation with his parents around then is there anyway you can call him regularly, keep him supplied with funny memes, talk positively with him?  Can you make plans for roughly what happens after rehab?  How are his parents with you?  

It doesn't need to all fall on you.  I'm sure that there are plenty of friends who will be able to give him a call, drop him a text or share a funny thread on reddit.  

Sending good vibes.  "
"So, the entire point of your post is that your wife thinks your hobbies are stupid, but you throw a line in there that disparages everything your wife enjoys doing in her free time? I feel like she could post some of the same questions you’re asking. Sounds like you both need to work on respecting how the other person enjoys spending their time. "
"You say you're not romantically interested but then go do couple things with the guy: go to the market, spend time with his family, get flowers, gifts...

Why is your boyfriend sketched? Your talk doesn't match your walk. Actions speak louder than words, OP. You can keep telling us you're not romantically interested but I don't buy it."
The post says they range from elementary to high school. I don't know what the parents are thinking.
"There is no such thing as unfortunately having an affair.

It takes a lot of braincells and calculated effort to sneak around without being caught. Nope, your precious cousin knew what she was doing sneaking around like that behind her husband's back. I'm with your fiance on this. 

I find it mind-boggling a lot of times as I feel a lot of people here condone cheating by a woman. There's always comments that blame the poor guy who is unfortunately for cheated on. ""Oh, he must be abusive, that's why she cheated."" or the ""oh, you need to give her free spa and holiday because you're a shitty husband,"" when said husband found indications that wife could be on the brink on cheating on him, or is already cheating him, and many other examples.

OP, it is disturbing that you seem to condone your cousin's cheating behaviour.  "
"It's not just about the optics. He *never* mentioned anything to OP, and it's difficult to imagine that wasn't intentional on his part. It's been almost two months, and for him to have never said ""oh poor Rose, she's going through a lot since Douchebag McBabydaddy skipped out on her"" is really sketchy. How do these weekly meetings never come up unless he's deliberately avoiding the topic? "
"He is connected to his mother (and family) with a titanium umbilical cord.  It is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible to cut.  He fears leaving home.  He fears being on his own (with you) and making adult decisions.  He fears not having his mommy and daddy constantly at his side making decisions for him.  Does he cut his own food?

Seriously, he needs to grow up fast as there is a baby that he helped to create on the way.  You need to lay it all out and he needs to say either yes or no to a life with you and with the child. Like or not, he has reached the point in his life where he either becomes an adult or stays a child forever."
"&gt; She told me that she does love Jason and that she will continue to flirt with him and other friends in this manner because that's just who she is as a person, a 'flirty' person.

Oh. Okay.

Dump her. She's saying, ""This is how I am, deal with it!"" You don't have to deal with it. She knows it bothers you, she just **doesn't care.**"
"So an adult is confiding in you, a child (sorry OP but you’re well beyond your years but you’re a minor) *likely* about his sexual orientation that you may share. He’s also:

Bringing up sexual issues

Contacting you when clearly inebriated

Causing you feelings of frustration when he texts so much, but with well-placed comments to exact guilt in you 

This is grooming OP. It is. It doesn’t matter that you’re intelligent and super mature. He’s “trying it on”. Not okay. 

And let’s say he wasn’t! Let’s say he had good intentions. This is still beyond appropriate. 

It’s important to remember, people who have issues with basic boundaries like this *can often be unsafe*. Not always, but often. The priority is to protect yourself first and foremost. That means immediate distance. 

“Hey I’ll be working a lot and won’t be on my phone as much” is fine. Or something similar. Then let his texts go unanswered. Do not reply to continued texts; that’s harassment and it’s not innocent. "
"If you are going to have separate finances you can't spend more for his wants.

Stop doing this. Return to your undergraduate days and the two of you buy separate groceries and meal planning for yourself. Or do that co-op housemate thing, only buy what is on a democratically devised list.

Otherwise your finances are not separate, you're not being financially consistent with the separation "
"I have a gov job which is a niche, fairly chill, interesting and good money. I finaly got a perm contract after being temp for 3+ years, which very rarely happen where I m from. I can have it for life and it can provide for two if needed. However, I have been very clear with my gf that it is not something I can give up.

It does not seem to me that you had this conversation, it actually seem you lead her to believe, probably unintentionally, that you will be moving out of state at some point. She knows if you get the promotion it will be even Harder to give it up, Hence ultimatum.

Is there anywhere else you can move and still keep the contract?

"
"I just....,what?!? 
1. He is rude
2. He is incredibly ungrateful and tasteless
3. He is lazy and inconsiderate
4. He is unemployed and doing nothing to find a job
5. He let his PREGNANT girlfriend work TWO jobs and then complained about how tires HE was.
6. His general unpleasantness has led you to be ostracized from your family
7. He doesn't listen to you or give a damn about you.

Why oh why are you with this human being? Seriously, you're scared your child will end up like him, repeat that to yourself and fully digest it. Collect your baby and get away from this unrepentant, self-righteous loser."
"Well, his anger was triggered by a very specific and long-standing stressor, and it was directed to an inanimate object that wasn't monetarily or sentimentally valuable, and didn't put you in danger (I'm assuming you weren't standing nearby).  In terms of violent outbursts, that's about the best one could hope for.

Your fear is certainly justified though, and what he did is obviously not a healthy or acceptable way to handle his feelings.  I think now that he has calmed down and a little time has passed, it's time for a conversation.  He needs to make a drastic and fundamental change in his relationship with his family, because what he has now no longer works for you, or him for that matter.  I think your husband needs to come to terms that as long as mom is dangling the money over his head (and as an aside, how much money can it truly be if she's hitting him up to pay CC debt?), he's letting her have power over him.  He needs to let go, not only of the idea of the inheritance, but also of the idea of having a healthy and respectful relationship with his mom.  He will likely need a therapist to help him come to terms with it.  You're role in this is to explain how his actions made you feel, and insist on developing a meaningful solution (""I'm sorry, it'll never happen again"" is not a solution) to it.  And I do mean insist - you cannot be a hostage to his angry outbursts and the turmoil his dysfunctional relationship with his family throws YOU into (if you were begging him not to answer the phone when she called, it's obvious you are made to suffer over this as well).  He scared you.  You shouldn't be scared of the people you love.  So now he needs to fix it, and it's not a negotiation, it's you giving him a chance to fix it."
"He destroyed something of yours specifically to make you mad, so him and other people could laugh at you. Breaking up is not drastic ENOUGH."
"Oh believe me, I am livid. I love every single word of your post. 

He said Merry Christmas to me last night (I’m in the UK and he’s in Japan so it was Christmas already for him) but then when I woke up today (afternoon for him) he was an absolute asshat. 

This is not the first time he’s put this particular roommate above me (it’s a male roommate btw). It’s weird. 

I will chat to him about this tomorrow and if he doesn’t come around and acknowledge what he’s done, I will be leaving him. 

The trip is tricky to cancel mainly due to all the cancellation fees I’d have to pay (it’s less than 2 weeks away, I’m visiting him in his home country). I could go on my own but I’d have to pay heaps for accommodation and it would be hard because the whole trip would remind me of him. "
Call your lawyer and ask to increase clarity in the custody agreement about phone calls. Also post to /r/legaladvice
"&gt;His reasoning is that this situation could have completely been avoided if I just had done what he's asked me to do in the past (1) not fight and 2) REALLY REALLY tried to force him to wake up for such an important day).

It takes two to fight. If he doesn't want to fight he's free to agree with you about everything. And he's free to buy himself an alarm clock too. "
You will likely need to refinance to get his name off the loan.
I don't think uninviting her would be stooping to her level. Remember what she said to your husband. Don't you owe it to your husband to protect him from that?
"A. They already raised children, so they have some parenting cred. You don't.

b. They are the grandparents. That's a more central role than niece.

C. I doubt they sat reading a book on the couch when they spent time with him.

"Depends on where he's located, hence the need for a lawyer like, yesterday."
She's holding onto the rose-colored future that she can't stop dreaming about 
"&gt;When I described my 'problems' my Pa assured me that everything I had just said was completely normal, and that he had gone through the exact same feelings at my age and was completely fine, and that I just needed some more life experience under my belt.

No, it isn't completely normal  It is a sign of severe anxiety and perhaps agoraphobia.  Talk to the therapist.  Don't tell you parents if you are worried how they'll react.  if something is wrong with your heart or liver, you go to the doctor don't you?  Why wouldn't you do the same here?"
I’m not sure how people who are looking for friends are making it harder for people who are looking for dates. Specifically on bumble you won’t even see the people who are not trying to date. When you’re under the friendship setting you only see other people who are also under the friendship setting.  
"So, he's already made it weird and uncomfortable. I think that I'd install locks and put your kitchen items away. 

You could move the TV into your bedroom. But, I never liked a TV in there because I would have small groups over for video game nights, and the super bowl, and movie nights. So the kitchen/common area was a better space for the number of people. You could invite a large group over to watch a movie starting before he gets in and then the sequel while he's there. You could give him a heads up that he may want to move his mattress back to his bedroom because it's going to be crowded/noisy. 

Or you could just go with it. But at night, get a glass of water, break some ice, forget about a dish you needed to watch, go back and forth and constantly trip over his mattress and him. Make decaf coffee so the noise and smell wake him up. Ideally, he'll realize how unsuitable a place this is for sleeping.

Otherwise, I'd bring my mattress in there too at night after he in settled, say something like ""slumber party."" Rustle a bag of chips, offer him some. And turn on the TV low. "
"You say you love her with all your heart but you're not *in* love with her, so...what's the distinction? What does being **in love** mean to you?"
"Like, he could have shared the wine."
I think most reddit relationship relationship threads just want validation. When I posted about my ex months ago I already kinda knew I was done.
If you don't want certain jokes made then don't make them yourself. You joke about your cooking and he made a similar joke. You made a joke about killing yourself and he followed up on it. 
"No, having a child and parenting correctly is the ""way to stay"". Don't act like all children and family dynamics are this much of a flaming dumpster fire. "
Didn't mean that she had to pick this Sunday I just kinda picked a random day. But yeah. Some dat convenient that's soon atleast 
"2 recommendations

1. Don't go, and tell your family why.

2. Go, and gay/feminist it up.  make them as miserable as they have made you.

Seriously, don't stop being who you are just to please your father?  Tell the daughter she is beautiful just the way she is.  Tell the son he is in for a rude awakening in the real world, and don't hide who you are.  Maybe wear a small ""I can't even think straight"" button or something."
"Oh man, if shoulder-devil was an occupation, I would have found d my calling! "
"They've been together 3 years. That's a perfectly reasonable amount of time to consider moving in together. Sounds like they're incompatible but he's not a bad guy for wanting to take the next step. 

But she's just finishing college and he's pushing 30. They're at different places in life."
"She should have put the money into her own account. She decided to put it in yours without talking to you and that’s on her.

Pay her back when you can because it’s the right thing to do but she needs to understand the position she’s put you in here."
"""The ring he got for his ex...""

Wtf! He shouldve returned it and gotten you a new ring. I'm not a woman, but if I was I would feel uncomfortable being given a ring that was originally purchased for another woman. "
"You’re only getting his side of the story with the ex. I had an ex who tried to smother me and it made me more distant as a result. It’s very possible that this woman is perfectly capable of having a healthy relationship outside someone like your bf.

Also, what kind of hobbies/passions/activities does your boyfriend have outside of work? Or does he depend entirely on his romantic partners to derive his self worth, security, etc? "
"These guys are assholes. I personally wouldn’t be comfortable being around them anymore, could you ask your landlord about moving. Also, your English is really good, if you hadn’t said it was your second language I wouldn’t have known"
It’s Qalo and my husband wears one because he works out a lot. I would rather have him wear what he wants than not at all. Don’t let your fiancé decide what you put on your body. 
"Yes, they will break before degloving your finger. Also, for what it's worth my dad is a mechanic and hasn't worn his wedding band in almost 30 years since it touched a battery terminal (I think) on a car at work and it shocked the shit out of him and melted the band. He stuck his hand in water almost immediately but it still burned his finger pretty badly. My mom had to have the band melted down and remade but he doesn't wear it anymore. Everyone understands. When you work with your hands or weightlift like op safety is a legitimate concern that needs to be taken seriously. "
"I really don't get the people in here who are saying you shouldn't work on your health via a diet because she is uncomfortable with it. It's very unfortunate that her mother passed away and I can see why she would be nervous, but her reaction is so closed that it doesn't even give you room to find a middle ground.

Some middle ground could include: 

Working with a dietician to make sure you're not going too extreme.

More regular check-ins with your doctor for the same reason.

Agreeing not to lose more than a certain number of pounds and/or pounds per week.

Making sure that you're getting your full nutrients by tracking your food.

Cooking meals together and getting excited about eating healthy food instead of feeling bad about eating non-healthy foods. This way, the aim is on eating instead of what you don't eat which is what so many diets focus on.

Edit: How does she handles other things relating to her mom? Could there be some unsettled difficulty in accepting her mother's passing?"
"I think the only thing you can do is lay down ground rules to your husband about the level of care you will provide your younger sil when your inlaws become less capable.

Realistically they should have considered this prior to conception but you never know. 

I would also make it clear that you arent going to be doting ""second parents"" either. 

If u lay down ground rules this should offset your anxiety about the future dynamics. The hard part will be enforcing it if it ever happens.

"""Surely there must be some way to communicate without name-calling! If only I knew how!"""
"One suggestion after reading your initial post:

I want you to re-read it and notice the position you seem to consistently place yourself in: victimhood. Things happen to you, you're not in control, you have no choices, no power. Men choose you, you don't choose them ( I mean, REALLY choose. At times your language is passive at best.) Friends do or don't invite you to things, you don't really initiate make relationships happen, they happen at or to you. 

When I find myself in this mindset, I try to reframe my perspective so I'm the hero of my story once more. I reframe my choices going forward to ones where I have power in my relationships, where I have options and strength to achieve my goals. I reassess my choices from before seeing where I abstained from using my hero powers because I was too busy feeling powerless. I don't know if this will help you and in this situation, but in case it does, thought I'd share this little exercise :)"
"Couple points:

This is normally fairly easily treated. If you consider this to be permanent, that's obviously a major issue. Have you pursued any treatment options for this? 

&gt; Usually his climatic moment comes from a blowjob.

Now this is going to be a little harsh, and it's not meant to be, but you might not be very good at giving blowjobs or giving *him* blowjobs specifically. And it might not be your fault. My blowjobs are **awful** because I have a massive overbite and simply can't open my mouth very far. 

My suggestion on improving this is that there is such a thing as ""instructional blowjob porn"", have him find something HE likes, and then watch that and try to emulate. I would do this even if he says ""you're perfect"" because I bet you'll learn SOMETHING new that you haven't thought of. 

&gt; so I feel like it’s definitely psychological and “me” related. I just don’t know why this would have started in the last few months and neither does he

Sexual dysfunction has no clear patterns. This might be the result of pent-up frustration that built-up over time for example. Most men aren't deeply ""in tune"" with their feelings and can't tell you where most of their emotional reactions come from.

"While I believe you that her style might be friendly in the front and a nightmare in the back, her nasty behavior does not directly correlate to your feelings. You are in charge of your feelings. As long as you believe that her nasty controlling manipulative behavior can actually make you feel like shit, she is in control and her way goes. The moment you realize she can huff and puff and do whatever she does and none of that means you have a responsibility to feel anything about it, you regain control over your life with her. "
"And to drive home that I'm not the problem, I'm going to insult my sister over what is probably a very sensitive issue!

Op sounds like a peach."
"&gt; That’s a little harsh on your part.

Not at all. What's harsh was stringing OP along for 8 years when he didn't want to marry her.

&gt; If marrying was so important, why couldn’t you propose?

Because if a guy doesn't want to get married, the solution is to force him by proposing herself. /s

This is terrible advice."

Or she will, just sayin. :)"
"I agree with this, but also consider moving away from the ""haters"". A lot of places don't care, and that fact your present company cares makes them wrong not you. "
"If she’s going to open her mouth, the most she should really say is “Make sure you’re educated on any/all future decisions regarding your children and ensure you’re on the same page.”

No, she should not argue her case or get involved. I am against it as well, I think it’s pointless mutilation. But some people think the same thing about piercings and that doesn’t stop people from getting them or getting their babies ears pierced. Not your kids, not your business and not your problem.

Also, you’re under the impression she’ll want the kid circumcised but that’s an assumption. You have no idea what her actual opinion is. You would be starting drama over something that might not ever have been an issue."
"Can he go for 6 months and you go meet him for a week’s holiday or long weekends here and there? Let’s say 2 months in you meet up for a week, 4 months you go a long weekend somewhere, etc? "
"That’s fucked up. And it sounds like your bf did nothing wrong. Instead of invalidating your feelings, he agreed that his family wasn’t overly welcoming, and told you to give them time. He just came out to his family a few months ago. That’s absolutely valid. 

You took the anger that you had towards his family, and took it out on him. Driving recklessly out of anger is dangerous no matter how in control you think you are. Growing up with brothers is not an excuse for punching your spouse. ..the hell?

And poor thing apologized after YOU punched him. I think that you should leave this poor man alone. He needs therapy, and doesn’t need to be with someone who is still making excuses for their shitty behavior. And it goes without saying that you need therapy also."
I hadn't heard of this before but seems like its actually fairly common as  I research it.

"&gt; Communication is an extremely important factor and that is something which tends to improve with time.

Yes, lots of people enjoy short encounters but those people are *sexually experienced* and capable of showing someone how to get them off. Or taking matters into their own hands. None of which is virgin territory."
I feel extremely petty for upvoting this.
i couldn’t tell if she was a supervisor to the visitations or just a supervisor to the hand-off with the ex
The daughter is already trying to minimize her needs to make it ok that OP is going to let Grandpa come again for dinner. 
"Definitely tell him. Even if he doesn't share your feelings, just knowing that someone loves him will be a tremendous light for him in these final days. By the sounds of it, your love for him seems to transcend just romance. It will be relieving for him to at least know that you care about him so much. Death is a scary thing to face, but it's much less scary when you don't feel alone."

"Yeah, I agree that you're dumb. I also think that you should probably check in your suspcisious behavior and how you defunct to automatically thinking that's something wrong. Do you have trust issues? Then the question for your fiance should she want to be with someone who can't trust her when one thing is out of place? I know that would be a HUGE red flag for me."
"I was going to say no, it's not normal, until I saw this:

&gt;  both of his parents are Chinese immigrants 

This is probably coming from a cultural difference. That doesn't mean you have to put up with it, but might help you see where it's coming from. His parents have probably told him that he won't be happy unless he makes X amount of money. They also might expect him to support them financially - even before they retire. They might even expect to live with you. If you do marry this guy make sure you nail down all these expectations and come to some kind of agreement.

It sounds like you were uninvited because YOU didn't handle your child's tantrum well.  You didn't separate your son from the group so he could calm down and others wouldn't be bothered.  You also attacked your sister and told her to &gt;shut the fuck up and go back to her boy toy

"I’ve taken care of quite a few severely mentally ill people, including a suicidal brother and a best friend with schizophrenia. After devoting years of my life and watching my own mental health deteriorate, I learned that you simply can’t help someone if they don’t want it. I could want the world for my brother, but it wasn’t enough. He killed himself anyway. I could put my friend up in my home, get her insurance, schedule and take her to appointments, but I couldn’t make her take the medication and stop lying to me about it. 

Your wife had a violent episode to avoid going to a psychiatrist. She is refusing help.  It’s ok if you draw the line there and decide to move on with your life without her. 

Some people are toxic and will only drag you down with them. The fact that she is also mentally ill is sad. But she’s still toxic af. "
"If I was throwing up neon signs to a guy that i wanted to take our relationship to the next level and he basically told me that it's too much work to sell his condo and move in with me after 2 years at the age of 35, how could she take you at your word that you want to get married one day?

i mean, you typed it out - it sounds like such a cop out to me. and relationships take work, way more work than putting a condo on the market. not exactly showing you're really vested with your actions here. 

i would start heading to the door too. i want a partner who wants to be with me, not just wax philosophically."

"It is YOUR body. Never, ever feel like you have to make this decision based around another person.  You are the one who would be carrying the child, and you are the one who needs to make this decision.

I understand feeling the need to respond to his desires since he’s the father, but given the way he’s behaving right now, is this the state that you want to raise a child in?
I feel the biggest difference right now may be based around your ages. 31 vs 24 might be at odds about starting a family."
"It’s just wildly, almost ridiculously hard for me to fathom you hearing someone say these things to you - your parents, your sister - and you turning around and calling that person your best friend.

Well the baby's too young to notice whether or not they get a gift. No good will come of going against their wishes. If you give it to them, even if he doesn't make a scene there keep in mind he will probably just throw it away or donate it himself. They are the kid's parents so this is their decision even if you don't agree.  

I would bring the present in just case they have softened up, but leave it in the car. Also bring a simple card as an alternate (so at least there is some sentimental, non-materialistic memento of the holiday). See how it goes, and if they seem to generally be in a mood to acquiesce to taking gifts then bring in the present and sneak it under the tree. If not just put the card under there and donate the snowsuit to charity.  

Hopefully they will get over this as she gets older. But if they don't, remember forcing gifts on the kid can backfire. It's not unheard of for the type of parent that ""doesn't believe in presents"" to make a big show out at home the next morning of making the kid gather up all the presents they got, and drive them down to the donation box and give them all away.  

When they get older if the no presents rule is still in effect, try and give to them by sharing ""experiences"" rather than material items (take them on fun outings, activities) and give them presents that stay at your house/grandma's house to play with rather than to bring home.  "
"The only way it's a joke is if OP is the punchline because he didn't know and probably would say things that resulted in a sweet sense of irony for everyone at OP's expense.

I thought I was going crazy. Would people be responding the same if he was drunk and put his hands on her? Must I would bet would be telling to dump him. It being drugs ain't no different. He put his hands on you. It is irrelevant that he can't remember. 
"No offense OP, but did you do the math? Do you think the 48 year old mother will be incapacitated before she's 68 and the kid is adult? This is a very bizarre reaction."
Wow. He gets alimony and uses it to support the chick he cheated with? And now you are mad the gravy train is gone? Oh hell no. You deserve whatever happens next. Edit: It sucks that this is happening but you deserve no sympathy at all.

"Do you actually not want him there or are just worried about him ""wanting more""?


Tell him that he is a friend, and you are happy to help him with shelter, but that you don't want anything sexual with him. Be clear about it. It sounds like he s ""following you around"" because it's a small space that's lonely and he has nothing else in his life. Sex might just be sex to him and offering a hand job might actually be him trying to say thank you.


But I think you should look into other resources to get him support because he can't stay there for ever. Charities and homeless shelters and group homes and Medicaid or whatever."

I am the mother of two adult children in their early 20s. This advice is 100% correct. The most unhappy parents of adult children I know raised their kids to think they were the most important thing in the world when it should be the opposite. I highly encourage parents to make their needs and boundaries a priority to their kids when they are young or they will regret it when they are older. "
"I don't have any problem getting it.   Agreeing with it is a whole different thing.  My advice was to quit letting his friend draw lines in the sand.  He's 35, he should be able to tell his friend that he's interested in his sister and would like to spend time with her.  "
My mother does the same thing. It's completely intentional. She can't bear to not be at the center of the drama. 
" Jesus.  Your SO actively tried to kill himself,  his mother's reaction was to scream at him that it was his fault then abandon him and you think you 'nuked' his relationship with her?

He needs to get away from her as fast and as far as possible.

He's not there yet. Peace will come after he grieves for and processes what he discovered. OP will never know what it's like to have a mother who loves you fully and unconditionally with all her heart. That fucking hurts. Right now anger and hurt are appropriate and healthy emotions that he should feel comfortable processing. 
"I've anonymously reported someone for child abuse. It's harrowing--it was so rough on me emotionally because it brought up a bunch of stuff from my own childhood, but when I was aware of what the person I reported had done to her child, I couldn't not report. It was a long conversation with the person answering the hotline. I cried a couple of times relating what had happened. The person on the phone was really good about it. I got the feeling it's normal. They asked if I wanted to leave a name and contact details so I could be updated, and I said no, that I just wanted them to know what was going on so that they could intervene and provide support.

I heard through the grapevine afterward that CPS went and talked to them and then there were some interventions of some sort--followup visits, I think, and some therapy for the child and parenting classes for the parents. The parent I reported was apparently very angry that she'd been reported, but fuck her, is my attitude. The child was so young and had no choice in the matter, so the child was my concern. "
"I totally agree, I just wanted to chime in because ultimately the paperwork is whats important and that people will play dirty when it comes to pets."
"I’m assuming that he might try to tar her name among their mutual friends. It’s par for the course for shit bags like her soon to be ex. Better safe than sorry. Hopefully it doesn’t work out that way, but it doesn’t hurt her to have proof on her side. "
"I remember your first post! I'm gladd your family was able to regroup and get things sorted out. You would have been justified to ""take your ball and go home,"" and stay mad and uncommunicative with your parents. You chose the forgiving road instead, and it worked out 😊Communication for the win!

I bet next time you have to make a big decision for yourself, you will get less pushback from your family. You've shown them that their pressure tactics don't work, there's a line they can't cross, AND that you are rationally making the best choices for yourself. Couldn't have worked out better on that front.

Moreover, it was very classy of you to not air out a woman's  dirty laundry while you were in a relationship with her. Inviting the peanut gallery to comment on your relationship whike it was happening would have infantalised you, and would have ruined any chance of a potential spouse from bonding with your family. Nice work👍"
"I would need to see a paternity test after this. 

$1200 is a good chunk of change, it isnt good that he kept you in the dark, and his attitude isnt great. 

He also really isnt answrring why she needs it. How did her finances change? Doctors visits arent usually weekly and there arent loads of things you need when pregnant. She isnt buying diapers and formula each week. If he wants to buy furniture or clothes for the baby why didnt he buy it instrad of a weekly cash withdrawal? If he's funding her christmas, again why is it weekly? Ive been pregnant twice and there isnt a huge change in expenses *before* the baby is born. If she had a newborn, okay, maybe. Pregnant? No.

Its all suspicious to me. I wuestion if the money is going to her and WHY if it is."
"Your son is not at fault for resenting you or your new family because he is a child. He is 100 percent not responsible for any of the circumstances he has found himself in. If the emotional stuff isn't fixed, it's not his fault. If he views your love for him in terms of gifts, that's not his fault either. There are reasons he doesn't like spending time with you. Those are not his fault either. You are the parent. It's your job to step up with patience and understanding. Regardless of anything your ex wife is doing or not doing, punishing this kid for not embracing you and your extended family 100 percent is not the answer. "

"&gt; She's never shown any favoritism in dealing with the kids, but the way she so casually said it ""I have a special connection with Ari because she's mine"" like it was so obvious that it's okay for her to have a clear favorite.

This is a vital consideration. She says this and feels this... *but how does she act toward all the children?* There's no question she'd feel a special bond with her daughter, after all, going through the pregnancy, giving birth and more... she never had the chance to form the same bond with your children, obviously. Despite that, it seems like she's doing what she can for the family unit as a whole.

What should you do? What is there to do, here? She's treating all the children with tenderness and care. You do the same and it will be a loving household twice over."
"That's a good point. Hopefully when she's older she'll understand. That's the part my parents are struggling with too and it makes me so sad. My mom was SO excited to be a grandma, and the fact that she's not allowed around her own granddaughter just breaks her heart. I think this will be best for everyone though."
"Do you feel you're making any progress in therapy? I ask because your anxiety sounds like it's preventing you from managing your life and relationship in a reasonable fashion. As the previous commenter suggested, you seem afraid to express the most basic and reasonable of needs to your boyfriend. And you seem to be suffering from desperately low self esteem.

Do you really think you can handle a baby right now, especially by yourself? You need to prepare yourself for the worst case scenario."
"Unless he's from Columbia, I wouldn't expect him to necessarily be aware of those views in Columbia.  Gay rights in Columbia isn't a hot topic in the queer community.  I don't assume anyone is homophobic unless they say something homophobic.  It's kind of shitty to assume someone will be hateful because of their background.  Obviously he's not blurting it out to her, because you already said he doesn't out himself to MOST PEOPLE.

Regardless, you are ignoring my actual advice that you need to tell him that he's dating your mom.  Most people wouldn't want to date the parent of someone they banged and did coke with, regardless of sexuality or gender, because that's fucked up.  He can break up with her without outing either of you."
"Wanting to follow up with the contacting people, keep your flatmates in the loop. The last thing you want is for him to come by and have one of them let him in, because they didn't know about your decision. Depending on your relationship with them, even talk with them asking for help. Just let them know you want zero contact with him and don't want him around if he shows up. Otherwise stay strong and don't let him worm his way back in."
"Doesn't sound like your deafness is the problem, it just sounds like she's uncomfortable. You could try inviting her to go get coffee or play a board game, and try to bond with her a little more.

This is the best advice here. If it's after Christmas bring around cookies or something. And actually talk to him when you reach his desk. Introduce yourself. Ask about his holiday. And then when you walk by you can say hi. He's not a stranger anymore. And OP will get a bit of a vibe on if he likes him or not.
Why does your family approve of this creepy relationship? Why do you only have one pair of pants? Why are you asking for makeup when you’re so poor you only have one pair of pants? Why are your priorities so out of order?
"While that is true about the sister, she is NOT a safe person to be around right now, since so many women become accomplices and facilitators of abuse at the behest of their partners. She does need help, but for her own security, OP's wife should not be the helper. "
You’d be surprised. This whole story gives off Karla Homolka vibes.

Are you actually regularly choose the dinner selection.  It sounds like you do if you've put it on her that she needs to ""nudge"" you so she can eat the meal of her choice.  Honestly, you do sound very frustrating.  As if her preferences don't matter and she has to actually argue and justify a meal or an elevator."

"I wouldn't say ""morally obligated"". If you don't feel comfortable, don't do it. Reach out to the app developers directly and find out more about the reporting process before doing it - I am sure, whatever the process is, that there wouldn't be a way for him to find out that you were directly responsible for getting him suspended from the app or whatever consequences might occur from him lying about his age, if any.


That said, lying about your age on a dating app isn't a crime. It's just scummy behavior. I'd say you're just as entitled to cut off contact with him, block him on all mediums, and move on."

"We had a similar situation in our family last year, so I understand how you feel. However, when you decided to participate in Secret Santa you accepted the obligation to get a gift for the person whose name you got. But this what I would do. I would get a gift card to my favorite restaurant, put it in a nice card, and then keep it in my purse. If my cousin shows up, I'd slip it under the tree. After all it's Christmas, and I don't want to feel bad about not doing the right thing. Maybe Laura didn't have the money to participate, so she flaked on the whole event. I don't know.  After Christmas, I would invite my aunt out for nice lunch (on her daughter's gift card!) and tell her I know that she bought my brother's gift and what a nice and generous gesture it was. Then we would have a nice time catching up. ( I can totally see my aunt doing this for her flakey son!). As for getting my aunt an additional gift for Christmas, I wouldn't. She bought a gift to cover for her daughter, and that was her choice. This may be part of Laura's problem if her mom is always bailing her out. Lastly, when Secret Santa comes around next year, I would leave Laura's name out of the pool. If she asks why, be truthful, she didn't come last year so you thought she wasn't interested."
"No one gets alimony being married for 6 months.  And it's not gender based, it's based on whether one partner has been the primary earner and the other has stayed home. "
"The most important thing here is that you get proper therapy for the traumas you experienced as a child.

The Christmas stuff...well, you're going to have to tell your BF the truth eventually. You can let him know that you won't be able to make the trip because you don't feel well (which is true) and make time to see him when he's back and explain to him in person what happened. 

With time, maybe you can be well enough to be around her cordially but you are totally not obligated to do so. This woman could very well be a big part of your BF's life and if you envision having a future with him, this is something to keep in mind. "
"Girrrrrllll this was me 4 years ago. Long term boyfriend who was my best friend and who I intended to marry but I'd realised I was 100% gay.

Yes it was awful telling him. He was blindsided by it. Yes it was awful telling my family. They were freaked out. And yeah it stayed grim for a while (about 6 months) afterwards. However it gets better! 

Right now I have that same ex boyfriend texting me to arrange a board game night with him and his girlfriend, and me and my GF. After about 6 months of awkward upset him and I rekindled a really solid friendship. He said that on reflection it was kind of obvious. We'd go for food, to the cinema, museums and stuff. I was thrilled when he met a new gal. He was thrilled for me and so supportive. We still get to enjoy the aspect of our relationship that we're good but turns out we suit being friends far better.

I met an amazing girl and my whole idea of what love was got blown out of perspective. Kissing - amazing! Sex - incredible! That feeling of completeness and absolute comfort - indescribable! Next year she'll be my wife. I was like you also wanting a traditional family and not wanting to share pregnancy. It was one of the things I struggled most with when I came out. I worried I'd never have it. When I fell in love with my girlfriend that all became so much easier. The idea of her children seems far more cute that the idea of my biological kids. I still want to be pregnant first but the thought of caring for her when pregnant seems such an honour now. It took me by surprise how easy that issue seems now.


I can't describe how much richer and happier my life is for coming out. If i could only convey to my past self how happy I'd be in the future it would've saved me a lot of fuss. OP for me it has been worth it in ways I could never have imagined. 

P.s. Get some LGBT affirmative therapy and start meeting people from the queer community. It takes a while but after enough exposure you'll find your place and feel so happy.

"Or she could suck it up and respect her husband's wishes for one night while he's grieving and wants to support his parents.  Jesus, I hope she never expects any type of support from him in the future. As he already pointed out, this is the one thing his mother has asked them for during a difficult time. "
"I think he's not into consensual physical abuse and doesn't want to keep doing it, but instead of telling you that, he's going overboard to show you that it's a mistake. He is putting up with doing it lightly because that's the extent he's comfortable and it sounds like you've repeatedly pressured him to do it after he expressed hesitation."
"If I had a death in the family, I would be PISSED if my spouse did this, I would 100% view them as being selfish and focusing on the wrong thing and making a difficult time even worse. 

Also,  even if the issue is him not having a backbone, this isn’t the time to expect him to start standing up to his parents if that’s not what he wants.  Getting a hotel room for yourself and spending the night somewhere without him is leaving him without support. 

I understand needing alone time, but in the grand scheme of things your personal needs should not come before that of your grieving husband and his family - assuming you have empathy for them - and if you don’t this is the time to pretend you do.  This will be a stressful time for everyone.  Try to plan alone time when you get back, something that will help you relax. Hopefully your husband will be supportive of you needing that too - just at a more appropriate time. "
Good to know I wasnt the only one thinking who'd actually WANT this?
"Why not give him a trip for Christmas? I don't know what your budget is but you could take him to Disney World, Universal, or even out of the country if your budget permits. Maybe he'd love to see Europe? 

Maybe find four days to a week and take him down to Orlando, hit up the amusement parks, do surfing lessons, fun dinners, beach day, etc. Just you and him one on one. It's a big gift but it's also a ton of quality time. "
My heart hurts for your girlfriend. 
She doesn't want to end up feeling guilted into taking care of a disabled teen/adult when her parents die. I thought she made that fairly clear.
"If this is real, you need therapy to treat your PTSD. Just because you ended up safe and physically unharmed doesn’t mean it wasn’t traumatic for you. "
"This is awful. 

Since I imagine you will be around him again because he just “surprise shows up,” try:

1. He says bad comment, repeat bad comment VERY loudly and ask why he said that. 
2. Record your interaction and post it so only family can see on Facebook or text it around.
3. Stay near your husband or his wife. 
4. Ask his wife if something is wrong that he makes these sexual comments. 

I would not waste my holiday on this nonsense next year. Take a break and write your parents a letter with specific examples of his awful comments. You could even layer in some Bible verses about respect and purity. The Bible wants us to forgive but not expose ourselves to crap without good reason. Christmas is not a reason to manage your cousin’s crap. "
"Can you not see how inappropriate it is when you factor in the ""Maybe there's still hope"" line?

I would be immensely, immensely embarrassed if I were you.  Really.  You kind of made a fool of yourself publicly.  Just being honest.  It's very very cringeworthy.  "
I've gone though so much of my life not saying no to them and I need to start learning how to say it. I want to move out at the end of the semester and I will be cutting them off financially no matter how much they whine to me.
That or you try to have sex with virtually everyone on earth.
"But he is crossing a line, and that could cause a problem in your employment later on. "
Apologetic to angry. That’s so key.
That's a really strange and paranoid request. You're fixated on something you made up and latched onto. 
"Thanks, your first paragraph says it all, it starts to get degrading over time"
"My heart is breaking for you. It's one thing to have no one in this world and to receive a kindness from a pseudostranger, which is amazing and kind, *but you don't have no one*. I wonder what this woman would think if she knew you have a partner who had plenty of money and was letting you go hungry. I wonder what your bf's mom would think. I wonder what *your* mom would think. 

If my son's live in partner of 8 years needed handouts from church just to eat while my son took home a 6 figure salary I would smack the ever loving shit out of him. This is downright disgraceful of him. You know you could live in a modest apartment with roommates and actually be able to afford food, right? Living with your partner is supposed to improve both of your qualities of life. How the fuck you are maintaining a PhD in these conditions I don't know. Kudos to you for that."
"Oh man. Many people will not want a long-term partner who feels zero for sex. That is just a fact, and it is important that you understand it so that you can try to find other people to date for whom sex isn't important."
What do you want the outcome to be?
"Absolutely, but not because I am manipulating him. He is crying to get her to have sex!!!"
Especially when you're expecting a baby!
"Staying at a hotel? That seems odd.

Block the ‘friend’ after you tell him to go away because you’re happily married.

DH is overacting a tad. "
A 30 year old man is more than capable of getting out of bed in time. Why is it up to you to keep trying to get him up? Let him be mad and when your home let him know his behavior is unacceptable. My 14 year old brother wakes up himself on time with less fuss than this guy.

"&gt; It sounds like, with your husband taking on most of the expenses and being so supportive, you have the opportunity to try a new career and save a lot of money. That’s a great opportunity, and I encourage you to take him up on his offer! Sign the post nup (after consulting a lawyer) or don’t sign the post nup. But please, think carefully before throwing your career, independence, and future earning potential away.

YES this. I will not for the life of me ever understand why so many american women are just fine with becoming SAHMs without any sort of independent income and security of their own. Relationships end all the time, success or no. Make your own fortune, don't rely on someone else's, because that way misery lies.

He went out on dates with another woman.
This is fucked up on so many levels. The fact that he lied is one. His stealing credit for your hard work is two. His lack of respect for you is three. His lame excuse is just asinine. This guy is a duster.
"In your shoes I would go to counseling and try to work things out. It might not work, but for the sake of your kids it would be a good idea to improve your relationship with their mom/stepmom, regardless of if you stay together. Your PTSD might be a factor in the relationship issues, make sure the couples counselor you see has expertise in that topic, too."
"He also invested his money into paying your Uni tuition (and rent and living expenses?) for 4 years. So rather than being ashamed of him and his “ugly” house, maybe be grateful for how much he has done for you and proud of what a good father he is. I don’t know if your fiancé is shallow and materialistic, but your sort of sound like you are, a little bit. Focus on what’s important, introducing your fiancé to your family, not the house."
"So, you've known this entire relationship that she likes to wear alternative or abnormal clothing and that she does it all the time. Why are you surprised that she continues to do this?"
"I have a friend with two blind parents. He has four siblings. They are all pretty well-adjusted. Blind parenting is totally a thing, but your wife probably has to stop shying away from the ""blind lifestyle"" if y'all decide you want to make it work because you will probably need support and advice from others."
"&gt; Maybe they're insecure about their age and are just feeling lonely and desperate to meet people. Doesn't mean they're somehow dangerous or predatory.

I am pretty sure there are a bunch of 40-something year old women available."
"I mean, all you really said about her attitude specifically towards you was:

&gt;and she is not very pleasantly 

You didn't really specify that she is flat out mean to people who don't wear makeup, mainly just that her interests involve her looks and status."
"&gt; He's also commented about how it's a shame cheating women don't get stoned to death anymore.

WTF. And did you ask him what the punishment for cheating men (*cough cough* DOUG *cough*) should be?

&gt; The last straw was when I texted him I would working late and he told me to send him a picture of myself at work so he had proof of where I was. I asked him why he didn't trust me and if Doug had been saying I was cheating and he said he felt I had been distant lately and that Doug had told him to watch out. 

Oh, so you have a boyfriend problem. This isn't just that Doug's a paranoid, embittered assmonkey. Your boyfriend is a weak-willed compatriot in Doug's fevered delusions. He should be shutting down Doug. *""Not everyone cheats like you and Amy, brother dear.""* Instead your boyfriend's thinking, *""Oh yeah, maybe my long-time girlfriend who's never given me any reason to worry is a cheating monster and my brother, a notorious shitbag with a horrible wife to match, is TOTALLY RIGHT ABOUT HER!!!!!""* Of course you're mad. How are you even still in this relationship!

&gt; At one point he even said ""hey who are you texting?"" and grabbed my phone OUT OF MY HAND. Sam and his parents never said anything other than a mild ""hey Doug leave her be"".

Not fucking good enough. Your boyfriend does not have your back. It's one thing to not defend you against verbal attacks and another to treat you shabbily without justification, but he's letting his brother steal your property out of your hands to spy on you and he isn't doing anything other than meekly requesting he stop? Fuck no.

You are much more patient than I am. So many deal-breakers.

"Traditionally, rings are viewed as a symbol of mutual commitment and love. 

A collar, traditionally, is viewed as a symbol of enslavement and one person having ownership over another. 

And it isn't closed minded at all, it's being respectful. Of OP's feelings, and of other people's too. Nobody needs to know what OP and his partner do in the bedroom except OP and his partner.  

Think what you want about marriage, but this isn't YOUR marriage, and your opinion isn't helpful to OP. "
"Yeah, I was just pointing how saying ""I don't want to marry YOU ever"" will not come across well at all. Because that's how it will come across if he says it like that, she'll think that he doesn't love her. 

I just think saying ""I don't want to get married"" is better than saying something such as ""I don't want to get married to you"""
"Because she's terrified to leave? I don't know anything about this kind of thing but I wonder if the yelling thing is just something he does when company is over, and if he escalates to verbal abuse or even violence when there are no visitors? Or maybe not, and she stays because if she leaves and doesn't get 100% custody, that means her children would still be subjected to this behaviour, but she wouldn't be around to comfort her children or make sure he doesn't escalate to violence?"
"His fetish is his fetish, regardless of how weird anyone thinks it might be.

What's more alarming here is that he isn't respecting a boundary you've stated, sexual or not. You stated you didn't want to take part in the fetish and he berates you until you break down and let him. You tried it, you didn't like it and you don't want to do it again. There's nothing wrong with that.

I would break up with him, not for his fetish but because he disrespected boundaries that I specifically stated. Also, I'm not of the mind that there's a wrong time to break up with someone... If you're done - you're done. Don't keep in this because it's his birthday. If he wanted to keep the relationship, he should have respected you."
Or just bought a bed and had it set up in the living room.
"I would never suggest a boyfriend get a vasectomy if he wasn't already adamant about not wanting kids. But OPs boyfriend is, so there should really be no harm in asking if he'd look into it. If he doesn't want to, the discussion is over, but for childfree women that can easily become a dealbreaker issue at some point, so it's worth addressing the feasibility now. "

You could only get it from a blow job if she has oral herpes as well (and actually like 95% of people have oral herpes, it’s possible but rare for them to spread to the genitals through oral sex.) The fact that she has genital herpes has no connection to whether she has oral herpes, you’re not more likely to get herpes through a blow job with her than you would be with any other random girl."
"&gt; Should I be concerned she doesnt realise it was someone asking her out?

"From the poster above you:

&gt;as wrong as incest is, she's 19. 

Five years ago she wasn't. And this ""mysterious little brother"" apparently was born only a few months after you left.

Pedophilia and child molestation is a crime in all states and federally. Incest is also a crime in *all* states, the only state where this would not be considered criminal from an incest angle is Rhode Island due to the statute mostly dealing with incestuous marriage.

Posting just to clarify: if that ""younger brother"" is more than a 50% genetic match for your Ex, then there was absolutely a crime committed. If you suspect a crime, you should report it to the police. The police couldn't find anything before but the ""younger brother"" may himself be evidence.

If my boyfriend were in a situation like that, he might tuck his friend into bed and talk her down, then bring another female friend into the room to comfort her and promptly allow them some privacy.

If my boyfriend snuggled and spooned and cuddled another girl while she was in her underwear and his hoodie, I would never be able to trust him to know proper boundaries ever again."
"Yes. She owes you nothing and whether you know she's pregnant tomorrow or next month will affect you in no way. You just want her to do this to satisfy your own curiosity.

"Have you talked future ambitions or career paths with him? Maybe spend some time sitting down with him and exploring some plans for the future, whether that's a trade, programming, or hell, even some sort of craft or creative pursuit would be better than playing games all day.

A lot of this lies on your parents as well. If your parents continue to financially enable him without any consequences, then he really has no motivation to get off his ass and get a job. "
I remember having this issue and occasionally still do with my younger brother. The thing about bullies who are siblings is you can't let them think you are scared of them. I have friends who also have this issue but I personally have to crush him in some type of way and establish that he isn't much outside the family. This might not be helpful at all but what I am saying is that if you always walk on egg shells and take that shit you will always have this issue. My two cents.
That's a terrible idea.
"It's so hard because she was doing so well for a few years. She was someone who was addicted to coke for a long time and she overcame that, went back to school and started to make something of her life with my grandma's support. Something happened to her medically last year and she has been milking it for all its worth. Now I feel like she's back to her old ways (not sure if its drugs). But I've caught her stealing cash from my purse numerous times even when I thought she was doing well so who knows... I really want her to go back to how it was a couple years ago. All I know is that this needs to stop. I will definitely put a freeze on my account and talk to my grandma about it."
"I'm going to be harsh because everyone else has been nice so I don't need to be. If I was your boyfriend, especially given his position on the matter, I'd break up with you. You just have no understanding of emotional boundaries in a way that would be compatible with someone who has emotional scars from infidelity. You are coming off as extremely insensitive to him and he's right. All you seem to care about is how good this guy makes you feel. Lots of guys are going to make you feel good it is up to you to reject these guys and be emotionally faithful to your guy. As it stands you seem like a flirtatious ""innocent"" type who secretly enjoys the attention. End it with the coworker please or at least let your boyfriend find a woman who understands his boundaries. "
"Your discomfort isn't about sex. It's about the fact that your boyfriend is blatantly hypocritical and you are having a hard time reconciling that with the idea you have of him being a good man. 

He is *not* a good man. Unless he's sleeping with men, his 'playboy' ways were furthered on by women. And now he deems women less than as if they are somehow tainted? "

"That's how I feel. After being together 8 years, I certainly wouldn't want to watch as my partner struggled while I live comfortably. I can't even fathom that. "
"Honestly, I wouldn't be okay with it. If I am watching something with someone, I want to watch it with them. I don't want to have to be completely conscious of hitting pause exactly when the sex stops or having to explain something that's plot relevant or whatever. It would honestly distract me and make it harder to focus on the show. Particularly something like Game of Thrones that has sex scenes that also affect the plot pretty majorly.

Are you kidding?


You don't think you not enjoying sex isn't a big hurdle for any partner of yours?

"Yes, platonic friends can do dinner and a movie. Plenty of them do. 

I do think it's inappropriate to talk too much about your relationship problems to friends. There's a balance there: it's important to have people to turn to for emotional support and advice, but then venting to others can undermine your own relationship or turn them against your partner, especially if you only talk about the negative aspects of your relationship and don't give a balanced picture. And if there's any sexual or romantic tension, then relationship problems can be a slippery slope. But just because she's the opposite sex didn't mean there's an attraction there."
"I did have the talk. Several times. I asked him to marry me and he said the man was supposed to propose and not the other way round so I had to wait until he proposed. He said he would propose when he was ready. But then he gave me no indication as to when it would be. Even after 8 years and living together for 4 years. We had talks about it but he just said later. He told me it might be 8 more years or longer before he was ready and I would just have to wait. I didn't care about an expensive ring or a big white wedding, I would have done it no ring at the courthouse. But all he did was tell me he would do it when he was ready, whether it was months or years away and I would need to wait until he decided. I wanted to have kids too but he refused to even think about that because we were not married and he wouldn't have a child outside of marriage. So he might not be ready for marriage until I am past my fertile years but in the meantime no kids until we were married. He told me with science I could still have kids in my 50s and 60s so there was no rush and he had not decided to be married yet.

I'm super supportive of nonmonogamy, but his inability to acknowledge the emotional profundity of his relationship with this other girl and his attachment to her, even if it's nonsexual, is not super sustainable for anyone involved simply for the reason that he is clearly making her a large priority in his life in a way that's uncommon when you're still going through the honeymoon phase of a new relationship.

Idk, if you've already brought it up reasonably and patiently and he refuses to at LEAST acknowledge some deep platonic feelings for her, that's sort of uh... emotional constipation at best, and that's a red flag in and of itself."

"If she is a mother figure or stepmother, there is no reason why she should be a secret and no reason for you not to meet her, and not to have met her. 

If she is the mother of a child of his, this is definitely not something that should be a secret, particularly since he would owe child support, be bringing over groceries, possibly having the kid over, etc. 

If she is an ex and he got attached to a child that was not his, again, potentially shady or potentially fine were this not a damn secret. 

So in any event, you need to blindside him. Simply let him get settled and ask, ""Who is mom?"" If he acts flustered, give the ring back. If he has a rational explanation, you meet her now. If he has some rational explanation that can't be summarized in one simple sentence, but involves lots and lots of words, or your gut screams bullshit, give the ring back and have a back packed so you can walk.

3. Keeps you isolated from others

4. Manipulates you into thinking you’re the bad one when you’re actually the victim

5. Pressures you into sex and belittles you when you refuse due to a legit medical condition 

It’s not fair to you or your son to stay with this guy. "
"To be perfectly frank, he shouldn't even be doing the positive aspects of this that are boundary pushing. When I read that he was staying up until midnight to help the OP write a paper, my shoulders went up around my ears. Someone who is that willing to have no boundaries in terms of helping, it's only a matter of time until they start crossing those boundaries in far more injurious ways. "
"you've brought up a good point with the fingering. it makes me realize i should never tolerate anything i don't actually enjoy, worse if it makes me feel uncomfortable just because i want him to feel good. and it does make me question why he would want to keep doing something that he knows i don't like. i literally am frozen and waiting for it to be over while he tries to relax me. gosh, typing that makes me feel so embarrassed and dumb. "
"Yes, I saw that post! It was very much about dominating and like almost disrespecting or dehumanizing a woman. Really put me off anal sex for life, so good job guys, my boyfriend would love to thank you for that."
"While I agree with you in theory - I'm a big proponent of letting the person subjected to any assault define it for themselves. She knows it's assault and how she chooses to say it 'sexual assault, sodomy, rape' etc should be her choice. 

I think her power has already been taken away enough. If she wants to define it as rape that's her decision. But it's not ours. "
"Oh please. Dude, she's emotionally abusing you and gaslighting you. Come on now. Just break up with her. "
"Getting married next year, picked a month, chose the specific date based on the availability of the venue. Unless there's some symbolic reason for it or you need to arrange it based on other people's schedules, there's no good reason to be nitpicky about dates."
"It's not just about dating, you're asking about his sexuality. This man is essentially a stranger to you, you have NO IDEA how he would react. There are many people in this threat saying hey would be very creeped out and go to HR in this situation. Seriously, in what way is an anonymous note with an unknown number asking about someone's sexuality appropriate? 

Even if we take out the whole asking his sexuality part, it's still SO WEIRD. It could be any question, and I would still find it strange. Some random person who is maybe a coworker left a note with no name, just a supposedly untraceable number, asking me something? It's unprofessional and inappropriate. You sound incredibly immature. "
Breaking anyone else’s things on purpose is not ok. Kids learn this in preschool
Don't take this the wrong way but I'm her age and would never date a 19 year old. Are you sure she's interested in someone that much younger/in a different life phase than she is?
"Recreational drug user here to give you a +1. 

There are literally people  above this arguing over which drug it was like it makes a damn difference."
"I suck high time at gift giving, whereas my BF puts a lot of thought into it. Guess what, I make the effort to do something he will like because it matters to him. He's really easy going about everything else in life, but he cares about gifts (even if they come way late), so I match his efforts. 

This year, as we have been dating for nearly 4 years, I did try to skip on Xmas gift to him as I thought he was doing the same with me. I probed around it and found out I was not going to get mine on time because of shipping issues, and when he asked me about mine I looked like an ass. So I will definitely get him something he will love. 

I feel ashamed because in my previous relationship (12 years) I did the same thing to my ex, and I had promised I'd be thoughtful with my current BF. I realised I am getting into the ""taking the other for granted"" trap and I don't want to. 

Long story short, if it matters to you she should have made an effort. Thing is, you are married and won't go anywhere if she doesn't, so we tend to get lazy with those things. If this is the only thing where she's inconsiderate, I'd tell you to think that maybe habit and marriage made her sort if blind to the issue here.  "
"I do agree about the company aspect of this. Problem is, he's saying he doesn't want to ""lose too much money"". So he's not really taking about the company, rather THEIR (they are married, the money is equally his and hers) money. Should they divorce right now, she would get half the money. I assume this post-nup is written in a way that she would get significantly less money, and her husband would walk away with practically everything. Considering he's convinced her to leave her job, she could be in a huge financial mess because of this. 

I don't necessarily think the post-nup is a terrible idea considering his company and he should be able to retain that in case of a divorce, but the way he explained it seems very sketchy. She definitely needs her own lawyer to look at it and make any necessary adjustments so he can't screw her over. 

Personally, I'd be pretty hurt if my husband came to me with something like this. OP is obviously upset that he doesn't trust her, and it's probably best they go to marriage counseling. "
"I am one of the people who believe her emotional affair is... not justified, but understandable. 

And damn do I agree with you. She was absolutely having an affair! She made sure to have phone calls with him without her husband around and even went to a hidden messaging app after telling him she would stop. 

Personally, cheating is when you are hiding something from your partner. She was cheating on OP. 

However, I completely understand where she was coming from. She was talking to someone on the phone 2 hours out of the day and OP himself says that was more interaction then he was getting. That in itself shows you how little he paid attention to her and it went on for years. She was probably longing for attention and found it. It also sucks that OP tried to have a redo before and went back to his old ways, so his wife has no way of knowing whether it would stick this time around. She could take him at his word but I'm sure his word means nothing to her at this point. 

They need to both stop fucking around and go to marriage counseling or they just need to cut the bullshit and end it."
who hurt you bb
" My oldest brother in law *hates* me. I mean, viciously. He is cruel and rude and just plain awful to me. 

I don't speak to him but I don't stop my husband from doing so (though my husband isn't his biggest fan either). It works out fine. 

Your fiancé can have a relationship with his brother that doesn't include you. There's nothing wrong with that."
"Well having an affair with someone MARRIED and 30 years your senior (and calling it lovely) indicates a very serious problem. I'm not a therapist and most people here aren't but clearly you have issues. 

"
"The very next day your mom is heading to FL for a month--she's busy with last minute details and with getting her hair/nails done so she looks fresh for her vacation. I get that you're disappointed, and I'm sorry. but, she has her own life and driving 4 hours round trip to exchange some gifts isn't really convenient for her. Maybe you could drive to see her and take them out to dinner after the appointments? Or wait until Feb for an extended holiday. "
"Even if he isn’t forcing you, this sounds insanely controlling. Wear what you like. "
"I think that it's really creepy and probably a really bad idea. It's possible, but unlikely, that this is a good relationship. Are they on the same level financially? Will she continue working and have the means to support herself? Does she ever want kids? Do they have plans for when he retires? What type of social life do they have? Any common friends...are their friends comfortable with this? Is she losing her social life for him (at 24 I would have felt really awkward hanging out with a 55 year old). 

Try to talk to her and ask her some of these questions. Make sure that she's actually thinking about the future.


That being said, I think your parents should get to know him. They don't have to support the relationship, but they should support their daughter. If this ends up being a train wreck, she's going to be afraid of ""I told you so"" and might feel like she has nowhere to go. If her parents are supportive the whole time, she might have more strength. 


As her sibling, be there for her. try your best to make sure that this guy doesn't cut her off from a support network and that she doesn't give up things like work and friends for this guy."
You may want to read a book called Stop Walking on Eggshells. Your mom sounds like she might have a mental issue. It’s so out of the range of normal to rage for days over this. It doesn’t sound like she can handle you having other relationships at all.
"Do they have any pets? Maybe if she had a little dog or cat to care for it would take up some of her time and help her feel like she has a purpose again? 

My MIL is going through this and she got a cat and seems to be doing much better. Sometimes a life of always caring for other people can seem hollow once those other people don't need care anymore. "
"She is in no way saying you aren't important to her. You admitted that you guys have drifted a bit and don't see each other as often. You may feel that you are still as close as normal, but she may not. She may feel closer to these other girls in the bridal party than you.  That's allowed. I'm sorry your feelings are hurt, but you shouldn't expect or assume you'll be in someone's bridal party as it only leads to disappointments if you're not.

Try to think of the positive -- Being in a bridal party comes with work and money, none of which you have to do. You get to come to the party, &amp; have a fun time."
"&gt; break in through the ceiling and aggressively announcing that he would not leave

Sounds like a break in to me. He doesn't live there anymore, and having lived somewhere previously is not license to come back and break in through the ceiling. If you move out of the marital home during a divorce, you surrender your right to live there. Happens in divorce proceedings literally every day, not exactly an uncommon occurrence. Otherwise it would be legal for your crazy ex to break into your house whenever they want to harass you. This is why lawyers tell you not to move out when you break up, because that's you giving up your tenancy there."
"Ha, I hear what you're saying, but it's all legal. It's a converted old furniture factory, that's been split into multiple units (I think thirty in this building?). It's owned by a property management company. We've had regular fire inspections since the warehouse fire in Oakland a year ago, and the sprinkler system's been checked and updated."
Don't beat yourself up for it? Yeah sure we can pin point what would of been part of the cause but at the end of the day she chose to abandon her husband with a new born for 5 weeks without saying anything. PPD doesn't give you a get out jail free card for that sort of behaviour. 
"What if he's more aware than you think, and is dropping those statements to try and begin some sort of conversation?  It's a doofy strategy but I can totally see that being what he's doing"
"&gt;we're moving to different places when we start work

Ding."
"What? Finish your thought. SPEAK UP, BOY!"
I don't know WHY I haven't thought to do this. Thank you! Very smart idea.
Jitterbug phone for Christmas. 
"&gt; I would love to have a relationship with my mom and sister, but I feel like it can't be a healthy one and I don't know what to do. 

You need to scale back these relationships until they're manageable for you. You need to secure your own oxygen mask first. Have you ever been to therapy? I have a very toxic, selfish mother and a belligerent sister. I keep them both very far away from me physically and emotionally so I can live my own life and have a chance at happiness. 
"
"He might be getting enjoyment out of this, since it sounds like his behaviour has escalated over time. The 2 coworker's chatting wouldn't happen to be women, would they? Some (gross) dudes get sexual satisfaction out of making women feel uncomfortable. If so, it's an HR issue."
"That might be the issue. I fancy the arse off my boyfriend and often fantasise/daydream about him, when I'm not with him I think about him, when I'm around him I want to touch him, I love his smell, love just being next to him and sleeping cuddled to him. But also I want to be intimate. I would like to have sex most days (time/energy/health permitting obviously) if I could. 

It's just... After 3 months at your age, physical restrictions aside, you should be pawing at each other. Not tolerating each other like pensioners. Are you even attracted to each other or do you just want the emotional security of a relationship, and you tolerate sex? Cos if I found out my boyfriend was gritting his teeth and tolerating me (and lying about it), I would feel hella rapey, not to mention incredibly misled and heartbroken.

As someone who used to be a therapist (and was specialising in relationships with an aim to focus on psychosexual therapy/ libido mismatch), I would say - please see a therapist."
Jesus. Do you think you even could continue a relationship with your boyfriend? 
Even if it wasn't for the $500 worth of makeup i'd break up with him over the fact he's making YouTube trendy videos and said his frat boys thought it was savage.
"I dont believe it was shrooms, since he'd have to have eaten them and they literally taste like feces. He would recall doing that. Seems more like meth or coke to me (or something he thought was coke). He doesn't sound like he was hallucinating, more like being  aggressive and paranoid."
"I’m sorry, this is climate-change-denial level over here. For every one scientist you bring out, I can bring out 10,000 to refute this.

You came here for advice, and you seem to be very resistant to anything that doesn’t fit your narrative already. You’re wrong, period. "
"Here's some advice: if you take people for granted, they'll get sick of your shit really quickly.

You fucked up. *You*. Your wife is having an emotional affair with someone? At least someone gives a damn about her, and shows it.

The fact that it took a decade for you to even somewhat pull your head out of your ass shows more that she has endless patience than any virtue on your part.

But it's awful nice for you that you can now flip the narrative. Now you can pretend to be the poor, aggrieved victim of infidelity, instead of a callous jerk who ignored his wife for years.

This is all so gross. "
"I think the thing you've been doing wrong is maintaining an in-group culture of messaging rudely to one another as a matter of course, so there is no way to tell when someone is *actually* upset with you.

Texting is a flat-affect communications medium, meaning that there's no inflection, no body language, no cues at all beyond the absolute content of the text.

If you want clear communications with people, don't use a medium that makes it difficult to communicate clearly.  If you want to know when someone really is or is not upset with you, don't regularly have interactions using language that sounds like you *could* be upset with one another, such that when someone actually *is*, there's no way to tell."
This plan! Do the best of all of it and stop telling her everything. 
Unless you are on meth..
"I don’t necessarily begrudge people their preferences. I get finding certain physical features and aspects of certain cultures attractive and being drawn to them. That said I have a hard time understanding people who  unequivocally write off large swaths of population. They are so many types of different black guys and white guys and Asian guys, that to say point blank I would never date X seems weird to me. 

People of a particular race can typically tell when they are being fetishized. So if your friend is doing that she’s likely only hurting herself. It may not be an issue if she’s just looking to get laid, but if she’s looking for something deeper, she’s going to need to be able to connect with an individual and treat that person as a person and not black guy X. "
"To be honest, it sounds to me like you have depression, and should try and work through that before making any majorly life-changing decisions like breaking up with your partner of 11 years. If possible, you should talk to a doctor or therapist. Feeling unmotivated, unfulfilled, and like you don't care about anything can be big warning signs for depression.

One thing that stood out to me is that it feels like you are putting a lot of pressure on her to make you happy or fulfill you, because you don't want to or cannot put the effort in yourself. For example: 

&gt; I spend most of my day alone at home working and when she comes home I want to have a fulfilling conversation but it's just her watching some idiot on YouTube talking into his phone for ad revenue, or we'll eat and she'll ask me about my day and I'm like, well, let's see, I sat in front of the computer for ten hours just like yesterday, how about you? 

How are *you* contributing to having fulfilling conversations with her or are you just wanting her to do it? She's asking you about your day. If you want to have a fulfilling conversation, steer it that way after she asks you about that. "
I think she’s is trying to have sex with you to hurt your brother. She’s a terrible person and your brother should know about it.
"Who even thinks of things like that? No one’s dying for anybody. This isn’t a soap opera!

It sounds like she wanted her wife to fully commit 100% of her time and energy to only her, at all times, for the rest of her life. I can see why their marriage is on the rocks, and OP has nothing to do with it."
"That's not a male perspective, it's just your perspective. You're quite quick to judge too."
"Your gf is stressing herself out to the point she's creating these symptoms.  If she's having her period she's not pregnant.  The end.  Also you don't have a full understanding of pre cum.  And being ""emptied the week before"" makes no sense.  You and your gf both need to be more educated honestly."
"I want to preface this by saying that I don't think you should necessarily give into her fully.

A little bit of tough love here. You kind of dropped the ball here. You told your sister a year ago that you have given special roles to your other siblings, and your wanted one for her as well, but you didn't have one yet. So, she's been sitting there for a year, with a still as yet unassigned role. She's probably thinking that you've changed your mind, or that you care about your other siblings more than her. So she comes up with an idea for something that is passionate about, and you want to reject her outright without a backup role in mind.

No matter what you do, you need to come up with what role you want her to play immediately. You can't reject her offer after leaving her hanging for over a year without a backup.

I do have an idea that could solve both. What if you were both to sing a duet together? Nothing serious, very tongue in cheek about sisterhood or friendship. Something that people would find cute or have a good laugh with you both instead of at her alone.

But when you're assigning special roles to each of your siblings based on their talents, this is her talent. She might not be very good at it, but this is what she does. So it's not a surprise that she thought this would be as perfect fit for you both."
"they've already noticed. Her son is trying to tell dad to buy presents for her.

Also she tried solving it and his response was to intentionally be an obtuse jerk and make her feel like crap

It kinda sounds like he likes the way things are right now"
":( I have binge eating issues, but that gives me some serious perspective on how bad they could be."
"Yeah really, I'm surprised how callous the comments are. 

From the limited info OP sounds like kind of a shit person. She came to this conclusion *up to a year ago* and now wants to ruin Christmas for an entire family because of her indecisiveness and procrastination. 

She can suck it up and say she's too sick to make it to the Christmas party or make up some other excuse."
"Adulthood is taken, not granted. If her going against their wishes ""ruins"" their relationship, they clearly don't have much of one. Sadly though you can't make this decision for her."
I think you are gonna have to let your mother figure out that her husband is pushing her kids away from her. It will be on her to do something about that.
"Have you *been* that kid? I get that you're upset but... This isn't about you. I never had a step father growing up, but my dad was incredibly shitty. And I had to watch my brother, my little brother time and time again be disappointed and let down by our dad, and he still idolised that man. You have to give it time dude. Yeah it sucks but it's now things are. My brother and dad aren't close and I could best describe their relationship as indifferent these days. Just give it time."
"Yup. Definitely more than drugs. This guy has serious problems that he needs addressed, and I'm fervently glad that nothing more happened that night, because he sounds like a ticking time bomb.

I know a lot of comments have already said it, but it bears repeating from another person adding their voice to the pile: this is *not* your fault. Imagine a friend came to you about this situation. You wouldn't think it was their fault, right? I know it's easier to say than it is to believe, but you didn't do anything wrong here, I promise you. "
"If you are in a mature committed relationship, this would be fucked up. However, as you are with someone who isn't taking the relationship as seriously as you are, as long as he does this and will not stop, your nature of your relationship will remain silly.

&gt; His excuses: 1) I was high on drugs 2) I need to make friends

This is just stupid irresponsible shit. Hence OP, do you remember a time when you were peaceful and single? How there wasn't any bullshit like this in your life? Consider that going to back to being single is better than tolerating his horseshit."
"&gt; ""well you can pay me his rent each month and then I won't have to sublet"" or ""well would you rather me move in with a different one of your exes?""
To which I would have responded: Sister, are you seriously putting the requirement of a renter to either be me or someone I've slept with? That's pretty creepy. I know for a fact that there are plenty of decent people looking for a place to live whom I do not have a previous past with. 

In all seriousness it sounds like maybe your sister is a bit bitter or upset about you moving out, it probably being very convenient for her to get the extra cash and still not having to live with a stranger. With that being said, hopefully her not wanting to live with a complete stranger is why she would reach out to your ex, and not some weird plan of getting you two back together again. 
Unfortunately there is nothing you can do to force her to not have him live there. Just make it clear that you will not be visiting that often as long as he lives there and if she cares about that maybe she will reconsider by herself. "
Does that really matter? Not to be insensitive but downs syndrome people need to be helped not until they are 18 but possibly until they pass away. 
"You really are only need to change the sister's flight. Kick her to the curb, make her change her flight or stay in a hotel. That'll probably do wonders for morale in your home the next few days. "
"Hi, I’m also a high-functioning autistic woman, around your age. I’m also a mom. 

There are definitely challenges when it comes to parenting with autism, like the sensory issues, but there are also advantages. Because of my autism, I find it really easy to stay calm when small mishaps occur, while so many of my friends who are parents as well tend to get stressed out easily. And I’m a lot more pragmatic than the majority of moms that I know. I don’t feel like I’m at any disadvantage compared to any other parents. Every parent ends up doing stuff that works for them and their child, regardless of any medical issues they might have - autism, depression, diabetes, whatever. 

Furthermore, even though I fully expected to pass on autism to my son and had moments when I felt scared about it, he is neurotypical. There aren’t any guarantees when it comes to having a kid! Your mom seems like she’s got some odd ideas about how people on the autism spectrum live their lives, and how they can have perfectly happy family lives just like others. "
"Perfect! Then tell your mom to eat shit, you obviously have this sorted out and though it will be difficult, it’s manageable and it’ll be ok. Best of luck and congratulations!!"
"You may not be able to control what CPS does, but you can control your own actions. It's really your duty as an aunt to protect your niece and do what's best for her -- that would be calling CPS.


What happens if your niece grows older and she finds out what you knew what type of environment she was living in, yet did nothing? As someone who grew up in an abusive household, I still hold resentment for all of my family for doing nothing. 

Even if the call itself does nothing, the fact that you did it in the first place matters. Besides that, it's just your godmother's assumption that they won't do anything, not fact -- and you being willing to call in the first place sets the precedent that people are willing to step in on your brother if he won't act like a good father. 


&gt; unless the child is in danger (her bedroom and the bathroom are the only ""Clean"" rooms in the house. 

You're only considering the hoarding aspect of this. 


Having a parent that is mentally unstable and not taking their medication is a danger to any child as well.

"DO NOT WINK

Damn, how thick are some people?  In this day and age any action that can be misconstrued can/will ruin a career.  A wink may be given as innocent but all it takes is one person to find it inappropriate and now HR is getting involved."
"THIS. My grandparents had a seemingly perfect marriage. Two kids they adored, a nice house, great relationship with each other, a boat, a horse for my mom, vacations. Then my grandfathers business tanked. A few years later they were divorced."
"People can be racist without being explicit. 

Did your family say why they didn't like him? "
Tell her if your kids started biting at each other you'd crate them too lol
"I initially wanted to write it off as a dude trying to awkwardly strike up conversation and bridge the age gap, but I think you really hit the nail on the head with the manipulation tactic. The fact that he's talking to this woman he doesn't even know like it's a surprise that she can operate at above the level of a 15 year old but is in a relationship with her cousin that's the same age? There are several different conclusions you can draw from that and none of them are good.

He either doesn't think much of his GF and wasn't expecting much of her cousin by association, or he doesn't think much of women their age and preys on the easily manipulated, which seems much more likely."
"Find a new roommate option so she can move out. This isn’t sustainable until August in my opinion. 

Next time there needs to be a talk, beware of being ganged up on. Inviting in another neutral party or finding ways to assert yourself might help. For example, meet in a public place to talk or make B write down her requests. She might see how silly they are. Or she won’t, but it will be easier for you to respond. "
"You need to scoot back in time about 6 months and dump this guy, because he's literally declared that he could never deal with living more than 30 minutes away from Mommy and Daddy. That's a *huge* red flag, even though the guy is nice, and loving, and will be a great father. Obviously you can't move back in time, so you need to have a serious talk with this guy *now* that results in, ""It's time for us to either break up, or you adjust your mind to the notion of not living next to your mom and dad, and you move out and get a place with me."" Seriously, this is ultimatum time. You aren't going to be making a marriage work if you're in an attached portion of their house. That'd just be delaying the ultimate misery and divorce. So either way, you and he would both be single parents sharing custody. Best to just start things out that way if he can't get his shit together."
"""With friends like you, who needs enemies,"" has never been a more appropriate saying."
You sound jealous and controlling.  He didn't answer his phone and you accused him of cheating?  He rejected a proposition and you're moody and freaking out and asking the internet for advice?  
"&gt; He begged you not to leave him?

Apparently, all he knows is emotional manipulation. He's still trying to do it, completely unable to recognize that she isn't swayed by it."
This guy is creepy and you absolutely have dodged a bullet.  Go NC and move on with your life.
"You don't need to mention this at all. The only thing you should say is if someone inquires about a it that your relationship was rocky and you aren't sure it would've lasted if she had lived, but that you love your daughter very much. If a future partner pries for more information, you can tactfully talk about the fact that there was a lot of stress in the relationship when she was pregnant and you two had discussed divorce. 

At some point you'll need to have a conversation with your daughter, but please, don't tell her you hated her mother. Please never mention those words to anyone, ever, it will be very rough on your daughter. I would just say that you two weren't a good fit and had mutually discussed divorce, but of course it is devastating for you to have your daughter go through her life without a mother. Always reinforce that you love your daughter, and that regardless of any of this information you mourn the loss of your daughter's mother. "
"Yes, most people figure spoiled brats are kids or at most teenagers. It's hard to accept grown adults can be entitled, selfish, immature spoiled brats too.  Unfortunately, your MIL is just that.  Doesn't make sense, as she's in her 50s but that's what you've got there.  Just as you don't keep enabling a 9-year old spoiled brat, you don't keep enabling a 50+ year old spoiled brat either, as it gets you nowhere and makes them worse.  You have the right, as mature adults, to look at your budget and give gifts accordingly.  You cannot afford her idea of gifts, and that's perfectly okay.  If she can't handle that, too bad. That's on her, not you.  Stop trying to fix it or make it better for her.  It won't work.  I wouldn't spend Christmas with somebody like that.  Stay home and spend Christmas with each other, making your own family Christmas traditions.  Don't reward her shitty behavior.  She can mope alone."
"You haven’t opened anything yet, right?

Wait until the actual day everyone opens presents before saying anything just in case. There is a chance she said she didn’t get you anything because she got you some surprise that can’t be wrapped and put under a tree. It is a very slim chance, but still wait and see what happens.

Then, after presents are opened if you didn’t get anything talk to your partner alone. Say “I wasn’t expecting big things for me and baby, but it was a little awkward to see one set of grandkids recognized and not the other. Is there something going on that you are aware of that could explain this. 

But do wait until they open presents just in case. "
I think that your best bet would be to talk to a divorce lawyer. The lawyer will be able to give you the best advice as well as your options as far as custody and the divorce is concerned.
"Everything you just wrote about him tell us he’s a jerk, an ass, a horrible husband, the list can go on and on. "

"Your sister never intended to pay you for it. If she had, she would have been forthcoming about paying you as soon as you showed her the list of parts.

You could take her to the small claims court, but lose any relationship with your sister or nephew going forth. If you want to maintain a relationship with them, you'll have to let go of the money, or any expectation of ever receiving it. But you would be 100% in your rights to never give her a present or loan ever again."
"That's already a thing video wise. There are just as many ""girl friend breaks Xbox and games"" as the make up crap and it infuriates me just the same. Breaking another adults things is not okay. "

But if they sign an antinuptial agreement (or post in this case), they would only lose what's his and in his name, so he could say put the house and cars in her name and those items would be protected should his business fail. When I got married our lawyer stronger advised us to go for this option has my husband wanted to start working as a contractor. We didn't, but if there is this much money involved, I don't see it has a bad thing? Obviously there could still also be way more to the story like everyone is suggesting."
"Yeah, i mean I've read some pretty grimey shit on Reddit where people get divorced and the wife ends up getting a large portion, gets the house, keeps the kids, etc, etc. I have my SO and i'd want to cover all my bases. Not because I don't trust her but because life can take a huge shit on you unexpectedly, and you'd rather be safe than sorry. "
"&gt;Husband did not stick up for me.

Unforgivable. 

Offer him the choice: couples counselling or divorce. But bluntly he needs to reduce contact with her, a lot."
"No, two wrongs definitely don't make a right...however, I'm sorry to say that your 'wrong' has gotten onto a high horse, and I'm struggling to see true regret for what you've done. It feels like blame-shifting here, from you to her. Emotional affairs are (imo, just my definition) just as bad as physical, but holy shit, OP. You're not the victim here."
"You worded this so much better than I ever could. OP, there is 100% chance your friend heard ""I only listened to you because I wanted to bang you"". This is why she doesn't want to be your friend anymore - because you destroyed any image she had of a friendship with you. I had one of my friends try to date me shortly after I went through a similarly tough experience, and it basically just solidified what my girlfriends had been telling me: he had only been my shoulder to cry on through that time to get in my pants. It was devastating. You should leave her alone "
"A symbolic payment goes a long way. He maintains the habit of paying rent, learn to show his dad some respect  but can  still afford to save some  money. "
"I have to disagree. Cocaine is EXTREMELY prevalent on college campuses.pretty much Every single party you go to, there is either someone there who has Cocaine, or someone there is on cocaine.

Now I'm not saying it's a good thing to go out and do. But coke in college is a lot more common that many would like to think. So, yes, it is quite a ""normal"" thing. (I mean normal as common). Colleges are literalmoney bags for drug dealers."
What worries me as well was that it was in front of several of his family members - makes me worry about how he would have reacted if alone or in the future if something happens again and no one else is around. Idk. 
"I don't mean to be rude, but doesn't it concern you that your wife is an idiot?"
"It's perfectly okay to be offended by hurtful comments from her, but it's not okay to be offensive in return. I understand you might not see it, but some of the language in your post is fairly divisive and disparaging of ""people like her."" Don't let this couple's behavior make you prejudiced. "
"Exactly! And why isn't he making sure that the kids make little gifts for her? Seriously. If they're old enough to talk, they're old enough to do arts and crafts. 

Personally, I think he enjoys his life separate from OP--he goes to work, he has friends, he socializes, all the while OP is hidden at home with no friends and no love. His mother is well off and gifts him money consistently, yet he can't get anything to put under the tree? Plus, how he reacted to her expressing hurt clearly indicates he is checked out of the marriage. I wouldn't be surprised if some of his fun gifts have come from a specific coworker that is ""just a friend.""

Seriously OP, just because you're a SAHM doesn't mean you're not a person. You deserve happiness. Can you get back to work anytime soon? Perhaps schooling when the youngest goes to kinder? Developing an identity outside of SAHM and chef/maid is super important. That will be your ticket out. And as this sounds like just the tip of the iceberg with your awful husband, when you leave him you should leave nothing behind beyond soda and ice cream. What a jerk. "
"I'm not sure I would recommend my favourites murder (don't hate me reddit!!). So much is mindless conjecture. Half the time they barely seem like they've read the wiki on the crime. It doesn't feel like the presenters are taking the gravity of murder seriously either - it's very jokey back and forth. Not to mention on occasion they get some of their facts wrong.



Buuuuuuut..... Casefiles is a REALLY REALLY GOOD podcast. It's an Australian one, and it's done very well. They do a shit ton of research, on occasion will have snippets of interviews and recordings (but not overdone). The presenter is incredibly respectful to the victims and doesn't over indulge in the brutality in their assaults. 
But my favourite part, they'll follow the crime, the investigation, the court cases and will even have a bit of a follow up of the criminal in jail since.



Like most podcasts his earlier ones are less produced, but later in the series they're extremely polished! They're also not just on Aussie murders - although they do make up a large portion. Which as an Aussie is wonderfully terrifying because I'm very familiar with the locations of a lot of the murders.


I recommend listening to:



The moors murders 



Anita Coby




Daniel Morecomb




Katherine Knight






Happy listening!"
"LOL. Just because someone hasn't Googled the intricacies of taking Plan B and when the absolute most 100% effective time is to take a pregnancy test, doesn't mean she can't tell when HER OWN PERIOD is off. Shut the fuck up and get some help w your anxiety."
"Also, it's illegal in Australia (assuming you're in Aus). Where are you even getting it from?

I'm not surprised kids are looking down on you for smoking pot in year 9. You're still a kid.

Having cars at your age in Australia is also a bit unusual...

You might be coming across as trying a bit hard to be 'unique' if you know what I mean. 

If you want to leave at the end of next year, I'd just try keeping a slightly lower profile, and keep your eyes on your end goal. 

If I it gets too bad, I'd change schools."
"&gt;And he forces kids to sleep in a basement full of dead animals.

&gt;Come on. It’s a little creepy.

Okay, okay. The dead animal thing is creepy. I'll give you that."
"That's absolutely disgusting of him, and you are completely valid in feeling disrespected by it. 

Also, you said you've been dating for over a year, does that mean you started your relationship when you were 17 and he was 23?"
"Be careful though, vengeance can sometimes blow up in your face.  Plus, it may be emotionally devastating to have to talk and deal with them at all."
"Why the fuck did you marry him? Can you get Karl to write the letter instead? Living separately - I mean, really, you're barely married and he clearly gives absolutely no fucks about you. You have to get out of this situation."
"Why should you die alone because OP made terrible choices? He built a crappy marriage and raised a rotten kid and he still can't take the simplest steps to make improvements. 

This is the perfect example of lazy parenting. If you want to enjoy your kids set firm boundaries and make yourself a priority. Then your kids grow up to see you as important. People who make their kids the most important things end up with children who don't respect them "
"If anyone dared try to throw *childhood trauma* in my partners face I would absolutely go no contact. Anything less is you basically saying she can get away with that kind of thing.


She also sounds like a crappy familial figure to have around your kid. Considering your sisters parenting sounds horrible, her cousins will probably only get worse with age as well and possibly be terrible influences on her.

"
The advice stands. You have to know what you're dealing with and what would be required to work around it. Go get your diagnosis before you say anything. Right now you're just wildly speculating and self-diagnosing which helps nobody. It's just spinning anxiety and worry instead of anything real.
Awwwwww you're so cute! 
"Why? So you can be even more hurt and pissed off? He is going to lie to your face, and it will just hurt you and make it even harder. You have a situation that you can control and get some satisfaction out of if you play it right. If you confront him in person, that control and satisfaction will all go away. "
"DO NOT sign anything and consult a lawyer asap. 

Do not leave your job. "
"What you listed above is exactly what I’m afraid of. My husband and I have been together for long enough where I’m not exactly new and exciting to him.

 His business partner had a long term girlfriend who he dumped last year and he’s now dating legit 10/10 beauties and that’s not me 😔

I don’t know but I really really feel like he’s gonna leave me. "
DH needs to shine up that spine...
"Write another message, “? No seriously, I don’t understand. Is this a racist thing?”  Call your parents and say “how dare you sit and watch while your son makes racist comments about my husband. I am disgusted with all of you.” 

This is your freaking husband you are sticking up for. Don’t you dare sit back and let your family think this is tolerable. It isn’t."
"Ugh I'm sorry that's brutal. What you were saying was ""I don't want that couch but I don't want to control you."" What he heard was something totally different. 

So you need to make it clear to him that his misunderstanding of what you meant is regrettable, but not your fault. And now he can either choose to understand what you meant or choose to deliberately ignore the truth in order to browbeat and guilt trip you. 

Stand up for yourself. Don't let him convince you you did something wrong over a miscommunication. This could be a red flag that every time you don't go along with his plan he thinks you're not committed to the relationship. That's toxic shit right there. "
"He's a jerk because partners should help each other. If I had a lot of money and my partner had a little, looks like he and I have a medium amount of money "
"yeah, but you also *know* they make bank. it's not like this one factor exists in isolation, it's just one fairly significant one of many. i have a rough idea of how much my colleagues are struggling/comfortable just by interacting with them at work. OP's bf would have to be mentally challenged to not realize that her non lucrative job + tuition + expensive area means she's unable to get on easily, unless she was making mammoth efforts to hide it, which it doesn't sound like she is. "
"Coming from a non-religious perspective, I can understand having moral objections to porn, but masturbation is seen by psychologists as healthy and normal. It's something that around 95% of men (and 80% of women) do, and it doesn't harm anyone so it's hard for me to wrap my head around the objection. I'm sorry your religion disagrees, it must be a struggle. 

If your wife can never accept you masturbating even without porn, honestly, I'd advise you to masturbate stealthily in the shower. It's better than remaining sexually frustrated for months, or begging her to give you handjobs when she's not in the mood. 

Glad you're seeing a therapist soon - I hope that helps."
What is your boyfriend gonna do. Just sit and open a pile of presents while you and baby watch???? Seriously...your boyfriend should be handling this. 
This is a RAPIST!! dtmfa.
"You're not a brat because $300 earrings make your stomach turn. That's a normal human reaction to receiving something you neither need nor can afford.

A year ago, my dad bought me a ""fashionable"" single earring for $500. At the time my rent was only $400 and I was quietly struggling to remain independent of my parents. I was unemployed and living in a ghetto. I had no use for ONE earring. I was able to sell it on eBay but made less than half of the original price. Even with a better paying job today, I still feel sick and spoiled even thinking about it. That was a gift for him, not me, and it gave me grief more than it made me feel love."
"You're not overreacting at all - anyone with an ounce of social intelligence would have found a way to communicate something like ""hey, sorry, can't talk much because I'm busy"" without sounding half as cruel as your boyfriend did. What the actual fuck, there was no reason for him to be as mean as he was.

Don't talk to him today. And honestly (this is me being petty), I wouldn't even text him the next day. I'd personally be interested in seeing how he goes about contacting you, if at all. "
I think I’d want To alienate my sister if she was trying to have sex with me
"My first thought is she's looking to rob you. She can probably sense that you're lonely and vulnerable. 

EDIT: Also, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is."
Makes me wonder if OP was just the 1st or 2nd relationship of the guy. There is a reason why the first few relationships don't work out well for most. 
"It’s super tone deaf and awkward to break up with someone and then jump straight into dating their sibling. 

The brother also sounds kinda shady. It’s good he showed you evidence of your boyfriend cheating but it’s super weird that he did that and then quickly asked you out. It almost seems like he showed that evidence so he could set you up to ask out. "
"Welp I personally wouldn't be interested in fixing something that I consider to be a basic character flaw (possessiveness). OP can have at it if she'd like, but it seems like she's got a lifetime of ""I was feeling insecure so I acted badly and took it out on you,"" to look forward to. Not my thing."
Right?? I thought that part was pretty messed up and hypocritical. I get that he's going through a rough time but it's completely inexcusable if he's projecting his issues onto others and causing damage to your relationship. If he's accusing you of cheating you could always turn it on him and tell him that not everyone's a self centered cheating d-bag like he is.
"You're right that we don't know for sure, but considering the fact that she's 20, she's got no experience, according to OP she's got very little work ethic, and she's now got no one to mentor her or show her the ropes.....my money is still going to be placed firmly on her bungling it up.  "
"That's not demeaning her, that's pointing out the damn truth. People who are chemically out of their fucking gourd still have the empathy to not leave an animal to freeze to death in the snow. 

OP you can't stay with her. She's evil."
"Your dad is abusing your daughter, he's re-tramatizing her.  You need to stop forcing her to be around them, and if it means cutting ties, do it.

Who's more important, your NDad or your traumatized daughter?"
You now have an ex-boyfriend and an ex-best friend. You get to start 2018 with a clean slate! Painful but it’s always good to get snakes out of your life.
"Escalating with my brother doesn’t accomplish anything. He’ll shut down, or try to match my tone or aggression. Either way, nobody wins and the situation can get rockier. It doesn’t become violent but he starts to hurt himself- pulls his hair, scratches at his skin, etc.- and will start screeching. All I could do was remove my son from the situation, and try to get him to a more reasonable mindset later. Adam is very difficult to argue with."
"There's a difference between being *in* a war (zone) and *at* war. He could still be in an active war zone, even if the US isn't *at* war with anyone."
"Heck, I wouldn't have wanted him to drive my car, end of story. If anything I'd be even less inclined to ride with him than I'd be to let him use my car. Rather the car gets ruined than riding with him when it happens, tbh. 

That said ""no, you can't drive my car"" all the way. No ifs and buts, just a plain ol' ""nope"". "
"I tend to agree with your girlfriend. You’ve done nothing to reign in your dad’s ridiculous/disrespectful behavior. And you made Christmas plans that exclude your girlfriend. You could’ve told your parents to plan for Christmas dinner on the 26th but instead, you asked her to “hang out” while a meal is being prepared that she doesn’t even get to eat. You seem a little lost as to why she feels like you don’t care, but...does it seem to you like you really care about her feelings?

The answer is simple buddy: reign in your dad and plan something nice for her for Christmas."
So what exactly makes them think they know more than you when it comes to finances? 
Every reply has been an ocean of excuses. OP won’t listen to logic or reason at all. Just wants a pity party thread. 
"Wow way to make everything about yourself, OP.

Don't take the kid if you don't want it, IF anything even happens to them (by the time the kid is 18 one mom will only be in her mid 60s).

Let those grown ass women do what they want."
"How far along are you? I don't mean to scare you, but miscarriage isn't uncommon during the first trimester and many people choose not to announce pregnancy until after the first trimester for this reason. So, yes, this actually is sensitive information and no one should spill the baby beans but you at the time and in the way of your choosing.

I am awaiting the birth of my first grandchild in the late spring. My daughter told me before she told anyone else. I was super excited, it was hard to hold it in, but I kept my mouth shut until my daughter announced to family, then I told...well...everyone else on the planet that would listen. :)

Congratulations!"
"I still hate porn because I see what it does to people. It not only completely changes the way that they see sex and expect pleasure (for example I get really quiet when I'm enjoying myself and getting close). It also really ups the necessary stimulation level required mentally. Like guys that would come to see me originally and just watch me do a ""vanilla"" show would want more and more intense things until we were doing hardcore dominatrix shows where I would be making fun of their dicks and telling them how to masturbate. It's like after seeing something for a while they have to up the ante in order to get the same level of enjoyment from it. It becomes impossible to get the same level of fulfillment from clips - let alone from real life.

and absolutely to:

&gt;I'd find his jizz tissues all over the house, and it was just a shitty reminder that I wasn't getting any that night, again.

amen. I was really hoping to have sex on my birthday, but after we had dinner that night and went back to his apartment he confessed that he had watched a video of me to be romantic (lmfuckingao) and we wouldn't. That was just the last straw for me. Like you can't abstain on the ONE DAY that it actually means something to me? And you're watching a video OF ME anyway? Why not just wait to get to fuck me??

--

whatever. So beyond men like that at this point. Glad that we have both not only moved onwards but upwards. Everyone deserves better. "
"Even if he didn't physically cheat, the lying is more than enough to leave someone for. "
"I've never excused myself from an activity I was engaged in to go jack off. That's the part that's actually weird to me - not the jacking off, not that it's in someone else's house, but that he felt the need to stop what he was doing to go take care of it."
"To be honest, I would be pretty unnerved by finding out my SO was into that stuff as well. I think if people are unfamiliar with the genre they might want to check it out just to have some context before they comment. Having said that, in his shoes yes, I would have wanted to know earlier on in the relationship and his sense of betrayal is probably real. I think ""I don't know what you are capable of"" is going a bit far, but I understand his wondering how your character would allow you find that stuff entertaining. The best I can suggest is that you explain yourself as well as possible, and let him know that drawing pictures of torture and gore is as far as it will ever go. Then let him decide if he can live with that. "
"&gt;Guests are like fish, they usually start being unappealing after 3 days.

Off-topic, but I found this in a book about idioms from all over the world, and learned that a version of this idiom (usually involving guests and fish as the comparison but timeframe varying from 3-7 days) exists in all kinds of (sometimes wholly unrelated and unconnected) languages and cultures. "
The problem with always assuming the worst is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  You keep accusing him of cheating and he may cheat just because it seems you expect him to.  Or he is just going to leave because of the lack of trust.
I think he’s been reading too much tumblr 🙄
"I'm so happy for you! That is the cutest thing I've read in a while. I remember responding to your thread. Remember, take it slow and be sure, take it fast and it won't last. I wish you guys the best. "
"Literally unreal. As in, I believe this post is as fictional as Santa himself. "
"lol yeah I also don't want to clean up my messes. Or pay my bills. Or exercise... he lives with someone else. Yeah, most people understand in a shared living situation you clean up after yourself. Even a ROOMMATE would have the right to demand he clean up four cans off a desk in a shared space even if it was HIS desk. And she didn't demand, she asked, if you cause this much tension over a 10 second request then I think you're the issue not your partner who just wants you to clean up after yourself. "
"Do you think that when you are making as much or more than him, he will contribute 50% or more to household chores?"
"As you probably suspect, this won't be the last time she brings drama into your life.  Go ahead with your plans without her, enjoy your Christmas with people who can behave reasonably.  If she wanted firm plans she should have picked up the phone and talk to you, in advance.  In the grand scheme of things, it might not be a bad thing for her to know, you won't knuckle down to her tantrums.  Your husband needs to sort this out with her after the holidays.  "
"&gt; And that night, after I got back from my run, he was in his computer room jerking off to some porn star. I tried to join him and he pushed me away, saying it was like drinking generic soda after years of Coca Cola.

Whhhaaaat the fuck. Whhaaat the fuck. Whhyyyy are you with this guy. Whhhaaaat the fuck."
"Dude, Upvote. That's an incredibly sincere way to approach dating and I can't imagine many people would approach potential partners with that level of honesty. "
Its  a holiday! What is wrong with everyone in this sub? Babies have different schedules and young parents have more unconventional sleep schedules hence not as strict with their babies schedules.
"Do NOT cover for him, it will only make you feel worse. Don't downplay ""oh no, it's ok, he just moved, he's been busy."" No. Let HIM feel uncomfortable."
"Break up with this woman. She is clearly willing to ruin your life without any second thought. She's dangerous and you should get as far away from her as possible. If you can, I would get evidence of her threatening to accuse you before the break up just so you can use that against her if you need to."
"Your sympathy that you are displaying here for OP is misplaced. The problem is not only that she hit her boyfriend in a fit of drunken rage, but also that she refuses to take full responsibility for it; as you see in the comments, she is still shifting blame to her boyfriend (""we are both responsible for the events that lead up to it""). Nobody here is saying that she will never be able to change, but the first step is for her to take an honest look at herself and the consequences of her actions, which also means that she needs to stop blaming other people."
"&gt; Is that normal? 

Hell no! He is a disgusting creep!

&gt; How do I get rid of him?
Break up with him, go no contact, don’t look back. I don’t know you but I *promise* that you can do so much better! "
"For those of you not knowing what OP is talking about, imagine a cute little innocent critter.  Then you cut off it's genitals with a pair of scissors.  Then break all it's legs.  Then make it watch while it's children are crushed with a hammer.  Then light it on fire to put it out of it's misery.  That is the typical sort of content in fluffy comics.  It's absolutely the kind of shit that if a child drew it, you would get them into therapy ASAP.  Enjoyment of that sort of art really does strongly suggest there is some dark shit going on in that person's head."
"&gt; I can't imagine a life without my boyfriend because aside from this everything is perfect but I can't imagine dealing with his toxic family for the rest of my life.

You should try visualizing things a bit harder as it is very easy to imagine both scenarios. There are plenty of men who will stand up to their families for you, or who dont have toxic families to begin with. I can also easiky imagine these people making your life a misery. I would be rethinking my future with this guy."
"It is the height of irresponsibility for someone to not seriously consider all the risks of causing a whole being to exist, and what they would do if faced with those issues, before making such a life changing decision."
"It's not like she was supportive of yours though.  As you said she contributed nothing but showing up and essentially stealing the day while you were hooked up to life support. Even if theydon't realize it, your mother is still competing the 2 of you."
"Or she'd be around him to avoid hurting OP. I'm not saying that that's wanting to be around him, but OP needs to be aware that her daughter may try to put everyone else ahead of herself."
"Catfishing isn't always about getting monetary value out of the other person. Sometimes people catfish because they want affection and a relationship, but feel that they aren't good-looking enough to get that without lying or pretending to be someone different. "
"There is no hierarchy to abuse. Your sisters sexual abuse does not negate or lessen the abuse you have suffered at your fathers hands. You have to separate your experiences; they are not mutually exclusive. 

You have every right to not want to be around your abuser, just as your sister has every right to forgive him immediately. You are on different journeys. Explain that whilst you love your mother and sister, you can’t be around your father. You don’t have to justify the reasons why as it’s actually not any of their business.

Make it clear that you don’t want to discuss your father. You don’t want to talk about him, you don’t want to know about his progress- he has nothing to do with your relationship with your mother and sister. The fact you haven’t visited them much is neither here nor there- your sister is using it as an excuse to stampede through your boundaries regarding your father, to guilt you into seeing him and keep the peace. Don’t cave in to this manipulation. 

You need to call CPS or whatever authority is in your country. Your niblings are the product of semi-incestuous abuse (I say semi-incestuous as they’re not blood relations, but it’s still sexual abuse within a family dynamic.) They need to be assessed and your sister needs to be assessed as she doesn’t appear to be making safe decisions on their behalf. 

Most of all, please remember that your abuse was real and it is valid. Just because your sister was subjected to a different kind of abuse, that doesn’t make your abuse any less. You have exactly the same right to walk away as she does. Process your abuse. Don’t down play it because you feel like yours is somehow invalid in light of these developments. 

Take care OP. "
"This is this sub. Big age gaps are always relevant. In this case particular they are relevant because older men who date younger women are often controlling and/or unwilling to compromise about doing things the way they want to do them. 

In this case it sounds like this women wants to fuck OP’s husband and he probably knows it. But he is makinG OP out to be a bad guy for having a problem with it. "
I have Borderline Personality Disorder and the thing about PDs is that people need to be willing to change before they get help. I went from externalizing my behaviors to internalizing them and had come to terms with some very uncomfortable truths. OP's brother just seems to be doubling down on his behavior so I wouldn't place my money on him getting help in this decade.
"Haha, thank you. That actually makes a lot of sense. I think my problem is that I stick around to “make it work” because I’ve been fed romcoms my whole life?

This has been a good lesson. I need to start listening to the little voice inside my head and walking out as soon as the situation starts feeling wrong for me."
"Apologies in advance because perhaps my inclinations are a lot more aggressive than yours, but I'd start with something you said, ""My parents haven’t financially supported me since I was 18. They would like to but aren’t able to.""

What this tells me is that they are not financial successes in their own terms.  I would turn around the conversation and start asking them about their experiences, where they think they went right or wrong.  Ask specifically about regrets, or lost opportunities, or opportunities they wish they had which would have made the difference.  Sons and daughters don't usually know this level of detail about their parents' lives and thoughts about themselves.

Eventually you may be able to argue that your current path reflects some of the lessons they've learned; if there are things you'd be willing to do differently (not leave your current path), you can give their lessons credit for that, but in any case having a conversation like this puts you more in charge; moves them away from generally feelings and to actual things that have happened; their own stories may remind them that they may have made their own mistakes - it's the beginning of talking to your parents as equals, which is something that adult children should eventually achieve, while giving them full credit for their years of experience.  Once you've opened this discussion you can always guide the nagging back in this direction.

And of course you should also be fully armed with compensation data from your chosen field - those levels above the entry level which you will achieve in time.  Giving them a timeline is inadvisable, because they will double down if things don't happen on schedule, but your financial career goal is probably a happy number, given to them as a number.

Good luck!"
"Why? Your pseudo-friend is blatantly hoping for your relationship to blow up, and the flowers/gift sound like deliberate provocation to that end. Your boyfriend has been very clear about his history with infidelity, his views on it, and has taken a reasonable stand about what's been going on. Why would you put a long term, apparently happy relationship at risk for someone who would be so disrespectful of you and your boyfriend? If I were your SO, I would feel incredibly upset about your attitude and actions."
"&gt; My niece went around the table screaming at Thanksgiving, and nobody bat an eyelash. Aside from my sister, nobody showed any visible discomfort until after the fact

Just a question, whose house was that at? Because if Brother A's kid is walking around screaming at Brother A's house, no one is really going to feel as comfortable telling him to control his children. "
"Maybe you need to gird-your loins for some criticism and just ask your best-friend when you get the chance. I mean we can't tell you whether you are being weird/awkward or your friends are being jerks.

Although are you very socially anxious? I'm picking up a vibe that when everyone hangs out you might be sitting on the edge of your seat staring at everyone analyzing their reactions when this happens sometimes its not anything in particular that gets said its just that your body language and manner might be uncomfortable.    "
"To be fair it's not that easy. I'm in a similar situation.

McDonalds doesn't want someone with a BS in Biology and who managed a medical clinic for a ""starter"" job. They know it's not at all what you want and you won't stay."
"OP, this is despicable behavior. I know you didn't set out to hurt this woman and, in fact, I can tell you genuinely care about her. That's why it's all the worse that you continued the relationship knowing you weren't attracted to her, knowing that you were only with her because you couldn't find anyone else at the time.

You said you miss a fulfilling sex life with a woman you are attracted to. I'm sure she would also like a fulfilling sex life with a man who feels that attraction for her. 

You're only thinking of yourself - your desperation, your defeatist attitude about your prospects, your needs, what *you* wish you had. You're perpetrating a deception against this woman you think is wonderful and, for what? You're not happy. Her happiness is built on a lie. Break up with her!

"People get obsessed with podcasts. I'm Deaf, and do you think that stops anyone from recommending them? And when I'm like, do you have a transcript? They're just like, ""uhhhh.."" Of course they don't. Hearing and listening are highly overrated, and are not the best and only ways to absorb information, but hearing people sure think this is the case. I am an educated person with a higher degree, and I use sign language and read to absorb information. I would consider myself someone who enjoys intellectual persuits. Did I get this far in life listening to people yammer on about stuff on a podcast? No. Everyone learns differently. Your husband needs to realize this. I feel your pain. Podcasts can eff off. I'm very direct so I'd be like, shove the podcast up your arse. Not everyone takes that approach, though. It also sounds like he thinks you aren't intellectual enough, and he sounds condescending, which is another issue. "
"&gt; Has she gone to the doctor at all about the pain from sex? Would she be willing to try any sexual therapy? 

Agreed.  There's a variety of physical and mental things that can cause her to keep having pain with sex and they can be corrected/worked through."
"It hasn't gotten to the betrayal stage yet, but I am trying to navigate this as carefully as possible. We definitely need to talk again. I am going to discuss three things:

1. Ask him if he is afraid of being alone.
2. Tell him the difference between loving someone and being excited that they accept you.
3. Give him a requirement of 2 years before taking any major steps: moving in, marriage, etc.
4. If we do get married after those 2 years, I want a new ring and to plan an actual wedding rather than have a courthouse wedding."
"Meh, people masturbate. It was an unfortunate situation with the porn (and hilarious) but it's not creepy or anything. He had gone a dew days without sex. I was slightly (ever so slightly) weirded out thinking he went in the middle of a game during the day to do it, but it was bedtime and probably the only dew minutes he could get alone to relieve himself. "
Human trafficking for ISIS is a very real possibility here. I feel you are naive to not see that. 
"You’re not the one damaging family relations, HE is the one damaging it by being a horrible house guest. Your mom should sit him down and reiterate the house rules - for example no smoking inside, no cooking and loud noises past 10pm on weekdays. If he continues to break them, then she’ll need to threaten to kick him out. Should also preemptively talk to his parents and let them know their son’s behavior is unacceptable. At the end of the day, he’s an adult and should be more than capable of finding his own housing. "
"&gt; It also explains the code names.

Still stupid AF though to use ""Mom"" as a code name instead of something like James or Mike. If OP sees a text thread from Mom, she's definitely going to open it because WTF. Whereas if she sees a text from some dude's name about orange juice, she's probably just going to shrug it off. "

Schizophrenia can also run in families. Its possible that her future in laws would be incredibly toxic to her future children because they *might* also be schizophrenic. 
"Agreed.

Especially as it is sounding like he was a lot more drunk then he is letting on.

Calling your wife a mean bitch? Then deciding it was a great idea to pull the moves on her when you knew she was upset.

This is not a sign of someone tipsy or had a 'little' to drink. This is a sign that he was probably pretty damn drunk.

This makes me assume he is under playing everything and she probably asked him to stop it and he kept trying to 'get her in the mood' and she got fed up/scared and pushed him. "
"No, but it's asking people like her for their advice though... so what's your point?"

"Play with it.  The cat also has a need to let out its energy, so use a stick-and-feather type of toy that it has to chase and jump for to get it really tired out before it gets dinner.  Do the same thing in the morning, i.e. wear the cat out before it gets fed.  This should help kitty regulate its activity cycle and sleep/relax at night.

The other thing is IGNORE THE CAT.  When you're sleeping, cat gets no attention either positive or negative.  That will be incredibly hard but it should learn that it won't get attention by crying before too long.  Your GF will have to go along with this as well."
"Its a survey with a sample size of two people running on youth and anecdotes.  Its basically the worst possible base to build a judgement from.

Yes it is perfectly normal.  Almost common, sadly.  More prevalent back in days gone by due to a general lack of informed sexual wellness knowledge, but still in no way a defect in your person, your sexuality or your future as a fulfilled sexual individual."
It's not a good idea to antagonize a very real threat. 
"Maybe instead of outright rejecting it, tell her thank you, that the trip won't work this year, (as you need your vacation days to get things done and that will actually help reduce your stress) but work on planning a different vacation with your mom for next year. Maybe one with both a beach and activities for your wife and kids nearby, that everyone can enjoy. "
"How I read your post in a nutshell: ""He wants a wedding. I don't see any reason to have a wedding, it won't make me happy."" It seems like the reason to have a wedding would be that your fiancé wants it and it'll make him happy and you don't care either way.

If your resistance is purely financial, then that's something to talk about more specifically, what kind of financial outlay he imagines and where he might be willing to compromise and if you're generally on the same page in terms of financial attitudes. If your resistance is the work that goes into it, you can talk about your conditions for that; maybe you'd want him to do the vast majority of the work in planning it. This kind of discussion can be helpful for your future life together.

But based on your post it doesn't sound like you have much reason to oppose the idea of a wedding in itself, so I wouldn't start from there. I would look at your specific objections and how you can both be happy.

It probably is his baby. There is no other reason he should be giving her money on the regular.

No, absolutely not.  Not her child, not her business.  If her brother comes to her asking what she would do, then she can give her honest opinion.  However, she has to still realize that this is their decision to make, and it's really not worth fucking up a relationship to ""plead her case""."
"&gt; I know her family needs me and she needs me, and i can’t abandon my best friend.

Her family does not need you. Her family needs the doctors and professionals around them that is helping them through this. She no longer needs you either; as you said, she is no longer who she used to be. To be frank, she likely doesnt have any idea who you are any more. 

Like her family has professionals helping them out, you need a professional as well. You need to be seeing a therapist regularly who specializes in grief. "

"Is it possible you are asexual? My recent ex was asexual and the way he felt towards sex mirrors your feelings, particularly the ""nothingness"" aspect.


Asexuals can still have sexual relationships, as we did, but it takes a lot of work and communication with the sexual partner. It's likely he is picking up on your lack of desire/interest in sex and seeing it as repression when it could just be your (lack of) sexuality. The two of you may be sexually incompatible."
"Truth is, you've probably already lost your bestfriend, you're no longer just a friend to him, you're an option for sex now. This is just my opinion, but it seems like once he knew you liked him it made it easier for him to see if you'd be interested in exploring your sexuality with him. As your friend, he should have respected you enough to stop when you first turned him down. "
"Haha I’m glad you could relate. I honestly don’t think it’s anything I’m doing. I’m not timid or shy, and rarely ever have the problem of holding conversations and consider myself an interesting story teller. They made eye contact with me and there was no one else talking and they just moved along like I hadn’t said anything. The 2 examples are 2 of many from the week. And at this point, I’m just sitting alone in the room because I don’t know what else to do. 

His dad made that comment and then hasn’t tried to get to know me at all. I asked him dozens of questions about his life and maybe got 1 in return. Idk I’m sorry if this comes off rude, I’m just venting. Thanks for your insight. "
"My ex did almost the same thing to me. Doggy style, started playing around with his finger, I *clearly* said no and he slipped it in anyway. No lube, never played around back there at all. It was the beginning of the end for us. I never trusted him again and refused to let him on top the few times we had sex afterwards.

It doesn't matter what her intentions are. Your friend is making your girlfriend uncomfortable *and so are you.* No wonder she feels like Janelle is your first choice; for years, you've been putting her (and your) comfort above Sally's. Set a better boundary, dude. "

"I just went through something similar with my brother. I traveled to a remote town to visit another family member.

Calmly without defending or explaining anything beyond I refuse due to his abuse. I simply saw who I wanted and left town. 

I share this because sometimes I just need to be told that me say “no thank you” is okay. 100% OKAY. If that is what you choose. 

Bonus: the family member I visited was ready to support my brother’s wife in her bid to escape him a week before my visit.

"I enjoy podcasts, and I've suggested a couple to my SO, but I think your husband is acting in a very childish manner. Just tell him you aren't interested in podcasts, you're not going to be, but you're willing to compromise and listen to them with him occasionally if he just lets it go and stops pestering you. Then, on the roadtrip, you can compromise and each get to listen to a bit of what you want, if you can't find something you both enjoy.

Try it you like it is fine once or twice, but if you say no beyond that he needs to learn to let it go. It's not a dealbreaker, but it's annoying, so *every* time he does that just get firm with him and say no. Don't entertain it, debate it, discuss, don't say anything but no, over and over every time he asks.

The other issue that seems to be bubbling here is that he maybe sees himself as more intellectual as you are? That's not great for a relationship, and something you should address if you agree it is happening."

"Completely agree!  I think Rachel's discomfort is an undervalued aspect of this post - Rachel pretty clearly doesn't want to get closer to OP, so keeping things at a professional level is being respectful of Rachel's boundaries as well as Chelsea's."

The part where the OP studied to be able to manage the business.

"Maybe if he didn't make sure in the past to intentionally make her do his dishes, that would be a possibility."
"I don’t think he’s wrong for not being ready to continue the relationship right now. Even if her trip had a good reason (and it’s great it went so well she went from severe PPD to fully functional in just over a month), from his perspective it was five weeks of hell. He had enough time to go through the stages of grief, and probably spent many nights pondering why he’d do if she was dead, or what he’d do if she came back. He’s already in an emotionally progressed place about it compared to her, but it’s a place without her in it. She didn’t give him the chance to emotionally include her, because she didn’t tell him anything about why or where she left. As far as he knew she actually had jumped off a cliff. Presumably he still has a job, and he had to juggle that with a newborn for over a month. It takes 21 days to establish a habit. 5 weeks is therefore plenty of time to have established a new routine without her. If she wants to try the relationship again, she needs to give him time and space to remember why he fell in love with her in the first place, not rubbing in how she wants him to forget his misery so she can pretend her problems never existed.

Tell them it isn't your fault she's a poor fit for the company / position in pretty much every way, and that what you hear is that she lacked professionalism which reflects poorly _on you_.

"Yes, your actions are normal and both of you will have lapses of attention of more consequence than a forgotten backpack as you raise your son.

I did want to point one thing out:  your small offhand reference to your son's mother's preferences on bedtime/TV made enough of an impression on your son that he repeated it to her the next day.  It wasn't even close to a psychopathic remark, but there it indicated enough distance between your approaches (nice dad/strict mom) that it either made an impression or he wanted to whack his mother with it.  Although his mother is way over-reacting, your attention shouldn't waiver from how your son took the remark - as a learning moment for you, not something to beat yourself up over (or be beaten up for...)

I adore babies and children, I've been a long term nanny and babysat kids of all ages. I love kids and want them. But what if I don't find a partner? What if it doesn't happen the natural way? Biological clocks are a real thing, and once you hit 30 it's harder and harder every year. Plus the stigma of being an older parent is real. So why can't she have a baby? This baby is very much planned and wanted and loved, which is more than you can say for a large percentage of births. Maybe everyone should just lay off OP's decision to have a baby and try and help her with the problem she's come here to talk about. 

Also, fuck this whole mental health discrimination bullshit. She's in therapy, she's working on it, she's doing the best she can. Stop tearing her down. "
You said in another comment that you think he is more intelligent than you. Maybe he puts you down more than you think.
I don't think your wife is out of line here although she should probably keep that to herself. You can't expect her to be the mom for your biological kids you wanted your ex to be - that's not a fair position to put her in. But it sounds like she's there for your kids and treats them well. 
"This exact thing happened to me except on a college level. It's even worse given that you are a minor in high school. I wish someone told me how inappropriate the situation was before I let it get out of hand.

What I can tell you is he is not your friend; the power imbalance of the situation means you cannot have a healthy friendship. He is emotionally manipulative and EXPLOITING YOU AND THE SITUATION. Please, no matter how good of a guy you think he is, he is a 36 year old man taking advantage of a 17 year old student. 

It's been a year since my situation, and I'm still unpacking some of the shit that went down. I feel dirty and stupid in hindsight, but I'm trying to keep in mind that it isn't my fault. If you want to talk about it privately, PM me. Our situations are extremely similar."
"Please get everything on paper-like birth certificate /think about child support in the future, this man has no bills and lives with his parents, you will be stuck with all expenses/all bills for a child/and bills on the emotional side as well. Think about child support, making him pay for the future. The fact that he wanted to make you live in a fake addition that wasn't built on his parents home-not even a home of your own for 2 thirty yrs olds/says to me he's well tied to his parents. This is going to be very hard. Do you have good family support?"
"&gt;not completely nonexistent, but rare enough to where it's not my biggest concern

How nice that his infidelities are rare. You either have incredibly low expectations or your normal meter is smashed to smithereens. Don't you think your kids at least deserve better?"
"So she's supposed to be fine that her husband cheated on her when they were engaged, lied to her for over a year, invited his side piece to their wedding and was giving his baby mama money without saying much. I don't think OP would have ever known about this unless she found out, her husband seemed pretty content on being sneaky and lying to her forever. I couldn't forgive that. "
"Okay that's a good point and a good example. I think I was over thinking this

Edit: Thank you!
"
"I think we're using the wrong sport analogy. Checkered flag means she won. A detour still takes you to the same destination.

He should give her the red card.

"
"Honestly, I'd stay out of it.  "
"Yeah, definitely check out /r/justnomil OP. Seeing other stories will help you realize how they’re treating you as “not family” and it’ll give you advice on how to move forward in the situation.  "
Right?? I shivered reading that it was so creepy and entitled. 
"lol.

Her parents bought her a vacation to go to Florida so she could help someone move. Oooookay. 

I know its Christmas day but there's a perfect way to make your Christmas awesome. Send her a message dumping her (you've been paying for her entire life, bills and all, and she has this shady relationship with some other guy? SEE YA) go enjoy your Christmas with your family. Then go on a rip roaring boys night if you've got any time off the next few days. Do it up HUGE for NYE."
"I hadnt even thought of that. He may have brought over the ""santa"" presents and stayed to help his goddaughter open the christmas presents. If he is a father figure, spending Christmas morning with the kids is what he would do and I do know quite a few instances of a divorced couple sleeping in the same house Christmas eve so the kid can havr Christmas with both parents."
"&gt; He said she was pretty. Indulging him, I asked if he thought I was pretty too. He looked me in the eye and just said ""I've seen better.""

I am absolutely okay with my bf saying he finds another woman pretty / attractive. I know, objectively, I'm not a supermodel and there *probably* are a couple better looking women out there. But the moment my SO doesn't think of me as the most attractive person to him, something is *really* wrong.

This dude just took that, doubled it and basically admitted this specific other girl was waaay more attractive than OP to him."
"Blackish had a pretty funny episode about this. Bow, a doctor, acts all shitty to some woman she assumes is a housewife because of how devoted she is to her husband and how nice she looks and it turns out this woman is also a doctor. "
"Kate is sexually harassing and really, has already attempted to sexually assault you.  No means fucking no, Kate.  Tell your parents what's been going on.  They can help you tell your brother so that he doesn't shoot the messenger.  "
Even as just a normal guest at the wedding I would feel weird to eat and celebrate while the bride is fighting for her life. 
"Wait, she's an elderly dog? Holy shit, that makes this worse. "
"Try being supportive of him instead? Instead of being negative, say that's OK you fell off the wagon, time to get back on and try again. If you put him on the defensive, he'll revert back to what he knows as a stress mechanism - which is smoking. It's all about changing habits, that includes you as well as him."
"Speaking from my experience as a med-surg nurse, I would say no you are not overreacting.  Even if a patient is just suspected of having C. diff, we immediately start contact precautions and take a stool sample.  Essentially everyone has to wear special protective clothing and gloves while in the patient's room to avoid coming into direct contact with any contagious material, because it really is THAT contagious.  It's also really debilitating.  If you get it you will be shitting water for a week.  



That's not to mention the meds prescribed to treat this.  It's developed some resistance to antibiotics and therefore is usually treated with Vancomycin - a pretty toxic drug you don't want to be taking if you can avoid it.  Some people even require IV antibiotic treatment if the infection is bad enough, and you know what that means?  A nice week long trip to your local hospital.



TL;DR: don't go to your in-laws for Christmas. (wife shouldn't go either)"
"&gt;He's not surprising me.

Once again, I suspect you're not up to date on the definition of ""surprise"".

Your second explanation is confusing. First you said you're giving him his gift in person, then ""he doesn't know the gift isn't going straight to his family"". Now you're saying he knows you're not shipping it to his family because you can't afford it. Which is it? Does he know there's a second gift exchange, or does he think you're shipping it?"
Do you even have to pay for Sophie to go to college? I think you should probably refuse. She's had enough from you and obviously isn't grateful.
"So everyone is saying that there's a reason you broke up, but you didn't mention any red flags or insurmountable obstacles that you couldn't overcome. It would have been easy for him to not visit you in the hospital,  but he took the opportunity to be there for you in every way he could. I don't see a mistake here."
The reason why your fiance vetoed your **best friend** from being your groomsman is shallow and frankly BS. I get it that you don't care but seeing your friend's reaction I would have a talk with the gf and change things up to include him in the ceremony. 
"It doesn't really matter what clothes your girlfriend is wearing. I presume you are insecure about other guys seeing her in a sexual light, and that leading to her cheating. Well, people don't cheat because of their clothes. They cheat because of what's in their heart. If you trust your gf when she's wearing a sweater, you can trust her when she's wearing a crop top or whatever."
"I honestly have no idea why you posted. Every single person in this thread has told you that you're being dishonest. You refuse to hear it.

That's fine. If you want to cuddle up in your deep, dark pit of denial and continue to be a dishonest person with a giant hidden secret in your relationship, that's fine by me. Doesn't keep me up at nights.

Just get it off reddit. If you're not open to hearing you're wrong, stop posting. You sound like a troll at this point.

In fact, I'm reporting the post."
"And yet you think it’s okay to assault him and then blame it partially on him. 

He deserves much better than you. "
"Respectfully I disagree. My friend died in an accident, and her mother took great comfort from knowing he daughter was loved and appreciated by friends. "
"You haven't ruined your family. Your dad is actively ruining it.

My father and I have had a strained relationship since I was 12 and started having my own opinions. My father was dismissive and critical of me and my life choices. 

The final straw came when my husband (at the time) had just gotten a new job he was really excited about, and my dad said something cutting and cruel. 

We left the house immediately and I didn't respond to his phone calls for about six months. He then sent me a letter asking what he had done to make me ignore him. I wrote him a letter back explaining exactly what behavior over the years had made me determine a relationship with him was not worth it. 

He apologized and promised to change. I told him that we could try again but I wound absolutely not tolerate any negativity from him.

I have to say he has respected my boundaries for the last ten years. We aren't super close but we have maintained a relationship that's healthy. 

Sometimes you have to draw your line in the sand. Your dad might not react the way mine did, but either way your life will be less stressful. 

Same lines in the sand need to go for the rest of your family. Make it crystal clear that you will not be discussing your decisions regarding your dad with them. And then be prepared to follow up by leaving (or making them leave) if they try. 

As harsh as it sounds, your children are going to be a great impetus for them to change their behavior IF you stick to your guns. They aren't going to want to lose out on that. 

If you dad apologizes (which he may if you stay strong, although it may take some time) do not reinstate a relationship without making it clear you have a zero tolerance policy for his bullshit."
"You need to tell her all the reasons why it bothers you.  I think he brings it up to get back at her for breaking his heart.  And she is bringing it up maybe because it meant more to her than she is letting on?  

All that being said, people who describe themselves as having ""no shame"" or ""no filter"" are making excuses for being totally obnoxious  and immature and not wanting to be mature people and that is showing in their reactions with each other.  They are overgrown children and acting like it."
"I think whats more important here is that you find the actions hurtful and it's not what you want from your partner. 

That's all that you really need to know. Your boyfriend is under no obligation to change his habits and neither are you under any obligation to find that habit undesirable. 

If you don't want to continue to be disappointed by this, it is time to find a new boyfriend. "
"So he abused you. Imagine if an adult had done to Stan what he did. You wouldn't have a slightest hint of question. A twelve year old is plenty old enough to be expected not to push someone down the stairs, but especially not a six year old.

And your parents didn't protect you. I get that it's hard when the abuser is also your child, but being a parent us hard and they shirked their responsibility. Not only to you and Stan, but to Josh too since he never learned not to treat people like that. That will only get him into trouble as he gets older.

Why should you subject yourself to him? He has made no effort to apologise or change. You owe him no apology, and you parents owe you a huge one. 

Or you could follow their wishes and act as Josh did when he was ""the bigger person"" and break his leg."
"Just a thought, but quite often the ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" is used wrong and ALSO interpreted wrong by people n either side of the coin.  That statement doesn't mean that a cheater will always cheat no matter what, and that they can never change.  It does mean that if you are in a relationship and one person cheats on the other, they leave an indelible scar that marks them as a ""cheater"" and in that relationship they will always be labeled (at least in their partners mind) as a cheater.  **The partner can work to forgive them, they can work to get beyond that issue, they can move past the situation and heal, their relationship can survive and flourish, but that one thing isn't something the can be forgotten**.  That fact that it happened (and the knowledge that a partner has the capacity to do it again) will color all decisions, feeling, and relationship growth moving forward.  The action can not be erased and forgotten ... hence ""one a cheater, always a cheater"" **when it comes to that specific relationship**."
"It's great if you can afford it.  If you can't, you watch your community disintegrate.

There were people living in that ""shithole."" Some of them were there for generations.   They had roots there.  And they and their families were displaced for you and your family.  Your family is not more important and doesn't matter more than their families.  

You only enjoy living in Park Slope because the original community was displaced for you.  Surely you can see that and how painful that would be to people who are from those communities.  The majority couldn't afford to stay.  They were redlined into those neighborhoods and then priced out when wealthier people wanted the space.  The US has a grim history of displacing people -devaluing people while valuing the space they occupy.  

If you choose to live in those neighborhoods, then that is part of the heritage.  It didn't spring up overnight when it was convenient for you."
"Thank you, seriously. If ever I was accused of having sexual relations with my godmother simply because i wanted to spend time with her and the baby, then I would be furious.

His quote of 'you are making it seem like I am fucking her' seems extremely genuine, as hostile as it is. OP is seriously obsessive and not trusting at all."
"&gt; but after watching this I want to be like that. 

No. Do your own way. There's a reason why he's with you, and by your comments out there, you guys have a pretty good sexual life

By the way, you saw wild sex in the video, because it was a video.. it was a performance"
"Look I agree with you up to a point that people lash out but it is NEVER acceptable to call someone those kind of names. It IS abusive, degrading language. I’ve lashed out under stress and never reverted to that kind of name calling. If that’s your usual method of expressing anger you have some issues. 

They’re engaged, he knows what she does for a living and I guarantee this is isn’t the first time this issue has come up. He can be stressed, he can be disappointed, he can even be angry but he positively CAN’T express himself like that. 

OP maybe there’s another explanation here and yes you probably shouldn’t  just chuck your relationship without first hashing this out but he better have a damn good reason and a HUGE apology in his future or I would definitely reconsider your future."
"Yeah, I remember your original post, and I do believe I warned you that it was likely to get worse before it got better. This is the “worse” bit. 

If you’re done with the marriage, be done, and put you both out of your misery. But if you want to be forgiven for *years* of neglect and indifference, you’ll have to afford her the same patience and determination you want her to put in to forgiving you. You’ll get very little sympathy here if you double down on the victim mentality. "
"You're allowed to feel whatever feelings you have.  They're your feelings, presumably you can't control them.  However your BF is also allowed to feel excited about the upcoming birth of his niece for the same reasons.  If it's too difficult for you to hear about, then you should ask him to please not bring it up, and tell him why.  He shouldn't be telling you that you aren't allowed to feel sad, just as you shouldn't be telling him he isn't allowed to feel excited."
"As you get older, you start to value being upfront about potential dealbreakers and incompatibilities.  Why fall in love, build attachment and intimacy, when a relationship could fail simply because you didn't ask basic questions?  Avoiding the drama isn't a bad thing.

Religion, sex, finances, politics, children, life plan, gender roles, where you want to live etc.  All these things are basic things that test whether you can have a future.  If you can't agree or find a compromise, all the love in the world won't fix it."
"I have seen a few cases like this where it ends up coning out that the boyfriend is just progranmed to be a people pleaser. So the perfect boyfriend schtick is actually a lie because he's so afraid to upset others he just pretends to be what you want.

I knew a woman who had this come out while planning her wedding. 

Be very careful. 

"
"i think the major element to his point is that nobody gains 100 lbs overnight. that is a gradual process that would involve probably many conversations over a period of time. ignoring those conversations, having no self control and not working on yourself in that period of time would be all sorts of dealbreakers and red flags UP TO hitting that 100 lb mark or even close to it."
"feminism is about the freedom of choice. ladies can stay home or have a career. ladies can watch keeping up with the kardashians or read ""research"". or they can do it all. or none of it!
"
"I completely agree that the $200 from his mom should be shared, especially if money is tight and that is the play money. My family is significantly better off than my husband’s, and my cash gifts are usually 5x higher in value. We’ve always agreed to split the money and buy some nice things for ourselves and each other."
"I don't know, legally, just speculating. I don't think that supervised visitation happens automatically, and he probably had issues. 


As for the foster parent thing, I don't know. It's possible his immediate issues have been resolved, but they never bothered to change the legal custody agreement because the kids like having grandma there. It's possible that everything was filed in OP's name. It's possible that the state they live in is so desperate for foster parents that they accept almost anyone.

He is not a respectful person and this is just one more piece in the puzzle."
"Everyone's ignoring the fact that op might have asked...

Sometimes people in these situations ask questions that they don't really want to know the answer to"
"There's a difference between dating and FWB. Most relatkonships (in the US at least) start as dating, not FWB. In my experience, dating can come in a variety of forms and go lots of different places emotionally, but FWB tends not to develop into a relationship because it's a way of specifically labeling someone who's inappropriate to date."
I guess i should stay at my grandmother's house instead then
"An apology doesn't really mean much if this is a pattern of behavior. If she were actually sorry she'd be making the effort not to do these things in the first place. There are things you can't undo, and she may have done serious damage to that kid's progress in therapy. Sorry doesn't fix that.

Personally, I'd rather not get an apology at all than get one that comes with no change in behavior."
"It sounds like she wants more commitment than you. Let’s be real here, by your age and length of dating it’s super common to either live together, be engaged, or married. At your age you should have some basic timeline of what you want and when you want it. 

Actually consider your personal timeline and what it would involve (moving in at what point, engagement, etc). Then sit her down and give her a more concrete answer than “idk”. And if you can’t honestly commit to her the way she wants then break up so she can find someone else who wants the same as her. "
"Yeah, okay. So your girlfriend isn't overacting in the slightest in a scenario like this. You've been dating this girl for two years and your friends still think it's okay to bring up your past hook-ups in front of her? That's a jerk move on their part.

If my boyfriend or his friends kept bringing up old hook-ups after two years of dating in front of me, I would also think he wasn't happy with me or that he was still thinking about her. Are all of your examples like this one? I'm very curious to know what else your girlfriend is ""overreacting"" about."
"Frankly, his treatment of your daughter's is completely unacceptable.  If someone forceably restrained my child while they screamed, they would never see me or my child again.  If your family can't see why that's a problem, you don't need any of them."
"Is there any way at all that she has posted an old video to her Instagram? A throwback? She could be trying to rile you? If not I agree with everyone else here, ghost that fuck. "
I'm really really sad for the poor girl. It would have been much better if she had never discovered who her father was. She's being pushed out of OPs family so blatantly (the room thing is just flat out cruel) that she probably feels like she has to kick them out of her life to keep her sanity. At least she can pretend she made the decision to have no relationship with her father rather face the truth about how she has no place in her father's life.
"Honestly the fact that she was smiling before you explained indicates that either she enjoyed it (dude, ask her out) or she already knew you were asleep. Possible both.

And she let you sleep in her bed. That's a pretty big positive check for the she already likes you box. She'd have probably woken you up and told you to go downstairs or slept downstairs herself if she didn't want you in there.

Worst case senario. She says no. It hurts but you move on and stay friends"
"&gt; it turned into a full on fight where he accused me of not respecting his family, not respecting his traditions, he called me b!tch and c)nt more times that I can possibly count.

DUMP. HIM.

Absolutely nothing gives anyone the right to treat you that way, especially not somebody who claims to love you. Completely unacceptable."
He demanded that i apologize to my mom because she had good intentions -_-
"So you have been living happily off the alimony of the woman whose husband you cheated with...that’s pretty sick.  Idk how you were ok with taking her money to begin with.  Even if he did lie to you, your shit stinks too honey.

Edit:  And I can’t believe that you have the gall to say that sucking at the teat of his ex-wife was a “fresh start.” Come on."
"So yeah. You need to grow up and learn how to be around people you don't like. Or don't go. It was absolutely not your sister's job to ask you or your brother for your opinions especially as you aren't paying for it. Just be polite, focus on enjoying the scenery, stick with your brother for the most part if you can. Don't give your sister a reason to create an 'us vs. them' mentality. 

For what it's worth I share similar thoughts on people who drink and drive - I hate it and I don't respect those people. But I deal with it when I have to. You can too."
"Be a willing listener, not an active participant."
"Yes. If your coworker has come on here complaining about you forcefully kissing him in front of his fiancée, he would have been told to do everything he has done, especially after you trapped him in the elevator to talk about the kiss. Right now, just back away. You messed up, you are facing the consequences of your actions and your coworker and his fiancée never want to hear from you again. "
"&gt; But it absolutely effects how young men think their first encounter with a woman will go. 

This guy isn't a blushing virgin. He's 27 years old and he's had anal before. Stop making excuses for him. "
"&gt; this man

That seems a little generous. "
There's a strong chance that she did it on the friend's bed to make it even worse! 
"I think it all blew way out of proportion, but I think Tom should have dropped it when they said no in the first place. There's a massive difference from a ""family"" perspective between an SO of 10 years and one of less than 1 year, who they haven't even met. "
"But see, he isn't actually sorry. He says he has no currency with which to pay back that debt, but he does. He can respect your wishes to seek counseling together and do it on your own terms, without half-assing it. The fact that he doesn't want to address the main problem that caused you so much agony and misery over so many years just shows me that there isn't a lack of currency to pay you back with. He is just being stingy with it, hoping that you will just deal with whatever he gives you. He thinks pretending to put energy into counseling should be enough to shut you up and make you all ""nice"" again. If he really wanted to, he could make this up to you in a million ways. 

But, like I said...

He doesn't. He doesn't care. 
"
If I got a $200 dollar check from my mom for Xmas I would absolutely spend it on gifts for my wonderful husband. Who opens presents at Xmas in front of their wife and mother of their children and gives them nothing at all? He could at least share the gifts from work. I feel awful op is being treated so bad.
"Agreed. And since her boyfriend is so close with his family, I can see him building resentment over the years if his mother is consistently excluded, especially from life events like weddings, grandkids, ect."
"Yup, and when she doesn't wear them or talk about them for people to notice that makes her ungrateful and selfish."
I got Paul Bernardo/ Karla Homolka vibes off of your wife’s twin and her husband. Your wife should be careful. This sounds predatory. 
"Do not let her have this power, you are an adult and do not need her leave to do anything in your own home. You may live elsewhere but this is still your home and she has no authority over you. If she says don’t turn on the light, then you just get up and do so - you’re just letting her know it’s happening as a courtesy, not asking her permission. If she wants to play childish games, then she will have to do it without you granting her the power. 

She may be in a bad place now, but it’s not an excuse for mistreatment now or before. Maybe she’s trying to exert control in the old and familiar ways because she feels she has no control over the current situation, but if you do not empower her then she will find some other way to do it. You do not need to be confrontational if you want to prevent family issues, you simply have to act with confidence and authority and she will need to adapt to the reality of being a grown up. "
"He can say what he wants to your mutual friends - chances are that they'll see through it. 

I mean, they all saw you be a loyal girlfriend and do stuff like take care of his dog and make sure he had a place to stay - I'm pretty sure they'll be able to put two and two together. 

"
"Right, and I think it’s important to note that these ideas spring up from SOMEWHERE.  They’re never out of the blue.  Maybe his partner mentioned it because he himself has doubts about his own marriage and OP’s husband is afraid something might happen in his.  Maybe OP’s husband is surrounded by those kind of stories and wants insurance, so to speak.

Maybe he is just scared and nervous with all this change. (Hell, I would be!  You’re the one thing that’s constant in his life right now, something that tethers him back to a time when people liked him for him and not what he could do for them.  He probably just wants extra security that you’ll ALWAYS be that way for him).

I think he genuinely loves you.  A man who doesn’t care about his wife would just horde his money or tell her it’s not hers to use ever (not even for education or overall betterment).  However, he offered to pay for your education and everything as soon as this unexpected windfall happened.  That’s teamwork and partnership and shouldn’t be written off.  

I think this is a clumsy way of protecting what you guys had before the money and good fortunes.

"
"Taken by itself I'd say your boyfriend is one of those people who likes having pets but not doing the work of pet ownership. That's not necessarily a dealbreaker if you're ok with being the primary caregiver, and it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be a bad or lazy father if you have kids together. 

That said...taken with the detail you tried to slip in at the end about not even being willing to reach out to someone for a ride when you needed medical care, it is pretty damn horrifying. You're literally asking him for the bare minimum of care for your well-being and he's saying nah, no thanks. Trying to convince you that you're overreacting all the time is another HUGE red flag.

What are you getting out of this relationship? Does it outweigh being with someone who is this level of lazy and selfish? Trust your gut."
"What's awesome is that instead of raging against the machine you're aware of social norms and professional behavior and have a wig to wear when necessary. 

It was the same for me at my old job which was a lot of traveling and consulting. Clients often wouldn't recognize me in a t-shirt and a pair of shorts at the grocery store. Seeing me in a casual environment however didn't change their opinion on my skillset because I'd already established myself as a professional. In a perfect world nobody would judge a person based on appearance but we don't live in a perfect world. It's not selling out when you simply accept there's unwritten standards in place, it's just being a grown up."
Right? Like people who concoct imaginary hypotheticals like that are nuts. 
"&gt; my student is very bright
&gt;Whenever I'm around her, she does homework and everything fine
&gt;She needs to fix her habit of forgetting to do homework/handing it in, not studying for tests, forgetting test dates (and not even knowing what date the tests are!) 
&gt;it just always seems like whenever I say something, it always goes into one ear and out the other

Has your student been evaluated for ADHD? It could be laziness or bad habits, sure, but it could also be something else- and if it is, better to get it fixed up now while she can still learn good study skills rather than crashing and burning in college. "
"It is possible that your girlfriend was trying to pressure you into saying yes, but I wouldn’t make that assumption before talking to her about it. It’s possible that she got so caught up in what would be exciting for her that she truly didn’t grasp that you wouldn’t like it. In other words, “never attribute to malice what ignorance can explain.”

If you walk in to a conversation about this assuming the worst of her, you’re really walking into a fight that your relationship probably won’t survive. It may be that you don’t want this relationship to continue at all, but if you do, this is going to be a huge area of compromise, where one of you is sacrificing what you want for the sake of the other.

Generally, whether you stay with her or not, you may want to clarify your boundaries around commitment and marriage with your partner before several years have passed."
"Go visit with her - your mom certainly doesn’t need to know because she has no right to know. 

What a fun mom she was eh? Using her child to certify her awful feelings, using her child to funnel her anger and pettiness, and using her child to drive a wedge. 

She had no one to blame but herself, forcing YOU to carry the burden was awful of her and I’m sorry you had to deal with that. 

You have the opportunity to meet your sister, get to know her, and bond with (hopefully) normal family members. Enjoy your time with her and certainly don’t feel beholden to telling your mom what you’ve been up to. "

"Don't confuse politeness with flirting. I've had guys tell me they knew I was into them because of the way I looked at them. It was all in their head because idk what 'look' they were talking about. Anyone can convince themselves of things that aren't true. Sounds like you're in love with the idea of this girl who you don't even really know anything about. She's an actual person, so don't put her on a pedistal. If you're interested, ask her out. Then you will get your answer. "
"I hear SO much about your needs in your post and SO little sympathy for your wife, who is clearly overwhelmed with caring for two small children. She is uniquely physically and emotionally vulnerable, especially in the first few months postpartum, and you should know that. Frankly as someone who had a baby not that long ago I don’t have a lot of sympathy for you. I would advise you to table this, masturbate discreetly, and do not raise the issue again until your wife has had time to recover from pregnancy and birth.  "
"It's such a common trope isn't it? Some men love a good wounded bird. Question, if they were at a party and someone saw him go into her room and texted his girlfriend in the AM then who else heard/why did no one else come to help L with her super loud, nightmare panic attack?"
"Just fyi that's a super common reaction from the anaesthesia so it wasn't even your choice, that with the pain and your body just reacts without any thought whatsoever. I've had 5 surgeries and after my first 2 (the bigger procedures) I woke up and discovered I was crying even though I was unconscious. The first time oh man I was full on balling and crying out (in the wrong language mind you) for my super awesome Dad who had flown out to my country to be there for me. I was in my mid twenties so I'd expect a child to have a much more extreme reaction. I've also noticed that I'm more likely to have this reaction if the surgeon takes too long to give me pain relief when I'm in the recovery area, it just becomes too much For my body to handle and it's natural reaction is to cry out for help.

I've usually had pretty understanding nurses but one nurse lost her shit on me after she tried to move me, did it inappropriately and hurt me badly. It wasn't even 24 hours after surgery and the pain she caused was worse then anything I've  ever experienced. She basically claimed that I was being a disrespectful brat kid and how dare I cry and talk back to her (I was an adult btw not a kid and she was doing something dangerous and very painful so I had to ask her to stop and wait for more assistance). She was one of those older women that hate other women and kids for being younger and look for any way to exact revenge upon them. I reported her to the head nurse and I was taken seriously thank God but imagine if I was a teenager or  if I didn't have a witness. People like that shouldn't work in fields where you have to give a damn it's so scary to have your life literally in their hands. I bet OP's brother is going tkt act like this and really mess some kids up. "
"I would strongly suggest you seek some therapy for yourself. You've been through a trauma and a huge life change. You have a lot to work out in terms of whether caretaking your bf for the rest of your life is what you're signed up for at age 22. You will be dealing with strong feelings of grief, mourning, guilt, resentment and anger. You will have a lot of hard choices to make.

Having a professional to help you cope with and sort through all of this will help you enormously. "

"Having a mental illness does not excuse you from the consequences. It sounds like her husband understands the PPD as he says he's glad she got the help she needed.

So he doesn't need to do anything except do what's best for him and his child. It's a really shitty situation and I feel for both OP and her husband. It's possible there's no coming back from this. "

I feel like your parents are dropping the ball her.  I would tell the adoption agency that you won't be taking care of them at any point.  There are plenty of people out there who want to adopt kids like this and can give them a great home.  But something like this requires the family to agreed to it.  Growing up I've known some people with down syndrome and at the age of 50 I don't think your parents are going to be able to keep up with the.  What are they going to be? A 60 yo  Person trying to keep up with a 10 year old kid with down syndrome? It's really hard to do.  Your parents should have adopted a very long time ago.  From my experience a kid with down syndrome requires constant care throughout their entire life and your parents are the literally passed that point of being able to take care of a child.   Be honest with your parents and the adoption agency.  The kid will find a home.  But your parents will be in their late sixties or dead  By the time the kids barely even an adult.

They live in a large apartment building and I think the neighbors are kind of clued in as to what is going on, maybe they'll think it's one of them? 

I work in a very secure building with badge access to all interior and exterior doors, so I feel pretty safe at work (I'm not sure if she even knows where I work). They also don't know where I live (just what side of town but not the neighborhood-they aren't allowed to come over because she already had a meltdown about how I live in a house and she has to live in an apartment..) we do have trail cams up though just to be cautious!"

Family comments? Been there too. For some reason it's everyone's favorite thing to start picking at anything that's new. Some of them really mean well like my SIL (she had a eating disorder) and others well just shut them down. They don't have a right to make a comment. 

Husband. If your calorie counting is preventing you from date nights, try to make them happen, it sucks to be limited to a salad with dressing and toppings on the side depending on where you go, but it might be worth it for your husband if you did that sometimes so he doesn't feel like things are changing too much. If you're already doing that it might be worth it to look into couples counseling. So you guys can talk out these changes and what they mean for you and how they make the other feel. Maybe he will get individual therapy and start his journey to a healthier life once he gets rid of these insecurities he has. "
"I also don't get particularly personal gifts from my SO's family, often just one gift from them collectively. Perhaps this will change when you are married, and therefore ""officially"" a part of your family, but equally I don't think it's unusual for them to just get you a token gift of sorts, especially if they don't see you often.

However, I'd just mention it to your fiance. Obviously do be careful with phrasing, but you should be able to ask if he's noticed the sorts of gifts you receive."

"Your husband might honestly believe it's normal to use coke and that there should be no negative reactions to you using coke, but that is a belief he should discuss with you and absolutly not lie to you to make you comply with his beliefs. That's theabsolutly biggest issue here; he lied to you. But other issues include him not discussing important moral decisions with you, not discussin parental desicions with you, underminding you as a parent, and making your son lie to you.

Your husbands argument that you are a unreasonable person with whom there is no chance of discussong important issues with is insulting and an unacceptable attitude in a healthy relationship. It might have merit if you had a history of being unreasonable or over emotional, but even then it's something to discuss with you rather than lie to avoid. Also, from how you describe your actions of trying to actually talk with your son about his drus use it doesn't seem like you are unreasonable or over emotional. Your husbands actions here have shown that he doesn't not trust you in important matter and will manipulate you to cut out your input in such matters. There is no trust or communication. How is there to be an healthy relationship in such conditions.

Your husbands decisions that his opinion about how to deal with your son trumps yours is also an unhealthy attitude, but not just in your marriage, but for you as a parent and for your son. Your husband manipulating your relationsp woth your son does damage to your relationship, because manipulation is the opposite of healthy. The incredible obviousness of the manipulation also hurts your son who gets put in an position to choose between covering for his dad or telling the truth to his mum, essentially choosing between you, being made to be a liar, to be responsible for covering for his dad, and to think of his mum as the villain he has to work against. Your husbands argument that he was looking out for your son is completly undone by the damage he did by making your son lie to you to cover for his dad.

A lie this serious (the health of your son and your decions ability as a parent) and that drags other people into his lies should not just be swept under the rug by excusing him for having good intentions. This needs to be adressed and dealth with properly. Your husband needs to be able to ackowledge how disrespectful and hurtful his actions were and commit to rebuilding the trust in the relationship. Again because of the seriousness of the lie marriage councelling is the minimum requirement. Minimum! Honestly, there are people who would divorce their partner for blatantly lying to them about their childs drug use. Take some time to properly process this and to try to sort out how you are feeling before you start commiting to any path foreward. You have a right to be very angry here, and the right to take the time to figure out what actions you want your anger to fuel.

Also, for what it's worth your husbands reasoning is shit. There are studies about alcohol and drug use that shows that the more permissive attitude towards alcohol and drugs projected in the home the more likely the children are to use as well use more intensly. A parent can't completly stop a child from using alcohol and drugs, but their attitudes does have an clear effect on the usage. Your husband telling your son that using coke is normal have normalised drug use for your son. That's not good parenting. It's also the matter of your husband openly lying to you in front of your son that normalises lying and manipulation to your son, which again is super bad parenting. Your husbands reasoning has nothing to do with actually healthy or reasonable parenting and seems more to be about being the ""cool"" dad that isn't like that buzzkill mum, and is essentially trying to bond with your son at the expense of your sons relationship with you. So don't doubt yourself or your parenting. You are way ahead of your husband on such matters and need to trust your own instincts rather than his (flawed) arguments."

I'm gonna throw this out there – from what you describe of yourself, I would categorize you as ""conventionally attractive"" – which means that there's going to be different social roles that you fit into compared to your less confident, less outgoing friends. 

There's a whole bunch of societal expectations wrapped up around being attractive, one of the more insidious of which is that attractive people are also expected to be self-confident and *especially* attractive men are expected to be assertive. 

I *suspect* that when women see you within a group of your friends (who are mostly women themselves, I see in another post of yours), they're quite frankly too intimidated to approach you themselves. There's going to be an *expectation* that – as an attractive man – if you're interested in someone, *you'd* make that known. When they're not seeing this happen, they're assuming you aren't interested, and not making the first move to protect themselves from the possibility of being rejected. 

There's a similar thing that extremely attractive women experience, where they paradoxically almost never get hit on because the majority of interested partners just automatically assume that this person would be out of their league. 

One other random thought I'm just going to throw out as a possibility – it sucks that this is still an issue in the modern world, but when you describe yourself as ""not very macho"" (don't feel any pressure to change this, be your own self!), do you think that there might be any chance that people are perceiving you as gay?

I want to be very clear on this, I think stereotypes are bullshit and that men of any orientation should be free to pursue whatever interests they damn well please. To be frank, the reason I'm asking this is that I've had experiences in my own past where women were surprised to find out I was straight, because I made the effort to *dress well* - times have certainly changed since then and I'd hope that most people don't buy into stereotypes to this extent any more, but I can't confidently say that this might not be a factor.

"&gt;Reddit, I am vacillating between feeling super guilty and like a failure and feeling misunderstood and pressured. Of course I don’t want my amazing husband to feel alone! But on the other hand, I am 18 weeks pregnant, still nauseous all the time, not sleeping well and recovering from a major mental health crisis. Maybe I’m not doing EVERYTHING I can, but it’s pretty close.



I think what your husband is telling you is that his spoons are running out, too.


I've been in his position before with a partner that went through similar crisis (although no pregnancy of course). And it's just, just an awful and helpless and lonely and despairing and yes, *angering* situation.


And the worst part about it all is that my feelings were utterly ignored because he was going through something worse. I couldn't seek validation for my own struggle when his seemed so much more serious. I couldn't seek support from him for myself when he couldn't even support himself.


Make him feel like he can come to you with his feelings. He desperately needs someone to listen to *him*. You don't need to feel guilty and miserable - and in fact, if you do, all you do is reinforce to him that he *can't* come to you for fear of doing you more harm. Of course he said it after the crisis passed. How could he have possibly burdened you more during your crisis?


Just listen to him! Just allow him to feel sad and exhausted and frustrated and mad and all those negative things he feels. They are *not* an inditement of you! They're just totally normal reactions to a blameless situation.


Like, it's great you're getting the lunches together but what he needs is emotional support. Someone to listen to him rant about how much this all sucks and someone who can listen to it be all about him for once. Don't turn it around and say it makes you feel bad; ask him what makes *him* feel bad. Acknowledge it out loud. Validate it. 


If you think you can't do that for him right now, then you really should encourage him to see his own therapist. He needs someone to have his back in order to be able to have your back. "
"Not only that but in the comments she asked how someone could raise their kids and possibly spend time looking pretty (aka wearing makeup).

As I see it, it was self defence and that your coworkers should be ashamed of them selfs! They saw one part of the whole story and as grown ups they should shut their mouths until they heard both sides. Yeah sure they don't know your husband but you should never just listen to one side of ANY story. But you don't need to quit your job because of this.

Also, she isn't ""kind to everyone else""--she has made an M.O. out of targeting people close to your sister. As soon as you're able to see it from this point of view, congratulate yourself on being the breaking point in this horrible relationship, but know that the breaking point could almost just as easily have been something else."
The puppy was “adopted” through a facebook post and from OPs comments it lives with the GF and she’s the one who actually takes it to the vet while he helps with expenses.  No mention of a license or a microchip but I’m guessing that the vet paperwork is all in the GFs name since she arranged the neuter surgery.  Chips are usually put in during surgery unless the pet goes through the shelter system so I’m willing to bet since they broke up it’s all in GFs name now.

"Yeah this is what I was thinking as well. This was part of a display for him. OP either felt pressured into accepting, even though he knew she didnt want it, or she would make him look good by saying no and he could reap all the sympathy.

Ditch this guy OP. Seriously, he had zero respect for your words of I dont want to get married. If he had been sincere about changing your mind he would have talked to you in private about it first.

I did end up with a guy like this, he took my words of child free and said oops I thought you were joking after I got pregnant. Also, your mom said you wanted kids so we knew that after you had a baby you would be happy!

No. You do not love someone in a month, full stop. I understand that it is amazing to finally feel a strong connection to someone, but it's not love. Having issues feeling connected to people and closing yourself off is not a reason to rush into something, because no amount of desire can ever change the reality that at one month you simply do not know a person well enough to constitute love in a meaningful sense.

Please reflect carefully on that. You are hurt and angry that things ended for a stupid reason, but if you want to defend or rationalize why you allowed your emotions to get so carried away, you need to talk to your therapist about this and work on skills to prevent it in the future. It's not healthy to feel this level of attachment to someone who is practically a stranger."

"There is a huge difference between ""emotional"" and this. It might be ""worth a discussion"" if he had just gotten upset, but the name calling is a huge red flag. A successful relationship is one in which both parties can (generally) disagree in a civil manner. You can come back from an argument. You can't come back from calling your so those kinds of names. Unless OP wants to deal with this kind of treatment in the future, she should leave."
"Educate her on her power in this situation. If she want to leave she needs all of her essential paperwork, social security, birth certificate etc. Her parents cannot deny her those documents legally. She can even call the non emergency police line to get help if her parents won’t cooperate. 

Also she should check out tenancy laws. There’s a solid chance her parents can’t legally kick her out so if she starts pushing back there’s not really a whole lot they can do. 

Basically just empower her as much as you can so she can leave on her own. "
"2017 Russell Crowe is a slab of hot stuff, seriously. I'm only 18 and I would climb that. "
"I'm not a fan of tough love. It sounds like he is unhappy with you and being unhappy alone is even worse. People react best to positive attention, not negative.

I say sit down with your son and have a heart to heart about what he wants to do in life, what his dream job is and what it would take to get there. What did he tell you he wanted to be when he was a kid? Make a step-by-step plan and encourage him to do it. Be patient, he might have to enrol in a course and stay with you for longer.

I also agree with the depression issue. Everything good might seem out of reach and he doesn't know what to do or where to even begin. 

Also, take an interest in what he is doing online and in his other time and try to make something positive out of that. He likes playing games? Suggest he starts a youtube channel or Twitch. He likes Reddit? Suggest he try writing some articles on topics he likes.  He likes movies? Start a movie review blog. These definitely aren't big things but seeing a little bit of productivity in your life can make a big deal and it might turn into something he can add to his CV."

"My husband put his mom in her place repeatedly until she finally got it. She hated me because i ""changed him"". We are both introverts and she isn't and thinks i made him into one. He defended me and basically told her she didn't know him. She was angry because we werent having a wedding. My husband shut her down and basically told her to deal with it. She was mad we didn't invite her to the ""wedding"" in which my friend came over and signed the paperwork. She then got mad because we weren't having kids(i already have a kid from a previous relationship). Husband shut that down. 

Thankfully she has learned her place and doesn't complain about me anymore and she knows my husband is ALWAYS in my corner and will back me up, and not her. Had he always been in her corner i would not have married him because my husband is supposed to me MY partner, definitely not his mothers. "

Offhand I can’t think of a single legitimate reason why someone would put mom as a contact when their mom is dead. 

I can, however, easily think of illegitimate reasons why someone would do this.

Get the number for “mom.” Call it from someone else’s phone, or google the number to see if you can tie it to someone specific. Once you have some info (without letting on to “mom” who you are), talk to your bf about it but don’t let on you know more than you do. Ask him a bunch of questions. See if he lies. His answers will tell you whether to trust him or not.

"I could tell you do what makes you happy, you're an adult etc...

The age gap is a huge cause for concern too, relationships are tough at the best of times. Add this to the equation and most of the time it ends in emotional trauma.

"Ultimately it's your sister's decision regarding the child. She needs to consider all facets on it, including if she still would want to parent the child if she had to do it as a single parent. A child shouldn't be brought into the world as a way to save a dying relationship.

Additionally, i have a hard time believing in multiple accidental pregnancies. There is an abundance of  resources for preventing pregnancy and since she had become pregnant accidentally before, she should be well aware. Choosing not to actively prevent pregnancy is being open to pregnancy and that's something her and this man should have discussed beforehand. Honestly, I don't believe it was an accident at all.

Your role as her sister is to be supportive and help her talk through the situation and clarify what she wants to do with regards to the baby and this seemingly dysfunctional relationship. If you have the money or time to help her with childcare, that'd probably be well appreciated."

He is 18 years old. He is responsible for his actions. End of story.
I bet he’s gonna try to bang girls at your place while you’re away and your cat watches. 
"It would be better if you take some time to work through your anger and let it simmer before you speak with her.       
Otherwise, you are going to be speaking in anger and it will not turn out well. 

If it turns out that your anger does not subside, you probably do not need to be in a relationship with this person. "
It's also possible he's treating his new wife like shit but just hides it. Guys do that.
No.  You’re not paying for the vacation and you’re not the one dating him.  
"&gt; takes it as a personal betrayal that I made an inappropriate joke with her 

Have a go at putting yourself in your wife's shoes based on the history that you know and try see things as she does.

Humour me - Why do you think she sees it as a personal betrayal?"
"He's being selfish and unfair. If he's not ready to commit, you're right, that's his choice. But it's wrong of him to tell *you* not to commit. Basically, he wants you to sit around and wait until he's ready for you, and that's no way to treat a person."
"Her mother is your customer, not her. And she's not paying you anyway. I would set up a cancellation fee if she cancels the day of or day before. I would find a new student as well, kid doesn't give a shit and is ducking you."
"Honestly there are “consequences to your actions” your cousin hurt someone he cared about and it hurt him too so he reacted. Defending your cousin because she’s regretful doesn’t change the fact she stepped out on her marriage and devastated people around her. I know you are loyal to her but come on she’s the one who put everyone in a crappy situation by being with another man. I commend him for standing up for his friend and the act of marriage. Lots of people who cheat loose friends and just because she’s a relative doesn’t mean she gets any special treatment. He will never look at her the same. Just how you are defending her, he was defending him. "
"She *definitely* doesn't love her pets.

I don't even like going away for 24 hours and leaving my dog because I know that she misses me and I miss her when I'm away. I went on vacation this summer for 5 days and I called the kennel EVERY single day to get an update on how she and my boyfriend's dog were doing... but I needed to hear that they were happy and safe. Was it overkill? Probably. But I was happier knowing that my dogs were well-taken care of. 

Shoot, it's cruel that she just leaves the dogs out in the yard unless she lives out on a farm and they're farm dogs. Otherwise, those dogs deserve to be inside where it is warm and dry and with someone to love on them.

Just feeding them is *not* taking care of them at all. "
"Both.  Brace yourself for fallout from your parents if the agency decides not to place the kid in their home because of what you said, but you owe it to your siblings and this kid and also to yourself to be honest with everyone.   "
"My brother is special needs - he's 40, with the capabilities of a six-month old. I love him to bits. We are so lucky that he's a gentle, easy-going soul, and we're even MORE lucky that my mother and father has enough money and good insurance to care for him in such a way that no one is left wanting. 

Now let me tell you about the six other families I personally knew who straight-up broke when they found themselves incapable of caring for their own special needs children or siblings: all are currently divorced. Some are estranged. And there were five murders in the wake. These are neighbors, distant friends, classmates to my brother at the school he went to until he turned 21. 

Do not romanticize the life that comes part and parcel with having a special needs child in one's life. Some can take it. I can honesty say that I am a stronger, more fierce person because my brother is in my life. But I have seen MANY families be torn apart, special needs children abused, siblings left to fend for themselves, and things ending in terrible, terrible violence because they weren't prepared or privileged enough to handle the full extent of a child's care. "
"EXACTLY! Also, OP:

&gt; He couldn't understand why and told me I was being shallow to put so much emphasis on physical traits.

No wonder you are still feeling so messed up by this; he really manipulated the crap out of his own argument! He told you all this stuff about how your boobs weren't good enough, but then said *you* were the one focusing on physical traits?!?! Just...

...sorry...

...I think my head exploded.

Look, **I've been there.** I was 20 when I met this guy who also had porn induced ED. At first I was convinced I was hideous, that it was my fault. Then one night we're at this party playing a drinking game; someone says ""never have I ever masturbated more than 6 times in one day."" A couple people still remaining. ""Never have I masturbated more than 9 times a day."" Boyfriend still standing. ""Never have I masturbated more than 11 times a day.""

You get the picture.

It finally came out that my guy had this crazy PMO addiction. I'm familiar with NoFap. It helped, but we still spent 5 very turbulent years breaking up and getting back together: me, always assuming I'm not good enough; him, always falling off the horse. It got to the point that I'd break up just to see other people for awhile and boost my confidence. I'd feel better, he'd promise he'd changed... etc etc etc. FOR FIVE YEARS. And we could never get that trust back. I could never trust that he was truly into me; he could never trust that I wasn't going to just disappear and hook up with other people. 

It was honestly very toxic. I posted to NoFap about 4 years ago, if you look through my submissions you can find it. Honestly I was suicidal and just looking for any help... I can so feel for you! 

I wish I could have just gotten out sooner. My self esteem was so damaged though, I couldn't get out! *Don't* let this be you. Whether you stay together or not, the main problem I see here is that you are questioning your own worth, beauty and value. **You are putting too much stock into his pants to decide how worthy you are today.** Girl. I was there. Please, please, please... please at least help yourself. Whether you break up or not, find some way to work on your own self image *yesterday.* Deciding if you want to stay can happen and is easier to do when you see and deeply know your own self worth.

The only way I got out was to literally leave the country. It hurt so badly, but in retrospect, I'm so damn glad. The funny thing was, there were always suitors. I was pretty hot too, in those days. But no amount of attention could have fixed my own self image that was honestly not too good even before I met my ex. Therapy (a GOOD therapist, I had to go through like, 5 therapists to find a good one) helped me immensely. Also art and music and travel.

Whatever you have to do to help yourself see your beauty, do it. That's priority number one. Honestly, once you start feeling better about yourself, it might not be so hard to leave the guy that made you feel like sh*t eating your dust.

"If this was my BF at my parents' house, I'd be kind of pissed. If he just absolutely cannot go another day without fapping to porn, I'd expect him to make damn sure he was exceptionally discreet. 

In any case, I bet he'll never make a porn-related mistake with a girlfriend's family again. "
"Don't forget the classic ""You're so mature for your age"" and ""You're not like the other kids."" "
Because if you like and enjoy sex it feels gross and unsatifying and vaguely rapey and just a complete turn-off to have sex with a partner that isn’t also into it and enjoying it but is just detached and feels nothing and is just putting up with it. Part of what’s enjoyable about sex for normal people is that it’s meant to be mutually pleasurable and satisfying. Your views on sex make you sexually incompatible with your boyfriend and with most healthy people. 
"Pursuing a married woman is a terrible idea. And even worse because you're engaged. How would you feel if your fiancé was telling a man from work that she could make him happier and pursuing him?

Also, you may want to think about your feelings towards your fiancé. Are you really truly in love with her if you're so fixated on this other woman? "
"This post should be #1 (and likely will be). Men and women speak different languages, and this post is like google translating your way into your wife's brain. You've done nothing wrong, yet this isn't about whether you did anything wrong, it's about how your actions make your wife feel.

I will say that I think this post excessively separates bosses/colleagues from friends, as many of my colleagues/bosses I consider to be friends with whom I'd happily go to happy hour, but the essence of this post is absolutely spot on and should be listened to over every other post on this page :)"
"If your girlfriend is a typically reasonable person (not overly clingy, doesn't freak out about you spending time alone with friends, etc), then I'm wondering if you've ever taken a vacation together? If not, this may be a weird, emotional response to ""he wants to take a week-long vacation with his dad but hasn't ever taken a vacation with me...""  Especially if you're usually more conservative with your time off work / finances but are quickly clearing your schedule for your dad. None of that is a logical response on her part, but sometimes understanding what's driving an illogical response can help to work through it. So go on this trip with Dad &amp; do some father / son bonding, but also try to figure out why this is bothering your girlfriend so much."
"My boyfriend has recently asked my father for his blessing and he said, ""her mom and I approve, but it ain't up to me. You gotta ask her first."" I think that's so funny and ironic because my dad has always drilled into me about how tradition he wants my relationship to be and all that jazz. For him to nonchalantly give his blessings, I just had to laugh.

But anyways, I'm ecstatic that my parents approved and that my boyfriend will be proposing to me soon! I just don't know when..."
"Totally agree.  I have some male mentors (who are quite older than me) and I would be mortified if they talked about me ""trailing"" behind them or how they were a ""proud papa bear"".  The latter term alone would be enough for me to be vaguely grossed out and to stop reaching out to them.  

Also, I know of a guy in my office that also hit it off with a bunch of new female hires.  He was about a decade older than them (so not a huge gap) but took them under his wing in a ""my girls"" sort of way, where he showered them with compliments, gifts, took them out to lunch, was constantly texting them, etc and it raised quite a few eyebrows at work. He was ultimately told to ""tone it down"" by a manager.  "
I actually don't care much if I see him. I saw him out of the corner of my eye at the gym a week after everything happened and didn't think anything of it. He avoided me though.
"It means she values quality of life over quantity. There are several different levels of DNRs, from no lifesaving measures at all (like blood transfusions, stuff you could call “heroic measures”) to not wanting CPR if her heart has already stopped beating. 

This is a highly personal decision that your mother has obviously had a lot of time to think about and I strongly urge you to respect her wishes, even if you do not agree with them. 

Furthermore, I think you should consider therapy to help you process all of this. This is a lot to deal with at a young age. "
"I have. She said to just find another diet or eat less, so I'm basically on my own with this one."
"Just because people are worse off doesn't write off other people's problems because they're ""not as bad"". OPs fiancé is acting like an uncaring partner and that's absolutely an issue to deal with. If nobody ever made a fuss over their ""not as bad problems"" then everyone would be miserable all the time just letting it go."
"Contrary to what other commenter have said, I don't think you've done anything wrong. You didn't ""make him present as female"" or force him to visit your family or anything. You told him he could visit with you or not, and that if he did, you'd tell your family that he was a guy. He *chose* by himself to present as female.

It sounds like you're very conscious of how he may be feeling right now, and that he might be uncomfortable. You shouldn't feel guilty, especially not about the abstinence thing. That's important to you, and if Alex doesn't want that then he doesn't have to be in the relationship.

As for going to church, presenting female, and other stuff during this visit. Sometimes relationships are a bit unbalanced. Sometimes one person goes through more discomfort than the other person, because they care about them. There will probably be points in your relationship when you step out of your comfort zone to make Alex more comfortable, happy, or just to avoid rocking the boat with his family or friends. And that will be your choice, just as it's his choice to do those things for you now.

I'd advise talking to him in private. Don't apologize unless he makes it clear he's upset, but thank him for being an amazing boyfriend during this trip. Tell him he can come to you if he's uncomfortable with anything with your family, or uncomfortable going to something or participating in something. Make sure he knows you have his back, and tell him that you want him to be happy and comfortable. If he assures you that he's really okay, and doesn't ask for your help with anything, then honestly I'd say drop it. It can be annoying to have a partner constantly asking if you're okay, cause it makes you feel fragile. Other than that, just enjoy your holidays.

It sounds like you're already being a pretty good boyfriend. Just remember how selfless he was when it's your turn to make little sacrifices for him, and remember to communicate."
"You need to decide how far you are willing to push it. Your sister isn't going to pay. It's either small claims court or give up. 

It better be clear in your emails that she would pay you, if you choose court. 

Either way. You now know cash up front. "
"Oh, I get it. Actually, I tend to forget this, but some people don't want to text anyone when they have guests because they think it's rude. Still, he could have found a minute in the day for you. I hope this gets resolved. "
"i feel like you'd both be better off if you ended it, if only because neither of you are what you need in a relationship. that's not a bad thing and not something to feel guilty about. if you decide to break up with him and you do really love him and want to keep him in your life as friends, let him know that. he won't feel completely rejected if you remain a supportive friend.

as a side note, nobody owes you a disclosure about their sexuality before you enter a relationship. as a bi person we often have to deal with people thinking we've lied to them about one thing or another. not telling you because it hasn't come up or he didn't quite know before you guys started dating isn't hiding something from you. being so young, it's very possible he just wasn't sure and didn't want to tell you or anyone else before he was certain. it definitely sounds like he has some more experimenting and exploring to do."
"Yes you are right to feel weird, most people wouldn't ask their SO for a gift so far outside their budget...and most people try to give a gift of the approximate value that they expect to get, and feel awkward afterward if things aren't about even. 

This situation makes it seem like your bf feels comfortable taking advantage of you."
"The only possible way out of here is couples counseling. I'd also recommend the book His Needs, Her Needs and the Marriage Builder website, which has an extensive section on infidelity. 

You acknowledge your own guilt in your priorities, but I don't know if you recognize the true extent of the damage caused by them. Your wife had basic emotional needs unmet for years. That absolutely contributed to the unhealthy closeness in her relationship with this colleague. That didn't excuse her deception in resuming secret contact with him, but it's still important to put the entire situation in context. She rightfully lost trust in your ability and willingness to consider her and her needs. You've now rightfully lost trust in her honesty and faithfulness. To make this work you *both* need to be willing to work to rebuild trust.

Honestly, unless there were lines clearly crossed, such as talk of love, romance, or sexting, I would not tell his wife. I would instead all your wife whether she wantsto stay married and decide if the two of you are both willing to work on things with a counselor. Both of you need to be willing to work and compromise."
"It is his way of telling you that he wants to be exclusive with you.

Is that what you want?  If so, tell him you will too.  If not, tell him you have no desire to be exclusive.

You are complicating this."
"If Bea wasn't sexually abused, it would be a miracle. The baby could possibly be Bea's- perhaps she gave birth early.

Bea needs help. It's unhealthy that her father is that controlling, that she was calling you ""Mom"" after 6 months and perhaps less than a year after her mother died.

The thing I'm left with is why is he in contact with you again? I know that after a major death, things are intense but you were with him for six month and the relationship ended 5 years ago- why is he contacting you about getting back together? Is the person you texted with really Bea? Do you think you could really help Bea? I'd talk to a social worker or a therapist. I'm not trying to discount your desire to help her (I applaud it), but as wrong as incest is, she's 19. Incest probably isn't illegal and I'm not sure how much help you can offer her."
"You think she's overreacting but that shows that you have little clue as to what the consequenses are of trying to romanticize a platonic friendship.  You did ruin everything with that confession. I don't even understand why you said it? You have been friends for so many years, if she was interested in you romantically it would have come out a long time ago. 

And also really bad timing. Never prey on a friend, for romantic interest, who just ended a relationship.. and especially when that wasn't by his or her own choice. "
"So far just over Facebook messenger. I was chatting with Tom and Bea at the same time and they were both ""typing"" at the same time. I'll suggest video chat soon just to be sure because I've thought the same thing.

I have a therapy appointment next week and I'll be sure to bring this up"
I have but she gets defensive and acts like I’m being far too sensitive. Maybe I am. My mom has always been the less emotional of my parents. She’s very tough and before my dad died I really didn’t see her cry very much. She just doesn’t think things like that should be a big deal. I’m also really afraid to talk to her about it anymore. She’s been through so much in the last year and a half I don’t want to cause her more pain or upset her more.
